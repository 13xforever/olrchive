00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, July 13th, 2008

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
A major lawsuit happens in the music game world

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Mega Man 9 is set to go multi-platform

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
And we take calls on your predictions for this year's E3

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
My name is Rob Roberts and join me as always

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Yo

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
How you doing, Jamie?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Warm

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Warm, yeah, it's not quite as horrid, the temperature this week

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
But we still are combating some issues here in California

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Not just the heat, but the smoke was terrible

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Like Wednesday or Thursday, oh my gosh

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I am making use of Consumer Reports

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
It was like a volcano erupted, how's that?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
To look for air conditioners

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Oh, hooray

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Another idea I have is an evaporative air cooler

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Nice, now we have a little ghetto set up today that's working fairly decent

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Because I'm a genius

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
But thank god it's not 103 like last week

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I think this week it's 93, so hot, but not scorching hot

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Also hot every week, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Yes, I am, I run very hot

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
How are you doing?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
It looks like you shaved your head almost completely

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yes, because I was hot

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
And because I didn't want to comb my hair anymore

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
It gets to the point where it's like, okay, I can't do anything with this

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
So I'm gonna have to shave it off

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Alright, we're about to get into how is your gaming week

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
But first, just a quick little note about tonight's show

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
There's no Justin TV tonight because our video camera's out

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
So we do not have Justin TV feed tonight

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Sorry guys, but at least it's a radio show, not a video show

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
And the other thing is that there's only going to be a part A this week

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
There's not going to be a part A and part B

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
That's partially due to the heat, also partially due to the fact that E3

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
The madness for E3 starts tomorrow

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
So it kind of defeats the purpose of uploading a show mid-week

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Because everything will be outdated

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
We're going to try and have something up on the feed mid-week

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
It just depends if we can all get together at once

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
We'll see, so more to come on that

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
But for now, we're only going to have one big show for you guys here

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
But all the segments you know and love

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Classic gaming of the week, mailbag, all that good stuff

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
And your calls

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
And chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
And tonight, they're talking about fire

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Act Def says the show is on fire

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Frisbee says my hair is on fire

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
There you have it, everybody's on fire

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
You're all flaming tonight in chat at Orange Lounge Radio

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I think I've made a decision

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
What's that?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
What might best suit our needs

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
The cooler?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
A swamp cooler

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Excellent, yeah, actually my work

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
And it's cheaper than a portable air conditioning unit

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Alright

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Be more cost effective

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
This is economics on Orange Lounge Radio

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Save money, use less energy

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Alright, let's talk about all the money you blew games on this week

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
And how was your gaming week?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I played DDR

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Really?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
I played the supernova machine at the movie theater

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
And I wanted to die

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
I was wearing my sandals

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
So first of all I didn't have the right shoes

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
And then I tried to do shit that was way too hard

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
But at least you got up there and played

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, sorta

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I know if I play I am way, way out of practice

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
So that's my issue

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Although I want to try a supernova 2 machine someday

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
I dusted off my Super Nintendo cartridge

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Of something that I will be speaking of later in the show

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Awesome

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
How about now, you are an iPhone user

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Yes, I did download some iPhone games

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
You got the new 2.0 firmware for your existing iPhone, right?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yes, I did

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Okay, gotcha

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And let me give the name of the game real quick

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I haven't played a whole lot of it

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
But it's a free game for everyone who has an iPhone or an iPod touch

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
And it's called Aurora Faint

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
It basically plays like Bejeweled

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
But you have a leveling system in it

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
So it's pretty cool

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Like Puzzle Quest-ish, kinda?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Mmm, yeah

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I also downloaded the Stalker program

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
What, pray tell, is the Stalker program?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Whirl

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
How does that work?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
It's like, for everyone who's got it

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
It keeps track of like restaurants and places you like to go

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
So that you know where your friends like to hang out

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
That is kinda scary

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
What a world we're living in

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
What do you think, though, about this whole, you know, application thing on the new iPhone?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
You know, the fact that people can create their own games and applications and all this stuff

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
God damn time

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
You think it's kinda what's gonna put the iPhone really out there, but make it kinda the must-have thing?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Sorta

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
There's still a lot of people

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
It was already the must-have thing

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
There's still a lot of people that are very anti-iPhone

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Well, sucks to be them

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I think we have one sitting here in the studio

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Sucks to be them, more for me

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm anti-Apple, but that, you know, does fall under the same umbrella

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
Do you think, though, do you think another company will try to, you know, cause I notice like, what is that other phone?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
The Instinct is supposed to work a lot like the iPhone

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I can tell you now the LG one is shit

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
I look at that and I go, it's not gonna really be able to penetrate the marketplace the way that Apple has, I don't think

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
That's just my personal thought

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
What's gonna help Apple is marketing to other providers

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I'll tell you what else is cool

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I was hearing a little bit about it on Bobby's show

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I don't know much about this, but apparently there's some type of program you can get

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
Some app you can get that you can listen to internet radio through that Edge network

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
So you can listen to All Games Radio or our show anywhere you go

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
People have it hooked up so that if you have one of those systems where you can play your iPod through the car

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
You could listen to All Games Radio, like it's a car

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I almost downloaded it, but I have to move off my photos before I put more apps on there

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
The stuff that I downloaded so far, let me grab my phone and take a look real quick

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Blah

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Live radio, she's literally opening up the phone

06:01.000 --> 06:09.000
I downloaded AIM, Aurora, Thaint, Twitterrific, Whirl, and Epocrates prescription

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Because Epocrates is actually kind of a cool little program

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
That if you have, say that you find an unidentified pill and you want to know what it is

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Then you can enter in the pill's description including serial numbers that are on the pill

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Wow

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
And it'll look it up and show you a picture of it so you can compare it

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
And you know, if I take this, will I hallucinate?

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Bobby spoke up in chat, he says it's called Tuner, is the name of the program you're going to want to check out

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I think I'll download it right now

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Awesome, it might have a cost, I'm not sure

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Let's see, comments from chat

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Robert M, my iTunes is showing the applications menu in place of games

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I have the iPod fifth generation video though

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Same thing happened to me, I have Pagle and some of the other games they've released for iPod

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And they now are applications that run on your iPod

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
And sadly they don't have a lot of them, but that's what happened to the old games

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I hope they do put out some other useful things for those of us that haven't gotten on board the iPhone thing yet

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
I think I will at some point, I'm just waiting for the craziness around the iPhone to die down

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Gerardo speaks up though and says I don't see anything innovative in my phone and then hides

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Okay, I checked out Tuner and Tuner is $5

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
$4.99 to be specific

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Whatever, it's $5

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
So I'm gonna get it after I have money

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I downloaded a bunch of free shit though and it was really cool

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Now I can look up drugs at work

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And AIM, I can use AIM at work

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Free is awesome

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Hells yeah

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Unless it's yours

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
It was full of hamburger

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Oh, because I'm eating a hamburger, that's why

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Of course

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
That is not just a hamburger, that is a bacon and cheese I see in there

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Double bacon cheeseburger

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Oh my god, an artery killer right there

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
Well it's because, I don't know, fast food hamburgers are pretty tiny

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
So if you get a hamburger it's like a cracker

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Gotcha

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
So this is two crackers and, I don't know, bacon

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
By the way Jamie, Bobby is recommending Tap Tap Revenge and says it's free

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I saw it and I looked at it but I don't think I would play it that much

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Free Jamie, free

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Well if it's free then you gotta play it

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Like Yaris, you gotta try Yaris at least once

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
I also though I'm trying to be conservative for space because I really do like to take a lot of useless pictures with my phone

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
That she does, I can attest to that

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
We'll go out to Indian Food and she takes pictures of the food

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
And my beer

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
She takes pictures of his eating, her beer

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Anyway, sorry, Loki, your gaming week

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
That's right

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Grand Theft Auto IV, that was pretty much it

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
I've been busy and we'll get into that

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
We'll get into that in a little while

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
But Grand Theft Auto is still fun, still a lot of people playing it

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
It's still fun, well I haven't, we've just been playing the work games

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
You know, so we do our four player deathmatch because the fifth machine is still broken

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
What makes the replayability of that game so awesome?

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Just, well like the new thing that we're doing now is we've changed the settings a little bit

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
So that the only blip that shows up on the radar is whoever is in first

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And everyone else is invisible

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
So you're running around and whoever is in the lead, you can find them but the other players you can't find

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
So the person in the lead doesn't see like people like bearing down on them in cars and stuff like that

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
So it makes it really intense actually because everyone is kind of going after the leader at the same time

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Nice

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Comments from Chatroom, we have NameAndLights says I'm using Tuner on iTouch

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
So that's that iPod that's not quite, it's the iPhone without the phone

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
The iTouch which also got the upgrade to use all the apps

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
That's pretty cool

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Let's see, other comments from Chat

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Shaoran said there used to be a double bacon with a really long name that a friend of mine called a Satanburger

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I don't know

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
We're turning into Orange Launch Foodio

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Alright, so Grand Theft Auto 4 was Loki's game of the week

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah, pretty much

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
We'll get to the rest of it in a little bit

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Myself, I also have not been playing a lot of new stuff, kind of the same old stuff, you know, Raiding and WoW

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Guitar Hero 2, I went back and played Guitar Hero 2 this week in Guitar Hero 3

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And I think I talked about this a couple of weeks ago

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm finally learning with my fingers how to hit those notes without necessarily strumming

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Like the difference between the notes that you don't have to strum if you get the note before it

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I can't remember what exactly they call that, I'm sure somebody in chat will correct me, but the whole

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Hammer ons

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Is that a hammer ons? Yeah, I'm finally learning how to do that

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
I don't know that either

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Hell, I'm still playing three keys, okay?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Well, I was able to go back to Guitar Hero 2 and 3

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I actually beat the Living Color song in Guitar Hero 3

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I five started my first cult of personality

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
I five started my first time on hard, not expert, I'm not quite there yet

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
But for me, that was a freaking accomplishment

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I was so excited because that song was not easy

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
I was excited when I beat that freaking Slipknot song

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
That has the impossible introduction, that was tough

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
You have to learn hammer ons to get past that

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
I was going to say, I also, this week, it's not gaming related

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
But I kept, just even watching the trailers for it

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And then after watching the movie, I think it would make an awesome game

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Wanted

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Just because, I mean, you know the whole curving bullets thing in there

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
The way they kind of like swing their gun out or whatever

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
You could totally do that with a Wii remote or something

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
I don't understand why anyone hasn't come up with this idea

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
To make this movie into a game

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Because it would be pretty awesome

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
But The Matrix was supposed to be an awesome game too

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Listen, okay

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
After watching this movie, you're just like

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Why the fuck did this guy not direct The Matrix?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Because, I swear to God, if he directed the sequels

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
We wouldn't have an issue

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
There would be like 50 sequels to this damn movie

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Because it's seriously so much better

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It's the Russian guy who did Nightwatch and Daywatch

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
I know, I used to hold The Matrix pretty high up there for action

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
It's borderline, I mean, Keanu Reeves kind of brings it down there

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
But action-wise it was pretty kick-ass

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
But, oh my God, Wanted is so much better

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Sub-Z in chat says, curved bullet is so unrealistic

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
But that's the point, right?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
It's the point

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
You don't go in there expecting a realistic espionage film

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Exactly, I mean, there's a guy that freakin'

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Basically these assassins or whatever

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Have the ability to control adrenaline really well

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
To the point where they can do superhuman things

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
That's the whole premise of this

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It's a superhero film

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Sort of, it's not really that superhuman

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
But Matrix stuff, where they can slow down time

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Their perspective of it, super strength and stuff like that

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Here's my other quick questions about Wanted

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
And then we'll go back to games from movies

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Are there tits in the movie?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
No

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
No tits?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
No tits

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Any drug usage?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
There's lots of blood, lots of killing

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So it's just fine, because I'm looking for the trifecta of sex, drugs, and violence

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
There's no tits, so you don't have sex

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
There's no drugs, it sounds like?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
There's a good twist in the plot, a good twist

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
That you don't see coming

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
It's a twist

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
What a twist

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
You can have Nookie without boobs, Rob

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Well, I guess that's true

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
But, you know, still

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Do you watch that episode of Buffy?

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Look, I'm surprised Angelina Jolie is in a movie and not showing her tits

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
That's all

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Well, you see her entire backside

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Okay, so there's a little sex, a little sex

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Sexual

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Anyway

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
We have T and A minus T

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Just A

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Alright

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
And yeah, it's supposed to be unrealistic, but it's not

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It's basically, it's kind of like The Matrix

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Where it's sort of grounded in

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Okay, I want to say it's really grounded in the real world

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
But it takes place in a world that could sort of be realistic

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
And then there's people doing unrealistic things in it

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
It's sort of like that, but it's not like as ridiculous and ridiculous as

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
But, I mean, a lot of video games are ridiculous

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Like that, right?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
You know, they take place in sometimes the real world

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Or a world like this one

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
It's not like you go into it and go

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Man, this is completely retarded, like the transporter or something like that

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
This is, you know

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
I don't know, it's just really cool stuff

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
That's all I got to say

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Awesome

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Definitely go see it, it's awesome

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
I'd totally watch it again

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Back to video games, I want to talk about a new game I played this week

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I went out and bought Civilization Revolution

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I talked about the demo a few weeks ago on the show

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And I was pretty crazy about the demo

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I went about the full game, I'm not disappointed

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
As a Civilization fan on the PC, I am not disappointed

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
It's not as in-depth as the version on the PC

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
It's very much simplified

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
But I think it works great for a console

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I mean, I ran through a full game

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Granted on the easiest difficulty

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Because I'm still trying to get my feet wet with how to play the game again

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
But it only took me between an hour and an hour and a half

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
To get a total domination victory over my opponents in the game

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
The only kind of little bitch I have in the game that I think would get to me

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
If I was coming from the PC to the console

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
And I think you've probably heard this a lot of other places and it's true

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
You don't get to customize your game a lot

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Like in Civ 4, you can customize the world you're playing on

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
And when you start and how the world looks and the size

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
You can customize all that stuff in advance

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
In Civ Revolution, you already kind of start with one city built

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
And that's it, you don't get to customize a whole lot of that

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
So I'm hoping though maybe with some download stuff later on

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
2K and Firaxis can remedy that

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
But it's a minor bitch in the scope of things

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Because I think the game is still pretty cool

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I'm a little surprised it's not on the arcade

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
There's not a lot that they're doing in this game

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
That requires, I would think, the usage of a DVD

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
I would think it's a game they could have put out on the arcade for a lot cheaper

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
So I think the price is probably one of the only sticking points

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Because $60 is quite a bit

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
But it is a hell of a game with replayability value

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
And it's something you can play multiplayer

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Although I personally have not done that myself yet

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I get on and play multiplayer

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I think it's one of those games where it's never quite the same game twice

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And there's many different ways to accomplish the goal

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Many different civilizations you can play

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I do recommend it, especially if you're a fan of it on the PC

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
And you want to kind of check it out

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
But just know you're not getting a port of Civ 4

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
You're getting a whole new Civ-like game

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
That's dumbed down slightly for consoles

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
But sometimes dumbed down can be a good thing

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Yeah, Prowler says in chat there, Simplified can be a good thing

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
And Rama says in chat, Rob is a Civ fanboy, of course he's gonna love it

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Well, yeah

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I don't know if I'd say I love it

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Like I love the original Civilization

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I love Civ 4

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
But I like it a lot

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
So far

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
So we'll see about that

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Again, just to kind of put it out there

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
We are only doing a part A tonight

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
And that has to do with the whole E3

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And things being outdated

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
However, I have some good news

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Now we're not bitter at all about not being able to go to E3

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I mean, no one invited us to the cool kids party

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
We're not bitter at all about not being able to go

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Oh, it's great

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
My work got an invite, but they didn't go

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It's like, oh, we don't want to take it

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
I haven't been interested in going since they changed it

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Although I hear there's no lines in any of that stuff anymore

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I would just want to go to hang out with the cool kids

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
But apparently we are not part of that clique

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
But the hell with them

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
The hell with them

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
We are starting E3 right now

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
We're starting E3 right now

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
E3 begins right now on this very radio show that you are listening to

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
With our very own

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
OLR E3 press conference

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
And you're all invited

16:52.000 --> 17:03.000
Alright, and we have our own E3 surprises in store for you tonight

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
So the official OLR E3 press conference

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Blah, blah, blah

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
We've had wonderful support from all of our listeners

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Over the past six years of our existence

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Blah, blah, blah

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Our show is still making no money at all

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
But it's sure fun to listen to and do

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Blah, blah, blah

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Okay, let's get to the good stuff

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
We have three announcements tonight that will change our show a little bit

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
For the future

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Now one of these you have probably heard about a little bit

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
But we're just kind of confirming it on our own program tonight

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
And that is that we are going to PAX

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Penny Arcade Expos

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
If E3 won't have us

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Then F you

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
We're going to go to Penny Arcade Expo

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I think that's funny because isn't that also Latin for peace?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
I'm not sure

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I didn't do research before tonight's press conference

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
But we'll say yes for now

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
But here's the thing

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
It gets better

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Now sadly Loki is not going to PAX because of the wife

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
But you know things happen

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
But myself and Dark Sakura are going to PAX

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
But it gets better

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Not only are we going to PAX

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
We are going to be on the floor

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Actually broadcasting live radio

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
It's a partnership thing that we're doing with All Games Radio

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
They're actually going to be set up there

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Out there on the floor with like bean bags around

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
It's something called the Sumo Lounge

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
I myself have not been to PAX

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I don't know what this is

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
But it's going to be near the tabletop gaming and the press room area

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
They're going to have the Sumo Lounge with bean bags

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
And we're actually going to be broadcasting from the show

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Friday, Saturday, Sunday

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
That's 3 hours on Friday starting at 4 Pacific

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
3 hours on Saturday starting at 4 Pacific

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
And 2 hours on Sunday starting at 4 Pacific as well

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
The whole thing is going to be moderated by Bobby Blackwolf

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Our buddy that precedes us here on Orange Lounge Radio

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
We will be a part of that

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
We'll be kind of on and off of there

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
We might do our own podcast from the site to supplement it

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
But we'll be live as a part of this on All Games Radio

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
It's not just us

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
DMN, your old pal from our network as well as Understation Live

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
He's going to be there

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Bobby's there

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Super happy fun time show

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Dead Pixel Live

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Electric Sisterhood

All there, all represented at Penny Arcade Expo

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
It is the freaking Voltron of independent podcasting

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Live

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
August 29th, 30th, and 31st in Seattle

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And if you can't be there in person you can still listen to the madness on

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
AllGames.com

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It's going to be awesome

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Bobby would like to clarify it is not in the exhibit hall

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
But it's still within the convention center

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
So there it is

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
And the OLR PAX broadcast will also be podcasted

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
Bobby will let you know when our segment is

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
That we're going to be on it

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
And it's apparently going to be its own special podcast

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
So stay tuned to AllGames.com for more information on that

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Second announcement

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
You asked for it, you got it

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
We're going to do it

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
I know that part B has been very delayed lately

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Throughout the week in getting pushed to the podcast feed

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
So we're going to try something new

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Don't say that OLR doesn't listen to the listeners

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Starting with next week's show

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Part A and B will be released as one giant show

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Parts A and B combined into one giant show

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
And we will have something that kind of even runs in between the shows

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
When you're listening to them on the podcast

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It will not be the show itself

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
But probably promos for other shows

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
And other fun things that we want to try doing with the podcast

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Some of these joke ads and things that we were talking about

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
We're going to kind of start to get our feet wet with that

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
So starting next week parts A and B combined in one part

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
So you no longer have to wait until like Friday or Saturday to hear the whole thing

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
You will get to download it Monday at the latest

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Which will be pretty awesome

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Alright

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
And the third announcement

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And my favorite

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Is really awesome

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Loki why don't you tell the listeners a little more about this

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
What you've been working on for the past few weeks

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Yes and unfortunately I wish I could say that I was done but I'm not

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
That's okay because at E3 you sometimes tease things that aren't coming out until Christmas

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
And this should be out a lot sooner than this

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It's not going to be until Christmas

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
I definitely hope that

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I worked my ass off for the last

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Probably about a month on this

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
Anyways yes you finally are going to get an update to OLRPSP.com

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Finally

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
But there's some good stuff coming with that

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
The big part of it is actually going to be

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
The brand new OLRPSP all games radio streamer

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Which is going to be

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Kind of like the radio players that you see on the PSP

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
But definitely a lot cooler than all those

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
In fact

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Hopefully that will be released soon

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
With that will be the OLRPSP flash chat

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
I tried my hardest to get IRC chat but

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
It just wasn't happening

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
And let me reiterate because I saw the draft of what this looks like

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
And you're going to be posting screenshots to Orange Lawns Radio a little later on right

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
This is actually the way it looks in your PSP

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
It is not something you don't even have to go to OLRPSP.com in your browser

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
It looks like an application loaded in there

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Like the other radio station listeners

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
When you click it, it takes you to a live radio feed

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
That is broadcasting all games radio

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
This is the part that Bobby didn't even know about

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
It even is taking that little box with the times of the upcoming shows from the website

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
And showing that as part of the player

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
It is awesome

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
And then other things are going to be included with that

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
There's also going to be

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
All the RSS feeds are going to be in there as well

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
You'll be able to listen to podcasts

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
From all the different shows and stuff

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
You'll be able to select through that stuff

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Details on all the other shows on all games

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
There's a lot of small things I'm working on right now unfortunately

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
IRC chat on the PSP

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
I even tried buying the PSP IRC script

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
And the guy is a douchebag and won't fucking sell it

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Even for a lot of money

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I don't think you're supposed to say douchebag in an E3

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
That's alright

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Breaking new ground here ya douchebags

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Anyways

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And then I'm going to have some more download stuff as well

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I wanted to work on a theme and stuff

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
But it's just

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Seriously I've been in my computer room forever

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I will post some screenshots though into chat

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
So you can see a few screenshots I've taken

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
But it's still a work in progress

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
And I'm hopefully going to have it done very soon

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Alright

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Prowler in chat room says

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
This is already better than last year's Microsoft press conference

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Well thank you

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
We try

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
So any estimated time on when this is going to be out

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Like before the end of the month? August-ish?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I'm hoping before the end of next week

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
But we'll see

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Oh and you've even posted a link of what one of the screenshots looks like to chat

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
That's going to be awesome

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh there's two coming

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
So our live listeners get to see it

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
For those of you listening on the taped podcast

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
You can look at those on our forums quite soon

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Those will be up very soon on our forums

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
OrangeLawnTrader.com click on forums

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Alright

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
That does it again to reiterate our three points

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Of this year's E3 press conference

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
E3 won't have us so the hell with them

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
We're going to PAX and it's going to be even better

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Part A and B will be combined starting next week

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
With the podcast and the OLR PSP.com

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
OLR PSP.com

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
New website and radio tuner application

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
That takes you direct to AllGames.com

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Radio feed coming soon

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah because

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
The PSP sucks

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And it doesn't, you know, unfortunately

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
It takes a fucking long time to

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Put pages on there because

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
You make it in a program for the PC

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
You view it on your PC and it looks nice

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
And you take it to your PSP and it looks like shit

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
So it's a long

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Process

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Well anyhow we are going to

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Shift gears and get into our regular

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Show tonight as if a press conference

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Wasn't enough we have a whole regular show

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
To get to and that is tonight's gaming news

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And Loki once again starting us off with tonight's gaming news

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Alright

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Well this is not

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
A big surprise but Konami has

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Lodged a patent suit against Harmonix

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
And MTV over Rockband

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I mean, I don't know

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
There's definitely I guess some merit to it

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Seeing as it looks very

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Similar to

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Guitar Freaks Drum Mania, the whole setup

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I'm just surprised it took them this long

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
But I mean

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
You know

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Maybe they're not licensing the technology

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Like Guitar Hero is

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
So

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
If that's the case you know I do think Konami

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Is owed some money although it is kind of cheap to do

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
That and then release their game

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Which their game looks like a cheap knock off

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Of Rockband I don't know it's just

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I wish they had done this

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
A lot sooner like put out their game

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Instead of just bitching

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
About the other games coming out

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Katamari's Forever in chat says confusing lawsuit is confusing

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It is kind of in depth

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
What is it that Konami is specifically

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Taking issue the way I understood it

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
It has to do with the controller

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
It's not necessarily so much the game itself

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
But it seems to be the fact that it's a guitar controller

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Very similar to what Guitar Freaks was

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
When it was out here in the US

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
In very small arcade test markets

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
A long time ago

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
That's their point of contention

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah and they do have the patents in place for it

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I mean I'm sure they do because it's been out for

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
You know years now

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
So

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Yeah I mean they're in the right there

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
To defend their patent

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
When Rockband first came out

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I guess now that they figure there's money

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Involved in it and they can make a lot of money off of it

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Then yeah that's

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
They should do it but at the same time

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I kind of wish that they were just leading

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
You know the music gaming industry

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Instead of just trying to follow and just

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Make money off of lawsuits

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Because now their new game

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Which to be honest I don't really care too much about

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And it looks kind of cheap

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
So

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I don't know

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Personally I think it kind of stinks

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Because you know obviously I enjoy Rockband

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
But it's kind of one of those things in the back of my mind

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I kind of always wondered

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
You know if Konami sued those folks that did

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
In the groove I'm kind of surprised

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
They never tried to go after Rockband

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And then especially after hearing that

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Activision's already been paying them under the table

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
For quite some time

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
For the whole Guitar Hero thing

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Red Octane and Konami have had a long relationship

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
And then I kind of thought well maybe part of the reason

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
This took so long to happen is because

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Konami have had somewhat of a long relationship too

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
With the whole karaoke revolution thing

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
But you know the whole timing of this lawsuit is

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Awfully odd

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
With their games coming out this year and everything

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And I think it kind of stinks but at the same time

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I don't know there might be some merit to it

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I just hope it doesn't stop Rockband

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
You know and also I think

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
You know well with that hole in the groove thing come on

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It really was a freaking copy

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Of DDR I mean in the groove was

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Freaking DDR with minds and like a couple

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Innovative things you know

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
We talked about it way past the history of our show

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
About the whole in the groove thing

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I mean we all saw that coming a mile away

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
By the way we called it too

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
We said Konami's going to sue these folks

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
When they try to invade the home market

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
And sure enough when that in the groove game

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Came out for PS2 that's when Konami

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Sicked the Bulldogs on them

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
But it does make this whole thing interesting that Rockband's

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Been out for like a year, year and a half

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I mean does it, well not quite a year and a half

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
But about a year I mean does it take that long for a lawsuit

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
To get rolling? No it's just they want to

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
See how successful it is now that it's

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
You know finally come around and

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
They're going to be putting out their sequel and stuff

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
They want a piece of the money

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Interesting

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
DarkSocker do you have any thoughts on this?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Because I know you twitted some stuff

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Earlier in the week I'm curious kind of where your thought is

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
At this point in time with the whole suit

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I think that it's petty

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
And ridiculous they

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Had their chance when

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
And you know it was funny remember talking to

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Jason Anis all those years ago about

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Trying to bring the money

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Into the US and

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Working on getting Guitar Freaks and everything

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
They had their chance

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
And they had their advocate then

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Did they hop on it? No

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
So someone came along and did it better

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
And you know what I think you're speaking

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
A lot of the same things that the music game

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Community is saying is that there's this

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Round of disappointment in Konami

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Because you know

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
They had all these, this Beatmania

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Series in Japan was awesome

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
The 2DX series awesome

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Guitar Freaks, Drummania, people loved it

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
People were importing that stuff and everybody

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Was asking why aren't you bringing it out here?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
And it took one of their own

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
People on the USA side

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Jason to twist the

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Fucking arm of the Japanese

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Side and we barely got DDR

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
And you barely got DDR and then

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
DDR was a huge success and

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Remember how shitty that first mix

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Of DDR was

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Everyone was happy

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And then it would just cause a landslide to DDR after that

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Look how successful it's been

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
And then Beatmania 2DX the problem was

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
They didn't learn from their mistakes

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
They released a kind of a shoddy 2DX mix

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I mean they took some risks with it

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Which were kind of cool at the whole 5 key thing

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But it just wasn't enough

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
They didn't take enough risks with licensing

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
That's where Guitar Hero and Rock Band

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Whooped them is that they knew what the American

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Audience wanted and they went for it

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
And I'm sorry if this offends you

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Anime folks and J-Pop loving folks

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
That like the Bamani songs

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
That are in the 2DX but all of those

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Songs would never have worked here

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
And that's kind of proven

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
By the 2DX release over here

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
It needed more

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
And that crappy cover of Toxic and

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
One Moby song that wasn't enough

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
It needed like half and half at least

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
It needed more songs that could have reached out to the American audience

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
But anyhow

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
So but my question is

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Despite the

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
The kind of resentment we almost feel towards

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Konami for not taking the freaking risk sooner

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
And now looking almost like a copycat

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
With this whole Rock Revolution thing

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Does it make it right though?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Does it make it still that their lawsuit doesn't have any ground

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
To stand on because as disappointed as I am at

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Konami I still go but

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
They have a point

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I don't know I mean any thoughts

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
On that I mean do you think you still think

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
It's kind of like petty or

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I mean I don't know

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
It's still petty

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
The format I think is so different

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
And so much

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
The other thing it has to be

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Is whether or not they actually did in effect

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Go and re-engineer

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
You know

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
What Konami had done

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
How long was the trademark out

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
For their controllers

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And plus I think Red Octane knew what they were doing

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
When they originally put out Guitar Hero

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
They knew what they were doing

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And that's why there's those under the table payments

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
That's what we're calling it but you know what I mean

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
To um Konami

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
But Harmonic should have known

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
What they were getting into as well

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And I love Harmonic

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
So Harmonic makes some great games

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
That's what kind of makes this disappointing

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
But they kind of should have known that this might happen

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
It's just kind of disappointing

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I don't know

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Going off some comments from chat

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Because I'm sure there's a lot of folks in chat

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Gerardimo says 2DX was based on the assumption

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
That only DDR players had heard of would be playing this

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
That's why just about all the songs on it are in DDR

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Kind of

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
But they really pushed Beatmania at E3

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Like it was their big title but then the title itself

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
By the time it comes out

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I mean god remember that G4 clip

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Where they were calling it a Guitar Hero knockoff

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And all the beat uh

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Bamani fanboys were getting angry

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Remember that

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
And then some talk as well in chat about the whole MTV Drumscape thing

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Shouldn't MTV already have some type of patents on drums

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Because of Drumscape

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Well even if they have patents on drums they may not have patents on guitar

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
And I think that's Konami's issue

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I don't think Konami was doing anything about the drums

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I don't know

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Technically Konami could be sued by the creators of uh

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Several of the MIDI guitars too

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Or Gibson

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Well yeah but

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Well Konami's guitars when they first came out

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
They didn't really resemble any type of real

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You know form of guitar

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It was fairly

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I'd say an innocent design

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
If you know what I mean

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
But um

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Obviously the MIDI guitars

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Especially ones that have worked on Switch like that

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Have existed for you know

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Since the 80's at least

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Um Game Guru in chat says

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
If Immersion could win against Sony

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Konami can win against EA

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
And I think that's what it's gonna be settled out of court

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
One way or another I think

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I think that's what's gonna happen

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Hopefully it doesn't prevent Rock Band 2 or delay it any further

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I don't think it will

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Yeah I don't think it will either I think it'll settle out of court

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I think uh they're gonna have to make those payments

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
But the problem is Konami

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Their game that they're bringing out this winter

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Is gonna have to really kick ass

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
And from or they're gonna have that

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
They're gonna look like jerks

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I'm honestly I don't see

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
How they're gonna innovate on this at all

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
The bar is very low right now

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Yeah I mean

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Just looking at their drum set that they have set up

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It looks stupid

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It really does look stupid compared to some of this other stuff that's come out

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
For me it's all about the song list

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I'd be very and you know well

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
You know atmosphere and all that is nice too

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
So I would hope the game is good looking

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
But uh song list is very very important

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Uh Rama says what you all forget

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Is that Rock Revolution focuses more on drums

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Not guitar

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Well that's nice that it focuses on drums

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
But I still think it should focus on everything

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Since you know that's what

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Rock Band is doing

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Including keyboard

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It focuses on everything Rock Band they have you know

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Solid you know vocals

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
They have solid guitars and drums

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
It's not just one or the other

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Alright well um

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
More to come on this as the weeks go by

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I'm sure we'll hear about the settlement very soon

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Or at least some type of further comment from

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Harmonics and Viacom

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And all those people outside of uh

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
This is stupid

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Anyhow speaking of Konami and their music games

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
DDR is still trekking along

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
And Dance Dance Revolution X

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Is the new game that is coming out on the Playstation

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
2 or later this year

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And you know there's more DDR games coming out for the home consoles

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
But what might have surprised some people

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
This is also going to be an arcade port

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Dance Dance Revolution X will be coming

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
To the arcades and

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
It is a whole new cabinet

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It looks like it's actually something on a widescreen monitor

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Um there's some pictures that have been posted

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Over at uh bombanistyle.com

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Which I believe came from that

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
ZenSI Vanisher site

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Of an actual new cabinet and what it looks like

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Some of the names have been changed like

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Beginner mode is starter mode, advanced mode, course mode

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
There's now shock arrows

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
In the game which is basically mines

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Although I seem to recall DDR

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Has had poison arrows before

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It was in one of the Ultramix games, go back and look

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Um there's also going to be the

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Link feature, USB

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Cards will now handle edit data

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
So yeah

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Edit data is coming back to the DDR series

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Thanks to a USB memory cord

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
And apparently good edit data

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Is going to go worldwide on eAmusement

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
That's pretty cool

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
The most commonly played stuff will be back in the game

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Older songs possibly making a comeback

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
60 plus new songs

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Including licenses and new originals

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
And uh developers

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Say that they are committed to putting

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
1.5 times the amount of new content

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Content in future mixes

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
And another thing I believe I was hearing about this

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Betzen is now not involved in this

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
They were doing the cabinets for Supernova

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Apparently they are not involved in this any longer

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
That could be part of the reason

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I'm not sure though about all the changes

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
More information to come when these machines

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Start being spotted out there in the wild

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
But uh Konami is still trying to do stuff

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
With their DDR series

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Definitely and somewhat

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
You know at least

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
At least one of those tracks

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Is probably going to be pretty good

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And now there's folks saying that the poison arrows

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Thing is taken from in the group

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
But correct me if I'm wrong

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
In one of the early early DDR games

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Like second mix or some crap

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Wasn't there like a mode where there were arrows

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
That you weren't supposed to step on

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I thought in one of the early earlier DDR mixes

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
There was something like that

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I don't know

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I think maybe like challenge mode or something like that

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Well there was also the one where you weren't supposed to step on

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Any arrows that weren't currently up on the screen

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
But oh well

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I don't think it's anything that surprising

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Honestly and anyway

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I didn't really call to mind things that much

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Innovation in the first place

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
You know sure it was something new

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
But it didn't exactly reinvent the game

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
So I don't think it's that big a deal

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And he's kind of putting it in this new game

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I kind of think they're a little dumb anyway

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I hope they don't overuse them

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
But we'll see

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
So coming to arcade soon

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Well something

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
That makes me happy in particular

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
And this makes me uber happy

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Is that

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
There is going to be

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Another Sega Aegis PS2

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Release

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
That is the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Which was

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I do think

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Fantasy Zone 2 DX

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Before

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
But hey it's more Fantasy Zone

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
And I hope it's actually done up like the

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
The Sega Aegis

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
One that I already have on PS2

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
That was part of the Sega Aegis

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
2500 set

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Which was named that because it was

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
2500 yen

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
But this is supposed to be

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
From what this says on here

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Fantasy Zone Gear, Super Fantasy Zone

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Oppa Oppa Galactic Protector

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Fantasy Zone 2 Remake

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
And the Sega Aegis 2500 Volume 3

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Fantasy Zone version

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Sounds like a lot of Fantasy Zone

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Get ready! Sounds like Do You Want

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Because I think I actually have most of these

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I wonder if Oppa Oppa was

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Fantasy Zone 3 The Maze

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Especially if there's some updated graphics

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
And sound and all that's usually a good thing

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I want an Oppa Oppa

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
A little plushy or something?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I know, I do want one

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Well who knows, maybe they'll be showing this

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Maybe I should cosplay the Oppa Oppa one year

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Maybe they'll show this to Tokyo Game Show or something

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
A little more in it, we'll see

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I told you this story, Rob, but one time I was trying to look for the Oppa Oppa music

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I ended up downloading a

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Happy song in Greek

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It's called Oppa Oppa

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Because that means like, yay

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Interesting

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I'm sure it was a better song than Caramel Dancin

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I'm sure that's for sure

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Fantasy Zone is still a ways out

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
But we have some stuff coming out

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
A lot sooner than that, right Loki?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Yes, this week there's some

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Pretty interesting stuff coming out actually

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Especially if you like football

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
There's NCAA Football 09

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And that's coming out on

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Xbox 360, Wii, and the PSP

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
And also there is a game based off the

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Looks like crap movie

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
But Space Chimps

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
That will be out on PC, PlayStation 2

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
The Wii

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
And I believe the

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
360 and DS

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Also

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Hunting Unlimited, 2009

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Coming to the PC

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
That looks like shit as well

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Code Lyoko, Quest for Infinity

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
On PSP

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Nancy Drew, The Clue Bender

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Society on the DS

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
For those who may have Rock Band

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
On PlayStation 2 or Wii

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
You'll get your Rock Band Track Pack

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Volume 1 this week

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Which has 30 songs you can play

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
And that's

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Let's see here

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
And

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I think that's about it

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Trying to keep it I guess a little bit light

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Next week though, or the week after

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Next is actually going to be pretty nice with Final Fantasy 4

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I would imagine

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
There's going to be some surprises

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
With the whole E3 thing

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
At least as far as downloadable stuff goes

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Oh yeah, most definitely

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
In fact I was just pulling up some last minute

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Story things and I've already seen

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Two more speculated Xbox Live arcade games

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
That are going to be in there

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
If all the ruined ones come out

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
There will be like four different games coming out next week

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
We'll see what happens

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Hey traveling over to Japan, it's a little bit of a light week

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
For you guys over there too

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Probably for the same reasons as light over here

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Dark Messiah Might and Magic Elements

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
July 17th coming from Ubisoft

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Coming out on other systems

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Such as the Playstation 3, Metal Gear Online

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Makes its way so

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
That could also be a reason why it's a slow week otherwise

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Because that's definitely an anticipated title

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
That is coming out for only 20 bucks

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
So check that out on the Playstation 3

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Also coming out on the Playstation 3

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Tears to Tiara

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Kaka no Daichi

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
That is a game coming from Aqua Plus

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
And it not only comes out in Japan

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
But all Asia regions on the Playstation 3

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Boom Blocks gets its Japanese release this week

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
That's a game I have

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
That I still need to play

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I bought it and I haven't even played it yet

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Because I got a big discount on it

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Because I have friends in low places

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
On the Playstation 2, Shining Force EXA

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
And Shining Wind get price reductions into the best series

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
But if you want to check out something new

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
You can check out Poi Hito Natsu no Kaiken

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
That comes out in regular and limited edition formats

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
From Idea Factory

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And taking a look at the handhelds

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
There is a ton of stuff coming out

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Including

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Dragon Quest 5

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
And I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be all over that one

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
And there's even like matching cases

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And protectors to match that

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
It's going to be pretty awesome

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
The game Exit gets a DS port as well

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
That's actually in Korea however

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Also

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You know I got to get this, Hello Kitty

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
No Panda Sports Stadium comes out

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
On the DS as well as Metal Slug 7

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Comes out this week in Japan

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
And with the Hello Kitty game

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Some new Hello Kitty pouches

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
In pink and white so you can carry

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Your game and style

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
And if that doesn't work for you

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
How about the Sugar Bunnies pouch

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
That comes out in blue and pink

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
It's a very girly week in the Nintendo DS world

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
But hey at least you have Metal Gear on Playstation 3

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
To counteract that

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
And on the PSP

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
There's some stuff over there too

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Gundam Battle Universe makes its way out to the PSP

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
And if that's not your style

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Hime Hibe Princess Days Portable is more

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Up your alley coming out on

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
July 17th on the PSP

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
That's your Japanese release date

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I was mesmerized

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I know, awesome

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I have four games

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
That are going to be out in the next week

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And I'm going to go ahead and name one for next Sunday too

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Just because by the time I

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Say anything on that day it'd be too late

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
So given that it'll be the next day already

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
So for

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
The UK we have three games

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
On the 18th we have, well actually two

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Different systems

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Baroque on PS2 and Wii

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
And Guitar Hero on Tour on

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
DS which is not all that fun

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Sorry

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Spoiler!

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And then on the 20th CID 925

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
An Ordinary Life on PSP

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Small week for Europe, sadly

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Very small

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
But also I think our Europe releases they really only cover the big

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Big stuff and not a lot of the little

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Stuff like we have over in Japan

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
This list we use has everything

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
On it, not

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Not necessarily all AAA titles

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
How about Virtual Console over in the

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
UK? We do have some fun

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
For the Virtual Console

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
The first one

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Sorry I love the description

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
That Eurogamer gives it

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I'm going to quote

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
The first of these is Ninja Commando

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
A top down vertically scrolling shooter

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
That has ninja and commandos and time travel

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
It also has a rubbish but very funny English translation

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
That's the best description ever

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I cracked up when I saw it

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Ninjas, commandos, what else do you need?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Time travel!

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Now what else do you need? That's it

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
A rubbish English translation

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Perfect, everything I want in a game

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Make your time

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Art of Fighting 2 is

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Another one which is just a

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Fighting game but it

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Had

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Tons of jokes for Capcom came from that

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Do you know the Art of Fighting?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
And it's

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
The game series that also spawned us are

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Dan Hibiki

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
It has a fighter named after me, that's all I need

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Robert

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Hello

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
You should cosplay him

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
No thank you

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Anyway, the Neo Geo games are going to be

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
900 Wii points

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Translating to 9 euros

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Or 6 pounds 30

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
So go get them

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
That's an order

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
After E3 you should probably have some more fun

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Yep

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Now I'm sure this came to a big surprise to everybody

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
This morning but

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Microsoft has confirmed that guess what

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
The Xbox 360 20 gig

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Pro system

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Has dropped in price to $299

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I am so surprised

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
That is a big shocker

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
And also surprising and completely not already leaked

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Already

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
That there will be introducing a new

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Big console that's going to be

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Arriving early August

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
That will be the current $349

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
So they're not really dropping

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
The price, they're just kind of

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Upgrading for the same price

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
So at the press conference tomorrow you guys

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Act surprised

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Just act surprised

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Exactly

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Especially when they mention the avatars

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
And stuff, pretend that you didn't hear it already

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Or that you didn't hear about

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Some of the lips rumors leaking out

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
There on the internet

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
We have never heard of this game called Lips

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
That apparently is under development

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
But here's the thing

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Variety magazine which is a magazine

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Really for the industry of entertainment

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
It covers mostly movies, television, music

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
That stuff, but it does dabble in gaming

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
And it talked in a recent article

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
About the Lips project

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
So hello, if that wasn't confirmation

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
What do you need

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
It is going to be at E3

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Apparently some of the box art has leaked out

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I wouldn't say that, but the wireless microphones

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Have apparently leaked out as well

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
So that's pretty cool that they're wireless microphones

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
But get this, I love this

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
The microphones apparently have lights in them

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
At the base of the microphone have these

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Colored lights that are supposedly

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I guess they're two rings of

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Light that are blue or red

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
And apparently the way you sing

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Controls the lights

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
So I guess it's one of those things

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Where maybe it's red most of the time

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
I think the blue or red are just to indicate

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Which player it is

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Because they have the same kind of thing

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
On SingStar

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
What's interesting, and you may not remember that

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
From the leaked survey that was out there

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
But they're supposed to be motion sensitive

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Those microphones

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
And they allow you to

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
In the game you're supposed to be singing and dancing

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
And it's supposed to pick up the movement

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Oh god

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Get ready to look like an ass in your living room

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I'll pitch you anything

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
That little camera works with the game too

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Well I hope it works with something

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Because you know

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I paid good money for that camera

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Exactly, and now we hardly ever get to use it

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
But no, this game does sound cool already

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I'm very curious to see

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
What the actual game itself

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Because even though we've seen the box art, we've seen the mics

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
We've seen the concept, we know it's probably

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Most likely being developed by the Elite Beat agents

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Folks, we have yet to see screens

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
But tomorrow at E3 we should get some screens

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I'm gonna take a wild guess here

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
And call me a psychic

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
But I'm gonna guess that they're gonna look

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Something very similar to

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Sing Star, Karaoke Revolution

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Rock Band

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
And probably Guitar Hero World Tour

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
It would be rad though if it was something

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Kinda different, you never know

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Except it probably won't be

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
It probably won't

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Stop it Debbie Downer

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Raining on my parade

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Gerardimo says if you sing badly, do you get a light show?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
That'd be kinda cool

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Why should you get a

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Why do you deserve a light show if you suck?

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I don't know, maybe it's

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Consolation Prize, who knows

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
But Lips, that's one of the titles

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I can't wait to hear about at Microsoft Press Conference

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Well

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
You'll have to wait, I'm sorry Rob

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I know, but it's being

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
It's being streamed online like everywhere

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
And it's supposed to be on TV and all this stuff

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I'm gonna watch it during work tomorrow

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Sadly I have to teach tomorrow

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
So I can't watch the conference during work

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I'm gonna be refreshing some of the gaming blogs

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
On my break to see what's announced

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Well how is this for some happy information

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Mega Man 9

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Is actually

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
They said it was gonna be

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
WiiWare coming onto Xbox Live Arcade

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
And PlayStation Network

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
That's gonna be kinda weird

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Playing a Nintendo style game on Xbox Live

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
But that's cool

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Now I don't have to worry about storage issues

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
On my Wii, hooray

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It could be some sort of HD version though

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
It sucks for you

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
It sucks for you Nintendo cause I was gonna buy that game

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
And now I'm not

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
But for anyone who's gonna get it on Wii

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
It's gonna be about 10 bucks and there is a trailer floating around

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
So go find it

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I did watch the trailer for the game and it lets you see

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
What some of the boss monsters look like

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Cause you see little silhouettes of them

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I wonder if this thing looks like a mantis

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Splash Woman for the record looks like

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Kind of a mermaid-ish looking thing

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
More like a naga, she looks like Lady Vash

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Actually

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Warcraft joke, but I'm serious

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
That's what she kinda looked like in the trailer

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Like one of those Poseidon ladies

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
And some of the other robots are kinda cool too

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
You can only see their silhouettes

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
But I am all kinds of excited about Mega Man 9

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I would be more excited if they come out at E3 and say

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
It's available now

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
But I doubt it seeing as we've already heard rumors

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Of a September release date

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Still, that's not that far off

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Something else that's not very far off too

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Is a rumored

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Silver DS system

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Which will be coming out in the US

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Now

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
The story actually is coming from

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Go Nintendo

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
They have a source that says

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
That the

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
I guess the DS that was with

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Guitar Hero

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
That bundle that came out

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Is gonna be hitting stores

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I don't know what they're talking about

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I mean that's totally news to me

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Yeah

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
I would be very surprised

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
If we saw it like in September or something

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
And it was actually the silver and black DS

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
That was with the Guitar Hero bundle

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
That would be really surprising

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Wouldn't that be neat?

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
That would be neat. Surprising.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Completely surprised.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Just as surprising as Microsoft's price

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Conference will be tomorrow.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
But folks do really need more colors for the DS

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
I mean seriously.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I guess they're still selling

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
What about Wii colors?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
You think Nintendo's gonna give us some Wii colors finally?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Not that I'd go buy a new Wii

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Just because it's a different color

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
They won't change the color of the Wii

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Until it starts dropping in sales or

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Flattening out

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
If they release a pink Wii

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I would actually consider it for a little bit

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Maybe I could find a good place

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
A good home for my current white, boring Wii

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Who knows. Speaking of rumors

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
It's something that's definitely all around this week

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And kinda interesting

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Apparently Duke Nukem 3D

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Xbox Live Arcade screenshots

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Are floating around out there

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I guess this is being shown

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Or this is being lifted off of that whole

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
What do they call that? Partner net?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
The game costs

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Supposedly 1,337

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Microsoft points, which I'm sure is a joke

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Same for the trial though too

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Actually gonna charge that, yeah

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
But it also kinda makes you go

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Hmm, could it be a photoshop?

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
It could be a photoshop

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
But what's interesting about it is that apparently

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Some achievements have also leaked for the game

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
The world looks like a cleanup on aisle 4

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Is the achievement

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
And to get that

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
You have to step in a pile of poop

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I wish I was joking

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
But that is really the achievement

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
And the picture of the achievement

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Looks like a pile of poop

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Which makes me think

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
This is even more of a fake, but you never know

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
They had poop in the game

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Yeah I know, but if these screenshots

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Are fake, it's a damn good fake

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I'll give them that

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
But we'll find out

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I'm sure tomorrow

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Would you think that this might be

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
One of their games, like they did this with Doom

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Didn't they? Then they come out at some European

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
We can't have 5 Xbox Live arcade games

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Coming out tomorrow, or next week

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Sure we could

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I would like that, but we can't

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I think we all would

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Especially something like Duke Nukem

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Dude, if Duke Nukem comes out on the Xbox 360

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I am buying that game day one

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
I am fucking there

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
I really hope it's not one of those things

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Where I buy it and then I go

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
This was so much cooler when I was 12

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Like Doom was

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Doom, I never really played much of Doom

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Duke Nukem was awesome

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
I played that for hours

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
We're so playing some Duke Nukem when this comes out

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Loki, I hope it's not a fake

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
And if it is a fake

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Whoever faked it, I hope you burn in hell

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
For getting my hopes up

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I hope you step in many piles of poop

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
For the rest of your life

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
And the Middle Eastern curse that applies

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Yes, and poop

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
In your genitals

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Haha, poop in your genitals

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
This show is rated T for trashy

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
For all the toilet humor

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
It's rated P for poo-poo

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Speaking of poo-poo

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Hey

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
No, I wasn't talking about you

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I was talking about someone else

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
That thankfully doesn't come on this program

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
The king of poopy headedness

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Which would be

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
He who shall not be named

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I'll have you know

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
And this is just a funny little bit of trivia

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
That chat room that I put together

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
For the PSP site

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
The only bad word filter that's on there

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Is Jack Thompson

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
And it will actually change it to

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Lord Voldemort for you

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Well done, Loki, well done

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Alright, so yes, what is the latest in

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
your world?

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Well, the judge

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Who is

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I think is in charge of the trial

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Dava Tunis, I guess is the name

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Has referred to

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
He who shall not be named

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
As mentally impaired

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
And

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
A raving wild

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
woman

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Wait, a raving wild woman?

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
No, Nick Thompson referred to her as that

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I'm sorry, I gotcha

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
He referred to her as mentally impaired and a raving wild woman

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
My bad

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I wish a judge would refer to him as a raving wild woman

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
You crazy bitch, sit down

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Well, the judge

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Has recommended that Tom

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
That dude be assessed

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
$43,675

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Fine for legal

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Costs incurred by the Florida bar

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
And he has been found guilty

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Of 27 of 31 charges

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
In a misconduct

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Suit and

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
The judge wants him disbarred

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I love that they have it figured out

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Down to the dollar

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
You know what would make that even better?

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
If it was figured out down to the cent

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
It is figured out down to the cent, actually

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
On Kotaku, they had the cents

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
It was like

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
$36.35 or something

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
It was 35 cents, I remember that

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Hugs and kisses to the folks who made that happen

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
He should be forced to pay it on site

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
To me?

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
No, to the Florida bar

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Alright, fine

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
But then to me

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
He is just a fucker

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
And you know what

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
As much as this is actually

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Kind of good news in a way

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
That maybe he will finally be forced to go away

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Although I am sure he will troll all the blogs still

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Just hearing that name

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Lord Voldemort inspires fear

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
And anger in me

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
So we will be getting to the FUs of the week soon

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
But there is more, apparently

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I just wanted to read the actual first

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Line on this one

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Because I actually did check on Game Politics

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
It says the Florida bar has recommended disbarment

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
For a period of 10 years

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
This court respectfully declines to follow

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
The bar's recommendation

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
The case involves

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Factual findings of cumulative misconduct

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
A repeated pattern of behavior

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Relentlessly forced upon numerous

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Unconnected individuals

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
A total lack of remorse

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Or even slight acknowledgement of inappropriate conduct

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
So

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
So

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
The bottom two things

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I will go ahead and skip to the last paragraph

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Thus after careful consideration

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Of the underlying facts and the

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Instant cases

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Together with the Florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
And applicable aggravating and mitigating factors

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
In the precedent case law

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
This court makes the following recommendations for John Bruce Thompson

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
His middle name is Bruce

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Flees in your pants

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
In your genitals

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
A. Permanent disbarment with no leave to reapply for admission

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
B. Disciplinary costs

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Currently totalling

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
$43,675.35

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Nice

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Currently totalling

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Can we burn on the angst now?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Can we burn on the angst now?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Apparently news about

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Lord of Voldemort makes you gassy

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I was opening my mouth to say something

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And it said I had a juice burp

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Nice

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Multi-part F.U. Number 1

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
The heat returning

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
And

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Number 2

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
To people

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Who think

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
That they have the right

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
To tell someone else

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
What to say or do or think

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Just because they themselves are offended

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
You know what I mean?

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Why don't people learn how to fucking

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Roll with the punches?

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
No

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Not in general

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It's just in general

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
At a point of saturation

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Where I'm just sick with all these people

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Who are like

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I don't like what you did Sue

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Or

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
You said a mean thing about me

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
And Sue

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
And just people who

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Don't know how to get the fuck over themselves

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
And get on with it

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
You know what?

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Since somebody says something shitty about you

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Why should it matter?

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
And also on the same lines

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
F.U. to anyone

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Now I'm going to say fuck you to anyone who tries to tell me

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
How I should talk

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
This is America

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
There's nothing in the Constitution

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
That limits my ability to say

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Fuck, shit, damn, cock or any other

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
So-called curse word that I wish to say

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
In any type of form

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Unless it is specifically said

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
As part of a private organization

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
That these words are not allowed

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
As part of my employment say

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
That's fine

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
But I can stand outside of my place of employment and go

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Fuck!

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
All I want to

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
And it's legal

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
And by the way DarkSakura

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
The lawyers will be calling about the lawsuit with the fleas in my genitals

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
I also plan on

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Cursing in front of my children

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I'll tell you why

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
The Osborn kids came down only slightly fucked up

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I had a discussion about this with my friend

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Who's a parent as well

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
She's not going to have any problem with

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
You know, say if a kid falls and goes

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Oh damn, or shit that hurts

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
She's not going to have a problem with it

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
But have a problem if someone uses it specifically in a

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Derogatory or attacking way

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
So teach someone to be nice

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
You can learn when it's appropriate

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
When it's not appropriate

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
But I'm not going to discourage my children

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
If I ever have any

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
To have to curtail their own freedom of speech

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
For somebody else's comfort

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
I don't have kids yet

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Maybe someday, but I'm still thinking

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Kind of a similar thing because

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
If you don't make it such a bad thing

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Then kids won't want to do it

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
You know, half the reason why I think

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
That a lot of

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Kids act out about stuff or try to be rebellious

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Kids, I'm sorry, they're going to look for something

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
To be rebellious about

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
You say don't cuss, they're just going to start cussing like a sailor

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
That's the truth

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I think that if you set the example

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
That say, well

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
It's not something to get worked up over

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
If we don't care

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Then they're not going to try to do it to get attention

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Just give them the proper attention that they need

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Misty in chat says, see that's another reason

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I don't have an intention of having

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Demon spawn

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I'm actually thinking in the next two years

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Oh my heck

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
That could be something

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Alright, Loki, your F.E. is the week

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And I'm going to probably still be here every Sunday

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
With the baby?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Maybe

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
No, I'm going to make Dan babysit

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Anyway, Loki

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
F.E. is the PSP web browser for sucking

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
That's all I got

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Yeah, mine's short too

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
F.U. to smoke, and I don't mean the fighter

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
In Mortal Kombat 3 or 4 or whatever

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Even though he kind of sucked too

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I'm talking about the smoke that's out there in the air

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Like a fucking volcano blew up in my backyard

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
It's pretty horrible

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And thankfully I don't still live up in Chico

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Where all the fires are happening

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Because I hear up in Chico it's raining ash

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Can you imagine if you walked outside one day and it's raining ash

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
That sucks

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It's like you are actually living in hell

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
For Dante's Peak

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Without

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Or Pompeii the day before

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah, without

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Frickin' what's-her-name-for-the-Terminator

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Being there

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Alright, alright

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Well

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
There's more rumors

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
We have to say this, I'm sorry

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Gulp Banjo in chat says

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Jamie, have the baby live on air

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
It can be an educational thing

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
The miracle of life

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Really?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I've already discussed it

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000
When I do squirt out my own demon spawn

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I'm going to have a midwife and do it at home

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
When the parasite crawls out

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Actually it's funny, my friend

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Becky is so awesome

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
We kept referring to her baby as her symbiote

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Alright, look

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
We've got to get back to gaming

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
We'll have baby chat another time

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
You know the big reason why you don't want to have babies?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
What?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
When you have a baby hanging out around that part of the body

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It shoves the rest of your organs up behind your ribcage

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
That's why moms get heartburn

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's true

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Loki

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Loki, less baby, more game

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Well, these controllers

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You may be able to use it to shove organs of your enemies

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Up into their ribcage

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
But, I don't know

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Anyways, there's a rumor

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
There's still rumors going around that

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Microsoft's going to reveal some sort of motion controllers

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And if that's true

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Then they're thinking that maybe that these

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Motus Games

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Darwin controllers are actually

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
The 360 motion controllers

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Well, there's a few reasons why they may think that

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
One, the controllers kind of fit the color scheme

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
They are white plastic

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And they've got

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Four lights on them indicating that you can use

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Four at one time

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Which kind of makes them a little bit different

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Than say the Wii remote and stuff like that

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
They're kind of

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I don't know

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
You can attach them to each other

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So you can take two of them and break them apart

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Or make them into one giant

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Remote, which is kind of weird

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
But, they have

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Some video kind of showing off

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Because right now these are only for the PC

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Showing them

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Being used like Tiger Woods

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Lego, Star Wars

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Stuff like that

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
So they look pretty cool

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And they work pretty much just like the Wii Remote and Nunchuck

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
But they are wireless, which is nice

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
So you don't have a stupid cord tethering you together

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I don't know

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I guess we'll find out tomorrow

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Or today, depending on when you listen to the podcast

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Alright, stay tuned

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I'm sure we'll be talking a lot about the E3 announcements next week

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Do you think

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Microsoft getting into motion control is a good thing?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I don't know

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I don't know, it would depend on how they did it

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And I'd hopefully

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It would be optional stuff

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Do you think that they would try to release a Wii Sports

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Style game as like their passion game

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Or do you think that would be completely obvious?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I think that would be kind of stupid

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
But, I could see if they did

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Put out motion control or that you would get a lot more

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Of those crappy games on the 360

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Maybe

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Xbox Live Arcade titles and stuff?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
That wouldn't be too bad

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I just worry because they don't really support

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
The camera they put out

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
There's a couple games that use it

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
But that's really it

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
But their whole thing right now

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Is they're trying to get a piece of that

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Casual market that Nintendo seems to have

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Kind of a hold of

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I think what's more interesting

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Is

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
What's Sony gonna do?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
You know, because they want to get into the casual market

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
As well, and we haven't heard too much about

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
What they're gonna do

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And there were rumors a long time ago about new controllers

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And stuff like that

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That they're gonna do something too

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Who knows?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
We'll see

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
In the meantime, we know this game is coming out

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But it's been getting a facelift

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And a lot of people were like

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Cool, that's gonna be awesome

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
When Beer Pong

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Did you hear about this? It was frat party games

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Beer Pong

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
It was gonna be coming out for WiiWare

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Like an actual Beer Pong game

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Who doesn't love Beer Pong at their local frat party?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Apparently, the game was rated T

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So what happened? The game was completely

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Reworked

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It was rated M

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And now they gotta rate it T

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
So all the

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
References to booze were taken out of the game

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And now the game is Pong Toss

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Pong Toss

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Instead of Beer Pong

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
You get Pong Toss, but you know, whatever

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I think either way the game's gonna gotta be hokey

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I mean, if you're gonna play Beer Pong, fuck it, play Beer Pong

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
You don't have to play it on your Wii

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Or if you're 21 and over only, please

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
If you really do wanna play it on your Wii

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Just, there's a game out right now

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Called Game Party

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It's like 20 bucks

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And it sucks

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I mean, I think it sucks compared to everything else

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
So if you really wanna play this, you can probably find that game

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
For dirt cheap

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
So just buy that

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I don't know

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I will

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
We'll see

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
How much is that? This one's supposed to be on the marketplace?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Do we know? Probably like 5 or 10 bucks

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
5, cause, we'll see

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
10 is way too much for that

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Okay, now we're gonna get to the mailbag part of the program

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
This is the part where you can send in your emails

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Every week to mailbagorangelandtrader.com

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And we read them live on air for our amusement

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And to poke fun at you

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
No, just kidding, but if you ask a good question, we'll answer it

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
So let's open up the old mailbag, Dark Sakura

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
See what the listeners have to say

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Wii has letters

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
But only three

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Four, sorry

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Short mailbag

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Well, we got a letter from Rob with two B's

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Yay, Rob with two B's

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
It says, this is mostly for Skye and Loki

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Because DS dropped me already

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I did not drop you

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I'm telling you right now, I did not drop you

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
That's Dan's friends list

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I was using Dan's friends list with him for a while

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
And he has removed people that he does not know

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
So that was not me, it was my husband

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Is this an Xbox Live thing?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Yes

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I did not drop you

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I did not drop you

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I know, it makes it sound like we dropped him

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Like a two dollar hooker, and that's not the case

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Drop the bomb

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
It's not that I want to be dropped

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
But rather that I don't play many online games

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
The only decent but humbling online play

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Was with Rob and friends on Halo 2

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Whenever I play online, I get overwhelmed by radical and social epithets

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So there's little incentive to go online

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
If I ever become a big online game player

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
In a particular game that one of you has

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I may re-request later

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Also my second Xbox 360 died

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So I haven't played anything on it for a while

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
By the way

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I do have my own gamertag

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I don't use it, but as soon as I remember what it is

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I'll let you know

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And I won't delete you

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
On an unrelated note

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Did you try to switch your controller assignment from 1 to 2

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
When fighting Screaming Mantis

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
On Metal Gear Solid 4, hilarity ensues

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I personally didn't enjoy the

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Swap to disc 2 joke

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Because the loading to hard drive screens

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Are more painful than swapping discs

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
What a dang good point

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
What a good point Rob brings up

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Is that, you know, don't joke about the disc swapping

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Thing and the whole, this is blu-ray

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
When the game has a freaking install

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Good point

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And I don't see the need to delete Rob

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
But hey, look, that one game of Halo 2

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Is more than I've played with some people

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And that was fun

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I had no idea

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Blame Dan

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I blame him for everything

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Alright, good job

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
This is from

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Actdeft

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican Actdeft

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
First of all

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I have lots of friendly neighborhood Mexicans actually

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
First of all

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Congrats to your 6th anniversary

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Which I unfortunately missed

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And a belated congrats to Rob for his birthday

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Which I'm getting Rob a present soon

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Thank you

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
A late present

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Second

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Thanks to Rob for remembering me when he

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Interviewed Tommy Tallarico and asking him

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
At Video Games Live we'll return to

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Mexicali

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
That was a pretty good interview by the way

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And it's good to hear he cares for the fans too

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And well I think that's all

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Thanks and ciao

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Yeah it was a long interview but

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
He's definitely

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Passionate and has

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
He's definitely doing a lot for the video game industry

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I was kind of surprised

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You know I kind of thought

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
He was a little more on the

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Hands off journalist reporting end

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
But he does a lot more hands on than you might know

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
At first especially if you're

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Especially if you're basing his opinion of him

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Or if you're basing your opinion of him strictly off of the

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Judgment Day show

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Then you're really missing out, that's one thing I learned

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
This email is sponsored in part by

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Konami, home of Neverending Lawsuits

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
This is Deftest Kebrown

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I see what you did there

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Okay

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Well dun dun dun

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
From Jonathan

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Dear OLR, I have been a long time listener

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And have been tuning into your show for a little

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Over two years now, wow

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
This is my first time writing to you guys

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And oddly enough I am typing this from the

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Wii internet browser since my computer practically

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Died on me

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Wow, emailing from Wii? Impressive

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
My game systems have come in handy during these months

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And I think

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I think it is a blessing that they allow us

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
To do more than just game

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
2 as well as many of your other listeners

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Use my PSP to get my weekly fix

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I don't think that you guys do just one

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Should do just one

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Big show, I mean it could be great

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Having it all at once

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But at the same time as Rob points out

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
We could have spread it out during the week

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
As of late

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I have found the delays

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Of part B to be annoying

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
But I understand that things happen, I'm not fussing at Rob

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
But try to get it in on Thursday

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Or Friday instead of Saturday or Sunday, oh well

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
We've addressed that

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And hopefully, I know he says he likes having it in two parts

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
But I think the whole

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Split thing, Ultra Army and the whole

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Combined thing, we'll try it out

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
If the listeners don't like it, we'll change it back

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Well anyway I guess this should count from my

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Fe of the week, but regarding the limited

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Friends list on Xbox Live, I think

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
That this is total bull

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
People can't be limited to how many friends they can have

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
To game with, and I think that should be

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Part of the next dashboard update

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I should, no

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I know all of your

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I know all about your

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Problem Rob, I am on Loki's friends list

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Though if you need to contact me

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Okay

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Also for any OLR listeners who would like to add me

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
My gamertag is unfoldedraptor

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Jamie I'm sorry if my email

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Is a bit long for such a great show

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
There is so much to be said, oh thank you

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Keep up the great work

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And don't stop believing from Jonathan

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Florida, home of the never ending supply of dying

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Elderly

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Nice

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
That's a little bit horrible

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
But nice

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
The last email is for me

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Dear Jamie, I know I'm a

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Dear

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Thank you so much for choosing Ristar, one of my

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Favorite classic games of all time

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
As the classic game of the week

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I feel bad for not being present that evening

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
But I'm really sorry if I made you angry

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
But being able to listen to it on the podcast

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Was good enough for me

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
And made my day to say the least

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Hi

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Sorry

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
That email reminded me to check something else out

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Yes Rob

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It is a pity that the audio wasn't working

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
So to make up for it and my absence

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I will send a few separate emails with attached

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Zip files that contain all of the great songs

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
From Ristar, including my favorite

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Shooting Ristar and Ring Rink

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Which are songs that

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Play in Act 1 of Planet Florida

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And Act 1 of Planet Freon

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Thanks again Osfer, P.S. you win the world

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Well sadly I'm a little lazy

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
To open up your files and open up the

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Massive MP3's but the good news is

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
That YouTube appears to be working

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Tonight so here's a little bit of

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
What you missed out on last week if I can

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Get a little clip here of the

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Actual gameplay

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
And if you want to hear more about this game go listen to last week's show

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
That it for email?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
That be all

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Alright if you want to email us

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Meanwhile back to the game news

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Yes

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Well

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I don't know what I should really say about this

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It's weird

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And uh

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Alright well anyways

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Nintendo has unveiled a brand new

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I guess

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I don't know if it's a franchise but

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Game called

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Rainbow

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And it's uh

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Sounds awesome

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
It's a really strange looking game

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
It kind of looks a little bit like

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Viewtiful Joe

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
It combines um

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I guess a mix of action exploration

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
And uh

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Manga-esque visuals

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
And what's kind of neat about the whole game

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
At least um

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
What they've said so far is that it's filled

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
With like B characters

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
From different games

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Like for example in the trailer that they had on

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Wiifolder.com

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
You see Birdo in there

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Like talking in Japanese and stuff

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
But it's a bunch of weird characters

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
So uh

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
So wait wait it's a brand new IP that borrows from all the other IPs

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Sort of yeah

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Which is characters they hope you don't remember

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Yeah and the main character is

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
This like dude who turns into Captain Rainbow

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
This

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I don't know

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Rainbow

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
It's weird looking

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And uh I guess

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
He has a yo-yo attack

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Now you know

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
What's more awesome than Captain Rainbow

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Reading

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Rainbow

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I just want to put that out there

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Wouldn't a Reading Rainbow video game be awesome?

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
One of the other characters I guess was in there

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
As well as the golfer from NES Golf

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
That's kind of rare

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Wasn't that just Mario?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Interesting

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Anyhow

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
More franchises

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
This is a good thing though

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
They're not just borrowing from all the other old games

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Capcom is starting a new one as well

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
It's an Xbox Live Arcade game that's coming out

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It's called Flock

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Flock is a flocking puzzle game

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
That is apparently

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
It's got to do with like you're in this grid style thing

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
But you're a UFO

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
And you heard these animals

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And apparently the animals have effects

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
That are affected by

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Certain parts and levels and the puzzle aspects

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Apparently this game is supposed to be

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Kind of like Lemmings

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Over 50 different stages, co-op online play

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And a way to edit your own levels in the game

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Should be pretty neat

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
This is supposed to be their secret project that they were unveiling at E3

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
It doesn't look that cool

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
To be honest

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Here's a little clip

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I know video doesn't work that great over the radio

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
But at least you can hear a little of the music

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Aw it looks cute

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Their little sheath

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
They're hurting everywhere with the UFO

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It looks like a cross between like Kirby Golf

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And Lemmings

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I'll still play the trial if nothing else

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
It might be cool, you never know

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Remember folks, dead raisin wee

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Because they keep saying that's not going to happen

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
But we know better

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
What a flocking interesting announcement

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Alright so

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Yeah, Flock coming soon to

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Xbox Live Arcade

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
That sounds fascinating

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Especially with the little sheep, that was cute

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I like the little cheepy sheep

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Well, some other happy news

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
And it looks like they're not at all I guess that

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Daunted by the lawsuit

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
But EA was planning on releasing

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Two new drum kits for Rock Band 2

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
There will be

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
A

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Velocity sensitive

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Drum pad

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And it won't be as noisy

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And it will have reinforced metal

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Pedals

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And clip on cymbals

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And the second one is actually licensed by

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Ion

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And it's called the Ion Drum Kit

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It's a fairly expensive one

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
But there are electromagnetic cymbals

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And adjustable pads

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And metal frame

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
And it's supposed to be really sweet

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And expensive

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
There are going to be add on cymbals

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
For the Rock Band drums

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Hmm, interesting

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Um, you know

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
If people will pay like 300, 400 bucks

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
For those arcade style Beat Media 2DX

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And Poppin Music controllers though

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Why not pay a lot of money for these Ion

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Super Duper drum sets

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Although I don't know where the F in my house

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I would put them

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Except out here in the garage, for real?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I thought the wife hated the drums

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Well they're at work

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Ah, I see

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Boy, you're a real sucker for those peripherals

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
What about you, Dark Soccer? Speaking of suckers for peripherals

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
You've seen the vault!

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I know, are you going to get these?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Just because I want them doesn't mean I'm going to buy them

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
They're 300 dollars, I mean shit

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
That's expensive

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
For 300 dollars, do you know how many days you could feed

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
A starving child somewhere in the world?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Probably a year

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Yeah, why would I want to feed children?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Why feed children?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Unless they're going to build me a kick ass drum set

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
You could be playing Billy Idol

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
In Rock Band 2

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
It's a nice day for a

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
White wedding

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Anyhow

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
It's a nice day for some more gaming news too

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Alright

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
How many times have we heard this rumor

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
That there's going to be an announcement

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
During the Nintendo conference

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
That's going to unveil

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Animal Crossing Wii

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I know

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I think, are we really going to be shocked if it

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Gets announced?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Yes, because it's like OMG it's finally here

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
The more the shock is

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Is it going to look like

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
It's going to actually be kind of different

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
And more interesting than the DS one

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I'm guessing they're not innovating on shit

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Since they didn't innovate on hardly

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Anything from the DS and

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
GameCube ones

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I wouldn't be surprised

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I'll still buy it because I'm a consumer whore

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Me too

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
The other rumor that's coming out

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Is Punch Out for the Wii

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
That's kind of a rad surprise

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Like that was one of the things you didn't really think

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Of that, but that makes sense

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
If Wii Boxing was so big, why not

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Throw in the beloved Punch Out characters

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Mr. Dream

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Mike Tyson

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
George Foreman

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Put him in the game

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I guess, we need to fucking Excite Truck 2

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Fuck this Punch Out shit

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
We'll see

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
The news conference is only days away

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
So we'll see

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
We'll see

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Well here's what I'm worried about

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Because Nintendo, they have a trend

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Of following stupid ideas sometimes

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
With the whole Wii Wheel

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And the Wii Zapper

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
It was just like

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Hey the Wii Wheel, people buy those stupid

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Third party wheels because they want to pretend

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
That they have a steering wheel because they can't

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Use their imagination

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Let's put one out too

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Hey, they can't imagine that it's a gun

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
It would look like a gun

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
What are we going to have with the fucking boxing gloves or something?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I mean seriously

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
There's going to be some really retarded stuff

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Coming out I'm sure

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
There'll be storage dammit! I want my storage

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
You know what this show

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Needs you guys

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Before we wrap it up and take some calls

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And get out of here for the night

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
You know what this show needs? More Journey

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
That's right

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
We have some Journey news for you guys tonight

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
But it's kind of

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Kind of a little bit saddening

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
About this particular Journey news

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Actually apparently

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Steve Perry who used to be the front man

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
For Journey

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
He did an interview this week with GQ

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Magazine and you can actually read it online

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
At men.style.com

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And he actually talked about

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
The Journey arcade game

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
And if you've never played the arcade game

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Run, do not walk

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
To Mame and check this out

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Yes it's a cheesy game but

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
For it's time period it was awesome

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Because the actual cabinet

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Would play the song separate ways

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
On tape

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
When you beat the game you were at a Journey concert

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And separate ways would play on tape and it was awesome

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
And then the aliens would kidnap all their instruments again

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
However Steve Perry

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Says oh no no no

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I never thought we should have done the game

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
He's being your typical rock snob

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
He says everybody went against me on that issue

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Because I thought it was silly

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I've come to find out there's a generation of kids

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Who think it's classic and wish they could find the arcade version

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
But I personally thought it was kind of dumb

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Hmph

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And then you get this

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
As if the ego wasn't big enough

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
See it's funny because I thought that we were big already

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
That we didn't need a video game

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
But that's just how the world judges you

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Like gee whiz you have a Lamborghini so you must be big

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I didn't understand that

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Whatever

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Like seriously go watch some of your own 80's music videos

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And yeah then come back to me

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Come back to me and talk

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I still love Journey though

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
And I still love Steve Perry even if he's a rock snob

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Who kind of said a dumpy thing this week

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Journey's still awesome

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Don't let anybody tell you different

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Right Dark Sakura?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Right!

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
And and and and

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And the ferret

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Alright

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Before we close out the show tonight

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
We have to get some calls

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
We have to pay respect to our elders this week

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
By revisiting the classics

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
And we have for you guys

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
If Jamie doesn't drop her microphone much more

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
We have for you a trip down memory lane

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
With this the classic game of the week

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
And apparently

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Dark Sakura's opting for

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Like a classic of classics

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Like a just freaking like

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I don't want to say obvious choice

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
But just a choice

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
That had to be here eventually

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Had to

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Right? Absolutely

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
So what did you pick for the kids tonight?

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Chrono Trigger

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Of course

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Also it's because Sauce suggested it too

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Oh I was going to speculate maybe it was tied into the recent

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Announcement of the DS conversion

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
That's part of it too

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I had to play like the best music in the game

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
This is like my favorite music in the game

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
My second favorite music in the game

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Let's hear a little louder what is this?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
It's the old palace music

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Awesome

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Alright go ahead

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Anyway it was

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
A role play game that came out on the

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Super Nintendo

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Super Famicom

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It was released in Japan on March 11th 1995

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
And August 22nd 1995

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
In North America

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
It actually has

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I think it's great they mention this

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Square's dream team

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Was behind it which was

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Hironobu Sakaguchi

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Nobuo Uematsu

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Also

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
The main artist behind the characters

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Was Akira Toyama

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Who did the Dragon Quest series

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
And we better know for Dragon Ball

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And Dr. Slump

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Now remember

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Water summons wind and wind makes fire dance

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
So

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
A lot of the musical score

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Was done by Yasunori Mitsuda

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Who

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Actually passed on his duties

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
To Uematsu when he fell ill

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
So

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
But a lot of the way

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
That this game played

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Is that

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
It was sort of an action

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Slash sort of turn based RPG

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
You could totally avoid some of the battles

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Because you'd see the enemies hanging out

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
But if you wanted to

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Go into the battle you'd like

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
You would run up to the creatures they would spot you

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And then your battle sequence would start

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And the style is actually sort of

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Reminds me of later on in the Evolution series

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Did you ever play that?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Evolution and Grandia?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Not really I think I've seen it but not really played it

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
I've seen some of the elements came in

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
But it was also very much though

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
The Secret of Mana incorporated some of the same stuff too

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Where

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
You would see your enemies instead of having

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Just a random

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
You know, encounter

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And you would have

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Everyone had hit points, they would have magical weaknesses

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
But the really cool thing about this

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And this is actually called

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
The Active Time Battle System

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Which

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Actually was designed

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
For Final Fantasy 4

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Which we had up here is 2

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Where you have a personal timer

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
That's based on

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Your character speed statistic

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
And you also get text

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
This is your magic attack but the good thing about them

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Is that you could

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Combine your text with other people

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Once you

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Use them enough and

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
You would have like for example the

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Antipode attack so it was the fire and ice attack

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Remember that?

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
And you get different levels of those

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Or the

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
I just remember Frog's giant bouncing frog

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
That was awesome

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
That's actually in this clip too

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Later on

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Dude this person

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Played through the entire freaking game and it's all on YouTube

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Like 120 some odd parts

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
It's huge

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Like 15 minutes a piece

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Ultimaga weapon

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Well the other

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
The other really neat

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Like another example by the way

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
It was combining Chrono Cyclone Tech with Lucas

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Flame Toss to create Flame World

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
As their attack

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Also the other cool thing

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Is because you would guess by

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Using Chrono in the title that it has to do with time

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
It did have time travel

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
You could go to the same place

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
In time

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And for a while you'd only have like certain

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Ways that you could do it

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
But as you progressed you eventually got a ship

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
That would let you go through time

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
And you would do

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Different things through different parts

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Of the game and the best thing about it was

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
New Game Plus

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Where you would start your game

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Over with everything intact

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Except for

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
The special equipment

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
That were part of the storyline to find

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Like the Masamune

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
The characters in it

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
You had Chrono who was like your main guy

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
And his was the

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
The lightning based attack

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I do believe

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
And then you had

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Luca, you had Marle

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
You also had a bonus character

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Which was Magus

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
But you can either

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Keep him or let him go depending on whatever you said to him

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
You also had

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
A bajillion different endings in this

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
And to refer to the

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
The actual

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Super Nintendo version, sorry

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
You actually do believe that you had

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Fourteen endings I want to say

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
So it was actually

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Fairly sweet

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Including one where you get to hang with the developers

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Which is kind of cool

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That one was my favorite just because

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Sorry about that high pitch noise, that's the game they're transporting right now

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
But um

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
It was just

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
The game was epic

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
And there was a Playstation release

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
That had I do believe

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
An extra dungeon in it

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And also another ending

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Plus it had animated cut scenes

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
In it

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
As far as the

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Original release

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
It actually did have

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Some pretty interesting

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I guess innovations to the cartridge itself

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
There was however a bit of controversy

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
That an

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Unfinished version of the game

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Had a ROM linked up

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
On the internet

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Back in 95

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
That had

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Music that was not used in the game

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
And a dungeon called the singing mountain

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
And another

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Character that

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
There were other sprites for characters

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
That never were used

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I wonder if we'll see that in the DS

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Well um

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I do want to say that I think

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
That level

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Was used eventually

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
But I never played the Playstation version

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
So I'm not, don't quote me on that one

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
And also Chrono Cross was

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
A true sequel to it

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
In one of the

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Anime cut scenes

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
That was for Chrono Cross

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It led up to Luca

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Finding a kid for

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Sorry for Chrono Trigger, it led up to Luca

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Finding a kid for Chrono Cross

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
It was sort of interesting

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It's rumored also

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
That Chrono Trigger is supposed to be coming

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
On to

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Virtual console

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
There is going to be a DC

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
DS sorry, DS release

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Which in my opinion

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Means the Virtual Console 1 won't happen

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Why would they only make $15 off the Virtual Console 1

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
When they can charge $35.40 for the DS 1

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Unless they're going to innovate something

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
But it looks so far

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
The trailer is actually up at ChronoTrigger.jp

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Or.co.jp

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
So you can see it looks just the same

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
But there was another

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Project that I don't know if you had ever heard of

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Called Chrono Resurrection

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I think we covered it on the show a while ago

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
But yeah, it looked awesome

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
And basically they were

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Redoing the whole thing in 3D

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And Squenix did release

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Cease and Desist

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
There are supposed to be ROM hacks

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Out there

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
But

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
As to where you can find them

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
If someone can find them, let me know

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
There's also plenty of good music

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
There's actually

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
An acid jazz

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Soundtrack release called Frank of Time

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
It's actually really good at listening to music

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
There's also

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Play Concerts had some

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Chrono Trigger music in it

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
And of course there's the regular soundtrack

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And of course you can find

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
There's an album called

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Time and Space, a tribute to

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Yasunori Mitsuda

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
And Chrono Symphonic

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Which was released by Overclock

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Wow

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Lots of stuff on Chrono Trigger

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Lots of fan art

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I had a thought, you know how the rumor was going around

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
That the Final Fantasy 11 folks are

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Supposed to be working on a new MMO

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
That's not Final Fantasy, what if it was

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Some type of Chrono Online

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
RPG, I bet it would work

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
The Satellaview had a release

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
A spin-off game

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Called Chrono Trigger Jet Bike

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Special, which is a mini-game

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
The whole racing scene that I hated

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
In Chrono Trigger

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
There was also

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
A 16 minute OAV

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It was called

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Numa no Monja

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Time and Space Adventures

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Which was

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I actually downloaded it today

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
But I watched it all on YouTube earlier

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
It's very silly, but it's got

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Some funny stuff in it

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
It's actually pretty cute

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Radical Dreamers

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Was

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Like a

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Scenario version

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
That was a side story to Chrono Trigger

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
That came out on Satellaview on X-96

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
So

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
There you go

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Alright, your classic game of the week

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Been a long time coming

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Chrono Trigger

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
For the Super Nintendo and soon to be a bunch of others

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
PlayStation I guess you could say

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
And soon to be the DS

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Who knows, maybe someday if people get what they want

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Virtual Console, there you have it

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Alright, now we are going to go

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And take your calls on the Skype line

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
At 1877

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Game OLR, username on Skype

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
However, quickly

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Before we take calls, I want to say tonight

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
We really want to hear your predictions

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
For E3

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Especially like Wild One, don't name things that have already been

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Somewhat confirmed, but what are your

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Kind of predictions for E3 tonight

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
It's the one and only Ravenstaufen

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Well, hello one and only Ravenstaufen

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
How you doing?

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Are you heading out to PAX to represent Deadpix Alive?

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Loserly will

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Oh, not you, well that's too bad

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
But ok, at least you got some representation

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Hey, we're asking everybody tonight

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
What are your predictions for E3 this year?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
What do you think is going to happen?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I think Reggie is going to come out and just announce something insane

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
He's just going to pull down his pants and say

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Here it is

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I don't know about that

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I think there might be

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Laws against him doing that in public

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
No really, anything game related

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
That maybe hasn't been touched on

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
That you think we'll see at E3?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Or that you want to see?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
You know what, I'm probably going to be the only one

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Here, and I'm

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Going to predict Wii Fit 2

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Wii Fit 2, this early

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Really, I would think if we're going to get Wii Fit 2

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
We'd hear about next E3, but that's just me

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Or some expansion of Wii Fit

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Because it's good, don't get me wrong

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
It's really good, but it's slim

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
So they need to put something out now

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
What do you think though

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
If Animal Crossing and Punch-Out

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Are their big flagship games for the Christmas season?

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Dude, Punch-Out

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Punch-Out with the

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Balance Board would be hot

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
It would be kind of fun

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
It would be nice

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
BlackWolf says they're going to announce when they actually put more Wii Fit

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
On shelves, I still can't find one

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Me neither, I tried to look for it when I bought

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Civ Rev Lucian and they didn't have it

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I lost 20 pounds

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
On Wii Fit

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Really?

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
See, ever since my pancreas issues, I've lost 30 pounds

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
And I'm just thinking, God, how much more could I lose

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
If Wii Fit got in the picture, you know?

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Crazy

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Anything else, any other predictions for E3 this year?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Not really

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Just that

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Just mostly, Sony's going to probably announce

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Probably an internet browser

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
For the, I mean

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
A radio

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
A radio for the PS3, because that would be nice

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
That would be nice, more listeners for us

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I am all for these independent

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Applications and ways to get the

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Independent radio out there

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Down with corporate radio, boo

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
One more thing

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I did get the iPhone 3G

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
And it's nice and fast

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Dark Soccer, you should get

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Shazam for your iPhone

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
What's Shazam?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Does it have anything to do with Captain Marvel?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
It does nothing to do with Captain Marvel

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Basically, it listens to

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Say you're listening to a song

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
And you have no idea what it is

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
And the iPhone will listen to that song

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
And tell you what it is

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
That's kind of cool, that's like some of those Verizon phones

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Yeah, I've heard about the Verizon thing, that's kind of neat

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I've got a real obscure song that I need a title to

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
So, I may have to hit that up

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Wait, wait, wait

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
You may have a usefulness for an Apple product?

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Well, I've tried those other services

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
That listen to the song

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
And they can't figure it out

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Interesting, I bet you

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
It probably only works with well known songs

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
This is obscure enough, but we'll see, you never know

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
That's why there's this radio station

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
The one radio station I will listen to

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
In town, is completely DJ free

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And it plays the music I like

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Which is like 90's, 80's and

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Today music, but it's all kind of alternative-y

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
But at the end of every song

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
They say the name and the artist

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
There's no DJ's on the network, but there's this little robotic

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Voice that will say, for instance,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Today I heard Duran, Duran

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
The Reflex, which is awesome

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
The Reflex

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
It's an awesome radio station, I gotta say

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Which is funny because it used to be the dentist office music station

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
But now it's pretty awesome

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Anyway, any other quick thoughts? We gotta go

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Yeah, one more thing

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
One more thing, last thing

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
The remote for the iPhone

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
To control your iTunes is great

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
That one is my favorite app

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I like the application called Flashlight

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Because I imagine you push a button

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
And it just turns your screen white

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Flashlight

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
It sure is, and I haven't tried that yet

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
iPhone is a flashlight, you can use that

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
How about an OLR app?

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
We need an OLR app on iPhone stat

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Are you working on it?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
You are not working on it

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Someone work on it for us, and bring our text-based game to

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
To iPhone, we need

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
iPhone Zork

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Alright, we gotta let you go, we want more predictions

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Take care, buddy

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Good luck with Dead Pigs Alive

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Hi, you're on Orange Line Radio, who's this?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Hey, hey, it's Ronneman from New York

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
You have been on the show too damn much recently

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
How was the flight back, good?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Yeah, there was a slight issue getting back

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
But we'll save that for another time

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Alright, fair enough. Hey, what are your predictions for E3?

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I believe I told you that last week

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
And I'll say it again

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Reggie Fils-May will come out on stage

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
And not just cockslap everyone

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
With his Wii as Raven Dolphin said

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
He will announce Star Fox

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
With twin sticks using the

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Wiimote and nunchuck

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I could go for that

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
There hasn't been any Star Fox

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Lovin' on the Wii, I could go for that

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
That's a realistic prediction

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Hell yes

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Anything else? What about the other systems

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
You Nintendo fanboy? What about Xbox and

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Sony World?

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Since they're doing this 60 gig thing

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I see them coming out saying

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
To everybody who bought a 360

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
In the past three months is getting a $50

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Rebate check and they're going to

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Announce 60 gig hard drives

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
For pickup because I'm running out of

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Space in my 360

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I doubt you on that one

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I think that goes with one of those early adopters technology

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
You just get screwed

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
You know what though, I still have the 20 gig and I'm doing fine

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
But I don't download movies or any of that stuff

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
And I don't rip a lot of music

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
And I uninstalled Final Fantasy XI

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
So I have most of my space, you know?

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
We have Guitar Hero and Rock Band

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
In the house, so yeah

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
One of those two, I don't download everything

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
But I download enough

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I will say though it is getting full

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
But I've been just deleting arcade trials

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
That I don't really use and I'm

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I usually got enough room

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
But at least it's got a

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Decent amount of space unlike a

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Certain other system which won't be named

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Which would be my prediction

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
If you ask me my prediction for E3

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I do think

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Our friends, Reggie Fils-May

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Is going to come out and address that issue and make that other guy

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
From Europe look like the jackass he is

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I hope, I hope

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
That's please plausible, I actually believe

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
That one more

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
The next conference will be on Xbox.com

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And it will probably be on Microsoft's site

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
They normally feed those

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I want to say if I remember right

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And I apologize if I misappropriating this

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Because I'm going to be talking about someone else's show

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
But I watch Twitter and I follow other podcasters on Twitter

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
I want to say Gamertag Radio

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Is running the Xbox conference

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Of course, because you know, Gamertag, hello

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
But I think they're running the Nintendo one too

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
On their site, so check it

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Awesome, I might definitely do that

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Yep, alright

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
We got to get more prediction calls, okay

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Cool, no problem, later guys

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Bye Jamie

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
What, no bye for Matt?

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Whatever

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
I love you Loki, you alright man

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Alright, take care

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
That was pretty good, I got to say

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Hi

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Hey, you're dropping out there a little bit bud

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Make sure you got everything else shut off

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
On your internets

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
That's alright

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Alright, give it a try, quickly

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
What are your predictions for this year's E3?

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Identify yourself too, who are you?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to say Gold Banjo

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Well hello Gold Banjo, what are your predictions for E3 this year?

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Okay

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Well, I'm hoping for maybe an F0 Wii

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
But I don't know if it'll happen

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
That is a mighty fine prediction

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And it may be a little bit fanboyish

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
But I'm with you on that

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Because I still will play F0 on the GameCube

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
F0 GX, I love F0

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Like, that is one of my favorite racing series, I love it

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
And GS68

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And what Rama said, I guess I'm hoping for that too

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
All the predictions so far are pretty good

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I don't know how many of them we'll see

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
But I'm excited about it

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
GS68 in chat says F0 is a dead series

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I hope to hell you're wrong

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I hope you're wrong, because I don't know about you Loki

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Aren't you a big F0 fan too?

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
I was only the last one, it was alright

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000
The problem with the arcade one, the only problem I had with the arcade one was the fact that

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
It only had four tracks

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
But my god, the GameCube and the way it linked together was awesome

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And just, oh man, I just

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Only problem was finding an arcade cabinet

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Is what?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Finding an arcade cabinet

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Yeah, yeah, true true

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Well, any other quick predictions?

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
A lot of our callers are jumping right to Nintendo

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
What about Microsoft and Sony camps?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Anything you got there?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Um, I don't have a PS3 or a 360

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
So who cares? Fuck them, right?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Yeah, one more thing about the F0 thing

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Sure sure

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
On the F0, you know the F0 expansion pack, right?

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
For that cancelled add-on for the N64

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Oh right, huh?

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
They had a car and track editor

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
But yet they never added that into GX when it came out

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Maybe I would hope that they would add that for the Wii

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000
And maybe some track and car sharing and stuff

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
That'd be awesome

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
That'd be pretty cool

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I'm gonna go play some F0 GameCube tonight

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Oh

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I got my GameCube controller for Mega Man

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I got a new memory card for the Mega Man game when I bought it

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Now I'm itching to play some F0

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
So thanks a lot

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
That's all good

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Alright, we gotta let you go buddy

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Take care and happy E3

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Yep, you too, bye

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Alright, bye bye

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
If you wanna give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Hey, this is Akdeft

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Hey Akdeft, I love your icon on Skype

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
By the way, it's a little Kirby chef

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
It's awesome

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And it looks like it's eating something

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Is it inhaling a cupcake? I can't tell

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
It's awesome though

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
What's your predictions for E3, sir?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I have two

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
One Nintendo related, another Sony one

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Let's give it some variety

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Let's hear your Sony one first

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Because everyone's done Nintendo right off the bat

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Okay, my Sony one is

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Sly Cooper 4 for the Playstation 3

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Or maybe a PSP game

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
A what for the PS3?

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Sly Cooper

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Oh, okay

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Sly Cooper

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Cool, okay

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
So some game announcements

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I definitely hope that it's going to be announced

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
It's a far shot

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Any reason why you're going for Sly Cooper?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Well, definitely

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Maybe because mainly

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Excuse me

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Because I'm a fan of the series

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
So I really hope that this time

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
It's going to be announced

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
No reason you can't have a little fanboyism

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
In your predictions, what about Nintendo?

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
A new Kirby game for the Wii

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
And so your icon's not just a clever icon

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Yeah, a Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
A new Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Well

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
The Kirby franchise needs a new

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
A definitely new game

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Like a lift-off

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
That Kirby drawing game

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
On the DS

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Might be kind of fun on the Wii

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I actually liked that game quite a bit

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
I don't remember, did it touch All-Stars or something?

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I liked that game, it was fun

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Yeah, one of my predictions on the forums

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
For this year was going to be a port

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
With using that same gameplay

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000
So I hope that Nintendo announces this on E3

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Alright, we'll see

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Akdeft, any other quick last thoughts before we get to some more predictions?

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:26.000
No, just thanks on the question for Tomotaro Rico

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Hey, no problem

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Hey, this show is not just about the three of us

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
It's about the listeners

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
When we can ask questions that we know our listeners don't want to hear

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
We ask them

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Alright, take care buddy

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
And I hope it does get back to them, by the way

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I think this will be our last call

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Then we're going to call it a night because we're running pretty long

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
DS68

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Well hello, you got through

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
What's your predictions for E3, buddy?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
The employees of Konami and Harmonix duke it out

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Over the whole Rock Battle lawsuit

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And it's a myth that an arcade game gets announced at E3 and the whole universe dies

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
So are you suggesting that Konami should bring back their Rumble Roses models

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
From a few E3s ago

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
And they can duke it out in Cream Corn or Jello Wrestling?

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
No, I was joking

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I wasn't

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Maybe, like you and some other cars have said

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Maybe Nintendo will address the storage space

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
To some sort of attachment to the Wii

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
That applies to the USB drive or something

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Yeah, just a patch that they could release overnight

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
That will let the USB drives work

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I don't know, call it a hunch

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Also, freaking Super Mario RPG gets it released on Virtual Console

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Ah, now there's a good fanboy prediction

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
We know it's coming eventually, right?

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
We heard the Japanese one

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
So you would think if it's coming out in Japan

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
It's got to come out here eventually

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
So we'll see

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Any other predictions, sir?

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.000
What about the Sony and Microsoft end of things?

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Well, I don't really know because

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
The only next-gen console I was at was the Wii

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I don't feel like I lost somebody for 360 or PS3 at the moment

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000
How about, I'll give you a fanboy one

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Because I would love to see this someday

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
How about a company announces in partnership

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
With either Microsoft or Sony

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000
A localized version of Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
For consoles?

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
No, I don't know

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000
That game seems like the kind of game that they're playing in arcades

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
The PS3 version of Wangan Midnight sucks balls

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Well, because it's a different thing

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
It's not related to the actual arcade series

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
That game's based off the arcade series

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
But the problem is though

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
It's a port of a PlayStation 1 game, I think

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
No

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Well, because it's based on

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.000
It and the original Wangan Midnight arcade game were based on Tokyo Extreme Racer for the PS2

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Or Dreamcast

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
So the magic just belongs in the arcades

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
It doesn't need to be brought home

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Yeah, some things in the arc

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I mean, that's what the arcade needs

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
More things that you can only experience in the arcade

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I mean, these days you can just easily port shmups and fighters to the consoles and PCs

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Fair enough, I'll give you that, sir

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Alright, we're gonna wrap it up, GS68

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
But thanks for the call, have a good one, okay?

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000
You too

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Alright, later

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
We will see what happens at E3

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
It all starts this week

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
It's gonna be awesome

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000
In the meantime though, we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
And wrap up the show tonight

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Think for yourself and learn to be offended

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
My final thought is

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I want a Hot Pocket

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Loki

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
My final thought is I have a bunch of last minute stories

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Oh yeah, we never get to last minute stories, I'm sorry

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Alright, last minute stories then, quickly

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Okay, real quick

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Madden soundtrack's coming to Rock Band's download content

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I guess that's kinda cool

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Did I leave that off the showroom? My bad

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Yeah

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I'm a dummy, alright

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Oni-chanbara, that game with the chicken lingerie and a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Is coming to the Wii in the US now

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Fuck yeah, that's awesome

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Here's one of my predictions to come out of E3

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:21.000
That there's gonna be a software patch for the Wii that will allow you to use the Wii classic controller

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Or perhaps this brand new trademark patented controller that Nintendo will be putting out

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
To be used with GameCube games

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Instead of having to actually have a GameCube controller

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
That makes sense

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Because they now have a new thing that looks like a very blocky version of a GameCube controller

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
That's kind of interesting

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Lots of rumored Xbox Live Arcade games to be coming out tomorrow through next week

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Including, there is a game by Bungie that's supposedly gonna debut on Xbox Live Arcade tomorrow

01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:00.000
There's also a rumor that they're gonna surprise us with Geometry Wars Retro Vault 2

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
That might be the surprise thing tomorrow

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:12.000
There are a couple other games that they mentioned as well, including, I don't know where to go here

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.000
There is some other like crosswords game that's gonna be coming out

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Which I don't know, that didn't look too exciting at all

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
They did announce that though, that's really happening

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Yeah, that's really happening

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:31.000
And there was also some other game, a shooter game, Shred Nebula

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
That's actually gonna be coming out

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Dude, I would not want to be crappy crosswords game in the week that Duke Nukem or Geometry Wars 2 or these other rumored things get released

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Exactly

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
There's one thing I do know

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000
There was an article, it was actually this week, about Blazing Lizard

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I guess they're being represented by Flash Man Studios

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
And you may not know who Blazing Lizard is

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:01.000
But they're the ones behind Pirates vs Ninja Dodgeball on Xbox Live Arcade

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
And they have an unannounced title for the Wii

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I know what that game is by chance

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
And it actually is Pirates vs Ninja Dodgeball

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
It's coming to the Wii now too

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Let's see, there's a pretty cool little game coming out called I Heart Geeks

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:25.000
It's a rude Goldberg puzzle game, kind of like in The Incredible Machine

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:31.000
And apparently there's some leaks out of Sony's support site about upcoming titles

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Including Punisher Warzone for the PS3

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:42.000
And Maxim Pinball, Cinnamon Beats, Alien Sports Mini Golf, and Under Fire

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Kind of interesting

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
There's gonna be a new Wolfenstein game at E3 this year

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.000
In fact that's already in the new Game Informer magazine

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
So check that out, it's pretty cool

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:59.000
And also rumored that Rock Band 2's setlist includes Guns N' Roses

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:05.000
And the Chinese Democracy Trek

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
That would be a pretty awesome little surprise

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
That could be very interesting

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000
And that's all I really want to talk about right now

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Alright

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Oh, I'm sorry, one more thing

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000
This is completely random

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I saw there was this list that was on game trailers

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
It's eight extremely embarrassing E3 moments

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
And the one that they have in the very beginning on here is Jamie Kennedy

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Remember his Activision little spiel last year was completely embarrassing

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
And he wasn't very funny

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I actually met Jamie Kennedy this Wednesday

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I have a picture with him actually

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000
It's pretty crappy

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
And I have a new autograph for our autograph wall

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Hooray

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
He's actually pretty funny in person

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I need to put the freeze-pop autograph up by the way

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
That Rama got me for my birthday

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
And I'm digging that new freeze-pop album actually

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
It's pretty fun

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Good times

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Alright, your final thought, Loki

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000
My final thought is I hopefully will finish OLR PSP this week

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.000
I know my wife is really hating that I'm working on this

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Did you want to change your final thought, Dark Soccer, since it's been so long?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
No

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000
And I will agree with Game Guru on a last final thought

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
E3 better rock

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I agree, especially since we're not there to party away

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Anyhow, meanwhile, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
And supporting Orange Lounge Radio

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
And just all independent radio with your support

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Remember if you like our show, we do it for free

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Just tell two people you know about Orange Lounge Radio

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Spread the word, that's all we ask

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And slowly but surely we take over the world

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
That's how it works

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Until next time, we'll be back next week with all of the E3 news

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.000
And if anything especially strikes us, we may go live mid-week

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
We'll see, well not live, but a tape thing

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Because we can't invade other all-game show space

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
But maybe something mid-week, we'll see

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
In the meantime, I'm Rob Roberts

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
She's Dark Sakura, he's Loki

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
And this is Orange Lounge Radio

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
