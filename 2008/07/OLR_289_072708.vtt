00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
We are that podcast on the internet, dedicated to video games,

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
say hello to the one and only, the lovely, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
So I can see what you're excited about out of Comic Con.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Happy, happy, happy.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
So what is this, they're making a new Tron?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Just Tron 2, is all you need to be saying.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
And Jeff Bridges is in it.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, I saw that in the trailer.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
And he looks evil.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
What was up with that trailer though,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
like somebody shot it with a camera phone like a million miles away.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, but someone else went back in and tried to zoom in

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
and clean it up and get it looking as good as possible,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
so you can actually see some more stuff in it.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Are they that strict with cameras at Comic Con?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I mean, I would think with millions of people.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
That's Disney's panel.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.040
I would think that Disney would want to keep it

01:26.260 --> 01:30.840
Well you okay remember any at one of the last t3s that we went to when Kingdom Hearts 2 came out

01:31.000 --> 01:36.700
Mm-hmm Disney wouldn't let anything be filmed when a vista vista would hmm remember yeah, yeah

01:36.700 --> 01:39.940
Yeah, I remember that so I would use that as sort of a past precedent

01:40.660 --> 01:44.240
Yeah, but still what are they gonna do? There's like thousands of people at Comic Con

01:44.240 --> 01:49.400
You know what I mean especially in those panels as far as I can tell though this this cell phone video was the only thing

01:49.400 --> 01:50.720
That I've seen

01:50.720 --> 01:55.000
So interesting well whatever they're doing it works, but I've never been to Comic Con

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Maybe next year. I'm going next year the one and only me Glatov. You've probably heard on this show

02:00.000 --> 02:02.560
He was a comic-con. He was giving me calls pretty much every day

02:02.560 --> 02:05.060
He got his picture with Siler and just had to rub it in my face

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
He's a jerk intensely

02:08.360 --> 02:10.920
Wasn't he sort of stalking him for a little while yeah kind of

02:11.680 --> 02:15.220
All right speaking of jerks say hello to tech master Loki

02:15.800 --> 02:17.160
Just kidding

02:17.160 --> 02:22.640
Hey, I'm doing fine. Were you just watching a little preview because I was reading up on it

02:22.640 --> 02:27.040
But you know I didn't know that they actually had filmed it of course you have to assume that

02:27.400 --> 02:31.760
Anything that says do not film someone's gonna film it so exactly exactly especially something is

02:32.280 --> 02:35.320
Widely anticipated is that yeah, so hey just think about it

02:35.320 --> 02:40.440
It'll make a great video game except then again. There was a Tron 2.0 stop anybody do very well

02:40.440 --> 02:42.640
I think there's they should go ahead and try again

02:43.680 --> 02:45.680
There's a better the freeware

02:45.680 --> 02:47.600
or share where a

02:47.600 --> 02:52.760
Light cycle game out though on the internet that someone did and Dan was playing it for a while. It's really really good cool

02:52.760 --> 02:57.800
I remember surround on the Atari 2600 that was just light cycles well remember that

02:58.400 --> 03:00.640
Anyhow if you want to join us in our chat room

03:00.640 --> 03:06.840
We are live in the chat room on this lovely Sunday evening that we're taping July the 27th of 2008 on episode number

03:07.720 --> 03:09.720
289 of our podcast damn world

03:10.080 --> 03:13.320
chat that orange launch radio comm is the place to be if you want to

03:13.320 --> 03:19.560
join in with the chat, and I'm just trying to look at some of the comments in chat right now and

03:20.120 --> 03:23.300
Some people are just kind of making fun of the whole do not copy policy

03:23.640 --> 03:29.200
And all that stuff and some people are commenting about how during the previous show the Bobby Black Wolf show on all games radio

03:29.360 --> 03:33.760
Loki could not contain his foul mouth on the family programming that was a Bobby Black Wolf show

03:34.440 --> 03:38.080
Some people in there commenting on that if you want to hear that you got to listen to Bobby show though

03:38.080 --> 03:40.080
He's available at all games calm

03:40.120 --> 03:42.120
Click on Bobby Black Wolf show

03:42.120 --> 03:45.160
Alright, let's get into um. How was your gaming week?

03:45.160 --> 03:50.980
We always start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, so how was your gaming week Dark Sakura after the response who?

03:51.500 --> 03:56.400
Ronchon real quick sure he said he handed me he who shall not be named us still beating heart

03:56.440 --> 03:58.440
But that means you'd have to have a heart first

03:59.760 --> 04:03.740
Instead of a lump of coal nice like some like the evil Smurfette did

04:05.400 --> 04:07.160
All right so gaming week

04:07.160 --> 04:12.880
I played stuff actually I did finally start Aurora faint, and that gives freaking cool. I

04:14.240 --> 04:20.320
Don't know much about this game. Tell us a little bit about Aurora. It's an iPhone game. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, okay? That is

04:21.080 --> 04:26.440
It's it's sort of like how will be to help be jeweled does except you can only move them horizontally

04:26.520 --> 04:30.200
But you can sort of slide as as you destroy groups

04:30.200 --> 04:35.240
They fall off sort of like how Puyo Puyo does when you you know but you can actually move blocks off to the side

04:35.240 --> 04:39.080
And and move them that way move them laterally into empty spaces

04:39.160 --> 04:44.520
So it's sort of a neat a neat thing and you can level up and learn new techniques

04:44.520 --> 04:48.960
and it's a very cool little game and and very pretty and shiny and

04:50.600 --> 04:52.320
I played

04:52.320 --> 04:55.060
This other thing called color spiral, but all it is is just

04:55.680 --> 05:01.760
Drawing really awful circles on the iPhone so it sucks, and I got a sudoku game just to try it

05:01.760 --> 05:08.560
I got it's just called sudoku free and it actually it's kind of neat really you know easy as in

05:08.960 --> 05:11.020
really easy as in

05:12.080 --> 05:18.000
But it's it's it's pretty the interface is pretty you can choose your color. I've done something similar

05:18.000 --> 05:18.960
I've had just this week

05:18.960 --> 05:24.740
I downloaded coffee time crosswords because I kind of felt obligated as it is a new Xbox Live arcade title to kind of look at

05:24.740 --> 05:25.920
it and

05:25.920 --> 05:30.480
My obligation dried up in about three minutes. I was just like this game is poopy well to answer

05:30.480 --> 05:32.480
an alpha

05:32.500 --> 05:33.960
Kynanogram

05:33.960 --> 05:36.240
The game was called aurora faint

05:36.800 --> 05:43.720
Fe int like a battle maneuver. It sounds a little like medios with the whole sideways only movement thing

05:43.720 --> 05:45.460
You'll have to give it a try. You'll have to get a try

05:45.460 --> 05:49.340
You can actually make a character on my phone if you want that's cool or one of these days

05:49.340 --> 05:54.960
I'll finally break down to buy an iPhone one of these days. I hear people are still lining up for that stuff. That's crazy

05:55.560 --> 05:57.560
but also um I

05:57.920 --> 05:59.720
I

05:59.720 --> 06:03.940
Downloaded something else. I actually think that I might though try uh I

06:04.600 --> 06:08.280
Was actually this was it. I was about to download miss pac-man and

06:09.720 --> 06:14.520
Apparently it's utter crap, so I didn't do it because

06:15.040 --> 06:18.920
The there's no real good way to control it um I can imagine

06:19.280 --> 06:22.360
They should do marble madness for iPhone though if they can do monkey ball

06:22.360 --> 06:28.880
They can do marble madness good time, but monkey ball sucks on iPhone. Just letting you know really yes, you have to um

06:28.880 --> 06:33.160
To play just right instead of holding your phone at a perfect um

06:34.360 --> 06:40.000
Flat angle you actually have to tilt it away from you downwards to have it be in the neutral position

06:40.680 --> 06:42.360
so it's

06:42.360 --> 06:44.360
really

06:44.600 --> 06:46.160
Not

06:46.160 --> 06:47.640
good

06:47.640 --> 06:54.400
Um I also I did play some Ragnarok, but not quite as much as I have been because I've been doing a lot of homework

06:54.400 --> 07:00.280
I did though get some some fantastic nerd time yesterday

07:00.640 --> 07:05.720
Wasn't video game related, but but a video game was going to come out for it, and they canceled it and it pissed me off

07:06.440 --> 07:07.120
What's that?

07:07.120 --> 07:11.800
I watched a whole crap ton of stargate sg1 that is pretty nerdy friend Becky

07:11.800 --> 07:14.640
And I are finally finishing up the fourth season box set

07:16.160 --> 07:21.680
And I remember how excited I was at e3 when they had the big stargate thing up

07:21.680 --> 07:26.120
And I was like oh hell. Yes. Do you want and then did the game ever come out? No? No?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.400
canceled

07:28.400 --> 07:29.440
I

07:29.440 --> 07:32.360
Was like don't let me take your picture in front of the giant stargate

07:32.360 --> 07:38.360
I remember that right that was awesome as I love me some stargate except. I do not like stargate at Linda's

07:39.200 --> 07:45.480
Okay, not very much. All right before this turns into a nerdy sci-fi talk show any other games um

07:45.480 --> 07:53.140
No, all right not that there's anything wrong with a game of life not that there's anything wrong with a nerdy sci-fi

07:53.140 --> 07:57.120
Talk show because we have like pod culture. We know them and like them and

07:57.760 --> 08:00.200
Travis Donovan under station live they kind of do something

08:01.120 --> 08:02.480
Do it?

08:02.480 --> 08:06.620
Hi, Travis. All right moving on. Thank you. How was your gaming week?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.620
My gaming week was okay. I played

08:09.620 --> 08:16.420
I played Magnetica because I haven't actually tried that yet on the DS, and it was pretty fun

08:16.420 --> 08:18.940
it's sort of like Zuma a little bit, but

08:19.540 --> 08:22.300
They add a few things to actually make it different

08:22.300 --> 08:24.500
So that was kind of neat try to get my wife to play it

08:24.500 --> 08:27.060
And she said I don't like the way it aims and it that sucks

08:27.060 --> 08:32.260
So I'm not touching it then meanwhile she ends up playing it anyways and then still complains about it

08:32.740 --> 08:35.220
She's been playing super collapse 3 instead

08:35.220 --> 08:40.100
I also tried Final Fantasy 4 briefly and I

08:40.860 --> 08:46.380
got to say that I wish it was just a port of the Super Nintendo version because I

08:47.060 --> 08:53.180
Don't really care for the new 3d graphics. Especially when they they have all their like most of the cutscenes are in-game

08:53.700 --> 09:00.980
Using the in-game engine and when you get really close to some of those characters man those textures are really low-res

09:01.260 --> 09:03.580
but overall it's it's pretty good and

09:03.580 --> 09:07.960
And then I played also Korg 10 DS

09:08.760 --> 09:13.060
Which isn't really a game, but more of you know an actual piece of

09:13.780 --> 09:18.240
Synthesizer software and so played around with that, but since I don't really know how to use a Korg 10

09:18.240 --> 09:22.260
I didn't really make much with it, but it's fun

09:22.260 --> 09:27.440
It's it'll be cool to play around with and then on a 360

09:28.080 --> 09:30.080
Of course more Grantham thought of four

09:30.080 --> 09:33.040
I don't really have to say much more about that and

09:35.360 --> 09:36.560
Also

09:36.560 --> 09:38.640
Tried out on the Wii

09:39.600 --> 09:42.840
Wario Land shake which just got released in Japan and

09:44.440 --> 09:46.540
It's awesome. It really is it's

09:47.360 --> 09:54.580
You know a perfect example of how they can do really good 2d platform games now with the technology

09:54.580 --> 09:59.040
That's out there all hand-drawn animation. They have anime cutscenes

09:59.040 --> 10:06.120
It's really cool. It really is and sadly enough. If only Nintendo had actually talked a little bit about this game

10:07.120 --> 10:11.520
at e3 they might have actually saved their you know a little press conference, but

10:12.520 --> 10:14.520
whatever and

10:14.560 --> 10:20.480
Then let's see what else that I play. I think that's about it. Actually. This is pretty brief

10:21.000 --> 10:25.760
Alright, well my gaming week. I also played Final Fantasy 4 quite a bit that pretty much dominated by gaming week

10:25.760 --> 10:27.760
You know Final Fantasy 4 is probably

10:27.760 --> 10:31.600
My favorite maybe either my favorite or my second favorite

10:31.600 --> 10:36.100
I haven't decided but it's one of my favorites of the is fun entire Final Fantasy series

10:36.100 --> 10:41.800
I definitely like it more than any of the PlayStation ones or even Final Fantasy 10 or hell even 12. I

10:42.320 --> 10:47.560
Love Final Fantasy 4 and so it was very interesting to kind of revisit that world on the DS

10:47.640 --> 10:54.040
It's kind of interesting because the difficulty you definitely can sense the change in the difficulty if you kind of grew up on Final Fantasy 2

10:54.040 --> 10:58.840
American like I did you definitely can feel the change in the difficulty, you know

10:58.840 --> 11:02.600
you could kind of breeze right through the Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo and

11:02.920 --> 11:07.520
Just you didn't really have to grind or anything like that. You do need to do a little bit not a lot

11:07.520 --> 11:10.440
I mean that gets annoying in role-playing games. You'll have to do a lot of grinding

11:10.440 --> 11:13.480
You have to do a little bit to kind of make sure that your characters aren't you know

11:13.480 --> 11:15.080
Getting completely overpowered by the enemies

11:15.080 --> 11:20.720
You definitely feel the ramp up in the difficulty of what the enemies are casting on you the speed of how they're attacking

11:20.720 --> 11:24.160
You know and all of that you can definitely feel an increased difficulty in the game

11:24.160 --> 11:28.880
And it kind of makes it feel like a whole new experience. Also, you have the new translation and everything

11:28.880 --> 11:32.100
I really like that they put voice acting in the game

11:32.100 --> 11:37.000
It's kind of neat even though it only shows up in a few select scenes. They actually pull it off on the DS pretty well

11:37.460 --> 11:40.640
It's not a plus level voice acting but it's not terrible

11:40.800 --> 11:46.240
It does add a certain element to the story that I've just loved for so many years

11:46.400 --> 11:49.960
My biggest complaint about the game would be the exact same thing as Loki

11:49.960 --> 11:54.840
I don't like the graphics. I don't like the look very much of what they've given the game

11:54.840 --> 11:57.760
It feels like I'm playing an old PlayStation 1 game

11:57.760 --> 12:03.040
Well, it's like all the cutscene choppy and even thought it feels like even Final Fantasy 7 looked better than this

12:03.040 --> 12:08.880
The cutscenes don't have the same like style of graphics as you know, the actual game itself, you know

12:08.880 --> 12:13.880
The cutscenes make it look all badass and everything is all realistic looking and then all of a sudden it's just like

12:13.880 --> 12:20.080
Cartoony, it's not like Final Fantasy 7 where you know, the graphics were kind of cartoony

12:20.080 --> 12:24.400
But the cutscenes the characters were also a bit cartoony as well

12:25.000 --> 12:31.420
It's just it doesn't match whatsoever. You go with this really like super deformed looking character to like ultra realistic

12:31.420 --> 12:33.280
It's just not I don't know what it is

12:33.280 --> 12:38.380
But I would have almost just preferred redone sprites like I think of the Final Fantasy PSP games

12:38.480 --> 12:42.660
Those games are beautiful and they're still sprite based but they look amazing

12:42.660 --> 12:45.800
You know, I really like the look on those and that's kind of what I've almost wish

12:46.400 --> 12:51.360
This had been and I I see Game Guru and Chad is saying just get Final Fantasy 4 advanced

12:51.360 --> 12:59.240
I mean, yeah, but that was just basically a port with you know, the new translation and and possibly that ramped up difficulty

12:59.240 --> 12:59.440
I mean

12:59.440 --> 13:03.280
I do like some of the other frills in the DS game such as I kind of think that whole

13:03.560 --> 13:08.520
Wit the the extra summon there Rydia has the wit that you can actually customize

13:08.520 --> 13:13.680
I don't know how far you got but once you pick up Rydia and you can't you actually get to Kaipo the desert town

13:13.680 --> 13:17.260
You kind of can play your first, you know training your wit game and that's actually one of the summons

13:17.260 --> 13:20.600
That will replace Rydia for a certain time and you can teach it battle commands

13:20.600 --> 13:24.260
You actually level it up through these silly little DS games like the math game

13:24.260 --> 13:28.720
Which I actually thought the math game was kind of fun for a mini game. Maybe it's just the nerd in me

13:28.720 --> 13:33.160
I don't know, but I thought there were some nice touches and some nice additions that they did in the game

13:33.160 --> 13:39.520
I like the whole map thing that they use the bottom screen is basically a map of a dungeon and when you get a hundred

13:39.520 --> 13:42.540
Percent completion on a map like if you've explored the whole map

13:43.000 --> 13:44.800
You get like a little bonus

13:44.800 --> 13:50.400
Like maybe an extra tent or an extra Phoenix down something definitely for the completionist in all of us

13:50.400 --> 13:51.720
And I do also kind of like that

13:51.720 --> 13:52.240
You know

13:52.240 --> 13:58.840
It seems like the abilities that were removed in the translation from Japan to America such as Rosa's prey ability

13:58.840 --> 14:04.440
Cecil's darkness ability these things are now back in the game and you can add extra abilities to the characters

14:04.520 --> 14:09.180
That's where I think this game is a little bit superior to just direct port like you had on advance

14:09.280 --> 14:10.640
Maybe with a new translation

14:10.640 --> 14:16.960
I just think I would be more impressed if they just would have put this on a CD based system even ps2

14:17.480 --> 14:23.900
You know, I just think the graphics would have been a lot better. I I just maybe I'm biased or whatever you call

14:23.900 --> 14:26.880
I just don't like the DS for think for projects like this

14:26.880 --> 14:33.000
I don't like that all these things these redone old classic games are coming out all on the DS because I don't

14:33.520 --> 14:35.360
You know the DS

14:35.360 --> 14:41.960
Kind of lends itself to a different outside the box kind of game making not so much the translations of old games exactly

14:41.960 --> 14:46.680
I think I'll play this more when it comes out on the PSP when we get like Final Fantasy 3 and 4

14:46.680 --> 14:52.380
I hope I hope it does just like they did 1 & 2 I mean because I liked 1 & 2 I thought well

14:52.380 --> 14:56.680
I didn't really like to that much but I I wouldn't have liked it no matter what system it was on

14:56.680 --> 15:00.400
But Final Fantasy 1 I liked a lot on there and I like the way they did it

15:00.400 --> 15:03.760
It doesn't have to be all fancy 3d graphics and to be honest, you know

15:03.760 --> 15:08.980
I think they wasted a lot of effort with it because now they have to redo all the characters redo all the scenes and all

15:08.980 --> 15:12.000
That stuff and for what it just looks mediocre

15:12.000 --> 15:18.120
I don't know and Bobby Blackwell's trying to be cute and chat make a joke. He says confirmed. Oh, LR DS haters

15:18.200 --> 15:23.840
No, I'm not a DS hater. I like the games that are kind of made for a DS like trauma center great game

15:23.840 --> 15:25.540
You can't play that really anywhere else

15:25.540 --> 15:30.480
I mean, I guess you can't on the Wii but that's a whole nother story cooking mama is actually kind of fun on the DS

15:31.240 --> 15:36.360
You know, there's lots of these types of games on the DS even even things like Metroid Prime hunters and stuff that you can't really

15:36.360 --> 15:39.700
Get you know on other types of systems. I don't like

15:40.720 --> 15:46.720
Trying to make an old 8-bit Nintendo game work on this new idea of you know how to control a game

15:47.760 --> 15:53.120
And that's the other thing that's my other big problem with Final Fantasy 4 is that it needs an analog stick

15:53.120 --> 15:56.600
Trying to control Cecil which all these years

15:56.600 --> 16:02.160
I thought it was Cecil but according to the voice acting at Cecil trying to control Cecil in that 3d environment

16:02.160 --> 16:09.040
Where basically everything's rotated at 45 degrees it sucks because diagonals on the DS are kind of hard to pull off with that little

16:09.040 --> 16:10.820
You know, I don't know about okay

16:10.820 --> 16:17.560
I don't know if if there were other like things that I missed but I you can control the way he runs and stuff

16:17.760 --> 16:21.000
Using the stylus, but I was unable to like interact with anybody

16:21.000 --> 16:26.040
Using the stylus. I had to like stop and push a button which I thought was retarded

16:26.040 --> 16:30.780
You do need to play a little more Final Fantasy 4 and get your wit leveled up so we can do the wireless battle

16:30.780 --> 16:32.260
Because I'm kind of curious how that works

16:32.260 --> 16:32.740
Okay

16:32.740 --> 16:36.920
So play play a little more at least till you get it so we can kind of check that feature out because I don't know

16:36.920 --> 16:38.700
How many people I know are gonna get this game?

16:38.700 --> 16:44.520
Although I do recommend it if you're a Final Fantasy fanboy fangirl, it's worth checking out

16:44.860 --> 16:46.540
Especially if you've never played the game

16:46.540 --> 16:52.200
You've never been through the story you must now is the time to experience the Final Fantasy 4 story because it's great

16:53.020 --> 16:57.400
But if you have played the old games you you know have already kind of made your way through them

16:57.740 --> 17:03.780
I still say it's worth a look. It would be nice if it was a little bit cheaper because it's a $40 DS game, but

17:04.300 --> 17:10.260
It's not gonna be a waste of your time. It is, you know, kind of a different experience. So there you have it

17:10.260 --> 17:16.580
And then Bobby and chat commented again. He said confirmed. Oh LR likes to debunk black wolf. Oh

17:18.100 --> 17:20.100
Bobby you're great

17:21.100 --> 17:27.460
Game guru says look every port or remake of an nest and super nest for the DS means no PlayStation Network or virtual console

17:27.460 --> 17:31.020
Port and that makes me mad. I kind of I kind of agree

17:31.020 --> 17:37.040
I almost think the PSP lends itself better to these types of old 8-bit games being remade if the Final Fantasy 1 and 2

17:37.040 --> 17:42.920
Uh recreations or any guide because those were great. I would like to see Final Fantasy 6 redone

17:42.920 --> 17:48.220
I know that is like the holy grail of Final Fantasy to a lot of people but I would like to see a

17:48.700 --> 17:53.080
New approach taken to it. I just kind of don't want it on the DS. I'd like to see it as a

17:54.400 --> 17:58.760
Remade for at least the ps2 if nothing else make it a budget title for the ps2 if nothing else

17:58.760 --> 18:00.440
There'll be tons of people that want it

18:00.440 --> 18:02.520
We'll see also in my gaming week

18:02.520 --> 18:07.640
I mean that was pretty much the majority of it, but I also was playing some more civilization revolution, which is a game

18:07.640 --> 18:12.240
I think is pretty cool, and I noticed Bobby black wolf was playing Civ revolution speaking of Bobby

18:12.240 --> 18:13.840
He was playing that quite a bit this weekend

18:13.840 --> 18:19.320
So I'm thinking Bobby and I need to have World War 3 at some point on civilization revolution

18:19.320 --> 18:21.320
Even though I'm not that great at the game. He'll probably beat me

18:22.040 --> 18:24.040
Hopefully he sucks too and we can just have fun with it

18:24.840 --> 18:26.400
and

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
Also, I've been playing that new

18:28.960 --> 18:31.020
Xbox Live arcade game that came out the

18:31.020 --> 18:36.420
The street dancing game whose name I accidentally closed the window. What was it the go-go beat?

18:38.300 --> 18:41.660
Let me look at go go beat steady, I think that was the name of it

18:41.660 --> 18:45.620
I had it earlier. I play I was just you can tell I didn't play a whole lot of go go break steady

18:45.620 --> 18:47.780
that's name it I played it for a little bit and

18:48.460 --> 18:50.100
I

18:50.100 --> 18:55.460
Kind of like the concept. I liked the fact that it kind of starts in this guitar room and style

18:55.460 --> 18:59.920
You know buttons coming from the outside of the screen to the inside and the better you hit them in rhythm

18:59.920 --> 19:03.500
Then you go into a puzzle game like Zuma and I kind of thought that was cool

19:03.500 --> 19:09.900
It's just that the music, you know, the hip-hop and breakdancing music is not really something I get excited about in the video game

19:10.580 --> 19:14.700
But I know there are people that do get excited for that. So I'm glad there's a decent music video

19:15.300 --> 19:19.700
Music video game that kind of incorporates that so I think for that reason alone. It's worth checking out

19:20.380 --> 19:27.520
But I would like to see that whole kind of puzzle music game fusion applied to other genres and music

19:27.520 --> 19:29.060
I think it could be kind of cool

19:29.060 --> 19:31.060
So that's it for my gaming week

19:32.220 --> 19:36.500
Housekeeping tonight before we get into some gaming news honestly don't have a lot just gonna give the same old plugs

19:36.500 --> 19:41.720
We usually do for you know, our Facebook community at facebook.com search for the ol army

19:41.720 --> 19:43.740
You can join us on there at live journal

19:43.740 --> 19:48.860
we are username orange lounge on live journal and we always you know post little plugs for the show or other bonus things we do and

19:49.260 --> 19:55.520
Of course our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com our myspace orange lounge radio and our YouTube channel

19:55.520 --> 20:01.420
Is that orange lounge radio? I believe is our YouTube. It's been a long time as I've logged into I believe

20:01.420 --> 20:03.740
That's orange lounge radio. I've still yet to put my video

20:03.740 --> 20:08.140
Yes, you need to put your video on there and I'm gonna be putting the olr PSAs on there as well

20:08.500 --> 20:10.840
For the folks that want to hear those again outside the show

20:11.180 --> 20:15.900
We're gonna put those on there too, even though there's not a lot of video to go with them. At least it's something

20:16.580 --> 20:21.060
All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Shall we sure? All right. All right

20:21.060 --> 20:27.380
All right. Well, you know being that e3 was not really this week, but last week

20:28.140 --> 20:30.140
There's been a lot of you know

20:30.420 --> 20:37.520
Either disappointment or just a lot of opinions about it and a couple publishers one being Bethesda

20:38.040 --> 20:44.860
has been trying to defend e3 saying that it is still needed, but it needs to change a bit and

20:46.540 --> 20:48.620
You know kind of what they've been saying is

20:48.620 --> 20:53.320
You know before it used to be very, you know bustling very lots of people in there

20:53.660 --> 20:55.660
but now it's just vacant and

20:56.020 --> 20:59.860
You know, not that many people come and visit them and I think Bethesda. I mean, they're not a

21:00.620 --> 21:01.980
small

21:01.980 --> 21:08.100
Publisher by any means but at the same time they're not like I remember when you know you guys visit Bethesda

21:08.700 --> 21:13.540
Their booth wasn't that big not compared to like, you know, EA or you know, Microsoft or something like that

21:13.540 --> 21:19.820
So maybe now that everything's scaled down even more it's a lot of people might miss going to visit

21:19.820 --> 21:23.780
you know these smaller publishers that are there so that kind of sucks and

21:24.980 --> 21:32.560
Bethesda's booth was interesting though because is basically imagine their booth space was kind of like a donut where they had everything kind of around it

21:32.560 --> 21:36.260
They had some things on display kind of around on the on the actual donut shape

21:36.260 --> 21:40.900
but then in the middle where the donut hole would be was that like kind of special room where they were doing their little press

21:40.900 --> 21:43.940
events and dark soccer and I were lucky enough to get to go to one of them and

21:44.660 --> 21:50.660
Sit in the lovely air conditioning for a while and look at the Star Trek game that was coming out which that was great

21:51.460 --> 21:57.380
Unfortunately, it was one of those games. It was awesome in theory, but the execution unfortunately by the time the game actually came out

21:57.860 --> 22:02.580
It didn't work out so well, but we got excited about it watching is it was great in theory

22:02.580 --> 22:07.300
I actually taped the whole thing how they recreated the Erathicon battle was pretty awesome

22:07.300 --> 22:13.140
I know that was sweet, but yeah, anyhow, sorry, but but they just say that it needs to change

22:13.140 --> 22:17.460
They didn't really offer any suggestions of how it will change or how they you know

22:18.140 --> 22:20.140
want to change it, but I

22:20.580 --> 22:23.100
Don't know, but yay. Yay another

22:24.820 --> 22:27.900
Company also displeased with the current e3

22:28.540 --> 22:35.840
Ironically enough though. They're saying that it's soulless and that they would want it open to the public now

22:35.840 --> 22:38.440
They wish to invite the community to the show

22:39.360 --> 22:43.000
It's a bit ironic when you think about it because they were one of the companies

22:45.240 --> 22:50.360
Complaining that there was too many people at e3 and that they couldn't get any business done

22:50.560 --> 22:56.560
So instead they want to go back to where the way it was and then some I seem to remember us bringing up this

22:56.920 --> 23:01.340
Almost exact not not exactly sure if I seem to remember EA making similar comments last week

23:01.340 --> 23:05.160
Although I think this week it was what Peter Moore that said them specifically and you know

23:05.160 --> 23:10.040
Which is interesting because he used to be kind of Xbox's, you know spokesperson at those press conferences and things

23:10.520 --> 23:15.040
But it's just interesting. It's not it's not stopping from EA, you know, it's now now here we go

23:15.040 --> 23:17.900
Another person at EA kind of speaking up saying here's gosh

23:17.900 --> 23:23.400
We missed the old one when you kind of broke it in the first place, but Peter Moore wasn't there when EA got

23:23.920 --> 23:25.480
I don't know they move this way

23:25.480 --> 23:28.260
Okay, and I know a lot of people aren't gonna agree with this cuz you know

23:28.260 --> 23:32.980
They haven't gone to e3 and they want to I don't think that they should let the public into e3

23:32.980 --> 23:35.580
Because as it was it was so fucking packed

23:36.700 --> 23:37.700
before

23:37.700 --> 23:42.720
You know adding the public on top of that is gonna be nuts. You're not gonna get anything done

23:42.720 --> 23:46.520
What they need to do is find some happy medium between the old e3 and the new e3

23:46.940 --> 23:49.500
So maybe lacks up the amount of you know

23:49.500 --> 23:56.540
People that they're allowing to be invited these things because I know we can't get invited to fucking e3 anymore because it's just too

23:57.420 --> 24:02.540
Strict but before I mean there was people like, you know, Walmart employees that work on their garden section

24:02.540 --> 24:06.460
Just because Walmart carries video games. They got in the e3, you know weird shit like that

24:06.460 --> 24:10.700
If they can cut down on some of that stuff people that don't actually need to be there

24:10.780 --> 24:12.780
Then I think it would be a little bit better

24:13.260 --> 24:14.580
I

24:14.580 --> 24:16.640
Don't know about adding the public

24:16.640 --> 24:20.140
I think that there's other events that the public can go to if they need to do this kind of stuff

24:20.140 --> 24:24.460
I like the format that they have with the press conferences and stuff because it's a lot easier to digest the information

24:24.580 --> 24:25.680
And you know what?

24:25.680 --> 24:29.220
Maybe it might not be so bad with the press conferences there and actually being able

24:29.220 --> 24:33.940
You know since you're not gonna be able to walk up to a booth and play anything because it's gonna be fucking mobbed

24:33.940 --> 24:37.180
Um, I gotta say this this is very interesting the comments again

24:37.180 --> 24:40.900
I keep quoting Bobby, but he's giving good giving us good stuff tonight Bobby in our chat room and chat

24:40.900 --> 24:43.900
I don't want to come he says Peter Moore loved the community

24:44.180 --> 24:48.940
Microsoft did a lot more for the enthusiasts press last year when Peter Moore was in charge this year

24:48.940 --> 24:53.420
They didn't really care about us as much and it's kind of interesting because Microsoft has always kind of had that very

24:53.580 --> 24:59.060
They're kind of seen amongst the big three, especially as being the ones that are you know way more out there with the community

24:59.060 --> 25:02.700
And everything I mean heck you can get an OLR gamer pic on the Xbox live marketplace

25:02.860 --> 25:08.220
You know that's saying something right there if our crappy little show has representation somehow in the Microsoft world

25:08.220 --> 25:12.400
You know what? I mean? That's you know, it kind of speaks to what Microsoft's doing for the community

25:12.920 --> 25:20.980
Kind of interesting, but you know, I like I said, I just remember when there was like 75,000 people there and how okay

25:20.980 --> 25:25.420
Let's this was the first year that the we I mean it was coming out that same year and that

25:25.420 --> 25:28.980
And that booth was fucking mobbed. It was just impossible

25:28.980 --> 25:33.540
You couldn't walk through it say you wanted to see a game and you finally did see it

25:33.540 --> 25:37.980
You'd take you like 30 minutes just to get out of the booth and it was just awful

25:37.980 --> 25:45.100
And can you imagine adding you'll say I'm not saying double that but can you imagine adding like even another half of that?

25:45.100 --> 25:51.680
I mean, I can't imagine another 20,000 people there just to see this madness it honestly

25:51.680 --> 25:57.820
I don't I think what they just have to do to fix it is don't make it invite only but make it you know

25:57.820 --> 26:04.600
kind of where only folks with business licenses and official type blogs and things like that can get in I think that will

26:04.820 --> 26:09.780
Really open it up to the independent press to get in there and gamers who are really enthusiastic about gaming, you know

26:09.780 --> 26:14.320
Namely us but it does keep out the Walmart Garden Center employees

26:14.380 --> 26:19.900
But I do think there should be room to for actual, you know, the game say I definitely deserve a place in there

26:19.900 --> 26:21.900
But you know somehow

26:22.420 --> 26:26.380
Screening us that it's really only the people that really work with games in these places

26:26.380 --> 26:32.900
I I am actually okay with the GameStop employees of America being with their I do think the types of things that EA if you

26:32.900 --> 26:39.580
I like educated GameStop employees who've played the games and stuff. I think everybody does so why why not invite retail?

26:39.580 --> 26:43.220
It's just a matter of getting what you need out of it because I know it's like some of these years

26:43.220 --> 26:44.420
It's hard to see everything

26:44.420 --> 26:50.760
I think that the way that these do these press conferences definitely helps because in that way you can see

26:50.900 --> 26:55.100
Everything and then you can decide which you need to go see further. I like that

26:55.100 --> 26:57.760
I like that a lot because that works before the gamers days

26:59.100 --> 27:05.140
Digest all the information the publishers can make sure that the people that that they have the information that they want out there

27:05.700 --> 27:08.700
And if they want to you know further show it off, you know

27:08.700 --> 27:14.100
Maybe not necessarily do a game demonstration during the middle of the show because I think that's kind of retarded sometimes

27:14.100 --> 27:19.500
But you know, hey, this game is playable at our booth. Go check it out, you know, or hey, you know

27:19.500 --> 27:23.900
Let's set up some times to come, you know, visit the booth and play the game

27:24.700 --> 27:29.100
All right. Well, let's move on talking about more e3 kind of fallout because obviously, you know

27:29.100 --> 27:31.540
I know it's been a couple weeks now since e3 but

27:31.980 --> 27:35.780
It is one of the highlights in the gaming year and of course Nintendo

27:36.180 --> 27:42.280
Got a lot of flack for their e3 press conference. And what's kind of interesting is that Nintendo has essentially kind of

27:42.280 --> 27:43.840
I

27:43.840 --> 27:50.080
Don't know if you want to say they apologized but they have definitely taken notice at their unpopular reception

27:50.080 --> 27:53.160
In fact Satoru Iwata has made some comments on it this week quote

27:53.160 --> 28:00.240
We are sorry about the media briefings specifically for those who are expecting to see Nintendo show something about Super Mario or Legend of Zelda

28:00.440 --> 28:03.720
If there's any perception that Nintendo is ignoring the core gamers

28:03.720 --> 28:11.040
It's a misunderstanding and we really want to get rid of that misunderstanding by any means so an interesting apology of sorts

28:11.040 --> 28:15.840
But could it just be that folks are just more upset that it seems like these kid

28:16.120 --> 28:19.200
Kid Icarus rumors and other things just weren't to be true

28:19.200 --> 28:26.880
I think or at least now it's just I'm saying because all they showed was games for casual people. I mean, no, I hate, you know

28:27.520 --> 28:33.760
Distinguishing games between casuals and you know the core gamers or whatever because that's the big trendy thing to say nowadays

28:33.760 --> 28:40.640
But seriously Wii music is like an over glorified toy. There's no depth to it whatsoever

28:40.880 --> 28:48.120
It's just crap, but Loki you got a logo for Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Now. That is a hardcore game

28:48.120 --> 28:53.840
That's the thing but a logo Loki exactly, but here's that's that's one thing though that got it got me excited

28:53.840 --> 28:58.080
But they don't actually have to show anything just say hey, we're working on this

28:58.080 --> 29:02.560
I mean look at a couple years ago. They were showing off a video for Mario Kart

29:02.560 --> 29:07.640
Wii it didn't come out for two years after that, you know, same with the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess

29:07.640 --> 29:12.040
They had a really early teaser video for a few years prior to that and everyone got hyped up

29:12.040 --> 29:16.820
Look at what the other companies are doing when Microsoft teases Halo 3 all they have to do is say, you know

29:16.820 --> 29:21.480
You know with that first trailer did not have a lot to do with the you know final product. It was great though

29:21.480 --> 29:26.360
It was epic in the making it showed nothing in the endgame the actual endgame footage

29:26.360 --> 29:31.000
But it was epic and theatrical and it got everybody pumped about Halo 3 even though they came out for a while

29:31.000 --> 29:36.960
Mike a Sony God of War 3, you know that shit ain't coming out for a long time, but they just had to say the name

29:37.240 --> 29:41.440
Here's my thing is I think and I honestly when you see that one chick

29:41.440 --> 29:44.360
I don't remember her name the new one that replaced parent Kaplan or whatever

29:45.080 --> 29:52.080
That's doing her stupid snowboarding shit on on there. I can't honestly believe that she actually plays any games

29:52.080 --> 29:55.760
I mean, I honestly she may play the DS and play the fucking brain-age shit

29:55.760 --> 30:00.400
And she may be like one of those casual gamers, but I can't see her as an actual gamer

30:00.400 --> 30:05.840
but that's the problem those because they don't play these games and they don't necessarily have to play it like a lot of games to

30:05.840 --> 30:08.360
Be it's not their job. It doesn't to make the games

30:08.360 --> 30:13.840
It isn't to make the games but they should be familiar with the product and know how to hype it up for their you know

30:13.840 --> 30:15.840
audience that's what they should do because

30:16.360 --> 30:18.140
It just seemed like you know

30:18.140 --> 30:23.000
She's a buffoon and so they're having her play this game to make it look like look at this

30:23.000 --> 30:29.320
It's a snowboarding game, which is usually more of a hardcore game, but any idiot can play it. So why don't you go play it?

30:29.320 --> 30:32.240
That's the whole thing is making it more of a casual thing

30:33.480 --> 30:38.120
But they didn't have to do that much. They I mean they just said Oh Pokemon. Okay, this is coming out

30:38.120 --> 30:40.540
they could have showed a trailer for that they could have

30:41.320 --> 30:45.000
Showed Wario Land shake there's a perfect example of a game that can you know?

30:45.320 --> 30:49.040
Be for the core gamer and also for more of a casual player

30:49.040 --> 30:52.240
Let me ask let me ask dark soccer because she's been awfully quiet through this

30:52.240 --> 30:54.240
But I'm just kind of curious of your opinion dark soccer

30:54.240 --> 31:01.840
I did Nintendo really make a misstep with this e3 or are we at fault for letting our expectations be too high in the first place?

31:03.680 --> 31:09.600
I'm going to be perfectly honest that I'm very neutral toward the whole thing just because they obviously

31:10.760 --> 31:17.400
address the the things that they felt they needed to address to increase their market because this the whole

31:17.400 --> 31:24.120
Big thing with business is you want to increase your market share. They know if they release a Zelda or a

31:24.960 --> 31:32.760
Mario or whatever that they're going to get their core market. They have their loyal. We're already loyal. They'd be preaching to the choir. I

31:33.760 --> 31:34.960
think

31:34.960 --> 31:38.760
Where it comes in is that if they're trying to convince?

31:39.960 --> 31:43.520
I'm trying to think of the best way to phrase this but they're trying to convince

31:43.520 --> 31:48.120
That's this new market that they're trying to bring in this expanded market that

31:48.800 --> 31:53.600
Doing it in a media centered event where it's going to go out in press

31:54.320 --> 31:58.080
You know, I think that they were smart in doing that

31:58.080 --> 32:01.560
I just think there should have been a little bit more mentioned so that like, you know

32:01.560 --> 32:05.760
Throw us a bone or something, but it's seriously their excuse though for doing this is like we don't have enough time

32:05.760 --> 32:10.440
We don't have enough time during our presentation to make these sorts of announcements and to be honest

32:10.440 --> 32:14.480
I mean their presentation was one of the shorter of the presentations out there and

32:14.760 --> 32:19.400
How long is it really gonna take to say we don't have any video footage to show you right now

32:19.400 --> 32:22.480
But our teams are working on new Mario and a new Zelda game

32:23.920 --> 32:27.040
Realize that we are that we already know they're working on some no

32:27.040 --> 32:33.320
But they don't have to go and make some sort of claim that you know, oh we're doing this when they know

32:33.840 --> 32:35.360
We want to keep these gamers

32:35.360 --> 32:41.480
We're gonna put out this game that goes without saying there's absolutely no reason for them to make an announcement until they have something concrete

32:41.480 --> 32:44.880
To give us but you know what my wife knows that I love her

32:44.880 --> 32:50.680
But she likes to hear it every now one and again, so this is exactly why we have to do this

32:50.680 --> 32:54.000
They they may we may assume that they're doing this stuff

32:54.000 --> 32:57.800
But you know, what if we don't see it enough? We may not assume it anymore

32:57.800 --> 33:03.200
So you're thinking Nintendo doesn't love you anymore Loki. Is that what it is? Yes, I think that exactly I think Nintendo

33:03.200 --> 33:09.480
We need to be cuddled. Okay, we have no more, you know Sega systems yet. We keep getting Sonic games

33:10.040 --> 33:15.520
You know Sega knows of their bread and butter is coming from you know, Nintendo isn't you know, it's

33:16.280 --> 33:21.040
Have succeeded this long. They're obviously not run by a bunch of crayon eating

33:21.680 --> 33:23.760
chained to the jungle gym morons

33:24.480 --> 33:28.160
mmm, no mention name of people but I

33:28.160 --> 33:36.200
I think that when it then they do have they're given a certain amount of time that they can have their press conference and they

33:36.200 --> 33:39.320
Have parameters they have to keep in touch, you know, keep in mind

33:39.320 --> 33:46.000
I think that they were trying to reach a certain market and then once they got that message out

33:46.040 --> 33:52.520
They know that there's other means that they can get the word out to the core gamer that we're going to be a bit more

33:52.520 --> 33:58.480
Curious we're going to look for these things rather than you take the stuff to the mass market

33:58.800 --> 34:04.200
But your core is going to come to you every time but see I want to see if this actually works out for them because

34:04.320 --> 34:10.000
The problem with their core audience that they're targeting right now the mom and pops that bought

34:10.000 --> 34:17.760
You know the Wii system the play Wii Sports now, they're anticipating. Okay. Well, they're gonna buy this Wii Sports Resort thing

34:17.760 --> 34:22.720
I hope that's true because if it's not they're gonna end up with another fucking

34:23.640 --> 34:27.360
Was a big brain Academy game that came out on the Wii and the be honest

34:27.360 --> 34:28.120
No one bought it

34:28.120 --> 34:32.760
So there are they have had a lot of missteps in the casual market because they don't underestimate

34:32.760 --> 34:37.240
I don't think they really know who they're trying to target. All right, let me let me just summarize here

34:37.240 --> 34:40.920
I think all we want is that Reggie all we want is a cuddle

34:41.280 --> 34:46.140
But you know my thing and I think it's kind of like, you know, if a Zelda game is in development, you know

34:46.140 --> 34:49.200
Yes, we all know it's in development, but kind of throw us a frickin bone

34:49.200 --> 34:51.680
Like for instance if we know that in the new Zelda game

34:52.240 --> 34:58.620
Link is gonna ride a gigantic spider then like show us the image of link riding a giant spider and you know

34:58.620 --> 35:02.800
Put out there link and the giant spider friend coming next fall

35:02.800 --> 35:07.700
You know give us something to and then all the Nintendo fanboys can run around with their giant boners and go

35:07.700 --> 35:09.940
Oh my god. Did you see the giant spider?

35:10.740 --> 35:15.180
Exactly. That's all they have to do. Look at Mario Kart. Like I said, this is a perfect example Mario Kart

35:15.180 --> 35:22.140
They showed a CG trailer that showed Mario in a cart racing around. That was it. Nothing from the game

35:22.400 --> 35:24.220
No graphics whatsoever

35:24.220 --> 35:29.560
It was just a CG trailer to get people hyped up that oh my god Mario Kart's coming and it's not like that

35:29.560 --> 35:34.180
We didn't see Mario Kart coming because it's been on almost every single Nintendo system. So

35:34.860 --> 35:40.780
but still that got people excited and gave them something to anticipate another Mario game I

35:40.780 --> 35:45.600
For all I know it could be a crappy and you know, this is gonna come anyways

35:45.620 --> 35:50.300
We're like Mario Tennis or Mario Golf and but once again, that's not a hardcore game

35:50.300 --> 35:57.600
That's a game targeting those same people that bought fucking we to play we sports stop catering the people that play Wii Sports

35:58.100 --> 36:02.020
There are other games out there. They sold their systems didn't they true? Yeah, that's true

36:02.020 --> 36:05.060
We you know what we would not be selling the way it is if it weren't for Wii Sports

36:05.060 --> 36:09.700
I think a Wii Sports sequel was an inevitability just a one little thing. Yeah, this is where it comes down to

36:09.700 --> 36:13.560
Bottom line money. What company is out there?

36:14.300 --> 36:21.220
You know if they were out there too, I guess be nice and sweet and cuddly that'd be you know, a not-for-profit

36:22.140 --> 36:23.380
organization

36:23.380 --> 36:27.540
As it is there they have to make money

36:28.180 --> 36:32.580
What's the nice way for Nintendo to tell the teenagers of America? Your mom has more money than you do

36:32.580 --> 36:42.380
Um, well, we've done selective targeting for certain products and we feel that the adult demographic would be

36:43.100 --> 36:48.660
Okay, go ahead. Okay. I want to say there's a shower and in chat. It's great. He has a title for my new Zelda game

36:48.660 --> 36:50.900
It's called Legend of Zelda web of lies

36:52.100 --> 36:57.140
All right. Well what I was trying to say before is it you know, they probably see something. Oh well

36:57.140 --> 37:03.780
To expand our market we're going to appeal to a different demographic for aiming towards the older people who might have been our core

37:03.860 --> 37:09.820
Group at a younger age. We're trying to reclaim the market that is now quote grown out of video games

37:09.980 --> 37:15.780
You should you need to go get a job. Why do you think I was in technical writing for a while?

37:15.780 --> 37:18.340
Very nice. All right, Loki final. Okay, then we get him my final thought

37:19.380 --> 37:23.540
Basically, it's like this. Okay. It's a good idea for them to try to expand their market

37:23.540 --> 37:27.620
The problem is though is bringing these people into the gaming market isn't gonna necessarily

37:27.940 --> 37:32.500
Do a lot of good for you. The problem is you got to get people confident in your platform because

37:33.300 --> 37:41.580
Come five years from now when you're releasing your next Nintendo system and Microsoft's releasing their next Xbox system and the PlayStation with the PlayStation 4

37:43.980 --> 37:48.380
You're not gonna have a lot of people, you know wanting to buy your next system because

37:48.380 --> 37:53.780
They bought the Wii and that's all they play is Wii Sports. So why do they need to buy your next system?

37:53.780 --> 37:57.620
That's the problem. And if you cater these people that are just casual gamers

37:58.060 --> 38:03.440
They're not gonna come back for more. In fact when you have people buying that your next Nintendo system

38:03.440 --> 38:05.380
They may not buy your next Nintendo system

38:05.380 --> 38:09.700
They may just go somewhere else and that's where you're gonna end up hurting. It's down later on

38:09.700 --> 38:14.020
I don't often get a chance to acknowledge the Justin TVers because there's so many chat rooms for us to read

38:14.020 --> 38:17.660
But I just took a peek in there and one thing I thought that was pretty funny that they're talking about it in there

38:17.660 --> 38:21.460
Some folks are saying a Pokemon MMO is what's needed

38:22.340 --> 38:25.580
Could be interesting. I mean Pokemon sure is one of those

38:26.180 --> 38:32.340
Universal franchises that sells like, you know, it's free money, but MMO on a Wii would be very interesting

38:32.340 --> 38:36.380
That would be very easy to do actually if you think about it. I think so too. Because I mean, alright for example

38:36.380 --> 38:37.940
I can't believe it hasn't already happened

38:37.940 --> 38:44.780
Well for an example, um, actually a lot of custom servers for Ragnarok online have a Pokeball system where you can actually capture

38:45.740 --> 38:47.140
your

38:47.140 --> 38:51.100
Different creatures as your pets and then once they become loyal they help you fight

38:51.100 --> 38:55.220
I don't think it would be that much harder to do something centered around going out and actually cat

38:55.220 --> 38:57.780
You know if they can do it on a regular video game

38:57.780 --> 39:03.620
Why can't they have it in multiplayer format and then you have like for example, like you have your arena system

39:03.620 --> 39:09.180
You can actually have your gyms be set up that way, you know, and you've got whoever you know

39:09.180 --> 39:12.980
It was like has the best group or whatever. So you have a continuously

39:12.980 --> 39:19.340
A rotating list and like maybe your gym leaders like one of the GM's or something. All right. Anyhow. Anyhow, let's move on

39:19.340 --> 39:24.860
It's a very very I know you have more Nintendo news, but hey stuff about Reggie, okay

39:25.700 --> 39:28.140
Reggie is like, okay

39:28.140 --> 39:35.100
we know pretty much said from an America centric perspective to quote that the

39:35.100 --> 39:43.100
Weezer storage capacity is a big problem over here because we like we wear in virtual console and he told

39:43.300 --> 39:49.780
MTV that there is an urgency to find a storage solution. So he says that Nintendo is working on something

39:49.980 --> 39:55.420
They are not ready to tell us what they are working on, but they are working on something but I

39:57.620 --> 39:58.900
Actually

39:58.900 --> 40:04.900
Think that they're gonna and while it wouldn't be hard to do something USB based at knowing Nintendo

40:04.900 --> 40:11.660
They're going to try to do something proprietary something that can't be mimicked something that no one's gonna be able in theory

40:11.660 --> 40:16.940
No one's going to be able to break and just you know hack their own like, you know

40:16.940 --> 40:22.860
We used to do on the old PlayStation hard drives. Remember? Yeah, they're going to try to do something

40:22.860 --> 40:28.020
That's that they would have control over. It's just frustrating though because they put USB slots

40:28.020 --> 40:32.500
They put SD card slots in that we why does it have to be freaking proprietary?

40:32.500 --> 40:37.300
You know like it by doing that it kind of showed the promise of Oh mass storage

40:37.300 --> 40:43.580
Hey good idea, and it's not being used. I guarantee you it won't be proprietary and I guarantee you be something really simple

40:43.580 --> 40:48.340
It could be done right now, but they're gonna drag their fucking feet until it gets done

40:48.340 --> 40:54.420
It's gonna be some stupid USB hard drive thing. Just open up USB to use storage devices

40:54.420 --> 40:59.100
Your problem solved right there. It only takes one firmware update and you're no longer

40:59.100 --> 41:04.540
I mean, it's no different than it is gonna make from that. I'm sorry. Where's the money for them to make from that?

41:04.540 --> 41:08.060
Oh, you don't have to make money off everything show Nintendo USB drives

41:08.860 --> 41:15.780
That they'll release in stores along with that for ten dollars more than the generic brands will cause I still think they're gonna have some

41:15.780 --> 41:18.740
Way to system lock and even if they do it via USB

41:18.780 --> 41:22.060
they're gonna have some sort of code that you have to read off of the

41:23.020 --> 41:29.080
The storage device so that it recognizes it as Nintendo only I think they're nervous about people using the USB thing

41:29.080 --> 41:32.700
To hack the system. I think I seriously think what it is. So you that's why it's

41:34.420 --> 41:35.500
Investment

41:35.500 --> 41:37.140
From a business perspective

41:37.140 --> 41:43.060
They're not going to want to leave it open for anyone else to profit off of or to take money out of their power

41:43.060 --> 41:48.980
Let's think of how retarded it was in the first place that they only put half a gig of storage space on their stupid system

41:48.980 --> 41:53.380
Well, they were aiming for a certain price for their system. I mean, but they're paying for it now

41:53.380 --> 41:58.020
Now the gamers are like now it's kind of like they put the cart before the whole horse with this whole we wear thing

41:58.020 --> 42:02.780
Oh great. They're filling up that drive. I can't wait for the special dog and no dongle the attachment

42:02.780 --> 42:05.700
It's gonna attach to as well that's gonna give it high-def graphics

42:05.700 --> 42:12.380
Oh, maybe we'll get someone that you know, gives us some good online or maybe I don't know one that gives us some better games

42:13.140 --> 42:16.300
Nintendo is the pro at aftermarket upgrades

42:17.100 --> 42:21.900
As I mean think about it. I bet you any this is this is my prediction

42:21.900 --> 42:22.260
Okay

42:22.260 --> 42:29.140
We're going to get a hard drive unit of some variety that is going to fit in with the Wii it's either going to run

42:29.140 --> 42:32.180
Off of USB or have some sort of it

42:32.340 --> 42:38.020
Either way, there's going to be some sort of lockout on it so that you can only use the Nintendo storage

42:38.020 --> 42:45.220
Whatever with the Wii and then as it progresses we're going to get like the Wii Deluxe or something, you know

42:45.220 --> 42:51.820
Maybe the you know new upgrade they drop the price the old we bring out the new we at the rigor price of storage becomes

42:51.820 --> 42:57.180
You know even more cheap as the you know, time goes by and we're going to get a new Nintendo

42:57.180 --> 43:01.660
Yeah, that's why I understand they can't do that now because the price of flash storage has gone down so much

43:01.660 --> 43:07.060
They could just say okay going forward now all the ways that we put out are gonna have four gigs of storage instead

43:07.060 --> 43:10.060
Yeah, I'll piss off a lot of people but you know what tough

43:11.780 --> 43:14.020
All right, I'm was at least

43:14.620 --> 43:17.820
There the Reggie admits the problem is out there

43:17.820 --> 43:23.140
Even if he used a very politically correct kind of term to do that the whole American centric perspective

43:23.340 --> 43:26.020
At least they they are finally admitting there's a problem

43:26.020 --> 43:30.580
Well, I think that he's probably looking at where the majority of the complaint has come from

43:30.980 --> 43:36.220
Has been and this is at least as far as I've seen to has been mostly the American market

43:36.220 --> 43:40.260
So I think he's saying well at least Nintendo of America loves you

43:41.940 --> 43:46.780
It's our cuddle Rob interesting I guess maybe that was our cuddle, I don't know we'll see

43:46.780 --> 43:48.220
Oh

43:48.220 --> 43:52.420
Smack him in the fucking face. Seriously. Oh, yeah, we acknowledge there's a problem now

43:52.420 --> 43:55.780
Oh, I'm glad you finally jumped on board with that. He needs a little love

43:55.820 --> 44:00.940
Would he be so angry if somebody would oh, I can't wait to interview some of these people. Oh, that would be awesome

44:00.940 --> 44:07.700
I think that Loki needs something that starts with the D and ends with the E and there's two words. It's called duct tape

44:09.260 --> 44:15.040
Loki on my own. Yeah, my only wish is that you know, you take your little media badge at this event

44:15.040 --> 44:19.580
This is Orange Lounge radio and you put a sticker over it. This is Bobby Black Wolf show before you go

44:20.500 --> 44:22.500
people

44:22.500 --> 44:24.500
I'll take it a step further. I'll put my name is

44:25.180 --> 44:32.340
Someone follow follow around and once you hit that just borderline breaking, but we'll be like, okay interviews over next ding-ding-ding-ding-ding

44:33.060 --> 44:38.940
So speaking of newest Rob you would you would love it if I just like put on a mask and like dress up like Captain

44:38.940 --> 44:40.940
Anger or something

44:40.940 --> 44:45.020
You could be mr. Furious mr. Furious. All right, let's move on

44:46.340 --> 44:50.180
Apparently because of a certain patent lawsuit that Nintendo is facing

44:50.700 --> 44:57.020
That certain Nintendo peripherals are actually going to be or could be pulled from market

44:57.300 --> 45:04.540
These would include any a Nintendo controller that has dual analog sticks. So any of your classic controllers

45:04.540 --> 45:10.420
your GameCube controllers those are going to be taken from the market and

45:13.060 --> 45:20.220
Of course the Wii remote and nunchuck are okay because it was only have one analog stick and this is all because of that

45:20.700 --> 45:22.540
wonderful

45:22.540 --> 45:30.860
21 million dollar patent infringement verdict that was brought up on the company because of the patent holder and escape

45:30.860 --> 45:36.540
That has sued them and you know, it's time for Nintendo to pay their money

45:37.700 --> 45:39.700
or licensing rights

45:40.860 --> 45:47.460
Do you think it's actually gonna happen I don't know it it's well, I mean they have to pay them because it

45:48.460 --> 45:50.460
You know, the verdict has been placed

45:50.720 --> 45:54.520
The thing is though there's well second level appeals room court appeal

45:54.520 --> 46:01.120
Well escape is basically saying that Nintendo has clogged the channel and they're looking to make

46:02.680 --> 46:06.060
Controllers, I guess I don't honestly think that they're gonna try to make controllers

46:06.060 --> 46:08.120
I think that there's money would have kind of done it by now

46:08.800 --> 46:15.660
Yeah, Lord. Katsu. Hito says Nintendo will settle out of court in chat dot orange hundred calm probably most likely

46:15.660 --> 46:17.660
It's usually the way these things go

46:18.520 --> 46:20.020
Anyways

46:20.020 --> 46:26.520
Nintendo is going to be debuting the Wii bonus content feature very soon over in Japan

46:26.760 --> 46:34.140
It's actually a new little feature that they put in a 16 digit code into this bonus thing and you get a new

46:34.660 --> 46:40.920
Present so to speak the Wii speaker channel is the first thing that's supposed to be used using this

46:41.640 --> 46:44.520
It's coming with that, you know that game on the Nintendo DS

46:44.520 --> 46:48.580
I think we talked about it a few weeks ago that it's kind of like using the speakers so you can do the audio

46:48.580 --> 46:50.580
translation of channels or whatever

46:51.500 --> 46:58.140
Interesting, but there's also further speculation going on that possibly these codes could be used for we points

46:58.780 --> 47:06.740
free download games virtual console sell it and sell virtual console games in stores kind of like what Xbox Live does with their

47:06.740 --> 47:12.580
Own redemption system like you can buy Uno or Texas hold them like in a store on a card and give it as a gift

47:13.460 --> 47:15.460
So I don't think that's what this is for. I

47:16.060 --> 47:18.060
Think if it even comes out here

47:18.060 --> 47:22.660
Yes, and I think this the only thing this is it's to deter piracy

47:23.340 --> 47:27.860
Because then you get some bonus with it and you can only get that if you buy the game legitimately

47:29.940 --> 47:35.420
Ironically enough though all those bonus things that they're talking about like the Wii speaker channel leaked to the internet anyways

47:35.420 --> 47:37.420
So it's not gonna matter

47:39.380 --> 47:41.380
Well, there is a

47:41.780 --> 47:44.780
Something that I think is gonna be very very very

47:44.780 --> 47:48.940
Cool to come out at least in Japan, and I don't think we're gonna get it here

47:49.860 --> 47:56.500
But when I first looked at it, I thought it was like the purika the print club stuff, but it's actually not quite

47:56.500 --> 48:04.340
It's called the digi cam print channel. That's going to be on the Wii. It's actually a collaboration with Fujifilm where

48:05.820 --> 48:11.140
You upload your digital pictures by using the SD slot and

48:11.140 --> 48:19.100
You can actually get them printed out and sent to you through Fujifilm and they give you a photo book. That's

48:21.580 --> 48:23.020
1575 yen

48:23.020 --> 48:25.180
Or you can get a Mario one. That's

48:25.820 --> 48:27.260
2480

48:27.260 --> 48:32.560
And you can actually even have them print it out to well you can

48:33.340 --> 48:38.120
Have your meshi printed out which is a Japanese business card you hit it's like your name card, basically

48:38.120 --> 48:44.040
You know the the thing is that when you introduce yourself to somebody you give them your card with your name on it

48:44.040 --> 48:48.640
Mm-hmm, but you can have your meshi with your Wii on it and you've got your Wii be your me on it for

48:49.720 --> 48:52.680
500 yen for 30 cards, so it's actually pretty cool

48:52.680 --> 48:57.040
I wish we could get something like this would it put my 99 digit friend code for every game

48:57.040 --> 48:59.040
I have on those cards, too. I

49:00.240 --> 49:04.400
Don't see why not I mean I would think so that actually would be a very smart idea

49:04.400 --> 49:08.880
To have you know your your friend could be both you and I need to be working at Nintendo

49:08.880 --> 49:11.400
But I'll tell you what and the good idea department

49:11.400 --> 49:15.280
And I'm gonna link this in the chat room because the article I read the video is down

49:15.280 --> 49:18.280
but the promotional trailer for it is on YouTube and

49:18.800 --> 49:22.640
I'm looking at it. It's actually pretty pretty cool. This is actually a

49:23.680 --> 49:26.160
Fujifilm's demo showing how it works

49:26.160 --> 49:31.760
And it's it's really really such a neat idea because you can have them printed out in different sizes and shapes

49:31.760 --> 49:33.960
And have messages on them

49:33.960 --> 49:38.720
It's actually very cool and also send them to to people it seems pretty cool

49:38.720 --> 49:43.640
What I'm seeing on this do you think it's something that would work here, or is this is this better for Japan's culture?

49:43.640 --> 49:45.720
I think it is it's more

49:47.560 --> 49:54.740
Surrounded around I would say how Japanese culture works, but I think that it could be marketable here if they do it right

49:55.260 --> 49:58.320
Why not I mean if the channel already exists?

49:58.320 --> 50:04.520
It's just translation and and on Fujifilm's end you know or whatever company they partnered with in America

50:04.720 --> 50:06.720
Just a matter of you know

50:07.480 --> 50:08.960
I was gonna say Fujifilm's here

50:08.960 --> 50:14.460
So why not fish as long as they have a presence of getting the oh is that are they behind snapfish?

50:14.460 --> 50:20.660
I don't know. Oh, I'm mentioning snapfish every you know every photo company has had to evolve to maintain

50:20.660 --> 50:27.280
Competition with the digital photography, so I'm sure they have something set up the way that I see this is that if

50:29.700 --> 50:36.460
If like say you know rock bands are going through rock band to you know have their musical presence

50:37.340 --> 50:44.660
Fortified in the industry when you know everything is digital download and all that then why can't you know the photo companies make use of?

50:44.660 --> 50:46.660
This I think it's a good idea

50:46.660 --> 50:53.980
And on top of that is it's convenient instead of having to take you know a CD in to have it printed

50:53.980 --> 50:58.940
Or do it yourself. You just be no pay 15 bucks and have them send you a photo album with everything in it

51:00.100 --> 51:05.100
Game guru in chat says damn sooner or later. They will fill the Wii with just channels kind of

51:06.260 --> 51:09.980
Kind of a good point because you know the Wii only has four screens worth of channels

51:09.980 --> 51:13.360
I want the channel channel the channel channel the change channel channel

51:13.360 --> 51:18.760
Now as unfortunately as they're not going to be able to fill it full of channels because there's not a space on the storage to

51:18.760 --> 51:20.680
Store all those channels

51:20.680 --> 51:22.160
Yeah

51:22.160 --> 51:27.480
Alpha Kananagrams in chat says this needs to come to America ASAP big fan of the whole

51:27.920 --> 51:30.880
Fuji film channel idea all right. We will see

51:31.720 --> 51:35.100
Well, this isn't for the Wii, but it uses the Wii remotes

51:35.240 --> 51:39.840
there is a brand new homebrew game made called dark room sex game and

51:39.840 --> 51:46.880
what this basically is is two people will take the Wii remotes, and they will kind of make a

51:47.920 --> 51:52.760
kind of like a hammer motion with it basically shaking the remote in time with the

51:53.760 --> 51:56.880
Pornographic sounds there's no images. It's just all audio

51:57.440 --> 52:04.880
That you hear on the screen, and you're supposed to do it in rhythm and then eventually kind of speed up to a finish

52:04.880 --> 52:07.500
this sounds like a minigame in Mario Party 8 I

52:07.500 --> 52:09.060
I

52:09.060 --> 52:11.500
Wish I had brought my bluetooth

52:12.500 --> 52:15.100
Adapter next week though we can maybe do this on the show

52:15.740 --> 52:17.220
You know for that

52:17.220 --> 52:20.420
For that extra. It's all audio array. It'll be awesome

52:20.940 --> 52:25.340
All right, yeah gold banjo pretty much sums up my thoughts in chat weirdest homebrew ever

52:25.460 --> 52:30.760
But it is for the PC, and it is available to download out there. I believe they have a

52:32.500 --> 52:34.100
It's a

52:34.100 --> 52:36.100
website itu.dk

52:36.100 --> 52:39.300
slash stud slash darkroom is

52:43.420 --> 52:50.020
Right and game grew in chat says the kind of obvious comment here. Why not you know have sex

52:51.420 --> 52:57.380
Because this is this is safer. You can't can't contract babies or a okay. I see

52:59.060 --> 53:02.600
AIDS and baby free I get it, so there's there's I guess the

53:02.600 --> 53:09.360
Positive unless you're using those remotes with those other attachments that they had in which case you could probably you yeah

53:10.280 --> 53:12.280
You might be able to get genital herpes

53:13.160 --> 53:16.860
Herpes maybe using the proper now make it a gear attachments

53:17.520 --> 53:22.980
All right, well, please let's change the topic real quick here. I have them and talk about, Castlevania

53:23.840 --> 53:25.520
Because Castlevania is pretty awesome

53:25.520 --> 53:32.840
Castlevania why Castlevania has to follow a story about a sex game is because Castlevania is sex I mean Castlevania is that good and I

53:32.840 --> 53:36.640
Had no idea this was coming, but apparently there's a Castlevania arcade game

53:36.640 --> 53:42.680
Akumajo Dracula the arcade and there's been some location tests going on over in Japan and

53:43.240 --> 53:46.240
Some folks are already kind of leaking their opinions to the internet

53:46.920 --> 53:51.720
Apparently you can actually enter the machine from one side or the other. There's a pretty spacious inside and

53:51.720 --> 53:57.320
There was LED lit candles on the inside of the machine which I think is kind of cool

53:57.600 --> 54:03.320
You hold a controller that's shaped like the handle of a whip and the top of the whip also has LEDs in it

54:03.720 --> 54:06.560
First player has blue one second player gets dark pink ones

54:07.080 --> 54:13.600
And then you have a little yellow trigger on the whip where your index finger goes and that is for sub weapons like knives

54:13.780 --> 54:17.760
Crosses potions all of that stuff, and then there's another button where your thumb is

54:18.520 --> 54:20.200
so apparently

54:20.200 --> 54:22.760
And that thumb button is used for items later in the game

54:23.200 --> 54:27.760
You stand in a designated spot you aim your controller to kind of calibrate the game

54:27.760 --> 54:34.120
I guess it's using like kind of those mocap things and then you're in this outside area and then skeletons start coming out

54:34.120 --> 54:38.640
And they'll start shooting arrows at you and you can swing your whip or throw knives at them

54:38.920 --> 54:43.960
So that's kind of neat and then of course the weapons like knives. They do take hearts. Just like the game

54:43.960 --> 54:48.140
That's like 25 heart, so it sounds like a shooting game with like a Castlevania twist on it

54:48.140 --> 54:50.280
So it sounds like this will be coming to the Wii

54:50.960 --> 54:55.480
Possibly there's rumors that the Silent Hill arcade game is going to come to the Wii rumors I

54:56.780 --> 55:00.280
Think that there's more than one way to do it too. It doesn't necessarily have to be we only

55:00.920 --> 55:04.880
This sounds neat in theory though. It does and it sounds pretty cool speaking of Silent Hill

55:04.880 --> 55:10.680
I forgot to mention this during my gaming week, but the Silent Hill movie is right now. I know Comcast is nationwide

55:10.680 --> 55:15.400
I don't know if they're on demand thing is nationwide, but Silent Hill is right now in the on demand in HD

55:15.400 --> 55:21.840
For free on Comcast on demand so I actually watched it this weekend with William and and he well

55:21.840 --> 55:24.400
He'd seen it once in a theater, but he said he didn't understand it at all

55:24.400 --> 55:28.760
He needed me to explain it to him so we watched it, and I did but I'll tell you what Silent Hill in HD

55:29.560 --> 55:31.280
very very hot

55:31.280 --> 55:33.480
Sweet is very good-looking movie

55:33.480 --> 55:36.400
And I I still like Silent Hill as a movie

55:36.400 --> 55:40.320
And I hope that I hope the rumors of the sequel are true that they are doing it. I hope so, too

55:40.320 --> 55:47.760
Okay, well how about some release dates Rob? How about it? Well for the 30th in the UK?

55:47.760 --> 55:51.000

57:31.580 --> 57:35.780
Yeah, and if you don't want to play a fighting game spectral force 3 looks like a pretty good role-playing game

57:35.780 --> 57:40.860
So there you go a very similar story over in Japan doing the Japanese release date

57:40.860 --> 57:46.280
So we also have Soulcalibur 4 being a big presence in the Xbox 360 this week in Japan being released on the 31st of July

57:46.280 --> 57:51.880
Also a special fighting stick is coming out from Hori to kind of commemorate Soulcalibur 4

57:52.520 --> 57:58.400
Beijing Olympics 2008 also coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan going over to the PlayStation 3

57:58.400 --> 58:05.040
they're also getting Soulcalibur 4 of course on the 31st, and they are also getting the special fighting stick as well and

58:05.680 --> 58:10.360
If you want Beijing Olympics 2008 on PlayStation 3 guess what here you go

58:10.360 --> 58:14.720
It's coming out in Japan this week now going over the Nintendo Wii not a lot of games

58:14.720 --> 58:19.200
I've heard of before but they do have a Dokapon Kingdom for Wii is coming out on on

58:19.720 --> 58:25.280
the 31st as well as Wii de Tokotan Kanji noo is coming out as well and

58:25.760 --> 58:29.400
Zero Gesu no Kamen comes out as well this week

58:29.400 --> 58:34.240
And that game looks to be like a little bit of a survivor horror type game. So this game actually looks kind of cool

58:35.640 --> 58:40.640
Kind of looking at some of the CG from the game. It's like crazy Fatal Frame 4. Is that what this is?

58:40.640 --> 58:43.000
Yeah, ah, it's their version of Fatal Frame 4

58:43.000 --> 58:44.200
very

58:44.200 --> 58:49.760
Cool. I was gonna say that Dokapon Kingdom. That's that party game from Atlas the one that's

58:50.360 --> 58:53.600
Promising that you'll ruin your friendship with your friends if you play it

58:54.440 --> 59:00.360
Really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It was on Mario Party type game. Yeah. What about this other one since we looked at the other two

59:00.880 --> 59:03.960
Wii de Tokotan Kanji noo looks like I

59:04.960 --> 59:09.360
Think it's like a it looks like one of those 200 in game 250 games in a game type thing

59:09.360 --> 59:12.960
It looks a little weird. All right, probably not so many people going over that

59:13.640 --> 59:17.880
Other systems, let's go to the handheld systems to see what's coming out in Japan. I'm sorry first PlayStation 2

59:18.400 --> 59:22.880
Drastic Killer comes out this week Galaxy Angel 2, Gino Express

59:23.400 --> 59:24.960
Hoshifuru

59:24.960 --> 59:31.880
Kanokan Isui all come out this week on the PlayStation 2 going over to the handhelds and looking at what's coming out there

59:31.880 --> 59:40.000
Quite a bit Dream Baseball on the DS comes out as well Dokapon Journey also on the Nintendo DS

59:40.520 --> 59:44.880
Doki Doki Module Shinpan 2 comes out as well as SNK

59:45.280 --> 59:50.600
What that's the one where you you fondle the the girls. It's oh my god

59:52.040 --> 59:54.600
Wow, they actually made a sequel that look at that

59:54.600 --> 59:58.720
The top screen is her face and the bottom screen is her boobies on the DS there

59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.640
That's a Doki Doki Module Shinpan 2 all in the name of fighting witches. Yes

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.540
Also coming out Rhythm Tenku Gold comes out this week on the DS Steel Princess

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.760
Tozoku Ojou

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:17.920
Windy Cross Windom comes out as well lots and lots of DS releases this week PSP

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.280
Looking at those releases a little bit going on over there as well fantasy star portable being the most notable of the releases in Japan

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:31.880
This week Panic Palette portable and Giga Ojou Somo Denotsu Collection

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:38.360
Oh Joe Soma. Yeah, it's the PC Engine best collection. It's a PC Engine best collection

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.360
It's three PC Engine games

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.760
I'm not sure what games they are. That looks familiar. I just don't know what that is. They're

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.940
I'm a chick fighting. Yeah, it looks very familiar something

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:54.880
I don't know if it's come out or coming out though that I want from overseas. Hmm. What's that? That's um, the uh, a

01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.140
Fantasy zone collection. I think we've covered it before they're shooters. Just you know, yeah

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.120
That's really familiar. I probably have a couple of them

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.840
All right. Well, there you have it your Japanese release dates busy week, especially on the handhelds in Japan

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.080
well, um

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:16.840
speaking of other busy events is that um, there has been a little um, I

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.560
guess

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:24.360
Controversy regarding a lack of halo information from what I understand the e3

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:34.540
But they actually were saying that halo is so big that it would probably need its own event or to quote

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.440
Big enough at this point that it can stand on its own

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:43.120
so there are a few hints going around and they've mentioned comic-con and

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.280
other

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.360
Conventions that there might be a halo con. In fact, um

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.600
Let me go see if I can't get this

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.360
name

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.460
Just we need another damn convention more plane tickets to buy

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880
well, um

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:09.560
But it was I guess one of the the higher-ups saying that you can do a halo con

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:15.280
Nothing on the scale of comic-con, but you could bring a few hundred people to see a halo thing

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:21.000
If there were a Microsoft and bungee endorse like halo tournament uber thing. I bet I bet people would come

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.280
It depends where they have it Rob. I'd go

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.960
It won't wait. It would depend on where they have it. I'd go

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.200
I mean, I wouldn't buy another plane ticket to Seattle to go do it

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.040
But if they did in San Francisco, I'd drive maybe even la heck. Yeah, who knows?

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:41.540
Well, halo con possibly coming soon. I see kidnapped the press to bring him to that. You know

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.120
Scared the crap out of them. Let's be fun cosplay Master Chief

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:52.520
You think there'd be Master Chief cosplay halo con I would hope and Cortana and all your favorite and people dress up like Star Wars

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:58.400
Characters because there's always the Star Wars cosplayers no matter what the convention is. I don't know why

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.280
In fact someday when we have a well our con, you know some way it was some day way in the way in the future

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.120
We encourage people to come as Star Wars cosplayers

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.920
Yeah, because um, well Microsoft has actually made a games for Windows lives free for all

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.000
Maybe because the service didn't really I don't know

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.440
Fulfill what it's promised to be really take off. Yeah, it kind of

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:32.400
Didn't necessarily meet a kind of butter. But anyways, um, so yes, if you did pay for it already they are refunding your money and

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:40.520
it is effective immediately that games such as like Halo 2 and shadowrun and all future releases are free to play and

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.880
Actually, I heard another interesting rumor 3 is awesome, I think you're thinking the same thing I am what did you hear

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.880
I heard the rumor that

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:56.640
the games that are cross-platform enabled like shadowrun and

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.640
I want to say there was another one lost planet

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:09.380
Those if you have an Xbox 360 version of you can play those multiplayer on a silver account now and then

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.800
away

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.800
to more

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.960
Things possibly a foot in the door to a free online play on Xbox. That could be very interesting

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:24.440
We'll see is it because it's probably just competition from things like steam and other products that exist, you know out there all these kind of

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.560
competing

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.400
Portals for games on PC so to speak. It's lost planet colonies, by the way, that's multi-platform

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.160
Yeah, according to act deft and chat

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.680
Well, I like free so that's pretty cool. Except, you know, what did you hear play Halo on the computer the same thing?

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:45.400
Okay, that the silver accounts on Xbox live were able to play some of the games that were kind of impacted by this a little bit

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.280
One game I'm excited about when it comes to Xbox live in the future

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.040
Which by the way, it's not just coming to Xbox live supposed to be on PlayStation Network and Nintendo

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.840
We wear Mega Man 9 who is not excited about Mega Man 9 what you?

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.480
Get off my show. No, I'm just kidding

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.880
This this Mega Man 9 looks great

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:07.880
And I think it's cute that they're kind of going the extra mile with the retro goodness of this and an e3 some Mega Man 9

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:13.880
Box art t-shirts were spotted and it is the same classic cheesy box art

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:18.360
with Mega Man having the human head and everything like the Mega Man 2 box art, you know

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.520
It's like somebody happily great someone in Capcom got the joke. Yeah in other words

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:28.600
Well, they are actually releasing those as actual t-shirts according to a Capcom official blog

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:33.640
Capcom's marketing team in the US is super stoked that everyone is getting what we're doing with the box art

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:39.880
Including the Japanese development team and I promise you that we'll have some t-shirts of this beauty available for purchase soon

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.800
Awesome. Did you see the other one that they put out? Well, it wasn't them, but it was some other

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.400
Meatbun.com I think it was what it was. No, it was the

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.360
1942

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:56.040
Pinup girl thing with cami that shirt. Oh, I saw that not as funny. I ordered one

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.800
Did you you would I need new teeth. That was the other game. I played on Xbox live this week

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:04.920
I didn't even talk about 1942 now. That's how you remake a retro game for Xbox live

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.880
That's all I have to say that was I only played on Xbox live

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.440
That's all I have to say that was I only played the demo

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.520
But I was I was much more impressed with that than any other classic 80s game port

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.560
I have in a long time other than maybe pac-man championship edition

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:23.720
so just check that out if you were if you've been overlooking it because you're burned out on retro arcade releases because

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.360
1942 was pretty awesome. I gotta say

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.560
I like uh, the 19. What was the 1942 kai? That was a good one

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:36.600
But I want to see the the 1940 xx ones remade. Wouldn't that be cool? That would be really sweet

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.600
but um

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:46.620
Going back to the whole retro side of thing is that um, there's a hint that um, Igarashi is planning on doing a new castlevania

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.320
in 2d

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:53.480
For we on we wear that's going to be pretty cool. Um

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.640
It's uh supposed to be um

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.960
Trying to get back the interest into the original feel of the castlevania series

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.120
so, um

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.600
He says that he's gonna um pay attention to how a mega man 9

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.720
Uh is with the market and base his decision on that. So that's that's smart

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:21.320
I like this trend mega man 9 seems to be starting. Yeah, this could be very good

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.400
I think it's like, you know, it would also be very bad

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.760
We love our 2d but no one wants to really admit it in the 3d market until someone just says ah screw it

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:33.000
We're doing it anyway, and they're like, hey, they're making money on this

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.640
I don't think safe for very little money into it. You know, let's do it

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.280
I don't think anyone ever said that, you know, they didn't like it. I just don't understand why they don't

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.840
Why more people haven't been doing 2d games they sell just as well

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.400
People people are sucked in by 3d

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:55.000
I think someone figured out where to touch that retro nerve and that was capcom with the the mega man and now they got people

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.080
Excited now the other companies are going huh?

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:04.440
Could could we make money too could could retro goodness be a money-making machine now the problem it hopefully just the pool doesn't get diluted

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.680
Because then you'll see these other retro games that people aren't even going to care about and it's going to ruin everything

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:15.560
I don't know. I think it's a lot harder for them to go back and actually remake something because that means actually have to work on it

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.720
you know versus

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.480
I don't know just like hoarding something from like the playstation 2 or the gamecube

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.720
true

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.240
true

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.240
this is something that's pretty exciting and

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.800
I don't know why i'm excited about it since I you know up until a couple weeks ago

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.800
Didn't know what the hell the watchman was

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.840
Um, I knew it was a comic book series, but I haven't read it

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.200
Although I am interested in reading it now. But anyways, um at comic con they announced that they're going to be making

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.100
Um watchman episodic games on the pc ps3 and the 360

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:54.680
And these are going to coincide with the theatrical and dvd release of the films

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.160
So i'm assuming running up through march and you know, whenever the hell the film comes out

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:05.880
And they are actually going to be prequels to the movie and the storyline. So that's kind of cool

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:12.520
and they showed off some footage of it and the first uh, the kind of level that they showed off was with night owl and

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.640
uh row shot and it was kind of um

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.600
Pretty cool like beat him up type game

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:24.700
Game, they said it's also being um crafted by the person that's uh, or I should say the team behind faith in a 45

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.560
uh, which I want to say was a

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.480
game cop

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:34.280
Game cock game that was supposed to be coming out. No, actually, I think that that didn't have a publisher yet

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.080
but uh faith in 45 looked pretty awesome, so

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.240
um

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.920
Looks good. Can't wait to see it

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.240
Uh tiger high in our chat room wanted to point out loki

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.720
Warner brothers is also releasing a series of animated digital comics of the watchman on itunes

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.880
The first chapter is free cool

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.880
So if you're into the watchman, this is a very happy period of time for you

01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:00.520
Uh, also a very happy period of time for geometry wars fans because geometry wars 2 is coming and guess what?

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:06.840
Unlike most xbox live arcade news. We usually have it's coming earlier than anticipated. That's great news

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.720
Uh, it's coming this week. July 30th is the big day for geometry wars 2 the bad news

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.640
It's not another five dollar game

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:17.880
It's a ten dollar game, but supposedly, uh, this game has a lot of new features

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.840
And you can even see from the early screenshots kind of like a four player mode in this game, which looks to be pretty awesome

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.840
um, so

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:31.720
I will definitely be checking this out and downloading it and apparently the trial version of geometry wars 2 is like the full

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.940
deadline game mode including

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:39.720
Multiplayer support but only locally but that's still pretty cool that the demo seems to be pretty generous for this game

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.680
so well, then the multiplayers are online anyways, because

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:47.320
You know with a game like this, they can't have multiplayer online because the lag is true. That's true

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.240
Uh, and bobby wants to remind you guys there is a trailer on xbox live for the new geometry wars

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.720
Yes, there is I downloaded it and checked it out. Looks looks pretty neat

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.720
Uh, I wonder if the graphics are really going to come out with that softer tone to them because it kind of looks neat

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.200
Uh, the graphics have this kind of adjusted

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.160
Uh, I don't know if it's just the early screenshots or what but I have a feeling this might be the final product this adjusted

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.560
Like soft tone to them that makes it look like an old vetrex game or something

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:13.240
It looks like they put vaseline on the camera lens

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.760
But it it sounds better than loki's describing it

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:22.040
It makes it gives a real soft look to it that gives an old 80s game flare. So it's kind of cool. I like that

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:27.560
All right, it'd be awesome to have geometry wars on vetrex like someone to do a homebrew game

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.720
You never know people are pretty crazy

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:34.520
All right, uh, this is now the part of the show where we're gonna take a quick break

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.840
Um, but not until we get to the classic game of the week because we always before the break like to talk

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:44.600
A little bit about the past and retro gaming goodness, which how appropriate following a story about geometry wars 2

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.600
Which is a little bit of a throwback to retro gaming

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:53.320
Dark soccer is going to dig through her archives and find an actual retro game that you all ought to check out and this week's title

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.720
If I'm not saying it's pretty obscure at least it was one

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.920
I had never heard of until I saw it on because I get I get to know before the rest of you

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.600
I saw it on the show roll this week

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:09.800
So i'm very curious to hear more about this game tonight in dark soccer's classic game of the week

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:17.720
The classic game of the week is a game that was on the neo geo systems, um put out by um

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.200
Sauris is the developer. Um, it's called shock troopers

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.920
Shock troopers is really freaking awesome

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:32.200
Um, basically, it's imagine how like a plane shooter game would be except you're running on the ground and that's what you've got

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.760
Um

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:41.880
You um, basically you can uh fire your guns in eight directions. You can strafe you can um

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:49.080
Uh, if you attack uh point blank, you can actually get items and bonuses and power-ups and the extra life things like that

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.040
You can you actually have a dodge button too

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:57.880
There's a team battle mode. Um, you can uh, pick different, uh soldiers in the game and everything

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.680
Um

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.680
and actually, um

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:08.680
One of the uh, the cool things about this is that um, it was actually intense. It was uh,

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:13.880
From what I understand that it was actually sort of intended on being a nod to metal slug

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.520
So that's actually pretty cool even though it, you know completely is in a different, uh

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:26.040
Direction, but you've got uh different characters too. You have jackal who has a grenade for special weapon milky who uses napalm

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.240
There's a loki in this who uses explosive shells

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:34.040
Southern cross who uses a boomerang marie b who has a rocket launcher

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:40.760
Rio has exploding arrows maru has grass gas grenades and big mama has a grenade launcher

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.600
I want to play this game as big mama. That sounds awesome

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.400
But as you go through the game, um, you can actually pick a different path the jungle mountain or valley

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.200
um, and you can switch to a different route or

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.200
Continue on the same so it's basically sort of a running gun sort of sort of game cool

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.720
The guy has a flamethrower right there looks like a kari warrior watching it. Yeah, it looks like a car

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.800
Yeah, it is a lot like a warrior a lot more souped up

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.080
Um, and there's also one called shock trooper second squad

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:11.400
Um, that's supposed to be stand alone. Um, no connection

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:17.560
Um, and uh, you can only choose the four characters, um, and it has no team mode

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:24.040
It is also a little bit more cartoony and um, the sprites have sort of a rendered feel to them

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.160
Um, because it's actually it's a lot completely too deep. The 3d graphics are pre-rendered. So

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.400
It's actually a release on playstation 2 and psp

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.440
So that's pretty cool. It was actually we got it in north america through the smk arcade

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:43.960
It was actually we got it in north america through the smk arcade classics volume one and now you can get it on the wii 2

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.520
That just came out

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.960
Really yeah smk arcade. Oh, oh the class. Oh, I thought you meant on virtual console. I'm like really I don't remember

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.880
Okay, I like the music in it too. It's very, you know, let me turn it up a little bit so people can hear

01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:04.520
It's a little hard to hear over the gunfire, but you get a sense for it

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:13.160
Cool, all right. Yeah, pretty cool. So there it is your classic game of the week shock troopers for the neo geo

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.640
Pretty awesome. I think it's just the neo geo arcade systems. Well, you know

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.440
close enough

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.840
Yeah, it never took that back. It did come out on the um, avs

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.040
I was gonna say couldn't you get just about any arcade came out on the avs?

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:31.160
Is it a hard to find one? I don't think so. Okay. I just had forgotten about it. That's all right

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.360
All right. So there you have it shock troopers your classic game of the week and we are going to take a quick break

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.880
But we will be back in just a minute with more of orange lounge radio again

Hi, this is your buddy rob roberts here recently

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.760
I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on xbox live

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:11.800
You always can't suck my fucking dick. I just got a dick in your ass. Do I have dick in your butt?

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.480
Can where's barbie? Yeah, where's barbie? Is that urkel urkel's your barbie, huh?

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.200
She in malibu or no, please stop spewing hate speech on xbox live

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.000
It doesn't make you look cool. It won't get you any friends and at the end of the day

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.060
You still have an incredibly small penis

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.860
Gaming radio so uncensored

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.600
So

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:53.400
Welcome back boys and girls to orange lounge radio. We are live here on this lovely sunday evening

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.440
july the 27th 2008

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:03.800
For more of the same great gaming news and chat and your comments at chat orange lounge radio

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:06.280
calm

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:11.560
All right, we're halfway there. We got plenty more news to cover tonight. Uh, let's get right into it

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560
Loki start us off

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.440
If you can put you on your ds for five minutes come back to the show you are

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:26.200
I'm, sorry. Am I interrupting something loki? I was just playing cord 10 ds. Anyways, um, there are rumors via linked

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.440
Or I should say a leaked

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.560
pictures of a I guess a psp case

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.360
Um saying that the psp 3000 has already been or is in works right now

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:42.680
In fact, this supposedly picture is of one of the designs that they I don't know didn't go with

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.480
and um some of the features though on this design which may you know

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.240
Reflect some of the changes that we'll see in the final psp 3000 design

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:57.100
Includes a built-in microphone and that they replaced the home button with a playstation

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.640
button much like on the um

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.080
Ps3 six axis or dualshock 3 controllers, so i'm not too surprised by that

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.080
I'm, not too surprised by that. Um

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.880
That might also explain why we don't have the microphone attachment out here yet

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.520
Because there may be a whole nother

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.840
psp coming out

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.020
And i'm sure this one will be completely unhackable

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:25.800
Oh, yeah, because sony prevented that now you they they said we're putting stuff to this right now. That's right

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:30.200
It's only taking us a few years, but we're putting stuff to it. Absolutely no more

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.520
All right. Well, what do you think?

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:37.880
I mean is it time for the psp to get a remodel or is it too soon or will it drive sales? What?

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.640
um

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.480
I don't think it's going to drive sales

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.480
I mean it might a little bit because they have a built-in microphone it may allow them to do

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.680
More things with it depending on what features they add to it

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.440
You know with a built-in microphone you can play crappy karaoke games

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.160
You can do the stupid stuff that they do with the ds where you can blow into the microphone to do things

01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.960
I don't know

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.760
Um might be kind of cool to do really crappy skype

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.120
Without using a headset with it. I guess that's true voice over ip possibly, you know

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:14.920
You could do some side talking so sony fans next time. Uh, someone tries to tell you the psp blows you can say yes it does

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.800
right

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:23.160
Or you blow on the psp you blow the psp, you can go blow the psp. Um

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:31.000
Um, hey one of the uh, interesting games that was being shown at e3 this year by sony was a little game called fat princess

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:39.640
Um, very unique standout title. That's for sure. And apparently the game is playable with 32 people online. Uh, and uh, what's

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.600
It just kind of looks interesting. It has a very unique kind of art style to it kind of looks like a cartoon thing

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.760
but apparently

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:52.140
The feminist gamers are not happy is his actual gaming blog feminist gamers.com

01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:57.100
Gamers.com is one gaming blog and shakes shakesville is another one

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:05.500
Shakespeare's sister.blogspot.com which by the way great 90s band with shakespeare's sister, uh, these uh blogs are not happy. Uh, they are voicing. Uh,

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:11.100
Great displeasure to sony, uh in shakespeare. They said quote congrats on your awesome new game sony

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:16.620
I'm positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat-hating

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.460
heteronormative assholes and then uh feminist gamer, uh,

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:27.100
Quoted quote instead of running out into the forest to find cake to fatten up the princess with why not go out and find gold

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:32.140
To stuff into a treasure chest the more gold in the chest the heavier it would be and the harder it would be to carry

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:36.940
Uh, so obviously some women groups are getting very upset now titan studios

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.640
The art director there has actually came out and commented on the whole situation

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.100
after this, uh, he actually um

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:49.660
Said does it make it better or worse that the concept artist who designed the look characters and everything is a girl?

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.540
So how about they all just shut up and get over it?

01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:58.300
Learn to be offended people. It's not you know, if people got their you know

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:03.180
Less of a stick up their ass about certain things. I think the world would be a whole lot nicer. Don't you?

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:09.340
And notice that the game is called fat princess. It's not saying like all women are fat

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:14.060
I mean if they put out a game called that I can see where people might get a little bit offended

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:17.820
But it's just a princess who happens to be fat

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:22.380
But let let us remember the mika song big girl. You are beautiful

01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:27.980
What's what's wrong with you know this this is just it's innocent

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:31.340
I think people are just getting their feathers a little too ruffled over this. You know what I mean?

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:34.860
So

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:39.660
Yeah, there you have it. I'm curious chat. Is it is it offensive or no? Let's see, uh,

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:47.260
Game guru says they complain about unrealistic looks for women with laura croft. I guess trying to say, you know, laura

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:51.900
you know, it should be called or the game should be called fat princess gets no love and

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:57.820
Because she's fat. Let's see. That's wrong. That's right. That's offensive. Uh, janaya says fat kirby

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.500
I don't see kirby's pretty fat. How how about this?

01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:05.260
How about lose any sort of social, you know?

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:08.620
The the only reason that I think that there's such a bad

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:13.280
Social stigma about this is that people do get offended about it

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.280
It's like why can't people just learn to accept themselves and to stop

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:25.200
Being so fucking offended if you don't have a problem with weight then don't worry about it

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.040
It's not your problem

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:31.040
What if they don't get offended for people? Why don't they just call the game? I like cake

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.680
perfect

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:39.760
Okay, because seriously if cake offends somebody then there's just no pleasing you right

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:44.800
I like cake. I like cake a lot. I mean seriously look at me

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.680
All right. Can we move on please?

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.760
Loki offends me

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:57.200
Well, guess what? What's that? Something that might not offend people. Although people always find a reason to get offended is um

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.000
There's gonna be more dragon force in guitar hero 3

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.120
I I the only thing that's going to be offended is my high score

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.600
With that because if the dragon force songs are as hard as the one in the game i'm going to be screwed

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:14.560
well, the songs that some of the songs included are heroes of our time and operation ground and pound and

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.360
a revolution death squad

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.000
Nice, they're going to be 500. Um

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.880
Microsoft points for those three

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.880
Sounds like a good time. Hell. Yeah

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.600
I like dragon force good stuff

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:31.200
I just wonder if they're all going to be as freaking hard because that's going to suck

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:37.760
Well one thing not coming to the playstation network anytime soon is wipeout hd

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.860
Apparently it's being held up by epilepsy tests. The game is so hardcore. It makes people have seizures

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.240
So, uh now that's offensive

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.040
yeah, apparently, um

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.960
I guess it's

01:23:52.960 --> 01:24:01.040
I guess it's according to uh computers and video games wipeouts h or wipeout hd's delay is because um

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:04.800
A little bit more technical features. It's uh extra features

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.880
and

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:11.360
Apparently it needs to be re-engineered in order to pass the epilepsy tests

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.120
Can you imagine what would happen if sony had neglected to do that like how much poop they'd be in?

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:23.120
In the general populace if they had like just forgot to make that kind of testing and all these kids everywhere

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.920
Were having seizures because of a video game. Oh my god

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.920
I guess it's a good thing. They go through all these strict tests before video games released, huh?

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.240
Yeah in a way

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.320
It's a good thing. They have all those seizure warnings on their manuals and stuff. That's true, too

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.800
Um, anyhow the dark knight have you seen the dark knight movie?

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.040
Kind of yeah kind of neat. No, I'm not going to you're not excited. I don't want to see it

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.240
Why not? It wasn't bad. It was long. I've decided. I don't want to see it

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.880
All right. Well your choice it is

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:56.480
Movies are expensive these days. It's 10 bucks to go see a movie. Uh, well, they are making a video game based on the dark

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.760
night, uh

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.920
And yeah, I know big surprise. That's not news, right?

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.920
But I guess they've kind of kept this all under wraps

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.080
It was actually gary oldman in an interview kind of uh spilled the beans that the game was coming out

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:10.880
And it caused this whole like little controversy where a video was out and then it was pulled and now it's out again

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:16.560
And all this other dumb stuff not to mention that was also leaked by ign before that. Well, I mean seriously, duh

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.720
There's going to be a dark knight game duh

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:24.000
Duh, duh, they've been making batman games ever since the old nes batman game, which was actually pretty rad

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.240
The old batman game was awesome. The old batman game was awesome batman returns less awesome

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.720
But the original batman game was pretty awesome and there's even lego batman and all this crap anyway

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.740
But um the dark knight kind of funny enough. It was not there at e3

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:43.140
Um, but it is still coming out and i'm imagining the game will be out probably around the time of the blu-ray release

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:47.700
Uh of the movie and dvd release of the movie which will be you know in time for christmas

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:53.300
I imagine uh gary oldman does is quoted in the video saying quote. It's hard to make a movie like this under the radar

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:58.340
Game i'm assuming no he meant to say the movie, you know because the movie things go out

01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:03.220
But it's just kind of ironic because you know duh the game was coming right duh duh

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:05.220
Uh

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:08.340
So there you have it uh dark knight the game coming out soon

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.020
Joy

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:15.300
Anyway, um, and by the way, I don't want to see it just because i'm sick of hearing about it

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:17.940
That's why I don't want to see it

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.220
um

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.020
What?

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.060
I was gonna say

01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.660
It doesn't make it any worse of a movie though

01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:26.420
But I understand hype hype machine sometimes kills things and will kind of like, you know

01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:29.140
If you hear all this hype this hype this hype about something you need to watch it and you go

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.500
It's good, but it's not great. And that's what a lot of people are saying about batman

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:37.140
It's good, but it's not that great of all this hype. I didn't really care about seeing the last one either

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:40.500
See, I just saw it at home as a batman fan

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:44.500
I think they're far better than the schumacher films which were terrible terrible terrible

01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:48.500
These new yeah, they don't exist in my world, but these new ones not so bad

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:52.900
In fact, really I I I thought this new one was long, but it was worth my time. It was good

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:57.860
I agree with my husband. I won't see one until I get a soul, uh, uh a two-face only movie

01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.020
I don't want to say anything as a spoiler. I already know i'm just gonna back up for that

01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:06.260
But I will say this. I already know I also paid ten dollars to see mamma mia this week now that I would see

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.660
And i'm going to see x files as soon as I get chance. I will only see mom. I'm sorry

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:12.740
I'm sorry. I heard yeah, I heard the x files movies

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:19.540
Not hot. I really don't it's fan service though. If you watch the show, you'll probably like it stay stay through the credits

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:23.140
You don't want to miss that one. My my point is that

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:28.740
My point is that I want to form my own judgment on it. So i'm gonna just see it for myself

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:33.060
Fair enough. I won't see mamma mia again though until they let the audience sing along with the movie

01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:36.900
Were they

01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:40.340
Dexter game that's coming out for iphones. Do you remember us talking about that before?

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:47.060
Um, actually, uh mark echo, um, who is a he does that clothing line and does graffiti

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:52.340
um is actually uh supposed to be working with it, I do believe and um

01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:58.420
It's uh, his development company is actually making the game and it's going to be an uh episodic content

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:03.060
And as far as I know I do believe that uh, dextre is a a show about a serial killer

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:07.700
Who is a uh splatter analysis for the miami police department?

01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:10.260
so, um

01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:11.860
He's uh

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:16.340
It's a very interesting premise and I think that the the game has a good promise

01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.620
He's a serial killer that kills serial killers because he has the urge to kill people, but he doesn't want to

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:23.300
but he doesn't want to

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:25.300
So he kills serial killers

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:29.940
That's extra special. It's on showtime, which means you know, it can be

01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.820
Which means I won't watch it

01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:37.540
Yeah, I think they've run it on cbs a couple times like during the rider strike and stuff when they needed programming

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:41.380
But you know, it sounds like an it could be an interesting game interesting

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:47.940
Keyword i'd just like to see it see what episodic content they're thinking of and the fact it's on the iphone of all things

01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:50.020
It's kind of it's interesting

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:52.980
We'll see how it turns out. I guess tap here to murder

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:56.900
Gold banjo and chat says I see that show every once in a while and I think it's awesome

01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:01.380
Well, no, I heard a lot of people like it. I just since I don't have show time. I don't really watch it

01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.540
Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to comment

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:08.580
Well last week we talked a little bit how there were rumors that grand theft auto 4 was coming out on the pc

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:15.140
Well now there's even more confirmation of this first starting off with the pc gamer magazine from malaysia. Yeah, I know that's not

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:21.700
Exactly in the us or uk or whatever, but hey, it's on the cover. So that's got to say something, right?

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:28.020
um, so they had a big little article about that and um also there was a um,

01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:34.660
Posting which is now removed on the esrb website. Apparently no one got the memo over at um,

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:40.660
Rockstar games about the fact that you can delay when your um posting gets listed on there

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:44.900
Oopsie, so it's more or less coming out. Of course

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:49.300
Rockstar games is denying that they well, they're basically telling the truth

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:53.220
We have made no announcements regarding a pc version of grand theft auto 4

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.700
But yes, that is

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.760
entirely accurate

01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.460
Um

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:06.100
So, yeah, i'm sure it will be coming to pc. It's not a surprise all the like last few have so

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:08.740
And this means hello hacking

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:13.220
That's what i'm most interested in is all the mods for it. That'll be awesome skinning

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:21.300
How many days let's make predictions how many days before grand theft auto 4 pc has a topless mod?

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:23.640
Meaning all the women walk around topless

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.380
10

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:28.420
10

01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:33.060
I I say it comes out before the game's even on shelves like it'll get pirated before the game's even out

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.220
And somebody makes the mod before the game even comes out

01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.860
There you have it

01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:44.500
All right. Well also, uh coming out and uh another port that's highly anticipated although of a completely different type

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:48.820
It's the game peggle the popcap game. That's kind of like a plinko on crack

01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:50.740
Uh, I don't know if you played this game

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:55.220
I really enjoy it on the ipod and I bet there would be a lot of ds people who like this game as well. Um

01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:01.940
Apparently though one at one time this game was denied by popcap as existing but popcap has come around and confirmed

01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:05.860
Yes, we are making a peggle ds game and it's coming out this winter

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:11.300
Um, that's really all there is to say about it right now. But uh, hey, it's it's popcap. It's peggle

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:14.740
That means you could already try it out for free probably on popcap.com

01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:18.020
I think this is one of their games you can try for free and you'll have a good idea what to expect

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:23.540
On the ds later this year and it's fun, you know for a casual game. It's a lot of fun. It's stupidly simple

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:28.020
You just fire a ball down the little you know playing field

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:32.580
It's I guess you could say the closest thing it resembles is like pinball in a way although

01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:36.980
You know pinball has ramps and you know other things that peggle doesn't have but it's it's neat

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:40.580
I enjoy peggle. It's a great ipod game. It's almost made for the ipod

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.420
So, all right

01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:45.620
This is the part of the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to participate with us

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:50.580
This is a little segment we have here on the show called the orange lounge radio mailbag every week

01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:56.340
You guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and dark sakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them

01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:00.740
Right here on air for us to respond to or make fun of depending on what kind of mood we're in

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:03.140
So let's open up ye old mailbag and dark sakura

01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.020
Take it away

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.140
Fresh email comes from azhp

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:16.180
Hey, olr crew with all the talk about f-zero gx being one of the greatest racers on last week's show

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:21.720
And eager anticipation of a wii title being announced. I figured i'd poke my head in and say that unfortunately

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:26.980
Miyamoto went on record saying he wasn't he was extremely disappointed in how sega

01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:33.300
And how sega approached f-zero gx slash ax and that if f-zero were to be made for another console

01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:35.300
It would not be in the same style as gx

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:38.820
This is probably because it was too difficult hard confusing

01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:42.740
But in my opinion, it was really one of the greatest racers for the sense of speed and chaos

01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:46.420
That came with playing the game even at the rookie difficulty levels

01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:51.780
The game was critically acclaimed as well received higher than um, eight over ten for most game reviewers

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:58.100
I um, I for one love love loved f-zero gx and i'm more than excited at the thought of another f-zero game

01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:01.380
Especially in hd, but unfortunately, it probably will never come to pass

01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:05.460
Let's hope miyamoto comes to his senses and green lights this game because honestly

01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:11.620
How could anyone not like that game aside from getting terribly motion sick on it or something keep up the great work in ps

01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:15.940
I went to disneyland for the first time in about 15 years and I now realize why you guys trip down there

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:18.820
So often it really is a place where dreams come true

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:22.900
Oh, I haven't been in like a year. So I don't have my past anymore. So

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:29.700
Um, but yeah f-zero, I mean I I think it's stupid that they won't do another one just because you know

01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:33.300
They don't think it'll work. I don't think of some stupid we feature to implement in it

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:39.060
That'll make it worthwhile at least I hope I really hope because you know, you're right. It's critically acclaimed and uh,

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:44.900
You know gamers that bought it loved it and I I just I hope they do it. I hope a miracle pulls through

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:49.940
I hope a miracle pulls through i'm not going to hold my breath, but um, it would just be great

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:53.300
Well, how about you miyamoto realize that?

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.860
Maybe they should actually give gamers what they want

01:33:56.180 --> 01:34:02.420
Wasn't there actually a dsf zero after ax gx? I still thought I thought there was I I could be wrong

01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:05.060
It might have been before but I seem to remember there was one after

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.620
well, um

01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:08.740
next email

01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:13.700
Um, hi, olr and this comes from ritual insomnia actually j rod. Sorry. Oops. Sorry

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:20.820
Um, first off I must say I'm thrilled beyond belief in your choice for putting out one podcast instead of two small ones

01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:24.260
I work 10 hour days and look forward to listening to you guys on fridays

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.660
So thank you for making the decision for one podcast so I can get you earlier and make one days easier

01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:33.620
I'm emailing because I have a hard decision to make you guys had your e3 wrap-up show, which was great

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:39.460
But failed to even mention a huge huge title gears of war 2 i'm absolutely stoked for this game

01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:44.180
And you didn't even mention a peep about the level playthrough at microsoft's keynote

01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:51.220
I actually didn't think about it. Sorry, um, this puts me in a position. I don't know whether to chainsaw your ferret or not

01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.300
Well, you can't get to the ferret so you can't

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:58.260
Um, I mean you did make up for by having a discussion about the new, uh game silent hill

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:06.020
Okay, you used game a bunch of times homecoming and declared a pyramid head day, but you dissed the good old-fashioned curb stomping sequel

01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:10.260
How are the humans supposed to win the fight against the locusts without your support

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:16.260
My uh, marcus says chainsaw dahlia. Gillespie says for me to be nice

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:21.860
I don't know what to do with you people these emails sponsored by the olive garden home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks

01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:23.860
And i'll stop ripping off my signature fools

01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:30.500
Dude, seriously, it's not like I forgot about gears of war 2. I did not forget about gears of war 2 a lot of news

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:36.260
I just didn't care. I honestly didn't fucking care. I hated gears of war 1 and gears of war 2. Guess what?

01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:39.700
I'm, not buying it and to be honest. I mean there's enough news out there

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:43.540
Do I really need to mention that they played through the level of you know gears of war 2?

01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:49.940
No, I don't need to because guess what we didn't talk about every single demo that they have there. I mean, seriously

01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:54.820
I'm loling because i'm looking at the show roll and I see what story we have coming out of the mailbag tonight

01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:58.740
That's funny. Well that that is funny and you know, we've mentioned plenty of them

01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:03.060
It is funny and you know, we've mentioned plenty about gears of war 2 prior to that show. So

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:07.140
That's what I had to say who gives a crap

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:11.620
Well, bobby bobby makes a good point though in chat. He says gears of war 2 wasn't really at e3

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:12.980
It was just at the keynote

01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:17.060
He says gears of war 2 will be playable at packs half of microsoft's booth will be gears 2

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:21.620
So even though we did have the playthrough at packs, you know, not a lot of people or I mean i'm sorry at the e3

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:27.780
Keynote we didn't have a lot of people. Um get hands-on impressions of the game and you know for for somebody like me

01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:32.420
Who's not quite as into that series? There's not a lot for me to say other than well

01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:34.580
It looks like the first one but better a little bit

01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:40.420
But I don't know I I know there were a lot of actually there were a lot of non-shooting people that were really into gears

01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:42.580
Of war 2 so who knows i'll give it a go

01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.300
I will give gears of war 2 a go, but i'm not going to buy it the day

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:50.260
It comes out like I did gears of war 1, but I will check it out through a friend or something

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:54.900
I'll make lowkey loamy his copy if he even buys it or something or I guess i'll just have to get a gamefly account

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.020
I don't know

01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:00.660
But I just realized there was a lot a lot of e3 news next week some things fell through the cracks

01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:08.580
Next email, um, good sunday evening to you. Olr. I trust that. Everyone's been having a nice week so far

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:14.500
Anyways, i'd like to say i'm kind of slow on catching up on the past couple of episodes because I can't store them onto my ipod

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:21.460
Anymore, I have a one gigabyte shuffle and I carry around wherever I go and I can usually save 50-ish megabytes for olr

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:28.340
Since the newer episodes are seven are 70 megabytes now i'm struggling to make ends meet on my ipod very nice format though

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:31.140
When I heard the news about final fantasy 13

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:37.400
Being a 360 release as well. I tried thinking of ps3 exclusives

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:44.420
While the first party fair have been from decent, um motorstorm to best games i've ever played metal gear solid 4

01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:48.260
I've yet to see many good third-party games. Hayes doesn't count

01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:54.260
Um, what i'm saying is that developers should put a little more faith into the ps3 by releasing original innovative games

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.940
Not just crappy added bonuses that were originally for dlc ports

01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:05.240
Is it something with the cell processor that turns developers off or is it the fact that more people own 360s?

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:09.620
But I first can't wait for the naruto ps3 game coming out in october though

01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:16.120
One last thing with the addition of butterfly and ww and ddrx. I think that konami has gone too far and reminiscing

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.640
um

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:24.440
I mean sure those are a couple of the best songs ddr has offered in its 10 years, but it just seems a little dated

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:31.000
Uh, the additions are like a slutty girlfriend. She may be nice and all but who hasn't done her

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:37.320
That's funny. I mean any ddr player has played butterfly at least 100 times in his or her life, right?

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.720
Why add it in a console version now?

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.040
Well, that's all I have to say

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:48.040
For the past few weeks and e3 while disappointing for some did have some very high points until next time katamari's forever

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:51.800
This message brought to you by kenya home of the never-ending american ip addresses

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.200
Well, i'm sorry to hear that the new format's not working for you, buddy

01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:01.160
Um, you know, obviously there's always gonna people love the idea and some people that don't like the idea

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:07.400
I I hope you're able to negotiate 20 more megs on your ipod to make it work. I hope one way or another so

01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.040
That's what i'll have to say the rest of it, you know

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:12.040
Good thoughts

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.560
That's it there's more okay

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.960
Um greetings everyone ron may uh here live from the laundromat show and some heart. Are you at the laundromat right now?

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:23.400
No

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.400
Yeah, well, no looking at the time

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:29.960
Before I begin there's a few things i'd like to say to dark sakura

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:34.840
Um, i've said thank you like hundreds of times, but thank you again for everything when I came out to visit

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.260
I truly loved and enjoyed everything words cannot describe how much I appreciated your hospitality

01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:44.620
When you come to nyc, I will give that back to you a thousand fold. Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you

01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:47.900
To rob. I wish we had more time to hang out not enough

01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:51.420
Thank you so much for allowing me to be part of the show two weeks ago and fyi

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:54.380
Part of my reasoning for coming back was to be on the show

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:58.620
As I said before when you come to new york city, I will give you that back

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:01.280
Give that back to you a thousand fold because you're so fabulous

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:05.340
To loki you're all right in my book too bad. We didn't get a chance to talk more and

01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:08.940
Uh and be more chill you were supposed to come join me and jamie for lunch

01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.940
Yeah, I did call you a couple times

01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:16.140
Um, I was looking forward to that, you know, but it's okay when you come out here to new york city

01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:19.180
I will show you a damn good time now on to some other things

01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:23.260
Oh, wow, this is a long email, sorry

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:24.620
um

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:30.060
I've said in the past. It would not surprise me that square enix would put final fantasy 12. He said 12

01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:37.040
I guess maybe means 13, um on xbox 360. Thank you screen x for saving my roommate 400 on a paperweight

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.040
I know the reason why they keep doing this and it's the same reason

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.940
I feel that konami will put metal gear solid 4 on the xbox 360

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:48.000
I'm not saying that because i'm a drooling fanboy, but from a financial point of view

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.600
The money that these companies are investing in the titles will not be made back on the ps3 due to the fact that it has

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.320
A lower consumer home base and then the 360 that that was the point actually I agree with

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:04.800
I'm putting these titles on another next-gen platform will allow these companies to make back more money invested in these titles

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.040
And speaking of konami people are calling for others to not support konami as a sad reality

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.440
I understand where you're coming from about this though

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:14.400
The whole lawsuit with konami versus viacom is not konami's fault

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:19.600
You have to blame ad division about this because they're the ones paying licensing fees to them for guitar hero

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:26.900
Everyone is saying that konami is too little too late, but people have forgotten that there's more to the companies besides bemani

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.360
Konami has other titles such as will castlevania contra metal gear solid to name a few

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:36.320
Also konami is focused on more drum than guitars if you look at the song list

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:38.560
um

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:42.960
I have heard people saying that the game looks like trash, but honestly, I like it. I like the gameplay screens

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:47.280
And what annoys me more is that bemani fanboys girls

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.760
Are going to foam at the mouth because of no guitar freaks drummania tracks in the game

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.680
If konami added a lot of those tracks

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.640
They would be alienating the casual gamer who has never heard of these songs and wouldn't bother to get the game

01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.720
That's my two cents on it

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.280
Any who keep up the good work and don't stop believing

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:10.320
This email is brought to you by joey pisanos on mulberry street in the heart of little italy home of the 595 lunch specials

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.160
You'll love pisanos

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:17.840
And also by anime jam sessions the newest anime cosplay podcast cheap plug. Yep

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.880
um

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.200
Yeah, uh

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.160
I I I like what black hole is saying in chat right now

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:31.040
I'm, just reading does he like the dark gray note on the black background that you can't even see because that's one of the symbols

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.840
No, I I don't agree with him that

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:37.600
If you put some bow mai tracks in there that alienate, you know

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:44.000
The people that were gonna buy it or whatever. Um, I mean look at some of the tracks that they have in guitar hero

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:51.280
That are unlockables like their bonus tracks that are non-life either independent artists or you know, um

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:53.920
at the time harmonics, um

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.600
Artists like kind of like freeze pop and stuff. I mean i'm pretty sure freeze pop isn't main, you know

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:05.440
A mainstream artist that everybody would love. I mean because some people find them annoying like me

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:06.640
um

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:14.400
And so some of the guitar hero tracks or guitar freaks tracks could easily be unlockable songs in that but no

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:17.040
That would be you know

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.480
Trying to even incorporate their old audience into it. Oh, well that

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.760
That would be awful. I mean, I would think they would want to do that because at least those people might buy your game

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:32.560
Whereas the other people may not buy your game. So at least try to get what sort of audience you have already

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:34.960
To buy that game

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:39.680
On the other topic. I agree with his reasoning for the final fantasy 13 on the xbox 360

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.640
It just makes sense that they want to get up make sure they get all the development costs back

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:46.160
By making sure they get a good share of the u.s

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.000
marketplace

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.360
Um marketplace, um, although I think there would have been a lot of people that would have jumped ship to a playstation 3

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:56.720
Just to get it for final fantasy. Um, 13 myself being one of them

01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:59.680
But I still generally agree with the ideas on why they're doing it

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:02.400
So there you have it

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.680
Any more emails tonight one one more

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:08.640
Hey, olr

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:11.600
Hi, i've been thinking about starting to play world of warcraft

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.600
But the 15 a month fee will take up most of my yearly gaming budget

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.440
I would like everyone's opinion on whether it is whether or not it is worth

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.100
The fee is guild wars or another mmorpg without a fee a viable alternative

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:29.440
I heard that there are free private servers for world of warcraft as well. Are these legitimate? No

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.200
They're not very good time. Keep on keeping on seth

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.520
um

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:39.840
I honestly world of warcraft. I got very burned on it very quickly

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:44.080
I suggest if you can find like a a trial

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.480
Try out a trial of it, you know, see how you like it

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.400
But guild wars I think will be better for your money

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:54.640
If you're wanting to play a legitimate game that has a user base already

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:59.840
Or you know go old school like a bunch of us are and play on a free, uh, ragnarok online server

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.200
I I agree though that guild wars is a viable alternative to world of warcraft. I mean, it's different

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.920
You can't you can't say they're the same game because they're not the way they you know at glance

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:12.400
They look the same and even at first kind of when you're first playing them

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.800
You're like, oh there's a lot of similarities, but kind of the way the end game works is much different

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.800
I mean guild wars is really, you know about guilds warring in the in the kind of final end stages

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:26.800
There's only 20 levels in the game after all, um kind of a little more pvp-ish

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:30.560
But I do think uh, you know warcraft is a lot of fun

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.480
Obviously i've been playing it for a long long time

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:37.280
But I mean if that's really all your gaming budget really going to warcraft in that case

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:42.160
Um, I I would agree check out a demo you can get a demo for two dollars or if you know anybody

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:47.440
Uh that is already in warcraft hell if you email me i'll get you a freaking code so you can download a 10-day demo

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:51.360
Uh any player in the game can has access to be able to do it through the warcraft website

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
And you can download the client online

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:55.200
so

01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:00.160
Very very easy to check out the game and judge for yourself because you get a pretty decent amount of time to judge the game

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.800
and you know, I I actually I sort of had the thought of uh,

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.800
Giving it one more go myself

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:11.680
I mean I got really annoyed with it and but I figured if I you know

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:15.040
And this is what I always do is that I play for a couple months and quit again

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.840
so

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.360
I guess being in school. I'm not gonna really have a whole lot of time to play but I was thinking of

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:27.280
Maybe giving it another go just it got really boring blood elves are hot. They are

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
But it got really boring

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.680
Oh, I didn't think they were around when you were playing last time. Yeah, it was. Oh, I couldn't remember

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:40.720
I couldn't remember. I had just upgraded. Oh, wow. Okay. Remember? Yeah, that's right. I remember I remember. Yeah

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:42.800
All right

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:43.920
So that's it for the email then

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.240
All right

01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:48.400
If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange launcher trader.com is the place to send those emails

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:52.800
For now loki is going to take us back to some gaming news with a very familiar topic. Yes

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:57.520
Uh, how ironic all of this, uh gears of war 2

01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.400
There's some new things been announced about it including that they're going to have some content

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:06.560
For gears of war 2 unlocked by achievements that you've earned from gears of war 1

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:13.040
And they gave a couple examples of unlockable characters based on different achievements that you had. So that's kind of neat

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:19.760
And also there's supposed to be one uber bundle coming for it kind of like the legendary edition for halo 3

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:24.560
which will be the 130 lancer bundle that will come with a

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:29.920
Lancer, um, yes a miniature replica model of a lancer. What game is this again?

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:33.200
Gears of war 2 i'm getting gears of war 2

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:38.240
It's not the same kind of lancer that you're thinking of. It's a chainsaw gun

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.440
I still want one

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.320
All right, I like everything lancer, what about the whole achievements thing

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:53.680
The whole achievements thing. Yeah. Yeah, I mentioned that. Oh, sorry. I spaced for a minute

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.200
I don't know. What do you think of it though? It's an achievement horn. I think that's kind of cool

01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:00.720
Yeah, I think it's something they should implement in other games. It will get you to buy

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:07.520
Some of their older games like gears of war especially for the achievement horror in all of this exactly you make the announcement now

01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:12.900
They just released that gears of war refresh time to buy your copy of that for like 39.99

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.800
And then you get some achievements and you unlock some new stuff. They used to do that kind of with um,

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:26.000
Burnout actually remember um burnout like uh, three and stuff like that. They used to burn out revenge actually did this

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:33.520
Um, if you had a game save for burnout 3 you got a car from burnout 3 and then also if you had a madden save

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.240
Um, you got the madden van

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.400
In burnout so interesting. I don't understand why they don't do this more often. But yeah, whatever

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.200
All right

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.080
Um

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.600
Cool, I like the idea

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:50.400
Uh, but I don't know if I would go buy a game just for more achievements

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:55.920
But one game I am definitely considering buying is mortal combat versus dc universe because I actually like mortal combat quite a bit

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:59.440
And as even though i'm not as huge into comic books as some other people

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:06.560
Um, I think the dc universe characters are pretty good and you know tons of people have joker fever right now because of you know

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:12.080
The new movie that just came out and the gazillions of dollars it's making and so on and so on lots of people

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:14.000
Uh loving the joker right now

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.720
And so it just was fitting that this week at comic con

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:22.800
It was announced that the joker has been added to the roster of characters for mortal combat versus dc universe

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:29.040
Also, though it didn't stop there jax and katana from the mortal combat side are both confirmed for the game

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:33.840
Which I think are kind of must-haves especially katana. Um, jax is a really cool character, too

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:40.560
So i'm glad they have him there. Um also from the dc comics world green lantern is also going to be in the game

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:43.920
That could be pretty cool. Maybe seals. So there you have it

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:47.120
Um, now the question is since uh villains

01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:54.800
Supposedly could have fatalities even though heroes count because the whole dc comics rules could the joker kill people in the game

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:56.320
I don't know

01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:57.760
I I don't

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:02.640
I think even if their fatalities are going to be really um kind of softened down. You're not going to see any head ripping

01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:04.720
honestly

01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:06.320
If it's the joker

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.320
You don't know what he's going to do

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:13.040
I think that if they give him fatalities they either should or shouldn't go off at random

01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:17.760
Like like if he pulled out a gun it either blow their head off or like punch him with a big fist or something

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.280
Nice idea. I like that or like say bang because this is the joker you don't know what he's going to do

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.520
He does this to freak you out

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:31.040
That's a good idea. That would that would be very joker and then you know, you could get like bang bang bang

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:36.400
You know three things in a row and right when you think oh, it's not gonna happen. Boom headshot. So

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:39.280
uh game guru, uh

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:43.920
Uh, um hypothesizes the joker will use his laughing gas in our chat room. Um

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:49.520
Zennane chat says jax was booed when he first came up at the panel. That's sad. Jax is cool

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.520
He has mental arms because they he he's got his own fatality done on him somehow

01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:57.760
Oh

01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:02.560
I would like to say that I have some interesting news. Oh, really

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.440
Yes, really and this makes me quite happy

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:12.240
Um, although i'm actually going to include something else that wasn't quite mentioned. Um, well that we don't have in show role

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:16.240
But ties into this, uh, thanks to somebody else bringing it to my attention a few days ago

01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.160
um

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:23.520
there is actually um a rumor stating, um, and this actually, uh was going on at a

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.320
san diego comic con 08, um

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:29.120
marvel studios president of production

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:35.440
Um was saying, uh, well, they were actually asked if there would be another marvel versus capcom and he said yes

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:37.440
And maybe sooner than you think

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:44.400
So, but the other thing i've been reading is that when and you know, i've covered this on the show before um,

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:51.520
Tatsunoko versus capcom which by the way, there's more stuff out more characters in it including a hurricane polymer

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:52.800
kashan

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.240
gachiman

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.600
um

01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:57.600
The robot one I can never remember the name of

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.600
um tekkeman

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:04.480
And for for anyone who's like and also batsu is in it from rival schools. Um, uh,

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.440
morrigan, um, just a bunch of you know characters

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:13.840
But going back to the the marvel, uh versus capcom tie-in is that they're actually saying that with um, the current test machines being out

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:19.200
In japan for tatsunoko versus capcom that marvel was sort of like, uh, we want to make money off of this again

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:24.640
Since you've got this brand new shiny fighting game engine. We want to use it, please

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:28.240
Except we're sort of licensed out right now, but it would still be nice

01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:30.800
Please

01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:33.600
Aj mixx wants to see some power stone characters

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:38.320
There actually from what I understand they have a uh for tatsunoko versus capcom

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.800
And actually if you give me a second i'll get the character list for you real quick

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:46.080
Um, the actual full trailer of for tatsunoko versus capcom is actually up on um youtube right now

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:50.080
You can find it easy just looking up tatsunoko versus capcom, but give me just a quick sec

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:54.640
I just think the whole thing is interesting. I I this always makes me laugh how you have, you know

01:52:54.800 --> 01:53:00.480
The street fighter and mortal combat were always kind of like these two, you know competing franchises in the fighting game world

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:04.960
And you have dc comics and and marvel or the two in the comic world

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:10.320
It's just really funny how the cards fell and you always have marvel versus capcom and now you have mortal combat versus dc

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:14.800
Finally after kind of all these years when you would think this team-up would have happened a while sooner

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:21.600
Okay, so far I don't have the the full list of everything. Um, okay here's what we have so far for the list of tatsunoko

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:28.640
Versus capcom characters. We have um, awashi no ken who is a g1 for gachaman. Um, kashan from uh,

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:35.920
The kashan anime tekaman from tekaman the space knight yataman number one from yachaman hurricane polymer

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:40.160
and uh gold light on from golden warrior gold light on and from um,

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:46.480
Capcom, there's ryu chun li batsu from rival schools alex from street fighter 3 morgan from um

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:49.440
Darkstalkers and silky from onimusha dawn of dreams

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:55.120
So it's actually on location test. Um in tokyo right now. Um,

01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:00.640
And hopefully i've been hearing that there might actually be a bit more. Um,

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:05.360
As far as an actual release date soon. In fact, i'm pulling up another

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:12.160
Uh list here that they're saying a december 2008 actual release window. So that's fairly cool

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:14.640
I hope they they add more characters, though

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:20.240
I really do but the poster though seems to be pretty finalized the one that they've got out now

01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:25.840
All right, i'm just surprised I I want speed racer as a hidden character

01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:28.880
That was a tatsunoko production thing

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:36.400
Lord katsuhito in chat says tatsunoko versus capcom could come to the u.s. It just depends on who holds what license to which tatsunoko anime

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.920
Still is going to be a pain in the ass though, you know either way

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.880
So, you know what?

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:45.040
I i'm gonna import it no matter what so

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.040
got to

01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:51.840
You love gachaman and all those other characters. I I would not that news does not surprise me one bit

01:54:51.840 --> 01:55:00.080
All right, um, well if you have been following core, which is that new downloadable magazine that they have on the playstation network

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:02.960
You'll probably have figured out that

01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:10.400
If you have purchased the I want to say the august version of core and whatever one just came out

01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:13.840
You'll actually be able to get into the

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:22.320
Resistance 2 beta this september and um, also there will be some other ways to get in besides that

01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:30.080
According to my resistance dot net but the best way to get early access involves you pre-ordering the game

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.080
And they'll make some more announcements regarding that soon

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:38.080
But if you want to get in early access, you can get in early access

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:44.240
But if you want to get in early access, you can get in early access, you can get in early access, you can get in early access

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:50.800
But if you want to you can pay $3 for core and not only do you get a demo for the new naruto game

01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:53.520
But you get into um the resistance beta

01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.800
Huh

01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:01.600
I I don't like this whole pay to get into our beta thing. That's been very popular lately, you know

01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.840
Whatever happened to the good old, uh fashions, you know

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:06.480
sign up for it

01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:09.840
You know, it doesn't go out to the public at all. It's just friends and family, even that.

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:10.760
I don't know, it's a little silly.

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:12.280
The pain for demos have been around for a long time.

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:15.760
Remember when you used to have to buy the PlayStation Magazine to get your demo disc?

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:16.880
Doesn't mean I like it.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.120
Doesn't mean I like it one bit.

01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:25.560
Do you, will you sign up for, you like Resistance, will you sign up for a core membership?

01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:30.120
No, because it's a 60-player multiplayer online, and I didn't really play much of the online multiplayer.

01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:33.680
I played mainly the single-player campaign, so I'm not interested.

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:35.600
Well, then there you go.

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.720
All right, well, I think we need to get, give out an award for stupidity.

01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:49.040
Thank God it doesn't have to do with any type of mass murder thing this week or anything like that.

01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.480
It's much easier this week.

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:55.520
It has to do with a dumb media person, and it's Jane Wells from CNBC.

01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.560
Congratulations, you're the wiener of the stupid award this week.

01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:06.880
Here's why. It's because she has gone on to the network and has basically declared that Sony is going to win the console battle.

01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:12.360
Now, I don't have a problem if people want to declare that Sony is going to win the console battle,

01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:17.840
as long as they use, you know, figures or sales or even history, for God's sake.

01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:24.240
I don't care, but here's the reason why she said that Sony is going to win the console war.

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:29.040
It's because her son said so. Her 16-year-old son said so.

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:34.840
He was an Xbox 360 fanboy, but then the E3 press conferences happened, and this happened.

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:38.040
He watched the Sony press conference, and the world as we know it changed.

01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:43.840
After hearing about Metal Gear Solid 4 as well as other PlayStation exclusives in the pipeline and the awesomeness of Blu-ray,

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:49.440
he promptly packed up his Xbox 360 and all his games and went down to GameStop to trade them in.

01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:54.040
As we left the store, I said to him, I never thought I'd see you at the PlayStation.

01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:55.840
Neither did I, he replied.

01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:02.040
Not to mention that they said that he was also ahead of all the industry trends and stuff like that,

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:07.240
that he kept on top of all the stuff going on in the industry.

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:13.840
I like how he was just finding out about Metal Gear Solid 4 weeks after it had already come out.

01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:19.840
I don't have a problem with a 16-year-old and his opinion.

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:27.840
I have a problem with his mother being in a position of mass media reporting it as fact, kind of.

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:33.840
I thought it wasn't that he thought they were going to win the war, that they already had won the console war.

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.840
I don't know. Either way, it's retarded.

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:40.840
And this shouldn't be reported on CNBC.

01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:45.840
Which is Financial Investor Network. That's the problem I have with it.

01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:51.840
And the whole thing sounds like a big old, you know, I want a PSP for Christmas thing.

01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:58.840
Well, if you listen to this show for any length of time, then you will know what segment is coming up next.

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:14.840
Music

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:23.840
I would like to say F you to whatever has caused my grandmom's current medical condition.

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:26.840
My grandmom is in the hospital right now.

01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:29.840
It's nothing, I guess, really life-threatening or anything like that.

01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:33.840
I mean, it made her really sick, but I'm really, really worried about her.

01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:41.840
And I just wish I knew what caused something like that so that maybe it could be prevented, you know, in other people.

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:46.840
And my mom's had some of the same problems, so it's quite likely that I might later on.

01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:50.840
So, you know, I guess genetics, too, have something to do with it.

01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:59.840
But I just, you know, F you to the fact that my grandmom's in the hospital, that there's something wrong that required her to be there in the first place.

01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:01.840
Well, I hope she gets better.

02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:04.840
Well, I'm sure she will. She's going in for surgery on Tuesday.

02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:06.840
And I'll tell you guys more often.

02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:08.840
Sure, that's fine.

02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:09.840
Alright, Loki.

02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:14.840
F you to people at movie theaters, especially the ultra ghetto people.

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.840
Especially the ones that are like, do you have a cell phone I can use?

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:22.840
And I'm like, no. I don't own a cell phone at all.

02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:24.840
So, get the fuck off.

02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:26.840
That's it.

02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:38.840
Speaking of genetics, I guess I'm going to also give a similar F you tonight because it looks more and more likely that I am going to have my gallbladder taken out later this year as part of the reason why I have my whole pancreas issues in the first place.

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:42.840
And although it's not a big deal, a lot of people have had it done. It's pretty common right now.

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:48.840
It just... surgery sucks. Period. So, I'm not looking forward to that.

02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:53.840
And that means that I am going to be out of Orange Lawn's radio for probably two weeks at some time in the fall.

02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:57.840
I don't know when, but that will be coming up where I'm not going to be able to do the show for a couple weeks.

02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:05.840
So, it's too early to speak to what's going to happen during that period, but it's going to happen.

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:08.840
So, wait for it.

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.840
F you to that.

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:15.840
Anyhow, let's try to get back into some happier news in the gaming news.

02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.840
DarkSakura, what you got for us? Come next.

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:20.840
Oh, just some stuff.

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.840
Cool. I like stuff.

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:29.840
Well, do you know our good friends at Overclocked?

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:40.840
Well, actually, it seems that some of the people behind Overclock remixes are actually going to be...

02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:44.840
And this is just going to give me a second, because for some reason my laptop decided to freeze.

02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:53.840
But some of the tracks are actually, from what I understand, going to be in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD remix.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.840
At least as far as I can see on here.

02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:04.840
So, I think that's pretty cool. They're going to be having some of the more famous ones on there actually work on their remixes.

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:08.840
DJ Pretzel, we've actually had a few of the stuff on here.

02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:17.840
Lion Tamer, Zircon, Shale Riley, I guess I don't see a nickname for him, but I think that's pretty cool.

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.840
They're actually turning to the fan community to contribute to the game itself.

02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:28.840
I agree, that is pretty cool. Kudos to Capcom. You're doing a lot of stuff right this year. Good for you.

02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.840
I figured it out.

02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:35.840
Well, something else that's going to be going on here pretty soon.

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:47.840
You may remember Telltale, the company that still hasn't released the Strong Bad game that was supposed to be out this month.

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.840
Well now, what if it's Nintendo holding onto it? What if it's Nintendo's fault?

02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:55.840
Oh wait, you're talking about Nintendo's never at fault. That's just lies.

02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.840
That's what I thought.

02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:06.840
But they are actually putting out a Wallace and Gromit episodic game called Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures.

02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:14.840
Players of course will be able to control both animated characters and hilarity will ensue from there.

02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:24.840
No sort of release dates were given or anything like that, but kind of imagine what a Wallace and Gromit game would be like, very similar to the animated series.

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:26.840
So, that's kind of neat.

02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:29.840
Episodic gaming is the wave of the future.

02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:32.840
Hey, over at Telltale, yeah, that's kind of where they make their bread and butter.

02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.840
But you know you're in good hands over there, so that's going to be very interesting I think.

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.840
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to go to our Skype line at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:47.840
Click on interact with us for all the details. It's OrangeLaungeRadio is our username on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:55.840
But first, one last story, and it has to do for those of you guys, you know, if you are in the OL Army on Facebook, then maybe you're a Scrabulous player.

02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:59.840
But the smack has been brought down on Scrabulous finally.

02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:06.840
Hasbro, the company behind Scrabble, they have decided to place the smack down on the Scrabulous Facebook game.

02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:15.840
Apparently a request was already put in by Hasbro some time ago to pull the game, and it was not responded to, and that was back in January.

02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:24.840
So Hasbro has filed an infringement suit on the folks that have created the Scrabulous game and is demanding that Facebook pull the application immediately.

02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:26.840
They even put out a whole little press release on it.

02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:30.840
It should be noted, one interesting part I kind of liked in the press release here is it says,

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:38.840
between the classic board game, Facebook, Pogo, the iPod, and the iPhone, our members can now play their favorite game virtually anytime, anywhere.

02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:44.840
Alluding to the fact that there is an actual Scrabble application on Facebook that people seem to not be using as much.

02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:47.840
Maybe because Scrabulous was already kind of out there at the time.

02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:54.840
So, I mean, the lawsuit kind of makes sense, I hate to say it, but if you've played Scrabulous, it's Scrabble.

02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:57.840
There's no denying that.

02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:00.840
But at the same time, it got old.

02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:02.840
Like, I know there's a lot of people that play Scrabulous on Facebook.

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:05.840
I played it like once or twice, and I'm like, okay, bored now.

02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:10.840
I mean, Scrabble's fun, I think, in person, but not quite as fun over the internet for me.

02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:12.840
That's just my opinion.

02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:15.840
Are you a Scrabulous player at Dark Sakura?

02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:17.840
Sometimes.

02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:19.840
Yeah? Alright, that's cool.

02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:21.840
I mean, it's a fun word game, but I don't know, it got old for me.

02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.840
It's always the same people I want to play to.

02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:28.840
And then, you know, when I first installed the application, I got like all these invites to play a game,

02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:32.840
and I just, you know, I can only handle like one game at a time, alright?

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:33.840
Alright.

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:38.840
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:43.840
The Skype line is now open for business.

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:45.840
Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.840
Hey, it's LordKatsuhito.

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.840
Is it now? What, you changed the name tonight?

02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:54.840
Are you referring to that in the Jedi sense?

02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:56.840
Maybe.

02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:59.840
Do not start singing the Bughram song.

02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:01.840
So, Rama, you already had an email read tonight.

02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.840
This phone call better be good. What's up?

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:06.840
I want to talk about Fat Princess.

02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:09.840
I want to discuss this game, okay?

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:10.840
Please do.

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:13.840
That alone makes me want to drop the 400 bucks for a PlayStation 3.

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:15.840
Really? Why?

02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:17.840
The game looks fun. I'm sorry.

02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:26.840
It looks fun. I've spent money on frivolous things, but that'd be the most expensive frivolous item I've ever purchased just for one silly little game.

02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:32.840
And these feminists need to sit down and shut the fuck up. I mean, really.

02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:40.840
Yeah, I think people are going a little overboard with it, but, you know, I don't know if I would buy a PS3 over this game, that's for sure.

02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:44.840
Although, then again, Geometry Wars was a big reason why I got an Xbox 360.

02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:49.840
Not the sole reason, but a big reason. I would say Xbox Live in general was.

02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:56.840
It's a good thing you said that, because I have to go get that game too, but let me say my quick point about Fat Princess and I'll be on my way.

02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:58.840
Sure, go for it.

02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:01.840
The feminists are bitching them on about Fat Princess?

02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:06.840
I mean, where were they when all these games were coming out where the hero had to go rescue their heroine?

02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:09.840
Where were they? They didn't say Jack. They said nothing.

02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:18.840
Now the game with a fat cat, now they run their mouths? Feminists, gaming feminists are a bunch of fucking hypocrites. That's it.

02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:27.840
I would like to see Link save a shapelier princess one of these times. Why not? Why not?

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.840
Just kind of throwing that idea out there.

02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:33.840
And then roll her over one of those switches in the dungeon to solve a puzzle.

02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:35.840
No, no, no. You know what, though? I would like to see more.

02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:39.840
Why not? If we're going to go for diversity in this sense, let's go for diversity all around the board.

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:45.840
But this just goes into the whole fact where we need more gay people in games, we need more people of color in games, we need, you know.

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:49.840
There's a simple solution. Everyone, get over it.

02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:51.840
Be more open-minded.

02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:59.840
I'm never going to stop playing games, but it doesn't mean I don't have my I would like to's, and I'll still play Fat Princess.

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:01.840
No.

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.840
Alright, any other thoughts, Rama?

02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:05.840
Don't stop believing.

02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:07.840
Alright, I'll hold on to that feeling, my friend.

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:13.840
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is the place to be.

02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:19.840
Let's see, comments in chat.

02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:23.840
GS68 says, we need more Filipinos in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur.

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:27.840
Frisbee said, good God, it's a freaking joke, let it be.

02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:41.840
You know, that's the whole problem is that whenever anything happens, someone's going to stomp their little foot and roll their eyes and go, I don't like it, this offends me, and then bitch.

02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:43.840
I don't like it, this offends me.

02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:51.840
Seriously though, I mean, can't people just learn to be easy going and go with the goddamn flow?

02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:59.840
I mean, and I know I'm stubborn about a lot of things, but I really, really am trying to be a lot more fluid in how I react to certain things.

02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:01.840
Fluid and flexible, that's what my boss says at work.

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:07.840
That's a good thing, you know, if people, there's going to be shit out there that you don't like.

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.840
You don't have to have a hissy.

02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:15.840
Just say, I don't like this, and then get over it.

02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:19.840
You know, freaking build a bridge and burn it or something, I don't know.

02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:26.840
Some comments in chat, SSJ100Matt says, maybe if Peach would fatten up, she wouldn't always be in other castles.

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:27.840
Why do you think she wears that dress?

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.840
Um, Shaoran, it's a slimming dress.

02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:34.840
Shaoran says, we need more short people in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur.

02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:37.840
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:39.840
Nah, it's Legend of Zaku.

02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.840
Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:45.840
Uh, nothing much, just recovering from yesterday's drinking party and all.

02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:47.840
Yesterday's what party?

02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:53.840
Nah, I just went to this party yesterday with just like, you know, masses of rock band, lots of booze.

02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:56.840
I was just about to ask, was there rock band at the party?

02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:58.840
Because you don't have a party without rock band.

02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:00.840
Alright, then it officially was a party.

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:04.840
Because I went to a party yesterday too, but they didn't have rock band.

02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:06.840
And I left after an hour and a half.

02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:10.840
But I will tell you what they had was some delicious lumpia.

02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:13.840
And that got me to stay as long as I did.

02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:15.840
Because lumpia, good stuff.

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:18.840
Anyway, sorry Zaku, I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about food.

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:21.840
What did you want to ask or tell us about tonight?

02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:25.840
Well, let me see, the whole, I'm trying to think right now.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:31.840
The fact of the matter that, you know, Street Fighter IV and, you know, the state of the arcades in this country.

02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:37.840
The fact that people are going to have to go out of their way to just import the machine.

02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:48.840
But then again, we already knew what was going to happen because Capcom doesn't see any reason, any justification to give a damn about our scene anymore.

02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:52.840
Well, we reported on an arcade game earlier tonight, the Castlevania game from Konami.

02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:54.840
And, you know, they have that Silent Hill thing too.

02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:56.840
I mean, is Konami a little more forgiven?

02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:58.840
And DDR of course, they a little more forgiven?

02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:00.840
Well, that's DDR, that's an exception.

02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:05.840
You're talking about, you know, Street Fighter was pretty much born in the arcades.

02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:15.840
And then all of a sudden, you know, especially in America, you know, American arcades pretty much gave Street Fighter the limelight it deserved.

02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:21.840
I would say true statement because Street Fighter II, I remember playing that puppy the first time in the arcades.

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:24.840
It was a big freaking deal when that came out on Super Nintendo.

02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:29.840
It was a $70 game, which, you know, 10 years ago was huge, 15 years ago even.

02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:38.840
And the fact that they turned, you know, they basically turned their backs on the whole scene instead of, you know, doing, making efforts to, like, help.

02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:46.840
Instead of, you know, instead of just beating around the budget saying, oh, too bad, because the numbers are low, we're going to keep it in Japan only.

02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:52.840
How come these arcade, here's a question, how come these arcade companies don't more often get into making their own arcades?

02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:58.840
I mean, I know Namco had a thing, but you don't see Konami or Capcom or a lot of other places with their own arcades.

02:11:58.840 --> 02:11:59.840
I wonder why not.

02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.840
Well, think about it, it's a risk.

02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:09.840
You see the current state of, you know, the current state of the economy right now and how gas is, like, ridiculously expensive.

02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:12.840
People are trying to save as much money as possible.

02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:18.840
So, the first things to go in tough times like these is entertainment.

02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:21.840
I guess I can see that.

02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:29.840
And the fact that, you know, the consoles have pretty much given, you know, given regular Americans a reason to stay at home instead of go out.

02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:34.840
Because they're out doing the graphics.

02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:36.840
I guess I can see that.

02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:38.840
Well, I don't know, what do you think the answer is?

02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.840
When do you think arcades will make a recovery, if ever?

02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:42.840
What's it going to take?

02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:48.840
It takes effort, I mean, like the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.

02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:50.840
That's a good saying.

02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.840
It takes effort on, you know, on those parts, on whoever's still releasing arcade games.

02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:58.840
Capcom, Konami, you know, the others.

02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:07.840
They really have to, like, you know, if they want to make money, they're going to have to invest warrants, you know, into many of these smaller arcades.

02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:10.840
The ones that are struggling just to get by.

02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:12.840
At least help them out a little bit.

02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:13.840
Alright.

02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:16.840
Zaku, anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?

02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:20.840
Um, let me see.

02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:31.840
Yeah, Fat Princess is probably another, you know, matter of fact, the whole, you know, the whole Final Fantasy 13, 360 thing, get over it.

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:32.840
It's done.

02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:36.840
It's multi-platform, it's like, it's not going to make a difference.

02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:38.840
Like, you were going to buy it anyways.

02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:40.840
I don't know about the listeners, but we're all over it.

02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:42.840
Here in the studio.

02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:45.840
I know, it's like old news, I'm thinking of that, I should have brought it yesterday.

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:46.840
It's alright.

02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:47.840
Sometimes you have to beat a dead horse.

02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:48.840
It's alright.

02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:49.840
Just to remind you it's dead.

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:51.840
Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go.

02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:52.840
Have a good one, buddy.

02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:53.840
Bye.

02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:54.840
Later.

02:13:54.840 --> 02:14:00.840
Oh, it's some New York, it's New York night on the Skypline.

02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:01.840
That was two New Yorkers in a row.

02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:02.840
Yep.

02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:03.840
I haven't been to New York in a while.

02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:04.840
It's been at least a year.

02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:05.840
It's time for me to go back.

02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:07.840
It's been about 12 years for me.

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:08.840
You need to go.

02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:10.840
We need to, we need to storm the big city.

02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:11.840
Be fun.

02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:12.840
Literally storm through it.

02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:15.840
As soon as $500 falls in my lap, I'm on it.

02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:18.840
We'll have to find a convention of some sort as an excuse to go out there.

02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:19.840
We'll see.

02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:20.840
Someday.

02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:25.840
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:28.840
We will get into some last minute stories here very, very soon.

02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:30.840
But first, some more calls.

02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:31.840
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:32.840
Who's this?

02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:35.840
It's GS68 and I just broke the streak of New York gamers.

02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:37.840
You're not from New York.

02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:38.840
No, what's up?

02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:43.840
Well, Zach was bringing up the arcade scene and how there are ways to improve it.

02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:53.840
One way to do that would be to lower game prices because these days, what typical gamer in the right mind would pay more than 25 or 50 cents to play an arcade game?

02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:56.840
Well, that's because those cabinets cost so dang much.

02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:01.840
But isn't it because of all the fancy TVs and fancy things they put in there that make those things be so expensive?

02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:11.840
I suppose. I mean, as much in... I hate to bring in Minnesota again, but the only cabs they have right now are those widescreen cabs.

02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:15.840
I mean, it wouldn't hurt to make a budget cab with just a regular TV, you know?

02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.840
But then everybody would know it's a budget cab and people would go, oh, this one's lame. It's not as good as the other one.

02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:26.840
You know what an awesome cab was? It was F-Zero AX. That was a brilliant cabinet. That was so fun.

02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:35.840
Yeah, but look at time crisis for the majority of like the cab... time crisis for cabinets are small cabinets and people don't have a big problem with that.

02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:53.840
Yeah. I don't know. Is it just because maybe, you know, why would I play 50 cents to play it on the little HD cab when I could, you know, just spend the 60 bucks and get the game at home and play it as much as I want on my high def 50 inch Uber TV of doom?

02:15:53.840 --> 02:16:03.840
And then, what else? I mean, arcade games used to be bigger and more adept than console games like in the 70s and 80s.

02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:13.840
Nowadays, it's the other way around. I mean, could you imagine playing on an arcade system for like five hours at a time or something like that?

02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:21.840
You know, they need an arcade game that like punches people in the face. A really unique experience that you can't get anywhere else. That would be something.

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.840
Or, finally, a cabinet that actually goes upside down. That'd be fun.

02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:37.840
Well, some good arcadets going to the arcade is in itself a unique experience. I mean, at home you'd have to bring friends over to have a huge ass party.

02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:46.840
And then there's online, but there's something about meeting your opponents in person that online doesn't have.

02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:52.840
Hmm. I suppose. Alright. Uh, GS68, any other thoughts before we let you go?

02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:53.840
Um, no.

02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:57.840
Alright. Have a good one, buddy, and good luck. I hope the arcades do come full circle someday.

02:16:57.840 --> 02:16:58.840
Alright. Thank you.

02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:05.840
Buh-bye. Because I miss arcades too, you know. 877-GameOLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We'll do one more call tonight.

02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:07.840
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:09.840
Hi, this is Akdeft.

02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:11.840
Hey, Akdeft. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:22.840
Oh, I have, uh, news here about, uh, a guy who marathoned, like, 26 hours and a half, uh, playing the drums on rock band.

02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:28.840
He played rock band drums for 26 hours and- 26 and a half hours? Did his arm fall off?

02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:31.840
Um, fortunately, not.

02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:33.840
Wow, is he playing on hard mode?

02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:40.840
He was playing on expert. Uh, he's actually a freak from the score hero forums. He's a staff member there.

02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:45.840
Uh. What did- what was the point? Was it charity or what?

02:17:45.840 --> 02:18:00.840
Just have fun, basically. He- he did, uh, something for charity, though. Uh, it wasn't that, um, how do you say it? Big? Because they- he only got to, like, $200.

02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:15.840
Well, still, charity's charity. That's still pretty cool, though. Um, and speaking of charity and these marathon things, man, they're happening- thanks to sites like Justin.tv and Ustream and all these other sites, man, it seems like there's a gaming charity event happening every weekend somewhere.

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:28.840
In fact, I actually visited a website, and I'm sorry, I don't remember the URL, but I'm sure someone in chat will jump in there with it. There's actually a website out there somewhere, like, it's like gamemarathons.com or something, that show you, hey, these are all the marathons going on this weekend if you want to go watch people play some games.

02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:56.840
Kind of interesting. I think it's more fun to play games, but then at the same time, I've always thought we here at OLR should do one of those for fun one time. Like, I think a fun game tournament that we- or not game tournament, game marathon we should do, is that- and I think this was kind of an idea we talked about kind of a little bit in circle on the show, is go to Jamie's, and in her big game archive, we'll pick games, and every hour, the listeners can vote on which game we have to play next, but they're, like, obscure shit. Like, no Mario, no Zelda.

02:18:56.840 --> 02:18:58.840
What the hell do you think I have in the vault?

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:04.840
Exactly, we're going to play obscure fucking shit from the vault, is what we would play all marathon long. Do you think people would be into that?

02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:06.840
Yeah, that would be cool.

02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:10.840
I don't know what charity we could raise money for, but we'll figure something out.

02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:13.840
I still want to do the idea I've been talking to you.

02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:27.840
Yes, that too. But I think maybe a marathon might be a good way to kind of kick that off. We'll have to think about it. Maybe for- if we weren't going to PAX, I would say Labor Day weekend, maybe Thanksgiving weekend or something, I don't know. Just throwing ideas out there. Some three day weekend, we'll have to see.

02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:56.840
Basically, the point of my call, it's because many of the comments on the Kotaku article and many forums, even on the channel he has, were basically, oh, he plays drag band, oh cool, sarcastic, and even making commentaries like, oh, he doesn't play real drums, or, oh man, he only plays drag band, he doesn't play in a real band.

02:19:56.840 --> 02:20:12.840
And it makes me kind of pissed because even though it's not the real thing, it takes practice to do that, and even for 26 hours to endure playing Expert, all the songs, even the download continent, so it's like-

02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:31.840
I have a piece of advice for those people making comments on Kotaku and whatever website ran stories on this and whatever. My advice to those people, take a good fucking look in the mirror. You're posting comments on an internet website dedicated to video games slamming on someone's rock band skills.

02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:45.840
No one put a gun to your head and told you to click the little comment button and write something making fun of someone playing rock band. If you think you're any better than the guy playing rock band, guess what? You're worse. The end.

02:20:45.840 --> 02:21:01.840
Indeed, I agree with that. There is no counter argument to that. You are worse than the guy playing rock band, which, you know what, if it makes him happy, I think he, play it for 48 hours next time. I support it.

02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:15.840
He did say that he might try on December to do that again with all the download continent that is going to be released until then. So that would be cool.

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:31.840
Alright, act deft. Thank you so much for the call and party on with rock band. Take a good one. Have a good one, buddy. Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line because it's time for us to get some last minute stories. Dark Soccer by chance?

02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:46.840
I have one quick one because some folks were telling me about this in chat and I do remember reading about it, but did you hear the rumors? And apparently there's even video now. Apparently, you know how Darth Vader was supposed to be exclusive to PlayStation 3 Soul Calibur? Apparently not.

02:21:46.840 --> 02:22:01.840
Apparently, he's actually showing up in videos now for the 360 version and vice versa. So, because you know people are breaking street on that and everything. So, kind of not a big surprise honestly, but it looks like Vader will be playable after all in 360 and vice versa for Yoda and the PS3.

02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:11.840
Now you might have to pay for download content, but it's available. It's available. Loki, anything for you?

02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:25.840
I don't think I have really much of anything. There was a trailer released for Need for Speed Underground. It kind of looks like a movie trailer for The Fast and the Furious. Or not Underground, Undercover, my mistake. So, that's kind of interesting.

02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:31.840
Porn star Tara Patrick has been hired on as a special producer for Saints Row 2.

02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:33.840
Talk about stunt casting.

02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:42.840
Really, I just think they want some of the big tits on their cover. I support that fully. Let's see here.

02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:46.840
Don't care.

02:22:46.840 --> 02:23:01.840
Facebreaker is getting a demo on July 31st and what's kind of cool about it is it will have the character creator with it and you can actually share those characters that you create online and they will also be imported into the full game when you purchase that in September. So, that's kind of neat.

02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:11.840
Let's see. Yeah, I think that's about it.

02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:21.840
Amazeatsuma in chat has a good point. Says, Sky paid for download content. It's Namco so it will be paid to unlock content. It's old caliber. You're probably right.

02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:33.840
BlackWolf says, I don't want to pay $70 to get Vader. I'll just pay $60. Okay, thanks. Well, I'll pay $60 and then maybe the $10 and I'll actually have a lot of people to play online with.

02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:36.840
Just messing.

02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:49.840
Alright, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap it up because we are getting out of here for the evening because live, for those of you folks listening live tonight, we're doing a Justin TV unboxing special tonight so that should be fun.

02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:59.840
But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thought in studio. I will start tonight. And my final thought is I want a snack. I want snacky foods.

02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:09.840
Yogurt. I want frozen yogurt. That would be really good. Oh my God, Rob. That's not really good. That's my final thought too. I want frozen yogurt. Let's go get some. We can't. They all close at nine.

02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:19.840
Well, screw that. Let's go to the grocery store. I do need to go to the grocery store though. Loki, your final thought? I don't know. I don't have anything.

02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:30.840
Alright. Wow. OLR PSP is still being worked on. I just have a lot of small things I haven't finished. But it is, I've been working on it quite heavily so soon.

02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:43.840
Alright. Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and downloading our podcast. We really appreciate it. Again, all we ask if you enjoy the show, you hear. If you like what you're hearing, we are an independent podcast.

02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:57.840
We do not have thousands of marketing dollars. In fact, we have zero dollars to work with. We don't have a big magazine backing us or a big gaming website or anything. We really struggle to connect with viewers like you.

02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:08.840
So please tell two people you know about the show and slowly through word of mouth, Orange Lawns Radio will spread like a bad STD. But a lot nicer to have.

02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:15.840
So anyway, thank you guys so much for listening to us. We'll see you next week with more of what you've come to love here on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:27.840
And again, if you are listening on the podcast, you want to leave some comments, you can always send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com or leave us a voicemail which we still need to catch up on or post on our website at the forums at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:46.840
Until then, this is Rob, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we are Orange Lawns Radio. See you next week.

02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:06.840
See you next week.
