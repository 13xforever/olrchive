14000	16000	Tonight, July 13th, 2008
16000	19000	A major lawsuit happens in the music game world
19000	22000	Mega Man 9 is set to go multi-platform
22000	25000	And we take calls on your predictions for this year's E3
25000	28000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	34000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
34000	36000	And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	39000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games
39000	42000	Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
42000	44000	My name is Rob Roberts and join me as always
44000	47000	Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
47000	48000	Yo
48000	49000	How you doing, Jamie?
49000	50000	Warm
50000	53000	Warm, yeah, it's not quite as horrid, the temperature this week
53000	56000	But we still are combating some issues here in California
56000	59000	Not just the heat, but the smoke was terrible
59000	62000	Like Wednesday or Thursday, oh my gosh
62000	64000	I am making use of Consumer Reports
64000	67000	It was like a volcano erupted, how's that?
67000	69000	To look for air conditioners
69000	70000	Oh, hooray
70000	73000	Another idea I have is an evaporative air cooler
73000	77000	Nice, now we have a little ghetto set up today that's working fairly decent
77000	78000	Because I'm a genius
78000	80000	But thank god it's not 103 like last week
80000	84000	I think this week it's 93, so hot, but not scorching hot
84000	88000	Also hot every week, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
88000	90000	Yes, I am, I run very hot
90000	91000	How are you doing?
91000	93000	It looks like you shaved your head almost completely
93000	94000	Yes, because I was hot
94000	97000	And because I didn't want to comb my hair anymore
97000	101000	It gets to the point where it's like, okay, I can't do anything with this
101000	105000	So I'm gonna have to shave it off
105000	108000	Alright, we're about to get into how is your gaming week
108000	111000	But first, just a quick little note about tonight's show
111000	114000	There's no Justin TV tonight because our video camera's out
114000	117000	So we do not have Justin TV feed tonight
117000	120000	Sorry guys, but at least it's a radio show, not a video show
120000	124000	And the other thing is that there's only going to be a part A this week
124000	127000	There's not going to be a part A and part B
127000	131000	That's partially due to the heat, also partially due to the fact that E3
131000	133000	The madness for E3 starts tomorrow
133000	136000	So it kind of defeats the purpose of uploading a show mid-week
136000	137000	Because everything will be outdated
137000	140000	We're going to try and have something up on the feed mid-week
140000	142000	It just depends if we can all get together at once
142000	144000	We'll see, so more to come on that
144000	147000	But for now, we're only going to have one big show for you guys here
147000	149000	But all the segments you know and love
149000	151000	Classic gaming of the week, mailbag, all that good stuff
151000	152000	And your calls
152000	156000	And chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com
156000	159000	And tonight, they're talking about fire
159000	161000	Act Def says the show is on fire
161000	163000	Frisbee says my hair is on fire
163000	165000	There you have it, everybody's on fire
165000	168000	You're all flaming tonight in chat at Orange Lounge Radio
168000	170000	I think I've made a decision
170000	171000	What's that?
171000	172000	What might best suit our needs
172000	173000	The cooler?
173000	174000	A swamp cooler
174000	175000	Excellent, yeah, actually my work
175000	177000	And it's cheaper than a portable air conditioning unit
177000	178000	Alright
178000	180000	Be more cost effective
180000	182000	This is economics on Orange Lounge Radio
182000	185000	Save money, use less energy
185000	187000	Alright, let's talk about all the money you blew games on this week
187000	188000	And how was your gaming week?
188000	190000	I played DDR
190000	191000	Really?
191000	195000	I played the supernova machine at the movie theater
195000	196000	And I wanted to die
196000	197000	I was wearing my sandals
197000	199000	So first of all I didn't have the right shoes
199000	201000	And then I tried to do shit that was way too hard
201000	204000	But at least you got up there and played
204000	206000	Yeah, sorta
206000	209000	I know if I play I am way, way out of practice
209000	211000	So that's my issue
211000	214000	Although I want to try a supernova 2 machine someday
214000	218000	I dusted off my Super Nintendo cartridge
218000	221000	Of something that I will be speaking of later in the show
221000	223000	Awesome
223000	226000	How about now, you are an iPhone user
226000	229000	Yes, I did download some iPhone games
229000	233000	You got the new 2.0 firmware for your existing iPhone, right?
233000	234000	Yes, I did
234000	235000	Okay, gotcha
235000	238000	And let me give the name of the game real quick
238000	241000	I haven't played a whole lot of it
241000	246000	But it's a free game for everyone who has an iPhone or an iPod touch
246000	248000	And it's called Aurora Faint
248000	253000	It basically plays like Bejeweled
253000	255000	But you have a leveling system in it
255000	256000	So it's pretty cool
256000	258000	Like Puzzle Quest-ish, kinda?
258000	260000	Mmm, yeah
260000	262000	I also downloaded the Stalker program
262000	264000	What, pray tell, is the Stalker program?
264000	266000	Whirl
266000	267000	How does that work?
267000	268000	It's like, for everyone who's got it
268000	271000	It keeps track of like restaurants and places you like to go
271000	273000	So that you know where your friends like to hang out
273000	274000	That is kinda scary
274000	275000	What a world we're living in
275000	280000	What do you think, though, about this whole, you know, application thing on the new iPhone?
280000	283000	You know, the fact that people can create their own games and applications and all this stuff
283000	285000	God damn time
285000	289000	You think it's kinda what's gonna put the iPhone really out there, but make it kinda the must-have thing?
289000	290000	Sorta
290000	291000	There's still a lot of people
291000	292000	It was already the must-have thing
292000	295000	There's still a lot of people that are very anti-iPhone
295000	296000	Well, sucks to be them
296000	298000	I think we have one sitting here in the studio
298000	300000	Sucks to be them, more for me
300000	305000	I'm anti-Apple, but that, you know, does fall under the same umbrella
305000	310000	Do you think, though, do you think another company will try to, you know, cause I notice like, what is that other phone?
310000	313000	The Instinct is supposed to work a lot like the iPhone
313000	315000	I can tell you now the LG one is shit
315000	321000	I look at that and I go, it's not gonna really be able to penetrate the marketplace the way that Apple has, I don't think
321000	322000	That's just my personal thought
322000	325000	What's gonna help Apple is marketing to other providers
325000	327000	I'll tell you what else is cool
327000	329000	I was hearing a little bit about it on Bobby's show
329000	332000	I don't know much about this, but apparently there's some type of program you can get
332000	337000	Some app you can get that you can listen to internet radio through that Edge network
337000	340000	So you can listen to All Games Radio or our show anywhere you go
340000	344000	People have it hooked up so that if you have one of those systems where you can play your iPod through the car
344000	347000	You could listen to All Games Radio, like it's a car
347000	351000	I almost downloaded it, but I have to move off my photos before I put more apps on there
351000	356000	The stuff that I downloaded so far, let me grab my phone and take a look real quick
356000	358000	Blah
358000	361000	Live radio, she's literally opening up the phone
361000	369000	I downloaded AIM, Aurora, Thaint, Twitterrific, Whirl, and Epocrates prescription
369000	373000	Because Epocrates is actually kind of a cool little program
373000	378000	That if you have, say that you find an unidentified pill and you want to know what it is
378000	382000	Then you can enter in the pill's description including serial numbers that are on the pill
382000	383000	Wow
383000	386000	And it'll look it up and show you a picture of it so you can compare it
386000	389000	And you know, if I take this, will I hallucinate?
389000	394000	Bobby spoke up in chat, he says it's called Tuner, is the name of the program you're going to want to check out
394000	396000	I think I'll download it right now
396000	398000	Awesome, it might have a cost, I'm not sure
398000	401000	Let's see, comments from chat
401000	405000	Robert M, my iTunes is showing the applications menu in place of games
405000	407000	I have the iPod fifth generation video though
407000	412000	Same thing happened to me, I have Pagle and some of the other games they've released for iPod
412000	415000	And they now are applications that run on your iPod
415000	418000	And sadly they don't have a lot of them, but that's what happened to the old games
418000	423000	I hope they do put out some other useful things for those of us that haven't gotten on board the iPhone thing yet
423000	428000	I think I will at some point, I'm just waiting for the craziness around the iPhone to die down
428000	432000	Gerardo speaks up though and says I don't see anything innovative in my phone and then hides
432000	436000	Okay, I checked out Tuner and Tuner is $5
436000	439000	$4.99 to be specific
439000	441000	Whatever, it's $5
441000	446000	So I'm gonna get it after I have money
446000	449000	I downloaded a bunch of free shit though and it was really cool
449000	451000	Now I can look up drugs at work
451000	453000	And AIM, I can use AIM at work
453000	455000	Free is awesome
455000	456000	Hells yeah
456000	458000	Unless it's yours
458000	460000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
460000	462000	It was full of hamburger
462000	464000	Oh, because I'm eating a hamburger, that's why
464000	465000	Of course
465000	468000	That is not just a hamburger, that is a bacon and cheese I see in there
468000	469000	Double bacon cheeseburger
469000	471000	Oh my god, an artery killer right there
471000	476000	Well it's because, I don't know, fast food hamburgers are pretty tiny
476000	479000	So if you get a hamburger it's like a cracker
479000	480000	Gotcha
480000	483000	So this is two crackers and, I don't know, bacon
483000	487000	By the way Jamie, Bobby is recommending Tap Tap Revenge and says it's free
487000	491000	I saw it and I looked at it but I don't think I would play it that much
491000	493000	Free Jamie, free
493000	495000	Well if it's free then you gotta play it
495000	498000	Like Yaris, you gotta try Yaris at least once
498000	503000	I also though I'm trying to be conservative for space because I really do like to take a lot of useless pictures with my phone
503000	505000	That she does, I can attest to that
505000	508000	We'll go out to Indian Food and she takes pictures of the food
508000	509000	And my beer
509000	510000	She takes pictures of his eating, her beer
510000	511000	Anyway, sorry, Loki, your gaming week
511000	512000	That's right
512000	515000	Grand Theft Auto IV, that was pretty much it
515000	518000	I've been busy and we'll get into that
518000	520000	We'll get into that in a little while
520000	522000	But Grand Theft Auto is still fun, still a lot of people playing it
522000	525000	It's still fun, well I haven't, we've just been playing the work games
525000	529000	You know, so we do our four player deathmatch because the fifth machine is still broken
529000	531000	What makes the replayability of that game so awesome?
531000	536000	Just, well like the new thing that we're doing now is we've changed the settings a little bit
536000	541000	So that the only blip that shows up on the radar is whoever is in first
541000	543000	And everyone else is invisible
543000	548000	So you're running around and whoever is in the lead, you can find them but the other players you can't find
548000	553000	So the person in the lead doesn't see like people like bearing down on them in cars and stuff like that
553000	559000	So it makes it really intense actually because everyone is kind of going after the leader at the same time
559000	560000	Nice
560000	565000	Comments from Chatroom, we have NameAndLights says I'm using Tuner on iTouch
565000	569000	So that's that iPod that's not quite, it's the iPhone without the phone
569000	572000	The iTouch which also got the upgrade to use all the apps
572000	573000	That's pretty cool
573000	575000	Let's see, other comments from Chat
575000	580000	Shaoran said there used to be a double bacon with a really long name that a friend of mine called a Satanburger
580000	582000	I don't know
582000	584000	We're turning into Orange Launch Foodio
584000	586000	Alright, so Grand Theft Auto 4 was Loki's game of the week
586000	587000	Yeah, pretty much
587000	589000	We'll get to the rest of it in a little bit
589000	594000	Myself, I also have not been playing a lot of new stuff, kind of the same old stuff, you know, Raiding and WoW
594000	598000	Guitar Hero 2, I went back and played Guitar Hero 2 this week in Guitar Hero 3
598000	600000	And I think I talked about this a couple of weeks ago
600000	605000	I'm finally learning with my fingers how to hit those notes without necessarily strumming
605000	608000	Like the difference between the notes that you don't have to strum if you get the note before it
608000	612000	I can't remember what exactly they call that, I'm sure somebody in chat will correct me, but the whole
612000	613000	Hammer ons
613000	615000	Is that a hammer ons? Yeah, I'm finally learning how to do that
615000	616000	I don't know that either
616000	618000	Hell, I'm still playing three keys, okay?
618000	620000	Well, I was able to go back to Guitar Hero 2 and 3
620000	623000	I actually beat the Living Color song in Guitar Hero 3
623000	626000	I five started my first cult of personality
626000	629000	I five started my first time on hard, not expert, I'm not quite there yet
629000	631000	But for me, that was a freaking accomplishment
631000	633000	I was so excited because that song was not easy
633000	639000	I was excited when I beat that freaking Slipknot song
639000	641000	That has the impossible introduction, that was tough
641000	643000	You have to learn hammer ons to get past that
643000	646000	I was going to say, I also, this week, it's not gaming related
646000	650000	But I kept, just even watching the trailers for it
650000	652000	And then after watching the movie, I think it would make an awesome game
652000	653000	Wanted
653000	657000	Just because, I mean, you know the whole curving bullets thing in there
657000	660000	The way they kind of like swing their gun out or whatever
660000	663000	You could totally do that with a Wii remote or something
663000	667000	I don't understand why anyone hasn't come up with this idea
667000	669000	To make this movie into a game
669000	671000	Because it would be pretty awesome
671000	673000	But The Matrix was supposed to be an awesome game too
673000	674000	Listen, okay
674000	676000	After watching this movie, you're just like
676000	678000	Why the fuck did this guy not direct The Matrix?
678000	680000	Because, I swear to God, if he directed the sequels
680000	682000	We wouldn't have an issue
682000	684000	There would be like 50 sequels to this damn movie
684000	686000	Because it's seriously so much better
686000	688000	It's the Russian guy who did Nightwatch and Daywatch
688000	692000	I know, I used to hold The Matrix pretty high up there for action
692000	695000	It's borderline, I mean, Keanu Reeves kind of brings it down there
695000	698000	But action-wise it was pretty kick-ass
698000	701000	But, oh my God, Wanted is so much better
701000	704000	Sub-Z in chat says, curved bullet is so unrealistic
704000	706000	But that's the point, right?
706000	707000	It's the point
707000	710000	You don't go in there expecting a realistic espionage film
710000	712000	Exactly, I mean, there's a guy that freakin'
712000	715000	Basically these assassins or whatever
715000	718000	Have the ability to control adrenaline really well
718000	721000	To the point where they can do superhuman things
721000	723000	That's the whole premise of this
723000	725000	It's a superhero film
725000	728000	Sort of, it's not really that superhuman
728000	731000	But Matrix stuff, where they can slow down time
731000	734000	Their perspective of it, super strength and stuff like that
734000	736000	Here's my other quick questions about Wanted
736000	738000	And then we'll go back to games from movies
738000	740000	Are there tits in the movie?
740000	741000	No
741000	742000	No tits?
742000	743000	No tits
743000	744000	Any drug usage?
744000	746000	There's lots of blood, lots of killing
746000	748000	So it's just fine, because I'm looking for the trifecta of sex, drugs, and violence
748000	750000	There's no tits, so you don't have sex
750000	752000	There's no drugs, it sounds like?
752000	754000	There's a good twist in the plot, a good twist
754000	755000	That you don't see coming
755000	756000	It's a twist
756000	757000	What a twist
757000	759000	You can have Nookie without boobs, Rob
759000	761000	Well, I guess that's true
761000	763000	But, you know, still
763000	765000	Do you watch that episode of Buffy?
765000	768000	Look, I'm surprised Angelina Jolie is in a movie and not showing her tits
768000	769000	That's all
769000	771000	Well, you see her entire backside
771000	774000	Okay, so there's a little sex, a little sex
774000	775000	Sexual
775000	776000	Anyway
776000	778000	We have T and A minus T
778000	779000	Just A
779000	780000	Alright
780000	783000	And yeah, it's supposed to be unrealistic, but it's not
783000	785000	It's basically, it's kind of like The Matrix
785000	787000	Where it's sort of grounded in
787000	790000	Okay, I want to say it's really grounded in the real world
790000	793000	But it takes place in a world that could sort of be realistic
793000	795000	And then there's people doing unrealistic things in it
795000	799000	It's sort of like that, but it's not like as ridiculous and ridiculous as
799000	802000	But, I mean, a lot of video games are ridiculous
802000	803000	Like that, right?
803000	805000	You know, they take place in sometimes the real world
805000	807000	Or a world like this one
807000	809000	It's not like you go into it and go
809000	812000	Man, this is completely retarded, like the transporter or something like that
812000	814000	This is, you know
814000	817000	I don't know, it's just really cool stuff
817000	818000	That's all I got to say
818000	819000	Awesome
819000	821000	Definitely go see it, it's awesome
821000	822000	I'd totally watch it again
822000	824000	Back to video games, I want to talk about a new game I played this week
824000	826000	I went out and bought Civilization Revolution
826000	828000	I talked about the demo a few weeks ago on the show
828000	830000	And I was pretty crazy about the demo
830000	832000	I went about the full game, I'm not disappointed
832000	836000	As a Civilization fan on the PC, I am not disappointed
836000	841000	It's not as in-depth as the version on the PC
841000	843000	It's very much simplified
843000	845000	But I think it works great for a console
845000	847000	I mean, I ran through a full game
847000	849000	Granted on the easiest difficulty
849000	852000	Because I'm still trying to get my feet wet with how to play the game again
852000	855000	But it only took me between an hour and an hour and a half
855000	859000	To get a total domination victory over my opponents in the game
859000	862000	The only kind of little bitch I have in the game that I think would get to me
862000	864000	If I was coming from the PC to the console
864000	866000	And I think you've probably heard this a lot of other places and it's true
866000	868000	You don't get to customize your game a lot
868000	871000	Like in Civ 4, you can customize the world you're playing on
871000	874000	And when you start and how the world looks and the size
874000	876000	You can customize all that stuff in advance
876000	879000	In Civ Revolution, you already kind of start with one city built
879000	881000	And that's it, you don't get to customize a whole lot of that
881000	885000	So I'm hoping though maybe with some download stuff later on
885000	889000	2K and Firaxis can remedy that
889000	892000	But it's a minor bitch in the scope of things
892000	895000	Because I think the game is still pretty cool
895000	898000	I'm a little surprised it's not on the arcade
898000	900000	There's not a lot that they're doing in this game
900000	902000	That requires, I would think, the usage of a DVD
902000	906000	I would think it's a game they could have put out on the arcade for a lot cheaper
906000	909000	So I think the price is probably one of the only sticking points
909000	911000	Because $60 is quite a bit
911000	914000	But it is a hell of a game with replayability value
914000	916000	And it's something you can play multiplayer
916000	918000	Although I personally have not done that myself yet
918000	920000	I get on and play multiplayer
920000	922000	I think it's one of those games where it's never quite the same game twice
922000	924000	And there's many different ways to accomplish the goal
924000	926000	Many different civilizations you can play
926000	929000	I do recommend it, especially if you're a fan of it on the PC
929000	931000	And you want to kind of check it out
931000	933000	But just know you're not getting a port of Civ 4
933000	936000	You're getting a whole new Civ-like game
936000	939000	That's dumbed down slightly for consoles
939000	941000	But sometimes dumbed down can be a good thing
941000	943000	Yeah, Prowler says in chat there, Simplified can be a good thing
943000	946000	And Rama says in chat, Rob is a Civ fanboy, of course he's gonna love it
946000	948000	Well, yeah
948000	950000	I don't know if I'd say I love it
950000	952000	Like I love the original Civilization
952000	954000	I love Civ 4
954000	956000	But I like it a lot
956000	958000	So far
958000	960000	So we'll see about that
960000	962000	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight
962000	964000	Again, just to kind of put it out there
964000	966000	We are only doing a part A tonight
966000	968000	And that has to do with the whole E3
968000	970000	And things being outdated
970000	972000	However, I have some good news
972000	975000	Now we're not bitter at all about not being able to go to E3
975000	977000	I mean, no one invited us to the cool kids party
977000	979000	We're not bitter at all about not being able to go
979000	981000	Oh, it's great
981000	983000	My work got an invite, but they didn't go
983000	985000	It's like, oh, we don't want to take it
985000	988000	I haven't been interested in going since they changed it
988000	991000	Although I hear there's no lines in any of that stuff anymore
991000	993000	I would just want to go to hang out with the cool kids
993000	995000	But apparently we are not part of that clique
995000	997000	But the hell with them
997000	998000	The hell with them
998000	1000000	We are starting E3 right now
1000000	1002000	We're starting E3 right now
1002000	1006000	E3 begins right now on this very radio show that you are listening to
1006000	1008000	With our very own
1008000	1010000	OLR E3 press conference
1010000	1012000	And you're all invited
1012000	1023000	Alright, and we have our own E3 surprises in store for you tonight
1023000	1026000	So the official OLR E3 press conference
1026000	1028000	Blah, blah, blah
1028000	1031000	We've had wonderful support from all of our listeners
1031000	1033000	Over the past six years of our existence
1033000	1035000	Blah, blah, blah
1035000	1037000	Our show is still making no money at all
1037000	1039000	But it's sure fun to listen to and do
1039000	1040000	Blah, blah, blah
1040000	1042000	Okay, let's get to the good stuff
1042000	1045000	We have three announcements tonight that will change our show a little bit
1045000	1046000	For the future
1046000	1049000	Now one of these you have probably heard about a little bit
1049000	1052000	But we're just kind of confirming it on our own program tonight
1052000	1055000	And that is that we are going to PAX
1055000	1056000	Penny Arcade Expos
1056000	1058000	If E3 won't have us
1058000	1059000	Then F you
1059000	1061000	We're going to go to Penny Arcade Expo
1061000	1064000	I think that's funny because isn't that also Latin for peace?
1064000	1065000	I'm not sure
1065000	1067000	I didn't do research before tonight's press conference
1067000	1069000	But we'll say yes for now
1069000	1070000	But here's the thing
1070000	1071000	It gets better
1071000	1073000	Now sadly Loki is not going to PAX because of the wife
1073000	1075000	But you know things happen
1075000	1078000	But myself and Dark Sakura are going to PAX
1078000	1079000	But it gets better
1079000	1080000	Not only are we going to PAX
1080000	1083000	We are going to be on the floor
1083000	1086000	Actually broadcasting live radio
1086000	1089000	It's a partnership thing that we're doing with All Games Radio
1089000	1091000	They're actually going to be set up there
1091000	1093000	Out there on the floor with like bean bags around
1093000	1095000	It's something called the Sumo Lounge
1095000	1097000	I myself have not been to PAX
1097000	1098000	I don't know what this is
1098000	1101000	But it's going to be near the tabletop gaming and the press room area
1101000	1103000	They're going to have the Sumo Lounge with bean bags
1103000	1106000	And we're actually going to be broadcasting from the show
1106000	1108000	Friday, Saturday, Sunday
1108000	1111000	That's 3 hours on Friday starting at 4 Pacific
1111000	1113000	3 hours on Saturday starting at 4 Pacific
1113000	1117000	And 2 hours on Sunday starting at 4 Pacific as well
1117000	1120000	The whole thing is going to be moderated by Bobby Blackwolf
1120000	1122000	Our buddy that precedes us here on Orange Lounge Radio
1122000	1123000	We will be a part of that
1123000	1125000	We'll be kind of on and off of there
1125000	1128000	We might do our own podcast from the site to supplement it
1128000	1130000	But we'll be live as a part of this on All Games Radio
1130000	1131000	It's not just us
1131000	1136000	DMN, your old pal from our network as well as Understation Live
1136000	1137000	He's going to be there
1137000	1138000	Bobby's there
1138000	1139000	Super happy fun time show
1139000	1140000	Dead Pixel Live
1140000	1141000	Electric Sisterhood
1141000	1142000	Game Addict Hotline
1142000	1143000	Shatterbox
1143000	1144000	Evil Avatar
1144000	1146000	All there, all represented at Penny Arcade Expo
1146000	1149000	It is the freaking Voltron of independent podcasting
1149000	1150000	Live
1150000	1153000	August 29th, 30th, and 31st in Seattle
1153000	1156000	And if you can't be there in person you can still listen to the madness on
1156000	1158000	AllGames.com
1158000	1160000	It's going to be awesome
1160000	1163000	Bobby would like to clarify it is not in the exhibit hall
1163000	1165000	But it's still within the convention center
1165000	1166000	So there it is
1166000	1170000	And the OLR PAX broadcast will also be podcasted
1170000	1174000	Bobby will let you know when our segment is
1174000	1175000	That we're going to be on it
1175000	1177000	And it's apparently going to be its own special podcast
1177000	1180000	So stay tuned to AllGames.com for more information on that
1180000	1183000	Second announcement
1183000	1185000	You asked for it, you got it
1185000	1187000	We're going to do it
1187000	1190000	I know that part B has been very delayed lately
1190000	1193000	Throughout the week in getting pushed to the podcast feed
1193000	1194000	So we're going to try something new
1194000	1196000	Don't say that OLR doesn't listen to the listeners
1196000	1198000	Starting with next week's show
1198000	1201000	Part A and B will be released as one giant show
1201000	1205000	Parts A and B combined into one giant show
1205000	1208000	And we will have something that kind of even runs in between the shows
1208000	1210000	When you're listening to them on the podcast
1210000	1212000	It will not be the show itself
1212000	1214000	But probably promos for other shows
1214000	1218000	And other fun things that we want to try doing with the podcast
1218000	1221000	Some of these joke ads and things that we were talking about
1221000	1223000	We're going to kind of start to get our feet wet with that
1223000	1226000	So starting next week parts A and B combined in one part
1226000	1230000	So you no longer have to wait until like Friday or Saturday to hear the whole thing
1230000	1233000	You will get to download it Monday at the latest
1233000	1235000	Which will be pretty awesome
1235000	1236000	Alright
1236000	1238000	And the third announcement
1238000	1240000	And my favorite
1240000	1242000	Is really awesome
1242000	1244000	Loki why don't you tell the listeners a little more about this
1244000	1246000	What you've been working on for the past few weeks
1246000	1250000	Yes and unfortunately I wish I could say that I was done but I'm not
1250000	1254000	That's okay because at E3 you sometimes tease things that aren't coming out until Christmas
1254000	1255000	And this should be out a lot sooner than this
1255000	1257000	It's not going to be until Christmas
1257000	1258000	I definitely hope that
1258000	1260000	I worked my ass off for the last
1260000	1262000	Probably about a month on this
1262000	1267000	Anyways yes you finally are going to get an update to OLRPSP.com
1267000	1269000	Finally
1269000	1271000	But there's some good stuff coming with that
1271000	1274000	The big part of it is actually going to be
1274000	1277000	The brand new OLRPSP all games radio streamer
1277000	1279000	Which is going to be
1279000	1282000	Kind of like the radio players that you see on the PSP
1282000	1285000	But definitely a lot cooler than all those
1285000	1287000	In fact
1287000	1289000	Hopefully that will be released soon
1289000	1292000	With that will be the OLRPSP flash chat
1292000	1296000	I tried my hardest to get IRC chat but
1296000	1298000	It just wasn't happening
1298000	1301000	And let me reiterate because I saw the draft of what this looks like
1301000	1304000	And you're going to be posting screenshots to Orange Lawns Radio a little later on right
1304000	1307000	This is actually the way it looks in your PSP
1307000	1311000	It is not something you don't even have to go to OLRPSP.com in your browser
1311000	1313000	It looks like an application loaded in there
1313000	1316000	Like the other radio station listeners
1316000	1320000	When you click it, it takes you to a live radio feed
1320000	1322000	That is broadcasting all games radio
1322000	1324000	This is the part that Bobby didn't even know about
1324000	1328000	It even is taking that little box with the times of the upcoming shows from the website
1328000	1330000	And showing that as part of the player
1330000	1331000	It is awesome
1331000	1334000	And then other things are going to be included with that
1334000	1336000	There's also going to be
1336000	1339000	All the RSS feeds are going to be in there as well
1339000	1341000	You'll be able to listen to podcasts
1341000	1344000	From all the different shows and stuff
1344000	1346000	You'll be able to select through that stuff
1346000	1349000	Details on all the other shows on all games
1349000	1355000	There's a lot of small things I'm working on right now unfortunately
1355000	1359000	IRC chat on the PSP
1359000	1363000	I even tried buying the PSP IRC script
1363000	1365000	And the guy is a douchebag and won't fucking sell it
1365000	1367000	Even for a lot of money
1367000	1369000	I don't think you're supposed to say douchebag in an E3
1369000	1371000	That's alright
1371000	1373000	Breaking new ground here ya douchebags
1373000	1375000	Anyways
1375000	1377000	And then I'm going to have some more download stuff as well
1377000	1379000	I wanted to work on a theme and stuff
1379000	1381000	But it's just
1381000	1383000	Seriously I've been in my computer room forever
1383000	1385000	I will post some screenshots though into chat
1385000	1388000	So you can see a few screenshots I've taken
1388000	1391000	But it's still a work in progress
1391000	1394000	And I'm hopefully going to have it done very soon
1394000	1396000	Alright
1396000	1398000	Prowler in chat room says
1398000	1400000	This is already better than last year's Microsoft press conference
1400000	1401000	Well thank you
1401000	1402000	We try
1402000	1404000	So any estimated time on when this is going to be out
1404000	1406000	Like before the end of the month? August-ish?
1406000	1408000	I'm hoping before the end of next week
1408000	1410000	But we'll see
1410000	1414000	Oh and you've even posted a link of what one of the screenshots looks like to chat
1414000	1416000	That's going to be awesome
1416000	1418000	Oh there's two coming
1418000	1420000	So our live listeners get to see it
1420000	1422000	For those of you listening on the taped podcast
1422000	1424000	You can look at those on our forums quite soon
1424000	1426000	Those will be up very soon on our forums
1426000	1428000	OrangeLawnTrader.com click on forums
1428000	1430000	Alright
1430000	1432000	That does it again to reiterate our three points
1432000	1434000	Of this year's E3 press conference
1434000	1436000	E3 won't have us so the hell with them
1436000	1438000	We're going to PAX and it's going to be even better
1438000	1440000	Part A and B will be combined starting next week
1440000	1442000	With the podcast and the OLR PSP.com
1442000	1444000	OLR PSP.com
1444000	1446000	New website and radio tuner application
1446000	1448000	That takes you direct to AllGames.com
1448000	1450000	Radio feed coming soon
1450000	1452000	Yeah because
1452000	1454000	The PSP sucks
1454000	1456000	And it doesn't, you know, unfortunately
1456000	1458000	It takes a fucking long time to
1458000	1460000	Put pages on there because
1460000	1462000	You make it in a program for the PC
1462000	1464000	You view it on your PC and it looks nice
1464000	1466000	And you take it to your PSP and it looks like shit
1466000	1468000	So it's a long
1468000	1470000	Process
1470000	1472000	Well anyhow we are going to
1472000	1474000	Shift gears and get into our regular
1474000	1476000	Show tonight as if a press conference
1476000	1478000	Wasn't enough we have a whole regular show
1478000	1480000	To get to and that is tonight's gaming news
1480000	1482000	And Loki once again starting us off with tonight's gaming news
1482000	1484000	Alright
1484000	1486000	Well this is not
1486000	1488000	A big surprise but Konami has
1488000	1490000	Lodged a patent suit against Harmonix
1490000	1492000	And MTV over Rockband
1492000	1494000	And
1494000	1496000	I mean, I don't know
1496000	1498000	There's definitely I guess some merit to it
1498000	1500000	Seeing as it looks very
1500000	1502000	Similar to
1502000	1504000	Guitar Freaks Drum Mania, the whole setup
1504000	1506000	I'm just surprised it took them this long
1506000	1508000	But I mean
1508000	1510000	You know
1510000	1512000	Maybe they're not licensing the technology
1512000	1514000	Like Guitar Hero is
1514000	1516000	So
1516000	1518000	If that's the case you know I do think Konami
1518000	1520000	Is owed some money although it is kind of cheap to do
1520000	1522000	That and then release their game
1522000	1524000	Which their game looks like a cheap knock off
1524000	1526000	Of Rockband I don't know it's just
1526000	1528000	I wish they had done this
1528000	1530000	A lot sooner like put out their game
1530000	1532000	Instead of just bitching
1532000	1534000	About the other games coming out
1534000	1536000	Katamari's Forever in chat says confusing lawsuit is confusing
1536000	1538000	It is kind of in depth
1538000	1540000	What is it that Konami is specifically
1540000	1542000	Taking issue the way I understood it
1542000	1544000	It has to do with the controller
1544000	1546000	It's not necessarily so much the game itself
1546000	1548000	But it seems to be the fact that it's a guitar controller
1548000	1550000	Very similar to what Guitar Freaks was
1550000	1552000	When it was out here in the US
1552000	1554000	In very small arcade test markets
1554000	1556000	A long time ago
1556000	1558000	That's their point of contention
1558000	1560000	Yeah and they do have the patents in place for it
1560000	1562000	I mean I'm sure they do because it's been out for
1562000	1564000	You know years now
1564000	1566000	So
1566000	1568000	Yeah I mean they're in the right there
1568000	1570000	To defend their patent
1570000	1572000	When Rockband first came out
1572000	1574000	I guess now that they figure there's money
1574000	1576000	Involved in it and they can make a lot of money off of it
1576000	1578000	Then yeah that's
1578000	1580000	They should do it but at the same time
1580000	1582000	I kind of wish that they were just leading
1582000	1584000	You know the music gaming industry
1584000	1586000	Instead of just trying to follow and just
1586000	1588000	Make money off of lawsuits
1588000	1590000	Because now their new game
1590000	1592000	Which to be honest I don't really care too much about
1592000	1594000	And it looks kind of cheap
1594000	1596000	So
1596000	1598000	I don't know
1598000	1600000	Personally I think it kind of stinks
1600000	1602000	Because you know obviously I enjoy Rockband
1602000	1604000	But it's kind of one of those things in the back of my mind
1604000	1606000	I kind of always wondered
1606000	1608000	You know if Konami sued those folks that did
1608000	1610000	In the groove I'm kind of surprised
1610000	1612000	They never tried to go after Rockband
1612000	1614000	And then especially after hearing that
1614000	1616000	Activision's already been paying them under the table
1616000	1618000	For quite some time
1618000	1620000	For the whole Guitar Hero thing
1620000	1622000	Red Octane and Konami have had a long relationship
1622000	1624000	And then I kind of thought well maybe part of the reason
1624000	1626000	This took so long to happen is because
1626000	1628000	Konami have had somewhat of a long relationship too
1628000	1630000	With the whole karaoke revolution thing
1630000	1632000	But you know the whole timing of this lawsuit is
1632000	1634000	Awfully odd
1634000	1636000	With their games coming out this year and everything
1636000	1638000	And I think it kind of stinks but at the same time
1638000	1640000	I don't know there might be some merit to it
1640000	1642000	I just hope it doesn't stop Rockband
1642000	1644000	You know and also I think
1644000	1646000	You know well with that hole in the groove thing come on
1646000	1648000	It really was a freaking copy
1648000	1650000	Of DDR I mean in the groove was
1650000	1652000	Freaking DDR with minds and like a couple
1652000	1654000	Innovative things you know
1654000	1656000	We talked about it way past the history of our show
1656000	1658000	About the whole in the groove thing
1658000	1660000	I mean we all saw that coming a mile away
1660000	1662000	By the way we called it too
1662000	1664000	We said Konami's going to sue these folks
1664000	1666000	When they try to invade the home market
1666000	1668000	And sure enough when that in the groove game
1668000	1670000	Came out for PS2 that's when Konami
1670000	1672000	Sicked the Bulldogs on them
1672000	1674000	But it does make this whole thing interesting that Rockband's
1674000	1676000	Been out for like a year, year and a half
1676000	1678000	I mean does it, well not quite a year and a half
1678000	1680000	But about a year I mean does it take that long for a lawsuit
1680000	1682000	To get rolling? No it's just they want to
1682000	1684000	See how successful it is now that it's
1684000	1686000	You know finally come around and
1686000	1688000	They're going to be putting out their sequel and stuff
1688000	1690000	They want a piece of the money
1690000	1692000	Interesting
1692000	1694000	DarkSocker do you have any thoughts on this?
1694000	1696000	Because I know you twitted some stuff
1696000	1698000	Earlier in the week I'm curious kind of where your thought is
1698000	1700000	At this point in time with the whole suit
1700000	1702000	I think that it's petty
1702000	1704000	And ridiculous they
1704000	1706000	Had their chance when
1706000	1708000	And you know it was funny remember talking to
1708000	1710000	Jason Anis all those years ago about
1710000	1712000	Trying to bring the money
1712000	1714000	Into the US and
1714000	1716000	Working on getting Guitar Freaks and everything
1716000	1718000	They had their chance
1718000	1720000	And they had their advocate then
1720000	1722000	Did they hop on it? No
1722000	1724000	So someone came along and did it better
1726000	1728000	And you know what I think you're speaking
1728000	1730000	A lot of the same things that the music game
1730000	1732000	Community is saying is that there's this
1732000	1734000	Round of disappointment in Konami
1734000	1736000	Because you know
1736000	1738000	They had all these, this Beatmania
1738000	1740000	Series in Japan was awesome
1740000	1742000	The 2DX series awesome
1742000	1744000	Guitar Freaks, Drummania, people loved it
1744000	1746000	People were importing that stuff and everybody
1746000	1748000	Was asking why aren't you bringing it out here?
1748000	1750000	And it took one of their own
1750000	1752000	People on the USA side
1752000	1754000	Jason to twist the
1754000	1756000	Fucking arm of the Japanese
1756000	1758000	Side and we barely got DDR
1758000	1760000	And you barely got DDR and then
1760000	1762000	DDR was a huge success and
1762000	1764000	Remember how shitty that first mix
1764000	1766000	Of DDR was
1766000	1768000	Everyone was happy
1768000	1770000	And then it would just cause a landslide to DDR after that
1770000	1772000	Look how successful it's been
1772000	1774000	And then Beatmania 2DX the problem was
1774000	1776000	They didn't learn from their mistakes
1776000	1778000	They released a kind of a shoddy 2DX mix
1778000	1780000	I mean they took some risks with it
1780000	1782000	Which were kind of cool at the whole 5 key thing
1782000	1784000	But it just wasn't enough
1784000	1786000	They didn't take enough risks with licensing
1786000	1788000	That's where Guitar Hero and Rock Band
1788000	1790000	Whooped them is that they knew what the American
1790000	1792000	Audience wanted and they went for it
1792000	1794000	And I'm sorry if this offends you
1794000	1796000	Anime folks and J-Pop loving folks
1796000	1798000	That like the Bamani songs
1798000	1800000	That are in the 2DX but all of those
1800000	1802000	Songs would never have worked here
1802000	1804000	And that's kind of proven
1804000	1806000	By the 2DX release over here
1806000	1808000	It needed more
1808000	1810000	And that crappy cover of Toxic and
1810000	1812000	One Moby song that wasn't enough
1812000	1814000	It needed like half and half at least
1814000	1816000	It needed more songs that could have reached out to the American audience
1816000	1818000	But anyhow
1818000	1820000	So but my question is
1820000	1822000	Despite the
1822000	1824000	The kind of resentment we almost feel towards
1824000	1826000	Konami for not taking the freaking risk sooner
1826000	1828000	And now looking almost like a copycat
1828000	1830000	With this whole Rock Revolution thing
1830000	1832000	Does it make it right though?
1832000	1834000	Does it make it still that their lawsuit doesn't have any ground
1834000	1836000	To stand on because as disappointed as I am at
1836000	1838000	Konami I still go but
1838000	1840000	They have a point
1840000	1842000	I don't know I mean any thoughts
1842000	1844000	On that I mean do you think you still think
1844000	1846000	It's kind of like petty or
1846000	1848000	I mean I don't know
1848000	1850000	It's still petty
1850000	1852000	The format I think is so different
1854000	1856000	And so much
1856000	1858000	The other thing it has to be
1858000	1860000	Is whether or not they actually did in effect
1860000	1862000	Go and re-engineer
1862000	1864000	You know
1864000	1866000	What Konami had done
1866000	1868000	How long was the trademark out
1868000	1870000	For their controllers
1870000	1872000	And plus I think Red Octane knew what they were doing
1872000	1874000	When they originally put out Guitar Hero
1874000	1876000	They knew what they were doing
1876000	1878000	And that's why there's those under the table payments
1878000	1880000	That's what we're calling it but you know what I mean
1880000	1882000	To um Konami
1882000	1884000	But Harmonic should have known
1884000	1886000	What they were getting into as well
1886000	1888000	And I love Harmonic
1888000	1890000	So Harmonic makes some great games
1890000	1892000	That's what kind of makes this disappointing
1892000	1894000	But they kind of should have known that this might happen
1894000	1896000	It's just kind of disappointing
1896000	1898000	I don't know
1898000	1900000	Going off some comments from chat
1900000	1902000	Because I'm sure there's a lot of folks in chat
1902000	1904000	Gerardimo says 2DX was based on the assumption
1904000	1906000	That only DDR players had heard of would be playing this
1906000	1908000	That's why just about all the songs on it are in DDR
1908000	1910000	Kind of
1910000	1912000	But they really pushed Beatmania at E3
1912000	1914000	Like it was their big title but then the title itself
1914000	1916000	By the time it comes out
1916000	1918000	I mean god remember that G4 clip
1918000	1920000	Where they were calling it a Guitar Hero knockoff
1920000	1922000	And all the beat uh
1922000	1924000	Bamani fanboys were getting angry
1924000	1926000	Remember that
1926000	1928000	And then some talk as well in chat about the whole MTV Drumscape thing
1928000	1930000	Shouldn't MTV already have some type of patents on drums
1930000	1932000	Because of Drumscape
1932000	1934000	Well even if they have patents on drums they may not have patents on guitar
1934000	1936000	And I think that's Konami's issue
1936000	1938000	I don't think Konami was doing anything about the drums
1938000	1940000	I don't know
1940000	1942000	Technically Konami could be sued by the creators of uh
1942000	1944000	Several of the MIDI guitars too
1944000	1946000	Or Gibson
1946000	1948000	Well yeah but
1948000	1950000	Well Konami's guitars when they first came out
1950000	1952000	They didn't really resemble any type of real
1952000	1954000	You know form of guitar
1954000	1956000	It was fairly
1956000	1958000	I'd say an innocent design
1958000	1960000	If you know what I mean
1960000	1962000	But um
1962000	1964000	Obviously the MIDI guitars
1964000	1966000	Especially ones that have worked on Switch like that
1966000	1968000	Have existed for you know
1968000	1970000	Since the 80's at least
1970000	1972000	Um Game Guru in chat says
1972000	1974000	If Immersion could win against Sony
1974000	1976000	Konami can win against EA
1976000	1978000	And I think that's what it's gonna be settled out of court
1978000	1980000	One way or another I think
1980000	1982000	I think that's what's gonna happen
1982000	1984000	Hopefully it doesn't prevent Rock Band 2 or delay it any further
1984000	1986000	I don't think it will
1986000	1988000	Yeah I don't think it will either I think it'll settle out of court
1988000	1990000	I think uh they're gonna have to make those payments
1990000	1992000	But the problem is Konami
1992000	1994000	Their game that they're bringing out this winter
1994000	1996000	Is gonna have to really kick ass
1996000	1998000	And from or they're gonna have that
1998000	2000000	They're gonna look like jerks
2000000	2002000	I'm honestly I don't see
2002000	2004000	How they're gonna innovate on this at all
2004000	2006000	The bar is very low right now
2006000	2008000	Yeah I mean
2008000	2010000	Just looking at their drum set that they have set up
2010000	2012000	It looks stupid
2012000	2014000	It really does look stupid compared to some of this other stuff that's come out
2014000	2016000	For me it's all about the song list
2016000	2018000	I'd be very and you know well
2018000	2020000	You know atmosphere and all that is nice too
2020000	2022000	So I would hope the game is good looking
2022000	2024000	But uh song list is very very important
2024000	2026000	Uh Rama says what you all forget
2026000	2028000	Is that Rock Revolution focuses more on drums
2028000	2030000	Not guitar
2030000	2032000	Well that's nice that it focuses on drums
2032000	2034000	But I still think it should focus on everything
2034000	2036000	Since you know that's what
2036000	2038000	Rock Band is doing
2038000	2040000	Including keyboard
2040000	2042000	It focuses on everything Rock Band they have you know
2042000	2044000	Solid you know vocals
2044000	2046000	They have solid guitars and drums
2046000	2048000	It's not just one or the other
2048000	2050000	Alright well um
2050000	2052000	More to come on this as the weeks go by
2052000	2054000	I'm sure we'll hear about the settlement very soon
2054000	2056000	Or at least some type of further comment from
2056000	2058000	Harmonics and Viacom
2058000	2060000	And all those people outside of uh
2060000	2062000	This is stupid
2062000	2064000	Anyhow speaking of Konami and their music games
2064000	2066000	DDR is still trekking along
2066000	2068000	And Dance Dance Revolution X
2068000	2070000	Is the new game that is coming out on the Playstation
2070000	2072000	2 or later this year
2072000	2074000	And you know there's more DDR games coming out for the home consoles
2074000	2076000	But what might have surprised some people
2076000	2078000	This is also going to be an arcade port
2078000	2080000	Dance Dance Revolution X will be coming
2080000	2082000	To the arcades and
2082000	2084000	It is a whole new cabinet
2084000	2086000	It looks like it's actually something on a widescreen monitor
2086000	2088000	Um there's some pictures that have been posted
2088000	2090000	Over at uh bombanistyle.com
2090000	2092000	Which I believe came from that
2092000	2094000	ZenSI Vanisher site
2094000	2096000	Of an actual new cabinet and what it looks like
2096000	2098000	Some of the names have been changed like
2098000	2100000	Beginner mode is starter mode, advanced mode, course mode
2100000	2102000	There's now shock arrows
2102000	2104000	In the game which is basically mines
2104000	2106000	Although I seem to recall DDR
2106000	2108000	Has had poison arrows before
2108000	2110000	It was in one of the Ultramix games, go back and look
2110000	2112000	Um there's also going to be the
2112000	2114000	Link feature, USB
2114000	2116000	Cards will now handle edit data
2116000	2118000	So yeah
2118000	2120000	Edit data is coming back to the DDR series
2120000	2122000	Thanks to a USB memory cord
2122000	2124000	And apparently good edit data
2124000	2126000	Is going to go worldwide on eAmusement
2126000	2128000	That's pretty cool
2128000	2130000	The most commonly played stuff will be back in the game
2130000	2132000	Older songs possibly making a comeback
2132000	2134000	60 plus new songs
2134000	2136000	Including licenses and new originals
2136000	2138000	And uh developers
2138000	2140000	Say that they are committed to putting
2140000	2142000	1.5 times the amount of new content
2142000	2144000	Content in future mixes
2144000	2146000	And another thing I believe I was hearing about this
2146000	2148000	Betzen is now not involved in this
2148000	2150000	They were doing the cabinets for Supernova
2150000	2152000	Apparently they are not involved in this any longer
2152000	2154000	That could be part of the reason
2154000	2156000	I'm not sure though about all the changes
2156000	2158000	More information to come when these machines
2158000	2160000	Start being spotted out there in the wild
2160000	2162000	But uh Konami is still trying to do stuff
2162000	2164000	With their DDR series
2164000	2166000	Definitely and somewhat
2166000	2168000	You know at least
2168000	2170000	At least one of those tracks
2170000	2172000	Is probably going to be pretty good
2172000	2174000	And now there's folks saying that the poison arrows
2174000	2176000	Thing is taken from in the group
2176000	2178000	But correct me if I'm wrong
2178000	2180000	In one of the early early DDR games
2180000	2182000	Like second mix or some crap
2182000	2184000	Wasn't there like a mode where there were arrows
2184000	2186000	That you weren't supposed to step on
2186000	2188000	I thought in one of the early earlier DDR mixes
2188000	2190000	There was something like that
2190000	2192000	I don't know
2192000	2194000	I think maybe like challenge mode or something like that
2194000	2196000	Well there was also the one where you weren't supposed to step on
2196000	2198000	Any arrows that weren't currently up on the screen
2198000	2200000	But oh well
2200000	2202000	I don't think it's anything that surprising
2202000	2204000	Honestly and anyway
2204000	2206000	I didn't really call to mind things that much
2206000	2208000	Innovation in the first place
2208000	2210000	You know sure it was something new
2210000	2212000	But it didn't exactly reinvent the game
2212000	2214000	So I don't think it's that big a deal
2214000	2216000	And he's kind of putting it in this new game
2216000	2218000	I kind of think they're a little dumb anyway
2218000	2220000	I hope they don't overuse them
2220000	2222000	But we'll see
2222000	2224000	So coming to arcade soon
2224000	2226000	Well something
2226000	2228000	That makes me happy in particular
2228000	2230000	And this makes me uber happy
2230000	2232000	Is that
2232000	2234000	There is going to be
2234000	2236000	Another Sega Aegis PS2
2236000	2238000	Release
2238000	2240000	That is the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection
2240000	2242000	Which was
2242000	2244000	I do think
2244000	2246000	Fantasy Zone 2 DX
2246000	2248000	Before
2248000	2250000	But hey it's more Fantasy Zone
2250000	2252000	And I hope it's actually done up like the
2252000	2254000	The Sega Aegis
2254000	2256000	One that I already have on PS2
2256000	2258000	That was part of the Sega Aegis
2258000	2260000	2500 set
2260000	2262000	Which was named that because it was
2262000	2264000	2500 yen
2264000	2266000	But this is supposed to be
2266000	2268000	From what this says on here
2268000	2270000	Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2
2270000	2272000	Fantasy Zone Gear, Super Fantasy Zone
2272000	2274000	Oppa Oppa Galactic Protector
2274000	2276000	Fantasy Zone 2 Remake
2276000	2278000	And the Sega Aegis 2500 Volume 3
2278000	2280000	Fantasy Zone version
2282000	2284000	Sounds like a lot of Fantasy Zone
2284000	2286000	Get ready! Sounds like Do You Want
2286000	2288000	Because I think I actually have most of these
2288000	2290000	I wonder if Oppa Oppa was
2290000	2292000	Fantasy Zone 3 The Maze
2292000	2294000	Especially if there's some updated graphics
2294000	2296000	And sound and all that's usually a good thing
2296000	2298000	I want an Oppa Oppa
2298000	2300000	A little plushy or something?
2300000	2302000	I know, I do want one
2302000	2304000	Well who knows, maybe they'll be showing this
2304000	2306000	Maybe I should cosplay the Oppa Oppa one year
2306000	2308000	Maybe they'll show this to Tokyo Game Show or something
2308000	2310000	A little more in it, we'll see
2310000	2312000	I told you this story, Rob, but one time I was trying to look for the Oppa Oppa music
2312000	2314000	I ended up downloading a
2314000	2316000	Happy song in Greek
2316000	2318000	It's called Oppa Oppa
2318000	2320000	Because that means like, yay
2320000	2322000	Interesting
2322000	2324000	I'm sure it was a better song than Caramel Dancin
2324000	2326000	I'm sure that's for sure
2326000	2328000	Fantasy Zone is still a ways out
2328000	2330000	But we have some stuff coming out
2330000	2332000	A lot sooner than that, right Loki?
2332000	2334000	Yes, this week there's some
2334000	2336000	Pretty interesting stuff coming out actually
2336000	2338000	Especially if you like football
2338000	2342000	There's NCAA Football 09
2342000	2344000	And that's coming out on
2344000	2346000	PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3
2346000	2348000	Xbox 360, Wii, and the PSP
2348000	2354000	And also there is a game based off the
2354000	2356000	Looks like crap movie
2356000	2358000	But Space Chimps
2358000	2360000	That will be out on PC, PlayStation 2
2360000	2362000	The Wii
2362000	2364000	And I believe the
2364000	2366000	360 and DS
2366000	2368000	Also
2368000	2370000	Hunting Unlimited, 2009
2370000	2372000	Coming to the PC
2372000	2374000	That looks like shit as well
2374000	2376000	Code Lyoko, Quest for Infinity
2376000	2378000	On PSP
2378000	2380000	Nancy Drew, The Clue Bender
2380000	2382000	Society on the DS
2382000	2384000	For those who may have Rock Band
2384000	2386000	On PlayStation 2 or Wii
2386000	2388000	You'll get your Rock Band Track Pack
2388000	2390000	Volume 1 this week
2390000	2392000	Which has 30 songs you can play
2392000	2394000	And that's
2394000	2396000	Let's see here
2396000	2398000	And
2398000	2400000	I think that's about it
2400000	2402000	Trying to keep it I guess a little bit light
2402000	2404000	Next week though, or the week after
2404000	2406000	Next is actually going to be pretty nice with Final Fantasy 4
2406000	2408000	I would imagine
2408000	2410000	There's going to be some surprises
2410000	2412000	With the whole E3 thing
2412000	2414000	At least as far as downloadable stuff goes
2414000	2416000	Oh yeah, most definitely
2416000	2418000	In fact I was just pulling up some last minute
2418000	2420000	Story things and I've already seen
2420000	2422000	Two more speculated Xbox Live arcade games
2422000	2424000	That are going to be in there
2424000	2426000	If all the ruined ones come out
2426000	2428000	There will be like four different games coming out next week
2428000	2430000	We'll see what happens
2430000	2432000	Hey traveling over to Japan, it's a little bit of a light week
2432000	2434000	For you guys over there too
2434000	2436000	Probably for the same reasons as light over here
2436000	2438000	Dark Messiah Might and Magic Elements
2438000	2440000	July 17th coming from Ubisoft
2440000	2442000	Coming out on other systems
2442000	2444000	Such as the Playstation 3, Metal Gear Online
2444000	2446000	Makes its way so
2446000	2448000	That could also be a reason why it's a slow week otherwise
2448000	2450000	Because that's definitely an anticipated title
2450000	2452000	That is coming out for only 20 bucks
2452000	2454000	So check that out on the Playstation 3
2454000	2456000	Also coming out on the Playstation 3
2456000	2458000	Tears to Tiara
2458000	2460000	Kaka no Daichi
2460000	2462000	That is a game coming from Aqua Plus
2462000	2464000	And it not only comes out in Japan
2464000	2466000	But all Asia regions on the Playstation 3
2466000	2468000	Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii
2468000	2470000	Boom Blocks gets its Japanese release this week
2470000	2472000	That's a game I have
2472000	2474000	That I still need to play
2474000	2476000	I bought it and I haven't even played it yet
2476000	2478000	Because I got a big discount on it
2478000	2480000	Because I have friends in low places
2480000	2482000	On the Playstation 2, Shining Force EXA
2482000	2484000	And Shining Wind get price reductions into the best series
2484000	2486000	But if you want to check out something new
2486000	2488000	You can check out Poi Hito Natsu no Kaiken
2488000	2490000	That comes out in regular and limited edition formats
2490000	2492000	From Idea Factory
2492000	2494000	And taking a look at the handhelds
2494000	2496000	There is a ton of stuff coming out
2496000	2498000	Including
2498000	2500000	Dragon Quest 5
2500000	2502000	And I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be all over that one
2502000	2504000	And there's even like matching cases
2504000	2506000	And protectors to match that
2506000	2508000	It's going to be pretty awesome
2508000	2510000	The game Exit gets a DS port as well
2510000	2512000	That's actually in Korea however
2512000	2514000	Also
2514000	2516000	You know I got to get this, Hello Kitty
2516000	2518000	No Panda Sports Stadium comes out
2518000	2520000	On the DS as well as Metal Slug 7
2520000	2522000	Comes out this week in Japan
2522000	2524000	And with the Hello Kitty game
2524000	2526000	Some new Hello Kitty pouches
2526000	2528000	In pink and white so you can carry
2528000	2530000	Your game and style
2530000	2532000	And if that doesn't work for you
2532000	2534000	How about the Sugar Bunnies pouch
2534000	2536000	That comes out in blue and pink
2536000	2538000	It's a very girly week in the Nintendo DS world
2538000	2540000	But hey at least you have Metal Gear on Playstation 3
2540000	2542000	To counteract that
2542000	2544000	And on the PSP
2544000	2546000	There's some stuff over there too
2546000	2548000	Gundam Battle Universe makes its way out to the PSP
2548000	2550000	And if that's not your style
2550000	2552000	Hime Hibe Princess Days Portable is more
2552000	2554000	Up your alley coming out on
2554000	2556000	July 17th on the PSP
2556000	2558000	That's your Japanese release date
2558000	2560000	I was mesmerized
2560000	2562000	I know, awesome
2562000	2564000	I have four games
2564000	2566000	That are going to be out in the next week
2566000	2568000	And I'm going to go ahead and name one for next Sunday too
2568000	2570000	Just because by the time I
2570000	2572000	Say anything on that day it'd be too late
2572000	2574000	So given that it'll be the next day already
2574000	2576000	So for
2576000	2578000	The UK we have three games
2578000	2580000	On the 18th we have, well actually two
2580000	2582000	Different systems
2582000	2584000	Baroque on PS2 and Wii
2584000	2586000	And Guitar Hero on Tour on
2586000	2588000	DS which is not all that fun
2588000	2590000	Sorry
2590000	2592000	Spoiler!
2592000	2594000	And then on the 20th CID 925
2594000	2596000	An Ordinary Life on PSP
2598000	2600000	Small week for Europe, sadly
2600000	2602000	Very small
2602000	2604000	But also I think our Europe releases they really only cover the big
2604000	2606000	Big stuff and not a lot of the little
2606000	2608000	Stuff like we have over in Japan
2608000	2610000	This list we use has everything
2610000	2612000	On it, not
2612000	2614000	Not necessarily all AAA titles
2614000	2616000	How about Virtual Console over in the
2616000	2618000	UK? We do have some fun
2618000	2620000	For the Virtual Console
2620000	2622000	The first one
2622000	2624000	Sorry I love the description
2624000	2626000	That Eurogamer gives it
2626000	2628000	I'm going to quote
2628000	2630000	The first of these is Ninja Commando
2630000	2632000	A top down vertically scrolling shooter
2632000	2634000	That has ninja and commandos and time travel
2634000	2636000	It also has a rubbish but very funny English translation
2636000	2638000	That's the best description ever
2638000	2640000	I cracked up when I saw it
2640000	2642000	Ninjas, commandos, what else do you need?
2642000	2644000	Time travel!
2644000	2646000	Now what else do you need? That's it
2646000	2648000	A rubbish English translation
2648000	2650000	Perfect, everything I want in a game
2650000	2652000	Make your time
2652000	2654000	Art of Fighting 2 is
2654000	2656000	Another one which is just a
2656000	2658000	Fighting game but it
2658000	2660000	Had
2660000	2662000	Tons of jokes for Capcom came from that
2662000	2664000	Do you know the Art of Fighting?
2664000	2666000	And it's
2666000	2668000	The game series that also spawned us are
2668000	2670000	Dan Hibiki
2670000	2672000	It has a fighter named after me, that's all I need
2672000	2674000	Robert
2674000	2676000	Hello
2676000	2678000	You should cosplay him
2678000	2680000	No thank you
2680000	2682000	Anyway, the Neo Geo games are going to be
2682000	2684000	900 Wii points
2684000	2686000	Translating to 9 euros
2686000	2688000	Or 6 pounds 30
2688000	2690000	So go get them
2690000	2692000	That's an order
2692000	2694000	After E3 you should probably have some more fun
2694000	2696000	Yep
2696000	2698000	Now I'm sure this came to a big surprise to everybody
2698000	2700000	This morning but
2700000	2702000	Microsoft has confirmed that guess what
2702000	2704000	The Xbox 360 20 gig
2704000	2706000	Pro system
2706000	2708000	Has dropped in price to $299
2708000	2710000	I am so surprised
2710000	2712000	That is a big shocker
2712000	2714000	And also surprising and completely not already leaked
2714000	2716000	Already
2716000	2718000	That there will be introducing a new
2718000	2720000	Big console that's going to be
2720000	2722000	Arriving early August
2722000	2724000	That will be the current $349
2724000	2726000	So they're not really dropping
2726000	2728000	The price, they're just kind of
2728000	2730000	Upgrading for the same price
2730000	2732000	So at the press conference tomorrow you guys
2732000	2734000	Act surprised
2734000	2736000	Just act surprised
2736000	2738000	Exactly
2738000	2740000	Especially when they mention the avatars
2740000	2742000	And stuff, pretend that you didn't hear it already
2742000	2744000	Or that you didn't hear about
2744000	2746000	Some of the lips rumors leaking out
2746000	2748000	There on the internet
2748000	2750000	We have never heard of this game called Lips
2750000	2752000	That apparently is under development
2752000	2754000	But here's the thing
2754000	2756000	Variety magazine which is a magazine
2756000	2758000	Really for the industry of entertainment
2758000	2760000	It covers mostly movies, television, music
2760000	2762000	That stuff, but it does dabble in gaming
2762000	2764000	And it talked in a recent article
2764000	2766000	About the Lips project
2766000	2768000	So hello, if that wasn't confirmation
2768000	2770000	What do you need
2770000	2772000	It is going to be at E3
2772000	2774000	Apparently some of the box art has leaked out
2774000	2776000	I wouldn't say that, but the wireless microphones
2776000	2778000	Have apparently leaked out as well
2778000	2780000	So that's pretty cool that they're wireless microphones
2780000	2782000	But get this, I love this
2782000	2784000	The microphones apparently have lights in them
2784000	2786000	At the base of the microphone have these
2786000	2788000	Colored lights that are supposedly
2788000	2790000	I guess they're two rings of
2790000	2792000	Light that are blue or red
2792000	2794000	And apparently the way you sing
2794000	2796000	Controls the lights
2796000	2798000	So I guess it's one of those things
2798000	2800000	Where maybe it's red most of the time
2800000	2802000	I think the blue or red are just to indicate
2802000	2804000	Which player it is
2804000	2806000	Because they have the same kind of thing
2806000	2808000	On SingStar
2808000	2810000	What's interesting, and you may not remember that
2810000	2812000	From the leaked survey that was out there
2812000	2814000	But they're supposed to be motion sensitive
2814000	2816000	Those microphones
2816000	2818000	And they allow you to
2818000	2820000	In the game you're supposed to be singing and dancing
2820000	2822000	And it's supposed to pick up the movement
2822000	2824000	Oh god
2824000	2826000	Get ready to look like an ass in your living room
2826000	2828000	I'll pitch you anything
2828000	2830000	That little camera works with the game too
2830000	2832000	Well I hope it works with something
2832000	2834000	Because you know
2834000	2836000	I paid good money for that camera
2836000	2838000	Exactly, and now we hardly ever get to use it
2838000	2840000	But no, this game does sound cool already
2840000	2842000	I'm very curious to see
2842000	2844000	What the actual game itself
2844000	2846000	Because even though we've seen the box art, we've seen the mics
2846000	2848000	We've seen the concept, we know it's probably
2848000	2850000	Most likely being developed by the Elite Beat agents
2850000	2852000	Folks, we have yet to see screens
2852000	2854000	But tomorrow at E3 we should get some screens
2854000	2856000	I'm gonna take a wild guess here
2856000	2858000	And call me a psychic
2858000	2860000	But I'm gonna guess that they're gonna look
2860000	2862000	Something very similar to
2862000	2864000	Sing Star, Karaoke Revolution
2864000	2866000	Rock Band
2866000	2868000	And probably Guitar Hero World Tour
2868000	2870000	It would be rad though if it was something
2870000	2872000	Kinda different, you never know
2872000	2874000	Except it probably won't be
2874000	2876000	It probably won't
2876000	2878000	Stop it Debbie Downer
2878000	2880000	Raining on my parade
2880000	2882000	Gerardimo says if you sing badly, do you get a light show?
2882000	2884000	Chat.orangelandtrader.com
2884000	2886000	That'd be kinda cool
2886000	2888000	Why should you get a
2888000	2890000	Why do you deserve a light show if you suck?
2890000	2892000	I don't know, maybe it's
2892000	2894000	Consolation Prize, who knows
2894000	2896000	But Lips, that's one of the titles
2896000	2898000	I can't wait to hear about at Microsoft Press Conference
2898000	2900000	Well
2900000	2902000	You'll have to wait, I'm sorry Rob
2902000	2904000	I know, but it's being
2904000	2906000	It's being streamed online like everywhere
2906000	2908000	And it's supposed to be on TV and all this stuff
2908000	2910000	I'm gonna watch it during work tomorrow
2910000	2912000	Sadly I have to teach tomorrow
2912000	2914000	So I can't watch the conference during work
2914000	2916000	I'm gonna be refreshing some of the gaming blogs
2916000	2918000	On my break to see what's announced
2918000	2920000	Well how is this for some happy information
2920000	2922000	Mega Man 9
2922000	2924000	Is actually
2924000	2926000	They said it was gonna be
2926000	2928000	WiiWare coming onto Xbox Live Arcade
2928000	2930000	And PlayStation Network
2930000	2932000	That's gonna be kinda weird
2932000	2934000	Playing a Nintendo style game on Xbox Live
2934000	2936000	But that's cool
2936000	2938000	Now I don't have to worry about storage issues
2938000	2940000	On my Wii, hooray
2940000	2942000	It could be some sort of HD version though
2942000	2944000	It sucks for you
2944000	2946000	It sucks for you Nintendo cause I was gonna buy that game
2946000	2948000	And now I'm not
2948000	2950000	But for anyone who's gonna get it on Wii
2950000	2952000	It's gonna be about 10 bucks and there is a trailer floating around
2952000	2954000	So go find it
2954000	2956000	I did watch the trailer for the game and it lets you see
2956000	2958000	What some of the boss monsters look like
2958000	2960000	Cause you see little silhouettes of them
2960000	2962000	I wonder if this thing looks like a mantis
2962000	2964000	Splash Woman for the record looks like
2964000	2966000	Kind of a mermaid-ish looking thing
2966000	2968000	More like a naga, she looks like Lady Vash
2968000	2970000	Actually
2970000	2972000	Warcraft joke, but I'm serious
2972000	2974000	That's what she kinda looked like in the trailer
2974000	2976000	Like one of those Poseidon ladies
2976000	2978000	And some of the other robots are kinda cool too
2978000	2980000	You can only see their silhouettes
2980000	2982000	But I am all kinds of excited about Mega Man 9
2982000	2984000	I would be more excited if they come out at E3 and say
2984000	2986000	It's available now
2986000	2988000	But I doubt it seeing as we've already heard rumors
2988000	2990000	Of a September release date
2990000	2992000	Still, that's not that far off
2992000	2994000	Something else that's not very far off too
2994000	2996000	Is a rumored
2996000	2998000	Silver DS system
2998000	3000000	Which will be coming out in the US
3000000	3002000	Now
3002000	3004000	The story actually is coming from
3004000	3006000	Go Nintendo
3006000	3008000	They have a source that says
3008000	3010000	That the
3010000	3012000	I guess the DS that was with
3012000	3014000	Guitar Hero
3014000	3016000	That bundle that came out
3016000	3018000	Is gonna be hitting stores
3018000	3020000	I don't know what they're talking about
3020000	3022000	I mean that's totally news to me
3022000	3024000	Yeah
3024000	3026000	I would be very surprised
3026000	3028000	If we saw it like in September or something
3028000	3030000	And it was actually the silver and black DS
3030000	3032000	That was with the Guitar Hero bundle
3032000	3034000	That would be really surprising
3034000	3036000	Wouldn't that be neat?
3036000	3038000	That would be neat. Surprising.
3038000	3040000	Completely surprised.
3040000	3042000	Just as surprising as Microsoft's price
3042000	3044000	Conference will be tomorrow.
3044000	3046000	But folks do really need more colors for the DS
3046000	3048000	I mean seriously.
3048000	3050000	I guess they're still selling
3050000	3052000	What about Wii colors?
3052000	3054000	You think Nintendo's gonna give us some Wii colors finally?
3054000	3056000	Not that I'd go buy a new Wii
3056000	3058000	Just because it's a different color
3058000	3060000	They won't change the color of the Wii
3060000	3062000	Until it starts dropping in sales or
3062000	3064000	Flattening out
3064000	3066000	If they release a pink Wii
3066000	3068000	I would actually consider it for a little bit
3068000	3070000	Maybe I could find a good place
3070000	3072000	A good home for my current white, boring Wii
3072000	3074000	Who knows. Speaking of rumors
3074000	3076000	It's something that's definitely all around this week
3076000	3078000	And kinda interesting
3078000	3080000	Apparently Duke Nukem 3D
3080000	3082000	Xbox Live Arcade screenshots
3082000	3084000	Are floating around out there
3084000	3086000	I guess this is being shown
3086000	3088000	Or this is being lifted off of that whole
3088000	3090000	What do they call that? Partner net?
3090000	3092000	The game costs
3092000	3094000	Supposedly 1,337
3094000	3096000	Microsoft points, which I'm sure is a joke
3096000	3098000	Same for the trial though too
3098000	3100000	Actually gonna charge that, yeah
3100000	3102000	But it also kinda makes you go
3102000	3104000	Hmm, could it be a photoshop?
3104000	3106000	It could be a photoshop
3106000	3108000	But what's interesting about it is that apparently
3108000	3110000	Some achievements have also leaked for the game
3110000	3112000	The world looks like a cleanup on aisle 4
3112000	3114000	Is the achievement
3114000	3116000	And to get that
3116000	3118000	You have to step in a pile of poop
3118000	3120000	I wish I was joking
3120000	3122000	But that is really the achievement
3122000	3124000	And the picture of the achievement
3124000	3126000	Looks like a pile of poop
3126000	3128000	Which makes me think
3128000	3130000	This is even more of a fake, but you never know
3130000	3132000	They had poop in the game
3132000	3134000	Yeah I know, but if these screenshots
3134000	3136000	Are fake, it's a damn good fake
3136000	3138000	I'll give them that
3138000	3140000	But we'll find out
3140000	3142000	I'm sure tomorrow
3142000	3144000	Would you think that this might be
3144000	3146000	One of their games, like they did this with Doom
3146000	3148000	Didn't they? Then they come out at some European
3148000	3150000	We can't have 5 Xbox Live arcade games
3150000	3152000	Coming out tomorrow, or next week
3152000	3154000	Sure we could
3154000	3156000	I would like that, but we can't
3156000	3158000	I think we all would
3158000	3160000	Especially something like Duke Nukem
3160000	3162000	Dude, if Duke Nukem comes out on the Xbox 360
3162000	3164000	I am buying that game day one
3164000	3166000	I am fucking there
3166000	3168000	I really hope it's not one of those things
3168000	3170000	Where I buy it and then I go
3170000	3172000	This was so much cooler when I was 12
3172000	3174000	Like Doom was
3174000	3176000	Doom, I never really played much of Doom
3176000	3178000	Duke Nukem was awesome
3178000	3180000	I played that for hours
3180000	3182000	We're so playing some Duke Nukem when this comes out
3182000	3184000	Loki, I hope it's not a fake
3184000	3186000	And if it is a fake
3186000	3188000	Whoever faked it, I hope you burn in hell
3188000	3190000	For getting my hopes up
3190000	3192000	I hope you step in many piles of poop
3192000	3194000	For the rest of your life
3194000	3196000	And the Middle Eastern curse that applies
3196000	3198000	May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals
3198000	3200000	Yes, and poop
3200000	3202000	In your genitals
3202000	3204000	Haha, poop in your genitals
3206000	3208000	This show is rated T for trashy
3208000	3210000	For all the toilet humor
3210000	3212000	It's rated P for poo-poo
3212000	3214000	Speaking of poo-poo
3214000	3216000	Hey
3218000	3220000	No, I wasn't talking about you
3220000	3222000	I was talking about someone else
3222000	3224000	That thankfully doesn't come on this program
3224000	3226000	The king of poopy headedness
3226000	3228000	Which would be
3228000	3230000	He who shall not be named
3230000	3232000	I'll have you know
3232000	3234000	And this is just a funny little bit of trivia
3234000	3236000	That chat room that I put together
3236000	3238000	For the PSP site
3238000	3240000	The only bad word filter that's on there
3240000	3242000	Is Jack Thompson
3242000	3244000	And it will actually change it to
3244000	3246000	Lord Voldemort for you
3246000	3248000	Well done, Loki, well done
3248000	3250000	Alright, so yes, what is the latest in
3250000	3252000	your world?
3252000	3254000	Well, the judge
3254000	3256000	Who is
3256000	3258000	I think is in charge of the trial
3258000	3260000	Dava Tunis, I guess is the name
3260000	3262000	Has referred to
3262000	3264000	He who shall not be named
3264000	3266000	As mentally impaired
3266000	3268000	And
3268000	3270000	A raving wild
3270000	3272000	woman
3272000	3274000	Wait, a raving wild woman?
3274000	3276000	No, Nick Thompson referred to her as that
3276000	3278000	I'm sorry, I gotcha
3278000	3280000	He referred to her as mentally impaired and a raving wild woman
3280000	3282000	My bad
3282000	3284000	I wish a judge would refer to him as a raving wild woman
3284000	3286000	You crazy bitch, sit down
3286000	3288000	Well, the judge
3288000	3290000	Has recommended that Tom
3290000	3292000	That dude be assessed
3292000	3294000	$43,675
3294000	3296000	Fine for legal
3296000	3298000	Costs incurred by the Florida bar
3298000	3300000	And he has been found guilty
3300000	3302000	Of 27 of 31 charges
3302000	3304000	In a misconduct
3304000	3306000	Suit and
3306000	3308000	The judge wants him disbarred
3308000	3310000	I love that they have it figured out
3310000	3312000	Down to the dollar
3312000	3314000	You know what would make that even better?
3314000	3316000	If it was figured out down to the cent
3316000	3318000	It is figured out down to the cent, actually
3318000	3320000	On Kotaku, they had the cents
3320000	3322000	It was like
3322000	3324000	$36.35 or something
3324000	3326000	It was 35 cents, I remember that
3326000	3328000	Hugs and kisses to the folks who made that happen
3328000	3330000	He should be forced to pay it on site
3330000	3332000	To me?
3332000	3334000	No, to the Florida bar
3334000	3336000	Alright, fine
3336000	3338000	But then to me
3338000	3340000	He is just a fucker
3340000	3342000	And you know what
3342000	3344000	As much as this is actually
3344000	3346000	Kind of good news in a way
3346000	3348000	That maybe he will finally be forced to go away
3348000	3350000	Although I am sure he will troll all the blogs still
3350000	3352000	Just hearing that name
3352000	3354000	Lord Voldemort inspires fear
3354000	3356000	And anger in me
3356000	3358000	So we will be getting to the FUs of the week soon
3358000	3360000	But there is more, apparently
3360000	3362000	I just wanted to read the actual first
3362000	3364000	Line on this one
3364000	3366000	Because I actually did check on Game Politics
3366000	3368000	It says the Florida bar has recommended disbarment
3368000	3370000	For a period of 10 years
3370000	3372000	This court respectfully declines to follow
3372000	3374000	The bar's recommendation
3374000	3376000	The case involves
3376000	3378000	Factual findings of cumulative misconduct
3378000	3380000	A repeated pattern of behavior
3380000	3382000	Relentlessly forced upon numerous
3382000	3384000	Unconnected individuals
3384000	3386000	A total lack of remorse
3386000	3388000	Or even slight acknowledgement of inappropriate conduct
3388000	3390000	So
3390000	3392000	So
3392000	3394000	The bottom two things
3394000	3396000	I will go ahead and skip to the last paragraph
3396000	3398000	Thus after careful consideration
3398000	3400000	Of the underlying facts and the
3400000	3402000	Instant cases
3402000	3404000	Together with the Florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions
3404000	3406000	And applicable aggravating and mitigating factors
3406000	3408000	In the precedent case law
3408000	3410000	This court makes the following recommendations for John Bruce Thompson
3410000	3412000	His middle name is Bruce
3412000	3414000	Flees in your pants
3414000	3416000	In your genitals
3416000	3418000	A. Permanent disbarment with no leave to reapply for admission
3418000	3420000	B. Disciplinary costs
3420000	3422000	Currently totalling
3422000	3424000	$43,675.35
3424000	3426000	Nice
3426000	3428000	Currently totalling
3428000	3430000	Can we burn on the angst now?
3430000	3432000	Can we burn on the angst now?
3446000	3448000	Apparently news about
3448000	3450000	Lord of Voldemort makes you gassy
3450000	3452000	I was opening my mouth to say something
3452000	3454000	And it said I had a juice burp
3454000	3456000	Nice
3456000	3458000	Multi-part F.U. Number 1
3458000	3460000	The heat returning
3460000	3462000	And
3462000	3464000	Number 2
3466000	3468000	To people
3468000	3470000	Who think
3470000	3472000	That they have the right
3472000	3474000	To tell someone else
3474000	3476000	What to say or do or think
3476000	3478000	Just because they themselves are offended
3478000	3480000	You know what I mean?
3480000	3482000	Why don't people learn how to fucking
3482000	3484000	Roll with the punches?
3484000	3486000	No
3486000	3488000	Not in general
3488000	3490000	It's just in general
3490000	3492000	At a point of saturation
3492000	3494000	Where I'm just sick with all these people
3494000	3496000	Who are like
3496000	3498000	I don't like what you did Sue
3498000	3500000	Or
3500000	3502000	You said a mean thing about me
3502000	3504000	And Sue
3504000	3506000	And just people who
3506000	3508000	Don't know how to get the fuck over themselves
3508000	3510000	And get on with it
3510000	3512000	You know what?
3512000	3514000	Since somebody says something shitty about you
3514000	3516000	Why should it matter?
3516000	3518000	And also on the same lines
3518000	3520000	F.U. to anyone
3520000	3522000	Now I'm going to say fuck you to anyone who tries to tell me
3522000	3524000	How I should talk
3524000	3526000	This is America
3526000	3528000	There's nothing in the Constitution
3528000	3530000	That limits my ability to say
3530000	3532000	Fuck, shit, damn, cock or any other
3532000	3534000	So-called curse word that I wish to say
3534000	3536000	In any type of form
3536000	3538000	Unless it is specifically said
3538000	3540000	As part of a private organization
3540000	3542000	That these words are not allowed
3542000	3544000	As part of my employment say
3544000	3546000	That's fine
3546000	3548000	But I can stand outside of my place of employment and go
3548000	3550000	Fuck!
3550000	3552000	All I want to
3552000	3554000	And it's legal
3554000	3556000	And by the way DarkSakura
3556000	3558000	The lawyers will be calling about the lawsuit with the fleas in my genitals
3558000	3560000	I also plan on
3560000	3562000	Cursing in front of my children
3562000	3564000	I'll tell you why
3564000	3566000	The Osborn kids came down only slightly fucked up
3566000	3568000	I had a discussion about this with my friend
3568000	3570000	Who's a parent as well
3570000	3572000	She's not going to have any problem with
3572000	3574000	You know, say if a kid falls and goes
3574000	3576000	Oh damn, or shit that hurts
3576000	3578000	She's not going to have a problem with it
3578000	3580000	But have a problem if someone uses it specifically in a
3580000	3582000	Derogatory or attacking way
3582000	3584000	So teach someone to be nice
3584000	3586000	You can learn when it's appropriate
3586000	3588000	When it's not appropriate
3588000	3590000	But I'm not going to discourage my children
3590000	3592000	If I ever have any
3592000	3594000	To have to curtail their own freedom of speech
3594000	3596000	For somebody else's comfort
3596000	3598000	I don't have kids yet
3598000	3600000	Maybe someday, but I'm still thinking
3600000	3602000	Kind of a similar thing because
3602000	3604000	If you don't make it such a bad thing
3604000	3606000	Then kids won't want to do it
3606000	3608000	You know, half the reason why I think
3608000	3610000	That a lot of
3610000	3612000	Kids act out about stuff or try to be rebellious
3612000	3614000	Kids, I'm sorry, they're going to look for something
3614000	3616000	To be rebellious about
3616000	3618000	You say don't cuss, they're just going to start cussing like a sailor
3618000	3620000	That's the truth
3620000	3622000	I think that if you set the example
3622000	3624000	That say, well
3624000	3626000	It's not something to get worked up over
3626000	3628000	If we don't care
3628000	3630000	Then they're not going to try to do it to get attention
3630000	3632000	Just give them the proper attention that they need
3632000	3634000	Misty in chat says, see that's another reason
3634000	3636000	I don't have an intention of having
3636000	3638000	Demon spawn
3638000	3640000	I'm actually thinking in the next two years
3640000	3642000	Oh my heck
3642000	3644000	That could be something
3644000	3646000	Alright, Loki, your F.E. is the week
3646000	3648000	And I'm going to probably still be here every Sunday
3648000	3650000	With the baby?
3650000	3652000	Maybe
3652000	3654000	No, I'm going to make Dan babysit
3654000	3656000	Anyway, Loki
3656000	3658000	F.E. is the PSP web browser for sucking
3658000	3660000	That's all I got
3660000	3662000	Yeah, mine's short too
3662000	3664000	F.U. to smoke, and I don't mean the fighter
3664000	3666000	In Mortal Kombat 3 or 4 or whatever
3666000	3668000	Even though he kind of sucked too
3668000	3670000	I'm talking about the smoke that's out there in the air
3670000	3672000	Like a fucking volcano blew up in my backyard
3672000	3674000	It's pretty horrible
3674000	3676000	And thankfully I don't still live up in Chico
3676000	3678000	Where all the fires are happening
3678000	3680000	Because I hear up in Chico it's raining ash
3680000	3682000	Can you imagine if you walked outside one day and it's raining ash
3682000	3684000	That sucks
3684000	3686000	It's like you are actually living in hell
3686000	3688000	For Dante's Peak
3688000	3690000	Without
3690000	3692000	Or Pompeii the day before
3692000	3694000	Yeah, without
3694000	3696000	Frickin' what's-her-name-for-the-Terminator
3696000	3698000	Being there
3698000	3700000	Alright, alright
3700000	3702000	Well
3702000	3704000	There's more rumors
3704000	3706000	We have to say this, I'm sorry
3706000	3708000	Gulp Banjo in chat says
3708000	3710000	Jamie, have the baby live on air
3710000	3712000	It can be an educational thing
3712000	3714000	The miracle of life
3714000	3716000	Really?
3716000	3718000	I've already discussed it
3718000	3722000	When I do squirt out my own demon spawn
3722000	3726000	I'm going to have a midwife and do it at home
3726000	3728000	When the parasite crawls out
3728000	3730000	Actually it's funny, my friend
3730000	3732000	Becky is so awesome
3732000	3734000	We kept referring to her baby as her symbiote
3734000	3736000	Alright, look
3736000	3738000	We've got to get back to gaming
3738000	3740000	We'll have baby chat another time
3740000	3742000	You know the big reason why you don't want to have babies?
3742000	3744000	What?
3744000	3746000	When you have a baby hanging out around that part of the body
3746000	3748000	It shoves the rest of your organs up behind your ribcage
3748000	3750000	That's why moms get heartburn
3750000	3752000	It's true
3752000	3754000	Loki
3754000	3756000	Loki, less baby, more game
3758000	3760000	Well, these controllers
3760000	3762000	You may be able to use it to shove organs of your enemies
3762000	3764000	Up into their ribcage
3764000	3766000	But, I don't know
3766000	3768000	Anyways, there's a rumor
3768000	3770000	There's still rumors going around that
3770000	3772000	Microsoft's going to reveal some sort of motion controllers
3772000	3774000	And if that's true
3774000	3776000	Then they're thinking that maybe that these
3776000	3778000	Motus Games
3778000	3780000	Darwin controllers are actually
3780000	3782000	The 360 motion controllers
3782000	3784000	Well, there's a few reasons why they may think that
3784000	3786000	One, the controllers kind of fit the color scheme
3786000	3788000	They are white plastic
3788000	3790000	And they've got
3790000	3792000	Four lights on them indicating that you can use
3792000	3794000	Four at one time
3794000	3796000	Which kind of makes them a little bit different
3796000	3798000	Than say the Wii remote and stuff like that
3798000	3800000	They're kind of
3800000	3802000	I don't know
3802000	3804000	You can attach them to each other
3804000	3806000	So you can take two of them and break them apart
3806000	3808000	Or make them into one giant
3808000	3810000	Remote, which is kind of weird
3810000	3812000	But, they have
3812000	3814000	Some video kind of showing off
3814000	3816000	Because right now these are only for the PC
3816000	3818000	Showing them
3818000	3820000	Being used like Tiger Woods
3820000	3822000	Lego, Star Wars
3822000	3824000	Stuff like that
3824000	3826000	So they look pretty cool
3826000	3828000	And they work pretty much just like the Wii Remote and Nunchuck
3828000	3830000	But they are wireless, which is nice
3830000	3832000	So you don't have a stupid cord tethering you together
3832000	3834000	I don't know
3834000	3836000	I guess we'll find out tomorrow
3836000	3838000	Or today, depending on when you listen to the podcast
3838000	3840000	Alright, stay tuned
3840000	3842000	I'm sure we'll be talking a lot about the E3 announcements next week
3842000	3844000	Do you think
3844000	3846000	Microsoft getting into motion control is a good thing?
3846000	3848000	I don't know
3848000	3850000	I don't know, it would depend on how they did it
3850000	3852000	And I'd hopefully
3852000	3854000	It would be optional stuff
3854000	3856000	Do you think that they would try to release a Wii Sports
3856000	3858000	Style game as like their passion game
3858000	3860000	Or do you think that would be completely obvious?
3860000	3862000	I think that would be kind of stupid
3862000	3864000	But, I could see if they did
3864000	3866000	Put out motion control or that you would get a lot more
3866000	3868000	Of those crappy games on the 360
3868000	3870000	Maybe
3870000	3872000	Xbox Live Arcade titles and stuff?
3872000	3874000	That wouldn't be too bad
3874000	3876000	I just worry because they don't really support
3876000	3878000	The camera they put out
3878000	3880000	There's a couple games that use it
3880000	3882000	But that's really it
3882000	3884000	But their whole thing right now
3884000	3886000	Is they're trying to get a piece of that
3886000	3888000	Casual market that Nintendo seems to have
3888000	3890000	Kind of a hold of
3890000	3892000	I think what's more interesting
3892000	3894000	Is
3894000	3896000	What's Sony gonna do?
3896000	3898000	You know, because they want to get into the casual market
3898000	3900000	As well, and we haven't heard too much about
3900000	3902000	What they're gonna do
3902000	3904000	And there were rumors a long time ago about new controllers
3904000	3906000	And stuff like that
3906000	3908000	That they're gonna do something too
3908000	3910000	Who knows?
3910000	3912000	We'll see
3912000	3914000	In the meantime, we know this game is coming out
3914000	3916000	But it's been getting a facelift
3916000	3918000	And a lot of people were like
3918000	3920000	Cool, that's gonna be awesome
3920000	3922000	When Beer Pong
3922000	3924000	Did you hear about this? It was frat party games
3924000	3926000	Beer Pong
3926000	3928000	It was gonna be coming out for WiiWare
3928000	3930000	Like an actual Beer Pong game
3930000	3932000	Who doesn't love Beer Pong at their local frat party?
3932000	3934000	Apparently, the game was rated T
3934000	3936000	So what happened? The game was completely
3936000	3938000	Reworked
3938000	3940000	It was rated M
3940000	3942000	And now they gotta rate it T
3942000	3944000	So all the
3944000	3946000	References to booze were taken out of the game
3946000	3948000	And now the game is Pong Toss
3948000	3950000	Pong Toss
3950000	3952000	Instead of Beer Pong
3952000	3954000	You get Pong Toss, but you know, whatever
3954000	3956000	I think either way the game's gonna gotta be hokey
3956000	3958000	I mean, if you're gonna play Beer Pong, fuck it, play Beer Pong
3958000	3960000	You don't have to play it on your Wii
3960000	3962000	Or if you're 21 and over only, please
3962000	3964000	If you really do wanna play it on your Wii
3964000	3966000	Just, there's a game out right now
3966000	3968000	Called Game Party
3968000	3970000	It's like 20 bucks
3970000	3972000	And it sucks
3972000	3974000	I mean, I think it sucks compared to everything else
3974000	3976000	So if you really wanna play this, you can probably find that game
3976000	3978000	For dirt cheap
3978000	3980000	So just buy that
3980000	3982000	I don't know
3982000	3984000	I will
3984000	3986000	We'll see
3986000	3988000	How much is that? This one's supposed to be on the marketplace?
3988000	3990000	Do we know? Probably like 5 or 10 bucks
3990000	3992000	5, cause, we'll see
3992000	3994000	10 is way too much for that
3994000	3996000	Okay, now we're gonna get to the mailbag part of the program
3996000	3998000	This is the part where you can send in your emails
3998000	4000000	Every week to mailbagorangelandtrader.com
4000000	4002000	And we read them live on air for our amusement
4002000	4004000	And to poke fun at you
4004000	4006000	No, just kidding, but if you ask a good question, we'll answer it
4006000	4008000	So let's open up the old mailbag, Dark Sakura
4008000	4010000	See what the listeners have to say
4012000	4014000	Wii has letters
4014000	4016000	But only three
4016000	4018000	Four, sorry
4018000	4020000	Short mailbag
4020000	4022000	Well, we got a letter from Rob with two B's
4022000	4024000	Yay, Rob with two B's
4024000	4026000	It says, this is mostly for Skye and Loki
4026000	4028000	Because DS dropped me already
4028000	4030000	I did not drop you
4030000	4032000	I'm telling you right now, I did not drop you
4032000	4034000	That's Dan's friends list
4034000	4038000	I was using Dan's friends list with him for a while
4038000	4040000	And he has removed people that he does not know
4040000	4042000	So that was not me, it was my husband
4042000	4044000	Is this an Xbox Live thing?
4044000	4046000	Yes
4046000	4048000	I did not drop you
4048000	4050000	I did not drop you
4050000	4052000	I know, it makes it sound like we dropped him
4052000	4054000	Like a two dollar hooker, and that's not the case
4054000	4056000	Drop the bomb
4056000	4058000	It's not that I want to be dropped
4058000	4060000	But rather that I don't play many online games
4060000	4062000	The only decent but humbling online play
4062000	4064000	Was with Rob and friends on Halo 2
4064000	4066000	Whenever I play online, I get overwhelmed by radical and social epithets
4066000	4068000	So there's little incentive to go online
4070000	4072000	If I ever become a big online game player
4072000	4074000	In a particular game that one of you has
4074000	4076000	I may re-request later
4076000	4078000	Also my second Xbox 360 died
4078000	4080000	So I haven't played anything on it for a while
4080000	4082000	By the way
4082000	4084000	I do have my own gamertag
4084000	4086000	I don't use it, but as soon as I remember what it is
4086000	4088000	I'll let you know
4088000	4090000	And I won't delete you
4090000	4092000	On an unrelated note
4092000	4094000	Did you try to switch your controller assignment from 1 to 2
4094000	4096000	When fighting Screaming Mantis
4096000	4098000	On Metal Gear Solid 4, hilarity ensues
4098000	4100000	I personally didn't enjoy the
4100000	4102000	Swap to disc 2 joke
4102000	4104000	Because the loading to hard drive screens
4104000	4106000	Are more painful than swapping discs
4106000	4108000	What a dang good point
4108000	4110000	What a good point Rob brings up
4110000	4112000	Is that, you know, don't joke about the disc swapping
4112000	4114000	Thing and the whole, this is blu-ray
4114000	4116000	When the game has a freaking install
4116000	4118000	Good point
4118000	4120000	And I don't see the need to delete Rob
4120000	4122000	But hey, look, that one game of Halo 2
4122000	4124000	Is more than I've played with some people
4124000	4126000	And that was fun
4126000	4128000	I had no idea
4128000	4130000	Blame Dan
4130000	4132000	I blame him for everything
4132000	4134000	Alright, good job
4134000	4136000	This is from
4136000	4138000	Actdeft
4138000	4140000	Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican Actdeft
4140000	4142000	First of all
4142000	4144000	I have lots of friendly neighborhood Mexicans actually
4144000	4146000	First of all
4146000	4148000	Congrats to your 6th anniversary
4148000	4150000	Which I unfortunately missed
4150000	4152000	And a belated congrats to Rob for his birthday
4152000	4154000	Which I'm getting Rob a present soon
4154000	4156000	Thank you
4156000	4158000	A late present
4158000	4160000	Second
4160000	4162000	Thanks to Rob for remembering me when he
4162000	4164000	Interviewed Tommy Tallarico and asking him
4164000	4166000	At Video Games Live we'll return to
4166000	4168000	Mexicali
4168000	4170000	That was a pretty good interview by the way
4170000	4172000	And it's good to hear he cares for the fans too
4172000	4174000	And well I think that's all
4174000	4176000	Thanks and ciao
4176000	4178000	Yeah it was a long interview but
4178000	4180000	He's definitely
4180000	4182000	Passionate and has
4182000	4184000	He's definitely doing a lot for the video game industry
4184000	4186000	I was kind of surprised
4186000	4188000	You know I kind of thought
4188000	4190000	He was a little more on the
4190000	4192000	Hands off journalist reporting end
4192000	4194000	But he does a lot more hands on than you might know
4194000	4196000	At first especially if you're
4196000	4198000	Especially if you're basing his opinion of him
4198000	4200000	Or if you're basing your opinion of him strictly off of the
4200000	4202000	Judgment Day show
4202000	4204000	Then you're really missing out, that's one thing I learned
4204000	4206000	This email is sponsored in part by
4206000	4208000	Konami, home of Neverending Lawsuits
4208000	4210000	This is Deftest Kebrown
4210000	4212000	I see what you did there
4212000	4214000	Okay
4214000	4216000	Well dun dun dun
4216000	4218000	From Jonathan
4218000	4220000	Dear OLR, I have been a long time listener
4220000	4222000	And have been tuning into your show for a little
4222000	4224000	Over two years now, wow
4224000	4226000	This is my first time writing to you guys
4226000	4228000	And oddly enough I am typing this from the
4228000	4230000	Wii internet browser since my computer practically
4230000	4232000	Died on me
4232000	4234000	Wow, emailing from Wii? Impressive
4234000	4236000	My game systems have come in handy during these months
4236000	4238000	And I think
4238000	4240000	I think it is a blessing that they allow us
4240000	4242000	To do more than just game
4242000	4244000	2 as well as many of your other listeners
4244000	4246000	Use my PSP to get my weekly fix
4246000	4248000	I don't think that you guys do just one
4248000	4250000	Should do just one
4250000	4252000	Big show, I mean it could be great
4252000	4254000	Having it all at once
4254000	4256000	But at the same time as Rob points out
4256000	4258000	We could have spread it out during the week
4258000	4260000	As of late
4260000	4262000	I have found the delays
4262000	4264000	Of part B to be annoying
4264000	4266000	But I understand that things happen, I'm not fussing at Rob
4266000	4268000	But try to get it in on Thursday
4268000	4270000	Or Friday instead of Saturday or Sunday, oh well
4270000	4272000	We've addressed that
4272000	4274000	And hopefully, I know he says he likes having it in two parts
4274000	4276000	But I think the whole
4276000	4278000	Split thing, Ultra Army and the whole
4278000	4280000	Combined thing, we'll try it out
4280000	4282000	If the listeners don't like it, we'll change it back
4282000	4284000	Well anyway I guess this should count from my
4284000	4286000	Fe of the week, but regarding the limited
4286000	4288000	Friends list on Xbox Live, I think
4288000	4290000	That this is total bull
4290000	4292000	People can't be limited to how many friends they can have
4292000	4294000	To game with, and I think that should be
4294000	4296000	Part of the next dashboard update
4296000	4298000	I should, no
4298000	4300000	I know all of your
4300000	4302000	I know all about your
4302000	4304000	Problem Rob, I am on Loki's friends list
4304000	4306000	Though if you need to contact me
4306000	4308000	Okay
4308000	4310000	Also for any OLR listeners who would like to add me
4310000	4312000	My gamertag is unfoldedraptor
4312000	4314000	Jamie I'm sorry if my email
4314000	4316000	Is a bit long for such a great show
4316000	4318000	There is so much to be said, oh thank you
4318000	4320000	Keep up the great work
4320000	4322000	And don't stop believing from Jonathan
4322000	4324000	Florida, home of the never ending supply of dying
4324000	4326000	Elderly
4326000	4328000	Nice
4328000	4330000	That's a little bit horrible
4330000	4332000	But nice
4332000	4334000	The last email is for me
4334000	4336000	Dear Jamie, I know I'm a
4336000	4338000	Dear
4338000	4340000	Thank you so much for choosing Ristar, one of my
4340000	4342000	Favorite classic games of all time
4342000	4344000	As the classic game of the week
4344000	4346000	I feel bad for not being present that evening
4346000	4348000	But I'm really sorry if I made you angry
4348000	4350000	But being able to listen to it on the podcast
4350000	4352000	Was good enough for me
4352000	4354000	And made my day to say the least
4354000	4356000	Hi
4356000	4358000	Sorry
4358000	4360000	That email reminded me to check something else out
4360000	4362000	Yes Rob
4362000	4364000	It is a pity that the audio wasn't working
4364000	4366000	So to make up for it and my absence
4366000	4368000	I will send a few separate emails with attached
4368000	4370000	Zip files that contain all of the great songs
4370000	4372000	From Ristar, including my favorite
4372000	4374000	Shooting Ristar and Ring Rink
4374000	4376000	Which are songs that
4376000	4378000	Play in Act 1 of Planet Florida
4378000	4380000	And Act 1 of Planet Freon
4380000	4382000	Thanks again Osfer, P.S. you win the world
4382000	4384000	Well sadly I'm a little lazy
4384000	4386000	To open up your files and open up the
4386000	4388000	Massive MP3's but the good news is
4388000	4390000	That YouTube appears to be working
4390000	4392000	Tonight so here's a little bit of
4392000	4394000	What you missed out on last week if I can
4394000	4396000	Get a little clip here of the
4396000	4398000	Actual gameplay
4406000	4408000	And if you want to hear more about this game go listen to last week's show
4408000	4410000	That it for email?
4410000	4412000	That be all
4412000	4414000	Alright if you want to email us
4414000	4416000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
4416000	4418000	Meanwhile back to the game news
4418000	4420000	Yes
4420000	4422000	Well
4422000	4424000	I don't know what I should really say about this
4424000	4426000	It's weird
4426000	4428000	And uh
4428000	4430000	Alright well anyways
4430000	4432000	Nintendo has unveiled a brand new
4432000	4434000	I guess
4434000	4436000	I don't know if it's a franchise but
4436000	4438000	Game called
4438000	4440000	Rainbow
4440000	4442000	And it's uh
4442000	4444000	Sounds awesome
4444000	4446000	It's a really strange looking game
4446000	4448000	It kind of looks a little bit like
4448000	4450000	Viewtiful Joe
4450000	4452000	It combines um
4452000	4454000	I guess a mix of action exploration
4454000	4456000	And uh
4456000	4458000	Manga-esque visuals
4458000	4460000	And what's kind of neat about the whole game
4460000	4462000	At least um
4462000	4464000	What they've said so far is that it's filled
4464000	4466000	With like B characters
4466000	4468000	From different games
4468000	4470000	Like for example in the trailer that they had on
4470000	4472000	Wiifolder.com
4472000	4474000	You see Birdo in there
4474000	4476000	Like talking in Japanese and stuff
4476000	4478000	But it's a bunch of weird characters
4478000	4480000	So uh
4480000	4482000	So wait wait it's a brand new IP that borrows from all the other IPs
4482000	4484000	Sort of yeah
4484000	4486000	Which is characters they hope you don't remember
4486000	4488000	Yeah and the main character is
4488000	4490000	This like dude who turns into Captain Rainbow
4490000	4492000	This
4492000	4494000	I don't know
4494000	4496000	Rainbow
4496000	4498000	It's weird looking
4498000	4500000	And uh I guess
4500000	4502000	He has a yo-yo attack
4502000	4504000	Now you know
4504000	4506000	What's more awesome than Captain Rainbow
4506000	4508000	Reading
4508000	4510000	Rainbow
4510000	4512000	I just want to put that out there
4512000	4514000	Wouldn't a Reading Rainbow video game be awesome?
4514000	4516000	One of the other characters I guess was in there
4516000	4518000	As well as the golfer from NES Golf
4518000	4520000	That's kind of rare
4520000	4522000	Wasn't that just Mario?
4522000	4524000	Interesting
4524000	4526000	Anyhow
4526000	4528000	More franchises
4528000	4530000	This is a good thing though
4530000	4532000	They're not just borrowing from all the other old games
4532000	4534000	Capcom is starting a new one as well
4534000	4536000	It's an Xbox Live Arcade game that's coming out
4536000	4538000	It's called Flock
4538000	4540000	Flock is a flocking puzzle game
4540000	4542000	That is apparently
4542000	4544000	It's got to do with like you're in this grid style thing
4544000	4546000	But you're a UFO
4546000	4548000	And you heard these animals
4548000	4550000	And apparently the animals have effects
4550000	4552000	That are affected by
4552000	4554000	Certain parts and levels and the puzzle aspects
4554000	4556000	Apparently this game is supposed to be
4556000	4558000	Kind of like Lemmings
4558000	4560000	Over 50 different stages, co-op online play
4560000	4562000	And a way to edit your own levels in the game
4562000	4564000	Should be pretty neat
4564000	4566000	This is supposed to be their secret project that they were unveiling at E3
4566000	4568000	It doesn't look that cool
4568000	4570000	To be honest
4570000	4572000	Here's a little clip
4572000	4574000	I know video doesn't work that great over the radio
4574000	4576000	But at least you can hear a little of the music
4576000	4578000	Aw it looks cute
4578000	4580000	Their little sheath
4580000	4582000	They're hurting everywhere with the UFO
4582000	4584000	It looks like a cross between like Kirby Golf
4584000	4586000	And Lemmings
4590000	4592000	I'll still play the trial if nothing else
4592000	4594000	It might be cool, you never know
4594000	4596000	Remember folks, dead raisin wee
4598000	4600000	Because they keep saying that's not going to happen
4600000	4602000	But we know better
4602000	4604000	What a flocking interesting announcement
4604000	4606000	Alright so
4606000	4608000	Yeah, Flock coming soon to
4608000	4610000	Xbox Live Arcade
4610000	4612000	That sounds fascinating
4612000	4614000	Especially with the little sheep, that was cute
4614000	4616000	I like the little cheepy sheep
4616000	4618000	Well, some other happy news
4618000	4620000	And it looks like they're not at all I guess that
4620000	4622000	Daunted by the lawsuit
4622000	4624000	But EA was planning on releasing
4624000	4626000	Two new drum kits for Rock Band 2
4626000	4628000	And
4628000	4630000	There will be
4630000	4632000	A
4632000	4634000	Velocity sensitive
4634000	4636000	Drum pad
4636000	4638000	And it won't be as noisy
4638000	4640000	And it will have reinforced metal
4640000	4642000	Pedals
4642000	4644000	And clip on cymbals
4644000	4646000	And the second one is actually licensed by
4646000	4648000	Ion
4648000	4650000	And it's called the Ion Drum Kit
4650000	4652000	It's a fairly expensive one
4652000	4654000	But there are electromagnetic cymbals
4654000	4656000	And adjustable pads
4656000	4658000	And metal frame
4658000	4660000	And it's supposed to be really sweet
4660000	4662000	And expensive
4662000	4664000	There are going to be add on cymbals
4664000	4666000	For the Rock Band drums
4666000	4668000	Hmm, interesting
4668000	4670000	Um, you know
4670000	4672000	If people will pay like 300, 400 bucks
4672000	4674000	For those arcade style Beat Media 2DX
4674000	4676000	And Poppin Music controllers though
4676000	4678000	Why not pay a lot of money for these Ion
4678000	4680000	Super Duper drum sets
4680000	4682000	Although I don't know where the F in my house
4682000	4684000	I would put them
4684000	4686000	Except out here in the garage, for real?
4686000	4688000	I thought the wife hated the drums
4688000	4690000	Well they're at work
4690000	4692000	Ah, I see
4692000	4694000	Boy, you're a real sucker for those peripherals
4694000	4696000	What about you, Dark Soccer? Speaking of suckers for peripherals
4696000	4698000	You've seen the vault!
4698000	4700000	I know, are you going to get these?
4700000	4702000	Just because I want them doesn't mean I'm going to buy them
4702000	4704000	They're 300 dollars, I mean shit
4704000	4706000	That's expensive
4706000	4708000	For 300 dollars, do you know how many days you could feed
4708000	4710000	A starving child somewhere in the world?
4710000	4712000	Probably a year
4712000	4714000	Yeah, why would I want to feed children?
4714000	4716000	Why feed children?
4716000	4718000	Unless they're going to build me a kick ass drum set
4718000	4720000	You could be playing Billy Idol
4720000	4722000	In Rock Band 2
4722000	4724000	It's a nice day for a
4724000	4726000	White wedding
4726000	4728000	Anyhow
4728000	4730000	It's a nice day for some more gaming news too
4730000	4732000	Alright
4732000	4734000	How many times have we heard this rumor
4734000	4736000	That there's going to be an announcement
4736000	4738000	During the Nintendo conference
4738000	4740000	That's going to unveil
4740000	4742000	Animal Crossing Wii
4742000	4744000	I know
4744000	4746000	I think, are we really going to be shocked if it
4746000	4748000	Gets announced?
4748000	4750000	Yes, because it's like OMG it's finally here
4750000	4752000	The more the shock is
4752000	4754000	Is it going to look like
4754000	4756000	It's going to actually be kind of different
4756000	4758000	And more interesting than the DS one
4758000	4760000	I'm guessing they're not innovating on shit
4760000	4762000	Since they didn't innovate on hardly
4762000	4764000	Anything from the DS and
4764000	4766000	GameCube ones
4766000	4768000	I wouldn't be surprised
4768000	4770000	I'll still buy it because I'm a consumer whore
4770000	4772000	Me too
4772000	4774000	The other rumor that's coming out
4774000	4776000	Is Punch Out for the Wii
4776000	4778000	That's kind of a rad surprise
4778000	4780000	Like that was one of the things you didn't really think
4780000	4782000	Of that, but that makes sense
4782000	4784000	If Wii Boxing was so big, why not
4784000	4786000	Throw in the beloved Punch Out characters
4786000	4788000	Mr. Dream
4788000	4790000	Mike Tyson
4790000	4792000	George Foreman
4792000	4794000	Put him in the game
4794000	4796000	I guess, we need to fucking Excite Truck 2
4796000	4798000	Fuck this Punch Out shit
4798000	4800000	We'll see
4800000	4802000	The news conference is only days away
4802000	4804000	So we'll see
4804000	4806000	We'll see
4806000	4808000	Well here's what I'm worried about
4808000	4810000	Because Nintendo, they have a trend
4810000	4812000	Of following stupid ideas sometimes
4812000	4814000	With the whole Wii Wheel
4814000	4816000	And the Wii Zapper
4816000	4818000	It was just like
4818000	4820000	Hey the Wii Wheel, people buy those stupid
4820000	4822000	Third party wheels because they want to pretend
4822000	4824000	That they have a steering wheel because they can't
4824000	4826000	Use their imagination
4826000	4828000	Let's put one out too
4828000	4830000	Hey, they can't imagine that it's a gun
4830000	4832000	It would look like a gun
4832000	4834000	What are we going to have with the fucking boxing gloves or something?
4834000	4836000	I mean seriously
4836000	4838000	There's going to be some really retarded stuff
4838000	4840000	Coming out I'm sure
4840000	4842000	There'll be storage dammit! I want my storage
4842000	4844000	You know what this show
4844000	4846000	Needs you guys
4846000	4848000	Before we wrap it up and take some calls
4848000	4850000	And get out of here for the night
4850000	4852000	You know what this show needs? More Journey
4852000	4854000	That's right
4854000	4856000	We have some Journey news for you guys tonight
4856000	4858000	But it's kind of
4858000	4860000	Kind of a little bit saddening
4860000	4862000	About this particular Journey news
4862000	4864000	Actually apparently
4864000	4866000	Steve Perry who used to be the front man
4866000	4868000	For Journey
4868000	4870000	He did an interview this week with GQ
4870000	4872000	Magazine and you can actually read it online
4872000	4874000	At men.style.com
4874000	4876000	And he actually talked about
4876000	4878000	The Journey arcade game
4878000	4880000	And if you've never played the arcade game
4880000	4882000	Run, do not walk
4882000	4884000	To Mame and check this out
4884000	4886000	Yes it's a cheesy game but
4886000	4888000	For it's time period it was awesome
4888000	4890000	Because the actual cabinet
4890000	4892000	Would play the song separate ways
4892000	4894000	On tape
4894000	4896000	When you beat the game you were at a Journey concert
4896000	4898000	And separate ways would play on tape and it was awesome
4898000	4900000	And then the aliens would kidnap all their instruments again
4900000	4902000	However Steve Perry
4902000	4904000	Says oh no no no
4904000	4906000	I never thought we should have done the game
4906000	4908000	He's being your typical rock snob
4908000	4910000	He says everybody went against me on that issue
4910000	4912000	Because I thought it was silly
4912000	4914000	I've come to find out there's a generation of kids
4914000	4916000	Who think it's classic and wish they could find the arcade version
4916000	4918000	But I personally thought it was kind of dumb
4918000	4920000	Hmph
4920000	4922000	And then you get this
4922000	4924000	As if the ego wasn't big enough
4924000	4926000	See it's funny because I thought that we were big already
4926000	4928000	That we didn't need a video game
4928000	4930000	But that's just how the world judges you
4930000	4932000	Like gee whiz you have a Lamborghini so you must be big
4932000	4934000	I didn't understand that
4934000	4936000	Whatever
4936000	4938000	Like seriously go watch some of your own 80's music videos
4938000	4940000	And yeah then come back to me
4940000	4942000	Come back to me and talk
4942000	4944000	I still love Journey though
4944000	4946000	And I still love Steve Perry even if he's a rock snob
4946000	4948000	Who kind of said a dumpy thing this week
4948000	4950000	Journey's still awesome
4950000	4952000	Don't let anybody tell you different
4952000	4954000	Right Dark Sakura?
4954000	4956000	Right!
4956000	4958000	And and and and
4958000	4960000	And the ferret
4960000	4962000	Alright
4962000	4964000	Before we close out the show tonight
4964000	4966000	We have to get some calls
4966000	4968000	We have to pay respect to our elders this week
4968000	4970000	By revisiting the classics
4970000	4972000	And we have for you guys
4972000	4974000	If Jamie doesn't drop her microphone much more
4974000	4976000	We have for you a trip down memory lane
4976000	4978000	With this the classic game of the week
4978000	4980000	And apparently
4980000	4982000	Dark Sakura's opting for
4982000	4984000	Like a classic of classics
4984000	4986000	Like a just freaking like
4986000	4988000	I don't want to say obvious choice
4988000	4990000	But just a choice
4990000	4992000	That had to be here eventually
4992000	4994000	Had to
4994000	4996000	Right? Absolutely
4996000	4998000	So what did you pick for the kids tonight?
4998000	5000000	Chrono Trigger
5000000	5002000	Of course
5002000	5004000	Also it's because Sauce suggested it too
5004000	5006000	Oh I was going to speculate maybe it was tied into the recent
5006000	5008000	Announcement of the DS conversion
5008000	5010000	That's part of it too
5010000	5012000	I had to play like the best music in the game
5012000	5014000	This is like my favorite music in the game
5014000	5016000	My second favorite music in the game
5016000	5018000	Let's hear a little louder what is this?
5018000	5020000	It's the old palace music
5020000	5022000	Awesome
5022000	5024000	Alright go ahead
5024000	5026000	Anyway it was
5026000	5028000	A role play game that came out on the
5028000	5030000	Super Nintendo
5030000	5032000	Super Famicom
5032000	5034000	It was released in Japan on March 11th 1995
5034000	5036000	And August 22nd 1995
5036000	5038000	In North America
5038000	5040000	It actually has
5040000	5042000	I think it's great they mention this
5042000	5044000	Square's dream team
5044000	5046000	Was behind it which was
5046000	5048000	Hironobu Sakaguchi
5048000	5050000	And
5050000	5052000	Nobuo Uematsu
5052000	5054000	Also
5054000	5056000	The main artist behind the characters
5056000	5058000	Was Akira Toyama
5058000	5060000	Who did the Dragon Quest series
5060000	5062000	And we better know for Dragon Ball
5062000	5064000	And Dr. Slump
5064000	5066000	Now remember
5066000	5068000	Water summons wind and wind makes fire dance
5072000	5074000	And
5074000	5076000	So
5076000	5078000	A lot of the musical score
5078000	5080000	Was done by Yasunori Mitsuda
5080000	5082000	Who
5082000	5084000	Actually passed on his duties
5084000	5086000	To Uematsu when he fell ill
5086000	5088000	So
5088000	5090000	But a lot of the way
5090000	5092000	That this game played
5092000	5094000	Is that
5094000	5096000	It was sort of an action
5096000	5098000	Slash sort of turn based RPG
5098000	5100000	You could totally avoid some of the battles
5100000	5102000	Because you'd see the enemies hanging out
5102000	5104000	But if you wanted to
5104000	5106000	Go into the battle you'd like
5106000	5108000	You would run up to the creatures they would spot you
5108000	5110000	And then your battle sequence would start
5110000	5112000	And the style is actually sort of
5112000	5114000	Reminds me of later on in the Evolution series
5114000	5116000	Did you ever play that?
5116000	5118000	Evolution and Grandia?
5118000	5120000	Not really I think I've seen it but not really played it
5120000	5122000	I've seen some of the elements came in
5122000	5124000	But it was also very much though
5124000	5126000	The Secret of Mana incorporated some of the same stuff too
5126000	5128000	Where
5128000	5130000	You would see your enemies instead of having
5130000	5132000	Just a random
5132000	5134000	You know, encounter
5134000	5136000	And you would have
5136000	5138000	Everyone had hit points, they would have magical weaknesses
5138000	5140000	But the really cool thing about this
5140000	5142000	And this is actually called
5142000	5144000	The Active Time Battle System
5144000	5146000	Which
5146000	5148000	Actually was designed
5148000	5150000	For Final Fantasy 4
5150000	5152000	Which we had up here is 2
5152000	5154000	Where you have a personal timer
5154000	5156000	That's based on
5156000	5158000	Your character speed statistic
5158000	5160000	And you also get text
5160000	5162000	This is your magic attack but the good thing about them
5162000	5164000	Is that you could
5164000	5166000	Combine your text with other people
5166000	5168000	Once you
5168000	5170000	Use them enough and
5170000	5172000	You would have like for example the
5172000	5174000	Antipode attack so it was the fire and ice attack
5174000	5176000	Remember that?
5176000	5178000	And you get different levels of those
5178000	5180000	Or the
5180000	5182000	I just remember Frog's giant bouncing frog
5182000	5184000	That was awesome
5184000	5186000	That's actually in this clip too
5186000	5188000	Later on
5188000	5190000	Dude this person
5190000	5192000	Played through the entire freaking game and it's all on YouTube
5192000	5194000	Like 120 some odd parts
5194000	5196000	It's huge
5196000	5198000	Like 15 minutes a piece
5198000	5200000	Ultimaga weapon
5200000	5202000	Well the other
5202000	5204000	The other really neat
5204000	5206000	Like another example by the way
5206000	5208000	It was combining Chrono Cyclone Tech with Lucas
5208000	5210000	Flame Toss to create Flame World
5210000	5212000	As their attack
5212000	5214000	Also the other cool thing
5214000	5216000	Is because you would guess by
5216000	5218000	Using Chrono in the title that it has to do with time
5218000	5220000	It did have time travel
5220000	5222000	You could go to the same place
5222000	5224000	In time
5224000	5226000	And for a while you'd only have like certain
5226000	5228000	Ways that you could do it
5228000	5230000	But as you progressed you eventually got a ship
5230000	5232000	That would let you go through time
5232000	5234000	And you would do
5234000	5236000	Different things through different parts
5236000	5238000	Of the game and the best thing about it was
5238000	5240000	New Game Plus
5240000	5242000	Where you would start your game
5242000	5244000	Over with everything intact
5244000	5246000	Except for
5246000	5248000	The special equipment
5248000	5250000	That were part of the storyline to find
5250000	5252000	Like the Masamune
5252000	5254000	The characters in it
5254000	5256000	You had Chrono who was like your main guy
5256000	5258000	And his was the
5258000	5260000	The lightning based attack
5260000	5262000	I do believe
5262000	5264000	And then you had
5264000	5266000	Luca, you had Marle
5268000	5270000	You also had a bonus character
5270000	5272000	Which was Magus
5272000	5274000	But you can either
5274000	5276000	Keep him or let him go depending on whatever you said to him
5276000	5278000	You also had
5278000	5280000	A bajillion different endings in this
5280000	5282000	And to refer to the
5282000	5284000	The actual
5288000	5290000	Super Nintendo version, sorry
5290000	5292000	You actually do believe that you had
5292000	5294000	Fourteen endings I want to say
5294000	5296000	So it was actually
5296000	5298000	Fairly sweet
5298000	5300000	Including one where you get to hang with the developers
5300000	5302000	Which is kind of cool
5302000	5304000	That one was my favorite just because
5304000	5306000	Sorry about that high pitch noise, that's the game they're transporting right now
5308000	5310000	But um
5310000	5312000	It was just
5312000	5314000	The game was epic
5314000	5316000	And there was a Playstation release
5316000	5318000	That had I do believe
5318000	5320000	An extra dungeon in it
5320000	5322000	And also another ending
5322000	5324000	Plus it had animated cut scenes
5324000	5326000	In it
5326000	5328000	As far as the
5328000	5330000	Original release
5330000	5332000	It actually did have
5336000	5338000	Some pretty interesting
5340000	5342000	I guess innovations to the cartridge itself
5344000	5346000	There was however a bit of controversy
5346000	5348000	That an
5348000	5350000	Unfinished version of the game
5350000	5352000	Had a ROM linked up
5352000	5354000	On the internet
5354000	5356000	Back in 95
5356000	5358000	That had
5358000	5360000	Music that was not used in the game
5360000	5362000	And a dungeon called the singing mountain
5362000	5364000	And another
5364000	5366000	Character that
5366000	5368000	There were other sprites for characters
5368000	5370000	That never were used
5370000	5372000	I wonder if we'll see that in the DS
5372000	5374000	Well um
5374000	5376000	I do want to say that I think
5376000	5378000	That level
5378000	5380000	Was used eventually
5380000	5382000	But I never played the Playstation version
5382000	5384000	So I'm not, don't quote me on that one
5384000	5386000	And also Chrono Cross was
5386000	5388000	A true sequel to it
5388000	5390000	In one of the
5390000	5392000	Anime cut scenes
5392000	5394000	That was for Chrono Cross
5394000	5396000	It led up to Luca
5396000	5398000	Finding a kid for
5398000	5400000	Sorry for Chrono Trigger, it led up to Luca
5400000	5402000	Finding a kid for Chrono Cross
5402000	5404000	It was sort of interesting
5404000	5406000	It's rumored also
5406000	5408000	That Chrono Trigger is supposed to be coming
5408000	5410000	On to
5410000	5412000	Virtual console
5412000	5414000	There is going to be a DC
5414000	5416000	DS sorry, DS release
5416000	5418000	Which in my opinion
5418000	5420000	Means the Virtual Console 1 won't happen
5420000	5422000	Why would they only make $15 off the Virtual Console 1
5422000	5424000	When they can charge $35.40 for the DS 1
5424000	5426000	Unless they're going to innovate something
5426000	5428000	But it looks so far
5428000	5430000	The trailer is actually up at ChronoTrigger.jp
5430000	5432000	Or.co.jp
5432000	5434000	So you can see it looks just the same
5434000	5436000	But there was another
5436000	5438000	Project that I don't know if you had ever heard of
5438000	5440000	Called Chrono Resurrection
5440000	5442000	I think we covered it on the show a while ago
5442000	5444000	But yeah, it looked awesome
5444000	5446000	And basically they were
5446000	5448000	Redoing the whole thing in 3D
5448000	5450000	And Squenix did release
5450000	5452000	Cease and Desist
5452000	5454000	There are supposed to be ROM hacks
5454000	5456000	Out there
5458000	5460000	But
5460000	5462000	As to where you can find them
5462000	5464000	If someone can find them, let me know
5464000	5466000	There's also plenty of good music
5466000	5468000	There's actually
5468000	5470000	An acid jazz
5470000	5472000	Soundtrack release called Frank of Time
5472000	5474000	It's actually really good at listening to music
5474000	5476000	There's also
5476000	5478000	Play Concerts had some
5478000	5480000	Chrono Trigger music in it
5480000	5482000	And of course there's the regular soundtrack
5482000	5484000	And of course you can find
5484000	5486000	There's an album called
5486000	5488000	Time and Space, a tribute to
5488000	5490000	Yasunori Mitsuda
5490000	5492000	And Chrono Symphonic
5492000	5494000	Which was released by Overclock
5494000	5496000	Wow
5496000	5498000	Lots of stuff on Chrono Trigger
5498000	5500000	Lots of fan art
5500000	5502000	I had a thought, you know how the rumor was going around
5502000	5504000	That the Final Fantasy 11 folks are
5504000	5506000	Supposed to be working on a new MMO
5506000	5508000	That's not Final Fantasy, what if it was
5508000	5510000	Some type of Chrono Online
5510000	5512000	RPG, I bet it would work
5512000	5514000	The Satellaview had a release
5514000	5516000	A spin-off game
5516000	5518000	Called Chrono Trigger Jet Bike
5518000	5520000	Special, which is a mini-game
5520000	5522000	The whole racing scene that I hated
5522000	5524000	In Chrono Trigger
5524000	5526000	There was also
5526000	5528000	A 16 minute OAV
5528000	5530000	It was called
5530000	5532000	Numa no Monja
5532000	5534000	Time and Space Adventures
5534000	5536000	Which was
5536000	5538000	I actually downloaded it today
5538000	5540000	But I watched it all on YouTube earlier
5540000	5542000	It's very silly, but it's got
5542000	5544000	Some funny stuff in it
5544000	5546000	It's actually pretty cute
5546000	5548000	Radical Dreamers
5548000	5550000	Was
5550000	5552000	Like a
5552000	5554000	Scenario version
5554000	5556000	That was a side story to Chrono Trigger
5556000	5558000	That came out on Satellaview on X-96
5558000	5560000	So
5560000	5562000	There you go
5562000	5564000	Alright, your classic game of the week
5564000	5566000	Been a long time coming
5566000	5568000	Chrono Trigger
5568000	5570000	For the Super Nintendo and soon to be a bunch of others
5570000	5572000	PlayStation I guess you could say
5572000	5574000	And soon to be the DS
5574000	5576000	Who knows, maybe someday if people get what they want
5576000	5578000	Virtual Console, there you have it
5578000	5580000	Alright, now we are going to go
5580000	5582000	And take your calls on the Skype line
5582000	5584000	At 1877
5584000	5586000	Game OLR, username on Skype
5586000	5588000	However, quickly
5588000	5590000	Before we take calls, I want to say tonight
5590000	5592000	We really want to hear your predictions
5592000	5594000	For E3
5594000	5596000	Especially like Wild One, don't name things that have already been
5596000	5598000	Somewhat confirmed, but what are your
5598000	5600000	Kind of predictions for E3 tonight
5600000	5602000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
5602000	5604000	It's the one and only Ravenstaufen
5604000	5606000	Well, hello one and only Ravenstaufen
5606000	5608000	How you doing?
5608000	5610000	Are you heading out to PAX to represent Deadpix Alive?
5610000	5612000	Loserly will
5612000	5614000	Oh, not you, well that's too bad
5614000	5616000	But ok, at least you got some representation
5616000	5618000	Hey, we're asking everybody tonight
5618000	5620000	What are your predictions for E3 this year?
5620000	5622000	What do you think is going to happen?
5622000	5624000	I think Reggie is going to come out and just announce something insane
5624000	5626000	He's just going to pull down his pants and say
5626000	5628000	Here it is
5628000	5630000	I don't know about that
5630000	5632000	I think there might be
5632000	5634000	Laws against him doing that in public
5634000	5636000	No really, anything game related
5636000	5638000	That maybe hasn't been touched on
5638000	5640000	That you think we'll see at E3?
5640000	5642000	Or that you want to see?
5642000	5644000	You know what, I'm probably going to be the only one
5644000	5646000	Here, and I'm
5646000	5648000	Going to predict Wii Fit 2
5648000	5650000	Wii Fit 2, this early
5650000	5652000	Really, I would think if we're going to get Wii Fit 2
5652000	5654000	We'd hear about next E3, but that's just me
5656000	5658000	Or some expansion of Wii Fit
5658000	5660000	Because it's good, don't get me wrong
5660000	5662000	It's really good, but it's slim
5662000	5664000	So they need to put something out now
5664000	5666000	What do you think though
5666000	5668000	If Animal Crossing and Punch-Out
5668000	5670000	Are their big flagship games for the Christmas season?
5670000	5672000	Dude, Punch-Out
5672000	5674000	Punch-Out with the
5674000	5676000	Balance Board would be hot
5676000	5678000	It would be kind of fun
5678000	5680000	It would be nice
5680000	5682000	BlackWolf says they're going to announce when they actually put more Wii Fit
5682000	5684000	On shelves, I still can't find one
5684000	5686000	Me neither, I tried to look for it when I bought
5686000	5688000	Civ Rev Lucian and they didn't have it
5688000	5690000	I lost 20 pounds
5690000	5692000	On Wii Fit
5692000	5694000	Really?
5694000	5696000	See, ever since my pancreas issues, I've lost 30 pounds
5696000	5698000	And I'm just thinking, God, how much more could I lose
5698000	5700000	If Wii Fit got in the picture, you know?
5700000	5702000	Crazy
5702000	5704000	Anything else, any other predictions for E3 this year?
5704000	5706000	Not really
5706000	5708000	Just that
5708000	5710000	Just mostly, Sony's going to probably announce
5710000	5712000	Probably an internet browser
5712000	5714000	For the, I mean
5714000	5716000	A radio
5716000	5718000	A radio for the PS3, because that would be nice
5718000	5720000	That would be nice, more listeners for us
5720000	5722000	I am all for these independent
5722000	5724000	Applications and ways to get the
5724000	5726000	Independent radio out there
5726000	5728000	Down with corporate radio, boo
5728000	5730000	One more thing
5730000	5732000	I did get the iPhone 3G
5732000	5734000	And it's nice and fast
5734000	5736000	Dark Soccer, you should get
5736000	5738000	Shazam for your iPhone
5738000	5740000	What's Shazam?
5740000	5742000	Does it have anything to do with Captain Marvel?
5742000	5744000	It does nothing to do with Captain Marvel
5744000	5746000	Basically, it listens to
5746000	5748000	Say you're listening to a song
5748000	5750000	And you have no idea what it is
5750000	5752000	And the iPhone will listen to that song
5752000	5754000	And tell you what it is
5754000	5756000	That's kind of cool, that's like some of those Verizon phones
5756000	5758000	Yeah, I've heard about the Verizon thing, that's kind of neat
5758000	5760000	I've got a real obscure song that I need a title to
5760000	5762000	So, I may have to hit that up
5762000	5764000	Wait, wait, wait
5764000	5766000	You may have a usefulness for an Apple product?
5766000	5768000	Well, I've tried those other services
5768000	5770000	That listen to the song
5770000	5772000	And they can't figure it out
5772000	5774000	Interesting, I bet you
5774000	5776000	It probably only works with well known songs
5776000	5778000	This is obscure enough, but we'll see, you never know
5778000	5780000	That's why there's this radio station
5780000	5782000	The one radio station I will listen to
5782000	5784000	In town, is completely DJ free
5784000	5786000	And it plays the music I like
5786000	5788000	Which is like 90's, 80's and
5788000	5790000	Today music, but it's all kind of alternative-y
5790000	5792000	But at the end of every song
5792000	5794000	They say the name and the artist
5794000	5796000	There's no DJ's on the network, but there's this little robotic
5796000	5798000	Voice that will say, for instance,
5798000	5800000	Today I heard Duran, Duran
5800000	5802000	The Reflex, which is awesome
5802000	5804000	The Reflex
5804000	5806000	It's an awesome radio station, I gotta say
5806000	5808000	Which is funny because it used to be the dentist office music station
5808000	5810000	But now it's pretty awesome
5810000	5812000	Anyway, any other quick thoughts? We gotta go
5812000	5814000	Yeah, one more thing
5814000	5816000	One more thing, last thing
5816000	5818000	The remote for the iPhone
5818000	5820000	To control your iTunes is great
5820000	5822000	That one is my favorite app
5822000	5824000	I like the application called Flashlight
5824000	5826000	Because I imagine you push a button
5826000	5828000	And it just turns your screen white
5828000	5830000	Flashlight
5830000	5832000	It sure is, and I haven't tried that yet
5832000	5834000	iPhone is a flashlight, you can use that
5834000	5836000	How about an OLR app?
5836000	5838000	We need an OLR app on iPhone stat
5838000	5840000	Are you working on it?
5840000	5842000	You are not working on it
5842000	5844000	Someone work on it for us, and bring our text-based game to
5844000	5846000	To iPhone, we need
5846000	5848000	iPhone Zork
5848000	5850000	Alright, we gotta let you go, we want more predictions
5850000	5852000	Take care, buddy
5852000	5854000	Good luck with Dead Pigs Alive
5854000	5856000	Hi, you're on Orange Line Radio, who's this?
5856000	5858000	Hey, hey, it's Ronneman from New York
5858000	5860000	You have been on the show too damn much recently
5860000	5862000	How was the flight back, good?
5862000	5866000	Yeah, there was a slight issue getting back
5866000	5868000	But we'll save that for another time
5868000	5870000	Alright, fair enough. Hey, what are your predictions for E3?
5870000	5872000	I believe I told you that last week
5872000	5874000	And I'll say it again
5874000	5876000	Reggie Fils-May will come out on stage
5876000	5878000	And not just cockslap everyone
5878000	5880000	With his Wii as Raven Dolphin said
5880000	5882000	He will announce Star Fox
5882000	5884000	With twin sticks using the
5884000	5886000	Wiimote and nunchuck
5886000	5888000	I could go for that
5888000	5890000	There hasn't been any Star Fox
5890000	5892000	Lovin' on the Wii, I could go for that
5892000	5894000	That's a realistic prediction
5894000	5896000	Hell yes
5896000	5898000	Anything else? What about the other systems
5898000	5900000	You Nintendo fanboy? What about Xbox and
5900000	5902000	Sony World?
5902000	5904000	Since they're doing this 60 gig thing
5904000	5906000	I see them coming out saying
5906000	5908000	To everybody who bought a 360
5908000	5910000	In the past three months is getting a $50
5910000	5912000	Rebate check and they're going to
5912000	5914000	Announce 60 gig hard drives
5914000	5916000	For pickup because I'm running out of
5916000	5918000	Space in my 360
5918000	5920000	I doubt you on that one
5920000	5922000	I think that goes with one of those early adopters technology
5922000	5924000	You just get screwed
5924000	5926000	You know what though, I still have the 20 gig and I'm doing fine
5926000	5928000	But I don't download movies or any of that stuff
5928000	5930000	And I don't rip a lot of music
5930000	5932000	And I uninstalled Final Fantasy XI
5932000	5934000	So I have most of my space, you know?
5934000	5936000	We have Guitar Hero and Rock Band
5936000	5938000	In the house, so yeah
5938000	5940000	One of those two, I don't download everything
5940000	5942000	But I download enough
5942000	5944000	I will say though it is getting full
5944000	5946000	But I've been just deleting arcade trials
5946000	5948000	That I don't really use and I'm
5948000	5950000	I usually got enough room
5950000	5952000	But at least it's got a
5952000	5954000	Decent amount of space unlike a
5954000	5956000	Certain other system which won't be named
5956000	5958000	Which would be my prediction
5958000	5960000	If you ask me my prediction for E3
5960000	5962000	I do think
5962000	5964000	Our friends, Reggie Fils-May
5964000	5966000	Is going to come out and address that issue and make that other guy
5966000	5968000	From Europe look like the jackass he is
5968000	5970000	I hope, I hope
5970000	5972000	That's please plausible, I actually believe
5972000	5974000	That one more
6002000	6004000	The next conference will be on Xbox.com
6004000	6006000	And it will probably be on Microsoft's site
6006000	6008000	They normally feed those
6008000	6010000	I want to say if I remember right
6010000	6012000	And I apologize if I misappropriating this
6012000	6014000	Because I'm going to be talking about someone else's show
6014000	6016000	But I watch Twitter and I follow other podcasters on Twitter
6016000	6018000	I want to say Gamertag Radio
6018000	6020000	Is running the Xbox conference
6020000	6022000	Of course, because you know, Gamertag, hello
6022000	6024000	But I think they're running the Nintendo one too
6024000	6026000	On their site, so check it
6026000	6028000	Awesome, I might definitely do that
6028000	6030000	Yep, alright
6030000	6032000	We got to get more prediction calls, okay
6032000	6034000	Cool, no problem, later guys
6034000	6036000	Bye Jamie
6036000	6038000	What, no bye for Matt?
6038000	6040000	Whatever
6040000	6042000	I love you Loki, you alright man
6042000	6044000	Alright, take care
6044000	6046000	That was pretty good, I got to say
6046000	6048000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
6048000	6050000	Hi
6050000	6052000	Hey, you're dropping out there a little bit bud
6052000	6054000	Make sure you got everything else shut off
6054000	6056000	On your internets
6056000	6058000	That's alright
6058000	6060000	Alright, give it a try, quickly
6060000	6062000	What are your predictions for this year's E3?
6062000	6064000	Identify yourself too, who are you?
6064000	6066000	Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to say Gold Banjo
6066000	6068000	Well hello Gold Banjo, what are your predictions for E3 this year?
6068000	6070000	Okay
6070000	6074000	Well, I'm hoping for maybe an F0 Wii
6074000	6076000	But I don't know if it'll happen
6076000	6078000	That is a mighty fine prediction
6078000	6080000	And it may be a little bit fanboyish
6080000	6082000	But I'm with you on that
6082000	6086000	Because I still will play F0 on the GameCube
6086000	6088000	F0 GX, I love F0
6088000	6092000	Like, that is one of my favorite racing series, I love it
6092000	6094000	And GS68
6094000	6098000	And what Rama said, I guess I'm hoping for that too
6098000	6100000	All the predictions so far are pretty good
6100000	6102000	I don't know how many of them we'll see
6102000	6104000	But I'm excited about it
6104000	6106000	GS68 in chat says F0 is a dead series
6106000	6108000	I hope to hell you're wrong
6108000	6110000	I hope you're wrong, because I don't know about you Loki
6110000	6112000	Aren't you a big F0 fan too?
6112000	6114000	I was only the last one, it was alright
6114000	6118000	The problem with the arcade one, the only problem I had with the arcade one was the fact that
6118000	6120000	It only had four tracks
6120000	6124000	But my god, the GameCube and the way it linked together was awesome
6124000	6126000	And just, oh man, I just
6126000	6128000	Only problem was finding an arcade cabinet
6128000	6130000	Is what?
6130000	6132000	Finding an arcade cabinet
6132000	6134000	Yeah, yeah, true true
6134000	6136000	Well, any other quick predictions?
6136000	6138000	A lot of our callers are jumping right to Nintendo
6138000	6140000	What about Microsoft and Sony camps?
6140000	6142000	Anything you got there?
6142000	6146000	Um, I don't have a PS3 or a 360
6146000	6148000	So who cares? Fuck them, right?
6148000	6152000	Yeah, one more thing about the F0 thing
6152000	6154000	Sure sure
6154000	6156000	On the F0, you know the F0 expansion pack, right?
6156000	6158000	For that cancelled add-on for the N64
6158000	6160000	Oh right, huh?
6160000	6164000	They had a car and track editor
6164000	6167000	But yet they never added that into GX when it came out
6167000	6170000	Maybe I would hope that they would add that for the Wii
6170000	6174000	And maybe some track and car sharing and stuff
6174000	6176000	That'd be awesome
6176000	6178000	That'd be pretty cool
6178000	6180000	I'm gonna go play some F0 GameCube tonight
6180000	6182000	Oh
6182000	6184000	I got my GameCube controller for Mega Man
6184000	6186000	I got a new memory card for the Mega Man game when I bought it
6186000	6188000	Now I'm itching to play some F0
6188000	6190000	So thanks a lot
6190000	6192000	That's all good
6192000	6194000	Alright, we gotta let you go buddy
6194000	6196000	Take care and happy E3
6196000	6198000	Yep, you too, bye
6198000	6200000	Alright, bye bye
6200000	6202000	If you wanna give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR
6202000	6204000	username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio
6204000	6206000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
6206000	6208000	Hey, this is Akdeft
6208000	6210000	Hey Akdeft, I love your icon on Skype
6210000	6212000	By the way, it's a little Kirby chef
6212000	6214000	It's awesome
6214000	6216000	And it looks like it's eating something
6216000	6218000	Is it inhaling a cupcake? I can't tell
6218000	6220000	It's awesome though
6220000	6222000	What's your predictions for E3, sir?
6222000	6224000	I have two
6224000	6226000	One Nintendo related, another Sony one
6226000	6228000	Let's give it some variety
6228000	6230000	Let's hear your Sony one first
6230000	6232000	Because everyone's done Nintendo right off the bat
6232000	6234000	Okay, my Sony one is
6234000	6236000	Sly Cooper 4 for the Playstation 3
6236000	6238000	Or maybe a PSP game
6238000	6240000	A what for the PS3?
6240000	6242000	Sly Cooper
6242000	6244000	Oh, okay
6244000	6246000	Sly Cooper
6246000	6248000	Cool, okay
6248000	6250000	So some game announcements
6250000	6252000	I definitely hope that it's going to be announced
6252000	6254000	It's a far shot
6254000	6256000	Any reason why you're going for Sly Cooper?
6256000	6258000	Well, definitely
6258000	6260000	Maybe because mainly
6260000	6262000	Excuse me
6262000	6264000	Because I'm a fan of the series
6264000	6266000	So I really hope that this time
6266000	6268000	It's going to be announced
6268000	6270000	No reason you can't have a little fanboyism
6270000	6272000	In your predictions, what about Nintendo?
6272000	6276000	A new Kirby game for the Wii
6276000	6278000	And so your icon's not just a clever icon
6278000	6280000	Yeah, a Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool
6280000	6282000	Although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately
6282000	6284000	A new Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool
6284000	6286000	Although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately
6286000	6288000	Well
6288000	6290000	The Kirby franchise needs a new
6290000	6292000	A definitely new game
6292000	6294000	Like a lift-off
6294000	6296000	That Kirby drawing game
6296000	6298000	On the DS
6298000	6300000	Might be kind of fun on the Wii
6300000	6302000	I actually liked that game quite a bit
6302000	6304000	I don't remember, did it touch All-Stars or something?
6304000	6306000	I liked that game, it was fun
6306000	6308000	Yeah, one of my predictions on the forums
6308000	6310000	For this year was going to be a port
6310000	6312000	With using that same gameplay
6312000	6316000	So I hope that Nintendo announces this on E3
6316000	6318000	Alright, we'll see
6318000	6320000	Akdeft, any other quick last thoughts before we get to some more predictions?
6320000	6326000	No, just thanks on the question for Tomotaro Rico
6326000	6328000	Hey, no problem
6328000	6330000	Hey, this show is not just about the three of us
6330000	6332000	It's about the listeners
6332000	6334000	When we can ask questions that we know our listeners don't want to hear
6334000	6336000	We ask them
6336000	6338000	Alright, take care buddy
6338000	6340000	And I hope it does get back to them, by the way
6340000	6342000	I think this will be our last call
6342000	6344000	Then we're going to call it a night because we're running pretty long
6344000	6346000	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
6346000	6348000	DS68
6348000	6350000	Well hello, you got through
6350000	6352000	What's your predictions for E3, buddy?
6352000	6354000	The employees of Konami and Harmonix duke it out
6354000	6356000	Over the whole Rock Battle lawsuit
6356000	6362000	And it's a myth that an arcade game gets announced at E3 and the whole universe dies
6362000	6366000	So are you suggesting that Konami should bring back their Rumble Roses models
6366000	6368000	From a few E3s ago
6368000	6370000	And they can duke it out in Cream Corn or Jello Wrestling?
6370000	6372000	No, I was joking
6372000	6374000	I wasn't
6374000	6378000	Maybe, like you and some other cars have said
6378000	6382000	Maybe Nintendo will address the storage space
6382000	6384000	To some sort of attachment to the Wii
6384000	6388000	That applies to the USB drive or something
6388000	6390000	Yeah, just a patch that they could release overnight
6390000	6392000	That will let the USB drives work
6392000	6394000	I don't know, call it a hunch
6394000	6399000	Also, freaking Super Mario RPG gets it released on Virtual Console
6399000	6401000	Ah, now there's a good fanboy prediction
6401000	6403000	Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console
6403000	6404000	We know it's coming eventually, right?
6404000	6406000	We heard the Japanese one
6406000	6408000	So you would think if it's coming out in Japan
6408000	6410000	It's got to come out here eventually
6410000	6412000	So we'll see
6412000	6414000	Any other predictions, sir?
6414000	6418000	What about the Sony and Microsoft end of things?
6418000	6424000	Well, I don't really know because
6424000	6427000	The only next-gen console I was at was the Wii
6427000	6431000	I don't feel like I lost somebody for 360 or PS3 at the moment
6431000	6434000	How about, I'll give you a fanboy one
6434000	6436000	Because I would love to see this someday
6436000	6438000	How about a company announces in partnership
6438000	6440000	With either Microsoft or Sony
6440000	6443000	A localized version of Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune
6443000	6445000	For consoles?
6445000	6448000	No, I don't know
6448000	6453000	That game seems like the kind of game that they're playing in arcades
6453000	6456000	The PS3 version of Wangan Midnight sucks balls
6456000	6458000	Well, because it's a different thing
6458000	6460000	It's not related to the actual arcade series
6460000	6462000	That game's based off the arcade series
6462000	6464000	But the problem is though
6464000	6467000	It's a port of a PlayStation 1 game, I think
6467000	6468000	No
6468000	6470000	Well, because it's based on
6470000	6477000	It and the original Wangan Midnight arcade game were based on Tokyo Extreme Racer for the PS2
6477000	6479000	Or Dreamcast
6479000	6481000	So the magic just belongs in the arcades
6481000	6483000	It doesn't need to be brought home
6483000	6485000	Yeah, some things in the arc
6485000	6487000	I mean, that's what the arcade needs
6487000	6490000	More things that you can only experience in the arcade
6490000	6496000	I mean, these days you can just easily port shmups and fighters to the consoles and PCs
6496000	6498000	Fair enough, I'll give you that, sir
6498000	6500000	Alright, we're gonna wrap it up, GS68
6500000	6502000	But thanks for the call, have a good one, okay?
6502000	6503000	You too
6503000	6504000	Alright, later
6504000	6506000	We will see what happens at E3
6506000	6508000	It all starts this week
6508000	6509000	It's gonna be awesome
6509000	6512000	In the meantime though, we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts
6512000	6514000	And wrap up the show tonight
6514000	6516000	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
6516000	6520000	Think for yourself and learn to be offended
6520000	6522000	My final thought is
6522000	6524000	I want a Hot Pocket
6524000	6525000	Loki
6525000	6527000	My final thought is I have a bunch of last minute stories
6527000	6529000	Oh yeah, we never get to last minute stories, I'm sorry
6529000	6531000	Alright, last minute stories then, quickly
6531000	6532000	Okay, real quick
6532000	6535000	Madden soundtrack's coming to Rock Band's download content
6535000	6536000	I guess that's kinda cool
6536000	6538000	Did I leave that off the showroom? My bad
6538000	6539000	Yeah
6539000	6540000	I'm a dummy, alright
6540000	6547000	Oni-chanbara, that game with the chicken lingerie and a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword
6547000	6550000	Is coming to the Wii in the US now
6550000	6552000	Fuck yeah, that's awesome
6552000	6556000	Here's one of my predictions to come out of E3
6556000	6561000	That there's gonna be a software patch for the Wii that will allow you to use the Wii classic controller
6561000	6567000	Or perhaps this brand new trademark patented controller that Nintendo will be putting out
6567000	6570000	To be used with GameCube games
6570000	6572000	Instead of having to actually have a GameCube controller
6572000	6573000	That makes sense
6573000	6579000	Because they now have a new thing that looks like a very blocky version of a GameCube controller
6579000	6580000	That's kind of interesting
6580000	6587000	Lots of rumored Xbox Live Arcade games to be coming out tomorrow through next week
6587000	6593000	Including, there is a game by Bungie that's supposedly gonna debut on Xbox Live Arcade tomorrow
6593000	6600000	There's also a rumor that they're gonna surprise us with Geometry Wars Retro Vault 2
6600000	6603000	That might be the surprise thing tomorrow
6603000	6612000	There are a couple other games that they mentioned as well, including, I don't know where to go here
6612000	6618000	There is some other like crosswords game that's gonna be coming out
6618000	6620000	Which I don't know, that didn't look too exciting at all
6620000	6622000	They did announce that though, that's really happening
6622000	6624000	Yeah, that's really happening
6624000	6631000	And there was also some other game, a shooter game, Shred Nebula
6631000	6633000	That's actually gonna be coming out
6633000	6639000	Dude, I would not want to be crappy crosswords game in the week that Duke Nukem or Geometry Wars 2 or these other rumored things get released
6639000	6640000	Exactly
6640000	6644000	There's one thing I do know
6644000	6650000	There was an article, it was actually this week, about Blazing Lizard
6650000	6653000	I guess they're being represented by Flash Man Studios
6653000	6655000	And you may not know who Blazing Lizard is
6655000	6661000	But they're the ones behind Pirates vs Ninja Dodgeball on Xbox Live Arcade
6661000	6664000	And they have an unannounced title for the Wii
6664000	6667000	I know what that game is by chance
6667000	6670000	And it actually is Pirates vs Ninja Dodgeball
6670000	6672000	It's coming to the Wii now too
6672000	6679000	Let's see, there's a pretty cool little game coming out called I Heart Geeks
6679000	6685000	It's a rude Goldberg puzzle game, kind of like in The Incredible Machine
6685000	6691000	And apparently there's some leaks out of Sony's support site about upcoming titles
6691000	6695000	Including Punisher Warzone for the PS3
6695000	6702000	And Maxim Pinball, Cinnamon Beats, Alien Sports Mini Golf, and Under Fire
6702000	6704000	Kind of interesting
6704000	6706000	There's gonna be a new Wolfenstein game at E3 this year
6706000	6710000	In fact that's already in the new Game Informer magazine
6710000	6712000	So check that out, it's pretty cool
6712000	6719000	And also rumored that Rock Band 2's setlist includes Guns N' Roses
6719000	6725000	And the Chinese Democracy Trek
6725000	6729000	That would be a pretty awesome little surprise
6729000	6731000	That could be very interesting
6731000	6735000	And that's all I really want to talk about right now
6735000	6737000	Alright
6737000	6739000	Oh, I'm sorry, one more thing
6739000	6743000	This is completely random
6743000	6746000	I saw there was this list that was on game trailers
6746000	6749000	It's eight extremely embarrassing E3 moments
6749000	6753000	And the one that they have in the very beginning on here is Jamie Kennedy
6753000	6758000	Remember his Activision little spiel last year was completely embarrassing
6758000	6760000	And he wasn't very funny
6760000	6762000	I actually met Jamie Kennedy this Wednesday
6762000	6764000	I have a picture with him actually
6764000	6765000	It's pretty crappy
6765000	6767000	And I have a new autograph for our autograph wall
6767000	6768000	Hooray
6768000	6770000	He's actually pretty funny in person
6770000	6772000	I need to put the freeze-pop autograph up by the way
6772000	6774000	That Rama got me for my birthday
6774000	6776000	And I'm digging that new freeze-pop album actually
6776000	6777000	It's pretty fun
6777000	6778000	Good times
6778000	6780000	Alright, your final thought, Loki
6780000	6784000	My final thought is I hopefully will finish OLR PSP this week
6784000	6788000	I know my wife is really hating that I'm working on this
6788000	6791000	Did you want to change your final thought, Dark Soccer, since it's been so long?
6791000	6792000	No
6792000	6795000	And I will agree with Game Guru on a last final thought
6795000	6797000	E3 better rock
6797000	6800000	I agree, especially since we're not there to party away
6800000	6804000	Anyhow, meanwhile, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting
6804000	6806000	And supporting Orange Lounge Radio
6806000	6808000	And just all independent radio with your support
6808000	6810000	Remember if you like our show, we do it for free
6810000	6813000	Just tell two people you know about Orange Lounge Radio
6813000	6815000	Spread the word, that's all we ask
6815000	6817000	And slowly but surely we take over the world
6817000	6818000	That's how it works
6818000	6821000	Until next time, we'll be back next week with all of the E3 news
6821000	6826000	And if anything especially strikes us, we may go live mid-week
6826000	6828000	We'll see, well not live, but a tape thing
6828000	6830000	Because we can't invade other all-game show space
6830000	6832000	But maybe something mid-week, we'll see
6832000	6835000	In the meantime, I'm Rob Roberts
6835000	6836000	She's Dark Sakura, he's Loki
