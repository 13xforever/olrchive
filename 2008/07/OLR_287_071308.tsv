14090	24546	Tonight, July 13th, 2008, a major lawsuit happens in the music game world, Mega Man 9 is set to go multi-platform, and we take calls on your predictions for this year's E3.
32409	36490	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36530	42212	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42252	47073	My name is Rob Roberts and join me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47414	47694	Yo.
47934	48554	How you doing, Jamie?
49011	49291	Warm.
49672	50252	Warm, yeah.
50372	56256	It's not quite as horrid, the temperature this week, but we still are combating some issues here in California.
56837	60880	Not just the heat, but the smoke was terrible, like Wednesday or Thursday.
61500	62181	Oh my gosh.
62581	64502	I am making use of consumer reports.
64963	66264	It was like a volcano erupted.
66324	66704	How's that?
67264	73489	To look for air conditioners or another idea I have is an evaporative air cooler.
73857	74597	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
95140	97364	And because I didn't want to comb my hair anymore.
98486	105439	It gets to the point where it's like, okay, I can't do anything with this, so I'm going to have to shave it off.
106667	107868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
130990	137352	The Madness for E3 starts tomorrow, so it kind of defeats the purpose of uploading a show mid-week because everything will be outdated.
137692	140413	We're going to try and have something up on the feed mid-week.
140453	142273	It just depends if we can all get together at once.
143333	143754	We'll see.
143894	144554	Some more to come on that.
144574	152116	But for now, we're only going to have one big show for you guys here, but all the segments you know and love, Classic Game of the Week, Mailbag, all that good stuff, and your calls.
152696	156237	And chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
156497	159178	And tonight, they're talking about Fire.
159818	161298	Actdeft says the show is on fire.
161359	162819	Frisbee says my hair is on fire.
163519	164019	There you have it.
164319	165240	Everybody's on fire.
165600	168641	You're all flaming tonight in chat at Orange Lounge Radio.
169001	170341	I think I've made a decision.
170661	171022	What's that?
171322	172502	What might best suit our needs.
172622	173082	The cooler?
173282	173902	A swamp cooler.
174082	174363	Excellent.
174383	175343	Yeah, it actually might work.
175563	177804	And it's cheaper than a portable air conditioning unit.
178164	178464	All right.
178764	179984	Be more cost effective.
180264	182345	This is economics on Orange Lounge Radio.
183585	184166	Save money.
184326	184926	Use less energy.
184946	185306	All right.
185326	187307	Let's talk about all the money you blew games on this week.
187347	188107	And how was your gaming week?
189122	190043	I played DDR.
190923	191243	Really?
191543	195846	I played the Supernova machine at the movie theater and I wanted to die.
196666	201228	I was wearing my sandals so first of all I didn't have the right shoes and then I tried to do shit that was way too hard.
202709	204010	But at least you got up there and played.
205250	205951	Yeah, sort of.
206731	211333	I know if I play I am way, way out of practice so that's my issue.
211634	213915	Although I want to try a Supernova 2 machine someday.
214591	233419	I dusted off my Super Nintendo cartridge of something that I will be speaking of later in the show Awesome How about now, you are an iPhone user Yes, I did download some iPhone games You got the new 2.0 firmware for your existing iPhone, right?
233599	234660	Yes, I did Okay, gotcha
235448	237931	And let me give the name of the game real quick.
238972	240613	Actually, I haven't played a whole lot of it.
241374	245618	But it's a free game for everyone who has an iPhone or an iPod Touch.
246158	247740	And it's called Aurora Faint.
248861	255287	It basically plays like Bejeweled, but you have a leveling system in it.
255347	256188	So it's pretty cool.
256608	258370	Like Puzzle Quest-ish, kind of?
259611	259831	Yeah.
260351	261793	I also downloaded the Stalker program.
262822	264643	What, pray tell, is the stalker program?
264683	265083	Whirl.
266304	266844	How does that work?
267084	272347	It's like, for everyone who's got it, it keeps track of restaurants and places you like to go so that you know where your friends like to hang out.
273088	273968	That is kind of scary.
274308	275369	What a world we're living in.
275749	280291	What do you think, though, about this whole application thing on the new iPhone?
280372	283773	You know, the fact that people can create their own games and applications and all this stuff.
283853	284634	About damn time.
285322	286203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
305834	309916	Do you think another company will try to... Because I noticed, what is that other phone?
309936	312717	The Instinct is supposed to work a lot like the iPhone.
313317	315138	I can tell you now the LG one is shit.
315538	320701	I look at that and I go, it's not going to really be able to penetrate the marketplace the way that Apple has, I don't think.
321161	322001	That's just my personal thought.
322021	325223	What's going to help Apple is marketing to other providers.
325953	327054	I'll tell you what else is cool.
327094	328895	I was hearing a little bit about it on Bobby's show.
328935	337019	I don't know much about this, but apparently there's some type of program you can get, some app you can get that you can listen to internet radio through that Edge network.
337340	339721	So you can listen to All Games Radio or our show anywhere you go.
339961	346845	People have it hooked up so that if you have one of those systems where you can play your iPod through the car, you could listen to All Games Radio like it's a car.
347305	350667	I almost downloaded it, but I have to move off my photos before I put more apps on there.
351568	355150	The stuff that I downloaded so far, let me grab my phone and take a look real quick.
356003	360743	blah live radio, she's literally opening up the phone
362235	369157	I downloaded AIM, Aurora Faint, Twitterific, Whirl, and Epocrates prescription.
369918	382122	Because Epocrates is actually kind of a cool little program that if you have, say that you find like an unidentified pill and you want to know what it is, then you can enter in the pill's description including serial numbers that are on the pill.
382382	382742	Wow.
382782	385483	And it'll look it up and show you a picture of it so you can compare it.
386103	388384	And you know, if I take this, will I hallucinate?
390370	391471	Bobby spoke up in chat.
391511	394032	He says it's called Tuner is the name of the program you're going to want to check out.
394273	395193	I think I'll download it right now.
395553	395813	Awesome.
395853	396554	It might have a cost.
396594	396974	I'm not sure.
398595	399035	Let's see.
399896	400676	Comments from chat.
401497	404778	Robert M., my iTunes is showing the applications menu in place of games.
405159	407040	I have the iPod 5th generation video though.
407100	407760	Same thing happened to me.
407900	414984	I have Pagel and some of the other games they've released for iPod and they now are applications that run on your iPod.
415044	417986	Sadly, they don't have a lot of them but that's what happened to the old games.
418686	419667	I checked out Tuner and Tuner is $5
437537	438777	4.99 to be specific.
438817	439278	Whatever.
439358	439738	Same thing.
439858	440418	It's $5.
442198	445219	So I'm going to get it after I have money.
445619	445959	All right.
446519	448560	I downloaded a bunch of free shit, though, and it was really cool.
449420	450980	Now I can look up drugs at work.
451160	453161	And AIM, I can use AIM at work.
453461	454401	Free is awesome.
454881	456381	Hells yeah.
456761	457562	Unless it's yours.
458002	459142	Loki, how was your gaming week?
460174	461456	It was full of hamburger.
462417	463998	Oh, because I'm eating a hamburger, that's why.
464279	464659	Of course.
465320	468203	That is not just a hamburger, that is a bacon and cheese I see in there.
468363	469264	Double bacon cheeseburger.
469344	471567	Oh my god, an artery killer right there.
471647	475551	Well, it's because, I don't know, fast food hamburgers are pretty tiny.
476152	478514	So if you get a hamburger, it's like a cracker.
479255	479636	Gotcha.
480076	481358	So this is two crackers and...
482338	483039	I don't know, bacon.
483239	486803	By the way, Jamie, Bobby is recommending Tap Tap Revenge and says it's free.
487083	491348	I saw it and I looked at it, but I don't think I would play it that much.
491368	492809	Free, Jamie, free.
493049	495472	Well, if it's free, then you gotta play it.
495552	496093	Like Yaris.
496393	498015	You gotta try Yaris at least once.
498255	502920	I also, though, am trying to be conservative for space because I really do like to take a lot of useless pictures with my phone.
503704	504224	That she does.
504264	505005	I can attest to that.
505445	507686	We'll go out to Indian Food and she takes pictures of the food.
508086	508306	And my beer.
508326	509927	Takes pictures of his eating, her beer.
510167	510627	Anyway, sorry.
510667	511488	Loki, your gaming week.
511508	511848	That's right.
513028	513909	Grand Theft Auto 4.
514129	515009	That was pretty much it.
515750	516510	I've been busy.
517150	518551	And we'll get into that.
518571	519671	We'll get into that in a little while.
519872	521112	But Grand Theft Auto is still fun.
521152	522093	Still a lot of people playing it.
522113	523413	It's still fun.
523653	525474	Well, we've just been playing the work games.
525714	529336	So we do our four-player deathmatch because the fifth machine is still broken.
529656	531657	What makes the replayability of that game so awesome?
531877	542799	Well, the new thing that we're doing now is we've changed the settings a little bit so that the only blip that shows up on the radar is whoever's in first, and everyone else is invisible.
542959	548080	So you're running around, and then whoever is in the lead, you can find them, but the other players you can't find.
548220	553282	So the person in the lead doesn't see people bearing down on them in cars and stuff like that.
553662	554722	So it makes it really...
555582	559104	Really intense, actually, because everyone's kind of going after the leader at the same time.
559545	559765	Nice.
560846	561986	Comments from chat room.
562066	565408	We have Naaman Lights says, I'm using Tuner on iTouch.
566209	572433	So that's that iPod that's not quite, it's the iPhone without the phone, the iTouch, which also got the upgrade to use all the apps.
572773	573393	That's pretty cool.
574394	575635	Let's see, other comments from chat.
576295	580318	Shaoran said, there used to be a double bacon with a really long name that a friend of mine called a Satan Burger.
582014	582354	I don't know.
582374	583735	We're turning into Orange Lounge video.
584155	586256	Alright, so Grantheth out of four was Loki's game of the week.
586276	586996	Yeah, pretty much.
587016	588077	We'll get to the rest of it in a little bit.
589097	591858	Myself, I also have not been playing a lot of new stuff.
591898	592919	Kind of the same old stuff.
592939	594240	You know, Raiding and WoW.
594620	595400	Guitar Hero 2.
595780	597861	I went back and played Guitar Hero 2 this week and Guitar Hero 3.
598421	600542	And I think I talked about this a couple weeks ago.
600562	605485	I'm finally learning with my fingers how to hit those notes without necessarily strumming.
605565	608566	Like the difference between the notes that you don't have to strum if you get the note before it.
608866	610547	I can't remember what exactly they called that.
610587	613107	I'm sure somebody in chat will correct me, but the whole... Hammer-ons?
613127	613948	Is that a hammer-ons?
613988	615188	Yeah, I'm finally learning how to do that better.
615208	615748	I don't know that either.
615768	617889	I mean, hell, I'm still playing three keys, okay?
618589	620230	Well, I was able to go back to Guitar Hero 2 and 3.
621010	623431	I actually beat the Living Color song in Guitar Hero 3.
623651	626432	I five-started my first... Cult of Personality, right?
626492	628192	I five-started my first time on Hard.
628272	628712	Not Expert.
628732	631573	I'm not quite there yet, but for me, that was a freaking accomplishment.
631593	633534	I was so excited, because that song was not easy.
634254	636335	I was excited when I beat that freaking...
638036	638877	Slipknot Song
653985	663094	Just because, I mean, you know, the whole curving bullets thing in there, the way they kind of like swing their gun out or whatever to curve the bullet, you could totally do that with like a Wii Remote or something.
663374	670181	I mean, you could, it, I don't understand why anyone hasn't come up with this idea, like, to make this movie into a game, because it would be pretty awesome.
671121	673383	But the Matrix was supposed to be an awesome game too.
673423	674104	Listen, okay.
675025	678608	After watching this movie, you're just like, why the fuck did this guy not direct the Matrix?
678628	682131	Because I swear to God, if he directed the sequels, we wouldn't have an issue.
682151	684113	There'd be like 50 sequels to this damn movie.
684634	686335	Because it's seriously so much better.
686716	688638	It's the Russian guy who did Nightwatch and Daywatch.
688658	688938	I know.
689058	691961	I used to hold the Matrix pretty high up there for actions.
692721	694043	It's borderline.
694063	695864	Keanu Reeves kind of brings it down there, but...
696892	701233	Action-wise, it was pretty kick-ass, but oh my god, the wanted is so much better.
701533	704794	Sub-Z in chat says, curved bullet is so unrealistic.
704974	706394	It is, that's the point.
706414	712575	You don't go in there expecting a realistic espionage film, right?
713196	720757	Basically, these assassins or whatever have the ability to control adrenaline really well to the point where they can do superhuman things.
720797	722177	That's the whole premise of this.
722998	724598	It's a superhero film, right?
724958	725399	Sort of.
726080	734191	It's not really that superhuman, but like Matrix stuff, where they can slow down time, their perspective of it, super strength and stuff like that.
734231	737295	Here's my other quick questions about Wanted, and then we'll go back to games from movies.
737816	739057	Are there tits in the movie?
739778	739979	No.
740379	741000	No tits? !
741900	742400	No tits.
742760	743641	Any drug usage?
743961	745722	There's lots of blood, lots of killing.
745742	748503	So it's just fine, because I'm looking for the trifecta of sex, drugs, and violence.
748543	750064	There's no tits, so you don't have sex.
750324	751285	There's no drugs, it sounds like?
751305	752786	There's a good twist in the plot.
753126	754887	A good twist that you don't see coming.
755147	755687	It's a twist.
756328	756868	What a twist.
756908	759009	You can have Nookie without boobs, Rob.
760368	760548	TNA-T
778328	779849	Just A. Alright.
780110	794923	And yeah, it's supposed to be unrealistic, but it's not... It's basically... It's kind of like The Matrix, where it's sort of grounded in... Okay, I want to say it's really grounded in the real world, but it takes place in a world that could sort of be realistic, and then there's people doing unrealistic things in it.
795443	799367	It's sort of like that, but it's not as ridiculous and ridiculous as...
799927	800627	Thanks for watching!
817588	817969	DarkSakura.com
834389	835310	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
855229	858410	to get a total domination victory over my opponents in the game.
859830	868312	The only kind of little bitch I have in the game that I think would get to me if I was coming from the PC to the console, and I think you've probably heard this a lot of other places and it's true, you don't get to customize your game a lot.
868652	874074	Like in Civ IV, you can customize the world you're playing on and when you start and how the world looks and the size.
874414	875754	You can customize all that stuff in advance.
876194	879975	In Civ Revolution, you already kind of start with one city built and that's it.
880035	881376	You don't get to customize a whole lot of that.
881796	881936	So...
882916	889280	I'm hoping though, maybe with some download stuff later on, 2K and Firaxis can remedy that.
889560	894843	But it's a minor bitch in the scope of things, because I think the game is still pretty cool.
895823	897904	I'm a little surprised it's not on the arcade.
897984	902087	There's not a lot that they're doing in this game that requires, I would think, the usage of a DVD.
903007	903627	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
918875	922018	I think it's one of those games where it's never quite the same game twice.
922038	925521	And there's many different ways to accomplish the goal, many different civilizations you can play.
925601	930445	So I do recommend it, especially if you're a fan of it on the PC and you want to kind of check it out.
930465	933267	But just know you're not getting a port of Civ IV.
933327	938832	You're getting a whole new Civ-like game that's dumbed down slightly for consoles.
938872	940353	But sometimes dumbed down can be a good thing.
940613	943135	Yeah, Prowler says in chat there, simplified can be a good thing.
943475	945497	And Rama says in chat, Rob is a Civ fanboy.
945537	946398	Of course he's going to love it.
946658	947118	Well, yeah.
947839	956464	I don't know if I'd say I love it, like I love the original Civilization, I love Civ IV, but I like it a lot so far.
957684	958465	So we'll see about that.
958985	961846	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
961886	969290	Again, just to kind of put it out there, we are only doing a Part A tonight and that has to do with the whole E3 and things being outdated.
969710	970151	However...
971178	971859	I have some good news.
972139	974941	Now, we're not bitter at all about not being able to go to E3.
974981	977102	I mean, no one invited us to the cool kids party.
977563	979704	We're not bitter at all about not being able to go.
979764	980104	It's great.
980685	982486	My work got an invite, but they didn't go.
982766	984387	It's like, oh, we don't want to take it.
984407	984848	Don't want to go.
985508	987450	I haven't been interested in going since they changed it.
988490	990572	Although I hear there's no lines and any of that stuff anymore.
990932	995075	I would just want to go to hang out with the cool kids, but apparently we are not part of that clique.
995515	996316	But the hell with them.
997901	999962	We are starting E3 right now.
1000622	1001643	We're starting E3 right now.
1002063	1010427	E3 begins right now on this very radio show that you are listening to with our very own OLR E3 press conference.
1010647	1011287	And you're all invited.
1019981	1023064	All right, and we have our own E3 surprises in store for you tonight.
1023144	1026187	So the official OLR E3 press conference.
1027008	1028169	Blah, blah, blah.
1028289	1033154	We've had wonderful support from all of our listeners over the past six years of our existence.
1033274	1034315	Blah, blah, blah.
1034675	1038839	Our show is still making no money at all, but it's sure fun to listen to and do.
1039199	1040220	Blah, blah, blah.
1040320	1041522	Okay, let's get to the good stuff.
1042022	1042603	E3 won't have us, then F you!
1064130	1065471	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1080856	1081496	We'll see you next time.
1106761	1108643	Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
1108683	1117271	That's three hours on Friday starting at 4 Pacific, three hours on Saturday starting at 4 Pacific, and two hours on Sunday starting at 4 Pacific as well.
1117511	1121816	The whole thing's gonna be moderated by Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy that precedes us here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1122236	1123317	We will be a part of that.
1123357	1124677	We'll be kind of on and off of there.
1125118	1130660	We might do our own podcast from the site to supplement it, but we'll be live as a part of this on All Games Radio.
1130680	1131381	It's not just us.
1131981	1137044	DMN, your old pal from our network as well as Under Station Live, he's going to be there.
1137464	1138164	Bobby's there.
1138304	1139365	Super happy fun time show.
1139445	1146389	Dead Pixel Live, Electric Sisterhood, Game Addict Hotline, Chatterbox, Evil Avatar, all there, all represented at Penny Arcade Expo.
1146709	1149290	It is the freaking Voltron of independent podcasting.
1149790	1150091	Live.
1150971	1153092	August 29th, 30th, and 31st in Seattle.
1153352	1158093	And if you can't be there in person, you can still listen to The Madness on allgames.com.
1158793	1159514	It's going to be awesome.
1160674	1164495	Bobby would like to clarify it is not in the exhibit hall, but it's still within the convention center.
1165456	1165896	So there it is.
1167056	1170277	And the OLR PAX broadcast will also be podcasted.
1172378	1174718	Bobby will let you know when our segment is that we're going to be on it.
1174838	1177079	It's apparently going to be its own special podcast.
1177339	1179560	So stay tuned to allgames.com for more information on that.
1180757	1181497	Second announcement.
1183658	1185479	You asked for it, you got it.
1185940	1186540	We're going to do it.
1187300	1194564	I know that Part B has been very delayed lately throughout the week in getting pushed to the podcast feed, so we're going to try something new.
1194624	1196345	Don't say that OLR doesn't listen to the listeners.
1196885	1201367	Starting with next week's show, Part A and B will be released as one giant show.
1201487	1204729	Parts A and B combined into one giant show.
1205229	1210252	and we will have something that kind of even runs in between the shows when you're listening to them on the podcast.
1210513	1218138	It will not be the show itself but probably promos for other shows and other fun things that we want to try doing with the podcast.
1218158	1222701	Some of these joke ads and things that we were talking about we're going to kind of start to get our feet wet with that.
1222741	1230366	So starting next week parts A and B combined in one part so you no longer have to wait until like Friday or Saturday to hear the whole thing.
1230706	1234789	You will get to download it Monday at the latest which will be pretty awesome.
1235449	1241414	All right, and the third announcement, and my favorite, is really awesome.
1241934	1245857	Loki, why don't you tell the listeners a little more about this, what you've been working on for the past few weeks.
1246078	1249620	Yes, and unfortunately, I wish I could say that I was done, but I'm not.
1250521	1254905	That's okay, because at E3, you sometimes tease things that aren't coming out until Christmas, and this should be out a lot sooner than that.
1254965	1256606	It's not going to be until Christmas.
1257026	1257967	I definitely hope that.
1258427	1259908	I worked my ass off for the last...
1260649	1263572	The brand new OLR PSP All Games Radio Streamer, which is gonna be...
1279468	1279969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1298690	1303913	And let me reiterate, because I saw the draft of what this looks like, and you're going to be posting screenshots to Orange Ones Radio a little later on, right?
1304373	1304593	Yeah.
1304833	1311076	This is actually, the way it looks in your PSP, it is not something, you don't even have to go to olrpsp.com in your browser.
1311136	1315638	It looks like an application loaded in there, like the other radio station listeners.
1315918	1322321	You click it, it takes you to a live radio feed that is broadcasting all games radio.
1322361	1323922	This is the part that Bobby didn't even know about.
1324282	1329886	It even is taking that little box with the times of the upcoming shows from the website and showing that as part of the player.
1329946	1330607	It is awesome.
1330927	1336511	And then other things are going to be included with that.
1336751	1338872	All the RSS feeds are going to be in there as well.
1338912	1344456	You'll be able to listen to podcasts from all the different shows and stuff.
1344476	1345937	You'll be able to select through that stuff.
1346678	1348979	Details on all the other shows on all games.
1351701	1355342	Yeah, that's... I mean, there's a lot of small things I'm working on right now, unfortunately.
1355803	1369467	And, um... Yeah, IRC chat on the PSP, I tried... I even tried buying the PSP IRC script, and the guy is a douchebag and won't fucking sell it, even for a lot of money, but, uh... I think you're supposed to say douchebag in an E3 press conference.
1369508	1370528	That's alright, that's alright.
1370708	1372669	Breaking new ground here, you douchebags.
1373289	1373369	Um...
1374827	1377249	Anyways, and then I'm going to have some more download stuff as well.
1377269	1383092	I wanted to work on a theme and stuff, but seriously, I've been in my computer room forever.
1383292	1388475	I will post some screenshots, though, into chat so you can see a few screenshots I've taken.
1388875	1393718	But it's still a work in progress, and I'm hopefully going to have it done very soon.
1396440	1400182	Prowler in chatroom says, this is already better than last year's Microsoft press conference.
1400202	1400662	Well, thank you.
1401042	1401422	We try.
1401762	1405764	So any estimated time on when this is going to be out, like before the end of the month, August-ish?
1405784	1409466	I'm hoping before the end of next week, but we'll see.
1410147	1410487	All right.
1410787	1413988	Oh, and you've even posted a link of what one of the screenshots looks like to chat.
1414029	1414709	That's going to be awesome.
1415916	1416677	Oh, there's two coming.
1417297	1417577	Wow.
1417617	1418798	So our live listeners get to see it.
1418818	1424703	For those of you listening on the taped podcast, you can look at those on our forums quite soon.
1424743	1426124	Those will be up very soon on our forums.
1426464	1427265	OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1427285	1428106	Click on forums.
1428874	1430215	Alright, so that does it.
1430235	1433477	Again, to reiterate our three points of this year's E3 press conference.
1434498	1435679	E3 won't have us, so to hell with them.
1435699	1437220	We're going to PAX and it's going to be even better.
1437740	1451529	Part A and B will be combined starting next week with the podcast and the olrpsp.com new website and radio tuner application that takes you direct to allgames.com radio feed coming soon.
1453032	1465780	The PSP sucks and it doesn't, you know, unfortunately it takes a fucking long time to put pages on there because you make it in a program for the PC, you view it on your PC and it looks nice and you take it to your PSP and it looks like shit, so...
1467088	1468709	It's a long process.
1469470	1469770	Alright.
1470150	1475014	Well, anyhow, we are going to shift gears and get into our regular show tonight.
1475234	1478477	As if a press conference wasn't enough, we have a whole regular show to get to.
1478517	1480098	And that is tonight's gaming news.
1480178	1482220	And Loki, once again, starting us off with tonight's gaming news.
1482540	1482840	Alright.
1483801	1491767	Well, this is not a big surprise, but Konami has launched a patent suit against Harmonix and MTV over Rock Band.
1492828	1492968	And...
1493888	1495069	I don't know.
1495910	1503977	There's definitely, I guess, some merit to it, seeing as it looks very similar to Guitar Freak's Drum Mania, the whole setup.
1504318	1506019	I'm just surprised that it took them this long.
1507300	1514407	But, I mean, maybe they're not licensing the technology like Guitar Hero is, so...
1516269	1518712	If that's the case, you know, I do think Konami's owed some money.
1518932	1521535	Although it is kind of cheap to do that and then release their game.
1522035	1524718	Which, their game looks like a cheap knockoff of Rock Band.
1524818	1528783	I don't know, it's just... I wish they had done this a lot sooner.
1528963	1533067	Like, put out their game instead of just bitching about the other games coming out.
1533308	1536091	Katamari's Forever in chat says, Confusing lawsuit is confusing.
1537740	1538520	It is kind of in-depth.
1538540	1540661	What is it that Konami is specifically taking issue?
1540701	1542842	The way I understood it, it kind of has to do with the controller.
1543202	1550704	It's not necessarily so much the game itself, but it seems to be the fact that it's a guitar controller very similar to what Guitar Freaks was when it was out here in the U.S.
1551245	1554166	in very small arcade test markets a long time ago.
1554226	1555326	That's their point of contention.
1555946	1558647	Yeah, and they do have the patents in place for it.
1558807	1563629	I mean, I'm sure they do because it's been out for years now, so...
1564850	1567981	Yeah, I mean they're in the right there to defend their patent.
1568021	1569747	I just don't understand why they didn't defend it
1570816	1578420	When Rock Band first came out, I guess now that they figure there's money involved in it and they can make a lot of money off of it, then yeah, they should do it.
1578500	1587725	But at the same time, I kind of wish that they were just leading the music gaming industry instead of just trying to follow and just make money off of lawsuits.
1588486	1594029	Because now their new game, which to be honest, I don't really care too much about, and it looks kind of cheap.
1594569	1596290	So, I don't know.
1597714	1621376	personally I think it kind of stinks because you know obviously I enjoy rock band but it's kind of one of those things in the back of my mind I kind of always wondered you know if Konami sued those folks that did in the groove I'm kind of surprised they never tried to go after rock band and then especially after hearing that Activision's already been paying them under the table for quite some time for the you know the whole Guitar Hero thing and you know Red Octane and Konami have had a long relationship and
1621776	1638378	and then I kind of thought well maybe part of the reason this took so long to happen is because Harmonix and Konami have had somewhat of a long relationship too with the whole karaoke revolution thing but you know the whole timing of this lawsuit is awfully odd with their games coming out this year and everything and I think it kind of stinks but at the same time
1639099	1640439	I don't know, there might be some merit to it.
1640559	1642020	I just hope it doesn't stop Rock Band.
1660510	1661991	By the way, we called it too.
1662311	1665933	We said Konami's going to sue these folks when they try to invade the home market.
1666033	1670795	And sure enough, when that In The Groove game came out for PS2, that's when Konami sicked the bulldogs on them.
1671575	1675637	But it does make this whole thing interesting that Rock Band's been out for like a year, year and a half.
1675657	1678218	I mean, does it, well, not quite a year and a half, but about a year.
1678238	1680539	I mean, does it take that long for a lawsuit to get rolling?
1680880	1687843	No, it's just they want to see how successful it is now that it's finally come around and they're going to be putting out their sequel and stuff.
1689822	1694347	DarkSakura, do you have any thoughts on this?
1694367	1696689	Because I know you tweeted some stuff earlier in the week.
1696729	1699592	I'm curious kind of where your thought is at this point in time with the whole suit.
1700242	1713113	I think that it's petty and ridiculous they had their chance when and you know it's funny remember talking to Jason Anis all those years ago about trying to bring Bit Money into the U.S.
1713253	1724442	and working on getting Guitar Freaks and everything they had their chance and they had their advocate then did they hop on it no so someone came along and did it better
1725973	1726494	And you know what?
1726554	1734105	I think you're speaking a lot of the same things that the music game community is saying, is that there's this round of disappointment in Konami.
1734606	1739653	Because, you know, they had all these... This Beatmania series in Japan was awesome.
1739893	1740895	The 2DX series...
1741435	1741776	Awesome.
1742016	1743977	Guitar freaks, drum mania, people loved it.
1744017	1745258	People were importing that stuff.
1745558	1747580	And everybody was asking, why aren't you bringing it out here?
1747620	1748420	Why aren't you bringing it out here?
1748700	1756346	And it took one of their own people on the USA side, Jason, to twist the fucking arm of the Japanese side.
1756366	1757507	And we barely got DDR.
1757547	1759208	And you barely got DDR.
1759348	1761229	And then DDR was a huge success.
1761289	1764572	And remember how shitty that first mix of DDR was.
1764592	1765512	But everyone wanted it.
1765572	1766193	Everyone was happy.
1766833	1787417	and then it would just cause a landslide to DDR after that and look how successful it's been and then you know Beatmania 2DX the problem was they didn't learn from their mistakes they released a kind of a shoddy 2DX mix I mean they took some risks with it which were kind of cool at the whole five key thing but it just wasn't enough they didn't take enough risks with licensing that's where Guitar Hero and Rock Band whooped them is that they knew what
1787597	1790079	What the American audience wanted and they went for it.
1790619	1799025	And I'm sorry if this offends you, otaku folks and anime folks and J-pop loving folks that like the Bomani songs that are in the 2DX.
1799365	1802147	But all of those songs would never have worked here.
1802847	1805609	And that's kind of proven by the 2DX release over here.
1806229	1807570	It needed more.
1807991	1811813	And that crappy cover of Toxic and one Moby song, that wasn't enough.
1812153	1813734	It needed like half and half at least.
1814095	1816496	It needed more songs that could have reached out to the American audience.
1816576	1817137	But anyhow.
1818738	1831325	So, but my question is, despite the kind of resentment we almost feel towards Konami for not taking the freaking risk sooner and now looking almost like a copycat with this whole Rock Revolution thing, does it make it right, though?
1831745	1834527	Does it make it still that their lawsuit doesn't have any ground to stand on?
1834567	1838589	Because as disappointed as I am in Konami, I still go, but they have a point.
1840942	1841302	I don't know.
1841783	1842583	Any thoughts on that?
1843004	1846266	Do you still think it's petty?
1847067	1847747	It's still petty.
1848588	1849208	It's still petty.
1849268	1852010	And on top of that, the format, I think, is so different.
1856513	1864719	The other thing that has to be is whether or not they actually did, in effect, go and re-engineer what Konami had done.
1865220	1869623	How long was the trademark out for their controllers?
1870003	1873825	And plus, I think Red Octane knew what they were doing when they originally put out Guitar Hero.
1873845	1874786	They knew what they were doing.
1874906	1876967	And that's why there's those under-the-table payments.
1878248	1878888	That's what we're calling it.
1878908	1879489	But you know what I mean.
1879889	1881850	To Konami.
1882511	1885713	But Harmonix should have known what they were getting into as well.
1886433	1887974	And I love Harmonix.
1887994	1889235	Harmonix makes some great games.
1889255	1890435	That's what kind of makes this disappointing.
1890455	1892557	But they kind of should have known that this might happen.
1893237	1894518	That's just kind of disappointing.
1895099	1897741	I don't know.
1897881	1901164	Going off some comments from chat, because I'm sure there's a lot of folks in chat.
1901424	1906028	Gerardimo says, 2DX was based on the assumption that only DDR players had heard of would be playing this.
1906068	1908590	That's why just about all the songs on it are in DDR.
1909531	1912052	Kind of, but they really pushed Beatmania at E3.
1912112	1923334	Like, it was their big title, but then the title itself, by the time it comes out, I mean, God, remember that G4 clip where they were calling it a Guitar Hero knockoff and all the Bimani fanboys were getting angry?
1923874	1924354	Remember that?
1925554	1928515	And then some talk as well in chat about the whole MTV drumscape thing.
1928535	1931656	Shouldn't MTV already have some type of patents on drums because of drumscape?
1932056	1935956	Well, even if they have patents on drums, they may not have patents on guitar, and I think that's Konami's issue.
1936056	1937997	I don't think Konami was doing anything about the drums.
1938237	1938517	I don't know.
1938956	1942897	Technically, Konami could be sued by the creators of several of the MIDI guitars, too.
1943858	1944398	Or Gibson.
1945258	1954301	Well, yeah, but... Well, Konami's guitars, when they first came out, they didn't really resemble any type of real, you know, form of guitar.
1954361	1958262	It was fairly, I'd say, an innocent design, if you know what I mean.
1958523	1958663	Right.
1959143	1959363	But...
1961471	1968699	But seriously, the MIDI guitars, especially ones that have worked on Switch like that, have existed for, you know, since the 80s at least.
1970589	1974931	GameGuru in chat says, if Immersion could win against Sony, Konami can win against EA.
1975231	1978152	And I think it's going to be settled out of court one way or another.
1978652	1978972	I think.
1978992	1980153	I think that's what's going to happen.
1980533	1983394	Hopefully it doesn't prevent Rock Band 2 or delay it any further.
1983674	1984294	I don't think it will.
1984574	1985535	Yeah, I don't think it will either.
1985555	1986575	I think it'll settle out of court.
1986595	1989336	I think they're going to have to make those payments similar to what Activision is doing.
1989756	1991297	But the problem is, Konami...
1992418	1993238	Thanks for watching!
2011986	2014087	Rock Revolution focuses more on drums, not guitar.
2014107	2014548	Including keyboard.
2039761	2040801	It focuses on everything.
2040861	2046263	Rock band, they have solid vocals, they have solid guitars and drums, tracks.
2046663	2048163	It's not just one or the other.
2048804	2049044	Alright.
2049464	2051784	Well, more to come on this as the weeks go by.
2051804	2060547	I'm sure we'll hear about the settlement very soon or at least some type of further comment from Harmonix and Viacom and all those people outside of this is stupid.
2061207	2074194	Anyhow, speaking of Konami and their music games, DDR is still trekking along, and Dance Dance Revolution X is the new game that is coming out on the PlayStation 2 later this year, and there's more DDR games coming out for the home consoles.
2074614	2078696	But what might have surprised some people, this is also going to be an arcade port.
2078997	2081458	Dance Dance Revolution X will be coming to the arcades, and...
2081898	2083499	It is a whole new cabinet.
2083519	2085760	It looks like it's actually something on a widescreen monitor.
2086321	2095986	There are some pictures that have been posted over at BomaniStyle.com, which I believe came from that ZenisaiVanisher site of an actual new cabinet and what it looks like.
2096467	2100469	Some of the names have been changed, like Beginner Mode is Starter Mode, Advanced Mode, Course Mode.
2100969	2107833	There's now Shock Arrows in the game, which is basically mines, although I seem to recall DDR has had Poison Arrows before.
2107873	2109134	It was in one of the Ultramix games.
2109174	2109634	Go back and look.
2110435	2110515	Um...
2111075	2113057	There's also going to be the link feature.
2113497	2116220	USB cards will now handle edit data.
2117061	2117441	Sweet!
2117741	2121445	Yeah, edit data is coming back to the DDR series thanks to a USB memory cord.
2121785	2125388	And apparently, good edit data is going to go worldwide on e-amusement.
2126243	2130145	The most commonly played stuff will be back in the game.
2130625	2132626	Older songs possibly making a comeback.
2133426	2144430	60 plus new songs including licenses and new originals and developers say that they are committed to putting 1.5 times the amount of new content in future mixes.
2144830	2148552	And another thing I believe I was hearing about this, Betson is now not involved in this.
2148672	2150013	They were doing the cabinets for Supernova.
2150053	2152073	Apparently they are not involved in this any longer.
2152133	2153834	That could be part of the reason.
2153874	2155735	I'm not sure though about all the changes.
2156275	2159517	More information to come when these machines start being spotted out there in the wild.
2159738	2162660	Konami's still trying to do stuff with their DDR series.
2162680	2167143	Definitely.
2167503	2170606	At least one of those tracks is probably going to be pretty good.
2171526	2175029	And now there's folks saying that the Poison Arrows thing is taken from in the groove.
2175049	2184036	But correct me if I'm wrong, in one of the early, early DDR games, like Second Mix or some crap, wasn't there a mode where there were arrows that you weren't supposed to step on?
2184736	2188658	Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought in one of the earlier DDR mixes there was something like that.
2189778	2190078	I don't know.
2190899	2193020	I think maybe in the challenge mode there was something like that.
2193280	2197241	Well, there was also the one where you weren't supposed to step on any arrows that weren't currently up on the screen.
2198570	2202592	Oh well, I don't think it's anything that surprising, honestly.
2202953	2206955	Anyway, I didn't really call to mind things that much innovation in the first place.
2208116	2215360	Sure, it was something new, but it didn't exactly reinvent the game, so I don't think it's that big a deal that Konami's kind of putting it in this new game.
2216060	2218022	I kind of think they're a little dumb anyway.
2218042	2221303	I hope they don't overuse them, but we'll see.
2221944	2223565	So, coming to arcades soon.
2225481	2242089	Well, something that makes me happy in particular, and this makes me uber happy, is that there is going to be another Sega Aegis PS2 release that is the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection, which was...
2243830	2249456	I do think Fantasy Zone 2 DX before, but hey, it's more Fantasy Zone.
2249576	2255922	And I hope it's actually done up like the Sega Ages one that I already have on PS2.
2255942	2261728	It was part of the Sega Ages 2500 set, which was named that because it was 2,500 yen per
2264991	2279163	But this is supposed to be, from what this says on here, Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2, Fantasy Zone Gear, Super Fantasy Zone, Opa Opa Galactic Protector, Fantasy Zone 2 Remake, and the Sega Ages 2500 Volume 3 Fantasy Zone version.
2281846	2283567	Sounds like a lot of Fantasy Zone.
2283607	2284007	Get ready.
2284027	2286950	Sounds like do want, because I think I actually have most of these.
2288131	2291474	I wonder if Opa Opa was Fantasy Zone 3 The Maze.
2292372	2295753	Especially if there's some updated graphics and sound and all that's usually a good thing.
2297294	2298234	I want an Opa Opa.
2298254	2300015	A little plushie or something?
2300595	2301655	I know, I do want one.
2301735	2302796	Who knows, maybe they'll be showing this.
2302816	2304396	Maybe I should cosplay the Opa Opa one year.
2304576	2307277	Maybe they'll show this at Tokyo Game Show or something, a little more in it.
2307417	2307777	We'll see.
2308657	2315400	I told you this story, Rob, but one time I was trying to look for the Opa Opa music and ended up downloading a happy song in Greek.
2315880	2316840	It's called Opa Opa.
2316860	2319101	Because that means, like, yay in Greek.
2320154	2320674	Interesting.
2321054	2322935	I'm sure it was a better song than Carameldansen.
2323075	2323795	I'm sure that's for sure.
2323955	2324595	Actually, yes, it is.
2324615	2325075	Yeah, all right.
2325135	2331216	Anyway, Fantasy Zone is still a ways out, but we have some stuff coming out a lot sooner than that, right, Loki?
2331376	2331636	Yes.
2332617	2337778	This week, there's some pretty interesting stuff coming out, actually, especially if you like football.
2337838	2348760	There's NCAA March Madness, NCAA Football 09, and that's coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and the PSP.
2349981	2363399	and also there is a game based off the looks like crap movie but Space Chimps that will be out on PC, Playstation 2, the Wii and I believe the 360 and DS.
2367022	2371523	Also, Hunting Unlimited 2009 coming to the PC.
2371743	2372764	That looks like shit as well.
2374704	2377365	Code Lyoko Quest for Infinity on PSP.
2378185	2381146	Nancy Drew, The Cluebender Society on the DS.
2382266	2391948	For those who may have Rock Band on PlayStation 2 or Wii, you'll get your Rock Band Track Pack Volume 1 this week, which has 30 songs you can play.
2392568	2394669	Let's see here.
2397633	2413273	and I think that's about it I mean they're trying to keep it I guess a little bit light next week though or the week after next is actually gonna be pretty nice with Final Fantasy 4 so I would imagine though there's gonna be some surprises with the whole E3 thing at least as far as downloadable stuff goes
2413513	2414894	Dark Messiah Might and Magic Elements 360
2440288	2440829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2457881	2458982	Kakun no Daichi.
2459662	2465546	That is a game coming from Aqua Plus and it not only comes out in Japan but all Asia regions on the PlayStation 3.
2466647	2470469	Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii, Boom Blox gets its Japanese release this week.
2471150	2473211	That's a game I have that I still need to play.
2473251	2474612	I bought it and I haven't even played it yet.
2475332	2476133	Thank you for watching.
2476173	2476673	See you next time.
2498826	2499607	Dragon Quest V
2513843	2514804	You know I gotta get this.
2514904	2521649	Hello Kitty No Panda Sports Stadium comes out on the DS, as well as Metal Slug 7 comes out this week in Japan.
2522209	2529094	And with the Hello Kitty game, some new Hello Kitty pouches in pink and white, so you can carry your game in style.
2529134	2533898	And if that doesn't work for you, how about the Sugar Bunnies pouch that comes out in blue and pink?
2534438	2537581	It's a very girly week in the Nintendo DS world.
2537861	2540363	But hey, at least you have Metal Gear on PlayStation 3 to counteract that.
2540703	2541704	I was mesmerized.
2541724	2542304	I know.
2542344	2542524	Awesome.
2562555	2587707	I have four games that are going to be out in the next week and I'm going to go ahead and name one for next Sunday too just because by the time I say anything on that day it'd be too late so given that it'll be the next day already so for the UK we have three games in the 18th we have well actually two different systems Baroque on PS2 and Wii and Guitar Hero on Tour on DS which is not all that fun
2588727	2589107	Sorry.
2589948	2590448	Spoiler!
2591429	2596072	And then on the 20th, CID 925 and Ordinary Life on PSP.
2598033	2599915	Small week for Europe, sadly.
2600295	2601136	Very small.
2601356	2608260	But also I think our Europe releases, they really only cover the big, big stuff and not a lot of the little stuff like we have over in Japan.
2608921	2610662	This list we use has everything on it.
2610722	2613604	Not necessarily all AAA titles.
2614865	2616266	How about Virtual Console over in the UK?
2616286	2616486	Okay.
2617034	2618955	We do have some fun for the virtual console.
2620496	2625280	The first one, sorry, I love the description that Eurogamer gives it.
2625660	2626481	I'm going to quote.
2627521	2633886	The first of these is Ninja Commando, a top-down vertically scrolling shooter that has ninja and commandos and time travel.
2634226	2636368	It also has a rubbish but very funny English translation.
2637444	2638625	That's the best description ever.
2639205	2640166	I cracked up when I saw it.
2640186	2641747	Ninjas, Commandos, what else do you need?
2642107	2642548	Time travel.
2643048	2643548	Time travel.
2643728	2644489	Now what else do you need?
2644669	2644989	That's it.
2645129	2647191	A rubbish English translation.
2648492	2648912	Perfect.
2649012	2649833	Everything I want in a game.
2650033	2650533	Make your time.
2650553	2650793	Zeroing.
2651774	2662381	Anyway, Art of Fighting 2 is another one, which is just a fighting game, but it had tons of jokes for Capcom came from that.
2662521	2663882	Do you know the Art of Fighting game?
2665402	2668825	and it's the game series that also spawned us our Dan Hibiki.
2669125	2670266	It has a fighter named after me.
2670306	2670806	That's all I need.
2672427	2672607	Yes.
2672647	2672908	Robert.
2674008	2674269	Hello.
2674549	2675409	You should cosplay him.
2675990	2676410	No, thank you.
2676610	2677991	With the big ponytail and everything.
2678011	2678412	No, thank you.
2678672	2687198	Anyway, the Neo Geo games are going to be 900 Wii points translating to 9 euros or 6 pounds 30.
2688299	2689460	So, go get them.
2691161	2691742	That's an order.
2692082	2693523	After E3, you should probably have some more fun.
2694997	2707403	Yep, now I'm sure this came to a big surprise to everybody this morning, but Microsoft has confirmed that, guess what, the Xbox 360 20GB Pro system has dropped in price to $299.
2707924	2709244	I am so surprised.
2709284	2710705	That is a big shocker.
2711325	2722851	And also surprising, and completely not already leaked already, that they will be introducing a new 60GB console that's going to be arriving early August that will be the current $349.
2725052	2726673	So they're not really dropping the price.
2727434	2729736	They're just kind of upgrading for the same price.
2730016	2733518	So at the press conference tomorrow, you guys, act surprised.
2734979	2736140	Just act surprised.
2737561	2738122	Exactly.
2738542	2740684	Especially when they mention the avatars and stuff.
2740784	2742365	Pretend that you didn't hear it already.
2743610	2747093	or that you didn't hear about some of the Lips rumors leaking out there on the internet.
2747374	2750917	You know, we have never heard of this game called Lips that apparently is under development.
2751678	2762028	But here's the thing, Variety Magazine, which is a magazine really for the industry of entertainment, it covers mostly movies, television, music, that stuff, but it does dabble in gaming.
2762808	2765851	And it talked in a recent article about the Lips project.
2765911	2768614	So, you know, hello, if that wasn't confirmation, what do you need?
2769054	2770474	It is going to be at E3.
2770594	2772755	Apparently, some of the box art has leaked out.
2772795	2773275	But get this.
2773675	2777696	Not only that, but the wireless microphones have apparently leaked out as well.
2777736	2779296	So that's pretty cool that they're wireless microphones.
2779316	2779736	But get this.
2780056	2780616	I love this.
2781176	2783797	The microphones apparently have lights in them.
2784177	2792179	At the base of the microphone have these colored lights that are supposedly... I guess they're like two rings of light that are blue or red.
2792659	2795579	And apparently, the way you sing controls the lights.
2796180	2798600	So I guess it's one of those things where maybe it's
2798740	2800782	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2826359	2829341	I'll bet you anything that little camera works with the game too.
2829362	2829902	What do you want to bet?
2831163	2835146	Well, I hope it works with something because, you know, I paid good money for that camera.
2835186	2837427	Exactly, and now we hardly ever get to use it.
2838808	2840730	But no, this game does sound cool already.
2840850	2850457	I'm very curious to see what the actual game itself... Because even though we've seen the box art, we've seen the mics, we've seen the concept, we know it's probably most likely being developed by the Elite Beat Agents folks.
2850757	2851798	We have yet to see screens.
2853219	2868009	I'm gonna take a wild guess here and call me a psychic, but I'm gonna guess that they're gonna look something very similar to SingStar, Karaoke Revolution, Rock Band, and probably Guitar Hero World Tour.
2868669	2870851	It would be rad, though, if it was something kinda different.
2871351	2871851	You never know.
2872252	2873933	Except it probably won't be.
2874053	2874813	It probably won't.
2875614	2876574	Stop it, Debbie Downer.
2878055	2878815	Raining on my parade.
2879456	2881617	Gerardimo says, if you sing badly, do you get a light show?
2881917	2884579	Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com That would be kind of cool.
2885039	2885659	Light show.
2886560	2889782	Why do you deserve a light show if you suck?
2891103	2891483	I don't know.
2891563	2893204	Maybe it's a consolation prize?
2893344	2893644	Who knows?
2894245	2898207	But Lips, that's one of the titles I can't wait to hear about at the Microsoft press conference.
2899366	2900867	Well, you'll have to wait.
2901547	2902167	I'm sorry, Rob.
2903088	2908210	I know, but it's being streamed online like everywhere, and it's supposed to be on TV and all this stuff.
2908270	2909931	I'm going to watch it during work tomorrow.
2910211	2917474	Sadly, I have to teach tomorrow, so I can't watch the conference during work, but I will be refreshing some of the gaming blogs on my break to see what's announced.
2917967	2920248	Well, how is this for some happy information?
2921268	2929691	Mega Man 9 is actually, they said it was going to be WiiWare coming onto Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
2930972	2934413	That's going to be kind of weird playing a Nintendo-style game on Xbox Live.
2934833	2935374	But that's cool.
2935914	2936094	Yeah.
2936394	2938395	Now I don't have to worry about storage issues on my Wii.
2938475	2939535	Hooray.
2939655	2941756	Some sort of HD version, though.
2942036	2942756	Sucks for you.
2942776	2943116	Or 360.
2943497	2944217	That would be kind of cool.
2944257	2946878	Sucks for you, Nintendo, because I was going to buy that game and now I'm not.
2947622	2948263	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2969994	2971355	Warcraft joke, but I'm serious.
2971375	2975018	That's what she kind of looked like in the trailer, like one of those Poseidon ladies.
2976039	2977460	And some of the other robots are kind of cool too.
2977500	2980723	You can only see their silhouettes, but I am all kinds of excited about Mega Man 9.
2981223	2988049	I would be more excited if they come out at E3 and say it's available now, but I doubt it, seeing as we've already heard rumors of a September release date, but...
2989625	2990565	Still, that's not that far off.
2991065	2992086	Yeah.
2992666	3000548	Something else that's not very far off, too, is a rumored silver DS system, which will be coming out in the U.S.
3002288	3005769	Now, the story actually is coming from GoNintendo.
3005829	3011911	They have a source that says that the... I guess the DS that was with...
3013891	3016456	I don't know what they're talking about.
3016977	3018220	I mean, that's totally news to me.
3026286	3035331	Yeah, I would be very surprised if we saw it in September or something, and it was actually the silver and black DS that was with the Guitar Hero bundle.
3035851	3037252	That would be really surprising.
3037272	3037932	Wouldn't that be neat?
3038032	3038672	That would be neat.
3038892	3039393	Surprising.
3039593	3041034	Completely surprised.
3041074	3043495	Just as surprising as Microsoft's press conference will be tomorrow.
3044295	3046516	But folks do really need more colors for the DS.
3046556	3047337	I mean, seriously.
3048697	3049078	I guess.
3049118	3049858	They're still selling.
3050258	3051179	What about Wii colors?
3051259	3053100	You think Nintendo's going to give us some Wii colors finally?
3053340	3053460	No.
3055120	3055660	DarkSakura.com
3072165	3073245	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3089271	3095512	Now the thing, because the game costs supposedly 1,337 Microsoft points, which I'm sure is a joke.
3095532	3096933	Well, same for the trial, though, too.
3097033	3099033	Actually going to charge that, yeah, and it shows that the trial.
3099353	3102794	But it also kind of makes you go, hmm, could it be a Photoshop or something?
3102814	3103694	It could be a Photoshop.
3103714	3104014	It could be.
3104174	3114356	But what's interesting about it is that apparently some achievements have also leaked for the game, including one called Looks Like a Cleanup on Aisle 4 is the achievement.
3115056	3117977	And to get that, you have to step in a pile of poop.
3119301	3122022	I wish I was joking, but that is really the achievement.
3122142	3126103	And the picture of the achievement looks like a pile of poop.
3127183	3129984	Which makes me think this is even more of a fake, but you never know.
3130004	3131364	They had poop in the game.
3131724	3136026	Yeah, I know, but if these screenshots are fake, it's a damn good fake.
3136686	3137266	I'll give them that.
3139983	3141985	But we'll find out, I'm sure, tomorrow.
3143227	3145049	Would you think that this might be one of their games?
3145089	3146471	Like, they did this with Doom, didn't they?
3146511	3147913	Didn't they come out at some European conference?
3147933	3151096	We can't have five Xbox Live Arcade games coming out tomorrow.
3151277	3151777	Sure we could.
3151797	3152298	Or next week.
3152558	3153139	Sure we could.
3153319	3154761	I would like that, but we can't.
3154781	3155502	I think we all would.
3156889	3157469	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3185319	3188641	Whoever faked it, I hope you burn in hell for getting my hopes up.
3189341	3192302	I hope you step in many piles of poop for the rest of your life.
3192823	3195444	There's a wonderful Middle Eastern curse that applies.
3195684	3196064	What's that?
3196264	3198585	May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals.
3198865	3199686	Yes, and poop.
3201146	3201967	In your genitals.
3203067	3204148	Ha ha, poop in your genitals.
3205969	3209070	This show is rated T for trashy, for all the toilet humor.
3209430	3210831	It's rated P for poo-poo.
3211131	3211431	Alright.
3212672	3214913	Speaking of poo-poo... Hey!
3218198	3220540	The King of Poopy Headedness He Who Shall Not Be Named
3240498	3245319	is Jack Thompson, and it will actually, it will change it to Lord Voldemort for you.
3245359	3246460	Well done, Loki, well done.
3246660	3250360	Alright, so yes, what is the latest in Jack, I mean, Lord Voldemort world?
3252461	3267445	Well, the judge who is, I think, is in charge of the trial, Davatunis, I guess is the name, has referred to he who shall not be named as mentally impaired and
3269273	3270614	A raving wild woman.
3271915	3273296	Wait, a raving wild woman?
3274137	3276198	No, Thompson referred to her as that.
3276238	3276579	I'm sorry.
3276599	3277139	Oh, I gotcha.
3277679	3280201	He referred to her as mentally impaired and a raving wild woman.
3280281	3281102	My bad.
3281162	3284184	I wish a judge would refer to him as a raving wild woman.
3284605	3285565	You crazy bitch.
3285705	3286166	Sit down.
3286766	3295032	Well, the judge has recommended that dude be assessed a $43,675 fine for legal costs incurred by the Florida Bar Association.
3298955	3308281	and he has been found guilty of 27 of 31 charges in a misconduct suit and the judge wants him disbarred.
3308741	3310983	I love that they have it figured out down to the dollar.
3311003	3312444	You know what would make that even better?
3312804	3314345	If it was figured out down to the cent.
3314805	3316746	It is figured out down to the cents, actually.
3316946	3318287	On Kotaku, they had the cents.
3318327	3319528	It was like $36.35 or something.
3319548	3320108	It was $0.35, I remember that.
3325034	3327399	Hugs and kisses to the folks who made that happen then.
3327519	3329102	He should be forced to pay it on sight.
3330344	3330725	To me.
3332549	3333731	No, to the Florida bar.
3333992	3334633	Alright, fine.
3335154	3335635	But then to me.
3336096	3337038	He's just a fucker.
3340290	3340950	And you know what?
3342752	3354581	As much as this is actually kind of good news in a way that maybe he'll finally be forced to go away, although I'm sure he'll troll all the blogs still, just hearing that name, Lord Voldemort, inspires fear and anger in me.
3355862	3359565	So we'll be getting to the FUs of the week soon, but there's more, apparently.
3359765	3364809	I just wanted to read the actual first line on this one, because I actually did check on GamePolitics.
3365330	3365550	It says,
3375457	3387825	The case involves factual findings of cumulative misconduct, a repeated pattern of behavior relentlessly forced upon numerous unconnected individuals, a total lack of remorse or even slight acknowledgement of inappropriate conduct.
3390187	3390387	So...
3392188	3395071	The bottom two things that I'll read.
3395091	3396273	Go ahead and skip to the last paragraph.
3396633	3397574	This middle name's Bruce.
3411989	3413331	Fleas in your pants.
3413751	3413932	More.
3413972	3414532	In your genitals.
3414853	3418497	A, permanent disbarment with no leave to reapply for admission.
3419258	3421481	B, disciplinary costs currently totaling $43,675.35.
3421842	3422062	Nice.
3422082	3422723	Currently totaling.
3422783	3423624	Can we bring on the Yanks now?
3446980	3449502	Apparently news about Lord Voldemort makes you gassy.
3450603	3453325	I was opening my mouth to say something and it said I had a juice burp.
3453565	3454966	Nice.
3456227	3457188	Multi-part F you.
3457308	3460570	Number one, to the heat returning.
3461391	3469077	And number two, to people who think...
3470625	3478171	They have the right to tell someone else what to say or do or think just because they themselves are offended.
3479071	3479592	You know what I mean?
3480693	3483054	Why don't people learn how to fucking roll with the punches?
3483094	3484195	This has to be a co-worker.
3484555	3484695	No.
3485216	3485656	Oh, okay.
3485676	3486397	Just in general.
3486777	3487918	It's really not a co-worker.
3487938	3488858	It's just in general.
3488918	3496144	I've sort of hit a point of saturation where I'm so sick with all these people who are like, I don't like what you did, Sue.
3497978	3523437	or you you said a mean thing about me and sue and you know just people who don't know how to get the fuck over themselves and get on with it you know what since somebody says something shitty about you fuck them why should it matter and also on the same lines um f you to anyone and I'm gonna say it fuck you to anyone who tries to tell me how I should talk
3524710	3525671	This is America.
3526371	3541002	There's nothing in the Constitution that limits my ability to say fuck, shit, damn, cock, or any other so-called curse word that I wish to say in any type of form unless it is specifically said as part of a private organization that these words are not allowed.
3541322	3543323	As in, like, part of my employment say.
3543623	3544204	That's fine.
3544544	3547466	But I can stand outside of my place of employment and go, fuck!
3548187	3548827	All I want to.
3549347	3549888	And it's illegal.
3552287	3557671	And by the way, DarkSakura, the lawyers will be calling about the lawsuit with the FLEs in my genitals.
3558091	3560914	I also plan on cursing in front of my children.
3562915	3563676	I'll tell you why.
3563696	3565958	The Osborne kids came down only slightly fucked up.
3566258	3568960	I had a discussion about this with my friend who's a parent as well.
3569380	3574904	And she said she's not going to have any problem with, you know, say a kid falls and goes, oh damn, or shit, that hurts.
3575445	3581449	She's not going to have a problem with it, but have a problem if someone uses it specifically in a derogatory or attacking way.
3581690	3581930	Right.
3582370	3584132	So, teach someone to be nice.
3584172	3586633	You can learn when it's appropriate and when it's not appropriate.
3587054	3594840	But I'm not going to discourage my children, if I ever have any, to have to curtail their own freedom of speech for somebody else's comfort.
3595961	3597422	I don't have kids yet.
3597782	3598483	Maybe someday.
3598563	3600725	But I'm still kind of thinking kind of a similar thing.
3600765	3604087	Because if you don't make it such a bad thing, then kids won't want to do it.
3604107	3605068	It's not going to be a big deal.
3605088	3605488	Exactly.
3605889	3608231	You know, half the reason why I think that a lot of...
3608871	3613192	Misty in chat says, See, that's another reason I don't have an intention of having demon spawn.
3638482	3640224	I'm actually thinking in the next two years.
3641425	3641946	Oh my heck.
3643187	3643848	That could be something.
3643888	3645129	All right, Loki, your FU is the week.
3645309	3648012	And I'm going to probably still be here every Sunday.
3649674	3650294	With the baby?
3651175	3651496	Maybe.
3652296	3653357	No, I'm going to make Dan babysit.
3653598	3653858	All right.
3654318	3657462	Anyway, Loki, FU the PSP web browser for sucking.
3659314	3660015	That's all I got.
3660415	3661296	Yeah, mine's short too.
3661316	3662257	F you to smoke.
3662397	3666801	And I don't mean the fighter in Mortal Kombat 3 or 4 or whatever, even though he kind of sucked too.
3667502	3671805	I'm talking about the smoke that's out there in the air, like a fucking volcano blew up in my backyard.
3672386	3673067	It's pretty horrible.
3673127	3678591	And thankfully I don't still live up in Chico where all the fires are happening, because I hear up in Chico it's raining ash.
3679152	3682235	Can you imagine if you walked outside one day and it's raining ash?
3682895	3683596	That sucks.
3684076	3685938	It's like you are actually living in hell.
3687842	3688763	or Dante's Peak.
3691105	3693487	Without... Or Pompeii the day before.
3693767	3696930	Yeah, without frickin' what's-her-name-for-the-Terminator being there.
3699032	3699312	Alright.
3699692	3699993	Alright.
3701834	3704596	Well, there's more rumors.
3704616	3705637	We have to say this.
3705677	3706058	I'm sorry.
3706478	3709841	Gulp Banjo in chat says, Jamie, have the baby live on air.
3710441	3711843	It could be an educational thing.
3712223	3713024	The miracle of life.
3713044	3713164	Really?
3716697	3725802	I've already discussed it, but I plan on when I do squirt out my own demon spawn, I'm going to have a midwife and do it at home.
3726122	3727362	When the parasite crawls out?
3728763	3734186	Actually, it's funny, my friend, and Becky is so awesome, we kept referring to her baby as her symbiote.
3735060	3736401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3757896	3763981	Well, these controllers, you may be able to use it to shove organs of your enemies up into their ribcage.
3764501	3765843	But, I don't know.
3766343	3772348	Anyways, there's a rumor, there's still rumors going around that Microsoft's going to reveal some sort of motion controllers.
3772968	3776111	And if that's true, then they're thinking that maybe that these...
3776891	3781495	Modus Games' Darwin controllers are actually the 360 motion controllers.
3781955	3783957	Well, there's a few reasons why they may think that.
3784097	3786199	One, the controllers kind of fit the color scheme.
3786859	3793204	They are white plastic and they've got four lights on them indicating that you use four at one time.
3793825	3800110	What kind of makes them a little bit different than, say, the Wii Remote and stuff like that, they're kind of...
3801571	3803252	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3818231	3822853	Showing them being used in Tiger Woods, Lego, Star Wars, stuff like that.
3823293	3826854	So they look pretty cool, and they work pretty much just like the Wii Remote and Nunchuck.
3827375	3832417	But they are wireless, which is nice, so you don't have stupid cord tethering you together.
3833837	3834117	I don't know.
3834438	3838339	I guess we'll find out tomorrow, or today, depending on when you listen to the podcast.
3838719	3839079	Alright.
3839319	3839780	Stay tuned.
3840320	3842921	I'm sure we'll be talking a lot, a lot about the E3 announcements next week.
3843801	3845942	Do you think Microsoft getting into motion control is a good thing?
3847423	3847803	I don't know.
3848450	3848810	I don't know.
3849130	3850071	It would depend on how they did it.
3850911	3852792	And hopefully it would be optional stuff.
3854173	3856614	Do you think that they would try to release a Wii Sports style game?
3856654	3857695	It's like their passion game.
3857715	3859215	Or do you think that would be completely obvious?
3859736	3861116	I think that would be kind of stupid.
3861437	3867340	But I could see if they did put out Motion Controller that you would get a lot more of those crappy games on the 360.
3870290	3870991	XBOX Live Arcade
3881888	3889893	But their whole thing right now is they're trying to get a piece of that casual market that Nintendo seems to have kind of a hold of.
3890373	3895996	I think what's more interesting is what's Sony going to do?
3896877	3898798	Because they want to get into the casual market as well.
3898838	3900899	We haven't heard too much about what they're going to do.
3901319	3904761	And there were rumors a long time ago about new controllers and stuff like that.
3904902	3906582	So maybe they're going to do something too.
3907603	3908023	Who knows?
3908404	3908864	We'll see.
3909431	3910532	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3933093	3958046	and um so what happened the game was completely reworked now rated m all the oh was it it was rated m and now they got a rate at t so all the the references to booze were taken out of the game and now the game is pong toss pong toss instead of beer pong you get pong toss but you know whatever i think either way the game's gonna gotta be hokey i mean if you're gonna play beer pong if i could play beer pong
3958985	3959445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3985566	3986087	How much is that?
3986127	3987348	This one's supposed to be on the marketplace?
3987588	3987908	Do we know?
3988088	3989349	Probably like five or ten bucks.
3989469	3992712	It better be five because ten is way too much for that.
3993313	3996275	Okay, now we're going to get to the mailbag part of the program.
3996295	4003422	This is the part where you can send in your emails every week to mailbag at orangelawntrader.com and we read them live on air for our amusement and to poke fun at you.
4003602	4004102	No, just kidding.
4004122	4005664	But if you ask a good question, we'll answer it.
4005704	4007946	So let's open up the old mailbag, DarkSakura.
4008546	4009467	See what the listeners have to say.
4012628	4016072	We have letters, but only three, four.
4016572	4019015	That's right, it's a short show, short mailbag.
4019155	4020977	Well, we got a letter from Rob with two Bs.
4023119	4023860	Yay, Rob with two Bs.
4024280	4027804	It says, this is mostly for Sky and Loki because DS dropped me already.
4029986	4030867	I did not drop you.
4030907	4032569	I'm telling you right now, I did not drop you.
4032969	4034551	That's Dan's friends list.
4035712	4041118	I was using Dan's friends list with him for a while, and he has removed people that he does not know.
4041578	4043460	So that was not me, it was my husband.
4043500	4044502	Is this an Xbox Live thing?
4044622	4044882	Yes.
4045162	4046744	Okay.
4046864	4047845	I did not drop you.
4048646	4049387	I did not drop you.
4050047	4053751	I know, it makes it sound like we dropped him like a $2 hooker, and that's not the case.
4054012	4054292	Drop him.
4056792	4060116	It's not that I want to be dropped, but rather that I don't play many online games.
4060136	4063440	The only decent but humbling online play was with Rob and friends on Halo 2.
4063760	4068886	Whenever I play online, I get overwhelmed by radical and social epithets, so there's little incentive to go online.
4070245	4075849	If I ever become a big online game player in a particular game that one of you has, I may re-request later.
4075869	4079572	Also, my second Xbox 360 died, so I haven't played anything on it for a while.
4080753	4083375	By the way, I do have my own gamer tag.
4083455	4086197	I don't use it, but as soon as I remember what it is, I'll let you know.
4087218	4087878	And I won't delete you.
4089119	4096885	On an unrelated note, did you try to switch your controller assignment from 1 to 2 when fighting Screaming Mantis on Metal Gear Solid 4?
4096985	4097905	Hilarity ensues.
4098826	4117519	I personally didn't enjoy the swap to disk 2 joke because the loading to hard drive screens are more painful than swapping disks what a dang good point see you online Rob what a good point Rob brings up is that you know don't joke about the disk swapping thing and the whole this is blu-ray when the game has a freaking install good point
4119013	4120935	Actdeft Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican Actdeft
4141394	4143995	I have lots of friendly neighborhood Mexicans, actually.
4144775	4152379	First of all, congrats to your 6th anniversary, which I unfortunately missed, and a belated congrats to Rob for his birthday, which I'm getting Rob a present soon.
4152479	4152779	Thank you.
4153419	4153999	A late present.
4155880	4156861	Aw, I don't worry about it.
4156881	4157181	It's fine.
4157221	4157661	Don't worry about it.
4157801	4158121	I am!
4159762	4166445	Second, thanks to Rob for remembering me when he interviewed Tommy Tallarico and asking him if Video Games Live will return to Mexicali.
4167620	4172033	That was a pretty good interview, by the way, and it's good to hear he cares for the fans, too.
4172755	4173878	And, well, I think that's all.
4174119	4174921	Thanks, and ja.
4176089	4184155	Yeah, it was a long interview, but he's definitely passionate and he's definitely doing a lot for the video game industry.
4184175	4185115	I was kind of surprised.
4185295	4194402	I kind of thought he was a little more on the hands-off journalist reporting end, but he does a lot more hands-on than you might know at first.
4195823	4201847	Especially if you're basing your opinion of him strictly off of the Judgment Day show.
4201947	4202747	You're really missing out.
4202867	4203648	That's one thing I learned.
4204252	4207553	This email was sponsored in part by Konami, home of Never Ending Lawsuits.
4208933	4210313	This is Deftis Cabrown.
4210493	4211253	I see what she did there.
4212633	4212913	Okay.
4213574	4214094	Email!
4214254	4215414	Dun dun dun.
4215534	4216454	From Jonathan.
4217554	4223115	Dear OLR, I have been a long time listener and have been tuning into your show for a little over two years now.
4223295	4223575	Wow.
4224015	4230396	This is my first time writing to you guys and oddly enough I am typing this from the Wii internet browser since my computer practically died on me.
4230596	4231057	Wow.
4231617	4232637	Emailing from Wii?
4232857	4233357	Impressive.
4233942	4241328	My game systems have come in handy during these months and I think it is a blessing that they allow us to do more than just game.
4241788	4245652	I too, as well as many of your other listeners, use my PSP to get my weekly fix.
4246112	4250416	I don't think that you guys should do just one big show.
4250536	4257762	I mean, it could be great having it all at once, but at the same time, as Rob points out, we could have spread it out during the week.
4259382	4265025	As of late, I have found the delays of Part B to be annoying, but I understand that things happen.
4265085	4269306	I'm not fussing at Rob, but try to get it in on Thursday or Friday instead of Saturday or Saturday.
4269466	4269766	LOL.
4270267	4270867	We've addressed that.
4271267	4279530	Yeah, and hopefully, you know, I know he says he likes having it in two parts, but I think the whole split thing, Ultra Army and the whole combined thing, we'll try it out.
4279670	4281031	If the listeners don't like it, we'll change it back.
4282165	4289190	Well, anyway, I guess this should count for my FU of the week, but regarding the limited friends list on Xbox Live, I think that this is total bull.
4289530	4296055	People can't be limited to how many friends they can have to game with, and I think that should be part of the next dashboard update.
4296775	4298877	I should... No, I know all of your pro...
4300617	4302538	I know all about your problem, Rob.
4302638	4307240	I am on Loki's friends list, though, if you need to contact me.
4307560	4312102	Also, for any OLR listeners who would like to add me, my gamer tag is UnfoldedRaptor.
4312922	4315723	Jamie, I'm sorry if my email is a bit long for such a great show.
4315783	4317044	There is so much to be said.
4317244	4318745	Oh, thank you.
4319165	4321726	Keep up the great work and don't stop believing, from Jonathan.
4321846	4324387	Florida, home of the never-ending supply of dying elderly.
4328439	4328799	Nice.
4329239	4330880	That's a little bit horrible, but nice.
4331540	4333001	The last email is for me.
4333541	4333661	Aw.
4334202	4336103	Dear Jamie, I know I'm a dear.
4337523	4342765	Thank you so much for choosing Ristar, one of my favorite classic games of all time, as the classic game of the week.
4343526	4348128	I feel bad for not being present that evening, but I'm really sorry if I made you angry.
4348688	4353770	But being able to listen to it on the podcast was good enough for me and made my day, to say the least.
4357973	4379291	It is a pity that the audio wasn't working, so to make up for it and my absence, I will send a few separate emails with attached zip files that contain all of the great songs from Raystar, including my favorite Shooting Raystar and Ring Rink, which are songs that play in Act 1 of Planet Florida and Act 1 of Planet Freon.
4379651	4380632	Thanks again, Oscar.
4380772	4381152	P.S.
4381272	4381933	You win the world.
4382813	4396724	Well, sadly, I'm a little lazy to open up your files and open up the massive MP3s, but the good news is that YouTube appears to be working tonight, so here's a little bit of what you missed out on last week, if I can get a little clip here of the actual gameplay.
4396744	4407954	And if you want to hear more about this game, go listen to last week's show.
4409635	4410236	That it for email?
4411056	4411757	That be all.
4412268	4412668	All right.
4412748	4416769	If you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
4416989	4417889	Meanwhile, back to the game news.
4418370	4419310	Yes.
4420450	4423791	Well, I don't know what I should really say about this.
4424531	4425691	It's weird.
4426672	4428412	All right.
4428492	4438734	Well, anyways, Nintendo has unveiled a brand new, I guess, I don't know if it's a franchise, but game called Captain Rainbow.
4439755	4440195	And it's...
4441533	4444554	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4461101	4466462	What they've said so far is that it's filled with, like, B characters from different games.
4466822	4474924	Like, for example, in the trailer that they had on WiiFolder.com, you see Birdo in there, like, talking in Japanese and stuff.
4475344	4476724	But it's a bunch of weird characters.
4477624	4478485	So, uh... So, wait, wait.
4478585	4481525	It's a brand new IP that borrows from all the other IPs.
4481945	4482605	Sort of, yeah.
4482625	4484206	Just characters they hope you don't remember.
4484386	4489587	Yeah, and the main character is this, like, dude who turns into Captain Rainbow.
4489627	4489767	This...
4490816	4496480	Captain Rainbow Reading Rainbow Wasn't that just Mario?
4521690	4523340	no interesting
4525497	4527458	Anyhow, more franchises.
4527658	4528459	This is a good thing, though.
4528479	4530920	They're not just borrowing from all the other old games.
4531200	4532881	Capcom is starting a new one as well.
4532921	4534762	It's an Xbox Live arcade game that's coming out.
4534802	4535742	It's called Flock.
4536502	4554351	Flock is a flocking puzzle game that is, apparently, it's got to do with, like, you're in this grid-style thing, but you're a UFO, and you herd these animals, and apparently the animals have effects, and then they are, therefore, affected by certain parts and levels and the puzzle aspects.
4554911	4557432	Apparently this game is supposed to be kind of like Lemmings.
4558072	4562013	Over 50 different stages, co-op online play, and a way to edit your own levels in the game.
4562453	4562893	Should be pretty neat.
4562913	4566234	This was supposed to be their secret project that they were unveiling at E3.
4566634	4568515	It doesn't look that cool, to be honest.
4568815	4569055	Yeah?
4569775	4570475	Here's a little clip.
4570515	4574636	I know a video doesn't work that great over the radio, but at least you can hear a little of the music.
4576977	4577817	Aw, it looks cute.
4577837	4578997	They're little sheep.
4579238	4580618	They're herding everywhere with the UFO.
4580638	4580698	Oh.
4582335	4585037	It looks like a cross between Kirby Golf and Lemmings.
4590120	4591702	I'll still play the trial if nothing else.
4591762	4592342	It might be cool.
4592502	4592942	You never know.
4594023	4596145	Remember folks, Dead Rising Wii.
4598166	4599927	Because they keep saying that's not going to happen.
4600348	4600968	But we know better.
4601208	4603530	What a flocking interesting announcement.
4605171	4609014	Alright, so yeah, Flock coming soon to Xbox Live Arcade.
4609914	4611876	That sounds fascinating.
4612264	4612304	E.A.
4612344	4614225	was planning on releasing two new drum kits for Rock Band 2.
4631978	4660010	a velocity sensitive drum pad and it won't be as noisy and it will have reinforced metal pedals and clip-on cymbals and the second one is actually licensed by Ion and it's called the Ion Drum Kit it's a fairly expensive one but there are electromagnetic cymbals and adjustable pads and metal frame and this would be really sweet and expensive
4660660	4661781	That's right, you heard her right.
4662202	4666267	There are going to be add-on symbols for the rock band drums.
4666467	4668189	Hmm, interesting.
4669690	4675957	You know, if people will pay like 300, 400 bucks for those arcade-style Beatmania 2DX and pop music controllers, though, why not?
4676137	4679941	Why not pay a lot of money for these ION super-duper drum sets?
4680121	4682904	Although I don't know where the F in my house I would put them.
4683405	4683785	I want them.
4684046	4684907	Except out here in the garage.
4684927	4685327	For real?
4686068	4686668	Well, I want them.
4686748	4688030	I thought the wife hated the drums.
4688250	4688991	Well, they're at work.
4690012	4690533	Ah, I see.
4691772	4692673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4715649	4716531	Why feed children?
4716611	4718915	Unless they're going to build me a kickass drum set.
4718995	4721259	You could be playing Billy Idol in Rock Band 2.
4722554	4725736	It's a nice day for a white wedding.
4726176	4726456	Anyhow.
4727457	4729018	It's a nice day for some more gaming news, too.
4729358	4729538	Yep.
4730599	4731079	All right.
4731840	4741866	How many times have we heard this rumor that there's going to be an announcement during the Nintendo conference that's going to unveil Animal Crossing Wii?
4743067	4743487	I know.
4743847	4746729	I think, are we really going to be shocked if it gets announced?
4748012	4750274	Yes, because it's like, OMG, it's finally here.
4751135	4757660	The more the shock is, is it going to look like it's going to actually be kind of different and more interesting than the DS one?
4757680	4765066	I'm guessing they're not innovating on shit, since they didn't innovate on hardly anything from the DS and GameCube ones.
4766121	4770344	I'll still buy it because I'm a consumer whore Mr. Dream
4789571	4790492	Mike Tyson, maybe?
4791192	4791912	George Foreman?
4791993	4792553	Put him in the game.
4792573	4792973	I guess.
4793173	4794494	We need a fucking Excite Truck 2.
4794954	4796355	Fuck this Punch-Out shit.
4797596	4798116	We'll see.
4798937	4805321	The news conference is only days away, and that will confirm Animal Crossing and Punch-Out, possibly, or possibly not.
4805461	4807242	Well, here's what I'm worried about, okay?
4807262	4812025	Because Nintendo, they have a trend of following stupid ideas sometimes.
4812465	4815147	You know, with the whole Wii wheel and the Wii zapper.
4815707	4816528	It was just like...
4817625	4818526	Hey, the Wii Wheel!
4818606	4825111	People buy those stupid third-party wheels because they want to pretend that they have a steering wheel because they can't use their imagination.
4825551	4826752	Let's put one out, too!
4827212	4829574	Hey, you know, they can't imagine that it's a gun.
4829614	4830715	Let's make it look like a gun.
4830735	4834157	What are we going to have with the fucking, you know, boxing gloves or something?
4834618	4838781	I mean, seriously, there's going to be some really retarded stuff coming out, I'm sure.
4839642	4839922	Alright.
4839962	4841083	There'll be storage, dammit!
4841203	4842243	I want my storage!
4843405	4844988	You know what this show needs, you guys?
4845469	4848575	Before we wrap it up and take some calls and get out of here for the night.
4848595	4849436	You know what this show needs?
4849857	4850679	More Journey.
4854966	4857267	Welcome down the boulevard
4881693	4884674	Run, Do Not Walk, To Mame, and check this out.
4885014	4888395	Yes, it's a cheesy game, but for its time period, it was awesome.
4888655	4893456	Because the actual cabinet would play the song separate ways on tape.
4893796	4897738	When you beat the game, you were at a Journey concert, and separate ways would play on tape, and it was awesome.
4897978	4899838	And then the aliens would kidnap all their instruments again.
4900798	4901939	However, Steve Perry...
4905302	4907784	I never thought we should have done the game Rock Snob
4921584	4949061	and then you get this as if the ego wasn't big enough see it's funny because I thought that we were big already that we didn't need a video game but that's just how the world judges you like gee whiz you have a Lamborghini so you must be big I didn't understand that whatever like seriously go watch some of your own 80s music videos and yeah then come back to me come back to me and talk I still love Journey though and I still love Steve Perry even if he's a rock snob who kind of said a dumpy thing this week
4950848	4951789	and JourneyStillAwesome.
4951829	4953170	Don't let anybody tell you different.
4953370	4953950	Right, DarkSakura?
4954871	4955392	Right!
4955512	4955792	Alright.
4958014	4960416	And... And the ferret.
4960896	4961196	Alright.
4962017	4968982	Before we close out the show tonight, get to the sky plane, get some calls, we have to pay respect to our elders this week by revisiting the classics.
4969363	4977369	And we have for you guys, if Jamie doesn't drop her microphone much more, we have for you a trip down memory lane with this, the classic game of the week.
4979070	4979671	And apparently...
4981001	4984283	DarkSakura is opting for a classic of classics.
4984303	4992347	Like a just freaking, I don't want to say obvious choice, but just a choice that had to be here eventually.
4992387	4992807	Had to.
4993527	4993807	Right?
4995208	4995428	Absolutely.
4995448	4996629	So what did you pick for the kids tonight?
4996949	4997549	Chrono Trigger.
4998890	4999290	Of course.
5000430	5002431	Also, it's because Saw suggested it too.
5003192	5007254	Oh, I was going to speculate maybe it was tied into the recent announcement of the DS conversion.
5009879	5011841	I had to play the best music in the game.
5012662	5014264	This is like my favorite music in the game.
5014284	5015366	My second favorite music in the game.
5015386	5016147	Let's hear it a little louder.
5016167	5016567	What is this?
5017548	5018810	It's the old palace music.
5018930	5019371	Awesome.
5019391	5020212	Alright, go ahead.
5024053	5030638	Anyway, it was a roleplay game that came out on the Super Nintendo, Super Famicom.
5031359	5036983	It was released in Japan on March 11, 1995 and August 22, 1995 in North America.
5038444	5052274	It actually has, I think it's great they mentioned this, Square's Dream Team was behind it, which was Hironobu Sakaguchi, Kazuhiko Aoki, and Nobuo Uematsu, so that's pretty cool.
5053175	5063617	Also, the main artist behind the characters was Akira Toyama, who did the Dragon Quest series, and we better know for Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump.
5065378	5068318	Now remember, water summons wind, and wind makes fire dance.
5069999	5070599	Yes, it does.
5072879	5074540	And, um, so, uh...
5076604	5087929	A lot of the musical score though was done by Yasunori Mitsuda who actually passed on his duties to Uematsu when he fell ill.
5089029	5092851	But a lot of the way that this game played is that
5094051	5098494	It was sort of an action slash sort of turn-based RPG.
5098814	5101955	You could totally avoid some of the battles because you'd see the enemies hanging out.
5102716	5110140	But if you wanted to go into the battle, you would run up to the creatures, they would spot you, and then your battle sequence would start.
5110580	5114502	And the style is actually sort of reminding me of later on in the Evolution series.
5114542	5115163	Did you ever play that?
5116334	5117135	Evolution, and Grandia.
5133915	5157427	Um, and you would have, um, you know, everyone had hit points, they would have magical weaknesses, but the really cool thing about this, and this is actually, it was called the Active Time Battle System, which, um, actually, uh, was designed for Final Fantasy IV, which we had over here as well, um, where you have a personal timer that's based on your character speed statistic.
5158407	5178264	and you also get techs as your magic attack but the good thing about them is that you could combine your techs with other people once you you know use them enough and you would have like for example the antipode attacks it was the fire and ice attack remember that and you get different levels of those um or the uh
5179562	5181823	I just remember Frog's giant bouncing frog.
5182023	5182603	That was awesome.
5182783	5184063	The giant bouncing frog was great.
5184083	5186244	That's actually in this clip too, later on.
5186684	5188964	I mean, not in this clip, but it was in another clip.
5188985	5192245	Dude, this person played through the entire freaking game and it's all on YouTube.
5192385	5194066	Like 120 some odd parts.
5194426	5194926	It's huge.
5195566	5196647	Like 15 minutes a piece.
5197107	5197987	Ultimaga Weapon.
5200885	5211735	The other really neat example, by the way, is combining Chrono's Cyclone tech with Luka's Flame Toss to create Flame Whirl as their attack.
5212436	5219543	Also, the other cool thing is because you would guess by having Chrono in the title that it has to do with time, it did have time travel.
5220003	5223084	You could go to the same place in time.
5224324	5227325	And for a while you'd only have certain ways that you could do it.
5228065	5231286	But as you progressed, you eventually got a ship that would let you go through time.
5232086	5236647	And you would do different things through different parts of the game.
5236787	5238328	And the best thing about it was New Game+.
5239955	5250540	where you would start your game over with everything intact except for the special equipment that were part of the storyline to find, like the Masamune.
5252301	5261885	The characters in it, you had Chrono, who was like your main guy, and his was the lightning-based attack, I do believe.
5262365	5265667	And then you had Luka, you had Marle...
5268041	5276187	You also had a bonus character, which was Magus, but you can either keep him or let him go, depending on whatever you said to him.
5277628	5289997	You also had a bajillion different endings in this, and to refer to the actual... Super Nintendo version, sorry.
5290517	5293920	You actually, I do believe that you had 14 endings, I want to say?
5293940	5294020	Yeah.
5295737	5298543	So it was actually fairly sweet.
5298663	5301048	Including one where you get to hang with the developers, which is kind of cool.
5301088	5304395	That one was my favorite just because it was... Sorry about the high-pitched noise.
5304415	5306379	That's the game they're transporting right now.
5308348	5331957	but um it was just it was the game was epic and there was a PlayStation release that had I do believe an extra dungeon in it and also another ending plus it had animated cutscenes in it as far as the original release it actually did have
5337267	5342733	Some pretty interesting innovations to the cartridge itself.
5344636	5353946	There was, however, a bit of controversy that an unfinished version of the game had a ROM linked up on the internet.
5355087	5355728	Back in 95.
5357490	5359712	That had music that was not used in the game.
5360432	5362514	And a dungeon called the Singing Mountain.
5363495	5369261	And another character that... There were other sprites for characters that never were used.
5369281	5370522	I wonder if we'll see that in the DS.
5371263	5376768	Well, I do want to say that I think that that level...
5378211	5379392	was used eventually.
5380112	5383973	But I never played the PlayStation version, so don't quote me on that one.
5384254	5387195	And also, Chrono Cross was a true sequel to it.
5388936	5398200	In one of the anime cutscenes that was for Chrono Cross, it led up to Luca finding the kid for Chrono Cross.
5398600	5399420	So it was sort of interesting.
5405382	5412011	It's rumored also that Chrono Trigger is supposed to be coming on to Virtual Console.
5412151	5415956	There is going to be a DS release.
5416596	5419360	Which, in my opinion, means the Virtual Console one won't happen.
5419520	5423065	Why would they only make $15 off the Virtual Console one when they can charge $35.40 for the DS one?
5424298	5426239	Unless they're going to innovate something, but it looks so far.
5426920	5431063	The trailer is actually up at chronotrigger.jp or .co.jp.
5431083	5434245	So you can see it looks just the same.
5435246	5439089	But there was another project that I don't know if you'd ever heard of called Chrono Resurrection.
5439589	5439869	Yes.
5440370	5442391	I think we covered it on the show like a while ago.
5442451	5443532	But yeah, it looked awesome.
5443792	5452203	Yeah, and basically they were redoing the whole thing in 3D, and Squenix did release a cease and desist.
5452763	5455166	There are supposed to be ROM hacks out there, but...
5460922	5463783	As to where you can find them, if someone can find them, let me know.
5464583	5465983	There's also plenty of good music.
5466003	5471344	There's actually an acid jazz soundtrack release.
5471444	5472405	It was called Brink of Time.
5472425	5473405	It's actually really good.
5473525	5475085	I've listened to it.
5475165	5480586	There's also the play concerts had some Chrono Trigger music in it.
5480827	5482627	And, of course, there's the regular soundtrack.
5483147	5494039	and then of course you can find the there's an album called Time and Space a tribute to Yasunori Mitsuda and Chrono Symphonic which was released by Overclocked
5495799	5496019	Wow.
5496699	5497740	Lots of stuff on Chrono Trigger.
5497760	5500081	And lots of fan art and stuff.
5500241	5500801	I had a thought.
5500841	5506883	You know how the rumor was going around that the Final Fantasy XI folks are supposed to be working on a new MMO that's not Final Fantasy?
5507103	5510184	What if it was some type of Chrono Online RPG?
5510224	5511265	I bet it would work.
5511285	5512185	There's more.
5512425	5519368	The Satellaview had a release, a spin-off game called Chrono Trigger Jetpack Special, which is a minigame.
5519988	5523009	The whole racing scene that I hated in Chrono Trigger.
5523889	5524170	And then...
5525810	5527852	There was also a 16-minute OAV.
5528313	5533977	It was called Numano Monja Time and Space Adventures, which was...
5536436	5543941	I actually downloaded it today, but I watched it all on YouTube earlier, and it's very silly, but it's got some funny stuff in it.
5544001	5544861	It's actually pretty cute.
5544981	5553927	And then Radical Dreamers was like a scenario version.
5553987	5558570	It was a side story to Chrono Trigger that came out on Citella View in 1996.
5560191	5561011	So there you go.
5562172	5563733	All right, your classic game of the week.
5564687	5576493	been a long time coming, Chrono Trigger here on Orange Launch Radio for the Super Nintendo and soon to be a bunch of others, PlayStation I guess you could say and soon to be the DS who knows, maybe someday, if people get what they want, Virtual Console, there you have it
5577941	5586184	All right, now we are going to go and take your calls on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
5586224	5594466	However, quickly, before we take calls, I want to say tonight, we really want to hear your predictions for E3, especially like Wild One.
5594486	5599588	Don't name things that have already been somewhat confirmed, but what are your kind of predictions for E3 tonight?
5600628	5601488	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5601508	5601848	Who's this?
5602909	5604449	It's the one and only Raven Stolfen.
5604469	5605990	Well, hello, one and only Raven Stolfen.
5606010	5606470	How you doing?
5607350	5608271	DeadPixelLive.com
5631741	5634002	I think there might be laws against him doing that in public.
5634103	5634503	No, really.
5634963	5639546	Anything game-related you think that maybe hasn't been touched on that you think we'll see at E3?
5640306	5641147	Or that you want to see?
5642127	5642668	You know what?
5642788	5647131	I'm probably going to be the only one here, and I'm going to predict Wii Fit 2.
5648371	5648972	Wii Fit 2?
5649452	5650052	This early?
5650353	5650653	Really?
5650893	5653334	I would think if we're going to get Wii Fit 2, we'd hear about it next E3.
5653515	5654175	But that's just me.
5655862	5659065	or some expansion of Wii Fit because it's good.
5659165	5659785	Don't get me wrong.
5659845	5660586	It's really good.
5661026	5662647	But it's slim.
5662748	5664349	So they need to put something out now.
5664829	5665230	All right.
5665510	5670494	Well, what do you think though if Animal Crossing and Punch-Out are their big flagship games for the Christmas season?
5670934	5675558	Dude, Punch-Out with the balance board would be hot.
5676258	5676899	It would be kind of fun.
5679503	5682826	Blackwolf says they're going to announce when they actually put more Wii Fit on shelves.
5682886	5683807	I still can't find one.
5683847	5684288	Me neither.
5685028	5688011	I tried to look for it when I bought Civ Revolution and they didn't have it.
5688652	5688872	Sad.
5688912	5690994	I lost 20 pounds on Wii Fit.
5691374	5692235	Wow, really?
5693136	5695778	See, ever since my pancreas issues, I've lost 30 pounds.
5695818	5699121	And I'm just thinking, God, how much more could I lose if Wii Fit got in the picture, you know?
5700262	5700442	Yeah.
5700663	5701003	Crazy.
5702224	5702624	Anything else?
5702664	5704066	Any other predictions for E3 this year?
5705390	5706531	Down with corporate radio, boo.
5729345	5729845	One more thing.
5729966	5730326	Of course.
5731167	5734510	I did get the iPhone 3G and it's nice and fast.
5734870	5737653	DarkSakura, you should get Shazam for your iPhone.
5737853	5738314	Shazam?
5738494	5739194	What's Shazam?
5739795	5741637	Does it have anything to do with Captain Marvel?
5742418	5744019	It does nothing to do with Captain Marvel.
5744059	5748964	Basically, say you're listening to a song and you have no idea what it is.
5750345	5752908	The iPhone will listen to that song and tell you what it is.
5753331	5753891	That's kind of cool.
5753911	5755451	That's what some of those Verizon phones are.
5755471	5756992	Yeah, I've heard about the Verizon thing.
5757072	5757752	Oh, that's kind of neat.
5757772	5762293	Well, I've got a real obscure song that I need a title to, so I may have to hit that up.
5763273	5763693	Wait, wait, wait.
5764033	5765974	You may have a usefulness for an Apple product?
5766754	5771295	Well, I've tried those other services that listen to the song, and they can't figure it out.
5771655	5772215	Interesting.
5772575	5775416	I bet you it probably only works with well-known songs.
5775436	5775996	Yeah, I'm sure.
5776016	5776816	If this is obscure enough.
5776936	5777216	We'll see.
5777236	5777596	You never know.
5777636	5777976	You never know.
5778916	5780156	That's why there's this radio station.
5780176	5782477	The one radio station I will listen to in town.
5782917	5790302	is completely DJ-free, and it plays the music I like, which is like 90s, 80s, and today music, but it's all kind of like alternative-y.
5790642	5793785	But at the end of every song, they say the name and the artist.
5793805	5802290	There's no DJs on the network, but there's this little robotic voice that will say, for instance, today I heard Duran Duran, The Reflex, which was awesome.
5803331	5803671	Awesome.
5803771	5809555	I know, it's an awesome radio station, I gotta say, which is funny because it used to be the dentist's office music station, but now it's pretty awesome.
5809636	5810956	Anyway, any other quick thoughts?
5810996	5811317	We gotta go.
5812377	5813358	One more thing.
5813578	5814958	One more thing.
5815038	5815498	Last thing.
5816599	5820240	The remote for the iPhone to control your iTunes is great.
5820740	5822481	That one is my favorite app.
5822701	5827623	I like the application called Flashlight because I imagine you push a button and it just turns your screen white.
5827823	5828283	Flashlight.
5829023	5829823	It sure is.
5830324	5833185	I haven't tried that yet, but the iPhone is a flashlight.
5833225	5833945	You can use that.
5834125	5835345	How about an OLR app?
5835585	5837546	We need an OLR app on iPhone stat.
5839007	5839567	Are you working on it?
5840529	5854259	you are not working on it someone work on it for us and bring our text based game to iPhone we need iPhone's work iPhone's work alright we gotta let you go we want more predictions take care buddy good luck with Dead Pigs Alive hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
5855060	5861385	hey hey it's Ranma from New York you have been on the show too damn much recently but that's okay we love you how was the flight back?
5861425	5861645	good?
5863526	5869571	yeah there was a slight issue getting back but we'll save that for another time alright fair enough hey what are your predictions for E3?
5871109	5900448	I believe I told you that last week and I'll say it again Reggie Fils-Aimé will come out on stage and not just cockslap everyone with his Wii as Raven Dolphin said he will announce Star Fox with twin sticks using the Wiimote and Nunchuck I could go for that there hasn't been any Star Fox loving on the Wii I could go for that that's a realistic prediction hell yes awesome anything else what about the other systems you Nintendo fanboy what about Xbox and Sony World
5901840	5916589	Well, since they're doing this 60 gig thing, I see them coming out saying to everybody who bought a 360 in the past three months is getting a $50 rebate check and they're going to announce like 60 gig hard drives for pickup because I'm running out of space in my 360.
5917870	5920191	We have Guitar Hero and Rock Band in the house, so yeah.
5920211	5920291	What?
5938376	5938856	DarkSakura.com
5957166	5958267	Which would be my prediction.
5958307	5967852	If you ask me my prediction for E3, I do think our friends, Reggie Fils-Aimé is going to come out and address that issue and make that other guy from Europe look like the jackass he is.
5967992	5968292	I hope.
5968913	5969173	I hope.
5970174	5971394	That's plausible.
5971414	5972695	I actually believe that one more.
5972955	5974096	I will stand up and applaud.
5974176	5977318	Not that I can watch the Nintendo conference live, but I will stand up and applaud if I can.
5978298	5982000	Maybe if we're lucky, Nintendo World will make an announcement like they did a couple years ago.
5982040	5985062	They'll be doing a live feed of the press conference.
5985593	6006359	look around on the internet, internet sites are doing it this year and I believe G4 is doing it again and supposedly learned their lesson about the commercial interruptions but honestly why watch it on G4, you can watch it on the internet probably be a lot I'm going to be stuck at work so I'm going to need some type of RSS feed I can guarantee that the Microsoft press conference will be on Xbox.com and it'll probably be on Microsoft's site they normally feed those
6006539	6015022	I want to say, if I remember right, and I apologize if I'm misappropriating this because I'm going to be talking about someone else's show, but I watch Twitter and I follow other podcasters on Twitter.
6015042	6020843	I want to say Gamertag Radio is running the Xbox conference, of course, because, you know, Gamertag, hello.
6021403	6025345	But I think they're running the Nintendo one, too, on their site, so check it.
6025625	6026005	Awesome.
6026205	6027325	I might definitely do that.
6027725	6027885	Yep.
6028726	6029126	All righty.
6029146	6029786	Well, we're going to let you go.
6029806	6031126	We've got to get more prediction calls, okay?
6031587	6031767	Cool.
6031807	6032227	No problem.
6032267	6032547	Later, guys.
6032567	6032767	All right.
6032807	6033167	Take care, buddy.
6033187	6033687	Bye, Jamie.
6033707	6033987	Bye.
6035148	6035308	What?
6035328	6036008	No bye for Matt?
6037386	6037727	Whatever.
6039850	6040611	I love you, Loki.
6040651	6041212	You're alright, man.
6041232	6041873	Alright, bye.
6041933	6042955	Take care, Ranma.
6043015	6045579	That was pretty good, I gotta say.
6045959	6047021	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6047041	6047382	Who's this?
6048924	6049405	Hi, this is
6050836	6052217	Hey, you're dropping out there a little bit, bud.
6052257	6055578	Make sure you got everything else shut off on your internets.
6056038	6056399	That's right.
6056419	6057759	I've been having problems lately.
6057959	6058540	All right.
6058600	6059080	Give it a try.
6059140	6061501	Quickly, what are your predictions for this year's E3?
6061721	6062621	Identify yourself, too.
6062741	6063122	Who are you?
6063682	6064582	Oh, I'm sorry.
6064702	6066063	I forgot to say Gold Banjo.
6066203	6066963	Well, hello, Gold Banjo.
6066983	6068184	What are you predicting for E3 this year?
6068641	6069842	Okay.
6070763	6075989	Well, I'm hoping for maybe an F-Zero Wii, but I don't know if it'll happen.
6076169	6086519	That is a mighty fine prediction, and it may be a little bit fanboyish, but I'm with you on that, because I still will play F-Zero on the GameCube, F-Zero GX.
6086820	6088762	I love F-Zero.
6089763	6091204	That is one of my favorite racing series.
6091304	6091785	I love it.
6093835	6097638	And what Ranma said, I guess I'm hoping for that too.
6097658	6103843	All the predictions so far are pretty good, so I don't know how many of them we'll see, but I'm excited about it.
6104004	6106266	GS68 in chat says F-Zero is a dead series.
6106406	6107667	I hope to hell you're wrong.
6107887	6109809	I hope you're wrong, because I don't know about you, Loki.
6109849	6110970	Aren't you a big F-Zero fan too?
6111450	6114593	I love... That was only the last one, and it was alright.
6114613	6120338	The problem with the arcade one, the only problem I had with the arcade one was the fact that it had like six tracks.
6120638	6125120	But my god, the GameCube and the way it linked together was awesome.
6125901	6128982	Oh man, I just... The only problem was finding an arcade cabinet.
6130143	6130443	Is what?
6132124	6133485	Finding an arcade cabinet.
6133685	6135025	Yeah, yeah, true, true.
6136046	6137347	Well, any other quick predictions?
6137427	6139848	A lot of our callers are jumping right to Nintendo.
6139868	6141929	What about Microsoft and Sony camps?
6141969	6142729	Anything you got there?
6144851	6146251	I don't have a PS3 or a 360.
6147792	6148392	So who cares?
6148673	6149333	Fuck them, right?
6150290	6153336	Yeah, one more thing about the F-Zero thing.
6153477	6155360	Sure, sure.
6155460	6157545	You know the F-Zero expansion pack, right?
6157565	6159088	For that cancelled add-on for the N64?
6159108	6159649	Oh, right, huh?
6162427	6168589	They had a car and track editor, but yet they never added that into GX when it came out.
6169870	6171751	I would hope that they would add that for the Wii.
6172171	6175652	Maybe some track and car sharing and stuff.
6175692	6176472	That would be awesome.
6176932	6177733	That would be pretty cool.
6178273	6180494	I'm going to go play some Xero GameCube tonight.
6181935	6184937	I got my GameCube controller for Mega Man.
6184957	6187238	I got a new memory card for the Mega Man game when I bought it.
6187258	6189539	Now I'm itching to play some F-Zero.
6189579	6190179	So thanks a lot.
6191380	6191800	That's all good.
6192941	6193181	Alright.
6194541	6195342	We gotta let you go, buddy.
6195542	6196783	Take care and happy E3.
6196803	6197043	Yep.
6198103	6198884	You too.
6198904	6199124	Bye.
6199224	6199524	Bye-bye.
6199884	6203406	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
6203466	6204366	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6204386	6204727	Who's this?
6206147	6206968	Hey, this is ActDeft.
6207148	6207708	Hey, ActDeft.
6207748	6209109	I love your icon on Skype.
6209149	6210589	By the way, it's a little Kirby chef.
6210710	6211370	It's awesome.
6213191	6213551	Yeah, definitely.
6213571	6213671	Yeah.
6213691	6213932	I have two.
6213952	6214972	One Nintendo-related, another Sony one.
6215092	6218434	Okay, my Sony one is Sniper 4 for the PlayStation 3.
6218475	6219155	Or maybe a PSP game.
6219175	6219635	A what for the PS3?
6241537	6242237	Sly Cooper.
6243338	6243918	Oh, okay.
6244378	6244938	Sly Cooper.
6245158	6246399	Cool, okay.
6247239	6249080	So some game announcements, that's good.
6249500	6252601	I definitely hope that it's going to be announced, though.
6253241	6254301	It's a far shot.
6254922	6256402	Any reason why you're going for Sly Cooper?
6257663	6263205	Well, maybe because I'm a fan of the series.
6264005	6267366	So I really hope that this time it's going to be announced.
6267822	6270967	No reason you can't have a little fanboyism in your predictions.
6270987	6271708	What about Nintendo?
6273951	6277255	A new Kirby game for the Wii.
6277456	6279058	So your icon's not just a clever icon.
6279078	6283404	Yeah, a Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool, although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately.
6285768	6293194	Well, the Kirby franchise needs a new, definitely new game, like a lift-off.
6293594	6298938	That Kirby drawing game on the DS might be kind of fun on the Wii.
6298978	6300279	I actually like that game quite a bit.
6300339	6303181	I don't remember, Touch All-Stars, I like that game, it was fun.
6303541	6312388	Yeah, one of my predictions on the forums for this year was going to be a port or a new game using that same gameplay.
6313007	6316808	So I hope Nintendo announces this E3.
6317228	6318029	Alright, we'll see.
6318129	6320269	Actdeft, any other quick last thoughts before we get to some more predictions?
6322650	6325591	No, just thanks on the question for Tomotaro Riko.
6326531	6327412	Hey, no problem.
6328332	6329852	This show is not just about the three of us.
6329912	6330693	It's about the listeners.
6330893	6334674	So when we can ask questions that we know our listeners will want to hear, we ask them.
6336715	6337035	Thanks.
6337055	6337735	Alright, take care, buddy.
6339995	6341516	I hope it does get back to them, by the way.
6341576	6344638	I think this will be our last call, then we're going to call it a night because we're running pretty long.
6344678	6345799	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6345819	6346119	Who's this?
6346919	6347620	GS68.
6347740	6348220	Well, hello.
6348260	6348921	You got through.
6349121	6350782	What's your predictions for E3, buddy?
6352623	6362269	The boys of Calamity and Harmonix duke it out over the whole Rock Battle lawsuit, and it's a myth that an arcade game gets announced at E3 and the whole universe dies.
6362719	6370748	So are you suggesting that Konami should bring back their Rumble Roses models from a few E3s ago and they can duke it out in Cream Corn or Jell-O Wrestling?
6371519	6372800	No, I was joking.
6374201	6374581	I wasn't.
6374641	6387628	Maybe, like you and some of the cars have said, maybe Nintendo will address the storage space to some sort of attachment to the Wii that plugs into the USB drive or something.
6387648	6392291	Yeah, just a patch that they could release overnight that'll let the USB drives work.
6392331	6393071	I don't know, call it a hunch.
6394508	6398691	Also, freaking Super Mario RPG gets it released on Virtual Console.
6399532	6401533	Ah, now there's a good fanboy prediction.
6401573	6403275	Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console.
6403295	6404316	We know it's coming eventually, right?
6404336	6405376	We heard the Japanese one.
6405737	6409299	So you would think if it's coming out in Japan, it's got to come out here eventually.
6409439	6409880	So we'll see.
6410961	6412202	Yeah.
6412262	6413142	Any other predictions, sir?
6416185	6417886	What about the Sony and Microsoft end of things?
6419981	6426585	Well, I don't really know because the only next-gen console I have is a Wii.
6426605	6431247	I don't feel like selling a lot of money for a 360 or PS3 at the moment.
6431908	6435590	How about, okay, I'll give you a fanboy one because I would love to see this someday.
6435630	6443874	How about a company announces in partnership with either Microsoft or Sony a localized version of WANGAM Midnight Maximum Tune for consoles?
6445335	6445815	No, I...
6447586	6452428	I don't know, that game seems like the kind of game that I'd rather play in arcades.
6452788	6456149	The PS3 version of Wind Game Midnight sucks balls.
6456169	6457190	Because it's a different thing.
6457330	6459191	It's not related to the actual arcade series.
6459511	6466553	That game's based on... It is based off the arcade series, but the problem is it's a port of a PlayStation 1 game, I think.
6467974	6473096	Well, because it's based off... It and the original Wind Game Midnight arcade game were...
6473806	6477889	based on Tokyo Extreme Racer for the PS2 or Dreamcast.
6479230	6481212	So the magic just belongs in the arcades.
6481472	6482393	It doesn't need to be brought home.
6483153	6486676	Yeah, some things in the arc... I mean, that's what the arcade needs.
6486816	6489919	More things that you can only experience in the arcade.
6489999	6496044	I mean, these days you can just easily port shmups and fighters to the consoles and PCs.
6496864	6497325	Fair enough.
6497365	6498145	I'll give you that, sir.
6498505	6500767	Alright, we're going to wrap it up, GS68, but thanks for the call.
6500787	6501368	Have a good one, okay?
6502008	6502328	You too.
6502429	6502849	Alright, later.
6504042	6505724	We will see what happens at E3.
6505784	6507185	It all starts this week.
6507686	6508367	It's going to be awesome.
6509468	6513212	In the meantime though, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up the show tonight.
6513492	6515014	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
6517476	6519058	Think for yourself and learn to be offended.
6521043	6523344	My final thought is I want a Hot Pocket.
6523884	6524144	Loki?
6524584	6527064	My final thought is I have a bunch of last-minute stories.
6527424	6528585	Oh, yeah, we never get to last-minute stories.
6528625	6528905	I'm sorry.
6528925	6530065	All right, last-minute stories then.
6530345	6531205	Okay, real quick.
6532365	6534626	Madden Soundtracks coming to Rock Band's download content.
6534666	6535446	I guess that's kind of cool.
6535546	6536746	Did I leave that off the show roll?
6536766	6537126	My bad.
6537406	6537606	Yeah.
6538147	6538547	I'm a dummy.
6538667	6538887	All right.
6539907	6548929	Onichanbara, that game with the chick in lingerie and a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword, is coming to the Wii in the U.S.
6549009	6549229	now.
6549949	6552492	Fuck yeah, that's awesome.
6553132	6556176	Here's one of my predictions to come out of V3.
6556556	6567268	That there's going to be a software patch for the Wii that will allow you to use the Wii Classic controller or perhaps this brand new trademark patented controller that Nintendo will be putting out.
6567968	6568048	Um...
6568649	6569129	GameCube Controllers
6590666	6593587	That's supposedly going to debut on Xbox Live Arcade tomorrow.
6594947	6600069	There's also a rumor that they're going to surprise us with Geometry Wars Retrovolve 2.
6601450	6603270	That might be the surprise thing tomorrow.
6604070	6611513	There are a couple other games that they mentioned as well, including... I don't know where to go here.
6613976	6618038	There was some other crosswords game that's going to be coming out.
6618638	6620599	Which, I don't know, that didn't look too exciting at all.
6620619	6621540	They did announce that, though.
6621580	6622400	That's really happening.
6622660	6623921	Yeah, that's really happening.
6624661	6628123	And there was also some other game.
6628743	6629724	A shooter game.
6629944	6631705	Shred Nebula.
6632345	6639048	Dude, I would not want to be crappy crosswords game in the week that Duke Nukem or Geometry Wars 2 or these other rumored things get released.
6639548	6640109	Exactly.
6640789	6640869	Um...
6642136	6644359	There's one thing I do know.
6644879	6649645	There was an article this week about Blazing Lizard.
6650285	6653429	I guess they're being represented by Flashman Studios.
6653469	6660958	You may not know who Blazing Lizard is, but they're the ones behind Pirates vs. Ninja Dodgeball on Xbox Live Arcade.
6662026	6664127	and they have an unannounced title for the Wii.
6665027	6669948	I know what that game is by chance and it actually is Pirates vs. Ninja Dodgeball.
6670388	6673389	It's coming to the Wii now too.
6674569	6675189	Let's see.
6676029	6679030	There's a pretty cool game coming out called I Heart Geeks.
6679430	6683891	It's a rude Goldberg puzzle game kind of like in The Incredible Machine.
6683911	6684951	It's kind of neat.
6686082	6701709	and apparently there are some leaks out of Sony's support site about upcoming titles including Punisher Warzone for the PS3 and Maxim Pinball, Cinnamon Beats, Alien Sports Minigolf, and Under Fire.
6702730	6703510	Kind of interesting.
6704231	6706452	There's going to be a new Wolfenstein game at E3 this year.
6706572	6710594	In fact, that's already in the new Game Informer magazine, so check that out.
6710674	6711074	It's pretty cool.
6712305	6723377	and also rumored that Rock Band 2 setlist includes Guns N' Roses and the Chinese Democracy Trek.
6725839	6728141	That would be a pretty awesome little surprise.
6729102	6730144	That could be very interesting.
6731225	6734468	And that's all I really want to talk about right now.
6735502	6735883	All right.
6736664	6737666	Well, oh, oh, I'm sorry.
6737766	6738187	One more thing.
6738207	6738427	Sorry.
6738447	6738608	Sorry.
6738928	6740230	This is completely Raven's Dolphin.
6740310	6740571	Sorry.
6740611	6746020	This is completely random, but I saw there was this list that was on game trailers.
6746361	6748785	It's eight extremely embarrassing E3 moments.
6749375	6752598	And the one that they have in the very beginning on here is Jamie Kennedy.
6752878	6759263	Remember his Activision little spiel last year was completely embarrassing and he wasn't very funny.
6759283	6761384	I actually met Jamie Kennedy this Wednesday.
6761625	6763166	I have a picture with him, actually.
6763226	6764427	It's pretty crappy.
6764567	6766648	And I have a new autograph for our autograph wall.
6766949	6767369	Hooray.
6767389	6768070	I don't know.
6768350	6769451	He's actually pretty funny in person.
6769511	6772753	I need to put the Freeze Pop autograph up, by the way, that Ranma got me for my birthday.
6773654	6774995	And I'm digging that new Freeze Pop album.
6775375	6776076	Actually, it's pretty fun.
6776656	6776976	Good times.
6777757	6778938	Alright, your final thought, Loki.
6779658	6783560	My final thought is I hopefully will finish OLR PSP this week.
6784160	6786802	I know my wife is really hating that I'm working on this.
6787822	6790564	Did you want to change your final thought, DarkSakura, since it's been so long?
6790864	6791024	No.
6791404	6795506	Alright, and I will agree with GameGuru on a last final thought.
6795986	6796587	E3 better rock.
6797543	6799845	I agree, especially since we're not there to party away.
6818564	6821727	Until next time, we'll be back next week with all of the E3 news.
6822187	6826371	And if anything especially strikes us, we may go live midweek.
6826451	6826932	We'll see.
6827072	6830435	Not live, but a tape thing because we can't invade other all-game show space.
6830475	6831896	But maybe something midweek.
6831996	6832377	We'll see.
6832977	6834659	In the meantime, I'm Rob Roberts.
6835339	6836020	She's DarkSakura.
6836060	6836520	He's Loki.
6836981	6837842	And this is Orange Launch Radio.
