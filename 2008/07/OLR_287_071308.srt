Tonight, July 13th, 2008

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A major lawsuit happens in the music game world

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mega Man 9 is set to go multi-platform

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And we take calls on your predictions for this year's E3

Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
My name is Rob Roberts and join me as always

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yo

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How you doing, Jamie?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Warm

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Warm, yeah, it's not quite as horrid, the temperature this week

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But we still are combating some issues here in California

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Not just the heat, but the smoke was terrible

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Like Wednesday or Thursday, oh my gosh

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am making use of Consumer Reports

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It was like a volcano erupted, how's that?

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
To look for air conditioners

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, hooray

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Another idea I have is an evaporative air cooler

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Nice, now we have a little ghetto set up today that's working fairly decent

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Because I'm a genius

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But thank god it's not 103 like last week

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I think this week it's 93, so hot, but not scorching hot

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Also hot every week, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, I am, I run very hot

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
How are you doing?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It looks like you shaved your head almost completely

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, because I was hot

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And because I didn't want to comb my hair anymore

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It gets to the point where it's like, okay, I can't do anything with this

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I'm gonna have to shave it off

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Alright, we're about to get into how is your gaming week

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But first, just a quick little note about tonight's show

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There's no Justin TV tonight because our video camera's out

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So we do not have Justin TV feed tonight

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sorry guys, but at least it's a radio show, not a video show

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And the other thing is that there's only going to be a part A this week

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There's not going to be a part A and part B

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's partially due to the heat, also partially due to the fact that E3

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The madness for E3 starts tomorrow

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So it kind of defeats the purpose of uploading a show mid-week

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because everything will be outdated

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're going to try and have something up on the feed mid-week

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It just depends if we can all get together at once

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We'll see, so more to come on that

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But for now, we're only going to have one big show for you guys here

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But all the segments you know and love

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Classic gaming of the week, mailbag, all that good stuff

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And your calls

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And tonight, they're talking about fire

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Act Def says the show is on fire

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Frisbee says my hair is on fire

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There you have it, everybody's on fire

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're all flaming tonight in chat at Orange Lounge Radio

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think I've made a decision

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What's that?

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What might best suit our needs

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The cooler?

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A swamp cooler

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Excellent, yeah, actually my work

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And it's cheaper than a portable air conditioning unit

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Alright

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Be more cost effective

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is economics on Orange Lounge Radio

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Save money, use less energy

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Alright, let's talk about all the money you blew games on this week

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And how was your gaming week?

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I played DDR

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Really?

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I played the supernova machine at the movie theater

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And I wanted to die

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I was wearing my sandals

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So first of all I didn't have the right shoes

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And then I tried to do shit that was way too hard

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But at least you got up there and played

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, sorta

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I know if I play I am way, way out of practice

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So that's my issue

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Although I want to try a supernova 2 machine someday

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I dusted off my Super Nintendo cartridge

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Of something that I will be speaking of later in the show

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Awesome

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
How about now, you are an iPhone user

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, I did download some iPhone games

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You got the new 2.0 firmware for your existing iPhone, right?

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, I did

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay, gotcha

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And let me give the name of the game real quick

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I haven't played a whole lot of it

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But it's a free game for everyone who has an iPhone or an iPod touch

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And it's called Aurora Faint

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It basically plays like Bejeweled

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But you have a leveling system in it

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So it's pretty cool

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Like Puzzle Quest-ish, kinda?

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Mmm, yeah

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I also downloaded the Stalker program

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What, pray tell, is the Stalker program?

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Whirl

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How does that work?

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's like, for everyone who's got it

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It keeps track of like restaurants and places you like to go

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So that you know where your friends like to hang out

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That is kinda scary

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What a world we're living in

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What do you think, though, about this whole, you know, application thing on the new iPhone?

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You know, the fact that people can create their own games and applications and all this stuff

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
God damn time

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You think it's kinda what's gonna put the iPhone really out there, but make it kinda the must-have thing?

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sorta

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's still a lot of people

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It was already the must-have thing

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There's still a lot of people that are very anti-iPhone

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, sucks to be them

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I think we have one sitting here in the studio

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sucks to be them, more for me

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm anti-Apple, but that, you know, does fall under the same umbrella

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Do you think, though, do you think another company will try to, you know, cause I notice like, what is that other phone?

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The Instinct is supposed to work a lot like the iPhone

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can tell you now the LG one is shit

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I look at that and I go, it's not gonna really be able to penetrate the marketplace the way that Apple has, I don't think

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's just my personal thought

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What's gonna help Apple is marketing to other providers

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll tell you what else is cool

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was hearing a little bit about it on Bobby's show

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know much about this, but apparently there's some type of program you can get

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Some app you can get that you can listen to internet radio through that Edge network

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So you can listen to All Games Radio or our show anywhere you go

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
People have it hooked up so that if you have one of those systems where you can play your iPod through the car

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You could listen to All Games Radio, like it's a car

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I almost downloaded it, but I have to move off my photos before I put more apps on there

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The stuff that I downloaded so far, let me grab my phone and take a look real quick

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Blah

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Live radio, she's literally opening up the phone

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I downloaded AIM, Aurora, Thaint, Twitterrific, Whirl, and Epocrates prescription

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because Epocrates is actually kind of a cool little program

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That if you have, say that you find an unidentified pill and you want to know what it is

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Then you can enter in the pill's description including serial numbers that are on the pill

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Wow

149
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And it'll look it up and show you a picture of it so you can compare it

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And you know, if I take this, will I hallucinate?

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Bobby spoke up in chat, he says it's called Tuner, is the name of the program you're going to want to check out

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think I'll download it right now

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Awesome, it might have a cost, I'm not sure

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's see, comments from chat

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Robert M, my iTunes is showing the applications menu in place of games

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have the iPod fifth generation video though

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Same thing happened to me, I have Pagle and some of the other games they've released for iPod

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And they now are applications that run on your iPod

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And sadly they don't have a lot of them, but that's what happened to the old games

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I hope they do put out some other useful things for those of us that haven't gotten on board the iPhone thing yet

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think I will at some point, I'm just waiting for the craziness around the iPhone to die down

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Gerardo speaks up though and says I don't see anything innovative in my phone and then hides

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, I checked out Tuner and Tuner is $5

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
$4.99 to be specific

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Whatever, it's $5

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So I'm gonna get it after I have money

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I downloaded a bunch of free shit though and it was really cool

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now I can look up drugs at work

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And AIM, I can use AIM at work

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Free is awesome

171
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hells yeah

172
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Unless it's yours

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It was full of hamburger

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, because I'm eating a hamburger, that's why

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Of course

177
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That is not just a hamburger, that is a bacon and cheese I see in there

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Double bacon cheeseburger

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh my god, an artery killer right there

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well it's because, I don't know, fast food hamburgers are pretty tiny

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So if you get a hamburger it's like a cracker

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Gotcha

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So this is two crackers and, I don't know, bacon

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
By the way Jamie, Bobby is recommending Tap Tap Revenge and says it's free

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I saw it and I looked at it but I don't think I would play it that much

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Free Jamie, free

187
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well if it's free then you gotta play it

188
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like Yaris, you gotta try Yaris at least once

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I also though I'm trying to be conservative for space because I really do like to take a lot of useless pictures with my phone

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That she does, I can attest to that

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We'll go out to Indian Food and she takes pictures of the food

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And my beer

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
She takes pictures of his eating, her beer

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Anyway, sorry, Loki, your gaming week

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's right

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Grand Theft Auto IV, that was pretty much it

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I've been busy and we'll get into that

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We'll get into that in a little while

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But Grand Theft Auto is still fun, still a lot of people playing it

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's still fun, well I haven't, we've just been playing the work games

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You know, so we do our four player deathmatch because the fifth machine is still broken

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What makes the replayability of that game so awesome?

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Just, well like the new thing that we're doing now is we've changed the settings a little bit

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So that the only blip that shows up on the radar is whoever is in first

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And everyone else is invisible

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So you're running around and whoever is in the lead, you can find them but the other players you can't find

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So the person in the lead doesn't see like people like bearing down on them in cars and stuff like that

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So it makes it really intense actually because everyone is kind of going after the leader at the same time

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Nice

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Comments from Chatroom, we have NameAndLights says I'm using Tuner on iTouch

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So that's that iPod that's not quite, it's the iPhone without the phone

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The iTouch which also got the upgrade to use all the apps

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's pretty cool

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's see, other comments from Chat

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Shaoran said there used to be a double bacon with a really long name that a friend of mine called a Satanburger

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't know

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We're turning into Orange Launch Foodio

218
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Alright, so Grand Theft Auto 4 was Loki's game of the week

219
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah, pretty much

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We'll get to the rest of it in a little bit

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Myself, I also have not been playing a lot of new stuff, kind of the same old stuff, you know, Raiding and WoW

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Guitar Hero 2, I went back and played Guitar Hero 2 this week in Guitar Hero 3

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And I think I talked about this a couple of weeks ago

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm finally learning with my fingers how to hit those notes without necessarily strumming

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Like the difference between the notes that you don't have to strum if you get the note before it

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't remember what exactly they call that, I'm sure somebody in chat will correct me, but the whole

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hammer ons

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Is that a hammer ons? Yeah, I'm finally learning how to do that

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know that either

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Hell, I'm still playing three keys, okay?

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, I was able to go back to Guitar Hero 2 and 3

232
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I actually beat the Living Color song in Guitar Hero 3

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I five started my first cult of personality

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I five started my first time on hard, not expert, I'm not quite there yet

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But for me, that was a freaking accomplishment

236
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I was so excited because that song was not easy

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I was excited when I beat that freaking Slipknot song

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That has the impossible introduction, that was tough

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You have to learn hammer ons to get past that

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I was going to say, I also, this week, it's not gaming related

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But I kept, just even watching the trailers for it

242
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And then after watching the movie, I think it would make an awesome game

243
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Wanted

244
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Just because, I mean, you know the whole curving bullets thing in there

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The way they kind of like swing their gun out or whatever

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You could totally do that with a Wii remote or something

247
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't understand why anyone hasn't come up with this idea

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
To make this movie into a game

249
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Because it would be pretty awesome

250
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But The Matrix was supposed to be an awesome game too

251
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Listen, okay

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
After watching this movie, you're just like

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Why the fuck did this guy not direct The Matrix?

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Because, I swear to God, if he directed the sequels

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We wouldn't have an issue

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There would be like 50 sequels to this damn movie

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Because it's seriously so much better

258
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's the Russian guy who did Nightwatch and Daywatch

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I know, I used to hold The Matrix pretty high up there for action

260
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's borderline, I mean, Keanu Reeves kind of brings it down there

261
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But action-wise it was pretty kick-ass

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But, oh my God, Wanted is so much better

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Sub-Z in chat says, curved bullet is so unrealistic

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But that's the point, right?

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's the point

266
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't go in there expecting a realistic espionage film

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Exactly, I mean, there's a guy that freakin'

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Basically these assassins or whatever

269
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Have the ability to control adrenaline really well

270
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
To the point where they can do superhuman things

271
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's the whole premise of this

272
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's a superhero film

273
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Sort of, it's not really that superhuman

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But Matrix stuff, where they can slow down time

275
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Their perspective of it, super strength and stuff like that

276
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Here's my other quick questions about Wanted

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And then we'll go back to games from movies

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Are there tits in the movie?

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No tits?

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No tits

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Any drug usage?

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There's lots of blood, lots of killing

284
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So it's just fine, because I'm looking for the trifecta of sex, drugs, and violence

285
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's no tits, so you don't have sex

286
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
There's no drugs, it sounds like?

287
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
There's a good twist in the plot, a good twist

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That you don't see coming

289
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's a twist

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What a twist

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You can have Nookie without boobs, Rob

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Well, I guess that's true

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But, you know, still

294
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Do you watch that episode of Buffy?

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Look, I'm surprised Angelina Jolie is in a movie and not showing her tits

296
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That's all

297
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, you see her entire backside

298
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay, so there's a little sex, a little sex

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sexual

300
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Anyway

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We have T and A minus T

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Just A

303
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Alright

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And yeah, it's supposed to be unrealistic, but it's not

305
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's basically, it's kind of like The Matrix

306
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Where it's sort of grounded in

307
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay, I want to say it's really grounded in the real world

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But it takes place in a world that could sort of be realistic

309
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And then there's people doing unrealistic things in it

310
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's sort of like that, but it's not like as ridiculous and ridiculous as

311
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But, I mean, a lot of video games are ridiculous

312
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Like that, right?

313
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You know, they take place in sometimes the real world

314
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Or a world like this one

315
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's not like you go into it and go

316
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Man, this is completely retarded, like the transporter or something like that

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is, you know

318
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't know, it's just really cool stuff

319
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's all I got to say

320
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Awesome

321
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Definitely go see it, it's awesome

322
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'd totally watch it again

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Back to video games, I want to talk about a new game I played this week

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I went out and bought Civilization Revolution

325
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I talked about the demo a few weeks ago on the show

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I was pretty crazy about the demo

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I went about the full game, I'm not disappointed

328
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
As a Civilization fan on the PC, I am not disappointed

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's not as in-depth as the version on the PC

330
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's very much simplified

331
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But I think it works great for a console

332
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I mean, I ran through a full game

333
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Granted on the easiest difficulty

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Because I'm still trying to get my feet wet with how to play the game again

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But it only took me between an hour and an hour and a half

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
To get a total domination victory over my opponents in the game

337
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The only kind of little bitch I have in the game that I think would get to me

338
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If I was coming from the PC to the console

339
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I think you've probably heard this a lot of other places and it's true

340
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You don't get to customize your game a lot

341
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Like in Civ 4, you can customize the world you're playing on

342
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And when you start and how the world looks and the size

343
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You can customize all that stuff in advance

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
In Civ Revolution, you already kind of start with one city built

345
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And that's it, you don't get to customize a whole lot of that

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So I'm hoping though maybe with some download stuff later on

347
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
2K and Firaxis can remedy that

348
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But it's a minor bitch in the scope of things

349
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Because I think the game is still pretty cool

350
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm a little surprised it's not on the arcade

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There's not a lot that they're doing in this game

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That requires, I would think, the usage of a DVD

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I would think it's a game they could have put out on the arcade for a lot cheaper

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So I think the price is probably one of the only sticking points

355
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Because $60 is quite a bit

356
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But it is a hell of a game with replayability value

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And it's something you can play multiplayer

358
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Although I personally have not done that myself yet

359
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I get on and play multiplayer

360
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I think it's one of those games where it's never quite the same game twice

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And there's many different ways to accomplish the goal

362
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Many different civilizations you can play

363
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I do recommend it, especially if you're a fan of it on the PC

364
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And you want to kind of check it out

365
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But just know you're not getting a port of Civ 4

366
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're getting a whole new Civ-like game

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's dumbed down slightly for consoles

368
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But sometimes dumbed down can be a good thing

369
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah, Prowler says in chat there, Simplified can be a good thing

370
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And Rama says in chat, Rob is a Civ fanboy, of course he's gonna love it

371
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, yeah

372
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't know if I'd say I love it

373
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Like I love the original Civilization

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I love Civ 4

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But I like it a lot

376
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So far

377
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So we'll see about that

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Again, just to kind of put it out there

380
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We are only doing a part A tonight

381
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And that has to do with the whole E3

382
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And things being outdated

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
However, I have some good news

384
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Now we're not bitter at all about not being able to go to E3

385
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I mean, no one invited us to the cool kids party

386
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
We're not bitter at all about not being able to go

387
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, it's great

388
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
My work got an invite, but they didn't go

389
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's like, oh, we don't want to take it

390
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I haven't been interested in going since they changed it

391
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Although I hear there's no lines in any of that stuff anymore

392
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I would just want to go to hang out with the cool kids

393
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But apparently we are not part of that clique

394
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But the hell with them

395
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The hell with them

396
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We are starting E3 right now

397
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We're starting E3 right now

398
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
E3 begins right now on this very radio show that you are listening to

399
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
With our very own

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
OLR E3 press conference

401
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And you're all invited

402
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Alright, and we have our own E3 surprises in store for you tonight

403
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So the official OLR E3 press conference

404
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Blah, blah, blah

405
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We've had wonderful support from all of our listeners

406
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Over the past six years of our existence

407
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Blah, blah, blah

408
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Our show is still making no money at all

409
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But it's sure fun to listen to and do

410
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Blah, blah, blah

411
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay, let's get to the good stuff

412
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We have three announcements tonight that will change our show a little bit

413
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
For the future

414
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Now one of these you have probably heard about a little bit

415
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But we're just kind of confirming it on our own program tonight

416
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And that is that we are going to PAX

417
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Penny Arcade Expos

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
If E3 won't have us

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Then F you

420
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
We're going to go to Penny Arcade Expo

421
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I think that's funny because isn't that also Latin for peace?

422
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm not sure

423
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I didn't do research before tonight's press conference

424
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But we'll say yes for now

425
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But here's the thing

426
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It gets better

427
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Now sadly Loki is not going to PAX because of the wife

428
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But you know things happen

429
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But myself and Dark Sakura are going to PAX

430
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But it gets better

431
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Not only are we going to PAX

432
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We are going to be on the floor

433
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Actually broadcasting live radio

434
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's a partnership thing that we're doing with All Games Radio

435
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
They're actually going to be set up there

436
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Out there on the floor with like bean bags around

437
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's something called the Sumo Lounge

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I myself have not been to PAX

439
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't know what this is

440
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But it's going to be near the tabletop gaming and the press room area

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
They're going to have the Sumo Lounge with bean bags

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And we're actually going to be broadcasting from the show

443
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Friday, Saturday, Sunday

444
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's 3 hours on Friday starting at 4 Pacific

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
3 hours on Saturday starting at 4 Pacific

446
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And 2 hours on Sunday starting at 4 Pacific as well

447
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The whole thing is going to be moderated by Bobby Blackwolf

448
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Our buddy that precedes us here on Orange Lounge Radio

449
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We will be a part of that

450
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
We'll be kind of on and off of there

451
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We might do our own podcast from the site to supplement it

452
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But we'll be live as a part of this on All Games Radio

453
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's not just us

454
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
DMN, your old pal from our network as well as Understation Live

455
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
He's going to be there

456
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Bobby's there

457
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Super happy fun time show

458
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Dead Pixel Live

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Electric Sisterhood

460
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Game Addict Hotline

461
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Shatterbox

462
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Evil Avatar

463
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
All there, all represented at Penny Arcade Expo

464
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It is the freaking Voltron of independent podcasting

465
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Live

466
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
August 29th, 30th, and 31st in Seattle

467
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And if you can't be there in person you can still listen to the madness on

468
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
AllGames.com

469
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's going to be awesome

470
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Bobby would like to clarify it is not in the exhibit hall

471
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But it's still within the convention center

472
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So there it is

473
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And the OLR PAX broadcast will also be podcasted

474
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Bobby will let you know when our segment is

475
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That we're going to be on it

476
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And it's apparently going to be its own special podcast

477
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So stay tuned to AllGames.com for more information on that

478
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Second announcement

479
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You asked for it, you got it

480
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We're going to do it

481
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I know that part B has been very delayed lately

482
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Throughout the week in getting pushed to the podcast feed

483
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So we're going to try something new

484
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't say that OLR doesn't listen to the listeners

485
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Starting with next week's show

486
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Part A and B will be released as one giant show

487
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Parts A and B combined into one giant show

488
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And we will have something that kind of even runs in between the shows

489
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
When you're listening to them on the podcast

490
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It will not be the show itself

491
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But probably promos for other shows

492
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And other fun things that we want to try doing with the podcast

493
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Some of these joke ads and things that we were talking about

494
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We're going to kind of start to get our feet wet with that

495
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So starting next week parts A and B combined in one part

496
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So you no longer have to wait until like Friday or Saturday to hear the whole thing

497
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You will get to download it Monday at the latest

498
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Which will be pretty awesome

499
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Alright

500
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And the third announcement

501
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And my favorite

502
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Is really awesome

503
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Loki why don't you tell the listeners a little more about this

504
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What you've been working on for the past few weeks

505
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes and unfortunately I wish I could say that I was done but I'm not

506
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's okay because at E3 you sometimes tease things that aren't coming out until Christmas

507
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And this should be out a lot sooner than this

508
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's not going to be until Christmas

509
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I definitely hope that

510
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I worked my ass off for the last

511
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Probably about a month on this

512
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Anyways yes you finally are going to get an update to OLRPSP.com

513
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Finally

514
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But there's some good stuff coming with that

515
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The big part of it is actually going to be

516
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The brand new OLRPSP all games radio streamer

517
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Which is going to be

518
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Kind of like the radio players that you see on the PSP

519
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But definitely a lot cooler than all those

520
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
In fact

521
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hopefully that will be released soon

522
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
With that will be the OLRPSP flash chat

523
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I tried my hardest to get IRC chat but

524
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It just wasn't happening

525
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And let me reiterate because I saw the draft of what this looks like

526
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And you're going to be posting screenshots to Orange Lawns Radio a little later on right

527
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This is actually the way it looks in your PSP

528
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It is not something you don't even have to go to OLRPSP.com in your browser

529
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It looks like an application loaded in there

530
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Like the other radio station listeners

531
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
When you click it, it takes you to a live radio feed

532
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That is broadcasting all games radio

533
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is the part that Bobby didn't even know about

534
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It even is taking that little box with the times of the upcoming shows from the website

535
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And showing that as part of the player

536
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It is awesome

537
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And then other things are going to be included with that

538
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
There's also going to be

539
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
All the RSS feeds are going to be in there as well

540
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You'll be able to listen to podcasts

541
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
From all the different shows and stuff

542
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You'll be able to select through that stuff

543
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Details on all the other shows on all games

544
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There's a lot of small things I'm working on right now unfortunately

545
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
IRC chat on the PSP

546
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I even tried buying the PSP IRC script

547
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And the guy is a douchebag and won't fucking sell it

548
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Even for a lot of money

549
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't think you're supposed to say douchebag in an E3

550
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's alright

551
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Breaking new ground here ya douchebags

552
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Anyways

553
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And then I'm going to have some more download stuff as well

554
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I wanted to work on a theme and stuff

555
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But it's just

556
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Seriously I've been in my computer room forever

557
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I will post some screenshots though into chat

558
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So you can see a few screenshots I've taken

559
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But it's still a work in progress

560
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I'm hopefully going to have it done very soon

561
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Alright

562
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Prowler in chat room says

563
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This is already better than last year's Microsoft press conference

564
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Well thank you

565
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We try

566
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So any estimated time on when this is going to be out

567
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Like before the end of the month? August-ish?

568
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm hoping before the end of next week

569
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But we'll see

570
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh and you've even posted a link of what one of the screenshots looks like to chat

571
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's going to be awesome

572
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh there's two coming

573
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So our live listeners get to see it

574
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
For those of you listening on the taped podcast

575
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You can look at those on our forums quite soon

576
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Those will be up very soon on our forums

577
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
OrangeLawnTrader.com click on forums

578
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Alright

579
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That does it again to reiterate our three points

580
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Of this year's E3 press conference

581
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
E3 won't have us so the hell with them

582
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
We're going to PAX and it's going to be even better

583
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Part A and B will be combined starting next week

584
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
With the podcast and the OLR PSP.com

585
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
OLR PSP.com

586
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
New website and radio tuner application

587
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That takes you direct to AllGames.com

588
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Radio feed coming soon

589
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah because

590
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The PSP sucks

591
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And it doesn't, you know, unfortunately

592
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It takes a fucking long time to

593
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Put pages on there because

594
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You make it in a program for the PC

595
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You view it on your PC and it looks nice

596
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And you take it to your PSP and it looks like shit

597
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So it's a long

598
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Process

599
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Well anyhow we are going to

600
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Shift gears and get into our regular

601
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Show tonight as if a press conference

602
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Wasn't enough we have a whole regular show

603
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
To get to and that is tonight's gaming news

604
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And Loki once again starting us off with tonight's gaming news

605
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Alright

606
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Well this is not

607
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
A big surprise but Konami has

608
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Lodged a patent suit against Harmonix

609
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And MTV over Rockband

610
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And

611
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I mean, I don't know

612
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
There's definitely I guess some merit to it

613
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Seeing as it looks very

614
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Similar to

615
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Guitar Freaks Drum Mania, the whole setup

616
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm just surprised it took them this long

617
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But I mean

618
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You know

619
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Maybe they're not licensing the technology

620
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Like Guitar Hero is

621
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So

622
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If that's the case you know I do think Konami

623
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Is owed some money although it is kind of cheap to do

624
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That and then release their game

625
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Which their game looks like a cheap knock off

626
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Of Rockband I don't know it's just

627
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I wish they had done this

628
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
A lot sooner like put out their game

629
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Instead of just bitching

630
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
About the other games coming out

631
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Katamari's Forever in chat says confusing lawsuit is confusing

632
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It is kind of in depth

633
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
What is it that Konami is specifically

634
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Taking issue the way I understood it

635
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It has to do with the controller

636
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's not necessarily so much the game itself

637
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But it seems to be the fact that it's a guitar controller

638
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Very similar to what Guitar Freaks was

639
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
When it was out here in the US

640
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
In very small arcade test markets

641
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
A long time ago

642
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
That's their point of contention

643
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah and they do have the patents in place for it

644
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I mean I'm sure they do because it's been out for

645
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You know years now

646
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So

647
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah I mean they're in the right there

648
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
To defend their patent

649
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
When Rockband first came out

650
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I guess now that they figure there's money

651
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Involved in it and they can make a lot of money off of it

652
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Then yeah that's

653
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
They should do it but at the same time

654
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I kind of wish that they were just leading

655
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You know the music gaming industry

656
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Instead of just trying to follow and just

657
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Make money off of lawsuits

658
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Because now their new game

659
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Which to be honest I don't really care too much about

660
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And it looks kind of cheap

661
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So

662
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't know

663
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Personally I think it kind of stinks

664
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Because you know obviously I enjoy Rockband

665
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But it's kind of one of those things in the back of my mind

666
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I kind of always wondered

667
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You know if Konami sued those folks that did

668
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
In the groove I'm kind of surprised

669
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
They never tried to go after Rockband

670
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And then especially after hearing that

671
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Activision's already been paying them under the table

672
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
For quite some time

673
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
For the whole Guitar Hero thing

674
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Red Octane and Konami have had a long relationship

675
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And then I kind of thought well maybe part of the reason

676
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
This took so long to happen is because

677
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Konami have had somewhat of a long relationship too

678
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
With the whole karaoke revolution thing

679
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But you know the whole timing of this lawsuit is

680
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Awfully odd

681
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
With their games coming out this year and everything

682
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And I think it kind of stinks but at the same time

683
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't know there might be some merit to it

684
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I just hope it doesn't stop Rockband

685
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You know and also I think

686
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You know well with that hole in the groove thing come on

687
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It really was a freaking copy

688
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Of DDR I mean in the groove was

689
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Freaking DDR with minds and like a couple

690
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Innovative things you know

691
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We talked about it way past the history of our show

692
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
About the whole in the groove thing

693
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I mean we all saw that coming a mile away

694
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
By the way we called it too

695
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We said Konami's going to sue these folks

696
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
When they try to invade the home market

697
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And sure enough when that in the groove game

698
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Came out for PS2 that's when Konami

699
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Sicked the Bulldogs on them

700
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But it does make this whole thing interesting that Rockband's

701
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Been out for like a year, year and a half

702
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I mean does it, well not quite a year and a half

703
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But about a year I mean does it take that long for a lawsuit

704
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
To get rolling? No it's just they want to

705
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
See how successful it is now that it's

706
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You know finally come around and

707
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They're going to be putting out their sequel and stuff

708
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
They want a piece of the money

709
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Interesting

710
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
DarkSocker do you have any thoughts on this?

711
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Because I know you twitted some stuff

712
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Earlier in the week I'm curious kind of where your thought is

713
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
At this point in time with the whole suit

714
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I think that it's petty

715
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And ridiculous they

716
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Had their chance when

717
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And you know it was funny remember talking to

718
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Jason Anis all those years ago about

719
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Trying to bring the money

720
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Into the US and

721
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Working on getting Guitar Freaks and everything

722
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
They had their chance

723
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And they had their advocate then

724
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Did they hop on it? No

725
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So someone came along and did it better

726
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And you know what I think you're speaking

727
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
A lot of the same things that the music game

728
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Community is saying is that there's this

729
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Round of disappointment in Konami

730
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Because you know

731
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
They had all these, this Beatmania

732
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Series in Japan was awesome

733
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
The 2DX series awesome

734
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Guitar Freaks, Drummania, people loved it

735
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
People were importing that stuff and everybody

736
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Was asking why aren't you bringing it out here?

737
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And it took one of their own

738
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
People on the USA side

739
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Jason to twist the

740
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Fucking arm of the Japanese

741
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Side and we barely got DDR

742
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And you barely got DDR and then

743
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
DDR was a huge success and

744
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Remember how shitty that first mix

745
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Of DDR was

746
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Everyone was happy

747
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And then it would just cause a landslide to DDR after that

748
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Look how successful it's been

749
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And then Beatmania 2DX the problem was

750
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
They didn't learn from their mistakes

751
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
They released a kind of a shoddy 2DX mix

752
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I mean they took some risks with it

753
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Which were kind of cool at the whole 5 key thing

754
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But it just wasn't enough

755
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
They didn't take enough risks with licensing

756
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That's where Guitar Hero and Rock Band

757
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Whooped them is that they knew what the American

758
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Audience wanted and they went for it

759
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And I'm sorry if this offends you

760
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Anime folks and J-Pop loving folks

761
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
That like the Bamani songs

762
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That are in the 2DX but all of those

763
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Songs would never have worked here

764
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And that's kind of proven

765
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
By the 2DX release over here

766
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It needed more

767
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And that crappy cover of Toxic and

768
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
One Moby song that wasn't enough

769
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It needed like half and half at least

770
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It needed more songs that could have reached out to the American audience

771
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But anyhow

772
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So but my question is

773
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Despite the

774
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The kind of resentment we almost feel towards

775
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Konami for not taking the freaking risk sooner

776
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And now looking almost like a copycat

777
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
With this whole Rock Revolution thing

778
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Does it make it right though?

779
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Does it make it still that their lawsuit doesn't have any ground

780
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
To stand on because as disappointed as I am at

781
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Konami I still go but

782
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
They have a point

783
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't know I mean any thoughts

784
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
On that I mean do you think you still think

785
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's kind of like petty or

786
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I mean I don't know

787
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's still petty

788
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The format I think is so different

789
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And so much

790
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The other thing it has to be

791
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Is whether or not they actually did in effect

792
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Go and re-engineer

793
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You know

794
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What Konami had done

795
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
How long was the trademark out

796
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
For their controllers

797
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And plus I think Red Octane knew what they were doing

798
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
When they originally put out Guitar Hero

799
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
They knew what they were doing

800
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And that's why there's those under the table payments

801
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That's what we're calling it but you know what I mean

802
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
To um Konami

803
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But Harmonic should have known

804
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What they were getting into as well

805
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And I love Harmonic

806
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So Harmonic makes some great games

807
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That's what kind of makes this disappointing

808
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But they kind of should have known that this might happen

809
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It's just kind of disappointing

810
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I don't know

811
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Going off some comments from chat

812
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because I'm sure there's a lot of folks in chat

813
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Gerardimo says 2DX was based on the assumption

814
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That only DDR players had heard of would be playing this

815
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That's why just about all the songs on it are in DDR

816
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Kind of

817
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But they really pushed Beatmania at E3

818
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Like it was their big title but then the title itself

819
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
By the time it comes out

820
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I mean god remember that G4 clip

821
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Where they were calling it a Guitar Hero knockoff

822
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And all the beat uh

823
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Bamani fanboys were getting angry

824
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Remember that

825
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And then some talk as well in chat about the whole MTV Drumscape thing

826
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Shouldn't MTV already have some type of patents on drums

827
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Because of Drumscape

828
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Well even if they have patents on drums they may not have patents on guitar

829
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And I think that's Konami's issue

830
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't think Konami was doing anything about the drums

831
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I don't know

832
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Technically Konami could be sued by the creators of uh

833
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Several of the MIDI guitars too

834
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Or Gibson

835
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Well yeah but

836
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Well Konami's guitars when they first came out

837
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
They didn't really resemble any type of real

838
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You know form of guitar

839
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It was fairly

840
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'd say an innocent design

841
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
If you know what I mean

842
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But um

843
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Obviously the MIDI guitars

844
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Especially ones that have worked on Switch like that

845
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Have existed for you know

846
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Since the 80's at least

847
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Um Game Guru in chat says

848
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
If Immersion could win against Sony

849
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Konami can win against EA

850
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And I think that's what it's gonna be settled out of court

851
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
One way or another I think

852
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I think that's what's gonna happen

853
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Hopefully it doesn't prevent Rock Band 2 or delay it any further

854
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I don't think it will

855
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yeah I don't think it will either I think it'll settle out of court

856
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I think uh they're gonna have to make those payments

857
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But the problem is Konami

858
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Their game that they're bringing out this winter

859
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Is gonna have to really kick ass

860
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And from or they're gonna have that

861
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
They're gonna look like jerks

862
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm honestly I don't see

863
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
How they're gonna innovate on this at all

864
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The bar is very low right now

865
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah I mean

866
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Just looking at their drum set that they have set up

867
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It looks stupid

868
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It really does look stupid compared to some of this other stuff that's come out

869
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
For me it's all about the song list

870
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'd be very and you know well

871
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You know atmosphere and all that is nice too

872
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So I would hope the game is good looking

873
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But uh song list is very very important

874
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Uh Rama says what you all forget

875
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Is that Rock Revolution focuses more on drums

876
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Not guitar

877
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Well that's nice that it focuses on drums

878
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But I still think it should focus on everything

879
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Since you know that's what

880
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Rock Band is doing

881
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Including keyboard

882
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It focuses on everything Rock Band they have you know

883
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Solid you know vocals

884
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
They have solid guitars and drums

885
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It's not just one or the other

886
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Alright well um

887
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
More to come on this as the weeks go by

888
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm sure we'll hear about the settlement very soon

889
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Or at least some type of further comment from

890
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Harmonics and Viacom

891
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And all those people outside of uh

892
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
This is stupid

893
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Anyhow speaking of Konami and their music games

894
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
DDR is still trekking along

895
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And Dance Dance Revolution X

896
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Is the new game that is coming out on the Playstation

897
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
2 or later this year

898
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And you know there's more DDR games coming out for the home consoles

899
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But what might have surprised some people

900
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
This is also going to be an arcade port

901
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Dance Dance Revolution X will be coming

902
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
To the arcades and

903
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It is a whole new cabinet

904
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It looks like it's actually something on a widescreen monitor

905
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Um there's some pictures that have been posted

906
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Over at uh bombanistyle.com

907
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Which I believe came from that

908
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
ZenSI Vanisher site

909
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Of an actual new cabinet and what it looks like

910
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Some of the names have been changed like

911
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Beginner mode is starter mode, advanced mode, course mode

912
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
There's now shock arrows

913
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
In the game which is basically mines

914
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Although I seem to recall DDR

915
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Has had poison arrows before

916
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It was in one of the Ultramix games, go back and look

917
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Um there's also going to be the

918
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Link feature, USB

919
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Cards will now handle edit data

920
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So yeah

921
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Edit data is coming back to the DDR series

922
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Thanks to a USB memory cord

923
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And apparently good edit data

924
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Is going to go worldwide on eAmusement

925
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's pretty cool

926
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The most commonly played stuff will be back in the game

927
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Older songs possibly making a comeback

928
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
60 plus new songs

929
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Including licenses and new originals

930
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And uh developers

931
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Say that they are committed to putting

932
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
1.5 times the amount of new content

933
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Content in future mixes

934
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And another thing I believe I was hearing about this

935
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Betzen is now not involved in this

936
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
They were doing the cabinets for Supernova

937
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Apparently they are not involved in this any longer

938
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That could be part of the reason

939
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm not sure though about all the changes

940
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
More information to come when these machines

941
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Start being spotted out there in the wild

942
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But uh Konami is still trying to do stuff

943
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
With their DDR series

944
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Definitely and somewhat

945
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You know at least

946
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
At least one of those tracks

947
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Is probably going to be pretty good

948
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And now there's folks saying that the poison arrows

949
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Thing is taken from in the group

950
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But correct me if I'm wrong

951
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
In one of the early early DDR games

952
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Like second mix or some crap

953
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Wasn't there like a mode where there were arrows

954
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
That you weren't supposed to step on

955
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I thought in one of the early earlier DDR mixes

956
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
There was something like that

957
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I don't know

958
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I think maybe like challenge mode or something like that

959
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Well there was also the one where you weren't supposed to step on

960
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Any arrows that weren't currently up on the screen

961
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But oh well

962
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't think it's anything that surprising

963
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Honestly and anyway

964
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I didn't really call to mind things that much

965
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Innovation in the first place

966
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You know sure it was something new

967
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But it didn't exactly reinvent the game

968
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So I don't think it's that big a deal

969
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And he's kind of putting it in this new game

970
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I kind of think they're a little dumb anyway

971
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I hope they don't overuse them

972
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
But we'll see

973
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So coming to arcade soon

974
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Well something

975
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That makes me happy in particular

976
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And this makes me uber happy

977
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Is that

978
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
There is going to be

979
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Another Sega Aegis PS2

980
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Release

981
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That is the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection

982
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Which was

983
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I do think

984
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Fantasy Zone 2 DX

985
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Before

986
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But hey it's more Fantasy Zone

987
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And I hope it's actually done up like the

988
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
The Sega Aegis

989
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
One that I already have on PS2

990
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That was part of the Sega Aegis

991
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
2500 set

992
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Which was named that because it was

993
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
2500 yen

994
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But this is supposed to be

995
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
From what this says on here

996
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2

997
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Fantasy Zone Gear, Super Fantasy Zone

998
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Oppa Oppa Galactic Protector

999
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Fantasy Zone 2 Remake

1000
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And the Sega Aegis 2500 Volume 3

1001
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Fantasy Zone version

1002
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Sounds like a lot of Fantasy Zone

1003
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Get ready! Sounds like Do You Want

1004
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Because I think I actually have most of these

1005
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I wonder if Oppa Oppa was

1006
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Fantasy Zone 3 The Maze

1007
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Especially if there's some updated graphics

1008
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And sound and all that's usually a good thing

1009
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I want an Oppa Oppa

1010
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
A little plushy or something?

1011
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I know, I do want one

1012
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Well who knows, maybe they'll be showing this

1013
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Maybe I should cosplay the Oppa Oppa one year

1014
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Maybe they'll show this to Tokyo Game Show or something

1015
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
A little more in it, we'll see

1016
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I told you this story, Rob, but one time I was trying to look for the Oppa Oppa music

1017
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I ended up downloading a

1018
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Happy song in Greek

1019
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's called Oppa Oppa

1020
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Because that means like, yay

1021
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Interesting

1022
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm sure it was a better song than Caramel Dancin

1023
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm sure that's for sure

1024
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Fantasy Zone is still a ways out

1025
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But we have some stuff coming out

1026
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
A lot sooner than that, right Loki?

1027
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes, this week there's some

1028
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Pretty interesting stuff coming out actually

1029
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Especially if you like football

1030
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There's NCAA Football 09

1031
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And that's coming out on

1032
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3

1033
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Xbox 360, Wii, and the PSP

1034
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And also there is a game based off the

1035
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Looks like crap movie

1036
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But Space Chimps

1037
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
That will be out on PC, PlayStation 2

1038
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The Wii

1039
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And I believe the

1040
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
360 and DS

1041
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Also

1042
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Hunting Unlimited, 2009

1043
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Coming to the PC

1044
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That looks like shit as well

1045
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Code Lyoko, Quest for Infinity

1046
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
On PSP

1047
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Nancy Drew, The Clue Bender

1048
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Society on the DS

1049
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
For those who may have Rock Band

1050
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
On PlayStation 2 or Wii

1051
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You'll get your Rock Band Track Pack

1052
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Volume 1 this week

1053
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Which has 30 songs you can play

1054
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And that's

1055
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Let's see here

1056
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And

1057
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I think that's about it

1058
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Trying to keep it I guess a little bit light

1059
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Next week though, or the week after

1060
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Next is actually going to be pretty nice with Final Fantasy 4

1061
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I would imagine

1062
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
There's going to be some surprises

1063
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
With the whole E3 thing

1064
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
At least as far as downloadable stuff goes

1065
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Oh yeah, most definitely

1066
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
In fact I was just pulling up some last minute

1067
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Story things and I've already seen

1068
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Two more speculated Xbox Live arcade games

1069
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That are going to be in there

1070
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
If all the ruined ones come out

1071
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
There will be like four different games coming out next week

1072
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
We'll see what happens

1073
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Hey traveling over to Japan, it's a little bit of a light week

1074
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
For you guys over there too

1075
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Probably for the same reasons as light over here

1076
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Dark Messiah Might and Magic Elements

1077
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
July 17th coming from Ubisoft

1078
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Coming out on other systems

1079
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Such as the Playstation 3, Metal Gear Online

1080
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Makes its way so

1081
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That could also be a reason why it's a slow week otherwise

1082
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Because that's definitely an anticipated title

1083
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That is coming out for only 20 bucks

1084
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So check that out on the Playstation 3

1085
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Also coming out on the Playstation 3

1086
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Tears to Tiara

1087
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Kaka no Daichi

1088
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
That is a game coming from Aqua Plus

1089
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And it not only comes out in Japan

1090
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But all Asia regions on the Playstation 3

1091
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii

1092
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Boom Blocks gets its Japanese release this week

1093
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
That's a game I have

1094
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That I still need to play

1095
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I bought it and I haven't even played it yet

1096
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Because I got a big discount on it

1097
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Because I have friends in low places

1098
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
On the Playstation 2, Shining Force EXA

1099
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And Shining Wind get price reductions into the best series

1100
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But if you want to check out something new

1101
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You can check out Poi Hito Natsu no Kaiken

1102
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That comes out in regular and limited edition formats

1103
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
From Idea Factory

1104
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And taking a look at the handhelds

1105
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
There is a ton of stuff coming out

1106
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Including

1107
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Dragon Quest 5

1108
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be all over that one

1109
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And there's even like matching cases

1110
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And protectors to match that

1111
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It's going to be pretty awesome

1112
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The game Exit gets a DS port as well

1113
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That's actually in Korea however

1114
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Also

1115
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You know I got to get this, Hello Kitty

1116
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
No Panda Sports Stadium comes out

1117
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
On the DS as well as Metal Slug 7

1118
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Comes out this week in Japan

1119
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And with the Hello Kitty game

1120
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Some new Hello Kitty pouches

1121
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
In pink and white so you can carry

1122
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Your game and style

1123
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And if that doesn't work for you

1124
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
How about the Sugar Bunnies pouch

1125
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
That comes out in blue and pink

1126
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's a very girly week in the Nintendo DS world

1127
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But hey at least you have Metal Gear on Playstation 3

1128
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
To counteract that

1129
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And on the PSP

1130
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
There's some stuff over there too

1131
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Gundam Battle Universe makes its way out to the PSP

1132
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And if that's not your style

1133
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Hime Hibe Princess Days Portable is more

1134
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Up your alley coming out on

1135
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
July 17th on the PSP

1136
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
That's your Japanese release date

1137
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I was mesmerized

1138
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I know, awesome

1139
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I have four games

1140
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
That are going to be out in the next week

1141
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And I'm going to go ahead and name one for next Sunday too

1142
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Just because by the time I

1143
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Say anything on that day it'd be too late

1144
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
So given that it'll be the next day already

1145
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So for

1146
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The UK we have three games

1147
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
On the 18th we have, well actually two

1148
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Different systems

1149
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Baroque on PS2 and Wii

1150
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And Guitar Hero on Tour on

1151
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
DS which is not all that fun

1152
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Sorry

1153
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Spoiler!

1154
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And then on the 20th CID 925

1155
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
An Ordinary Life on PSP

1156
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Small week for Europe, sadly

1157
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Very small

1158
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But also I think our Europe releases they really only cover the big

1159
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Big stuff and not a lot of the little

1160
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Stuff like we have over in Japan

1161
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
This list we use has everything

1162
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
On it, not

1163
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Not necessarily all AAA titles

1164
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
How about Virtual Console over in the

1165
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
UK? We do have some fun

1166
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
For the Virtual Console

1167
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The first one

1168
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Sorry I love the description

1169
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That Eurogamer gives it

1170
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm going to quote

1171
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The first of these is Ninja Commando

1172
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
A top down vertically scrolling shooter

1173
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
That has ninja and commandos and time travel

1174
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It also has a rubbish but very funny English translation

1175
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
That's the best description ever

1176
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I cracked up when I saw it

1177
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Ninjas, commandos, what else do you need?

1178
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Time travel!

1179
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Now what else do you need? That's it

1180
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
A rubbish English translation

1181
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Perfect, everything I want in a game

1182
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Make your time

1183
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Art of Fighting 2 is

1184
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Another one which is just a

1185
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Fighting game but it

1186
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Had

1187
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Tons of jokes for Capcom came from that

1188
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Do you know the Art of Fighting?

1189
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And it's

1190
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The game series that also spawned us are

1191
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Dan Hibiki

1192
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It has a fighter named after me, that's all I need

1193
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Robert

1194
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Hello

1195
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You should cosplay him

1196
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
No thank you

1197
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Anyway, the Neo Geo games are going to be

1198
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
900 Wii points

1199
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Translating to 9 euros

1200
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Or 6 pounds 30

1201
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So go get them

1202
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That's an order

1203
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
After E3 you should probably have some more fun

1204
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yep

1205
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Now I'm sure this came to a big surprise to everybody

1206
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
This morning but

1207
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Microsoft has confirmed that guess what

1208
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
The Xbox 360 20 gig

1209
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Pro system

1210
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Has dropped in price to $299

1211
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I am so surprised

1212
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That is a big shocker

1213
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And also surprising and completely not already leaked

1214
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Already

1215
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That there will be introducing a new

1216
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Big console that's going to be

1217
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Arriving early August

1218
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
That will be the current $349

1219
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So they're not really dropping

1220
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
The price, they're just kind of

1221
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Upgrading for the same price

1222
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So at the press conference tomorrow you guys

1223
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Act surprised

1224
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Just act surprised

1225
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Exactly

1226
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Especially when they mention the avatars

1227
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And stuff, pretend that you didn't hear it already

1228
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Or that you didn't hear about

1229
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Some of the lips rumors leaking out

1230
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
There on the internet

1231
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We have never heard of this game called Lips

1232
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That apparently is under development

1233
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
But here's the thing

1234
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Variety magazine which is a magazine

1235
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Really for the industry of entertainment

1236
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It covers mostly movies, television, music

1237
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That stuff, but it does dabble in gaming

1238
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And it talked in a recent article

1239
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
About the Lips project

1240
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So hello, if that wasn't confirmation

1241
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
What do you need

1242
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It is going to be at E3

1243
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Apparently some of the box art has leaked out

1244
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I wouldn't say that, but the wireless microphones

1245
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Have apparently leaked out as well

1246
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So that's pretty cool that they're wireless microphones

1247
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
But get this, I love this

1248
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The microphones apparently have lights in them

1249
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
At the base of the microphone have these

1250
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Colored lights that are supposedly

1251
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I guess they're two rings of

1252
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Light that are blue or red

1253
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And apparently the way you sing

1254
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Controls the lights

1255
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So I guess it's one of those things

1256
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Where maybe it's red most of the time

1257
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I think the blue or red are just to indicate

1258
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Which player it is

1259
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Because they have the same kind of thing

1260
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
On SingStar

1261
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
What's interesting, and you may not remember that

1262
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
From the leaked survey that was out there

1263
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
But they're supposed to be motion sensitive

1264
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Those microphones

1265
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And they allow you to

1266
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
In the game you're supposed to be singing and dancing

1267
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And it's supposed to pick up the movement

1268
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh god

1269
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Get ready to look like an ass in your living room

1270
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I'll pitch you anything

1271
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That little camera works with the game too

1272
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Well I hope it works with something

1273
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Because you know

1274
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I paid good money for that camera

1275
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Exactly, and now we hardly ever get to use it

1276
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
But no, this game does sound cool already

1277
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm very curious to see

1278
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
What the actual game itself

1279
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Because even though we've seen the box art, we've seen the mics

1280
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
We've seen the concept, we know it's probably

1281
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Most likely being developed by the Elite Beat agents

1282
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Folks, we have yet to see screens

1283
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But tomorrow at E3 we should get some screens

1284
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I'm gonna take a wild guess here

1285
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And call me a psychic

1286
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But I'm gonna guess that they're gonna look

1287
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Something very similar to

1288
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Sing Star, Karaoke Revolution

1289
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Rock Band

1290
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And probably Guitar Hero World Tour

1291
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It would be rad though if it was something

1292
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Kinda different, you never know

1293
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Except it probably won't be

1294
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It probably won't

1295
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Stop it Debbie Downer

1296
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Raining on my parade

1297
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Gerardimo says if you sing badly, do you get a light show?

1298
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com

1299
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That'd be kinda cool

1300
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Why should you get a

1301
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Why do you deserve a light show if you suck?

1302
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I don't know, maybe it's

1303
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Consolation Prize, who knows

1304
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
But Lips, that's one of the titles

1305
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I can't wait to hear about at Microsoft Press Conference

1306
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Well

1307
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
You'll have to wait, I'm sorry Rob

1308
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I know, but it's being

1309
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It's being streamed online like everywhere

1310
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And it's supposed to be on TV and all this stuff

1311
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'm gonna watch it during work tomorrow

1312
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Sadly I have to teach tomorrow

1313
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So I can't watch the conference during work

1314
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm gonna be refreshing some of the gaming blogs

1315
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
On my break to see what's announced

1316
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Well how is this for some happy information

1317
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Mega Man 9

1318
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Is actually

1319
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
They said it was gonna be

1320
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
WiiWare coming onto Xbox Live Arcade

1321
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And PlayStation Network

1322
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
That's gonna be kinda weird

1323
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Playing a Nintendo style game on Xbox Live

1324
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
But that's cool

1325
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Now I don't have to worry about storage issues

1326
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
On my Wii, hooray

1327
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It could be some sort of HD version though

1328
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It sucks for you

1329
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It sucks for you Nintendo cause I was gonna buy that game

1330
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And now I'm not

1331
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But for anyone who's gonna get it on Wii

1332
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
It's gonna be about 10 bucks and there is a trailer floating around

1333
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So go find it

1334
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I did watch the trailer for the game and it lets you see

1335
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
What some of the boss monsters look like

1336
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Cause you see little silhouettes of them

1337
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I wonder if this thing looks like a mantis

1338
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Splash Woman for the record looks like

1339
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Kind of a mermaid-ish looking thing

1340
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
More like a naga, she looks like Lady Vash

1341
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Actually

1342
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Warcraft joke, but I'm serious

1343
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That's what she kinda looked like in the trailer

1344
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Like one of those Poseidon ladies

1345
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And some of the other robots are kinda cool too

1346
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
You can only see their silhouettes

1347
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But I am all kinds of excited about Mega Man 9

1348
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I would be more excited if they come out at E3 and say

1349
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It's available now

1350
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
But I doubt it seeing as we've already heard rumors

1351
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Of a September release date

1352
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Still, that's not that far off

1353
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Something else that's not very far off too

1354
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Is a rumored

1355
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Silver DS system

1356
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Which will be coming out in the US

1357
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Now

1358
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
The story actually is coming from

1359
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Go Nintendo

1360
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
They have a source that says

1361
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
That the

1362
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I guess the DS that was with

1363
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Guitar Hero

1364
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
That bundle that came out

1365
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Is gonna be hitting stores

1366
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I don't know what they're talking about

1367
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I mean that's totally news to me

1368
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah

1369
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I would be very surprised

1370
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
If we saw it like in September or something

1371
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And it was actually the silver and black DS

1372
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
That was with the Guitar Hero bundle

1373
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
That would be really surprising

1374
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Wouldn't that be neat?

1375
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That would be neat. Surprising.

1376
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Completely surprised.

1377
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Just as surprising as Microsoft's price

1378
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Conference will be tomorrow.

1379
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But folks do really need more colors for the DS

1380
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I mean seriously.

1381
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I guess they're still selling

1382
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
What about Wii colors?

1383
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
You think Nintendo's gonna give us some Wii colors finally?

1384
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Not that I'd go buy a new Wii

1385
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Just because it's a different color

1386
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
They won't change the color of the Wii

1387
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Until it starts dropping in sales or

1388
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Flattening out

1389
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
If they release a pink Wii

1390
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I would actually consider it for a little bit

1391
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Maybe I could find a good place

1392
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
A good home for my current white, boring Wii

1393
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Who knows. Speaking of rumors

1394
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It's something that's definitely all around this week

1395
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And kinda interesting

1396
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Apparently Duke Nukem 3D

1397
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Xbox Live Arcade screenshots

1398
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Are floating around out there

1399
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I guess this is being shown

1400
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Or this is being lifted off of that whole

1401
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
What do they call that? Partner net?

1402
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
The game costs

1403
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Supposedly 1,337

1404
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Microsoft points, which I'm sure is a joke

1405
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Same for the trial though too

1406
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Actually gonna charge that, yeah

1407
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
But it also kinda makes you go

1408
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Hmm, could it be a photoshop?

1409
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It could be a photoshop

1410
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But what's interesting about it is that apparently

1411
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Some achievements have also leaked for the game

1412
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
The world looks like a cleanup on aisle 4

1413
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Is the achievement

1414
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And to get that

1415
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
You have to step in a pile of poop

1416
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I wish I was joking

1417
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But that is really the achievement

1418
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And the picture of the achievement

1419
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Looks like a pile of poop

1420
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Which makes me think

1421
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
This is even more of a fake, but you never know

1422
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
They had poop in the game

1423
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah I know, but if these screenshots

1424
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Are fake, it's a damn good fake

1425
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I'll give them that

1426
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
But we'll find out

1427
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm sure tomorrow

1428
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Would you think that this might be

1429
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
One of their games, like they did this with Doom

1430
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Didn't they? Then they come out at some European

1431
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
We can't have 5 Xbox Live arcade games

1432
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Coming out tomorrow, or next week

1433
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Sure we could

1434
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I would like that, but we can't

1435
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I think we all would

1436
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Especially something like Duke Nukem

1437
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Dude, if Duke Nukem comes out on the Xbox 360

1438
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I am buying that game day one

1439
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I am fucking there

1440
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I really hope it's not one of those things

1441
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Where I buy it and then I go

1442
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
This was so much cooler when I was 12

1443
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Like Doom was

1444
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Doom, I never really played much of Doom

1445
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Duke Nukem was awesome

1446
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I played that for hours

1447
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
We're so playing some Duke Nukem when this comes out

1448
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Loki, I hope it's not a fake

1449
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And if it is a fake

1450
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Whoever faked it, I hope you burn in hell

1451
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
For getting my hopes up

1452
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I hope you step in many piles of poop

1453
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
For the rest of your life

1454
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And the Middle Eastern curse that applies

1455
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals

1456
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Yes, and poop

1457
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
In your genitals

1458
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Haha, poop in your genitals

1459
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
This show is rated T for trashy

1460
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
For all the toilet humor

1461
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It's rated P for poo-poo

1462
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Speaking of poo-poo

1463
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Hey

1464
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
No, I wasn't talking about you

1465
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I was talking about someone else

1466
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That thankfully doesn't come on this program

1467
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
The king of poopy headedness

1468
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Which would be

1469
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
He who shall not be named

1470
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'll have you know

1471
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And this is just a funny little bit of trivia

1472
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That chat room that I put together

1473
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
For the PSP site

1474
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
The only bad word filter that's on there

1475
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Is Jack Thompson

1476
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And it will actually change it to

1477
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Lord Voldemort for you

1478
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Well done, Loki, well done

1479
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Alright, so yes, what is the latest in

1480
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
your world?

1481
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Well, the judge

1482
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Who is

1483
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I think is in charge of the trial

1484
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Dava Tunis, I guess is the name

1485
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Has referred to

1486
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
He who shall not be named

1487
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
As mentally impaired

1488
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And

1489
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
A raving wild

1490
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
woman

1491
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Wait, a raving wild woman?

1492
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
No, Nick Thompson referred to her as that

1493
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I'm sorry, I gotcha

1494
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
He referred to her as mentally impaired and a raving wild woman

1495
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
My bad

1496
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I wish a judge would refer to him as a raving wild woman

1497
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You crazy bitch, sit down

1498
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Well, the judge

1499
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Has recommended that Tom

1500
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That dude be assessed

1501
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
$43,675

1502
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Fine for legal

1503
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Costs incurred by the Florida bar

1504
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And he has been found guilty

1505
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Of 27 of 31 charges

1506
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
In a misconduct

1507
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Suit and

1508
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
The judge wants him disbarred

1509
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I love that they have it figured out

1510
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Down to the dollar

1511
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
You know what would make that even better?

1512
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
If it was figured out down to the cent

1513
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It is figured out down to the cent, actually

1514
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
On Kotaku, they had the cents

1515
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It was like

1516
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
$36.35 or something

1517
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
It was 35 cents, I remember that

1518
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Hugs and kisses to the folks who made that happen

1519
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
He should be forced to pay it on site

1520
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
To me?

1521
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
No, to the Florida bar

1522
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Alright, fine

1523
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
But then to me

1524
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
He is just a fucker

1525
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And you know what

1526
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
As much as this is actually

1527
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Kind of good news in a way

1528
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
That maybe he will finally be forced to go away

1529
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Although I am sure he will troll all the blogs still

1530
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Just hearing that name

1531
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Lord Voldemort inspires fear

1532
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And anger in me

1533
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So we will be getting to the FUs of the week soon

1534
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
But there is more, apparently

1535
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I just wanted to read the actual first

1536
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Line on this one

1537
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Because I actually did check on Game Politics

1538
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It says the Florida bar has recommended disbarment

1539
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
For a period of 10 years

1540
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
This court respectfully declines to follow

1541
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
The bar's recommendation

1542
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
The case involves

1543
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Factual findings of cumulative misconduct

1544
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
A repeated pattern of behavior

1545
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Relentlessly forced upon numerous

1546
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Unconnected individuals

1547
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
A total lack of remorse

1548
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Or even slight acknowledgement of inappropriate conduct

1549
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So

1550
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So

1551
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
The bottom two things

1552
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I will go ahead and skip to the last paragraph

1553
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Thus after careful consideration

1554
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Of the underlying facts and the

1555
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Instant cases

1556
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Together with the Florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions

1557
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And applicable aggravating and mitigating factors

1558
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
In the precedent case law

1559
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
This court makes the following recommendations for John Bruce Thompson

1560
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
His middle name is Bruce

1561
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Flees in your pants

1562
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
In your genitals

1563
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
A. Permanent disbarment with no leave to reapply for admission

1564
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
B. Disciplinary costs

1565
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Currently totalling

1566
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
$43,675.35

1567
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Nice

1568
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Currently totalling

1569
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Can we burn on the angst now?

1570
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Can we burn on the angst now?

1571
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Apparently news about

1572
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Lord of Voldemort makes you gassy

1573
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I was opening my mouth to say something

1574
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And it said I had a juice burp

1575
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Nice

1576
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Multi-part F.U. Number 1

1577
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
The heat returning

1578
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And

1579
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Number 2

1580
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
To people

1581
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Who think

1582
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That they have the right

1583
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
To tell someone else

1584
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
What to say or do or think

1585
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Just because they themselves are offended

1586
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You know what I mean?

1587
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Why don't people learn how to fucking

1588
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Roll with the punches?

1589
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
No

1590
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Not in general

1591
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's just in general

1592
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
At a point of saturation

1593
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Where I'm just sick with all these people

1594
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Who are like

1595
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I don't like what you did Sue

1596
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Or

1597
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You said a mean thing about me

1598
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And Sue

1599
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And just people who

1600
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Don't know how to get the fuck over themselves

1601
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And get on with it

1602
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
You know what?

1603
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Since somebody says something shitty about you

1604
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Why should it matter?

1605
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And also on the same lines

1606
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
F.U. to anyone

1607
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Now I'm going to say fuck you to anyone who tries to tell me

1608
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
How I should talk

1609
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
This is America

1610
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
There's nothing in the Constitution

1611
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
That limits my ability to say

1612
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Fuck, shit, damn, cock or any other

1613
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
So-called curse word that I wish to say

1614
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
In any type of form

1615
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Unless it is specifically said

1616
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
As part of a private organization

1617
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That these words are not allowed

1618
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
As part of my employment say

1619
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
That's fine

1620
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But I can stand outside of my place of employment and go

1621
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Fuck!

1622
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
All I want to

1623
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And it's legal

1624
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And by the way DarkSakura

1625
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
The lawyers will be calling about the lawsuit with the fleas in my genitals

1626
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I also plan on

1627
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Cursing in front of my children

1628
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'll tell you why

1629
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
The Osborn kids came down only slightly fucked up

1630
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I had a discussion about this with my friend

1631
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Who's a parent as well

1632
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
She's not going to have any problem with

1633
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You know, say if a kid falls and goes

1634
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Oh damn, or shit that hurts

1635
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
She's not going to have a problem with it

1636
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
But have a problem if someone uses it specifically in a

1637
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Derogatory or attacking way

1638
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
So teach someone to be nice

1639
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
You can learn when it's appropriate

1640
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
When it's not appropriate

1641
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
But I'm not going to discourage my children

1642
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
If I ever have any

1643
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
To have to curtail their own freedom of speech

1644
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
For somebody else's comfort

1645
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I don't have kids yet

1646
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Maybe someday, but I'm still thinking

1647
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Kind of a similar thing because

1648
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
If you don't make it such a bad thing

1649
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Then kids won't want to do it

1650
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
You know, half the reason why I think

1651
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That a lot of

1652
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Kids act out about stuff or try to be rebellious

1653
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Kids, I'm sorry, they're going to look for something

1654
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
To be rebellious about

1655
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You say don't cuss, they're just going to start cussing like a sailor

1656
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
That's the truth

1657
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I think that if you set the example

1658
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
That say, well

1659
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It's not something to get worked up over

1660
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
If we don't care

1661
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Then they're not going to try to do it to get attention

1662
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Just give them the proper attention that they need

1663
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Misty in chat says, see that's another reason

1664
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't have an intention of having

1665
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Demon spawn

1666
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm actually thinking in the next two years

1667
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Oh my heck

1668
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
That could be something

1669
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Alright, Loki, your F.E. is the week

1670
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And I'm going to probably still be here every Sunday

1671
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
With the baby?

1672
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Maybe

1673
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
No, I'm going to make Dan babysit

1674
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Anyway, Loki

1675
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
F.E. is the PSP web browser for sucking

1676
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
That's all I got

1677
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Yeah, mine's short too

1678
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
F.U. to smoke, and I don't mean the fighter

1679
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
In Mortal Kombat 3 or 4 or whatever

1680
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Even though he kind of sucked too

1681
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm talking about the smoke that's out there in the air

1682
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Like a fucking volcano blew up in my backyard

1683
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It's pretty horrible

1684
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And thankfully I don't still live up in Chico

1685
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Where all the fires are happening

1686
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Because I hear up in Chico it's raining ash

1687
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Can you imagine if you walked outside one day and it's raining ash

1688
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
That sucks

1689
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's like you are actually living in hell

1690
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
For Dante's Peak

1691
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Without

1692
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Or Pompeii the day before

1693
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah, without

1694
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Frickin' what's-her-name-for-the-Terminator

1695
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Being there

1696
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Alright, alright

1697
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Well

1698
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
There's more rumors

1699
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
We have to say this, I'm sorry

1700
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Gulp Banjo in chat says

1701
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Jamie, have the baby live on air

1702
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It can be an educational thing

1703
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
The miracle of life

1704
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Really?

1705
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I've already discussed it

1706
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
When I do squirt out my own demon spawn

1707
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm going to have a midwife and do it at home

1708
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
When the parasite crawls out

1709
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Actually it's funny, my friend

1710
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Becky is so awesome

1711
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
We kept referring to her baby as her symbiote

1712
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Alright, look

1713
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
We've got to get back to gaming

1714
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
We'll have baby chat another time

1715
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
You know the big reason why you don't want to have babies?

1716
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
What?

1717
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
When you have a baby hanging out around that part of the body

1718
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It shoves the rest of your organs up behind your ribcage

1719
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
That's why moms get heartburn

1720
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's true

1721
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Loki

1722
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Loki, less baby, more game

1723
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Well, these controllers

1724
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
You may be able to use it to shove organs of your enemies

1725
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Up into their ribcage

1726
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
But, I don't know

1727
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Anyways, there's a rumor

1728
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
There's still rumors going around that

1729
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Microsoft's going to reveal some sort of motion controllers

1730
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And if that's true

1731
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Then they're thinking that maybe that these

1732
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Motus Games

1733
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Darwin controllers are actually

1734
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
The 360 motion controllers

1735
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Well, there's a few reasons why they may think that

1736
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
One, the controllers kind of fit the color scheme

1737
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
They are white plastic

1738
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And they've got

1739
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Four lights on them indicating that you can use

1740
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Four at one time

1741
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Which kind of makes them a little bit different

1742
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Than say the Wii remote and stuff like that

1743
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
They're kind of

1744
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I don't know

1745
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
You can attach them to each other

1746
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So you can take two of them and break them apart

1747
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Or make them into one giant

1748
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Remote, which is kind of weird

1749
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
But, they have

1750
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Some video kind of showing off

1751
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Because right now these are only for the PC

1752
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Showing them

1753
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Being used like Tiger Woods

1754
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Lego, Star Wars

1755
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Stuff like that

1756
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So they look pretty cool

1757
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And they work pretty much just like the Wii Remote and Nunchuck

1758
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But they are wireless, which is nice

1759
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
So you don't have a stupid cord tethering you together

1760
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I don't know

1761
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I guess we'll find out tomorrow

1762
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Or today, depending on when you listen to the podcast

1763
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Alright, stay tuned

1764
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I'm sure we'll be talking a lot about the E3 announcements next week

1765
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Do you think

1766
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Microsoft getting into motion control is a good thing?

1767
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I don't know

1768
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I don't know, it would depend on how they did it

1769
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And I'd hopefully

1770
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It would be optional stuff

1771
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Do you think that they would try to release a Wii Sports

1772
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Style game as like their passion game

1773
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Or do you think that would be completely obvious?

1774
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I think that would be kind of stupid

1775
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
But, I could see if they did

1776
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Put out motion control or that you would get a lot more

1777
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Of those crappy games on the 360

1778
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Maybe

1779
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Xbox Live Arcade titles and stuff?

1780
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
That wouldn't be too bad

1781
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I just worry because they don't really support

1782
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
The camera they put out

1783
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
There's a couple games that use it

1784
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
But that's really it

1785
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
But their whole thing right now

1786
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Is they're trying to get a piece of that

1787
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Casual market that Nintendo seems to have

1788
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Kind of a hold of

1789
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I think what's more interesting

1790
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Is

1791
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
What's Sony gonna do?

1792
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
You know, because they want to get into the casual market

1793
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
As well, and we haven't heard too much about

1794
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
What they're gonna do

1795
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And there were rumors a long time ago about new controllers

1796
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And stuff like that

1797
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That they're gonna do something too

1798
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Who knows?

1799
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
We'll see

1800
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
In the meantime, we know this game is coming out

1801
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
But it's been getting a facelift

1802
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And a lot of people were like

1803
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Cool, that's gonna be awesome

1804
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
When Beer Pong

1805
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Did you hear about this? It was frat party games

1806
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Beer Pong

1807
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It was gonna be coming out for WiiWare

1808
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Like an actual Beer Pong game

1809
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Who doesn't love Beer Pong at their local frat party?

1810
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Apparently, the game was rated T

1811
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
So what happened? The game was completely

1812
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Reworked

1813
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It was rated M

1814
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And now they gotta rate it T

1815
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So all the

1816
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
References to booze were taken out of the game

1817
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And now the game is Pong Toss

1818
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Pong Toss

1819
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Instead of Beer Pong

1820
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
You get Pong Toss, but you know, whatever

1821
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I think either way the game's gonna gotta be hokey

1822
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I mean, if you're gonna play Beer Pong, fuck it, play Beer Pong

1823
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You don't have to play it on your Wii

1824
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Or if you're 21 and over only, please

1825
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
If you really do wanna play it on your Wii

1826
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Just, there's a game out right now

1827
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Called Game Party

1828
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It's like 20 bucks

1829
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And it sucks

1830
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I mean, I think it sucks compared to everything else

1831
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
So if you really wanna play this, you can probably find that game

1832
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
For dirt cheap

1833
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
So just buy that

1834
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I don't know

1835
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I will

1836
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
We'll see

1837
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
How much is that? This one's supposed to be on the marketplace?

1838
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Do we know? Probably like 5 or 10 bucks

1839
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
5, cause, we'll see

1840
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
10 is way too much for that

1841
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Okay, now we're gonna get to the mailbag part of the program

1842
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
This is the part where you can send in your emails

1843
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Every week to mailbagorangelandtrader.com

1844
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And we read them live on air for our amusement

1845
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And to poke fun at you

1846
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
No, just kidding, but if you ask a good question, we'll answer it

1847
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
So let's open up the old mailbag, Dark Sakura

1848
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
See what the listeners have to say

1849
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Wii has letters

1850
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
But only three

1851
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Four, sorry

1852
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Short mailbag

1853
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Well, we got a letter from Rob with two B's

1854
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Yay, Rob with two B's

1855
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It says, this is mostly for Skye and Loki

1856
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Because DS dropped me already

1857
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I did not drop you

1858
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I'm telling you right now, I did not drop you

1859
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
That's Dan's friends list

1860
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I was using Dan's friends list with him for a while

1861
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And he has removed people that he does not know

1862
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
So that was not me, it was my husband

1863
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Is this an Xbox Live thing?

1864
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yes

1865
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I did not drop you

1866
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I did not drop you

1867
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I know, it makes it sound like we dropped him

1868
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Like a two dollar hooker, and that's not the case

1869
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Drop the bomb

1870
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's not that I want to be dropped

1871
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
But rather that I don't play many online games

1872
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
The only decent but humbling online play

1873
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Was with Rob and friends on Halo 2

1874
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Whenever I play online, I get overwhelmed by radical and social epithets

1875
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So there's little incentive to go online

1876
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
If I ever become a big online game player

1877
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
In a particular game that one of you has

1878
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I may re-request later

1879
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Also my second Xbox 360 died

1880
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So I haven't played anything on it for a while

1881
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
By the way

1882
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I do have my own gamertag

1883
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I don't use it, but as soon as I remember what it is

1884
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I'll let you know

1885
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And I won't delete you

1886
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
On an unrelated note

1887
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Did you try to switch your controller assignment from 1 to 2

1888
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
When fighting Screaming Mantis

1889
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
On Metal Gear Solid 4, hilarity ensues

1890
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I personally didn't enjoy the

1891
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Swap to disc 2 joke

1892
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Because the loading to hard drive screens

1893
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Are more painful than swapping discs

1894
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
What a dang good point

1895
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
What a good point Rob brings up

1896
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Is that, you know, don't joke about the disc swapping

1897
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Thing and the whole, this is blu-ray

1898
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
When the game has a freaking install

1899
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Good point

1900
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And I don't see the need to delete Rob

1901
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But hey, look, that one game of Halo 2

1902
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Is more than I've played with some people

1903
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And that was fun

1904
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I had no idea

1905
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Blame Dan

1906
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I blame him for everything

1907
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Alright, good job

1908
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
This is from

1909
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Actdeft

1910
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican Actdeft

1911
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
First of all

1912
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I have lots of friendly neighborhood Mexicans actually

1913
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
First of all

1914
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Congrats to your 6th anniversary

1915
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Which I unfortunately missed

1916
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And a belated congrats to Rob for his birthday

1917
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Which I'm getting Rob a present soon

1918
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Thank you

1919
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
A late present

1920
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Second

1921
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Thanks to Rob for remembering me when he

1922
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Interviewed Tommy Tallarico and asking him

1923
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
At Video Games Live we'll return to

1924
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Mexicali

1925
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
That was a pretty good interview by the way

1926
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And it's good to hear he cares for the fans too

1927
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And well I think that's all

1928
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Thanks and ciao

1929
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Yeah it was a long interview but

1930
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
He's definitely

1931
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Passionate and has

1932
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
He's definitely doing a lot for the video game industry

1933
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I was kind of surprised

1934
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You know I kind of thought

1935
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
He was a little more on the

1936
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Hands off journalist reporting end

1937
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
But he does a lot more hands on than you might know

1938
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
At first especially if you're

1939
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Especially if you're basing his opinion of him

1940
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Or if you're basing your opinion of him strictly off of the

1941
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Judgment Day show

1942
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Then you're really missing out, that's one thing I learned

1943
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
This email is sponsored in part by

1944
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Konami, home of Neverending Lawsuits

1945
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
This is Deftest Kebrown

1946
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I see what you did there

1947
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Okay

1948
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Well dun dun dun

1949
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
From Jonathan

1950
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Dear OLR, I have been a long time listener

1951
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And have been tuning into your show for a little

1952
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Over two years now, wow

1953
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
This is my first time writing to you guys

1954
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And oddly enough I am typing this from the

1955
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Wii internet browser since my computer practically

1956
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Died on me

1957
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Wow, emailing from Wii? Impressive

1958
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
My game systems have come in handy during these months

1959
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And I think

1960
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I think it is a blessing that they allow us

1961
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
To do more than just game

1962
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
2 as well as many of your other listeners

1963
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Use my PSP to get my weekly fix

1964
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I don't think that you guys do just one

1965
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Should do just one

1966
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Big show, I mean it could be great

1967
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Having it all at once

1968
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But at the same time as Rob points out

1969
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
We could have spread it out during the week

1970
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
As of late

1971
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I have found the delays

1972
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Of part B to be annoying

1973
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
But I understand that things happen, I'm not fussing at Rob

1974
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
But try to get it in on Thursday

1975
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Or Friday instead of Saturday or Sunday, oh well

1976
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
We've addressed that

1977
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
And hopefully, I know he says he likes having it in two parts

1978
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
But I think the whole

1979
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Split thing, Ultra Army and the whole

1980
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Combined thing, we'll try it out

1981
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
If the listeners don't like it, we'll change it back

1982
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Well anyway I guess this should count from my

1983
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Fe of the week, but regarding the limited

1984
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Friends list on Xbox Live, I think

1985
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
That this is total bull

1986
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
People can't be limited to how many friends they can have

1987
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
To game with, and I think that should be

1988
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Part of the next dashboard update

1989
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I should, no

1990
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I know all of your

1991
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I know all about your

1992
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Problem Rob, I am on Loki's friends list

1993
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Though if you need to contact me

1994
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Okay

1995
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Also for any OLR listeners who would like to add me

1996
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
My gamertag is unfoldedraptor

1997
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Jamie I'm sorry if my email

1998
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Is a bit long for such a great show

1999
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
There is so much to be said, oh thank you

2000
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Keep up the great work

2001
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And don't stop believing from Jonathan

2002
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Florida, home of the never ending supply of dying

2003
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Elderly

2004
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Nice

2005
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
That's a little bit horrible

2006
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
But nice

2007
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
The last email is for me

2008
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Dear Jamie, I know I'm a

2009
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Dear

2010
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Thank you so much for choosing Ristar, one of my

2011
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Favorite classic games of all time

2012
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
As the classic game of the week

2013
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I feel bad for not being present that evening

2014
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
But I'm really sorry if I made you angry

2015
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
But being able to listen to it on the podcast

2016
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Was good enough for me

2017
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And made my day to say the least

2018
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Hi

2019
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Sorry

2020
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
That email reminded me to check something else out

2021
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Yes Rob

2022
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It is a pity that the audio wasn't working

2023
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So to make up for it and my absence

2024
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I will send a few separate emails with attached

2025
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Zip files that contain all of the great songs

2026
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
From Ristar, including my favorite

2027
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Shooting Ristar and Ring Rink

2028
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Which are songs that

2029
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Play in Act 1 of Planet Florida

2030
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And Act 1 of Planet Freon

2031
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Thanks again Osfer, P.S. you win the world

2032
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Well sadly I'm a little lazy

2033
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
To open up your files and open up the

2034
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Massive MP3's but the good news is

2035
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
That YouTube appears to be working

2036
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Tonight so here's a little bit of

2037
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
What you missed out on last week if I can

2038
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Get a little clip here of the

2039
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Actual gameplay

2040
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
And if you want to hear more about this game go listen to last week's show

2041
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That it for email?

2042
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
That be all

2043
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Alright if you want to email us

2044
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2045
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Meanwhile back to the game news

2046
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Yes

2047
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Well

2048
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I don't know what I should really say about this

2049
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's weird

2050
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And uh

2051
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Alright well anyways

2052
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Nintendo has unveiled a brand new

2053
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I guess

2054
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I don't know if it's a franchise but

2055
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Game called

2056
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Rainbow

2057
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And it's uh

2058
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Sounds awesome

2059
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
It's a really strange looking game

2060
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It kind of looks a little bit like

2061
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Viewtiful Joe

2062
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
It combines um

2063
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I guess a mix of action exploration

2064
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And uh

2065
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Manga-esque visuals

2066
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And what's kind of neat about the whole game

2067
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
At least um

2068
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
What they've said so far is that it's filled

2069
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
With like B characters

2070
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
From different games

2071
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Like for example in the trailer that they had on

2072
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Wiifolder.com

2073
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
You see Birdo in there

2074
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Like talking in Japanese and stuff

2075
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
But it's a bunch of weird characters

2076
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
So uh

2077
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
So wait wait it's a brand new IP that borrows from all the other IPs

2078
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Sort of yeah

2079
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Which is characters they hope you don't remember

2080
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Yeah and the main character is

2081
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
This like dude who turns into Captain Rainbow

2082
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
This

2083
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I don't know

2084
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Rainbow

2085
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It's weird looking

2086
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And uh I guess

2087
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
He has a yo-yo attack

2088
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Now you know

2089
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
What's more awesome than Captain Rainbow

2090
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Reading

2091
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Rainbow

2092
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I just want to put that out there

2093
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Wouldn't a Reading Rainbow video game be awesome?

2094
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
One of the other characters I guess was in there

2095
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
As well as the golfer from NES Golf

2096
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
That's kind of rare

2097
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Wasn't that just Mario?

2098
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Interesting

2099
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Anyhow

2100
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
More franchises

2101
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
This is a good thing though

2102
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
They're not just borrowing from all the other old games

2103
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Capcom is starting a new one as well

2104
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
It's an Xbox Live Arcade game that's coming out

2105
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It's called Flock

2106
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Flock is a flocking puzzle game

2107
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
That is apparently

2108
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
It's got to do with like you're in this grid style thing

2109
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
But you're a UFO

2110
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
And you heard these animals

2111
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
And apparently the animals have effects

2112
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
That are affected by

2113
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Certain parts and levels and the puzzle aspects

2114
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Apparently this game is supposed to be

2115
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Kind of like Lemmings

2116
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Over 50 different stages, co-op online play

2117
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And a way to edit your own levels in the game

2118
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Should be pretty neat

2119
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
This is supposed to be their secret project that they were unveiling at E3

2120
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
It doesn't look that cool

2121
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
To be honest

2122
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Here's a little clip

2123
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I know video doesn't work that great over the radio

2124
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
But at least you can hear a little of the music

2125
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Aw it looks cute

2126
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Their little sheath

2127
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
They're hurting everywhere with the UFO

2128
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It looks like a cross between like Kirby Golf

2129
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And Lemmings

2130
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I'll still play the trial if nothing else

2131
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
It might be cool, you never know

2132
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Remember folks, dead raisin wee

2133
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Because they keep saying that's not going to happen

2134
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
But we know better

2135
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
What a flocking interesting announcement

2136
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Alright so

2137
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Yeah, Flock coming soon to

2138
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Xbox Live Arcade

2139
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
That sounds fascinating

2140
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Especially with the little sheep, that was cute

2141
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I like the little cheepy sheep

2142
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Well, some other happy news

2143
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And it looks like they're not at all I guess that

2144
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Daunted by the lawsuit

2145
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
But EA was planning on releasing

2146
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Two new drum kits for Rock Band 2

2147
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And

2148
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
There will be

2149
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
A

2150
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Velocity sensitive

2151
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Drum pad

2152
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And it won't be as noisy

2153
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And it will have reinforced metal

2154
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Pedals

2155
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And clip on cymbals

2156
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And the second one is actually licensed by

2157
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Ion

2158
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And it's called the Ion Drum Kit

2159
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It's a fairly expensive one

2160
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
But there are electromagnetic cymbals

2161
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And adjustable pads

2162
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And metal frame

2163
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And it's supposed to be really sweet

2164
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And expensive

2165
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
There are going to be add on cymbals

2166
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
For the Rock Band drums

2167
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Hmm, interesting

2168
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Um, you know

2169
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
If people will pay like 300, 400 bucks

2170
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
For those arcade style Beat Media 2DX

2171
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And Poppin Music controllers though

2172
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Why not pay a lot of money for these Ion

2173
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Super Duper drum sets

2174
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Although I don't know where the F in my house

2175
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I would put them

2176
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Except out here in the garage, for real?

2177
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I thought the wife hated the drums

2178
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Well they're at work

2179
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Ah, I see

2180
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Boy, you're a real sucker for those peripherals

2181
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
What about you, Dark Soccer? Speaking of suckers for peripherals

2182
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
You've seen the vault!

2183
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I know, are you going to get these?

2184
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Just because I want them doesn't mean I'm going to buy them

2185
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
They're 300 dollars, I mean shit

2186
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
That's expensive

2187
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
For 300 dollars, do you know how many days you could feed

2188
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
A starving child somewhere in the world?

2189
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Probably a year

2190
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yeah, why would I want to feed children?

2191
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Why feed children?

2192
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Unless they're going to build me a kick ass drum set

2193
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You could be playing Billy Idol

2194
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
In Rock Band 2

2195
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
It's a nice day for a

2196
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
White wedding

2197
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Anyhow

2198
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
It's a nice day for some more gaming news too

2199
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Alright

2200
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
How many times have we heard this rumor

2201
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
That there's going to be an announcement

2202
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
During the Nintendo conference

2203
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
That's going to unveil

2204
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Animal Crossing Wii

2205
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I know

2206
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I think, are we really going to be shocked if it

2207
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Gets announced?

2208
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Yes, because it's like OMG it's finally here

2209
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
The more the shock is

2210
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Is it going to look like

2211
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
It's going to actually be kind of different

2212
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And more interesting than the DS one

2213
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I'm guessing they're not innovating on shit

2214
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Since they didn't innovate on hardly

2215
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Anything from the DS and

2216
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
GameCube ones

2217
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I wouldn't be surprised

2218
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I'll still buy it because I'm a consumer whore

2219
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Me too

2220
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
The other rumor that's coming out

2221
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Is Punch Out for the Wii

2222
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
That's kind of a rad surprise

2223
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Like that was one of the things you didn't really think

2224
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Of that, but that makes sense

2225
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
If Wii Boxing was so big, why not

2226
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Throw in the beloved Punch Out characters

2227
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Mr. Dream

2228
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Mike Tyson

2229
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
George Foreman

2230
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Put him in the game

2231
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I guess, we need to fucking Excite Truck 2

2232
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Fuck this Punch Out shit

2233
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
We'll see

2234
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
The news conference is only days away

2235
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
So we'll see

2236
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
We'll see

2237
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Well here's what I'm worried about

2238
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Because Nintendo, they have a trend

2239
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Of following stupid ideas sometimes

2240
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
With the whole Wii Wheel

2241
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And the Wii Zapper

2242
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It was just like

2243
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Hey the Wii Wheel, people buy those stupid

2244
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Third party wheels because they want to pretend

2245
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
That they have a steering wheel because they can't

2246
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Use their imagination

2247
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Let's put one out too

2248
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Hey, they can't imagine that it's a gun

2249
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
It would look like a gun

2250
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
What are we going to have with the fucking boxing gloves or something?

2251
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I mean seriously

2252
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
There's going to be some really retarded stuff

2253
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Coming out I'm sure

2254
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
There'll be storage dammit! I want my storage

2255
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
You know what this show

2256
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Needs you guys

2257
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Before we wrap it up and take some calls

2258
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And get out of here for the night

2259
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
You know what this show needs? More Journey

2260
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
That's right

2261
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
We have some Journey news for you guys tonight

2262
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But it's kind of

2263
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Kind of a little bit saddening

2264
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
About this particular Journey news

2265
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Actually apparently

2266
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Steve Perry who used to be the front man

2267
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
For Journey

2268
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
He did an interview this week with GQ

2269
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Magazine and you can actually read it online

2270
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
At men.style.com

2271
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And he actually talked about

2272
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
The Journey arcade game

2273
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
And if you've never played the arcade game

2274
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Run, do not walk

2275
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
To Mame and check this out

2276
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Yes it's a cheesy game but

2277
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
For it's time period it was awesome

2278
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Because the actual cabinet

2279
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Would play the song separate ways

2280
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
On tape

2281
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
When you beat the game you were at a Journey concert

2282
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And separate ways would play on tape and it was awesome

2283
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And then the aliens would kidnap all their instruments again

2284
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
However Steve Perry

2285
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Says oh no no no

2286
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I never thought we should have done the game

2287
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
He's being your typical rock snob

2288
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
He says everybody went against me on that issue

2289
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Because I thought it was silly

2290
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I've come to find out there's a generation of kids

2291
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Who think it's classic and wish they could find the arcade version

2292
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
But I personally thought it was kind of dumb

2293
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Hmph

2294
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And then you get this

2295
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
As if the ego wasn't big enough

2296
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
See it's funny because I thought that we were big already

2297
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
That we didn't need a video game

2298
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But that's just how the world judges you

2299
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Like gee whiz you have a Lamborghini so you must be big

2300
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I didn't understand that

2301
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Whatever

2302
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Like seriously go watch some of your own 80's music videos

2303
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
And yeah then come back to me

2304
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Come back to me and talk

2305
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I still love Journey though

2306
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
And I still love Steve Perry even if he's a rock snob

2307
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Who kind of said a dumpy thing this week

2308
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Journey's still awesome

2309
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Don't let anybody tell you different

2310
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Right Dark Sakura?

2311
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Right!

2312
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And and and and

2313
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And the ferret

2314
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Alright

2315
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Before we close out the show tonight

2316
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
We have to get some calls

2317
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
We have to pay respect to our elders this week

2318
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
By revisiting the classics

2319
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And we have for you guys

2320
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
If Jamie doesn't drop her microphone much more

2321
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
We have for you a trip down memory lane

2322
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
With this the classic game of the week

2323
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And apparently

2324
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Dark Sakura's opting for

2325
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Like a classic of classics

2326
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Like a just freaking like

2327
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I don't want to say obvious choice

2328
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
But just a choice

2329
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
That had to be here eventually

2330
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Had to

2331
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Right? Absolutely

2332
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So what did you pick for the kids tonight?

2333
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Chrono Trigger

2334
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Of course

2335
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Also it's because Sauce suggested it too

2336
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Oh I was going to speculate maybe it was tied into the recent

2337
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Announcement of the DS conversion

2338
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
That's part of it too

2339
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I had to play like the best music in the game

2340
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
This is like my favorite music in the game

2341
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
My second favorite music in the game

2342
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Let's hear a little louder what is this?

2343
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
It's the old palace music

2344
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Awesome

2345
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Alright go ahead

2346
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Anyway it was

2347
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
A role play game that came out on the

2348
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Super Nintendo

2349
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Super Famicom

2350
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It was released in Japan on March 11th 1995

2351
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
And August 22nd 1995

2352
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
In North America

2353
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
It actually has

2354
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I think it's great they mention this

2355
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Square's dream team

2356
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Was behind it which was

2357
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Hironobu Sakaguchi

2358
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And

2359
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Nobuo Uematsu

2360
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Also

2361
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
The main artist behind the characters

2362
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Was Akira Toyama

2363
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Who did the Dragon Quest series

2364
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
And we better know for Dragon Ball

2365
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And Dr. Slump

2366
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Now remember

2367
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Water summons wind and wind makes fire dance

2368
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
And

2369
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
So

2370
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
A lot of the musical score

2371
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Was done by Yasunori Mitsuda

2372
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Who

2373
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Actually passed on his duties

2374
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
To Uematsu when he fell ill

2375
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
So

2376
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
But a lot of the way

2377
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
That this game played

2378
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Is that

2379
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
It was sort of an action

2380
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Slash sort of turn based RPG

2381
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
You could totally avoid some of the battles

2382
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Because you'd see the enemies hanging out

2383
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
But if you wanted to

2384
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Go into the battle you'd like

2385
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
You would run up to the creatures they would spot you

2386
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
And then your battle sequence would start

2387
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And the style is actually sort of

2388
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Reminds me of later on in the Evolution series

2389
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Did you ever play that?

2390
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Evolution and Grandia?

2391
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Not really I think I've seen it but not really played it

2392
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I've seen some of the elements came in

2393
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
But it was also very much though

2394
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
The Secret of Mana incorporated some of the same stuff too

2395
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Where

2396
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You would see your enemies instead of having

2397
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Just a random

2398
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
You know, encounter

2399
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And you would have

2400
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Everyone had hit points, they would have magical weaknesses

2401
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
But the really cool thing about this

2402
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And this is actually called

2403
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
The Active Time Battle System

2404
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Which

2405
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Actually was designed

2406
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
For Final Fantasy 4

2407
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Which we had up here is 2

2408
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Where you have a personal timer

2409
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
That's based on

2410
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Your character speed statistic

2411
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And you also get text

2412
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
This is your magic attack but the good thing about them

2413
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Is that you could

2414
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Combine your text with other people

2415
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Once you

2416
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Use them enough and

2417
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
You would have like for example the

2418
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Antipode attack so it was the fire and ice attack

2419
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Remember that?

2420
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And you get different levels of those

2421
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Or the

2422
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I just remember Frog's giant bouncing frog

2423
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
That was awesome

2424
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
That's actually in this clip too

2425
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Later on

2426
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Dude this person

2427
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Played through the entire freaking game and it's all on YouTube

2428
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Like 120 some odd parts

2429
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It's huge

2430
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Like 15 minutes a piece

2431
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Ultimaga weapon

2432
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Well the other

2433
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
The other really neat

2434
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Like another example by the way

2435
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
It was combining Chrono Cyclone Tech with Lucas

2436
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Flame Toss to create Flame World

2437
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
As their attack

2438
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Also the other cool thing

2439
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Is because you would guess by

2440
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Using Chrono in the title that it has to do with time

2441
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It did have time travel

2442
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
You could go to the same place

2443
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
In time

2444
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And for a while you'd only have like certain

2445
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Ways that you could do it

2446
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
But as you progressed you eventually got a ship

2447
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
That would let you go through time

2448
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And you would do

2449
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Different things through different parts

2450
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Of the game and the best thing about it was

2451
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
New Game Plus

2452
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Where you would start your game

2453
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Over with everything intact

2454
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Except for

2455
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
The special equipment

2456
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
That were part of the storyline to find

2457
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Like the Masamune

2458
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
The characters in it

2459
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
You had Chrono who was like your main guy

2460
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And his was the

2461
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
The lightning based attack

2462
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I do believe

2463
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And then you had

2464
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Luca, you had Marle

2465
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
You also had a bonus character

2466
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Which was Magus

2467
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
But you can either

2468
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Keep him or let him go depending on whatever you said to him

2469
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You also had

2470
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
A bajillion different endings in this

2471
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And to refer to the

2472
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
The actual

2473
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Super Nintendo version, sorry

2474
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
You actually do believe that you had

2475
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Fourteen endings I want to say

2476
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
So it was actually

2477
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Fairly sweet

2478
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Including one where you get to hang with the developers

2479
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Which is kind of cool

2480
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
That one was my favorite just because

2481
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Sorry about that high pitch noise, that's the game they're transporting right now

2482
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
But um

2483
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
It was just

2484
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
The game was epic

2485
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And there was a Playstation release

2486
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
That had I do believe

2487
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
An extra dungeon in it

2488
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And also another ending

2489
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Plus it had animated cut scenes

2490
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
In it

2491
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
As far as the

2492
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Original release

2493
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
It actually did have

2494
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Some pretty interesting

2495
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I guess innovations to the cartridge itself

2496
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
There was however a bit of controversy

2497
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
That an

2498
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Unfinished version of the game

2499
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Had a ROM linked up

2500
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
On the internet

2501
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Back in 95

2502
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
That had

2503
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Music that was not used in the game

2504
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
And a dungeon called the singing mountain

2505
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And another

2506
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Character that

2507
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
There were other sprites for characters

2508
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
That never were used

2509
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I wonder if we'll see that in the DS

2510
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Well um

2511
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I do want to say that I think

2512
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
That level

2513
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Was used eventually

2514
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
But I never played the Playstation version

2515
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
So I'm not, don't quote me on that one

2516
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And also Chrono Cross was

2517
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
A true sequel to it

2518
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
In one of the

2519
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Anime cut scenes

2520
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
That was for Chrono Cross

2521
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It led up to Luca

2522
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Finding a kid for

2523
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Sorry for Chrono Trigger, it led up to Luca

2524
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Finding a kid for Chrono Cross

2525
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
It was sort of interesting

2526
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It's rumored also

2527
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
That Chrono Trigger is supposed to be coming

2528
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
On to

2529
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Virtual console

2530
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
There is going to be a DC

2531
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
DS sorry, DS release

2532
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Which in my opinion

2533
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Means the Virtual Console 1 won't happen

2534
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Why would they only make $15 off the Virtual Console 1

2535
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
When they can charge $35.40 for the DS 1

2536
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Unless they're going to innovate something

2537
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
But it looks so far

2538
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
The trailer is actually up at ChronoTrigger.jp

2539
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Or.co.jp

2540
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
So you can see it looks just the same

2541
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
But there was another

2542
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Project that I don't know if you had ever heard of

2543
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Called Chrono Resurrection

2544
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I think we covered it on the show a while ago

2545
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
But yeah, it looked awesome

2546
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
And basically they were

2547
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Redoing the whole thing in 3D

2548
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
And Squenix did release

2549
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Cease and Desist

2550
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
There are supposed to be ROM hacks

2551
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Out there

2552
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
But

2553
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
As to where you can find them

2554
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
If someone can find them, let me know

2555
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
There's also plenty of good music

2556
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
There's actually

2557
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
An acid jazz

2558
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Soundtrack release called Frank of Time

2559
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
It's actually really good at listening to music

2560
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
There's also

2561
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Play Concerts had some

2562
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Chrono Trigger music in it

2563
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And of course there's the regular soundtrack

2564
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And of course you can find

2565
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
There's an album called

2566
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Time and Space, a tribute to

2567
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Yasunori Mitsuda

2568
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
And Chrono Symphonic

2569
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Which was released by Overclock

2570
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Wow

2571
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Lots of stuff on Chrono Trigger

2572
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Lots of fan art

2573
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I had a thought, you know how the rumor was going around

2574
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
That the Final Fantasy 11 folks are

2575
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Supposed to be working on a new MMO

2576
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
That's not Final Fantasy, what if it was

2577
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Some type of Chrono Online

2578
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
RPG, I bet it would work

2579
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
The Satellaview had a release

2580
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
A spin-off game

2581
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Called Chrono Trigger Jet Bike

2582
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Special, which is a mini-game

2583
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
The whole racing scene that I hated

2584
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
In Chrono Trigger

2585
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
There was also

2586
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
A 16 minute OAV

2587
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It was called

2588
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Numa no Monja

2589
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Time and Space Adventures

2590
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Which was

2591
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I actually downloaded it today

2592
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
But I watched it all on YouTube earlier

2593
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
It's very silly, but it's got

2594
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Some funny stuff in it

2595
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It's actually pretty cute

2596
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Radical Dreamers

2597
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Was

2598
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Like a

2599
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Scenario version

2600
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
That was a side story to Chrono Trigger

2601
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
That came out on Satellaview on X-96

2602
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
So

2603
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
There you go

2604
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Alright, your classic game of the week

2605
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Been a long time coming

2606
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Chrono Trigger

2607
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
For the Super Nintendo and soon to be a bunch of others

2608
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
PlayStation I guess you could say

2609
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And soon to be the DS

2610
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Who knows, maybe someday if people get what they want

2611
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Virtual Console, there you have it

2612
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Alright, now we are going to go

2613
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
And take your calls on the Skype line

2614
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
At 1877

2615
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Game OLR, username on Skype

2616
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
However, quickly

2617
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Before we take calls, I want to say tonight

2618
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
We really want to hear your predictions

2619
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
For E3

2620
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Especially like Wild One, don't name things that have already been

2621
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Somewhat confirmed, but what are your

2622
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Kind of predictions for E3 tonight

2623
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2624
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
It's the one and only Ravenstaufen

2625
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Well, hello one and only Ravenstaufen

2626
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
How you doing?

2627
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Are you heading out to PAX to represent Deadpix Alive?

2628
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Loserly will

2629
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Oh, not you, well that's too bad

2630
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
But ok, at least you got some representation

2631
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Hey, we're asking everybody tonight

2632
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
What are your predictions for E3 this year?

2633
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
What do you think is going to happen?

2634
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I think Reggie is going to come out and just announce something insane

2635
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
He's just going to pull down his pants and say

2636
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Here it is

2637
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I don't know about that

2638
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I think there might be

2639
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Laws against him doing that in public

2640
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
No really, anything game related

2641
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
That maybe hasn't been touched on

2642
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
That you think we'll see at E3?

2643
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Or that you want to see?

2644
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
You know what, I'm probably going to be the only one

2645
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Here, and I'm

2646
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Going to predict Wii Fit 2

2647
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Wii Fit 2, this early

2648
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Really, I would think if we're going to get Wii Fit 2

2649
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
We'd hear about next E3, but that's just me

2650
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Or some expansion of Wii Fit

2651
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Because it's good, don't get me wrong

2652
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
It's really good, but it's slim

2653
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
So they need to put something out now

2654
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
What do you think though

2655
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
If Animal Crossing and Punch-Out

2656
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Are their big flagship games for the Christmas season?

2657
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Dude, Punch-Out

2658
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Punch-Out with the

2659
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Balance Board would be hot

2660
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
It would be kind of fun

2661
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
It would be nice

2662
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
BlackWolf says they're going to announce when they actually put more Wii Fit

2663
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
On shelves, I still can't find one

2664
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Me neither, I tried to look for it when I bought

2665
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Civ Rev Lucian and they didn't have it

2666
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I lost 20 pounds

2667
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
On Wii Fit

2668
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Really?

2669
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
See, ever since my pancreas issues, I've lost 30 pounds

2670
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
And I'm just thinking, God, how much more could I lose

2671
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
If Wii Fit got in the picture, you know?

2672
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Crazy

2673
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Anything else, any other predictions for E3 this year?

2674
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Not really

2675
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Just that

2676
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Just mostly, Sony's going to probably announce

2677
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Probably an internet browser

2678
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
For the, I mean

2679
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
A radio

2680
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
A radio for the PS3, because that would be nice

2681
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
That would be nice, more listeners for us

2682
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I am all for these independent

2683
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Applications and ways to get the

2684
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Independent radio out there

2685
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Down with corporate radio, boo

2686
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
One more thing

2687
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I did get the iPhone 3G

2688
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And it's nice and fast

2689
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Dark Soccer, you should get

2690
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Shazam for your iPhone

2691
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
What's Shazam?

2692
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Does it have anything to do with Captain Marvel?

2693
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
It does nothing to do with Captain Marvel

2694
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Basically, it listens to

2695
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Say you're listening to a song

2696
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
And you have no idea what it is

2697
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And the iPhone will listen to that song

2698
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
And tell you what it is

2699
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
That's kind of cool, that's like some of those Verizon phones

2700
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Yeah, I've heard about the Verizon thing, that's kind of neat

2701
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I've got a real obscure song that I need a title to

2702
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
So, I may have to hit that up

2703
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Wait, wait, wait

2704
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
You may have a usefulness for an Apple product?

2705
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Well, I've tried those other services

2706
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
That listen to the song

2707
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
And they can't figure it out

2708
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Interesting, I bet you

2709
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It probably only works with well known songs

2710
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
This is obscure enough, but we'll see, you never know

2711
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
That's why there's this radio station

2712
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
The one radio station I will listen to

2713
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
In town, is completely DJ free

2714
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
And it plays the music I like

2715
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Which is like 90's, 80's and

2716
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Today music, but it's all kind of alternative-y

2717
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
But at the end of every song

2718
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
They say the name and the artist

2719
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
There's no DJ's on the network, but there's this little robotic

2720
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Voice that will say, for instance,

2721
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Today I heard Duran, Duran

2722
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
The Reflex, which is awesome

2723
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
The Reflex

2724
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It's an awesome radio station, I gotta say

2725
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Which is funny because it used to be the dentist office music station

2726
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
But now it's pretty awesome

2727
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Anyway, any other quick thoughts? We gotta go

2728
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yeah, one more thing

2729
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
One more thing, last thing

2730
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
The remote for the iPhone

2731
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
To control your iTunes is great

2732
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That one is my favorite app

2733
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I like the application called Flashlight

2734
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Because I imagine you push a button

2735
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
And it just turns your screen white

2736
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Flashlight

2737
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
It sure is, and I haven't tried that yet

2738
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
iPhone is a flashlight, you can use that

2739
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
How about an OLR app?

2740
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
We need an OLR app on iPhone stat

2741
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Are you working on it?

2742
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
You are not working on it

2743
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Someone work on it for us, and bring our text-based game to

2744
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
To iPhone, we need

2745
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
iPhone Zork

2746
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Alright, we gotta let you go, we want more predictions

2747
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Take care, buddy

2748
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Good luck with Dead Pigs Alive

2749
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Hi, you're on Orange Line Radio, who's this?

2750
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Hey, hey, it's Ronneman from New York

2751
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
You have been on the show too damn much recently

2752
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
How was the flight back, good?

2753
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Yeah, there was a slight issue getting back

2754
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
But we'll save that for another time

2755
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Alright, fair enough. Hey, what are your predictions for E3?

2756
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I believe I told you that last week

2757
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
And I'll say it again

2758
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Reggie Fils-May will come out on stage

2759
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
And not just cockslap everyone

2760
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
With his Wii as Raven Dolphin said

2761
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
He will announce Star Fox

2762
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
With twin sticks using the

2763
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Wiimote and nunchuck

2764
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I could go for that

2765
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
There hasn't been any Star Fox

2766
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Lovin' on the Wii, I could go for that

2767
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
That's a realistic prediction

2768
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Hell yes

2769
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Anything else? What about the other systems

2770
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
You Nintendo fanboy? What about Xbox and

2771
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Sony World?

2772
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Since they're doing this 60 gig thing

2773
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I see them coming out saying

2774
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
To everybody who bought a 360

2775
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
In the past three months is getting a $50

2776
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Rebate check and they're going to

2777
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Announce 60 gig hard drives

2778
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
For pickup because I'm running out of

2779
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Space in my 360

2780
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I doubt you on that one

2781
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I think that goes with one of those early adopters technology

2782
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
You just get screwed

2783
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
You know what though, I still have the 20 gig and I'm doing fine

2784
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
But I don't download movies or any of that stuff

2785
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
And I don't rip a lot of music

2786
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And I uninstalled Final Fantasy XI

2787
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
So I have most of my space, you know?

2788
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
We have Guitar Hero and Rock Band

2789
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
In the house, so yeah

2790
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
One of those two, I don't download everything

2791
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
But I download enough

2792
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I will say though it is getting full

2793
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
But I've been just deleting arcade trials

2794
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
That I don't really use and I'm

2795
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I usually got enough room

2796
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
But at least it's got a

2797
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Decent amount of space unlike a

2798
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Certain other system which won't be named

2799
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Which would be my prediction

2800
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
If you ask me my prediction for E3

2801
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I do think

2802
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Our friends, Reggie Fils-May

2803
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Is going to come out and address that issue and make that other guy

2804
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
From Europe look like the jackass he is

2805
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I hope, I hope

2806
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
That's please plausible, I actually believe

2807
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
That one more

2808
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
The next conference will be on Xbox.com

2809
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And it will probably be on Microsoft's site

2810
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
They normally feed those

2811
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I want to say if I remember right

2812
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
And I apologize if I misappropriating this

2813
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Because I'm going to be talking about someone else's show

2814
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
But I watch Twitter and I follow other podcasters on Twitter

2815
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I want to say Gamertag Radio

2816
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Is running the Xbox conference

2817
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Of course, because you know, Gamertag, hello

2818
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
But I think they're running the Nintendo one too

2819
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
On their site, so check it

2820
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Awesome, I might definitely do that

2821
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Yep, alright

2822
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
We got to get more prediction calls, okay

2823
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Cool, no problem, later guys

2824
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Bye Jamie

2825
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
What, no bye for Matt?

2826
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Whatever

2827
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I love you Loki, you alright man

2828
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Alright, take care

2829
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
That was pretty good, I got to say

2830
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2831
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Hi

2832
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Hey, you're dropping out there a little bit bud

2833
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Make sure you got everything else shut off

2834
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
On your internets

2835
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
That's alright

2836
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Alright, give it a try, quickly

2837
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
What are your predictions for this year's E3?

2838
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Identify yourself too, who are you?

2839
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to say Gold Banjo

2840
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Well hello Gold Banjo, what are your predictions for E3 this year?

2841
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Okay

2842
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Well, I'm hoping for maybe an F0 Wii

2843
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
But I don't know if it'll happen

2844
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
That is a mighty fine prediction

2845
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
And it may be a little bit fanboyish

2846
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
But I'm with you on that

2847
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Because I still will play F0 on the GameCube

2848
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
F0 GX, I love F0

2849
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Like, that is one of my favorite racing series, I love it

2850
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And GS68

2851
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
And what Rama said, I guess I'm hoping for that too

2852
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
All the predictions so far are pretty good

2853
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I don't know how many of them we'll see

2854
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
But I'm excited about it

2855
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
GS68 in chat says F0 is a dead series

2856
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I hope to hell you're wrong

2857
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I hope you're wrong, because I don't know about you Loki

2858
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Aren't you a big F0 fan too?

2859
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I was only the last one, it was alright

2860
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
The problem with the arcade one, the only problem I had with the arcade one was the fact that

2861
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
It only had four tracks

2862
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
But my god, the GameCube and the way it linked together was awesome

2863
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
And just, oh man, I just

2864
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Only problem was finding an arcade cabinet

2865
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Is what?

2866
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Finding an arcade cabinet

2867
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Yeah, yeah, true true

2868
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Well, any other quick predictions?

2869
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
A lot of our callers are jumping right to Nintendo

2870
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
What about Microsoft and Sony camps?

2871
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Anything you got there?

2872
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Um, I don't have a PS3 or a 360

2873
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
So who cares? Fuck them, right?

2874
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Yeah, one more thing about the F0 thing

2875
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Sure sure

2876
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
On the F0, you know the F0 expansion pack, right?

2877
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
For that cancelled add-on for the N64

2878
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Oh right, huh?

2879
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
They had a car and track editor

2880
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
But yet they never added that into GX when it came out

2881
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Maybe I would hope that they would add that for the Wii

2882
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
And maybe some track and car sharing and stuff

2883
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
That'd be awesome

2884
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
That'd be pretty cool

2885
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I'm gonna go play some F0 GameCube tonight

2886
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Oh

2887
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I got my GameCube controller for Mega Man

2888
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I got a new memory card for the Mega Man game when I bought it

2889
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Now I'm itching to play some F0

2890
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
So thanks a lot

2891
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
That's all good

2892
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Alright, we gotta let you go buddy

2893
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Take care and happy E3

2894
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Yep, you too, bye

2895
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Alright, bye bye

2896
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
If you wanna give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

2897
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio

2898
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2899
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Hey, this is Akdeft

2900
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Hey Akdeft, I love your icon on Skype

2901
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
By the way, it's a little Kirby chef

2902
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
It's awesome

2903
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
And it looks like it's eating something

2904
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Is it inhaling a cupcake? I can't tell

2905
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It's awesome though

2906
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
What's your predictions for E3, sir?

2907
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I have two

2908
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
One Nintendo related, another Sony one

2909
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Let's give it some variety

2910
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Let's hear your Sony one first

2911
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Because everyone's done Nintendo right off the bat

2912
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Okay, my Sony one is

2913
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Sly Cooper 4 for the Playstation 3

2914
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Or maybe a PSP game

2915
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
A what for the PS3?

2916
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Sly Cooper

2917
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Oh, okay

2918
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Sly Cooper

2919
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Cool, okay

2920
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
So some game announcements

2921
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I definitely hope that it's going to be announced

2922
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
It's a far shot

2923
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Any reason why you're going for Sly Cooper?

2924
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Well, definitely

2925
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Maybe because mainly

2926
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Excuse me

2927
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Because I'm a fan of the series

2928
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
So I really hope that this time

2929
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
It's going to be announced

2930
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
No reason you can't have a little fanboyism

2931
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
In your predictions, what about Nintendo?

2932
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
A new Kirby game for the Wii

2933
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
And so your icon's not just a clever icon

2934
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Yeah, a Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool

2935
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately

2936
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
A new Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool

2937
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately

2938
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Well

2939
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
The Kirby franchise needs a new

2940
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
A definitely new game

2941
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Like a lift-off

2942
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
That Kirby drawing game

2943
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
On the DS

2944
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Might be kind of fun on the Wii

2945
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I actually liked that game quite a bit

2946
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I don't remember, did it touch All-Stars or something?

2947
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
I liked that game, it was fun

2948
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Yeah, one of my predictions on the forums

2949
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
For this year was going to be a port

2950
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
With using that same gameplay

2951
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,000
So I hope that Nintendo announces this on E3

2952
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Alright, we'll see

2953
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Akdeft, any other quick last thoughts before we get to some more predictions?

2954
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:26,000
No, just thanks on the question for Tomotaro Rico

2955
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Hey, no problem

2956
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Hey, this show is not just about the three of us

2957
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
It's about the listeners

2958
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
When we can ask questions that we know our listeners don't want to hear

2959
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
We ask them

2960
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Alright, take care buddy

2961
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
And I hope it does get back to them, by the way

2962
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I think this will be our last call

2963
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Then we're going to call it a night because we're running pretty long

2964
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2965
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
DS68

2966
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Well hello, you got through

2967
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
What's your predictions for E3, buddy?

2968
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
The employees of Konami and Harmonix duke it out

2969
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Over the whole Rock Battle lawsuit

2970
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And it's a myth that an arcade game gets announced at E3 and the whole universe dies

2971
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
So are you suggesting that Konami should bring back their Rumble Roses models

2972
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
From a few E3s ago

2973
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
And they can duke it out in Cream Corn or Jello Wrestling?

2974
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
No, I was joking

2975
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I wasn't

2976
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Maybe, like you and some other cars have said

2977
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Maybe Nintendo will address the storage space

2978
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
To some sort of attachment to the Wii

2979
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
That applies to the USB drive or something

2980
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Yeah, just a patch that they could release overnight

2981
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
That will let the USB drives work

2982
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I don't know, call it a hunch

2983
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Also, freaking Super Mario RPG gets it released on Virtual Console

2984
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Ah, now there's a good fanboy prediction

2985
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console

2986
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
We know it's coming eventually, right?

2987
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
We heard the Japanese one

2988
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
So you would think if it's coming out in Japan

2989
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
It's got to come out here eventually

2990
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
So we'll see

2991
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Any other predictions, sir?

2992
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
What about the Sony and Microsoft end of things?

2993
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Well, I don't really know because

2994
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
The only next-gen console I was at was the Wii

2995
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I don't feel like I lost somebody for 360 or PS3 at the moment

2996
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
How about, I'll give you a fanboy one

2997
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Because I would love to see this someday

2998
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
How about a company announces in partnership

2999
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
With either Microsoft or Sony

3000
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
A localized version of Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune

3001
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
For consoles?

3002
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
No, I don't know

3003
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:33,000
That game seems like the kind of game that they're playing in arcades

3004
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
The PS3 version of Wangan Midnight sucks balls

3005
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Well, because it's a different thing

3006
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
It's not related to the actual arcade series

3007
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
That game's based off the arcade series

3008
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
But the problem is though

3009
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
It's a port of a PlayStation 1 game, I think

3010
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
No

3011
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Well, because it's based on

3012
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:57,000
It and the original Wangan Midnight arcade game were based on Tokyo Extreme Racer for the PS2

3013
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Or Dreamcast

3014
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
So the magic just belongs in the arcades

3015
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
It doesn't need to be brought home

3016
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Yeah, some things in the arc

3017
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I mean, that's what the arcade needs

3018
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
More things that you can only experience in the arcade

3019
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I mean, these days you can just easily port shmups and fighters to the consoles and PCs

3020
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Fair enough, I'll give you that, sir

3021
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Alright, we're gonna wrap it up, GS68

3022
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
But thanks for the call, have a good one, okay?

3023
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
You too

3024
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Alright, later

3025
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
We will see what happens at E3

3026
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
It all starts this week

3027
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
It's gonna be awesome

3028
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
In the meantime though, we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts

3029
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
And wrap up the show tonight

3030
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

3031
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Think for yourself and learn to be offended

3032
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
My final thought is

3033
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I want a Hot Pocket

3034
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Loki

3035
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
My final thought is I have a bunch of last minute stories

3036
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Oh yeah, we never get to last minute stories, I'm sorry

3037
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Alright, last minute stories then, quickly

3038
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Okay, real quick

3039
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Madden soundtrack's coming to Rock Band's download content

3040
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I guess that's kinda cool

3041
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Did I leave that off the showroom? My bad

3042
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Yeah

3043
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I'm a dummy, alright

3044
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Oni-chanbara, that game with the chicken lingerie and a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword

3045
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Is coming to the Wii in the US now

3046
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Fuck yeah, that's awesome

3047
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Here's one of my predictions to come out of E3

3048
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
That there's gonna be a software patch for the Wii that will allow you to use the Wii classic controller

3049
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Or perhaps this brand new trademark patented controller that Nintendo will be putting out

3050
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,000
To be used with GameCube games

3051
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Instead of having to actually have a GameCube controller

3052
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
That makes sense

3053
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Because they now have a new thing that looks like a very blocky version of a GameCube controller

3054
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
That's kind of interesting

3055
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Lots of rumored Xbox Live Arcade games to be coming out tomorrow through next week

3056
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Including, there is a game by Bungie that's supposedly gonna debut on Xbox Live Arcade tomorrow

3057
01:49:53,000 --> 01:50:00,000
There's also a rumor that they're gonna surprise us with Geometry Wars Retro Vault 2

3058
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
That might be the surprise thing tomorrow

3059
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:12,000
There are a couple other games that they mentioned as well, including, I don't know where to go here

3060
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:18,000
There is some other like crosswords game that's gonna be coming out

3061
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Which I don't know, that didn't look too exciting at all

3062
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
They did announce that though, that's really happening

3063
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Yeah, that's really happening

3064
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:31,000
And there was also some other game, a shooter game, Shred Nebula

3065
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
That's actually gonna be coming out

3066
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Dude, I would not want to be crappy crosswords game in the week that Duke Nukem or Geometry Wars 2 or these other rumored things get released

3067
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Exactly

3068
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
There's one thing I do know

3069
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:50,000
There was an article, it was actually this week, about Blazing Lizard

3070
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I guess they're being represented by Flash Man Studios

3071
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
And you may not know who Blazing Lizard is

3072
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:01,000
But they're the ones behind Pirates vs Ninja Dodgeball on Xbox Live Arcade

3073
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
And they have an unannounced title for the Wii

3074
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I know what that game is by chance

3075
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And it actually is Pirates vs Ninja Dodgeball

3076
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
It's coming to the Wii now too

3077
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Let's see, there's a pretty cool little game coming out called I Heart Geeks

3078
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,000
It's a rude Goldberg puzzle game, kind of like in The Incredible Machine

3079
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:31,000
And apparently there's some leaks out of Sony's support site about upcoming titles

3080
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Including Punisher Warzone for the PS3

3081
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:42,000
And Maxim Pinball, Cinnamon Beats, Alien Sports Mini Golf, and Under Fire

3082
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Kind of interesting

3083
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
There's gonna be a new Wolfenstein game at E3 this year

3084
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,000
In fact that's already in the new Game Informer magazine

3085
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
So check that out, it's pretty cool

3086
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:59,000
And also rumored that Rock Band 2's setlist includes Guns N' Roses

3087
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:05,000
And the Chinese Democracy Trek

3088
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,000
That would be a pretty awesome little surprise

3089
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
That could be very interesting

3090
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,000
And that's all I really want to talk about right now

3091
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Alright

3092
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Oh, I'm sorry, one more thing

3093
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,000
This is completely random

3094
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I saw there was this list that was on game trailers

3095
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
It's eight extremely embarrassing E3 moments

3096
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
And the one that they have in the very beginning on here is Jamie Kennedy

3097
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Remember his Activision little spiel last year was completely embarrassing

3098
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
And he wasn't very funny

3099
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I actually met Jamie Kennedy this Wednesday

3100
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I have a picture with him actually

3101
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
It's pretty crappy

3102
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
And I have a new autograph for our autograph wall

3103
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Hooray

3104
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
He's actually pretty funny in person

3105
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I need to put the freeze-pop autograph up by the way

3106
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
That Rama got me for my birthday

3107
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And I'm digging that new freeze-pop album actually

3108
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
It's pretty fun

3109
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Good times

3110
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Alright, your final thought, Loki

3111
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
My final thought is I hopefully will finish OLR PSP this week

3112
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I know my wife is really hating that I'm working on this

3113
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Did you want to change your final thought, Dark Soccer, since it's been so long?

3114
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
No

3115
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
And I will agree with Game Guru on a last final thought

3116
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
E3 better rock

3117
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I agree, especially since we're not there to party away

3118
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Anyhow, meanwhile, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting

3119
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
And supporting Orange Lounge Radio

3120
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
And just all independent radio with your support

3121
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Remember if you like our show, we do it for free

3122
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Just tell two people you know about Orange Lounge Radio

3123
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Spread the word, that's all we ask

3124
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
And slowly but surely we take over the world

3125
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
That's how it works

3126
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Until next time, we'll be back next week with all of the E3 news

3127
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,000
And if anything especially strikes us, we may go live mid-week

3128
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
We'll see, well not live, but a tape thing

3129
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Because we can't invade other all-game show space

3130
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
But maybe something mid-week, we'll see

3131
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
In the meantime, I'm Rob Roberts

3132
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
She's Dark Sakura, he's Loki

3133
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
And this is Orange Lounge Radio

3134
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
