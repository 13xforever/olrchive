1
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:24,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, July 13th, 2008, a major lawsuit happens in the music game world, Mega Man 9 is set to go multi-platform, and we take calls on your predictions for this year's E3.

2
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,212
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:47,073
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts and join me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:47,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.

6
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:48,554
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, Jamie?

7
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:49,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Warm.

8
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:50,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Warm, yeah.

9
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:56,256
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not quite as horrid, the temperature this week, but we still are combating some issues here in California.

10
00:00:56,837 --> 00:01:00,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just the heat, but the smoke was terrible, like Wednesday or Thursday.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

12
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:04,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I am making use of consumer reports.

13
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:06,264
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like a volcano erupted.

14
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:06,704
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that?

15
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:13,489
[SPEAKER_04]: To look for air conditioners or another idea I have is an evaporative air cooler.

16
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:14,597
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,364
[SPEAKER_10]: And because I didn't want to comb my hair anymore.

18
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:45,439
[SPEAKER_10]: It gets to the point where it's like, okay, I can't do anything with this, so I'm going to have to shave it off.

19
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:47,868
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:17,352
[SPEAKER_09]: The Madness for E3 starts tomorrow, so it kind of defeats the purpose of uploading a show mid-week because everything will be outdated.

21
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:20,413
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to try and have something up on the feed mid-week.

22
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:22,273
[SPEAKER_09]: It just depends if we can all get together at once.

23
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:23,754
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

24
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:24,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Some more to come on that.

25
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:32,116
[SPEAKER_09]: But for now, we're only going to have one big show for you guys here, but all the segments you know and love, Classic Game of the Week, Mailbag, all that good stuff, and your calls.

26
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:36,237
[SPEAKER_09]: And chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

27
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:39,178
[SPEAKER_09]: And tonight, they're talking about Fire.

28
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:41,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says the show is on fire.

29
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says my hair is on fire.

30
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,019
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

31
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's on fire.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,641
[SPEAKER_09]: You're all flaming tonight in chat at Orange Lounge Radio.

33
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've made a decision.

34
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:51,022
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

35
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:52,502
[SPEAKER_04]: What might best suit our needs.

36
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:53,082
[SPEAKER_09]: The cooler?

37
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: A swamp cooler.

38
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:54,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

39
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it actually might work.

40
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:57,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's cheaper than a portable air conditioning unit.

41
00:02:58,164 --> 00:02:58,464
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

42
00:02:58,764 --> 00:02:59,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Be more cost effective.

43
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,345
[SPEAKER_04]: This is economics on Orange Lounge Radio.

44
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:04,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Save money.

45
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:04,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Use less energy.

46
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:05,306
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

47
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:07,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about all the money you blew games on this week.

48
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:08,107
[SPEAKER_09]: And how was your gaming week?

49
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I played DDR.

50
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:11,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

51
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:15,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the Supernova machine at the movie theater and I wanted to die.

52
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:21,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wearing my sandals so first of all I didn't have the right shoes and then I tried to do shit that was way too hard.

53
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,010
[SPEAKER_09]: But at least you got up there and played.

54
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sort of.

55
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:31,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I know if I play I am way, way out of practice so that's my issue.

56
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:33,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I want to try a Supernova 2 machine someday.

57
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:53,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I dusted off my Super Nintendo cartridge of something that I will be speaking of later in the show Awesome How about now, you are an iPhone user Yes, I did download some iPhone games You got the new 2.0 firmware for your existing iPhone, right?

58
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did Okay, gotcha

59
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:57,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me give the name of the game real quick.

60
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I haven't played a whole lot of it.

61
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:05,618
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a free game for everyone who has an iPhone or an iPod Touch.

62
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:07,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's called Aurora Faint.

63
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:15,287
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically plays like Bejeweled, but you have a leveling system in it.

64
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:16,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty cool.

65
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Puzzle Quest-ish, kind of?

66
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:19,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

67
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I also downloaded the Stalker program.

68
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:24,643
[SPEAKER_09]: What, pray tell, is the stalker program?

69
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:25,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Whirl.

70
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:26,844
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that work?

71
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:32,347
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, for everyone who's got it, it keeps track of restaurants and places you like to go so that you know where your friends like to hang out.

72
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:33,968
[SPEAKER_09]: That is kind of scary.

73
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,369
[SPEAKER_09]: What a world we're living in.

74
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:40,291
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, though, about this whole application thing on the new iPhone?

75
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:43,773
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the fact that people can create their own games and applications and all this stuff.

76
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:44,634
[SPEAKER_04]: About damn time.

77
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:46,203
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

78
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:09,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think another company will try to... Because I noticed, what is that other phone?

79
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:12,717
[SPEAKER_09]: The Instinct is supposed to work a lot like the iPhone.

80
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:15,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you now the LG one is shit.

81
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:20,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at that and I go, it's not going to really be able to penetrate the marketplace the way that Apple has, I don't think.

82
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:22,001
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just my personal thought.

83
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,223
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going to help Apple is marketing to other providers.

84
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:27,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what else is cool.

85
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I was hearing a little bit about it on Bobby's show.

86
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:37,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know much about this, but apparently there's some type of program you can get, some app you can get that you can listen to internet radio through that Edge network.

87
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,721
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can listen to All Games Radio or our show anywhere you go.

88
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:46,845
[SPEAKER_09]: People have it hooked up so that if you have one of those systems where you can play your iPod through the car, you could listen to All Games Radio like it's a car.

89
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost downloaded it, but I have to move off my photos before I put more apps on there.

90
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:55,150
[SPEAKER_04]: The stuff that I downloaded so far, let me grab my phone and take a look real quick.

91
00:05:56,003 --> 00:06:00,743
[SPEAKER_09]: blah live radio, she's literally opening up the phone

92
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:09,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded AIM, Aurora Faint, Twitterific, Whirl, and Epocrates prescription.

93
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:22,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Epocrates is actually kind of a cool little program that if you have, say that you find like an unidentified pill and you want to know what it is, then you can enter in the pill's description including serial numbers that are on the pill.

94
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:22,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

95
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll look it up and show you a picture of it so you can compare it.

96
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:28,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, if I take this, will I hallucinate?

97
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby spoke up in chat.

98
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:34,032
[SPEAKER_09]: He says it's called Tuner is the name of the program you're going to want to check out.

99
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:35,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'll download it right now.

100
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:35,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

101
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,554
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have a cost.

102
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:36,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

103
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:39,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

104
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:40,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments from chat.

105
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:44,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Robert M., my iTunes is showing the applications menu in place of games.

106
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the iPod 5th generation video though.

107
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Same thing happened to me.

108
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Pagel and some of the other games they've released for iPod and they now are applications that run on your iPod.

109
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, they don't have a lot of them but that's what happened to the old games.

110
00:06:58,686 --> 00:06:59,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I checked out Tuner and Tuner is $5

111
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,777
[SPEAKER_09]: 4.99 to be specific.

112
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:19,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

113
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:19,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.

114
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:20,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $5.

115
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:25,219
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to get it after I have money.

116
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:25,959
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

117
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded a bunch of free shit, though, and it was really cool.

118
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I can look up drugs at work.

119
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And AIM, I can use AIM at work.

120
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:34,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Free is awesome.

121
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Hells yeah.

122
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:37,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's yours.

123
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

124
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:41,456
[SPEAKER_10]: It was full of hamburger.

125
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, because I'm eating a hamburger, that's why.

126
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

127
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,203
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not just a hamburger, that is a bacon and cheese I see in there.

128
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:49,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Double bacon cheeseburger.

129
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, an artery killer right there.

130
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:55,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's because, I don't know, fast food hamburgers are pretty tiny.

131
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:58,514
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you get a hamburger, it's like a cracker.

132
00:07:59,255 --> 00:07:59,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Gotcha.

133
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,358
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is two crackers and...

134
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:03,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, bacon.

135
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:06,803
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, Jamie, Bobby is recommending Tap Tap Revenge and says it's free.

136
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:11,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw it and I looked at it, but I don't think I would play it that much.

137
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Free, Jamie, free.

138
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:15,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if it's free, then you gotta play it.

139
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:16,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Yaris.

140
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:18,015
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta try Yaris at least once.

141
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I also, though, am trying to be conservative for space because I really do like to take a lot of useless pictures with my phone.

142
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,224
[SPEAKER_09]: That she does.

143
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:25,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I can attest to that.

144
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,686
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go out to Indian Food and she takes pictures of the food.

145
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:28,306
[SPEAKER_04]: And my beer.

146
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:29,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Takes pictures of his eating, her beer.

147
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:30,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry.

148
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:31,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your gaming week.

149
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:31,848
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

150
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:33,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Grand Theft Auto 4.

151
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,009
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty much it.

152
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been busy.

153
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,551
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll get into that.

154
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:39,671
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get into that in a little while.

155
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:41,112
[SPEAKER_09]: But Grand Theft Auto is still fun.

156
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:42,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Still a lot of people playing it.

157
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:43,413
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still fun.

158
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've just been playing the work games.

159
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:49,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do our four-player deathmatch because the fifth machine is still broken.

160
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,657
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes the replayability of that game so awesome?

161
00:08:51,877 --> 00:09:02,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the new thing that we're doing now is we've changed the settings a little bit so that the only blip that shows up on the radar is whoever's in first, and everyone else is invisible.

162
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,080
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're running around, and then whoever is in the lead, you can find them, but the other players you can't find.

163
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,282
[SPEAKER_10]: So the person in the lead doesn't see people bearing down on them in cars and stuff like that.

164
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:14,722
[SPEAKER_10]: So it makes it really...

165
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:19,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Really intense, actually, because everyone's kind of going after the leader at the same time.

166
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:19,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

167
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:21,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments from chat room.

168
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:25,408
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Naaman Lights says, I'm using Tuner on iTouch.

169
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:32,433
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's that iPod that's not quite, it's the iPhone without the phone, the iTouch, which also got the upgrade to use all the apps.

170
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:33,393
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

171
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:35,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, other comments from chat.

172
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:40,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Shaoran said, there used to be a double bacon with a really long name that a friend of mine called a Satan Burger.

173
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:42,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

174
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,735
[SPEAKER_09]: We're turning into Orange Lounge video.

175
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:46,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so Grantheth out of four was Loki's game of the week.

176
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:46,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much.

177
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:48,077
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get to the rest of it in a little bit.

178
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:51,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself, I also have not been playing a lot of new stuff.

179
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:52,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of the same old stuff.

180
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,240
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Raiding and WoW.

181
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero 2.

182
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I went back and played Guitar Hero 2 this week and Guitar Hero 3.

183
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,542
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I talked about this a couple weeks ago.

184
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:05,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm finally learning with my fingers how to hit those notes without necessarily strumming.

185
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:08,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the difference between the notes that you don't have to strum if you get the note before it.

186
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember what exactly they called that.

187
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:13,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure somebody in chat will correct me, but the whole... Hammer-ons?

188
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:13,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a hammer-ons?

189
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm finally learning how to do that better.

190
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:15,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that either.

191
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:17,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, hell, I'm still playing three keys, okay?

192
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was able to go back to Guitar Hero 2 and 3.

193
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually beat the Living Color song in Guitar Hero 3.

194
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:26,432
[SPEAKER_09]: I five-started my first... Cult of Personality, right?

195
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I five-started my first time on Hard.

196
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:28,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Not Expert.

197
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:31,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not quite there yet, but for me, that was a freaking accomplishment.

198
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:33,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so excited, because that song was not easy.

199
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:36,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I was excited when I beat that freaking...

200
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:38,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Slipknot Song

201
00:10:53,985 --> 00:11:03,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because, I mean, you know, the whole curving bullets thing in there, the way they kind of like swing their gun out or whatever to curve the bullet, you could totally do that with like a Wii Remote or something.

202
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:10,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you could, it, I don't understand why anyone hasn't come up with this idea, like, to make this movie into a game, because it would be pretty awesome.

203
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:13,383
[SPEAKER_10]: But the Matrix was supposed to be an awesome game too.

204
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, okay.

205
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:18,608
[SPEAKER_10]: After watching this movie, you're just like, why the fuck did this guy not direct the Matrix?

206
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:22,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I swear to God, if he directed the sequels, we wouldn't have an issue.

207
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:24,113
[SPEAKER_10]: There'd be like 50 sequels to this damn movie.

208
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's seriously so much better.

209
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,638
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Russian guy who did Nightwatch and Daywatch.

210
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:28,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

211
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:31,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to hold the Matrix pretty high up there for actions.

212
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:34,043
[SPEAKER_10]: It's borderline.

213
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:35,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Keanu Reeves kind of brings it down there, but...

214
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:41,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Action-wise, it was pretty kick-ass, but oh my god, the wanted is so much better.

215
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Sub-Z in chat says, curved bullet is so unrealistic.

216
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:46,394
[SPEAKER_10]: It is, that's the point.

217
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:52,575
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't go in there expecting a realistic espionage film, right?

218
00:11:53,196 --> 00:12:00,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, these assassins or whatever have the ability to control adrenaline really well to the point where they can do superhuman things.

219
00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:02,177
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the whole premise of this.

220
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:04,598
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a superhero film, right?

221
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of.

222
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:14,191
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really that superhuman, but like Matrix stuff, where they can slow down time, their perspective of it, super strength and stuff like that.

223
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:17,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my other quick questions about Wanted, and then we'll go back to games from movies.

224
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:19,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there tits in the movie?

225
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:19,979
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

226
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:21,000
[SPEAKER_09]: No tits?! !

227
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,400
[SPEAKER_09]: No tits.

228
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Any drug usage?

229
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:25,722
[SPEAKER_09]: There's lots of blood, lots of killing.

230
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,503
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just fine, because I'm looking for the trifecta of sex, drugs, and violence.

231
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,064
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no tits, so you don't have sex.

232
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:31,285
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no drugs, it sounds like?

233
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:32,786
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a good twist in the plot.

234
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,887
[SPEAKER_09]: A good twist that you don't see coming.

235
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:35,687
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a twist.

236
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:36,868
[SPEAKER_04]: What a twist.

237
00:12:36,908 --> 00:12:39,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have Nookie without boobs, Rob.

238
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:40,548
[SPEAKER_09]: TNA-T

239
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Just A. Alright.

240
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:14,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it's supposed to be unrealistic, but it's not... It's basically... It's kind of like The Matrix, where it's sort of grounded in... Okay, I want to say it's really grounded in the real world, but it takes place in a world that could sort of be realistic, and then there's people doing unrealistic things in it.

241
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:19,367
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sort of like that, but it's not as ridiculous and ridiculous as...

242
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:20,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

243
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:37,969
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

244
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:55,310
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

245
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,410
[SPEAKER_09]: to get a total domination victory over my opponents in the game.

246
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:28,312
[SPEAKER_09]: The only kind of little bitch I have in the game that I think would get to me if I was coming from the PC to the console, and I think you've probably heard this a lot of other places and it's true, you don't get to customize your game a lot.

247
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:34,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in Civ IV, you can customize the world you're playing on and when you start and how the world looks and the size.

248
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:35,754
[SPEAKER_09]: You can customize all that stuff in advance.

249
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:39,975
[SPEAKER_09]: In Civ Revolution, you already kind of start with one city built and that's it.

250
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:41,376
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't get to customize a whole lot of that.

251
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:41,936
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

252
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:49,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping though, maybe with some download stuff later on, 2K and Firaxis can remedy that.

253
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,843
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a minor bitch in the scope of things, because I think the game is still pretty cool.

254
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:57,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little surprised it's not on the arcade.

255
00:14:57,984 --> 00:15:02,087
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot that they're doing in this game that requires, I would think, the usage of a DVD.

256
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:03,627
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

257
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's one of those games where it's never quite the same game twice.

258
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:25,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's many different ways to accomplish the goal, many different civilizations you can play.

259
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:30,445
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do recommend it, especially if you're a fan of it on the PC and you want to kind of check it out.

260
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:33,267
[SPEAKER_09]: But just know you're not getting a port of Civ IV.

261
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:38,832
[SPEAKER_09]: You're getting a whole new Civ-like game that's dumbed down slightly for consoles.

262
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,353
[SPEAKER_09]: But sometimes dumbed down can be a good thing.

263
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:43,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Prowler says in chat there, simplified can be a good thing.

264
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rama says in chat, Rob is a Civ fanboy.

265
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:46,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course he's going to love it.

266
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:47,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah.

267
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:56,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'd say I love it, like I love the original Civilization, I love Civ IV, but I like it a lot so far.

268
00:15:57,684 --> 00:15:58,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see about that.

269
00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:01,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

270
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:09,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, just to kind of put it out there, we are only doing a Part A tonight and that has to do with the whole E3 and things being outdated.

271
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,151
[SPEAKER_09]: However...

272
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:11,859
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some good news.

273
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we're not bitter at all about not being able to go to E3.

274
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:17,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, no one invited us to the cool kids party.

275
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:19,704
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not bitter at all about not being able to go.

276
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:20,104
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

277
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:22,486
[SPEAKER_10]: My work got an invite, but they didn't go.

278
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:24,387
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, oh, we don't want to take it.

279
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:24,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't want to go.

280
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:27,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been interested in going since they changed it.

281
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I hear there's no lines and any of that stuff anymore.

282
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:35,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just want to go to hang out with the cool kids, but apparently we are not part of that clique.

283
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:36,316
[SPEAKER_09]: But the hell with them.

284
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,962
[SPEAKER_09]: We are starting E3 right now.

285
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:41,643
[SPEAKER_09]: We're starting E3 right now.

286
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:50,427
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 begins right now on this very radio show that you are listening to with our very own OLR E3 press conference.

287
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,287
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're all invited.

288
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:03,064
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, and we have our own E3 surprises in store for you tonight.

289
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:06,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So the official OLR E3 press conference.

290
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:08,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Blah, blah, blah.

291
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:13,154
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had wonderful support from all of our listeners over the past six years of our existence.

292
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:14,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Blah, blah, blah.

293
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:18,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Our show is still making no money at all, but it's sure fun to listen to and do.

294
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Blah, blah, blah.

295
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's get to the good stuff.

296
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:22,603
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 won't have us, then F you!

297
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,471
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

298
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:01,496
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time.

299
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

300
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:37,271
[SPEAKER_09]: That's three hours on Friday starting at 4 Pacific, three hours on Saturday starting at 4 Pacific, and two hours on Sunday starting at 4 Pacific as well.

301
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:41,816
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole thing's gonna be moderated by Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy that precedes us here on Orange Lounge Radio.

302
00:18:42,236 --> 00:18:43,317
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be a part of that.

303
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:44,677
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be kind of on and off of there.

304
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:50,660
[SPEAKER_09]: We might do our own podcast from the site to supplement it, but we'll be live as a part of this on All Games Radio.

305
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,381
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just us.

306
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:57,044
[SPEAKER_09]: DMN, your old pal from our network as well as Under Station Live, he's going to be there.

307
00:18:57,464 --> 00:18:58,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby's there.

308
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Super happy fun time show.

309
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:06,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Dead Pixel Live, Electric Sisterhood, Game Addict Hotline, Chatterbox, Evil Avatar, all there, all represented at Penny Arcade Expo.

310
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,290
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the freaking Voltron of independent podcasting.

311
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Live.

312
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:13,092
[SPEAKER_09]: August 29th, 30th, and 31st in Seattle.

313
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:18,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can't be there in person, you can still listen to The Madness on allgames.com.

314
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:19,514
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be awesome.

315
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:24,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby would like to clarify it is not in the exhibit hall, but it's still within the convention center.

316
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:25,896
[SPEAKER_09]: So there it is.

317
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:30,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And the OLR PAX broadcast will also be podcasted.

318
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:34,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby will let you know when our segment is that we're going to be on it.

319
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:37,079
[SPEAKER_09]: It's apparently going to be its own special podcast.

320
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,560
[SPEAKER_09]: So stay tuned to allgames.com for more information on that.

321
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:41,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Second announcement.

322
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:45,479
[SPEAKER_09]: You asked for it, you got it.

323
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,540
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do it.

324
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:54,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that Part B has been very delayed lately throughout the week in getting pushed to the podcast feed, so we're going to try something new.

325
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't say that OLR doesn't listen to the listeners.

326
00:19:56,885 --> 00:20:01,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting with next week's show, Part A and B will be released as one giant show.

327
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:04,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Parts A and B combined into one giant show.

328
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:10,252
[SPEAKER_09]: and we will have something that kind of even runs in between the shows when you're listening to them on the podcast.

329
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:18,138
[SPEAKER_09]: It will not be the show itself but probably promos for other shows and other fun things that we want to try doing with the podcast.

330
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:22,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of these joke ads and things that we were talking about we're going to kind of start to get our feet wet with that.

331
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:30,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So starting next week parts A and B combined in one part so you no longer have to wait until like Friday or Saturday to hear the whole thing.

332
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:34,789
[SPEAKER_09]: You will get to download it Monday at the latest which will be pretty awesome.

333
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:41,414
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, and the third announcement, and my favorite, is really awesome.

334
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:45,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, why don't you tell the listeners a little more about this, what you've been working on for the past few weeks.

335
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and unfortunately, I wish I could say that I was done, but I'm not.

336
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:54,905
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay, because at E3, you sometimes tease things that aren't coming out until Christmas, and this should be out a lot sooner than that.

337
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:56,606
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to be until Christmas.

338
00:20:57,026 --> 00:20:57,967
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely hope that.

339
00:20:58,427 --> 00:20:59,908
[SPEAKER_10]: I worked my ass off for the last...

340
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:03,572
[SPEAKER_10]: The brand new OLR PSP All Games Radio Streamer, which is gonna be...

341
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:19,969
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

342
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:43,913
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me reiterate, because I saw the draft of what this looks like, and you're going to be posting screenshots to Orange Ones Radio a little later on, right?

343
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:44,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

344
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:51,076
[SPEAKER_09]: This is actually, the way it looks in your PSP, it is not something, you don't even have to go to olrpsp.com in your browser.

345
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:55,638
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like an application loaded in there, like the other radio station listeners.

346
00:21:55,918 --> 00:22:02,321
[SPEAKER_09]: You click it, it takes you to a live radio feed that is broadcasting all games radio.

347
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:03,922
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the part that Bobby didn't even know about.

348
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:09,886
[SPEAKER_09]: It even is taking that little box with the times of the upcoming shows from the website and showing that as part of the player.

349
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:10,607
[SPEAKER_09]: It is awesome.

350
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:16,511
[SPEAKER_10]: And then other things are going to be included with that.

351
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:18,872
[SPEAKER_10]: All the RSS feeds are going to be in there as well.

352
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:24,456
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be able to listen to podcasts from all the different shows and stuff.

353
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,937
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be able to select through that stuff.

354
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Details on all the other shows on all games.

355
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:35,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's... I mean, there's a lot of small things I'm working on right now, unfortunately.

356
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:49,467
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um... Yeah, IRC chat on the PSP, I tried... I even tried buying the PSP IRC script, and the guy is a douchebag and won't fucking sell it, even for a lot of money, but, uh... I think you're supposed to say douchebag in an E3 press conference.

357
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:50,528
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright, that's alright.

358
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Breaking new ground here, you douchebags.

359
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:53,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

360
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:57,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, and then I'm going to have some more download stuff as well.

361
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:03,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to work on a theme and stuff, but seriously, I've been in my computer room forever.

362
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:08,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I will post some screenshots, though, into chat so you can see a few screenshots I've taken.

363
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:13,718
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's still a work in progress, and I'm hopefully going to have it done very soon.

364
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Prowler in chatroom says, this is already better than last year's Microsoft press conference.

365
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:20,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you.

366
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:21,422
[SPEAKER_09]: We try.

367
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:25,764
[SPEAKER_09]: So any estimated time on when this is going to be out, like before the end of the month, August-ish?

368
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:29,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping before the end of next week, but we'll see.

369
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:30,487
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

370
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:33,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and you've even posted a link of what one of the screenshots looks like to chat.

371
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:34,709
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be awesome.

372
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there's two coming.

373
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:37,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

374
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So our live listeners get to see it.

375
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:44,703
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you listening on the taped podcast, you can look at those on our forums quite soon.

376
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:46,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Those will be up very soon on our forums.

377
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:47,265
[SPEAKER_09]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

378
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:48,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on forums.

379
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:50,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so that does it.

380
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:53,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, to reiterate our three points of this year's E3 press conference.

381
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:55,679
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 won't have us, so to hell with them.

382
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:57,220
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to PAX and it's going to be even better.

383
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:11,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Part A and B will be combined starting next week with the podcast and the olrpsp.com new website and radio tuner application that takes you direct to allgames.com radio feed coming soon.

384
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:25,780
[SPEAKER_10]: The PSP sucks and it doesn't, you know, unfortunately it takes a fucking long time to put pages on there because you make it in a program for the PC, you view it on your PC and it looks nice and you take it to your PSP and it looks like shit, so...

385
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:28,709
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a long process.

386
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:29,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

387
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:35,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anyhow, we are going to shift gears and get into our regular show tonight.

388
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:38,477
[SPEAKER_09]: As if a press conference wasn't enough, we have a whole regular show to get to.

389
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:40,098
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is tonight's gaming news.

390
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,220
[SPEAKER_09]: And Loki, once again, starting us off with tonight's gaming news.

391
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:42,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

392
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:51,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is not a big surprise, but Konami has launched a patent suit against Harmonix and MTV over Rock Band.

393
00:24:52,828 --> 00:24:52,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

394
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:55,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

395
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:03,977
[SPEAKER_10]: There's definitely, I guess, some merit to it, seeing as it looks very similar to Guitar Freak's Drum Mania, the whole setup.

396
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:06,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just surprised that it took them this long.

397
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:14,407
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, maybe they're not licensing the technology like Guitar Hero is, so...

398
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:18,712
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's the case, you know, I do think Konami's owed some money.

399
00:25:18,932 --> 00:25:21,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Although it is kind of cheap to do that and then release their game.

400
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:24,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, their game looks like a cheap knockoff of Rock Band.

401
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:28,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it's just... I wish they had done this a lot sooner.

402
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:33,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, put out their game instead of just bitching about the other games coming out.

403
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:36,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Katamari's Forever in chat says, Confusing lawsuit is confusing.

404
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,520
[SPEAKER_09]: It is kind of in-depth.

405
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,661
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it that Konami is specifically taking issue?

406
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:42,842
[SPEAKER_09]: The way I understood it, it kind of has to do with the controller.

407
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:50,704
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not necessarily so much the game itself, but it seems to be the fact that it's a guitar controller very similar to what Guitar Freaks was when it was out here in the U.S.

408
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:54,166
[SPEAKER_09]: in very small arcade test markets a long time ago.

409
00:25:54,226 --> 00:25:55,326
[SPEAKER_09]: That's their point of contention.

410
00:25:55,946 --> 00:25:58,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and they do have the patents in place for it.

411
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:03,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm sure they do because it's been out for years now, so...

412
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean they're in the right there to defend their patent.

413
00:26:08,021 --> 00:26:09,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't understand why they didn't defend it

414
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:18,420
[SPEAKER_10]: When Rock Band first came out, I guess now that they figure there's money involved in it and they can make a lot of money off of it, then yeah, they should do it.

415
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:27,725
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, I kind of wish that they were just leading the music gaming industry instead of just trying to follow and just make money off of lawsuits.

416
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:34,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Because now their new game, which to be honest, I don't really care too much about, and it looks kind of cheap.

417
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,290
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

418
00:26:37,714 --> 00:27:01,376
[SPEAKER_09]: personally I think it kind of stinks because you know obviously I enjoy rock band but it's kind of one of those things in the back of my mind I kind of always wondered you know if Konami sued those folks that did in the groove I'm kind of surprised they never tried to go after rock band and then especially after hearing that Activision's already been paying them under the table for quite some time for the you know the whole Guitar Hero thing and you know Red Octane and Konami have had a long relationship and

419
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:18,378
[SPEAKER_09]: and then I kind of thought well maybe part of the reason this took so long to happen is because Harmonix and Konami have had somewhat of a long relationship too with the whole karaoke revolution thing but you know the whole timing of this lawsuit is awfully odd with their games coming out this year and everything and I think it kind of stinks but at the same time

420
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:20,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, there might be some merit to it.

421
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope it doesn't stop Rock Band.

422
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,991
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, we called it too.

423
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:45,933
[SPEAKER_09]: We said Konami's going to sue these folks when they try to invade the home market.

424
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:50,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And sure enough, when that In The Groove game came out for PS2, that's when Konami sicked the bulldogs on them.

425
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:55,637
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does make this whole thing interesting that Rock Band's been out for like a year, year and a half.

426
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:58,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, does it, well, not quite a year and a half, but about a year.

427
00:27:58,238 --> 00:28:00,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, does it take that long for a lawsuit to get rolling?

428
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,843
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's just they want to see how successful it is now that it's finally come around and they're going to be putting out their sequel and stuff.

429
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:14,347
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, do you have any thoughts on this?

430
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:16,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know you tweeted some stuff earlier in the week.

431
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious kind of where your thought is at this point in time with the whole suit.

432
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:33,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's petty and ridiculous they had their chance when and you know it's funny remember talking to Jason Anis all those years ago about trying to bring Bit Money into the U.S.

433
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:44,442
[SPEAKER_04]: and working on getting Guitar Freaks and everything they had their chance and they had their advocate then did they hop on it no so someone came along and did it better

434
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:46,494
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

435
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:54,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're speaking a lot of the same things that the music game community is saying, is that there's this round of disappointment in Konami.

436
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:59,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, they had all these... This Beatmania series in Japan was awesome.

437
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:00,895
[SPEAKER_09]: The 2DX series...

438
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:01,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

439
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:03,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar freaks, drum mania, people loved it.

440
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:05,258
[SPEAKER_09]: People were importing that stuff.

441
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:07,580
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody was asking, why aren't you bringing it out here?

442
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Why aren't you bringing it out here?

443
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:16,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And it took one of their own people on the USA side, Jason, to twist the fucking arm of the Japanese side.

444
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:17,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And we barely got DDR.

445
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And you barely got DDR.

446
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:21,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And then DDR was a huge success.

447
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:24,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember how shitty that first mix of DDR was.

448
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:25,512
[SPEAKER_04]: But everyone wanted it.

449
00:29:25,572 --> 00:29:26,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone was happy.

450
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:47,417
[SPEAKER_09]: and then it would just cause a landslide to DDR after that and look how successful it's been and then you know Beatmania 2DX the problem was they didn't learn from their mistakes they released a kind of a shoddy 2DX mix I mean they took some risks with it which were kind of cool at the whole five key thing but it just wasn't enough they didn't take enough risks with licensing that's where Guitar Hero and Rock Band whooped them is that they knew what

451
00:29:47,597 --> 00:29:50,079
[SPEAKER_09]: What the American audience wanted and they went for it.

452
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:59,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sorry if this offends you, otaku folks and anime folks and J-pop loving folks that like the Bomani songs that are in the 2DX.

453
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:02,147
[SPEAKER_09]: But all of those songs would never have worked here.

454
00:30:02,847 --> 00:30:05,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of proven by the 2DX release over here.

455
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:07,570
[SPEAKER_09]: It needed more.

456
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:11,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And that crappy cover of Toxic and one Moby song, that wasn't enough.

457
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:13,734
[SPEAKER_09]: It needed like half and half at least.

458
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:16,496
[SPEAKER_09]: It needed more songs that could have reached out to the American audience.

459
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,137
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyhow.

460
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:31,325
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but my question is, despite the kind of resentment we almost feel towards Konami for not taking the freaking risk sooner and now looking almost like a copycat with this whole Rock Revolution thing, does it make it right, though?

461
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:34,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it make it still that their lawsuit doesn't have any ground to stand on?

462
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:38,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as disappointed as I am in Konami, I still go, but they have a point.

463
00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:41,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

464
00:30:41,783 --> 00:30:42,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Any thoughts on that?

465
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:46,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you still think it's petty?

466
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:47,747
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still petty.

467
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:49,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still petty.

468
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:52,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, the format, I think, is so different.

469
00:30:56,513 --> 00:31:04,719
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that has to be is whether or not they actually did, in effect, go and re-engineer what Konami had done.

470
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,623
[SPEAKER_04]: How long was the trademark out for their controllers?

471
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:13,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And plus, I think Red Octane knew what they were doing when they originally put out Guitar Hero.

472
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:14,786
[SPEAKER_09]: They knew what they were doing.

473
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why there's those under-the-table payments.

474
00:31:18,248 --> 00:31:18,888
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're calling it.

475
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:19,489
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what I mean.

476
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:21,850
[SPEAKER_09]: To Konami.

477
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:25,713
[SPEAKER_09]: But Harmonix should have known what they were getting into as well.

478
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:27,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love Harmonix.

479
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:29,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Harmonix makes some great games.

480
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:30,435
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what kind of makes this disappointing.

481
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,557
[SPEAKER_09]: But they kind of should have known that this might happen.

482
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:34,518
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just kind of disappointing.

483
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:37,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

484
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:41,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Going off some comments from chat, because I'm sure there's a lot of folks in chat.

485
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:46,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Gerardimo says, 2DX was based on the assumption that only DDR players had heard of would be playing this.

486
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:48,590
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why just about all the songs on it are in DDR.

487
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:52,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of, but they really pushed Beatmania at E3.

488
00:31:52,112 --> 00:32:03,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it was their big title, but then the title itself, by the time it comes out, I mean, God, remember that G4 clip where they were calling it a Guitar Hero knockoff and all the Bimani fanboys were getting angry?

489
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:04,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

490
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:08,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And then some talk as well in chat about the whole MTV drumscape thing.

491
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:11,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Shouldn't MTV already have some type of patents on drums because of drumscape?

492
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:15,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, even if they have patents on drums, they may not have patents on guitar, and I think that's Konami's issue.

493
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:17,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think Konami was doing anything about the drums.

494
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:18,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

495
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:22,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, Konami could be sued by the creators of several of the MIDI guitars, too.

496
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Gibson.

497
00:32:25,258 --> 00:32:34,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but... Well, Konami's guitars, when they first came out, they didn't really resemble any type of real, you know, form of guitar.

498
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:38,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fairly, I'd say, an innocent design, if you know what I mean.

499
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:38,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

500
00:32:39,143 --> 00:32:39,363
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

501
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:48,699
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, the MIDI guitars, especially ones that have worked on Switch like that, have existed for, you know, since the 80s at least.

502
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:54,931
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru in chat says, if Immersion could win against Sony, Konami can win against EA.

503
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:58,152
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's going to be settled out of court one way or another.

504
00:32:58,652 --> 00:32:58,972
[SPEAKER_09]: I think.

505
00:32:58,992 --> 00:33:00,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what's going to happen.

506
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:03,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it doesn't prevent Rock Band 2 or delay it any further.

507
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:04,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it will.

508
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:05,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't think it will either.

509
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:06,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it'll settle out of court.

510
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:09,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're going to have to make those payments similar to what Activision is doing.

511
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:11,297
[SPEAKER_09]: But the problem is, Konami...

512
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:13,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

513
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:34,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock Revolution focuses more on drums, not guitar.

514
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:34,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Including keyboard.

515
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:00,801
[SPEAKER_10]: It focuses on everything.

516
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:06,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock band, they have solid vocals, they have solid guitars and drums, tracks.

517
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:08,163
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just one or the other.

518
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:09,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

519
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, more to come on this as the weeks go by.

520
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:20,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure we'll hear about the settlement very soon or at least some type of further comment from Harmonix and Viacom and all those people outside of this is stupid.

521
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:34,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, speaking of Konami and their music games, DDR is still trekking along, and Dance Dance Revolution X is the new game that is coming out on the PlayStation 2 later this year, and there's more DDR games coming out for the home consoles.

522
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,696
[SPEAKER_09]: But what might have surprised some people, this is also going to be an arcade port.

523
00:34:38,997 --> 00:34:41,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Dance Dance Revolution X will be coming to the arcades, and...

524
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:43,499
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a whole new cabinet.

525
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,760
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like it's actually something on a widescreen monitor.

526
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:55,986
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some pictures that have been posted over at BomaniStyle.com, which I believe came from that ZenisaiVanisher site of an actual new cabinet and what it looks like.

527
00:34:56,467 --> 00:35:00,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the names have been changed, like Beginner Mode is Starter Mode, Advanced Mode, Course Mode.

528
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:07,833
[SPEAKER_09]: There's now Shock Arrows in the game, which is basically mines, although I seem to recall DDR has had Poison Arrows before.

529
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,134
[SPEAKER_09]: It was in one of the Ultramix games.

530
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:09,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Go back and look.

531
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:10,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

532
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,057
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also going to be the link feature.

533
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:16,220
[SPEAKER_09]: USB cards will now handle edit data.

534
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:17,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet!

535
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, edit data is coming back to the DDR series thanks to a USB memory cord.

536
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:25,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently, good edit data is going to go worldwide on e-amusement.

537
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:30,145
[SPEAKER_09]: The most commonly played stuff will be back in the game.

538
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Older songs possibly making a comeback.

539
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:44,430
[SPEAKER_09]: 60 plus new songs including licenses and new originals and developers say that they are committed to putting 1.5 times the amount of new content in future mixes.

540
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And another thing I believe I was hearing about this, Betson is now not involved in this.

541
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:50,013
[SPEAKER_09]: They were doing the cabinets for Supernova.

542
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:52,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they are not involved in this any longer.

543
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:53,834
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be part of the reason.

544
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:55,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure though about all the changes.

545
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:59,517
[SPEAKER_09]: More information to come when these machines start being spotted out there in the wild.

546
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:02,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami's still trying to do stuff with their DDR series.

547
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.

548
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:10,606
[SPEAKER_10]: At least one of those tracks is probably going to be pretty good.

549
00:36:11,526 --> 00:36:15,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And now there's folks saying that the Poison Arrows thing is taken from in the groove.

550
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:24,036
[SPEAKER_09]: But correct me if I'm wrong, in one of the early, early DDR games, like Second Mix or some crap, wasn't there a mode where there were arrows that you weren't supposed to step on?

551
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:28,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought in one of the earlier DDR mixes there was something like that.

552
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:30,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

553
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I think maybe in the challenge mode there was something like that.

554
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was also the one where you weren't supposed to step on any arrows that weren't currently up on the screen.

555
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well, I don't think it's anything that surprising, honestly.

556
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:46,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I didn't really call to mind things that much innovation in the first place.

557
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:55,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, it was something new, but it didn't exactly reinvent the game, so I don't think it's that big a deal that Konami's kind of putting it in this new game.

558
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of think they're a little dumb anyway.

559
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:01,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they don't overuse them, but we'll see.

560
00:37:01,944 --> 00:37:03,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So, coming to arcades soon.

561
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:22,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something that makes me happy in particular, and this makes me uber happy, is that there is going to be another Sega Aegis PS2 release that is the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection, which was...

562
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:29,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think Fantasy Zone 2 DX before, but hey, it's more Fantasy Zone.

563
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:35,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope it's actually done up like the Sega Ages one that I already have on PS2.

564
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:41,728
[SPEAKER_04]: It was part of the Sega Ages 2500 set, which was named that because it was 2,500 yen per

565
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:59,163
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is supposed to be, from what this says on here, Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2, Fantasy Zone Gear, Super Fantasy Zone, Opa Opa Galactic Protector, Fantasy Zone 2 Remake, and the Sega Ages 2500 Volume 3 Fantasy Zone version.

566
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like a lot of Fantasy Zone.

567
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:04,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Get ready.

568
00:38:04,027 --> 00:38:06,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like do want, because I think I actually have most of these.

569
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:11,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if Opa Opa was Fantasy Zone 3 The Maze.

570
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:15,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if there's some updated graphics and sound and all that's usually a good thing.

571
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I want an Opa Opa.

572
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,015
[SPEAKER_09]: A little plushie or something?

573
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:21,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I do want one.

574
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:22,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows, maybe they'll be showing this.

575
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:24,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I should cosplay the Opa Opa one year.

576
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:27,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll show this at Tokyo Game Show or something, a little more in it.

577
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:27,777
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

578
00:38:28,657 --> 00:38:35,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you this story, Rob, but one time I was trying to look for the Opa Opa music and ended up downloading a happy song in Greek.

579
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Opa Opa.

580
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that means, like, yay in Greek.

581
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:40,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

582
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:42,935
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it was a better song than Carameldansen.

583
00:38:43,075 --> 00:38:43,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that's for sure.

584
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:44,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, yes, it is.

585
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:45,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, all right.

586
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:51,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Fantasy Zone is still a ways out, but we have some stuff coming out a lot sooner than that, right, Loki?

587
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:51,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

588
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:57,778
[SPEAKER_10]: This week, there's some pretty interesting stuff coming out, actually, especially if you like football.

589
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:08,760
[SPEAKER_10]: There's NCAA March Madness, NCAA Football 09, and that's coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and the PSP.

590
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:23,399
[SPEAKER_10]: and also there is a game based off the looks like crap movie but Space Chimps that will be out on PC, Playstation 2, the Wii and I believe the 360 and DS.

591
00:39:27,022 --> 00:39:31,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Hunting Unlimited 2009 coming to the PC.

592
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:32,764
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like shit as well.

593
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:37,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Code Lyoko Quest for Infinity on PSP.

594
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:41,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Nancy Drew, The Cluebender Society on the DS.

595
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:51,948
[SPEAKER_10]: For those who may have Rock Band on PlayStation 2 or Wii, you'll get your Rock Band Track Pack Volume 1 this week, which has 30 songs you can play.

596
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:54,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see here.

597
00:39:57,633 --> 00:40:13,273
[SPEAKER_10]: and I think that's about it I mean they're trying to keep it I guess a little bit light next week though or the week after next is actually gonna be pretty nice with Final Fantasy 4 so I would imagine though there's gonna be some surprises with the whole E3 thing at least as far as downloadable stuff goes

598
00:40:13,513 --> 00:40:14,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Messiah Might and Magic Elements 360

599
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:40,829

[SPEAKER_09]: Kakun no Daichi.

[SPEAKER_09]: That is a game coming from Aqua Plus and it not only comes out in Japan but all Asia regions on the PlayStation 3.

602
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:10,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii, Boom Blox gets its Japanese release this week.

603
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,211
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a game I have that I still need to play.

604
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:14,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought it and I haven't even played it yet.

605
00:41:15,332 --> 00:41:16,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching.

606
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:16,673
[SPEAKER_09]: See you next time.

607
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:39,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Quest V

608
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:54,804
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I gotta get this.

609
00:41:54,904 --> 00:42:01,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Kitty No Panda Sports Stadium comes out on the DS, as well as Metal Slug 7 comes out this week in Japan.

610
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:09,094
[SPEAKER_09]: And with the Hello Kitty game, some new Hello Kitty pouches in pink and white, so you can carry your game in style.

611
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:13,898
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that doesn't work for you, how about the Sugar Bunnies pouch that comes out in blue and pink?

612
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:17,581
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very girly week in the Nintendo DS world.

613
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:20,363
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, at least you have Metal Gear on PlayStation 3 to counteract that.

614
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:21,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I was mesmerized.

615
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:22,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

616
00:42:22,344 --> 00:42:22,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

617
00:42:42,555 --> 00:43:07,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I have four games that are going to be out in the next week and I'm going to go ahead and name one for next Sunday too just because by the time I say anything on that day it'd be too late so given that it'll be the next day already so for the UK we have three games in the 18th we have well actually two different systems Baroque on PS2 and Wii and Guitar Hero on Tour on DS which is not all that fun

618
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:09,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

619
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:10,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoiler!

620
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:16,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the 20th, CID 925 and Ordinary Life on PSP.

621
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:19,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Small week for Europe, sadly.

622
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:21,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Very small.

623
00:43:21,356 --> 00:43:28,260
[SPEAKER_09]: But also I think our Europe releases, they really only cover the big, big stuff and not a lot of the little stuff like we have over in Japan.

624
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:30,662
[SPEAKER_09]: This list we use has everything on it.

625
00:43:30,722 --> 00:43:33,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily all AAA titles.

626
00:43:34,865 --> 00:43:36,266
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Virtual Console over in the UK?

627
00:43:36,286 --> 00:43:36,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

628
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:38,955
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have some fun for the virtual console.

629
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:45,280
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one, sorry, I love the description that Eurogamer gives it.

630
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to quote.

631
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:53,886
[SPEAKER_04]: The first of these is Ninja Commando, a top-down vertically scrolling shooter that has ninja and commandos and time travel.

632
00:43:54,226 --> 00:43:56,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It also has a rubbish but very funny English translation.

633
00:43:57,444 --> 00:43:58,625
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best description ever.

634
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:00,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I cracked up when I saw it.

635
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:01,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Ninjas, Commandos, what else do you need?

636
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:02,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Time travel.

637
00:44:03,048 --> 00:44:03,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Time travel.

638
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:04,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Now what else do you need?

639
00:44:04,669 --> 00:44:04,989
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

640
00:44:05,129 --> 00:44:07,191
[SPEAKER_04]: A rubbish English translation.

641
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:08,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

642
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:09,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything I want in a game.

643
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:10,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Make your time.

644
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:10,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Zeroing.

645
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:22,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Art of Fighting 2 is another one, which is just a fighting game, but it had tons of jokes for Capcom came from that.

646
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:23,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know the Art of Fighting game?

647
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:28,825
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's the game series that also spawned us our Dan Hibiki.

648
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,266
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a fighter named after me.

649
00:44:30,306 --> 00:44:30,806
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I need.

650
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:32,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

651
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:32,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Robert.

652
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:34,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

653
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:35,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You should cosplay him.

654
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,410
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thank you.

655
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,991
[SPEAKER_04]: With the big ponytail and everything.

656
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:38,412
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you.

657
00:44:38,672 --> 00:44:47,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the Neo Geo games are going to be 900 Wii points translating to 9 euros or 6 pounds 30.

658
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:49,460
[SPEAKER_04]: So, go get them.

659
00:44:51,161 --> 00:44:51,742
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an order.

660
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:53,523
[SPEAKER_04]: After E3, you should probably have some more fun.

661
00:44:54,997 --> 00:45:07,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, now I'm sure this came to a big surprise to everybody this morning, but Microsoft has confirmed that, guess what, the Xbox 360 20GB Pro system has dropped in price to $299.

662
00:45:07,924 --> 00:45:09,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I am so surprised.

663
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:10,705
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a big shocker.

664
00:45:11,325 --> 00:45:22,851
[SPEAKER_10]: And also surprising, and completely not already leaked already, that they will be introducing a new 60GB console that's going to be arriving early August that will be the current $349.

665
00:45:25,052 --> 00:45:26,673
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're not really dropping the price.

666
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:29,736
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just kind of upgrading for the same price.

667
00:45:30,016 --> 00:45:33,518
[SPEAKER_09]: So at the press conference tomorrow, you guys, act surprised.

668
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:36,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Just act surprised.

669
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:38,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

670
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:40,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially when they mention the avatars and stuff.

671
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:42,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretend that you didn't hear it already.

672
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,093
[SPEAKER_09]: or that you didn't hear about some of the Lips rumors leaking out there on the internet.

673
00:45:47,374 --> 00:45:50,917
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we have never heard of this game called Lips that apparently is under development.

674
00:45:51,678 --> 00:46:02,028
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing, Variety Magazine, which is a magazine really for the industry of entertainment, it covers mostly movies, television, music, that stuff, but it does dabble in gaming.

675
00:46:02,808 --> 00:46:05,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And it talked in a recent article about the Lips project.

676
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:08,614
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, hello, if that wasn't confirmation, what do you need?

677
00:46:09,054 --> 00:46:10,474
[SPEAKER_09]: It is going to be at E3.

678
00:46:10,594 --> 00:46:12,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, some of the box art has leaked out.

679
00:46:12,795 --> 00:46:13,275
[SPEAKER_09]: But get this.

680
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:17,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only that, but the wireless microphones have apparently leaked out as well.

681
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,296
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty cool that they're wireless microphones.

682
00:46:19,316 --> 00:46:19,736
[SPEAKER_09]: But get this.

683
00:46:20,056 --> 00:46:20,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this.

684
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:23,797
[SPEAKER_09]: The microphones apparently have lights in them.

685
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:32,179
[SPEAKER_09]: At the base of the microphone have these colored lights that are supposedly... I guess they're like two rings of light that are blue or red.

686
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:35,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently, the way you sing controls the lights.

687
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,600
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess it's one of those things where maybe it's

688
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,782
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

689
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:09,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll bet you anything that little camera works with the game too.

690
00:47:09,362 --> 00:47:09,902
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want to bet?

691
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:15,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I hope it works with something because, you know, I paid good money for that camera.

692
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:17,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, and now we hardly ever get to use it.

693
00:47:18,808 --> 00:47:20,730
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, this game does sound cool already.

694
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:30,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very curious to see what the actual game itself... Because even though we've seen the box art, we've seen the mics, we've seen the concept, we know it's probably most likely being developed by the Elite Beat Agents folks.

695
00:47:30,757 --> 00:47:31,798
[SPEAKER_09]: We have yet to see screens.

696
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:48,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna take a wild guess here and call me a psychic, but I'm gonna guess that they're gonna look something very similar to SingStar, Karaoke Revolution, Rock Band, and probably Guitar Hero World Tour.

697
00:47:48,669 --> 00:47:50,851
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be rad, though, if it was something kinda different.

698
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:51,851
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

699
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:53,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Except it probably won't be.

700
00:47:54,053 --> 00:47:54,813
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably won't.

701
00:47:55,614 --> 00:47:56,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it, Debbie Downer.

702
00:47:58,055 --> 00:47:58,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Raining on my parade.

703
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:01,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Gerardimo says, if you sing badly, do you get a light show?

704
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:04,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com That would be kind of cool.

705
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:05,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Light show.

706
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you deserve a light show if you suck?

707
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:11,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

708
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:13,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's a consolation prize?

709
00:48:13,344 --> 00:48:13,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

710
00:48:14,245 --> 00:48:18,207
[SPEAKER_09]: But Lips, that's one of the titles I can't wait to hear about at the Microsoft press conference.

711
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:20,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you'll have to wait.

712
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:22,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Rob.

713
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:28,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but it's being streamed online like everywhere, and it's supposed to be on TV and all this stuff.

714
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:29,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to watch it during work tomorrow.

715
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:37,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, I have to teach tomorrow, so I can't watch the conference during work, but I will be refreshing some of the gaming blogs on my break to see what's announced.

716
00:48:37,967 --> 00:48:40,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how is this for some happy information?

717
00:48:41,268 --> 00:48:49,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man 9 is actually, they said it was going to be WiiWare coming onto Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

718
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:54,413
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be kind of weird playing a Nintendo-style game on Xbox Live.

719
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:55,374
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's cool.

720
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:56,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

721
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:58,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I don't have to worry about storage issues on my Wii.

722
00:48:58,475 --> 00:48:59,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray.

723
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:01,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Some sort of HD version, though.

724
00:49:02,036 --> 00:49:02,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks for you.

725
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:03,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Or 360.

726
00:49:03,497 --> 00:49:04,217
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be kind of cool.

727
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:06,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Sucks for you, Nintendo, because I was going to buy that game and now I'm not.

728
00:49:07,622 --> 00:49:08,263
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

729
00:49:29,994 --> 00:49:31,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Warcraft joke, but I'm serious.

730
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:35,018
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what she kind of looked like in the trailer, like one of those Poseidon ladies.

731
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,460
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the other robots are kind of cool too.

732
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,723
[SPEAKER_09]: You can only see their silhouettes, but I am all kinds of excited about Mega Man 9.

733
00:49:41,223 --> 00:49:48,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be more excited if they come out at E3 and say it's available now, but I doubt it, seeing as we've already heard rumors of a September release date, but...

734
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:50,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Still, that's not that far off.

735
00:49:51,065 --> 00:49:52,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

736
00:49:52,666 --> 00:50:00,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Something else that's not very far off, too, is a rumored silver DS system, which will be coming out in the U.S.

737
00:50:02,288 --> 00:50:05,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the story actually is coming from GoNintendo.

738
00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:11,911
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a source that says that the... I guess the DS that was with...

739
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:16,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what they're talking about.

740
00:50:16,977 --> 00:50:18,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's totally news to me.

741
00:50:26,286 --> 00:50:35,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would be very surprised if we saw it in September or something, and it was actually the silver and black DS that was with the Guitar Hero bundle.

742
00:50:35,851 --> 00:50:37,252
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be really surprising.

743
00:50:37,272 --> 00:50:37,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't that be neat?

744
00:50:38,032 --> 00:50:38,672
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be neat.

745
00:50:38,892 --> 00:50:39,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Surprising.

746
00:50:39,593 --> 00:50:41,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Completely surprised.

747
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:43,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Just as surprising as Microsoft's press conference will be tomorrow.

748
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:46,516
[SPEAKER_10]: But folks do really need more colors for the DS.

749
00:50:46,556 --> 00:50:47,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

750
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:49,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

751
00:50:49,118 --> 00:50:49,858
[SPEAKER_09]: They're still selling.

752
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:51,179
[SPEAKER_09]: What about Wii colors?

753
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:53,100
[SPEAKER_09]: You think Nintendo's going to give us some Wii colors finally?

754
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:53,460
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

755
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,660
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

756
00:51:12,165 --> 00:51:13,245
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

757
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:35,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the thing, because the game costs supposedly 1,337 Microsoft points, which I'm sure is a joke.

758
00:51:35,532 --> 00:51:36,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, same for the trial, though, too.

759
00:51:37,033 --> 00:51:39,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually going to charge that, yeah, and it shows that the trial.

760
00:51:39,353 --> 00:51:42,794
[SPEAKER_09]: But it also kind of makes you go, hmm, could it be a Photoshop or something?

761
00:51:42,814 --> 00:51:43,694
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be a Photoshop.

762
00:51:43,714 --> 00:51:44,014
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be.

763
00:51:44,174 --> 00:51:54,356
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's interesting about it is that apparently some achievements have also leaked for the game, including one called Looks Like a Cleanup on Aisle 4 is the achievement.

764
00:51:55,056 --> 00:51:57,977
[SPEAKER_09]: And to get that, you have to step in a pile of poop.

765
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:02,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I was joking, but that is really the achievement.

766
00:52:02,142 --> 00:52:06,103
[SPEAKER_09]: And the picture of the achievement looks like a pile of poop.

767
00:52:07,183 --> 00:52:09,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Which makes me think this is even more of a fake, but you never know.

768
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:11,364
[SPEAKER_09]: They had poop in the game.

769
00:52:11,724 --> 00:52:16,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, but if these screenshots are fake, it's a damn good fake.

770
00:52:16,686 --> 00:52:17,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give them that.

771
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:21,985
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll find out, I'm sure, tomorrow.

772
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you think that this might be one of their games?

773
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:26,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, they did this with Doom, didn't they?

774
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:27,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't they come out at some European conference?

775
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:31,096
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't have five Xbox Live Arcade games coming out tomorrow.

776
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:31,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure we could.

777
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:32,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Or next week.

778
00:52:32,558 --> 00:52:33,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure we could.

779
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:34,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like that, but we can't.

780
00:52:34,781 --> 00:52:35,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all would.

781
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:37,469
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

782
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:08,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoever faked it, I hope you burn in hell for getting my hopes up.

783
00:53:09,341 --> 00:53:12,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you step in many piles of poop for the rest of your life.

784
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:15,444
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a wonderful Middle Eastern curse that applies.

785
00:53:15,684 --> 00:53:16,064
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

786
00:53:16,264 --> 00:53:18,585
[SPEAKER_04]: May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals.

787
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:19,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and poop.

788
00:53:21,146 --> 00:53:21,967
[SPEAKER_09]: In your genitals.

789
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:24,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha, poop in your genitals.

790
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:29,070
[SPEAKER_09]: This show is rated T for trashy, for all the toilet humor.

791
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:30,831
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rated P for poo-poo.

792
00:53:31,131 --> 00:53:31,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

793
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:34,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of poo-poo... Hey!

794
00:53:38,198 --> 00:53:40,540
[SPEAKER_09]: The King of Poopy Headedness He Who Shall Not Be Named

795
00:54:00,498 --> 00:54:05,319
[SPEAKER_10]: is Jack Thompson, and it will actually, it will change it to Lord Voldemort for you.

796
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:06,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Well done, Loki, well done.

797
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so yes, what is the latest in Jack, I mean, Lord Voldemort world?

798
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:27,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the judge who is, I think, is in charge of the trial, Davatunis, I guess is the name, has referred to he who shall not be named as mentally impaired and

799
00:54:29,273 --> 00:54:30,614
[SPEAKER_04]: A raving wild woman.

800
00:54:31,915 --> 00:54:33,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, a raving wild woman?

801
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,198
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Thompson referred to her as that.

802
00:54:36,238 --> 00:54:36,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

803
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:37,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I gotcha.

804
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:40,201
[SPEAKER_04]: He referred to her as mentally impaired and a raving wild woman.

805
00:54:40,281 --> 00:54:41,102
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

806
00:54:41,162 --> 00:54:44,184
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish a judge would refer to him as a raving wild woman.

807
00:54:44,605 --> 00:54:45,565
[SPEAKER_09]: You crazy bitch.

808
00:54:45,705 --> 00:54:46,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Sit down.

809
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:55,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the judge has recommended that dude be assessed a $43,675 fine for legal costs incurred by the Florida Bar Association.

810
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:08,281
[SPEAKER_04]: and he has been found guilty of 27 of 31 charges in a misconduct suit and the judge wants him disbarred.

811
00:55:08,741 --> 00:55:10,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that they have it figured out down to the dollar.

812
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:12,444
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what would make that even better?

813
00:55:12,804 --> 00:55:14,345
[SPEAKER_09]: If it was figured out down to the cent.

814
00:55:14,805 --> 00:55:16,746
[SPEAKER_10]: It is figured out down to the cents, actually.

815
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:18,287
[SPEAKER_10]: On Kotaku, they had the cents.

816
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:19,528
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like $36.35 or something.

817
00:55:19,548 --> 00:55:20,108
[SPEAKER_10]: It was $0.35, I remember that.

818
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:27,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Hugs and kisses to the folks who made that happen then.

819
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:29,102
[SPEAKER_04]: He should be forced to pay it on sight.

820
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:30,725
[SPEAKER_09]: To me.

821
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:33,731
[SPEAKER_04]: No, to the Florida bar.

822
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:34,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fine.

823
00:55:35,154 --> 00:55:35,635
[SPEAKER_09]: But then to me.

824
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:37,038
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a fucker.

825
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:40,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

826
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:54,581
[SPEAKER_09]: As much as this is actually kind of good news in a way that maybe he'll finally be forced to go away, although I'm sure he'll troll all the blogs still, just hearing that name, Lord Voldemort, inspires fear and anger in me.

827
00:55:55,862 --> 00:55:59,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be getting to the FUs of the week soon, but there's more, apparently.

828
00:55:59,765 --> 00:56:04,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to read the actual first line on this one, because I actually did check on GamePolitics.

829
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:05,550
[SPEAKER_04]: It says,

830
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:27,825
[SPEAKER_04]: The case involves factual findings of cumulative misconduct, a repeated pattern of behavior relentlessly forced upon numerous unconnected individuals, a total lack of remorse or even slight acknowledgement of inappropriate conduct.

831
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:30,387
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

832
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,071
[SPEAKER_04]: The bottom two things that I'll read.

833
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and skip to the last paragraph.

834
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:37,574
[SPEAKER_04]: This middle name's Bruce.

835
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:53,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Fleas in your pants.

836
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:53,932
[SPEAKER_04]: More.

837
00:56:53,972 --> 00:56:54,532
[SPEAKER_09]: In your genitals.

838
00:56:54,853 --> 00:56:58,497
[SPEAKER_04]: A, permanent disbarment with no leave to reapply for admission.

839
00:56:59,258 --> 00:57:01,481
[SPEAKER_04]: B, disciplinary costs currently totaling $43,675.35.

840
00:57:01,842 --> 00:57:02,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

841
00:57:02,082 --> 00:57:02,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently totaling.

842
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:03,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we bring on the Yanks now?

843
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently news about Lord Voldemort makes you gassy.

844
00:57:30,603 --> 00:57:33,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I was opening my mouth to say something and it said I had a juice burp.

845
00:57:33,565 --> 00:57:34,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

846
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:37,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Multi-part F you.

847
00:57:37,308 --> 00:57:40,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, to the heat returning.

848
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:49,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And number two, to people who think...

849
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:58,171
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the right to tell someone else what to say or do or think just because they themselves are offended.

850
00:57:59,071 --> 00:57:59,592
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

851
00:58:00,693 --> 00:58:03,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't people learn how to fucking roll with the punches?

852
00:58:03,094 --> 00:58:04,195
[SPEAKER_09]: This has to be a co-worker.

853
00:58:04,555 --> 00:58:04,695
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

854
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:05,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

855
00:58:05,676 --> 00:58:06,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in general.

856
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:07,918
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not a co-worker.

857
00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:08,858
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just in general.

858
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:16,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I've sort of hit a point of saturation where I'm so sick with all these people who are like, I don't like what you did, Sue.

859
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:43,437
[SPEAKER_04]: or you you said a mean thing about me and sue and you know just people who don't know how to get the fuck over themselves and get on with it you know what since somebody says something shitty about you fuck them why should it matter and also on the same lines um f you to anyone and I'm gonna say it fuck you to anyone who tries to tell me how I should talk

860
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:45,671
[SPEAKER_04]: This is America.

861
00:58:46,371 --> 00:59:01,002
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing in the Constitution that limits my ability to say fuck, shit, damn, cock, or any other so-called curse word that I wish to say in any type of form unless it is specifically said as part of a private organization that these words are not allowed.

862
00:59:01,322 --> 00:59:03,323
[SPEAKER_04]: As in, like, part of my employment say.

863
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,204
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

864
00:59:04,544 --> 00:59:07,466
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can stand outside of my place of employment and go, fuck!

865
00:59:08,187 --> 00:59:08,827
[SPEAKER_04]: All I want to.

866
00:59:09,347 --> 00:59:09,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's illegal.

867
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:17,671
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, DarkSakura, the lawyers will be calling about the lawsuit with the FLEs in my genitals.

868
00:59:18,091 --> 00:59:20,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I also plan on cursing in front of my children.

869
00:59:22,915 --> 00:59:23,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you why.

870
00:59:23,696 --> 00:59:25,958
[SPEAKER_09]: The Osborne kids came down only slightly fucked up.

871
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:28,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a discussion about this with my friend who's a parent as well.

872
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:34,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said she's not going to have any problem with, you know, say a kid falls and goes, oh damn, or shit, that hurts.

873
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:41,449
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not going to have a problem with it, but have a problem if someone uses it specifically in a derogatory or attacking way.

874
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:41,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

875
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, teach someone to be nice.

876
00:59:44,172 --> 00:59:46,633
[SPEAKER_04]: You can learn when it's appropriate and when it's not appropriate.

877
00:59:47,054 --> 00:59:54,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not going to discourage my children, if I ever have any, to have to curtail their own freedom of speech for somebody else's comfort.

878
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:57,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have kids yet.

879
00:59:57,782 --> 00:59:58,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe someday.

880
00:59:58,563 --> 01:00:00,725
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm still kind of thinking kind of a similar thing.

881
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:04,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you don't make it such a bad thing, then kids won't want to do it.

882
01:00:04,107 --> 01:00:05,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be a big deal.

883
01:00:05,088 --> 01:00:05,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

884
01:00:05,889 --> 01:00:08,231
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, half the reason why I think that a lot of...

885
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty in chat says, See, that's another reason I don't have an intention of having demon spawn.

886
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:40,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually thinking in the next two years.

887
01:00:41,425 --> 01:00:41,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my heck.

888
01:00:43,187 --> 01:00:43,848
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be something.

889
01:00:43,888 --> 01:00:45,129
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Loki, your FU is the week.

890
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:48,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to probably still be here every Sunday.

891
01:00:49,674 --> 01:00:50,294
[SPEAKER_09]: With the baby?

892
01:00:51,175 --> 01:00:51,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

893
01:00:52,296 --> 01:00:53,357
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm going to make Dan babysit.

894
01:00:53,598 --> 01:00:53,858
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

895
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, Loki, FU the PSP web browser for sucking.

896
01:00:59,314 --> 01:01:00,015
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I got.

897
01:01:00,415 --> 01:01:01,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, mine's short too.

898
01:01:01,316 --> 01:01:02,257
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to smoke.

899
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:06,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't mean the fighter in Mortal Kombat 3 or 4 or whatever, even though he kind of sucked too.

900
01:01:07,502 --> 01:01:11,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about the smoke that's out there in the air, like a fucking volcano blew up in my backyard.

901
01:01:12,386 --> 01:01:13,067
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty horrible.

902
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:18,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And thankfully I don't still live up in Chico where all the fires are happening, because I hear up in Chico it's raining ash.

903
01:01:19,152 --> 01:01:22,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine if you walked outside one day and it's raining ash?

904
01:01:22,895 --> 01:01:23,596
[SPEAKER_09]: That sucks.

905
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:25,938
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like you are actually living in hell.

906
01:01:27,842 --> 01:01:28,763
[SPEAKER_09]: or Dante's Peak.

907
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:33,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Without... Or Pompeii the day before.

908
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:36,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, without frickin' what's-her-name-for-the-Terminator being there.

909
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:39,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

910
01:01:39,692 --> 01:01:39,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

911
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:44,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's more rumors.

912
01:01:44,616 --> 01:01:45,637
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to say this.

913
01:01:45,677 --> 01:01:46,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

914
01:01:46,478 --> 01:01:49,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Gulp Banjo in chat says, Jamie, have the baby live on air.

915
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:51,843
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be an educational thing.

916
01:01:52,223 --> 01:01:53,024
[SPEAKER_09]: The miracle of life.

917
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:53,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

918
01:01:56,697 --> 01:02:05,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already discussed it, but I plan on when I do squirt out my own demon spawn, I'm going to have a midwife and do it at home.

919
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,362
[SPEAKER_08]: When the parasite crawls out?

920
01:02:08,763 --> 01:02:14,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's funny, my friend, and Becky is so awesome, we kept referring to her baby as her symbiote.

921
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,401
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

922
01:02:37,896 --> 01:02:43,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, these controllers, you may be able to use it to shove organs of your enemies up into their ribcage.

923
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:45,843
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I don't know.

924
01:02:46,343 --> 01:02:52,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, there's a rumor, there's still rumors going around that Microsoft's going to reveal some sort of motion controllers.

925
01:02:52,968 --> 01:02:56,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And if that's true, then they're thinking that maybe that these...

926
01:02:56,891 --> 01:03:01,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Modus Games' Darwin controllers are actually the 360 motion controllers.

927
01:03:01,955 --> 01:03:03,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a few reasons why they may think that.

928
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:06,199
[SPEAKER_10]: One, the controllers kind of fit the color scheme.

929
01:03:06,859 --> 01:03:13,204
[SPEAKER_10]: They are white plastic and they've got four lights on them indicating that you use four at one time.

930
01:03:13,825 --> 01:03:20,110
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of makes them a little bit different than, say, the Wii Remote and stuff like that, they're kind of...

931
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:23,252
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

932
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:42,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Showing them being used in Tiger Woods, Lego, Star Wars, stuff like that.

933
01:03:43,293 --> 01:03:46,854
[SPEAKER_10]: So they look pretty cool, and they work pretty much just like the Wii Remote and Nunchuck.

934
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:52,417
[SPEAKER_10]: But they are wireless, which is nice, so you don't have stupid cord tethering you together.

935
01:03:53,837 --> 01:03:54,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

936
01:03:54,438 --> 01:03:58,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we'll find out tomorrow, or today, depending on when you listen to the podcast.

937
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

938
01:03:59,319 --> 01:03:59,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay tuned.

939
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure we'll be talking a lot, a lot about the E3 announcements next week.

940
01:04:03,801 --> 01:04:05,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think Microsoft getting into motion control is a good thing?

941
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

942
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:08,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

943
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,071
[SPEAKER_10]: It would depend on how they did it.

944
01:04:10,911 --> 01:04:12,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully it would be optional stuff.

945
01:04:14,173 --> 01:04:16,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that they would try to release a Wii Sports style game?

946
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:17,695
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like their passion game.

947
01:04:17,715 --> 01:04:19,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do you think that would be completely obvious?

948
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:21,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be kind of stupid.

949
01:04:21,437 --> 01:04:27,340
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could see if they did put out Motion Controller that you would get a lot more of those crappy games on the 360.

950
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:30,991
[SPEAKER_10]: XBOX Live Arcade

951
01:04:41,888 --> 01:04:49,893
[SPEAKER_10]: But their whole thing right now is they're trying to get a piece of that casual market that Nintendo seems to have kind of a hold of.

952
01:04:50,373 --> 01:04:55,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what's more interesting is what's Sony going to do?

953
01:04:56,877 --> 01:04:58,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they want to get into the casual market as well.

954
01:04:58,838 --> 01:05:00,899
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't heard too much about what they're going to do.

955
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:04,761
[SPEAKER_10]: And there were rumors a long time ago about new controllers and stuff like that.

956
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:06,582
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe they're going to do something too.

957
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:08,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

958
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:08,864
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

959
01:05:09,431 --> 01:05:10,532
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

960
01:05:33,093 --> 01:05:58,046
[SPEAKER_09]: and um so what happened the game was completely reworked now rated m all the oh was it it was rated m and now they got a rate at t so all the the references to booze were taken out of the game and now the game is pong toss pong toss instead of beer pong you get pong toss but you know whatever i think either way the game's gonna gotta be hokey i mean if you're gonna play beer pong if i could play beer pong

961
01:05:58,985 --> 01:05:59,445
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

962
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:26,087
[SPEAKER_09]: How much is that?

963
01:06:26,127 --> 01:06:27,348
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's supposed to be on the marketplace?

964
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:27,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know?

965
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:29,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably like five or ten bucks.

966
01:06:29,469 --> 01:06:32,712
[SPEAKER_10]: It better be five because ten is way too much for that.

967
01:06:33,313 --> 01:06:36,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, now we're going to get to the mailbag part of the program.

968
01:06:36,295 --> 01:06:43,422
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the part where you can send in your emails every week to mailbag at orangelawntrader.com and we read them live on air for our amusement and to poke fun at you.

969
01:06:43,602 --> 01:06:44,102
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just kidding.

970
01:06:44,122 --> 01:06:45,664
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you ask a good question, we'll answer it.

971
01:06:45,704 --> 01:06:47,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's open up the old mailbag, DarkSakura.

972
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,467
[SPEAKER_09]: See what the listeners have to say.

973
01:06:52,628 --> 01:06:56,072
[SPEAKER_04]: We have letters, but only three, four.

974
01:06:56,572 --> 01:06:59,015
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, it's a short show, short mailbag.

975
01:06:59,155 --> 01:07:00,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got a letter from Rob with two Bs.

976
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:03,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, Rob with two Bs.

977
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,804
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, this is mostly for Sky and Loki because DS dropped me already.

978
01:07:09,986 --> 01:07:10,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not drop you.

979
01:07:10,907 --> 01:07:12,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you right now, I did not drop you.

980
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:14,551
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Dan's friends list.

981
01:07:15,712 --> 01:07:21,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I was using Dan's friends list with him for a while, and he has removed people that he does not know.

982
01:07:21,578 --> 01:07:23,460
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was not me, it was my husband.

983
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this an Xbox Live thing?

984
01:07:24,622 --> 01:07:24,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

985
01:07:25,162 --> 01:07:26,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

986
01:07:26,864 --> 01:07:27,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not drop you.

987
01:07:28,646 --> 01:07:29,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not drop you.

988
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:33,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it makes it sound like we dropped him like a $2 hooker, and that's not the case.

989
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:34,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Drop him.

990
01:07:36,792 --> 01:07:40,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that I want to be dropped, but rather that I don't play many online games.

991
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:43,440
[SPEAKER_04]: The only decent but humbling online play was with Rob and friends on Halo 2.

992
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I play online, I get overwhelmed by radical and social epithets, so there's little incentive to go online.

993
01:07:50,245 --> 01:07:55,849
[SPEAKER_04]: If I ever become a big online game player in a particular game that one of you has, I may re-request later.

994
01:07:55,869 --> 01:07:59,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, my second Xbox 360 died, so I haven't played anything on it for a while.

995
01:08:00,753 --> 01:08:03,375
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I do have my own gamer tag.

996
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't use it, but as soon as I remember what it is, I'll let you know.

997
01:08:07,218 --> 01:08:07,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And I won't delete you.

998
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:16,885
[SPEAKER_04]: On an unrelated note, did you try to switch your controller assignment from 1 to 2 when fighting Screaming Mantis on Metal Gear Solid 4?

999
01:08:16,985 --> 01:08:17,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Hilarity ensues.

1000
01:08:18,826 --> 01:08:37,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally didn't enjoy the swap to disk 2 joke because the loading to hard drive screens are more painful than swapping disks what a dang good point see you online Rob what a good point Rob brings up is that you know don't joke about the disk swapping thing and the whole this is blu-ray when the game has a freaking install good point

1001
01:08:39,013 --> 01:08:40,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican Actdeft

1002
01:09:01,394 --> 01:09:03,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I have lots of friendly neighborhood Mexicans, actually.

1003
01:09:04,775 --> 01:09:12,379
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, congrats to your 6th anniversary, which I unfortunately missed, and a belated congrats to Rob for his birthday, which I'm getting Rob a present soon.

1004
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:12,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1005
01:09:13,419 --> 01:09:13,999
[SPEAKER_04]: A late present.

1006
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, I don't worry about it.

1007
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:17,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine.

1008
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:17,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry about it.

1009
01:09:17,801 --> 01:09:18,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I am!

1010
01:09:19,762 --> 01:09:26,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, thanks to Rob for remembering me when he interviewed Tommy Tallarico and asking him if Video Games Live will return to Mexicali.

1011
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:32,033
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a pretty good interview, by the way, and it's good to hear he cares for the fans, too.

1012
01:09:32,755 --> 01:09:33,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And, well, I think that's all.

1013
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:34,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, and ja.

1014
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:44,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was a long interview, but he's definitely passionate and he's definitely doing a lot for the video game industry.

1015
01:09:44,175 --> 01:09:45,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I was kind of surprised.

1016
01:09:45,295 --> 01:09:54,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of thought he was a little more on the hands-off journalist reporting end, but he does a lot more hands-on than you might know at first.

1017
01:09:55,823 --> 01:10:01,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if you're basing your opinion of him strictly off of the Judgment Day show.

1018
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:02,747
[SPEAKER_09]: You're really missing out.

1019
01:10:02,867 --> 01:10:03,648
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one thing I learned.

1020
01:10:04,252 --> 01:10:07,553
[SPEAKER_04]: This email was sponsored in part by Konami, home of Never Ending Lawsuits.

1021
01:10:08,933 --> 01:10:10,313
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Deftis Cabrown.

1022
01:10:10,493 --> 01:10:11,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I see what she did there.

1023
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:12,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1024
01:10:13,574 --> 01:10:14,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Email!

1025
01:10:14,254 --> 01:10:15,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Dun dun dun.

1026
01:10:15,534 --> 01:10:16,454
[SPEAKER_04]: From Jonathan.

1027
01:10:17,554 --> 01:10:23,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear OLR, I have been a long time listener and have been tuning into your show for a little over two years now.

1028
01:10:23,295 --> 01:10:23,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1029
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:30,396
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my first time writing to you guys and oddly enough I am typing this from the Wii internet browser since my computer practically died on me.

1030
01:10:30,596 --> 01:10:31,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1031
01:10:31,617 --> 01:10:32,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Emailing from Wii?

1032
01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:33,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Impressive.

1033
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:41,328
[SPEAKER_04]: My game systems have come in handy during these months and I think it is a blessing that they allow us to do more than just game.

1034
01:10:41,788 --> 01:10:45,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I too, as well as many of your other listeners, use my PSP to get my weekly fix.

1035
01:10:46,112 --> 01:10:50,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that you guys should do just one big show.

1036
01:10:50,536 --> 01:10:57,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it could be great having it all at once, but at the same time, as Rob points out, we could have spread it out during the week.

1037
01:10:59,382 --> 01:11:05,025
[SPEAKER_04]: As of late, I have found the delays of Part B to be annoying, but I understand that things happen.

1038
01:11:05,085 --> 01:11:09,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not fussing at Rob, but try to get it in on Thursday or Friday instead of Saturday or Saturday.

1039
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:09,766
[SPEAKER_04]: LOL.

1040
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:10,867
[SPEAKER_04]: We've addressed that.

1041
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:19,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and hopefully, you know, I know he says he likes having it in two parts, but I think the whole split thing, Ultra Army and the whole combined thing, we'll try it out.

1042
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:21,031
[SPEAKER_09]: If the listeners don't like it, we'll change it back.

1043
01:11:22,165 --> 01:11:29,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, I guess this should count for my FU of the week, but regarding the limited friends list on Xbox Live, I think that this is total bull.

1044
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:36,055
[SPEAKER_04]: People can't be limited to how many friends they can have to game with, and I think that should be part of the next dashboard update.

1045
01:11:36,775 --> 01:11:38,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I should... No, I know all of your pro...

1046
01:11:40,617 --> 01:11:42,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I know all about your problem, Rob.

1047
01:11:42,638 --> 01:11:47,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I am on Loki's friends list, though, if you need to contact me.

1048
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:52,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, for any OLR listeners who would like to add me, my gamer tag is UnfoldedRaptor.

1049
01:11:52,922 --> 01:11:55,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, I'm sorry if my email is a bit long for such a great show.

1050
01:11:55,783 --> 01:11:57,044
[SPEAKER_04]: There is so much to be said.

1051
01:11:57,244 --> 01:11:58,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

1052
01:11:59,165 --> 01:12:01,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the great work and don't stop believing, from Jonathan.

1053
01:12:01,846 --> 01:12:04,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Florida, home of the never-ending supply of dying elderly.

1054
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:08,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1055
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:10,880
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little bit horrible, but nice.

1056
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,001
[SPEAKER_04]: The last email is for me.

1057
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:13,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw.

1058
01:12:14,202 --> 01:12:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Jamie, I know I'm a dear.

1059
01:12:17,523 --> 01:12:22,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for choosing Ristar, one of my favorite classic games of all time, as the classic game of the week.

1060
01:12:23,526 --> 01:12:28,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel bad for not being present that evening, but I'm really sorry if I made you angry.

1061
01:12:28,688 --> 01:12:33,770
[SPEAKER_04]: But being able to listen to it on the podcast was good enough for me and made my day, to say the least.

1062
01:12:37,973 --> 01:12:59,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a pity that the audio wasn't working, so to make up for it and my absence, I will send a few separate emails with attached zip files that contain all of the great songs from Raystar, including my favorite Shooting Raystar and Ring Rink, which are songs that play in Act 1 of Planet Florida and Act 1 of Planet Freon.

1063
01:12:59,651 --> 01:13:00,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, Oscar.

1064
01:13:00,772 --> 01:13:01,152
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

1065
01:13:01,272 --> 01:13:01,933
[SPEAKER_04]: You win the world.

1066
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:16,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sadly, I'm a little lazy to open up your files and open up the massive MP3s, but the good news is that YouTube appears to be working tonight, so here's a little bit of what you missed out on last week, if I can get a little clip here of the actual gameplay.

1067
01:13:16,744 --> 01:13:27,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to hear more about this game, go listen to last week's show.

1068
01:13:29,635 --> 01:13:30,236
[SPEAKER_09]: That it for email?

1069
01:13:31,056 --> 01:13:31,757
[SPEAKER_04]: That be all.

1070
01:13:32,268 --> 01:13:32,668
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1071
01:13:32,748 --> 01:13:36,769
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1072
01:13:36,989 --> 01:13:37,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, back to the game news.

1073
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:39,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1074
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:43,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know what I should really say about this.

1075
01:13:44,531 --> 01:13:45,691
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weird.

1076
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,412
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1077
01:13:48,492 --> 01:13:58,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyways, Nintendo has unveiled a brand new, I guess, I don't know if it's a franchise, but game called Captain Rainbow.

1078
01:13:59,755 --> 01:14:00,195
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's...

1079
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:04,554
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1080
01:14:21,101 --> 01:14:26,462
[SPEAKER_10]: What they've said so far is that it's filled with, like, B characters from different games.

1081
01:14:26,822 --> 01:14:34,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, in the trailer that they had on WiiFolder.com, you see Birdo in there, like, talking in Japanese and stuff.

1082
01:14:35,344 --> 01:14:36,724
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a bunch of weird characters.

1083
01:14:37,624 --> 01:14:38,485
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh... So, wait, wait.

1084
01:14:38,585 --> 01:14:41,525
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a brand new IP that borrows from all the other IPs.

1085
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:42,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Sort of, yeah.

1086
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Just characters they hope you don't remember.

1087
01:14:44,386 --> 01:14:49,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and the main character is this, like, dude who turns into Captain Rainbow.

1088
01:14:49,627 --> 01:14:49,767
[SPEAKER_10]: This...

1089
01:14:50,816 --> 01:14:56,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Captain Rainbow Reading Rainbow Wasn't that just Mario?

1090
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:23,340
[SPEAKER_09]: no interesting

1091
01:15:25,497 --> 01:15:27,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, more franchises.

1092
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:28,459
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a good thing, though.

1093
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:30,920
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not just borrowing from all the other old games.

1094
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom is starting a new one as well.

1095
01:15:32,921 --> 01:15:34,762
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an Xbox Live arcade game that's coming out.

1096
01:15:34,802 --> 01:15:35,742
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Flock.

1097
01:15:36,502 --> 01:15:54,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Flock is a flocking puzzle game that is, apparently, it's got to do with, like, you're in this grid-style thing, but you're a UFO, and you herd these animals, and apparently the animals have effects, and then they are, therefore, affected by certain parts and levels and the puzzle aspects.

1098
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:57,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently this game is supposed to be kind of like Lemmings.

1099
01:15:58,072 --> 01:16:02,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Over 50 different stages, co-op online play, and a way to edit your own levels in the game.

1100
01:16:02,453 --> 01:16:02,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Should be pretty neat.

1101
01:16:02,913 --> 01:16:06,234
[SPEAKER_10]: This was supposed to be their secret project that they were unveiling at E3.

1102
01:16:06,634 --> 01:16:08,515
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't look that cool, to be honest.

1103
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:09,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

1104
01:16:09,775 --> 01:16:10,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a little clip.

1105
01:16:10,515 --> 01:16:14,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a video doesn't work that great over the radio, but at least you can hear a little of the music.

1106
01:16:16,977 --> 01:16:17,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, it looks cute.

1107
01:16:17,837 --> 01:16:18,997
[SPEAKER_09]: They're little sheep.

1108
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:20,618
[SPEAKER_09]: They're herding everywhere with the UFO.

1109
01:16:20,638 --> 01:16:20,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1110
01:16:22,335 --> 01:16:25,037
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a cross between Kirby Golf and Lemmings.

1111
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll still play the trial if nothing else.

1112
01:16:31,762 --> 01:16:32,342
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be cool.

1113
01:16:32,502 --> 01:16:32,942
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

1114
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:36,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember folks, Dead Rising Wii.

1115
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:39,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they keep saying that's not going to happen.

1116
01:16:40,348 --> 01:16:40,968
[SPEAKER_09]: But we know better.

1117
01:16:41,208 --> 01:16:43,530
[SPEAKER_09]: What a flocking interesting announcement.

1118
01:16:45,171 --> 01:16:49,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so yeah, Flock coming soon to Xbox Live Arcade.

1119
01:16:49,914 --> 01:16:51,876
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds fascinating.

1120
01:16:52,264 --> 01:16:52,304
[SPEAKER_09]: E.A.

1121
01:16:52,344 --> 01:16:54,225
[SPEAKER_09]: was planning on releasing two new drum kits for Rock Band 2.

1122
01:17:11,978 --> 01:17:40,010
[SPEAKER_04]: a velocity sensitive drum pad and it won't be as noisy and it will have reinforced metal pedals and clip-on cymbals and the second one is actually licensed by Ion and it's called the Ion Drum Kit it's a fairly expensive one but there are electromagnetic cymbals and adjustable pads and metal frame and this would be really sweet and expensive

1123
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:41,781
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, you heard her right.

1124
01:17:42,202 --> 01:17:46,267
[SPEAKER_10]: There are going to be add-on symbols for the rock band drums.

1125
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:48,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, interesting.

1126
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:55,957
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if people will pay like 300, 400 bucks for those arcade-style Beatmania 2DX and pop music controllers, though, why not?

1127
01:17:56,137 --> 01:17:59,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not pay a lot of money for these ION super-duper drum sets?

1128
01:18:00,121 --> 01:18:02,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I don't know where the F in my house I would put them.

1129
01:18:03,405 --> 01:18:03,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I want them.

1130
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:04,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Except out here in the garage.

1131
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:05,327
[SPEAKER_09]: For real?

1132
01:18:06,068 --> 01:18:06,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I want them.

1133
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought the wife hated the drums.

1134
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:08,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're at work.

1135
01:18:10,012 --> 01:18:10,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, I see.

1136
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:12,673
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1137
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:36,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Why feed children?

1138
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless they're going to build me a kickass drum set.

1139
01:18:38,995 --> 01:18:41,259
[SPEAKER_09]: You could be playing Billy Idol in Rock Band 2.

1140
01:18:42,554 --> 01:18:45,736
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a nice day for a white wedding.

1141
01:18:46,176 --> 01:18:46,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1142
01:18:47,457 --> 01:18:49,018
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a nice day for some more gaming news, too.

1143
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:49,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1144
01:18:50,599 --> 01:18:51,079
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1145
01:18:51,840 --> 01:19:01,866
[SPEAKER_10]: How many times have we heard this rumor that there's going to be an announcement during the Nintendo conference that's going to unveil Animal Crossing Wii?

1146
01:19:03,067 --> 01:19:03,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1147
01:19:03,847 --> 01:19:06,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, are we really going to be shocked if it gets announced?

1148
01:19:08,012 --> 01:19:10,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because it's like, OMG, it's finally here.

1149
01:19:11,135 --> 01:19:17,660
[SPEAKER_09]: The more the shock is, is it going to look like it's going to actually be kind of different and more interesting than the DS one?

1150
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:25,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm guessing they're not innovating on shit, since they didn't innovate on hardly anything from the DS and GameCube ones.

1151
01:19:26,121 --> 01:19:30,344
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll still buy it because I'm a consumer whore Mr. Dream

1152
01:19:49,571 --> 01:19:50,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Tyson, maybe?

1153
01:19:51,192 --> 01:19:51,912
[SPEAKER_09]: George Foreman?

1154
01:19:51,993 --> 01:19:52,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Put him in the game.

1155
01:19:52,573 --> 01:19:52,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

1156
01:19:53,173 --> 01:19:54,494
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a fucking Excite Truck 2.

1157
01:19:54,954 --> 01:19:56,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck this Punch-Out shit.

1158
01:19:57,596 --> 01:19:58,116
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1159
01:19:58,937 --> 01:20:05,321
[SPEAKER_09]: The news conference is only days away, and that will confirm Animal Crossing and Punch-Out, possibly, or possibly not.

1160
01:20:05,461 --> 01:20:07,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's what I'm worried about, okay?

1161
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:12,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Nintendo, they have a trend of following stupid ideas sometimes.

1162
01:20:12,465 --> 01:20:15,147
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, with the whole Wii wheel and the Wii zapper.

1163
01:20:15,707 --> 01:20:16,528
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just like...

1164
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:18,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, the Wii Wheel!

1165
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:25,111
[SPEAKER_10]: People buy those stupid third-party wheels because they want to pretend that they have a steering wheel because they can't use their imagination.

1166
01:20:25,551 --> 01:20:26,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's put one out, too!

1167
01:20:27,212 --> 01:20:29,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you know, they can't imagine that it's a gun.

1168
01:20:29,614 --> 01:20:30,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's make it look like a gun.

1169
01:20:30,735 --> 01:20:34,157
[SPEAKER_10]: What are we going to have with the fucking, you know, boxing gloves or something?

1170
01:20:34,618 --> 01:20:38,781
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, there's going to be some really retarded stuff coming out, I'm sure.

1171
01:20:39,642 --> 01:20:39,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1172
01:20:39,962 --> 01:20:41,083
[SPEAKER_10]: There'll be storage, dammit!

1173
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:42,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I want my storage!

1174
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:44,988
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what this show needs, you guys?

1175
01:20:45,469 --> 01:20:48,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we wrap it up and take some calls and get out of here for the night.

1176
01:20:48,595 --> 01:20:49,436
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what this show needs?

1177
01:20:49,857 --> 01:20:50,679
[SPEAKER_09]: More Journey.

1178
01:20:54,966 --> 01:20:57,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome down the boulevard

1179
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:24,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Run, Do Not Walk, To Mame, and check this out.

1180
01:21:25,014 --> 01:21:28,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's a cheesy game, but for its time period, it was awesome.

1181
01:21:28,655 --> 01:21:33,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the actual cabinet would play the song separate ways on tape.

1182
01:21:33,796 --> 01:21:37,738
[SPEAKER_09]: When you beat the game, you were at a Journey concert, and separate ways would play on tape, and it was awesome.

1183
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:39,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the aliens would kidnap all their instruments again.

1184
01:21:40,798 --> 01:21:41,939
[SPEAKER_09]: However, Steve Perry...

1185
01:21:45,302 --> 01:21:47,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I never thought we should have done the game Rock Snob

1186
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:29,061
[SPEAKER_09]: and then you get this as if the ego wasn't big enough see it's funny because I thought that we were big already that we didn't need a video game but that's just how the world judges you like gee whiz you have a Lamborghini so you must be big I didn't understand that whatever like seriously go watch some of your own 80s music videos and yeah then come back to me come back to me and talk I still love Journey though and I still love Steve Perry even if he's a rock snob who kind of said a dumpy thing this week

1187
01:22:30,848 --> 01:22:31,789
[SPEAKER_09]: and JourneyStillAwesome.

1188
01:22:31,829 --> 01:22:33,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't let anybody tell you different.

1189
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:33,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, DarkSakura?

1190
01:22:34,871 --> 01:22:35,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Right!

1191
01:22:35,512 --> 01:22:35,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1192
01:22:38,014 --> 01:22:40,416
[SPEAKER_09]: And... And the ferret.

1193
01:22:40,896 --> 01:22:41,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1194
01:22:42,017 --> 01:22:48,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we close out the show tonight, get to the sky plane, get some calls, we have to pay respect to our elders this week by revisiting the classics.

1195
01:22:49,363 --> 01:22:57,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have for you guys, if Jamie doesn't drop her microphone much more, we have for you a trip down memory lane with this, the classic game of the week.

1196
01:22:59,070 --> 01:22:59,671
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently...

1197
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:04,283
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura is opting for a classic of classics.

1198
01:23:04,303 --> 01:23:12,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a just freaking, I don't want to say obvious choice, but just a choice that had to be here eventually.

1199
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:12,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Had to.

1200
01:23:13,527 --> 01:23:13,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

1201
01:23:15,208 --> 01:23:15,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1202
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:16,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So what did you pick for the kids tonight?

1203
01:23:16,949 --> 01:23:17,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Chrono Trigger.

1204
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:19,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

1205
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:22,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it's because Saw suggested it too.

1206
01:23:23,192 --> 01:23:27,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was going to speculate maybe it was tied into the recent announcement of the DS conversion.

1207
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:31,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to play the best music in the game.

1208
01:23:32,662 --> 01:23:34,264
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like my favorite music in the game.

1209
01:23:34,284 --> 01:23:35,366
[SPEAKER_04]: My second favorite music in the game.

1210
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:36,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it a little louder.

1211
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:36,567
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

1212
01:23:37,548 --> 01:23:38,810
It's the old palace music.

1213
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:39,371
Awesome.

1214
01:23:39,391 --> 01:23:40,212
Alright, go ahead.

1215
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:50,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it was a roleplay game that came out on the Super Nintendo, Super Famicom.

1216
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:56,983
[SPEAKER_04]: It was released in Japan on March 11, 1995 and August 22, 1995 in North America.

1217
01:23:58,444 --> 01:24:12,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually has, I think it's great they mentioned this, Square's Dream Team was behind it, which was Hironobu Sakaguchi, Kazuhiko Aoki, and Nobuo Uematsu, so that's pretty cool.

1218
01:24:13,175 --> 01:24:23,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the main artist behind the characters was Akira Toyama, who did the Dragon Quest series, and we better know for Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump.

1219
01:24:25,378 --> 01:24:28,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Now remember, water summons wind, and wind makes fire dance.

1220
01:24:29,999 --> 01:24:30,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it does.

1221
01:24:32,879 --> 01:24:34,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so, uh...

1222
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:47,929
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the musical score though was done by Yasunori Mitsuda who actually passed on his duties to Uematsu when he fell ill.

1223
01:24:49,029 --> 01:24:52,851
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of the way that this game played is that

1224
01:24:54,051 --> 01:24:58,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sort of an action slash sort of turn-based RPG.

1225
01:24:58,814 --> 01:25:01,955
[SPEAKER_04]: You could totally avoid some of the battles because you'd see the enemies hanging out.

1226
01:25:02,716 --> 01:25:10,140
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you wanted to go into the battle, you would run up to the creatures, they would spot you, and then your battle sequence would start.

1227
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:14,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And the style is actually sort of reminding me of later on in the Evolution series.

1228
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:15,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever play that?

1229
01:25:16,334 --> 01:25:17,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Evolution, and Grandia.

1230
01:25:33,915 --> 01:25:57,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you would have, um, you know, everyone had hit points, they would have magical weaknesses, but the really cool thing about this, and this is actually, it was called the Active Time Battle System, which, um, actually, uh, was designed for Final Fantasy IV, which we had over here as well, um, where you have a personal timer that's based on your character speed statistic.

1231
01:25:58,407 --> 01:26:18,264
[SPEAKER_04]: and you also get techs as your magic attack but the good thing about them is that you could combine your techs with other people once you you know use them enough and you would have like for example the antipode attacks it was the fire and ice attack remember that and you get different levels of those um or the uh

1232
01:26:19,562 --> 01:26:21,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I just remember Frog's giant bouncing frog.

1233
01:26:22,023 --> 01:26:22,603
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

1234
01:26:22,783 --> 01:26:24,063
[SPEAKER_04]: The giant bouncing frog was great.

1235
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:26,244
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually in this clip too, later on.

1236
01:26:26,684 --> 01:26:28,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not in this clip, but it was in another clip.

1237
01:26:28,985 --> 01:26:32,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, this person played through the entire freaking game and it's all on YouTube.

1238
01:26:32,385 --> 01:26:34,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Like 120 some odd parts.

1239
01:26:34,426 --> 01:26:34,926
[SPEAKER_09]: It's huge.

1240
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:36,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Like 15 minutes a piece.

1241
01:26:37,107 --> 01:26:37,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimaga Weapon.

1242
01:26:40,885 --> 01:26:51,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The other really neat example, by the way, is combining Chrono's Cyclone tech with Luka's Flame Toss to create Flame Whirl as their attack.

1243
01:26:52,436 --> 01:26:59,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the other cool thing is because you would guess by having Chrono in the title that it has to do with time, it did have time travel.

1244
01:27:00,003 --> 01:27:03,084
[SPEAKER_04]: You could go to the same place in time.

1245
01:27:04,324 --> 01:27:07,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a while you'd only have certain ways that you could do it.

1246
01:27:08,065 --> 01:27:11,286
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you progressed, you eventually got a ship that would let you go through time.

1247
01:27:12,086 --> 01:27:16,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And you would do different things through different parts of the game.

1248
01:27:16,787 --> 01:27:18,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best thing about it was New Game+.

1249
01:27:19,955 --> 01:27:30,540
[SPEAKER_04]: where you would start your game over with everything intact except for the special equipment that were part of the storyline to find, like the Masamune.

1250
01:27:32,301 --> 01:27:41,885
[SPEAKER_04]: The characters in it, you had Chrono, who was like your main guy, and his was the lightning-based attack, I do believe.

1251
01:27:42,365 --> 01:27:45,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had Luka, you had Marle...

1252
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:56,187
[SPEAKER_04]: You also had a bonus character, which was Magus, but you can either keep him or let him go, depending on whatever you said to him.

1253
01:27:57,628 --> 01:28:09,997
[SPEAKER_04]: You also had a bajillion different endings in this, and to refer to the actual... Super Nintendo version, sorry.

1254
01:28:10,517 --> 01:28:13,920
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually, I do believe that you had 14 endings, I want to say?

1255
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:14,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1256
01:28:15,737 --> 01:28:18,543
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was actually fairly sweet.

1257
01:28:18,663 --> 01:28:21,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Including one where you get to hang with the developers, which is kind of cool.

1258
01:28:21,088 --> 01:28:24,395
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was my favorite just because it was... Sorry about the high-pitched noise.

1259
01:28:24,415 --> 01:28:26,379
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the game they're transporting right now.

1260
01:28:28,348 --> 01:28:51,957
[SPEAKER_04]: but um it was just it was the game was epic and there was a PlayStation release that had I do believe an extra dungeon in it and also another ending plus it had animated cutscenes in it as far as the original release it actually did have

1261
01:28:57,267 --> 01:29:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Some pretty interesting innovations to the cartridge itself.

1262
01:29:04,636 --> 01:29:13,946
[SPEAKER_04]: There was, however, a bit of controversy that an unfinished version of the game had a ROM linked up on the internet.

1263
01:29:15,087 --> 01:29:15,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in 95.

1264
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:19,712
[SPEAKER_04]: That had music that was not used in the game.

1265
01:29:20,432 --> 01:29:22,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And a dungeon called the Singing Mountain.

1266
01:29:23,495 --> 01:29:29,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And another character that... There were other sprites for characters that never were used.

1267
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if we'll see that in the DS.

1268
01:29:31,263 --> 01:29:36,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I do want to say that I think that that level...

1269
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:39,392
[SPEAKER_04]: was used eventually.

1270
01:29:40,112 --> 01:29:43,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But I never played the PlayStation version, so don't quote me on that one.

1271
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:47,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, Chrono Cross was a true sequel to it.

1272
01:29:48,936 --> 01:29:58,200
[SPEAKER_04]: In one of the anime cutscenes that was for Chrono Cross, it led up to Luca finding the kid for Chrono Cross.

1273
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,420
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was sort of interesting.

1274
01:30:05,382 --> 01:30:12,011
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rumored also that Chrono Trigger is supposed to be coming on to Virtual Console.

1275
01:30:12,151 --> 01:30:15,956
[SPEAKER_04]: There is going to be a DS release.

1276
01:30:16,596 --> 01:30:19,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, in my opinion, means the Virtual Console one won't happen.

1277
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:23,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would they only make $15 off the Virtual Console one when they can charge $35.40 for the DS one?

1278
01:30:24,298 --> 01:30:26,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're going to innovate something, but it looks so far.

1279
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:31,063
[SPEAKER_04]: The trailer is actually up at chronotrigger.jp or .co.jp.

1280
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:34,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see it looks just the same.

1281
01:30:35,246 --> 01:30:39,089
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was another project that I don't know if you'd ever heard of called Chrono Resurrection.

1282
01:30:39,589 --> 01:30:39,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1283
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:42,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we covered it on the show like a while ago.

1284
01:30:42,451 --> 01:30:43,532
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it looked awesome.

1285
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:52,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and basically they were redoing the whole thing in 3D, and Squenix did release a cease and desist.

1286
01:30:52,763 --> 01:30:55,166
[SPEAKER_04]: There are supposed to be ROM hacks out there, but...

1287
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:03,783
[SPEAKER_04]: As to where you can find them, if someone can find them, let me know.

1288
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:05,983
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also plenty of good music.

1289
01:31:06,003 --> 01:31:11,344
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually an acid jazz soundtrack release.

1290
01:31:11,444 --> 01:31:12,405
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called Brink of Time.

1291
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:13,405
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually really good.

1292
01:31:13,525 --> 01:31:15,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I've listened to it.

1293
01:31:15,165 --> 01:31:20,586
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also the play concerts had some Chrono Trigger music in it.

1294
01:31:20,827 --> 01:31:22,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, there's the regular soundtrack.

1295
01:31:23,147 --> 01:31:34,039
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course you can find the there's an album called Time and Space a tribute to Yasunori Mitsuda and Chrono Symphonic which was released by Overclocked

1296
01:31:35,799 --> 01:31:36,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1297
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:37,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of stuff on Chrono Trigger.

1298
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And lots of fan art and stuff.

1299
01:31:40,241 --> 01:31:40,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a thought.

1300
01:31:40,841 --> 01:31:46,883
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how the rumor was going around that the Final Fantasy XI folks are supposed to be working on a new MMO that's not Final Fantasy?

1301
01:31:47,103 --> 01:31:50,184
[SPEAKER_09]: What if it was some type of Chrono Online RPG?

1302
01:31:50,224 --> 01:31:51,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it would work.

1303
01:31:51,285 --> 01:31:52,185
[SPEAKER_09]: There's more.

1304
01:31:52,425 --> 01:31:59,368
[SPEAKER_04]: The Satellaview had a release, a spin-off game called Chrono Trigger Jetpack Special, which is a minigame.

1305
01:31:59,988 --> 01:32:03,009
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole racing scene that I hated in Chrono Trigger.

1306
01:32:03,889 --> 01:32:04,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

1307
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:07,852
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also a 16-minute OAV.

1308
01:32:08,313 --> 01:32:13,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called Numano Monja Time and Space Adventures, which was...

1309
01:32:16,436 --> 01:32:23,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually downloaded it today, but I watched it all on YouTube earlier, and it's very silly, but it's got some funny stuff in it.

1310
01:32:24,001 --> 01:32:24,861
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually pretty cute.

1311
01:32:24,981 --> 01:32:33,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Radical Dreamers was like a scenario version.

1312
01:32:33,987 --> 01:32:38,570
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a side story to Chrono Trigger that came out on Citella View in 1996.

1313
01:32:40,191 --> 01:32:41,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1314
01:32:42,172 --> 01:32:43,733
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, your classic game of the week.

1315
01:32:44,687 --> 01:32:56,493
[SPEAKER_09]: been a long time coming, Chrono Trigger here on Orange Launch Radio for the Super Nintendo and soon to be a bunch of others, PlayStation I guess you could say and soon to be the DS who knows, maybe someday, if people get what they want, Virtual Console, there you have it

1316
01:32:57,941 --> 01:33:06,184
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, now we are going to go and take your calls on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1317
01:33:06,224 --> 01:33:14,466
[SPEAKER_09]: However, quickly, before we take calls, I want to say tonight, we really want to hear your predictions for E3, especially like Wild One.

1318
01:33:14,486 --> 01:33:19,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't name things that have already been somewhat confirmed, but what are your kind of predictions for E3 tonight?

1319
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:21,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1320
01:33:21,508 --> 01:33:21,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1321
01:33:22,909 --> 01:33:24,449
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the one and only Raven Stolfen.

1322
01:33:24,469 --> 01:33:25,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hello, one and only Raven Stolfen.

1323
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:26,470
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

1324
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:28,271
[SPEAKER_09]: DeadPixelLive.com

1325
01:33:51,741 --> 01:33:54,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there might be laws against him doing that in public.

1326
01:33:54,103 --> 01:33:54,503
[SPEAKER_09]: No, really.

1327
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:59,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything game-related you think that maybe hasn't been touched on that you think we'll see at E3?

1328
01:34:00,306 --> 01:34:01,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Or that you want to see?

1329
01:34:02,127 --> 01:34:02,668
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1330
01:34:02,788 --> 01:34:07,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to be the only one here, and I'm going to predict Wii Fit 2.

1331
01:34:08,371 --> 01:34:08,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Wii Fit 2?

1332
01:34:09,452 --> 01:34:10,052
[SPEAKER_09]: This early?

1333
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:10,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1334
01:34:10,893 --> 01:34:13,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think if we're going to get Wii Fit 2, we'd hear about it next E3.

1335
01:34:13,515 --> 01:34:14,175
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's just me.

1336
01:34:15,862 --> 01:34:19,065
[SPEAKER_01]: or some expansion of Wii Fit because it's good.

1337
01:34:19,165 --> 01:34:19,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.

1338
01:34:19,845 --> 01:34:20,586
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.

1339
01:34:21,026 --> 01:34:22,647
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's slim.

1340
01:34:22,748 --> 01:34:24,349
[SPEAKER_01]: So they need to put something out now.

1341
01:34:24,829 --> 01:34:25,230
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1342
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:30,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what do you think though if Animal Crossing and Punch-Out are their big flagship games for the Christmas season?

1343
01:34:30,934 --> 01:34:35,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Punch-Out with the balance board would be hot.

1344
01:34:36,258 --> 01:34:36,899
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be kind of fun.

1345
01:34:39,503 --> 01:34:42,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Blackwolf says they're going to announce when they actually put more Wii Fit on shelves.

1346
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:43,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I still can't find one.

1347
01:34:43,847 --> 01:34:44,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Me neither.

1348
01:34:45,028 --> 01:34:48,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried to look for it when I bought Civ Revolution and they didn't have it.

1349
01:34:48,652 --> 01:34:48,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad.

1350
01:34:48,912 --> 01:34:50,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I lost 20 pounds on Wii Fit.

1351
01:34:51,374 --> 01:34:52,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, really?

1352
01:34:53,136 --> 01:34:55,778
[SPEAKER_09]: See, ever since my pancreas issues, I've lost 30 pounds.

1353
01:34:55,818 --> 01:34:59,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just thinking, God, how much more could I lose if Wii Fit got in the picture, you know?

1354
01:35:00,262 --> 01:35:00,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1355
01:35:00,663 --> 01:35:01,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Crazy.

1356
01:35:02,224 --> 01:35:02,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

1357
01:35:02,664 --> 01:35:04,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other predictions for E3 this year?

1358
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:06,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Down with corporate radio, boo.

1359
01:35:29,345 --> 01:35:29,845
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing.

1360
01:35:29,966 --> 01:35:30,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

1361
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:34,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get the iPhone 3G and it's nice and fast.

1362
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:37,653
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, you should get Shazam for your iPhone.

1363
01:35:37,853 --> 01:35:38,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Shazam?

1364
01:35:38,494 --> 01:35:39,194
[SPEAKER_01]: What's Shazam?

1365
01:35:39,795 --> 01:35:41,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have anything to do with Captain Marvel?

1366
01:35:42,418 --> 01:35:44,019
[SPEAKER_01]: It does nothing to do with Captain Marvel.

1367
01:35:44,059 --> 01:35:48,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, say you're listening to a song and you have no idea what it is.

1368
01:35:50,345 --> 01:35:52,908
[SPEAKER_01]: The iPhone will listen to that song and tell you what it is.

1369
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:53,891
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

1370
01:35:53,911 --> 01:35:55,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what some of those Verizon phones are.

1371
01:35:55,471 --> 01:35:56,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've heard about the Verizon thing.

1372
01:35:57,072 --> 01:35:57,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's kind of neat.

1373
01:35:57,772 --> 01:36:02,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've got a real obscure song that I need a title to, so I may have to hit that up.

1374
01:36:03,273 --> 01:36:03,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait.

1375
01:36:04,033 --> 01:36:05,974
[SPEAKER_10]: You may have a usefulness for an Apple product?

1376
01:36:06,754 --> 01:36:11,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've tried those other services that listen to the song, and they can't figure it out.

1377
01:36:11,655 --> 01:36:12,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1378
01:36:12,575 --> 01:36:15,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you it probably only works with well-known songs.

1379
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:15,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm sure.

1380
01:36:16,016 --> 01:36:16,816
[SPEAKER_09]: If this is obscure enough.

1381
01:36:16,936 --> 01:36:17,216
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1382
01:36:17,236 --> 01:36:17,596
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

1383
01:36:17,636 --> 01:36:17,976
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

1384
01:36:18,916 --> 01:36:20,156
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why there's this radio station.

1385
01:36:20,176 --> 01:36:22,477
[SPEAKER_09]: The one radio station I will listen to in town.

1386
01:36:22,917 --> 01:36:30,302
[SPEAKER_09]: is completely DJ-free, and it plays the music I like, which is like 90s, 80s, and today music, but it's all kind of like alternative-y.

1387
01:36:30,642 --> 01:36:33,785
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the end of every song, they say the name and the artist.

1388
01:36:33,805 --> 01:36:42,290
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no DJs on the network, but there's this little robotic voice that will say, for instance, today I heard Duran Duran, The Reflex, which was awesome.

1389
01:36:43,331 --> 01:36:43,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

1390
01:36:43,771 --> 01:36:49,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it's an awesome radio station, I gotta say, which is funny because it used to be the dentist's office music station, but now it's pretty awesome.

1391
01:36:49,636 --> 01:36:50,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, any other quick thoughts?

1392
01:36:50,996 --> 01:36:51,317
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta go.

1393
01:36:52,377 --> 01:36:53,358
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing.

1394
01:36:53,578 --> 01:36:54,958
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing.

1395
01:36:55,038 --> 01:36:55,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing.

1396
01:36:56,599 --> 01:37:00,240
[SPEAKER_01]: The remote for the iPhone to control your iTunes is great.

1397
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:02,481
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is my favorite app.

1398
01:37:02,701 --> 01:37:07,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the application called Flashlight because I imagine you push a button and it just turns your screen white.

1399
01:37:07,823 --> 01:37:08,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Flashlight.

1400
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:09,823
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure is.

1401
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:13,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried that yet, but the iPhone is a flashlight.

1402
01:37:13,225 --> 01:37:13,945
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use that.

1403
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:15,345
[SPEAKER_09]: How about an OLR app?

1404
01:37:15,585 --> 01:37:17,546
[SPEAKER_09]: We need an OLR app on iPhone stat.

1405
01:37:19,007 --> 01:37:19,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you working on it?

1406
01:37:20,529 --> 01:37:34,259
[SPEAKER_09]: you are not working on it someone work on it for us and bring our text based game to iPhone we need iPhone's work iPhone's work alright we gotta let you go we want more predictions take care buddy good luck with Dead Pigs Alive hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

1407
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:41,385
[SPEAKER_09]: hey hey it's Ranma from New York you have been on the show too damn much recently but that's okay we love you how was the flight back?

1408
01:37:41,425 --> 01:37:41,645
[SPEAKER_09]: good?

1409
01:37:43,526 --> 01:37:49,571
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah there was a slight issue getting back but we'll save that for another time alright fair enough hey what are your predictions for E3?

1410
01:37:51,109 --> 01:38:20,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe I told you that last week and I'll say it again Reggie Fils-Aimé will come out on stage and not just cockslap everyone with his Wii as Raven Dolphin said he will announce Star Fox with twin sticks using the Wiimote and Nunchuck I could go for that there hasn't been any Star Fox loving on the Wii I could go for that that's a realistic prediction hell yes awesome anything else what about the other systems you Nintendo fanboy what about Xbox and Sony World

1411
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:36,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since they're doing this 60 gig thing, I see them coming out saying to everybody who bought a 360 in the past three months is getting a $50 rebate check and they're going to announce like 60 gig hard drives for pickup because I'm running out of space in my 360.

1412
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,191
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Guitar Hero and Rock Band in the house, so yeah.

1413
01:38:40,211 --> 01:38:40,291
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1414
01:38:58,376 --> 01:38:58,856
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1415
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:18,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Which would be my prediction.

1416
01:39:18,307 --> 01:39:27,852
[SPEAKER_09]: If you ask me my prediction for E3, I do think our friends, Reggie Fils-Aimé is going to come out and address that issue and make that other guy from Europe look like the jackass he is.

1417
01:39:27,992 --> 01:39:28,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope.

1418
01:39:28,913 --> 01:39:29,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope.

1419
01:39:30,174 --> 01:39:31,394
[SPEAKER_09]: That's plausible.

1420
01:39:31,414 --> 01:39:32,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually believe that one more.

1421
01:39:32,955 --> 01:39:34,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I will stand up and applaud.

1422
01:39:34,176 --> 01:39:37,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I can watch the Nintendo conference live, but I will stand up and applaud if I can.

1423
01:39:38,298 --> 01:39:42,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if we're lucky, Nintendo World will make an announcement like they did a couple years ago.

1424
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:45,062
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be doing a live feed of the press conference.

1425
01:39:45,593 --> 01:40:06,359
[SPEAKER_09]: look around on the internet, internet sites are doing it this year and I believe G4 is doing it again and supposedly learned their lesson about the commercial interruptions but honestly why watch it on G4, you can watch it on the internet probably be a lot I'm going to be stuck at work so I'm going to need some type of RSS feed I can guarantee that the Microsoft press conference will be on Xbox.com and it'll probably be on Microsoft's site they normally feed those

1426
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:15,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say, if I remember right, and I apologize if I'm misappropriating this because I'm going to be talking about someone else's show, but I watch Twitter and I follow other podcasters on Twitter.

1427
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:20,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say Gamertag Radio is running the Xbox conference, of course, because, you know, Gamertag, hello.

1428
01:40:21,403 --> 01:40:25,345
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think they're running the Nintendo one, too, on their site, so check it.

1429
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:26,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1430
01:40:26,205 --> 01:40:27,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I might definitely do that.

1431
01:40:27,725 --> 01:40:27,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1432
01:40:28,726 --> 01:40:29,126
[SPEAKER_09]: All righty.

1433
01:40:29,146 --> 01:40:29,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to let you go.

1434
01:40:29,806 --> 01:40:31,126
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to get more prediction calls, okay?

1435
01:40:31,587 --> 01:40:31,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

1436
01:40:31,807 --> 01:40:32,227
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

1437
01:40:32,267 --> 01:40:32,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Later, guys.

1438
01:40:32,567 --> 01:40:32,767
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1439
01:40:32,807 --> 01:40:33,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

1440
01:40:33,187 --> 01:40:33,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye, Jamie.

1441
01:40:33,707 --> 01:40:33,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1442
01:40:35,148 --> 01:40:35,308
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1443
01:40:35,328 --> 01:40:36,008
[SPEAKER_09]: No bye for Matt?

1444
01:40:37,386 --> 01:40:37,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1445
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:40,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you, Loki.

1446
01:40:40,651 --> 01:40:41,212
[SPEAKER_09]: You're alright, man.

1447
01:40:41,232 --> 01:40:41,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, bye.

1448
01:40:41,933 --> 01:40:42,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, Ranma.

1449
01:40:43,015 --> 01:40:45,579
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty good, I gotta say.

1450
01:40:45,959 --> 01:40:47,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1451
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:47,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1452
01:40:48,924 --> 01:40:49,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is

1453
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:52,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you're dropping out there a little bit, bud.

1454
01:40:52,257 --> 01:40:55,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure you got everything else shut off on your internets.

1455
01:40:56,038 --> 01:40:56,399
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1456
01:40:56,419 --> 01:40:57,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been having problems lately.

1457
01:40:57,959 --> 01:40:58,540
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1458
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it a try.

1459
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:01,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Quickly, what are your predictions for this year's E3?

1460
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:02,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Identify yourself, too.

1461
01:41:02,741 --> 01:41:03,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Who are you?

1462
01:41:03,682 --> 01:41:04,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1463
01:41:04,702 --> 01:41:06,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to say Gold Banjo.

1464
01:41:06,203 --> 01:41:06,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hello, Gold Banjo.

1465
01:41:06,983 --> 01:41:08,184
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you predicting for E3 this year?

1466
01:41:08,641 --> 01:41:09,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1467
01:41:10,763 --> 01:41:15,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm hoping for maybe an F-Zero Wii, but I don't know if it'll happen.

1468
01:41:16,169 --> 01:41:26,519
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a mighty fine prediction, and it may be a little bit fanboyish, but I'm with you on that, because I still will play F-Zero on the GameCube, F-Zero GX.

1469
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:28,762
[SPEAKER_09]: I love F-Zero.

1470
01:41:29,763 --> 01:41:31,204
[SPEAKER_09]: That is one of my favorite racing series.

1471
01:41:31,304 --> 01:41:31,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

1472
01:41:33,835 --> 01:41:37,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And what Ranma said, I guess I'm hoping for that too.

1473
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:43,843
[SPEAKER_03]: All the predictions so far are pretty good, so I don't know how many of them we'll see, but I'm excited about it.

1474
01:41:44,004 --> 01:41:46,266
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68 in chat says F-Zero is a dead series.

1475
01:41:46,406 --> 01:41:47,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope to hell you're wrong.

1476
01:41:47,887 --> 01:41:49,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're wrong, because I don't know about you, Loki.

1477
01:41:49,849 --> 01:41:50,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't you a big F-Zero fan too?

1478
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:54,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I love... That was only the last one, and it was alright.

1479
01:41:54,613 --> 01:42:00,338
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem with the arcade one, the only problem I had with the arcade one was the fact that it had like six tracks.

1480
01:42:00,638 --> 01:42:05,120
[SPEAKER_09]: But my god, the GameCube and the way it linked together was awesome.

1481
01:42:05,901 --> 01:42:08,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, I just... The only problem was finding an arcade cabinet.

1482
01:42:10,143 --> 01:42:10,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Is what?

1483
01:42:12,124 --> 01:42:13,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Finding an arcade cabinet.

1484
01:42:13,685 --> 01:42:15,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, true, true.

1485
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:17,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, any other quick predictions?

1486
01:42:17,427 --> 01:42:19,848
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of our callers are jumping right to Nintendo.

1487
01:42:19,868 --> 01:42:21,929
[SPEAKER_09]: What about Microsoft and Sony camps?

1488
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:22,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything you got there?

1489
01:42:24,851 --> 01:42:26,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a PS3 or a 360.

1490
01:42:27,792 --> 01:42:28,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So who cares?

1491
01:42:28,673 --> 01:42:29,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them, right?

1492
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:33,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one more thing about the F-Zero thing.

1493
01:42:33,477 --> 01:42:35,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure.

1494
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:37,545
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the F-Zero expansion pack, right?

1495
01:42:37,565 --> 01:42:39,088
[SPEAKER_03]: For that cancelled add-on for the N64?

1496
01:42:39,108 --> 01:42:39,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right, huh?

1497
01:42:42,427 --> 01:42:48,589
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a car and track editor, but yet they never added that into GX when it came out.

1498
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:51,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope that they would add that for the Wii.

1499
01:42:52,171 --> 01:42:55,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some track and car sharing and stuff.

1500
01:42:55,692 --> 01:42:56,472
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

1501
01:42:56,932 --> 01:42:57,733
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be pretty cool.

1502
01:42:58,273 --> 01:43:00,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go play some Xero GameCube tonight.

1503
01:43:01,935 --> 01:43:04,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my GameCube controller for Mega Man.

1504
01:43:04,957 --> 01:43:07,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a new memory card for the Mega Man game when I bought it.

1505
01:43:07,258 --> 01:43:09,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm itching to play some F-Zero.

1506
01:43:09,579 --> 01:43:10,179
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks a lot.

1507
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:11,800
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all good.

1508
01:43:12,941 --> 01:43:13,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1509
01:43:14,541 --> 01:43:15,342
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta let you go, buddy.

1510
01:43:15,542 --> 01:43:16,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care and happy E3.

1511
01:43:16,803 --> 01:43:17,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1512
01:43:18,103 --> 01:43:18,884
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

1513
01:43:18,904 --> 01:43:19,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1514
01:43:19,224 --> 01:43:19,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

1515
01:43:19,884 --> 01:43:23,406
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1516
01:43:23,466 --> 01:43:24,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1517
01:43:24,386 --> 01:43:24,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1518
01:43:26,147 --> 01:43:26,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, this is ActDeft.

1519
01:43:27,148 --> 01:43:27,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, ActDeft.

1520
01:43:27,748 --> 01:43:29,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I love your icon on Skype.

1521
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:30,589
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, it's a little Kirby chef.

1522
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:31,370
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

1523
01:43:33,191 --> 01:43:33,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, definitely.

1524
01:43:33,571 --> 01:43:33,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1525
01:43:33,691 --> 01:43:33,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two.

1526
01:43:33,952 --> 01:43:34,972
[SPEAKER_09]: One Nintendo-related, another Sony one.

1527
01:43:35,092 --> 01:43:38,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, my Sony one is Sniper 4 for the PlayStation 3.

1528
01:43:38,475 --> 01:43:39,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe a PSP game.

1529
01:43:39,175 --> 01:43:39,635
[SPEAKER_09]: A what for the PS3?

1530
01:44:01,537 --> 01:44:02,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Sly Cooper.

1531
01:44:03,338 --> 01:44:03,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1532
01:44:04,378 --> 01:44:04,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Sly Cooper.

1533
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:06,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool, okay.

1534
01:44:07,239 --> 01:44:09,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So some game announcements, that's good.

1535
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:12,601
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely hope that it's going to be announced, though.

1536
01:44:13,241 --> 01:44:14,301
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a far shot.

1537
01:44:14,922 --> 01:44:16,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Any reason why you're going for Sly Cooper?

1538
01:44:17,663 --> 01:44:23,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe because I'm a fan of the series.

1539
01:44:24,005 --> 01:44:27,366
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really hope that this time it's going to be announced.

1540
01:44:27,822 --> 01:44:30,967
[SPEAKER_09]: No reason you can't have a little fanboyism in your predictions.

1541
01:44:30,987 --> 01:44:31,708
[SPEAKER_09]: What about Nintendo?

1542
01:44:33,951 --> 01:44:37,255
[SPEAKER_11]: A new Kirby game for the Wii.

1543
01:44:37,456 --> 01:44:39,058
[SPEAKER_09]: So your icon's not just a clever icon.

1544
01:44:39,078 --> 01:44:43,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool, although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately.

1545
01:44:45,768 --> 01:44:53,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the Kirby franchise needs a new, definitely new game, like a lift-off.

1546
01:44:53,594 --> 01:44:58,938
[SPEAKER_09]: That Kirby drawing game on the DS might be kind of fun on the Wii.

1547
01:44:58,978 --> 01:45:00,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually like that game quite a bit.

1548
01:45:00,339 --> 01:45:03,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember, Touch All-Stars, I like that game, it was fun.

1549
01:45:03,541 --> 01:45:12,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, one of my predictions on the forums for this year was going to be a port or a new game using that same gameplay.

1550
01:45:13,007 --> 01:45:16,808
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope Nintendo announces this E3.

1551
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:18,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we'll see.

1552
01:45:18,129 --> 01:45:20,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, any other quick last thoughts before we get to some more predictions?

1553
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:25,591
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just thanks on the question for Tomotaro Riko.

1554
01:45:26,531 --> 01:45:27,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, no problem.

1555
01:45:28,332 --> 01:45:29,852
[SPEAKER_09]: This show is not just about the three of us.

1556
01:45:29,912 --> 01:45:30,693
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about the listeners.

1557
01:45:30,893 --> 01:45:34,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we can ask questions that we know our listeners will want to hear, we ask them.

1558
01:45:36,715 --> 01:45:37,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

1559
01:45:37,055 --> 01:45:37,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care, buddy.

1560
01:45:39,995 --> 01:45:41,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it does get back to them, by the way.

1561
01:45:41,576 --> 01:45:44,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this will be our last call, then we're going to call it a night because we're running pretty long.

1562
01:45:44,678 --> 01:45:45,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1563
01:45:45,819 --> 01:45:46,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1564
01:45:46,919 --> 01:45:47,620
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68.

1565
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:48,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hello.

1566
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:48,921
[SPEAKER_09]: You got through.

1567
01:45:49,121 --> 01:45:50,782
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your predictions for E3, buddy?

1568
01:45:52,623 --> 01:46:02,269
[SPEAKER_00]: The boys of Calamity and Harmonix duke it out over the whole Rock Battle lawsuit, and it's a myth that an arcade game gets announced at E3 and the whole universe dies.

1569
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:10,748
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you suggesting that Konami should bring back their Rumble Roses models from a few E3s ago and they can duke it out in Cream Corn or Jell-O Wrestling?

1570
01:46:11,519 --> 01:46:12,800
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was joking.

1571
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:14,581
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't.

1572
01:46:14,641 --> 01:46:27,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, like you and some of the cars have said, maybe Nintendo will address the storage space to some sort of attachment to the Wii that plugs into the USB drive or something.

1573
01:46:27,648 --> 01:46:32,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just a patch that they could release overnight that'll let the USB drives work.

1574
01:46:32,331 --> 01:46:33,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, call it a hunch.

1575
01:46:34,508 --> 01:46:38,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, freaking Super Mario RPG gets it released on Virtual Console.

1576
01:46:39,532 --> 01:46:41,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, now there's a good fanboy prediction.

1577
01:46:41,573 --> 01:46:43,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console.

1578
01:46:43,295 --> 01:46:44,316
[SPEAKER_09]: We know it's coming eventually, right?

1579
01:46:44,336 --> 01:46:45,376
[SPEAKER_09]: We heard the Japanese one.

1580
01:46:45,737 --> 01:46:49,299
[SPEAKER_09]: So you would think if it's coming out in Japan, it's got to come out here eventually.

1581
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:49,880
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

1582
01:46:50,961 --> 01:46:52,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1583
01:46:52,262 --> 01:46:53,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other predictions, sir?

1584
01:46:56,185 --> 01:46:57,886
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the Sony and Microsoft end of things?

1585
01:46:59,981 --> 01:47:06,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't really know because the only next-gen console I have is a Wii.

1586
01:47:06,605 --> 01:47:11,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like selling a lot of money for a 360 or PS3 at the moment.

1587
01:47:11,908 --> 01:47:15,590
[SPEAKER_09]: How about, okay, I'll give you a fanboy one because I would love to see this someday.

1588
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:23,874
[SPEAKER_09]: How about a company announces in partnership with either Microsoft or Sony a localized version of WANGAM Midnight Maximum Tune for consoles?

1589
01:47:25,335 --> 01:47:25,815
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I...

1590
01:47:27,586 --> 01:47:32,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, that game seems like the kind of game that I'd rather play in arcades.

1591
01:47:32,788 --> 01:47:36,149
[SPEAKER_10]: The PS3 version of Wind Game Midnight sucks balls.

1592
01:47:36,169 --> 01:47:37,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's a different thing.

1593
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:39,191
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not related to the actual arcade series.

1594
01:47:39,511 --> 01:47:46,553
[SPEAKER_10]: That game's based on... It is based off the arcade series, but the problem is it's a port of a PlayStation 1 game, I think.

1595
01:47:47,974 --> 01:47:53,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it's based off... It and the original Wind Game Midnight arcade game were...

1596
01:47:53,806 --> 01:47:57,889
[SPEAKER_00]: based on Tokyo Extreme Racer for the PS2 or Dreamcast.

1597
01:47:59,230 --> 01:48:01,212
[SPEAKER_09]: So the magic just belongs in the arcades.

1598
01:48:01,472 --> 01:48:02,393
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't need to be brought home.

1599
01:48:03,153 --> 01:48:06,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some things in the arc... I mean, that's what the arcade needs.

1600
01:48:06,816 --> 01:48:09,919
[SPEAKER_00]: More things that you can only experience in the arcade.

1601
01:48:09,999 --> 01:48:16,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these days you can just easily port shmups and fighters to the consoles and PCs.

1602
01:48:16,864 --> 01:48:17,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

1603
01:48:17,365 --> 01:48:18,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you that, sir.

1604
01:48:18,505 --> 01:48:20,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to wrap it up, GS68, but thanks for the call.

1605
01:48:20,787 --> 01:48:21,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, okay?

1606
01:48:22,008 --> 01:48:22,328
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

1607
01:48:22,429 --> 01:48:22,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, later.

1608
01:48:24,042 --> 01:48:25,724
[SPEAKER_09]: We will see what happens at E3.

1609
01:48:25,784 --> 01:48:27,185
[SPEAKER_09]: It all starts this week.

1610
01:48:27,686 --> 01:48:28,367
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be awesome.

1611
01:48:29,468 --> 01:48:33,212
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime though, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up the show tonight.

1612
01:48:33,492 --> 01:48:35,014
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

1613
01:48:37,476 --> 01:48:39,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Think for yourself and learn to be offended.

1614
01:48:41,043 --> 01:48:43,344
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I want a Hot Pocket.

1615
01:48:43,884 --> 01:48:44,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

1616
01:48:44,584 --> 01:48:47,064
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I have a bunch of last-minute stories.

1617
01:48:47,424 --> 01:48:48,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, we never get to last-minute stories.

1618
01:48:48,625 --> 01:48:48,905
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1619
01:48:48,925 --> 01:48:50,065
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, last-minute stories then.

1620
01:48:50,345 --> 01:48:51,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, real quick.

1621
01:48:52,365 --> 01:48:54,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Madden Soundtracks coming to Rock Band's download content.

1622
01:48:54,666 --> 01:48:55,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's kind of cool.

1623
01:48:55,546 --> 01:48:56,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I leave that off the show roll?

1624
01:48:56,766 --> 01:48:57,126
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

1625
01:48:57,406 --> 01:48:57,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1626
01:48:58,147 --> 01:48:58,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a dummy.

1627
01:48:58,667 --> 01:48:58,887
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1628
01:48:59,907 --> 01:49:08,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Onichanbara, that game with the chick in lingerie and a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword, is coming to the Wii in the U.S.

1629
01:49:09,009 --> 01:49:09,229
[SPEAKER_10]: now.

1630
01:49:09,949 --> 01:49:12,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck yeah, that's awesome.

1631
01:49:13,132 --> 01:49:16,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's one of my predictions to come out of V3.

1632
01:49:16,556 --> 01:49:27,268
[SPEAKER_10]: That there's going to be a software patch for the Wii that will allow you to use the Wii Classic controller or perhaps this brand new trademark patented controller that Nintendo will be putting out.

1633
01:49:27,968 --> 01:49:28,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1634
01:49:28,649 --> 01:49:29,129
[SPEAKER_10]: GameCube Controllers

1635
01:49:50,666 --> 01:49:53,587
[SPEAKER_10]: That's supposedly going to debut on Xbox Live Arcade tomorrow.

1636
01:49:54,947 --> 01:50:00,069
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also a rumor that they're going to surprise us with Geometry Wars Retrovolve 2.

1637
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:03,270
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be the surprise thing tomorrow.

1638
01:50:04,070 --> 01:50:11,513
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a couple other games that they mentioned as well, including... I don't know where to go here.

1639
01:50:13,976 --> 01:50:18,038
[SPEAKER_10]: There was some other crosswords game that's going to be coming out.

1640
01:50:18,638 --> 01:50:20,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, I don't know, that didn't look too exciting at all.

1641
01:50:20,619 --> 01:50:21,540
[SPEAKER_09]: They did announce that, though.

1642
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:22,400
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really happening.

1643
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:23,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's really happening.

1644
01:50:24,661 --> 01:50:28,123
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was also some other game.

1645
01:50:28,743 --> 01:50:29,724
[SPEAKER_10]: A shooter game.

1646
01:50:29,944 --> 01:50:31,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Shred Nebula.

1647
01:50:32,345 --> 01:50:39,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I would not want to be crappy crosswords game in the week that Duke Nukem or Geometry Wars 2 or these other rumored things get released.

1648
01:50:39,548 --> 01:50:40,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1649
01:50:40,789 --> 01:50:40,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1650
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:44,359
[SPEAKER_10]: There's one thing I do know.

1651
01:50:44,879 --> 01:50:49,645
[SPEAKER_10]: There was an article this week about Blazing Lizard.

1652
01:50:50,285 --> 01:50:53,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess they're being represented by Flashman Studios.

1653
01:50:53,469 --> 01:51:00,958
[SPEAKER_10]: You may not know who Blazing Lizard is, but they're the ones behind Pirates vs. Ninja Dodgeball on Xbox Live Arcade.

1654
01:51:02,026 --> 01:51:04,127
[SPEAKER_10]: and they have an unannounced title for the Wii.

1655
01:51:05,027 --> 01:51:09,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what that game is by chance and it actually is Pirates vs. Ninja Dodgeball.

1656
01:51:10,388 --> 01:51:13,389
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming to the Wii now too.

1657
01:51:14,569 --> 01:51:15,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1658
01:51:16,029 --> 01:51:19,030
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a pretty cool game coming out called I Heart Geeks.

1659
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:23,891
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a rude Goldberg puzzle game kind of like in The Incredible Machine.

1660
01:51:23,911 --> 01:51:24,951
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of neat.

1661
01:51:26,082 --> 01:51:41,709
[SPEAKER_10]: and apparently there are some leaks out of Sony's support site about upcoming titles including Punisher Warzone for the PS3 and Maxim Pinball, Cinnamon Beats, Alien Sports Minigolf, and Under Fire.

1662
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:43,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of interesting.

1663
01:51:44,231 --> 01:51:46,452
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be a new Wolfenstein game at E3 this year.

1664
01:51:46,572 --> 01:51:50,594
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, that's already in the new Game Informer magazine, so check that out.

1665
01:51:50,674 --> 01:51:51,074
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty cool.

1666
01:51:52,305 --> 01:52:03,377
[SPEAKER_10]: and also rumored that Rock Band 2 setlist includes Guns N' Roses and the Chinese Democracy Trek.

1667
01:52:05,839 --> 01:52:08,141
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a pretty awesome little surprise.

1668
01:52:09,102 --> 01:52:10,144
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be very interesting.

1669
01:52:11,225 --> 01:52:14,468
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's all I really want to talk about right now.

1670
01:52:15,502 --> 01:52:15,883
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1671
01:52:16,664 --> 01:52:17,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1672
01:52:17,766 --> 01:52:18,187
[SPEAKER_10]: One more thing.

1673
01:52:18,207 --> 01:52:18,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1674
01:52:18,447 --> 01:52:18,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

1675
01:52:18,928 --> 01:52:20,230
[SPEAKER_10]: This is completely Raven's Dolphin.

1676
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:20,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1677
01:52:20,611 --> 01:52:26,020
[SPEAKER_10]: This is completely random, but I saw there was this list that was on game trailers.

1678
01:52:26,361 --> 01:52:28,785
[SPEAKER_10]: It's eight extremely embarrassing E3 moments.

1679
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:32,598
[SPEAKER_10]: And the one that they have in the very beginning on here is Jamie Kennedy.

1680
01:52:32,878 --> 01:52:39,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember his Activision little spiel last year was completely embarrassing and he wasn't very funny.

1681
01:52:39,283 --> 01:52:41,384
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually met Jamie Kennedy this Wednesday.

1682
01:52:41,625 --> 01:52:43,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a picture with him, actually.

1683
01:52:43,226 --> 01:52:44,427
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty crappy.

1684
01:52:44,567 --> 01:52:46,648
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a new autograph for our autograph wall.

1685
01:52:46,949 --> 01:52:47,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray.

1686
01:52:47,389 --> 01:52:48,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1687
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:49,451
[SPEAKER_09]: He's actually pretty funny in person.

1688
01:52:49,511 --> 01:52:52,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to put the Freeze Pop autograph up, by the way, that Ranma got me for my birthday.

1689
01:52:53,654 --> 01:52:54,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm digging that new Freeze Pop album.

1690
01:52:55,375 --> 01:52:56,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it's pretty fun.

1691
01:52:56,656 --> 01:52:56,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1692
01:52:57,757 --> 01:52:58,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, your final thought, Loki.

1693
01:52:59,658 --> 01:53:03,560
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is I hopefully will finish OLR PSP this week.

1694
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:06,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I know my wife is really hating that I'm working on this.

1695
01:53:07,822 --> 01:53:10,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you want to change your final thought, DarkSakura, since it's been so long?

1696
01:53:10,864 --> 01:53:11,024
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1697
01:53:11,404 --> 01:53:15,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and I will agree with GameGuru on a last final thought.

1698
01:53:15,986 --> 01:53:16,587
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 better rock.

1699
01:53:17,543 --> 01:53:19,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree, especially since we're not there to party away.

1700
01:53:38,564 --> 01:53:41,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Until next time, we'll be back next week with all of the E3 news.

1701
01:53:42,187 --> 01:53:46,371
[SPEAKER_09]: And if anything especially strikes us, we may go live midweek.

1702
01:53:46,451 --> 01:53:46,932
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1703
01:53:47,072 --> 01:53:50,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Not live, but a tape thing because we can't invade other all-game show space.

1704
01:53:50,475 --> 01:53:51,896
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe something midweek.

1705
01:53:51,996 --> 01:53:52,377
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1706
01:53:52,977 --> 01:53:54,659
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, I'm Rob Roberts.

1707
01:53:55,339 --> 01:53:56,020
[SPEAKER_09]: She's DarkSakura.

1708
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:56,520
[SPEAKER_09]: He's Loki.

1709
01:53:56,981 --> 01:53:57,842
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is Orange Launch Radio.

1710
01:53:58,502 --> 01:54:01,303
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1711
01:54:01,804 --> 01:54:05,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1712
01:54:05,485 --> 01:54:14,109
[SPEAKER_07]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

1713
01:54:14,629 --> 01:54:26,214
[SPEAKER_07]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.
