1
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:19,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, August 3, 2008, will Nintendo's latest move in court stop DS piracy?

2
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:22,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Jet Set Radio making a comeback on the Wii?

3
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:27,101
[SPEAKER_07]: And rumors abound about the Xbox 360 getting a price cut next month.

4
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:33,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

5
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:35,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,584
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:42,765
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:46,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:47,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Roar.

10
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:48,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Roar.

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Beware, I hunger.

12
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,612
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm not hunger.

13
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:54,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm full of tasty epic salad.

14
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:56,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we should not beware.

15
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:58,297
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be... Oh, you should beware.

16
00:00:59,178 --> 00:00:59,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Beware of what?

17
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:00,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Beware of what?

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:01,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

19
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:05,224
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:30,599
[SPEAKER_13]: My mistake.

21
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,840
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't think a milkshake is a part of a good diet.

22
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, milkshakes can be very good for you if you do them right.

23
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:38,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I doubt Jack in the Box does them the healthy way.

24
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:39,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Call it a hunch.

25
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:45,107
[SPEAKER_09]: With no sugar added ice cream and protein powder and low fat milk.

26
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:47,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's only half bad.

27
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:49,139
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very healthy.

28
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Give good dairy.

29
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I just finished my nutrition class.

30
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Foodio, everybody.

31
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:55,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to it.

32
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:57,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's talk about games.

33
00:01:57,942 --> 00:02:00,143
[SPEAKER_04]: We always start off the show with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week.

34
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:02,184
[SPEAKER_04]: First, though, let me introduce the one and only chat room.

35
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:07,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be if you're listening live on this Sunday evening, August 3rd of 2008, for our 290th show.

36
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,509
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

37
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:34,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty, yes.

38
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, this has been the last week of class.

39
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:39,587
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fair question, yes or no?

40
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:39,987
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

41
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:45,749
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been the last week of class for me, so I actually took my final on Saturday morning and then played.

42
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:46,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I took a hooky day, though.

43
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,650
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you do with hooky day?

44
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Watched movies.

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,670
[SPEAKER_04]: But you didn't play Soul Calibur, fail.

46
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:53,411
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I didn't.

47
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:53,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

48
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:57,052
[SPEAKER_09]: But, but, but, but, but, I did play some Portal.

49
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:58,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And how was that?

50
00:02:58,752 --> 00:02:59,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Portal-rific.

51
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:00,132
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

52
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:01,913
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, Ragnarok.

53
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a story just for you later tonight.

54
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:07,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I downloaded a game for my phone.

55
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:09,044
[SPEAKER_09]: I downloaded a Sudoku game.

56
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:11,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing Sudoku on my phone.

57
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:12,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

58
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:15,369
[SPEAKER_04]: How bored have you been on a scale of 1 to 10?

59
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:16,429
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually kind of fun.

60
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind you can only use each number once.

61
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:19,272
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually kind of fun.

62
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for something when you've got three minutes to kill.

63
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Sudoku is a huge time waster.

64
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:27,798
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's it.

65
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:28,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a time waster.

66
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:32,647
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're looking to waste time, at least try to put your brain to work, right?

67
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's what most any game's for, right?

68
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:36,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

69
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:37,949
[SPEAKER_09]: What about this show?

70
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait a minute.

71
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it for your gaming week?

72
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Rob.

73
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:44,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?

74
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't play that many games this week, actually.

75
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:50,575
[SPEAKER_13]: I only played Grand Theft Auto 4.

76
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:53,597
[SPEAKER_13]: I meant to play a bunch of stuff this week, but never got around to it.

77
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:54,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Grand Theft Auto 4 and...

78
00:03:57,762 --> 00:04:00,105
[SPEAKER_13]: The Shit Game, but we'll talk about that later.

79
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:13,557
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

80
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:14,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much fun.

81
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:43,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

82
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:01,450
[SPEAKER_04]: have the bonus characters, Yoda and Starkiller.

83
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,193
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't use them, or the Apprentice, as he's called in the game, which makes him sound like a Donald Trump flunky.

84
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:11,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But Starkiller from The Force Unleashed, you can't customize characters based off of them, which sucks.

85
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:19,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would have loved to have made... I can understand Yoda, because it's kind of hard to base characters off Yoda, unless you can have midget fighters.

86
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Which would be an awesome fighting game, by the way.

87
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:26,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just thinking that you should totally make your Final Fantasy XI character, Lil' Kim...

88
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:31,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I could, but only if I could do Yoda, because she was very tiny.

89
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:32,606
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was going to say.

90
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:34,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you could do the midget size.

91
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:37,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I made Sassy Pants, my Warcraft character.

92
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:38,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I made her based off Young Sung.

93
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:40,888
[SPEAKER_04]: She's the chick with the giant afro, and she's quite sassy.

94
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And very cool.

95
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:50,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also made a male guy based off of... He kind of looks like Robin from the old school, because he has the little mask and very vibrant colors.

96
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,491
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's based off of Tira, who's the hula hoop girl.

97
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:53,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

98
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:57,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I love customization modes.

99
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:57,984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

100
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:00,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only reason why I would play wrestling games.

101
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,568
[SPEAKER_04]: To make my own character.

102
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,010
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

103
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:45,279
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, we had a lot of fun playing Soul Calibur.

104
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the things I don't like about Soul Calibur.

105
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually like the Star Wars characters.

106
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:53,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why people are so like, oh, they throw things off balance.

107
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:58,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been that hardcore into Soul Calibur, so I don't study the game mechanics or the science.

108
00:06:58,808 --> 00:06:59,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's fun.

109
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:00,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Deal.

110
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:03,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I especially think Starkiller is a great, great character.

111
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:04,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I love playing as him.

112
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:07,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's awesome to get in the game.

113
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:08,775
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, if you want to unlock him, you have to...

114
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:11,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Beat Arcade Mode with Yoda or I imagine Vader on the 360.

115
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:12,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

116
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:17,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's a great addition on the PS3.

117
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:19,845
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like playing as him.

118
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:20,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the new characters.

119
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,646
[SPEAKER_04]: What I don't like, I don't like the single player modes.

120
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Story mode is very, very short, which is fine because it doesn't need to go on forever.

121
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:39,309
[SPEAKER_04]: But climbing the tower up and down mode, which is basically just an excuse to fight five people all at once in a row and unlock...

122
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:40,890
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

123
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I am hearing, and I do see it a little bit, that some of the game mechanics of some of the old characters kind of got screwed up a little bit.

124
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:08,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for instance, Shaoran in chat, Shaoran, sorry, says Talim got slightly less hot between 2 and 3, and she plays a little different, too.

125
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ivy, I noticed, especially, plays, like, different.

126
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:12,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to explain.

127
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:16,741
[SPEAKER_04]: But some characters I still have a lot of fun with, like Zalasamel.

128
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:17,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I love him.

129
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:18,041
[SPEAKER_04]: He's awesome.

130
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:19,882
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make one that's more foul than Voldo.

131
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,192
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably possible.

132
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:25,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the other interesting thing about the Soul Calibur.

133
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:30,699
[SPEAKER_04]: The online content, some of it is available and you can download for just 100 Microsoft points.

134
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:36,144
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get some extra customization, which is basically like old costumes.

135
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:40,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cool thing is you can actually customize the existing characters, like change the colors of their outfits and stuff.

136
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:41,630
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

137
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pay to unlock content, though.

138
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:44,692
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

139
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:08,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

140
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 on the Xbox 360

141
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:05,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, I would say, is the best game on Xbox Live Arcade right now.

142
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great.

143
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:14,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though they upped the price from $5 to $10, I think it's a heck of a deal because you get six different modes in the game.

144
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:17,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been playing pacifism mode so much.

145
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:21,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that mode is fun, and it's weird because you don't even shoot in that mode.

146
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,879
[SPEAKER_04]: You just fly around the screen dodging enemies.

147
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:33,003
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's so disgustingly simple, like the old Atari 2600 games and the old 80s games that was just, you know, shoot things, don't get hit.

148
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:33,523
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

149
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:34,243
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so simple.

150
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:38,385
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the reasons I think I love Geometry Wars, is it really kind of, kind of...

151
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:44,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, kind of recalls those days of the past with these very simple video games.

152
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:47,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And you practically have like six different games in a way kind of in there.

153
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really like the way they've incorporated the leaderboard into the game.

154
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:53,682
[SPEAKER_04]: They've basically made the game all about beating your friends.

155
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: The achievements are interesting.

156
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:58,404
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a lot easier to get than they were in Geometry Wars 1.

157
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:03,125
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, you know, like for instance, there's these two achievements, Wax On and Wax Off.

158
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:04,786
[SPEAKER_04]: And you do it in pacifism mode.

159
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:05,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And you...

160
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:10,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Wax On is circling around the screen touching every wall.

161
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:18,335
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you start to do it, then the game realizes you're going through the achievement and it starts lighting up the wall on how much of it you've circled.

162
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:24,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Wax Off is doing the same thing twice, which is kind of hard to do when pacifism mode gets going.

163
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:24,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So I

164
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pretty impressed by how they kind of worked in the achievements.

165
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:31,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that they made it very competitive with a friend's leaderboard.

166
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:39,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to try multiplayer, which sadly is not on Xbox Live because we all know that's what they're going to do for Retro Evolved 3, I'm sure, to make that fresh.

167
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:41,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Retro Evolved 2

168
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:04,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great.

169
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:06,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly recommend Geometry Wars 2.

170
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:09,924
[SPEAKER_04]: If you even like shooters in the slightest, it's a great deal at $10.

171
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:12,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the price went up, but you get six different games now.

172
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth it.

173
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:14,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

174
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:15,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Highly, highly recommend.

175
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:42,118
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's besides Final Fantasy 4 and Warcraft and the usual affair that's pretty much it for my gaming week but those two are the new new games I've been playing looking at comments in the chat room GS68 says Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 sequence mode is reminding me of Giga Wing Son of Dad says Giga Wing should be on Xbox Live Arcade along with Mars Matrix as if there weren't enough shooters on Xbox Live Arcade Mars Matrix was a cool game though

176
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about that.

177
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:47,023
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to... I've got it somewhere.

178
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:48,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to hook up the Dreamcast.

179
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:49,106
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

180
00:12:49,627 --> 00:12:50,208
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to do that.

181
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:54,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's talk about a little bit of housekeeping tonight.

182
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:59,794
[SPEAKER_04]: First off in housekeeping, it is All Games Listener Appreciation Month.

183
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:05,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And during All Games Listener Appreciation Month, we're going to be giving away free shit to our listeners.

184
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:16,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, you're going to win tokens this month that will allow you to basically kind of enter a larger contest going on at allgames.com where you can win prizes.

185
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:19,180
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking about giving away like game systems and games.

186
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:19,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

187
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:46,685
[SPEAKER_04]: We will not be live in two weeks since this is housekeeping.

188
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,166
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be no live show Sunday, August 17th.

189
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:53,047
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first time actually the folks in studio are hearing about this too.

190
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:54,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise, Loki and DarkSakura.

191
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:55,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard about it earlier.

192
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:57,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because you were here nice and early this week.

193
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:58,229
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because I was.

194
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:02,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to fill you in, but Loki ran through the door at the last minute and I neglected to tell him.

195
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Last minute, but like a half an hour.

196
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:05,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I forgot.

197
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:05,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

198
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:06,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

199
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:13,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't talk about my personal life too much, but this is too funny to pass up.

200
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been seeing William for a year and a half now.

201
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:18,137
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing about William and I is that we're both really big nerds.

202
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:24,839
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually spent our first anniversary, we actually drove down to Long Beach and went to the Star Trek tour at the Queen Mary.

203
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,319
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how big nerds we are.

204
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:27,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

205
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We've always talked about how we're going to go to the Star Trek experience because I haven't been since I was 25.

206
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Right before I started working at my current job, so it was about seven years ago.

207
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,723
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a long time ago when I was last at the Star Trek experience.

208
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:43,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And we keep talking about how we're going to go back, we're going to go back, because I've never ridden the Borg 4D ride.

209
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:49,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then I read on the internet last night they are shutting down the Star Trek experience on September 1st.

210
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:51,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is so sad.

211
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they would shut that down.

212
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:54,669
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so cool.

213
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,373
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really lit a fire under our ass to go to the Star Trek experience before it closes.

214
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:10,821
[SPEAKER_04]: But because of Penny Arcade Expo, because of some other commitment I have in Reno in three weeks, because of the fact there's a huge convention in Vegas next week, it really only made sense.

215
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,202
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to go to Vegas in two weeks.

216
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:15,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So we booked a trip and we're going to Vegas in two weeks.

217
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:16,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Very last minute trip.

218
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:17,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the...

219
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:19,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Various websites online.

220
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:24,108
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, I am a giant nerd going to the Star Trek experience in Vegas in two weeks.

221
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:25,208
[SPEAKER_04]: So there won't be a live show.

222
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:26,188
[SPEAKER_04]: We might pre-tape something.

223
00:15:26,228 --> 00:15:26,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know yet.

224
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd.

225
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:29,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

226
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:36,791
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, for the record, folks, the first thing that DarkSakura said to me, I want to go.

227
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

228
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:40,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not want to go.

229
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:44,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been on the Borg ride.

230
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf says they're shutting it down because Star Trek is irrelevant these days.

231
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:48,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Bite your tongue.

232
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,963
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that new movie coming out.

233
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:52,643
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an awful thing to say.

234
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:53,524
[SPEAKER_09]: You take that back.

235
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:55,204
[SPEAKER_04]: You take that back, Bobby Blackwolf.

236
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:56,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

237
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,465
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be in Vegas.

238
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:02,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf says, I actually tried to see if I could get to Vegas this month too.

239
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:04,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've never seen the Star Trek experience.

240
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:04,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha!

241
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:10,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so two weeks and we'll fill you in more on what's going to happen that week.

242
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:14,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if DarkSakura and Loki are going to do a show or if we'll pre-tape something or what we're going to do.

243
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:15,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

244
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:17,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just burn things live on air.

245
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

246
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,741
[SPEAKER_04]: The Burnination Show.

247
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that'd be great.

248
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:21,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Fuck Show.

249
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:22,664
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't do the Fuck Show without me.

250
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:23,284
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't do the Fuck Show.

251
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:23,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

252
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:25,306
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't do the Fuck Show until we're all here.

253
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:26,047
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you can't do it without me.

254
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:26,788
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do it without me.

255
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:30,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it for pretty much housekeeping.

256
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, join our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio.

257
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:35,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Join our Facebook, OL Army, our live journal, Orange Lounge.

258
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:37,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Where else are we, Social Horde?

259
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a new one!

260
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:44,989
[SPEAKER_04]: If you check out the Orange Lounge Radio forums, the OL Archive has been built.

261
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:50,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this, I don't know, they use SkyDrive or some website where you can share masses of big files.

262
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:57,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I am a generous, nice, kind, giving person, I actually uploaded 20 old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

263
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:05,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Old, moldy, stanky episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, like episode 20 through 40, I think, are up there on the OL Archive.

264
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:07,648
[SPEAKER_04]: along with some other old school Orange Lens Radio stuff.

265
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:11,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to warn you in advance, it was a much different show five years ago.

266
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:13,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So, be warned.

267
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:18,117
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're expecting the same stuff you hear now, it's even worse, if you can believe it.

268
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:19,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it, the OL Archive.

269
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,139
[SPEAKER_04]: More information available in our forums.

270
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, enough whoring ourselves out, let's get to some gaming news.

271
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:32,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, this week Nintendo, along with 54 other developers, filed lawsuit against or

272
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, a lawsuit against the makers of the R4 device.

273
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:42,477
[SPEAKER_13]: As well as, I'm assuming they're going to try to expand it, you know, against all the devices out there.

274
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:48,122
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're basically trying to make laws pass now to prevent people from pirating their games.

275
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:50,504
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.

276
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:51,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

277
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:52,906
[SPEAKER_09]: That's hilarious.

278
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:54,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you think that'll just make it worse, or what?

279
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:57,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yes.

280
00:17:57,749 --> 00:18:00,852
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually, because of the news, I went ahead and bought another one.

281
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:01,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Just...

282
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:03,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Just in case.

283
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:10,484
[SPEAKER_13]: No, just, you know, because my wife wanted one for, you know, she plays puzzle games and I don't see, you know,

284
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:19,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me read this real fast before we talk a little more about this because this is right in the same line with us talking about how you guys are running off and buying one and all this.

285
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:28,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the word is that the R4 pricing and the sales of them are increasing a lot after this whole lawsuit happened.

286
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:37,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, in two days' time, the price of an R4 at some stores in Japan went from just under 3,000 yen to just under 5,000 yen.

287
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:39,183
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking from $28 to $55 literally overnight.

288
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:45,446
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is, is maybe that what Nintendo was trying to go for?

289
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Driving the price of these up due to the fear?

290
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:49,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

291
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:52,148
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems a little counterproductive to me because it makes the demand of them go up in a way.

292
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:56,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that's really going to affect anything because people are just buying them really fast now.

293
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,410
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just figuring, hey, we can cash in on it now.

294
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,252
[SPEAKER_13]: But when the demand goes back down, they're just going to clear out their inventory somewhere and they'll still be sold somewhere.

295
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:06,833
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

296
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I mean, at least they're taking notice of this, I guess.

297
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:17,436
[SPEAKER_04]: In a way, though, devil's advocate, Loki, these devices can promote piracy.

298
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,619
[SPEAKER_13]: So why should they be allowed on the market?

299
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, because guns can kill people, so, you know...

300
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:29,977
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not the gun killing the people, it's the people killing the people with the guns.

301
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:37,866
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like, these devices, sure, they can allow you to pirate games, but it's the people pirating the games that are actually pirating the games.

302
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:40,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room, I'm very, very curious to hear what you guys have to say in our chat room.

303
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLauncher.com I want to read some of your comments.

304
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:43,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Is...

305
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:45,534
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of this?

306
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:48,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these devices okay?

307
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:50,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you against these devices?

308
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:54,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember we had a listener a while ago that was very, very anti-piracy that would usually chime in on these issues.

309
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:55,623
[SPEAKER_04]: He hasn't been around in a while.

310
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:58,065
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe you pissed him off finally, Loki.

311
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

312
00:19:59,446 --> 00:19:59,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious.

313
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:01,887
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be folks on both ends of the spectrum.

314
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:05,349
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys in chat think about this whole deal?

315
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:08,350
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you say you're interested in buying one.

316
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to ask the same question to you.

317
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:14,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Devil's Advocate, these devices, you could say they do promote piracy.

318
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:16,193
[SPEAKER_04]: They do allow you to play copied games on your system.

319
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:17,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should they be allowed?

320
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:22,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, honestly, I don't think that they necessarily should be allowed.

321
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:24,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

322
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:25,551
[SPEAKER_09]: www.DarkSakura.com

323
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:55,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is what my thought would be, is that Nintendo talk to the developers and make multi-packs of old games so that...

324
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:00,092
[SPEAKER_09]: X number of games on a cartridge for $30.

325
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:03,074
[SPEAKER_09]: They could market something like that.

326
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:06,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Or even have their own download service for old games like that.

327
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:08,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Virtual Console?

328
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about for the DS.

329
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:19,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Perhaps they're looking at the Virtual Console and perhaps expanding it to the DS and going to put out a device similar to that to do such a thing anyways.

330
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:23,023
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're worried people are going to pirate the Virtual Console games which are $5-$10 a pop.

331
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:25,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

332
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:45,499
[SPEAKER_13]: or the fact that they're worried that sales are going to dip a lot like the PSP because they blame piracy on that.

333
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,302
[SPEAKER_13]: I blame bad games, but you know.

334
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:53,688
[SPEAKER_04]: But piracy kind of being able to play old Nintendo games on the PSP kind of drove sales in the beginning.

335
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:56,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, I want to let you finish your thought before I go to chat comments.

336
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:57,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

337
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:57,632
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

338
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:05,336
[SPEAKER_09]: My whole point is that I honestly do think that Nintendo might be looking to market something like that.

339
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:08,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't really matter because piracy is illegal.

340
00:22:08,598 --> 00:22:09,699
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the end of the story.

341
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:19,284
[SPEAKER_09]: If you use something that is non-proprietary that is not sponsored by Nintendo to play copies of their games, it is technically theft.

342
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:45,482
[SPEAKER_09]: so I don't think they're ever going to be okay but I think Nintendo might be looking for a way to sort of market the idea for their own benefit so I can see why they would want to push it although honestly Nintendo has had the easiest way to pirate or play imports or anything on their systems because in the past it was just a physical lockout you adjust a tab and boom you can play your imports on your Super Nintendo you know

343
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,442
[SPEAKER_09]: There were absolutely no lockouts on the old Game Boys.

344
00:22:50,343 --> 00:22:54,905
[SPEAKER_09]: You can still play imports on the DS and you can buy those multi-game cartridges for dirt cheap.

345
00:22:55,665 --> 00:23:04,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So really, the whole problem I think is that Nintendo needs to look at how they're actually allowing it, is how I see it.

346
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:12,334
[SPEAKER_09]: They've had to have built in so much because they have not been the best at preventing the piracy from going on.

347
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:17,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look at some comments from chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because it's your show too here at Orange Lounge Radio.

348
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:19,324
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd like to hear what you guys have to say.

349
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Blake says, it's the law of software.

350
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Stopping piracy is impossible no matter how hard you try.

351
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:29,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, disclaimer, use it for homebrew only as in programs and stuff.

352
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:30,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't pirate, please.

353
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:32,806
[SPEAKER_04]: To which I think this is kind of a good follow-up comment.

354
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:39,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Joshi16 says, it would be like banning smoking pipes because you can put illegal drugs in it, but you can also put tobacco in them.

355
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like how you choose to use it.

356
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:42,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

357
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,012
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, I agree with Loki though.

358
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:48,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably wouldn't risk my DS by using one of those.

359
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:49,497
[SPEAKER_04]: If it breaks, I'm screwed.

360
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:51,759
[SPEAKER_04]: MissingNo says, I heart the R4.

361
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:57,206
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's the thing though, is it won't hurt your DS at all because it's a device that runs on a cart.

362
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,728
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not flashing your DS.

363
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:00,170
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not doing anything to your DS.

364
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Alpha Cananogram says, this is bullshit, but if they do take down these devices, they need to leave the homebrew-only flash carts alone.

365
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:10,875
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a homebrew up to listen to internet radio on your DS.

366
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:14,916
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru says, well, if Nintendo makes their own R4, that would be cool.

367
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:16,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love this name, too.

368
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:21,939
[SPEAKER_04]: The original snake, Lieutenant Plissken, says, absolutely okay.

369
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:25,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, it makes it possible, but there are lots of homebrew and other features.

370
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:27,802
[SPEAKER_04]: People will always find a way to pirate.

371
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:30,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this comment was interesting though.

372
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:34,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitstun says, I guess I still don't understand how piracy is theft.

373
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:43,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if you're being facetious, but do keep in mind, you know, people get paid to make games just like people get paid to make movies and paid to write music and what have you.

374
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:48,535
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you take it without paying for it, that's less money.

375
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, granted, you get into this whole...

376
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:52,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

377
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:20,608
[SPEAKER_09]: PS3 films on BitTorrent while you're waiting for the European PSN network.

378
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:48,650
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, he's actually saying that we, and this is a quote, we are a PAL market and we are going to do it in PAL and we are going to do it properly.

379
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:57,616
[SPEAKER_09]: So he said that if you want the good quality, then you can, you know, I guess just wait for it or download it like everyone else does.

380
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:01,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

381
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not often you hear people acknowledging.

382
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:04,698
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an idiot.

383
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:11,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I have something I want to say about Sony, which is completely off-base, so before I go on tangent, does anyone want to comment on the actual story?

384
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:12,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

385
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:19,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Casino Royale for the first time last night, which, by the way, I forgot how sexy Bond movies are.

386
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:22,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't James Bond just a sexy fucking franchise of movies?

387
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I watched the last movie.

388
00:26:24,692 --> 00:26:27,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But just in general, all the way back to the Sean Connery days.

389
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:29,095
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

390
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:29,756
[SPEAKER_04]: If you say so.

391
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:30,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

392
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:31,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're hot.

393
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:33,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I like certain movies.

394
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:33,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put it that way.

395
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,340
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how it's relevant.

396
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,642
[SPEAKER_04]: They whored Sony in that movie.

397
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:40,904
[SPEAKER_04]: James Bond uses a VAIO.

398
00:26:41,204 --> 00:26:43,306
[SPEAKER_04]: The cell phones were from Sony.

399
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:46,908
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie studio to put that out, I'm sure, was Sony Pictures.

400
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:50,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I just lulled at the fact how much Sony was whored in that movie.

401
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:51,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just kind of fun.

402
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:52,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed.

403
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually, I don't notice those things.

404
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:58,197
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we made a movie, we would be putting orange on stuff all over it?

405
00:26:58,477 --> 00:26:59,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's different.

406
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:01,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to buy dinner.

407
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:03,905
[SPEAKER_13]: These people have a lot of money.

408
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:07,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they're trying to buy a lot of dinner at the same time.

409
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:07,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, forget it.

410
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Move on.

411
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:19,168
[SPEAKER_13]: So, in case you had some hope out there that Final Fantasy XIII Versus was possibly coming to the Xbox 360, Square says no, it's not.

412
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:27,710
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, according to their video that they played during their latest fan event, I don't even know how you would pronounce this...

413
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:32,296
[SPEAKER_13]: DKS3713 party.

414
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:39,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, they had the video for Final Fantasy Versus which said PlayStation 3 only worldwide.

415
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:43,344
[SPEAKER_13]: And in small print, fuck you Xbox 360 fanboys.

416
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:44,325
[SPEAKER_13]: No, just kidding.

417
00:27:44,725 --> 00:27:46,806
[SPEAKER_13]: It was not coming out on the 360.

418
00:27:47,647 --> 00:27:56,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, I'd be interested to see if that's actually going to be the case when the 360 version of Final Fantasy 13 comes out and kicks ass sales-wise.

419
00:27:57,975 --> 00:27:58,135
[SPEAKER_13]: But...

420
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:00,296
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

421
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:22,049
[SPEAKER_13]: 4 different Final Fantasy 13 games at the same time.

422
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,731
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because they've released 7 different Final Fantasy 7 games.

423
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:28,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, over the course of 5 years or something.

424
00:28:28,114 --> 00:28:31,337
[SPEAKER_13]: But now it's just like, hey, those all sold really well.

425
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:34,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's make a lot of games all portioned apart.

426
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,841
[SPEAKER_13]: And you won't be buying them?

427
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:38,724
[SPEAKER_13]: I won't be buying every single... No, 2 of the 3.

428
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:43,829
[SPEAKER_13]: One of which happens to be on... Well, one of them...

429
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,461
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

430
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Only the PlayStation 3 version and only in Japan because they're not going cross-platform over in Japan.

431
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:27,146
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it will be out in 2009 and then they're going to start the localization and the port for the Xbox 360, which probably means we'll see it in 2010 because when they say they're going to get it in 2009, that probably means Christmas of 2009.

432
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:28,107
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

433
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be pleasantly surprised.

434
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:30,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

435
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:35,149
[SPEAKER_04]: All I know, I can't wait to see what the game actually looks like.

436
00:29:38,137 --> 00:29:40,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Pingu Waku Waku Carnival

437
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:07,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really know much about these games except one of them is Snoopy and the other one has a funny name.

438
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:12,249
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's no release date for them in anywhere but Japan and it just says Autumn.

439
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, it should be called Fozzy Waka Waka Carnival.

440
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:17,351
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Waku.

441
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:18,332
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

442
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:19,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

443
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:20,933
[SPEAKER_13]: He was making a bad joke.

444
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,013
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a really bad joke.

445
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:24,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to throw a tomato at Loki.

446
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:28,745
[SPEAKER_13]: At least it's a lot better than, I don't know, a Snoopy game.

447
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:31,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Peanuts are still very popular overseas.

448
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:34,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Peanuts are still very popular in my house.

449
00:30:35,446 --> 00:30:36,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I love peanuts.

450
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,507
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what will never stop being awesome?

451
00:30:39,227 --> 00:30:39,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever?

452
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Snoopy snow cone machines.

453
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:43,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the greatest thing ever.

454
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:43,668
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

455
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:44,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I rest my case.

456
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, remember when we lived together and I bought one?

457
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:50,087
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

458
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:09,504
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

459
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:42,300
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkTetsuya says, good grief, Rob.

460
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, something that's not Snoopy related, but a lot cooler.

461
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:50,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Japanese Advent Children fans are going to be happy that

462
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:59,909
[SPEAKER_13]: A brand new Director's Cut will be coming to Blu-ray soon, and with it will be coming the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

463
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,253
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, will also be coming a new PS3 bundle.

464
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:10,960
[SPEAKER_13]: All this is supposed to happen March 2009, and I don't know, I'm excited.

465
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:13,343
[SPEAKER_13]: May have to import it.

466
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:21,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it just me or is it one of those things where I should have known the whole time this is why Final Fantasy VII Advent Children was kind of short.

467
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:25,227
[SPEAKER_04]: This was just coming the whole time.

468
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Bonus, 20 minutes deleted footage or whatever.

469
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucker.

470
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I should just tattoo it on my forehead.

471
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:33,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I should everyone else who bought it.

472
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:36,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also like to remind listeners of this show not to text me while I'm doing the show.

473
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:37,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

474
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:39,835
[SPEAKER_13]: I get that too.

475
00:32:41,136 --> 00:32:44,498
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't get that because I turn my phone off.

476
00:32:44,938 --> 00:32:45,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good for you.

477
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, the PSP game which Loki earlier referred to is that kind of missing Final Fantasy XIII game.

478
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,285
[SPEAKER_04]: You've heard a lot about Final Fantasy XIII and Versus XIII.

479
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:59,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's also Gaito XIII is coming out as well.

480
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:00,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Agito.

481
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:01,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Agito

482
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:30,454
[SPEAKER_04]: More multi-platformism in the Square Enix world and this game soon to be on the PSP.

483
00:33:30,514 --> 00:33:34,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not soon, but eventually, one day, far in the future, to be on the PSP.

484
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:41,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking of which, I don't know if anyone remembers that the latest Parasite Eve game was supposed to be exclusive on mobile phones.

485
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:46,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Squeenix actually said that it will be out on PSP.

486
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:52,894
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't say anything about there being a mobile phone version in development, but it's called The Third Birthday.

487
00:33:53,695 --> 00:34:01,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had some sort of trailer of it up that has the main character, Aya, in a wedding dress.

488
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:02,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

489
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:04,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

490
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:05,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, with a gun.

491
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:07,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you have to have a gun.

492
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:08,476
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to have a gun.

493
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:13,317
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a franchise people have been waiting for for a long, long time.

494
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:14,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's been eight years since the last one.

495
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:15,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time.

496
00:34:16,518 --> 00:34:17,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Will she be in her birthday suit?

497
00:34:18,178 --> 00:34:19,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish they'd translate the novel.

498
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:21,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

499
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,459
[SPEAKER_04]: There was like a novel.

500
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:25,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there something else that was like a cell phone game or something?

501
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,780
[SPEAKER_13]: There was also a live action movie.

502
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,340
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a movie.

503
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got the movie somewhere, but I haven't watched it yet.

504
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,981
[SPEAKER_09]: But my friends read the novel a couple of times and says it's pretty good.

505
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:32,841
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw the movie.

506
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:33,401
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty cool.

507
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:35,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember much of it, though.

508
00:34:35,522 --> 00:34:38,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember your mitochondria are full of evil.

509
00:34:39,364 --> 00:34:42,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Son of Dad in chat says Parasite Eve 2 is kind of a letdown.

510
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:44,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I didn't play it.

511
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:47,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's move on.

512
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:48,688
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

513
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:53,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we're still waiting for Home.

514
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Still.

515
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:56,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Xevious

516
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:27,160
[SPEAKER_13]: and there'll be three secret titles that are still on the way.

517
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:29,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Mappy for the win.

518
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:31,383
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

519
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:38,228
[SPEAKER_13]: One good thing about this, though, and I assume you don't have to pay to play these games, is that you don't have to pay to play these games.

520
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:39,769
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a hell of an assumption, by the way.

521
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:40,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

522
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't it be interesting if you... Because a lot of people thought this should be Xbox Live's price model.

523
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:49,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't it be interesting if you have to insert a quarter, quote-unquote, to play the games?

524
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:51,037
[SPEAKER_13]: I will not be playing those games.

525
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:51,937
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the case.

526
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:52,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Because...

527
00:35:53,464 --> 00:36:04,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I have them on 360 DarkSakura, I'm kind of curious what you think about the Namco games being at home because I know you're an avid collector of the museum games so it kind of feels like we've had to buy them before and now they're going to be free maybe?

528
00:36:05,503 --> 00:36:07,346
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're free I'll get them, if not I don't care

529
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:09,318
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

530
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:27,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says free is good except for Yaris.

531
00:36:27,214 --> 00:36:34,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say those primetime games are probably going to be free and they're going to probably finance them with advertisements.

532
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,392
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

533
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:11,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI

534
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:32,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't find it to be that hard either.

535
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:33,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember, Loki?

536
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:34,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking easy.

537
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:36,297
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just like stupid easy.

538
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:37,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

539
00:37:37,378 --> 00:37:47,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, someone does not agree, and the name is Alex Edwards, and he is actually kind of... It's not so much a lawsuit, but what has happened is one thing has led to another.

540
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:56,950
[SPEAKER_04]: There is now a new Illinois law that mandates that MMO providers have to make an online cancellation option available, that you have to be able to do it online.

541
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It is online!

542
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,091
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was thinking, but here's the deal, here's how the story goes.

543
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:09,313
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy was playing Final Fantasy XI, he grew tired of the game, his parents were paying $13 a month, and they tried to cancel the account online.

544
00:38:09,753 --> 00:38:25,256
[SPEAKER_04]: But the claim is that Final Fantasy didn't offer them a way to do it online, didn't offer a contact phone number, so finally they went to the credit card statement to get the phone number, spent an hour and 45 minutes on hold, finally someone answered the phone, and they got it cancelled.

545
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:25,837
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

546
00:38:38,511 --> 00:39:07,305
[SPEAKER_04]: and then was like you know how awful play online is to uninstall and then it was like oh crap I can't delete it from the website I was supposed to do that on play online well duh that's what the instructions say and you have a manual hi well maybe in that regard does it have some merit then that you actually have to still have the game installed to be able to cancel it I mean to be honest you don't for Warcraft you can do that all on the website it's super easy I mean if you can't figure out how to cancel wow you're dumb I mean it's really really easy to cancel wow

547
00:39:08,966 --> 00:39:16,692
[SPEAKER_13]: He just pissed off that there's no big, giant button that encompasses the entire screen that says, TO CANCEL, CLICK HERE!

548
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,275
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, seriously, it was not that hard to figure out how to cancel.

549
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:22,837
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't hidden in menus, it was so easy.

550
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:28,442
[SPEAKER_09]: It was right on the Play Online screen, if you wanted to cancel it.

551
00:39:28,522 --> 00:39:35,148
[SPEAKER_13]: And obviously they had to have signed up for an account, and it's done the exact same way as you cancel it, so...

552
00:39:36,189 --> 00:39:37,030
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

553
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:54,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I wanted to read the summary of the actual law.

554
00:39:54,726 --> 00:40:14,315
[SPEAKER_04]: An internet gaming service provider that provides service to a consumer for a stated term that is automatically renewed for another term unless a consumer cancels the service must give a consumer who is an Illinois resident a secure method at the internet gaming service provider's website that the consumer may use to cancel the service, which method shall not require the consumer to make a telephone call or send U.S.

555
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:17,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Postal Service mail to effectuate the cancellation, and to...

556
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:44,310
[SPEAKER_04]: instructions that the consumer may follow to cancel the service at the internet gaming service provider's website makes it an unlawful business practice for an internet gaming service provider to violate the new provisions now is it just me though or was it a heck of a lot easier to cancel Final Fantasy XI than it was to cancel America Online maybe I'm crazy but at least they weren't begging me to stay actually if you call them and do it they try to get you to stay by giving you free months

557
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:46,398
[SPEAKER_04]: On Final Fantasy XI even?

558
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:46,738
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

559
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:47,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

560
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:49,780
[SPEAKER_04]: America Online tries to pull it all out.

561
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, my account was already free.

562
00:40:53,822 --> 00:40:54,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Retention.

563
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:56,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so there you have it.

564
00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:56,664
[SPEAKER_04]: New laws.

565
00:40:58,285 --> 00:40:59,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Ridiculous.

566
00:41:00,006 --> 00:41:00,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

567
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:00,986
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so stupid.

568
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,227
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, how about some release dates?

569
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:07,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Like three items coming out on the 8th in Europe?

570
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:19,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Beijing 2008, The Official Video Game of the Olympic Games, Race Driver Grid, and The Mummy Tomb of the Emperor on PlayStation 2.

571
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:30,709
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

572
00:41:57,844 --> 00:41:58,204
[SPEAKER_13]: B-Boy PS2, PSP

573
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:10,258
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

574
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:33,734
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

575
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that is the one that comes with the Xbox 360, if I'm not mistaken.

576
00:42:52,411 --> 00:42:54,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was a bundle pack coming out in Japan.

577
00:42:54,553 --> 00:42:55,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't quote me on that.

578
00:42:56,175 --> 00:42:59,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a PlayStation 3 version of NBA 2K8 is being released this week.

579
00:43:00,158 --> 00:43:01,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to the Nintendo Wii.

580
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Survival Kids Wii.

581
00:43:04,522 --> 00:43:06,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if that's Lost in Blue.

582
00:43:06,444 --> 00:43:07,304
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Lost in Blue.

583
00:43:07,405 --> 00:43:08,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it is.

584
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:09,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Survival Kids.

585
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's Lost in Blue on the Wii.

586
00:43:11,368 --> 00:43:12,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's coming out.

587
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:18,580
[SPEAKER_04]: and Imabikiyosu Kamihen comes out as well on the Wii this week from Sega.

588
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:24,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And this game looks to be... What the heck?

589
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:25,013
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it might be a...

590
00:43:25,714 --> 00:43:26,114
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

591
00:43:48,848 --> 00:43:54,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the brains at the OL Army headquarters need to get to work on a horror dating sim.

592
00:43:55,178 --> 00:43:56,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whore, but a horror.

593
00:43:58,197 --> 00:44:02,819
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 2, God of War 2 gets a price reduction this week in Japan, moving into the Best Price series.

594
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:09,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Grim Grimoire and Sengoku Barasa 2 Heroes also move into that same series.

595
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:11,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Some new games coming out this week.

596
00:44:11,622 --> 00:44:24,126
[SPEAKER_04]: True Tears is coming out, as well as Aoi Koro no Kusabi Hiro no Kakera 3 comes out in Japan this week, which is looks like some type of role-playing-ish game.

597
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:26,187
[SPEAKER_04]: You play a dude...

598
00:44:27,048 --> 00:44:29,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, it kind of looks like a dating sim.

599
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:32,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would he have a sword if it's a dating sim?

600
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:37,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Because all cool kids have swords who date.

601
00:44:38,032 --> 00:44:41,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if it goes bad, you know, they can commit suicide.

602
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:42,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Just stop.

603
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:43,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Just stop.

604
00:44:44,073 --> 00:44:51,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I just wanted to mention real quick that in a couple weeks, actually, we're going to be getting Line Rider 2, which is exciting for the DS and the Wii.

605
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:54,773
[SPEAKER_04]: on the Nintendo DS.

606
00:44:54,873 --> 00:44:59,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster Farm 2 DS in Japan this week, as well as Fire Emblem.

607
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:12,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Shin Ankoku Ryoutu Nihikari no Ken comes out this week, as well as Chou Shoutou Kadoukis 2, which is a game from Atlus, comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.

608
00:45:13,345 --> 00:45:14,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's Trauma Center 2.

609
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:16,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

610
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You finally get that in Japan this week.

611
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:33,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the Sony PSP, just some price reductions on Quiz Mobile Suit Gundam Tonsenshi, as well as Dai Senryaku Portable 2 and Doku Makimuri Kai.

612
00:45:33,758 --> 00:45:34,898
[SPEAKER_04]: They all get price reductions this week.

613
00:45:35,138 --> 00:45:41,022
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as new games go, Crazy Taxi Double Punch comes out on the PSP this week in Japan.

614
00:45:41,222 --> 00:45:41,802
[SPEAKER_09]: That's happy.

615
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:43,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready to make some crazy money.

616
00:45:43,904 --> 00:45:45,344
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for your Japanese release dates.

617
00:45:45,364 --> 00:45:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to some gaming news.

618
00:45:47,472 --> 00:45:56,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in other gaming news, and this actually isn't necessarily just Just Just Game, but this is for our cosplay people as well.

619
00:45:57,938 --> 00:46:10,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Gamefly is having an open casting for the next commercial, so they actually want cosplayers to send them videos saying why they love Gamefly and why the character that they're dressed up at is their favorite.

620
00:46:11,806 --> 00:46:11,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

621
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:19,285
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I think it's going to be kind of iffy, but here's the details if anyone wants it.

622
00:46:19,766 --> 00:46:24,231
[SPEAKER_09]: There are live casting calls that are going to be in LA, New York, and Chicago.

623
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:32,860
[SPEAKER_09]: That's in September, and you actually send a 45 second entry after August 26th.

624
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:40,964
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as more information on this, the live casting calls are September 9th, Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Highland Center.

00:46:41,444 --> 00:46:42,825

[SPEAKER_09]: EST.

630
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,465
[SPEAKER_04]: All those cosplayers are going to fit right in at Hollywood and Highland.

631
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:11,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually told Ranma, the minute I read about this, I went to Twitter and I posted, Ranma!

632
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:13,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Luigi needs to be in this commercial.

633
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:14,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it happen.

634
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So he said he's going to go.

635
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:17,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope if he... Cover it for us.

636
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:18,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, cover it for us.

637
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:23,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know if it is any good or if it seems like a scam or whatever.

638
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:25,065
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it'll be good.

639
00:47:25,925 --> 00:47:28,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I want lots of photos from this event.

640
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:34,749
[SPEAKER_09]: You know people are going to go just for the photo ops because that's like half the big thing about cosplay is your photo ops too.

641
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:37,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Any excuse to be on TV, people are going to go nuts.

642
00:47:38,451 --> 00:47:40,832
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know people are going to see these commercials too and go, what?

643
00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:43,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

644
00:47:43,975 --> 00:47:45,056
[SPEAKER_04]: But there'll be other people that gets it.

645
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:46,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, cosplay opportunity, go for it.

646
00:47:46,757 --> 00:47:47,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

647
00:47:47,817 --> 00:47:52,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, cosplayers can get like actual real recognition in the real world.

648
00:47:52,681 --> 00:47:53,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good thing.

649
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:55,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

650
00:47:56,203 --> 00:47:59,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki is going to be giving us a massive homebrew update tonight.

651
00:47:59,505 --> 00:47:59,886
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this?

652
00:47:59,906 --> 00:48:02,067
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like massive amounts of news in the homebrew world.

653
00:48:02,187 --> 00:48:03,788
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a bunch of little small things.

654
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:04,909
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just thought I'd mention it.

655
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:06,031
[SPEAKER_13]: WeBrew.com

656
00:48:21,253 --> 00:48:45,696
[SPEAKER_13]: and what it does is it allows you to kind of toggle different things you want to be installed in one giant zip file and you download it and you drag and drop it to your SD memory card and if you have Twilight Princess you can use the Twilight hack to install the homebrew channel and a bunch of different homebrew programs on there and they've got a huge list of stuff and they keep adding more to it so definitely the way to go if you haven't

657
00:48:46,897 --> 00:48:50,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Don Homebrew Stuff Yet, or if you just want to make it easy to find all your programs in one spot.

658
00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:56,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, I think we'll get some use out of this, but they have the Any Title Deleter.

659
00:48:57,086 --> 00:48:59,608
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a space-freeing program for the Wii.

660
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:06,694
[SPEAKER_13]: It allows you to remove previously unremovable tiles, including the weather and news channel.

661
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:11,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, though, if you have any games that have updates, they will reinstall them for you, but...

662
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:13,421
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

663
00:49:39,093 --> 00:49:49,984
[SPEAKER_13]: and of course everything will be in Japanese there is some risk involved with it though you have to read the instructions very carefully because you can actually brick your console with this if it's not done right so don't do it

664
00:49:52,008 --> 00:49:52,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Just don't.

665
00:49:52,548 --> 00:49:52,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't.

666
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:39,009
[SPEAKER_13]: and you can import custom songs and all sorts of things well the new version 2.9 has come out it's still in beta but it now has online support and so they have instructions on how you can set up your PC or router I guess to be able to play online with other people so that's kind of neat though you can do online in it I don't know if you can actually do online on the Wii with Guitar Hero 3 I think you might be able to but either way it's still cool um

667
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:40,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

668
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:00,579
[SPEAKER_13]: and that's it

669
00:51:30,404 --> 00:51:31,304
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

670
00:51:52,534 --> 00:52:12,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Like a 3D space shooter, it's actually now becoming a full game on the PlayStation Network That's going to be downloadable via them, you actually have to pay for it now But you'll be able to download it to your PSP and play it But it's the first time that a homebrew game like this has become downloadable on the PlayStation platform So that's kind of neat

671
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:15,125
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully they'll be coming soon.

672
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:16,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

673
00:52:17,146 --> 00:52:19,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wanted to read this comment from chat.

674
00:52:19,727 --> 00:52:22,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the cosplay Gamefly commercial thing.

675
00:52:23,048 --> 00:52:24,848
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt, I believe, was the one that said this.

676
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:26,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Manfei.

677
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:28,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Could Manfei make an appearance?

678
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Manfei would either be scary or fantastic.

679
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,492
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of both extremes, don't you think?

680
00:52:35,632 --> 00:52:41,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the male Utena cosplayer to show up who looked perfectly female.

681
00:52:42,717 --> 00:52:46,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I lived in New York with Ranma because I'd go and dress as Black Mage.

682
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:48,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we could both be in it.

683
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:49,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what...

684
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:53,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Mage has in common with Luigi, but you never know.

685
00:52:55,072 --> 00:53:01,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very excited about this upcoming game, and DarkSakura, I don't know about you, but maybe you'll play this with me.

686
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:06,774
[SPEAKER_04]: SingStar Musicals is a new rumored game to be coming out.

687
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:16,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposedly, it's going to be coming out in 2009, and some songs that are rumored to be in it, Bad Guys from Bugsy Malone, Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King,

688
00:53:17,296 --> 00:53:21,379
[SPEAKER_04]: If I Were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof and Over the Rainbow from Wizard of Oz.

689
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,422
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I need this song to be in it.

690
00:53:26,443 --> 00:53:27,284
[SPEAKER_04]: If at all possible.

691
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:34,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, not Springtime for Hitler?

692
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:39,554
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you should find the one from the movie.

693
00:53:39,694 --> 00:53:39,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

694
00:53:44,885 --> 00:53:47,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that one from the movie?

695
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:48,069
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

696
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:52,133
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from... Well, no, it's just because John Barrowman sang the one in the movie.

697
00:53:52,153 --> 00:53:54,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they have the one from the movie on iTunes.

698
00:53:54,095 --> 00:53:57,319
[SPEAKER_09]: The recent movie, because... Well, I think he's wonderful.

699
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:01,093
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, this is a rumored game that's going to be coming out.

700
00:54:01,453 --> 00:54:03,574
[SPEAKER_04]: That being said, I actually think this rumor is bull.

701
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this rumor is a load of crap.

702
00:54:05,874 --> 00:54:06,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe that it's true.

703
00:54:08,295 --> 00:54:13,816
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the big reasons I don't think it's true is that this rumored song list has Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King.

704
00:54:14,737 --> 00:54:19,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney owns that, and if Disney was going to put that in a game, Disney would be making a Disney game.

705
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:22,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney, I don't think, would be likely to loan this out.

706
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:26,920
[SPEAKER_04]: One of their biggest songs, I mean, granted, I don't know, I guess Elton John wrote it, so maybe there's a way around it.

707
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really a musical either.

708
00:54:28,742 --> 00:54:30,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, yes, they did a Lion King musical.

709
00:54:30,723 --> 00:54:33,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they did, but it's Disney's musical.

710
00:54:33,606 --> 00:54:34,367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Sony's.

711
00:54:34,507 --> 00:54:35,047
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

712
00:54:35,107 --> 00:54:37,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think Sony would be able to license that from Disney.

713
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:37,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?

714
00:54:39,111 --> 00:54:41,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's necessarily Disney that owns Soul Rites.

715
00:54:41,953 --> 00:54:46,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I mean, would there really be that many people that are going to buy this?

716
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:47,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I would.

717
00:54:48,499 --> 00:54:50,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I would too, but we're kind of weird.

718
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:51,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So?

719
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:54,849
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

720
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I still want to import it.

721
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,509
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be fun.

722
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:26,294
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also been a big surge in West End Theater now, especially with those shows that they're doing now.

723
00:55:26,394 --> 00:55:32,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Sort of like a pop idol for musicals.

724
00:55:32,918 --> 00:55:35,240
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you solve a problem like Maria?

725
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that was a John Barrowman show.

726
00:55:37,922 --> 00:55:38,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it was.

727
00:55:38,382 --> 00:55:39,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking you're a fangirl.

728
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:40,503
[SPEAKER_09]: You are ruining my song!

729
00:55:40,523 --> 00:55:42,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, me sorry, me no mean to!

730
00:55:42,204 --> 00:55:46,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you wouldn't mind, please, being quiet for a minute so I can finish?

731
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:09,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we have this new technology.

732
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:10,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor porn.

733
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Which gives us untold opportunities.

734
00:56:14,773 --> 00:56:15,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor porn.

735
00:56:15,574 --> 00:56:17,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

736
00:56:17,435 --> 00:56:18,496
[SPEAKER_04]: God, it'll never get old.

737
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:20,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Avenue Q is playing in town, Rob.

738
00:56:20,657 --> 00:56:21,177
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to go see it.

739
00:56:21,197 --> 00:56:21,718
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to go.

740
00:56:21,738 --> 00:56:22,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

741
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:22,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

742
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:26,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor porn.

743
00:56:28,543 --> 00:56:32,666
[SPEAKER_09]: We've said that as the previous cage match winner, if I do recall correctly.

744
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:34,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was a cage match winner at one point.

745
00:56:35,575 --> 00:56:35,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it!

746
00:56:37,176 --> 00:56:38,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And a very good question from chat.

747
00:56:39,198 --> 00:56:40,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very good informed question.

748
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,002
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what about SingStar Rocky Horror Edition?

749
00:56:44,622 --> 00:56:45,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

750
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:47,725
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be hot.

751
00:56:47,765 --> 00:56:48,565
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you do I?

752
00:56:48,926 --> 00:56:52,308
[SPEAKER_04]: See you've met my faithful handyman.

753
00:56:52,669 --> 00:56:55,371
[SPEAKER_09]: An audience participation sub-track.

754
00:56:55,471 --> 00:57:01,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how much money I would pay for Loki to sing Sweet Transvestite live on air?

755
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:07,090
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura will dig through the archive and tell you kids what you should be playing

756
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:37,074
[SPEAKER_04]: What should the children be paying a little respect to this week?

757
00:57:37,415 --> 00:57:40,016
[SPEAKER_09]: The game of the week is Jumping Flash.

758
00:57:41,217 --> 00:57:41,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

759
00:57:41,797 --> 00:57:42,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Jumping Flash.

760
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,521
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've mentioned this show on air many, many, many times.

761
00:57:49,002 --> 00:57:58,868
[SPEAKER_09]: When I first moved into my college dorm room, I was put in charge of my friend's boyfriend's PlayStation.

762
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:01,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Jumping Flash, Barren Aloha, Robot,

763
00:58:21,406 --> 00:58:30,071
[SPEAKER_09]: has to use these jetpods to, you know, I guess break these jetpods and get the little islands back to Earth.

764
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:30,991
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

765
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:36,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just say to Son of Dad in chat, this is not Jumpin' Jack Flash with Whoopi Goldberg.

766
00:58:36,374 --> 00:58:37,014
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

767
00:58:37,355 --> 00:58:37,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it!

768
00:58:39,409 --> 00:58:50,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, the way that the game plays is it is very first person, and I will tell you that this totally, totally made me motion sick as hell, but it's great.

769
00:58:50,673 --> 00:59:01,077
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, the article makes a note that it's actually just like a game called Geograph Seal, which is for the Sharp X68000, so I'll have to look for that later on.

770
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:15,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, you play as Robert looking through Robert's eyes and you've got a screen showing you how much time you have remaining in your score and the sidekick called Kumagoro, which gives you hints and warnings and helps you out.

771
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:25,763
[SPEAKER_09]: You've also got fireworks items as your firing mechanism, power-ups, jetpods, all this other neat stuff that goes with it.

772
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:27,964
[SPEAKER_09]: So the big thing about those, you have to jump.

773
00:59:28,604 --> 00:59:30,589
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can make him jump three times.

774
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:33,918
[SPEAKER_09]: You can jump off the ground twice in mid-air.

775
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:36,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can get really high over the ground.

776
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:45,657
[SPEAKER_09]: and instead of being faced horizontally, when you jump, the camera tilts down towards the ground.

777
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:51,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you see why I'm talking about getting motion sick there too?

778
00:59:51,962 --> 00:59:56,907
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can also use your enemies to bounce off of in some cases.

779
00:59:56,967 --> 01:00:02,131
[SPEAKER_09]: But you get different fireworks for attacks, like cherry bombs, rockets, roman candles, and twisters.

780
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:05,093
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get time extensions.

781
01:00:05,754 --> 01:00:09,236
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get different jetpods that are EXIT.

782
01:00:09,596 --> 01:00:13,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when you get them, you go to the exit pad and you can leave the level.

783
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,040
[SPEAKER_09]: You also have hidden levels.

784
01:00:16,601 --> 01:00:18,482
[SPEAKER_09]: The rollercoaster level was fun, I have to say.

785
01:00:20,377 --> 01:00:27,079
[SPEAKER_09]: and you have a time attack mode so you can try to get out of the levels in a certain amount of time.

786
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:33,881
[SPEAKER_09]: There also was a sequel that was called Jumping Flash 2 that did not do as well.

787
01:00:34,621 --> 01:00:35,861
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was still a fun game.

788
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:42,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently there were pseudo-sequels that were only released in Japan.

789
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:47,445
[SPEAKER_09]: There was Robert Mundu on PlayStation and Pocket Mumu that was on Pocket Station.

790
01:00:47,465 --> 01:00:48,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

791
01:00:48,405 --> 01:00:48,585
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

792
01:00:48,965 --> 01:00:50,605
[SPEAKER_04]: PocketMuMu PocketMuMu

793
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:20,307
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, it's actually, you can, you can get Jumping Flash at the PlayStation Store.

794
01:01:21,588 --> 01:01:26,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, coming soon, uh, the next sequel, Captain Uma Uma Nuka Nuka Apawaha.

795
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:28,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

796
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:29,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad joke.

797
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:32,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on, Ferret.

798
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:34,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I never actually played, uh, Jumping Flash.

799
01:01:34,932 --> 01:01:35,332
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't!

800
01:01:35,432 --> 01:01:36,192
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I never did.

801
01:01:36,412 --> 01:01:39,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Jumping Flash in the massive old PlayStation cases.

802
01:01:40,444 --> 01:01:41,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in college.

803
01:01:41,725 --> 01:01:43,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Fighter came out years after.

804
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:06,541
[SPEAKER_09]: At any rate, if you want to play this game, then I will see about locating my copy of it and bringing it over or something.

805
01:02:07,363 --> 01:02:08,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

806
01:02:08,985 --> 01:02:13,972
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cheeseball and it's early PlayStation, but it's a fun little game.

807
01:02:15,635 --> 01:02:19,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

808
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, Jump and Flash, your classic game of the week.

809
01:02:22,341 --> 01:02:28,607
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break, but we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after some music for the live listeners.

810
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:32,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, if things get sent to me in time here, we'll do some music.

811
01:02:33,131 --> 01:02:35,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, we're going to have some music on the podcast as well tonight.

812
01:02:36,233 --> 01:02:37,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you a little bit more about that in just a minute.

813
01:02:38,115 --> 01:02:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

814
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey all our listeners, this is GS68 with a public service announcement.

815
01:02:51,912 --> 01:02:54,653
[SPEAKER_00]: When playing Super Smash Brothers, do not have fun.

816
01:02:55,153 --> 01:02:56,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not play with items on.

817
01:02:57,134 --> 01:02:59,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Items ruin the balance of the game and add randomness.

818
01:02:59,915 --> 01:03:01,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not pick low-tier characters.

819
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:04,137
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll not win with them, no matter what.

820
01:03:04,637 --> 01:03:07,799
[SPEAKER_00]: The best Bowser player will always lose to the worst Fox player.

821
01:03:08,419 --> 01:03:10,300
[SPEAKER_00]: The only stage allowed is Final Destination.

822
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,741
[SPEAKER_00]: If a stage has more than a flat plane on it, it's bad.

823
01:03:14,301 --> 01:03:16,862
[SPEAKER_00]: It ruins the balance of the game by giving characters advantages.

824
01:03:17,382 --> 01:03:19,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your F-Zero gimmicks and shove it.

825
01:03:19,783 --> 01:03:22,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge stages like Howard Castle are for camping morons.

826
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:27,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Smashville is barely acceptable because there's a freaking moving platform on top of the main platform.

827
01:03:28,106 --> 01:03:29,247
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, remember,

828
01:03:29,947 --> 01:03:32,508
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if you're at a party and just want to have fun with your friends.

829
01:03:33,028 --> 01:03:34,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Video games are not about fun.

830
01:03:34,748 --> 01:03:35,669
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about winning.

831
01:03:36,009 --> 01:03:39,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So shut the fuck up and stop having fun because video games are serious business.

832
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:41,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and good night.

833
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:46,092
[SPEAKER_00]: This PSA was brought to you by Mushroomy Kingdom, of the never-ending scrolling bullshit.

834
01:03:47,252 --> 01:03:48,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

835
01:03:48,932 --> 01:03:54,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Be sure to navigate through the forums and find the OL Archive, where you can find such clips as this.

836
01:03:57,692 --> 01:03:59,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking hate this game!

837
01:03:59,913 --> 01:04:01,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Goddamn you, Konami!

838
01:04:01,534 --> 01:04:02,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Goddamn you!

839
01:04:26,582 --> 01:04:29,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah yes, the good old days of Orange Lounge Radio.

840
01:04:29,863 --> 01:04:32,524
[SPEAKER_09]: That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter closet, wasn't it?

841
01:04:32,684 --> 01:04:33,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

842
01:04:33,344 --> 01:04:34,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was one of those weekends.

843
01:04:34,664 --> 01:04:36,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when Karaoke Revolution was funny.

844
01:04:37,485 --> 01:04:40,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, thanks to our listeners who provided the bumpers that break.

845
01:04:40,646 --> 01:04:43,727
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 was the first one and PKJR92.

846
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:47,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the second one, so thank you guys so much for those bumpers.

847
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:50,390
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a bumper you want to send, go look at the forums.

848
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:59,894
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole post about us accepting things for our free break, and that would be fake PSAs, promos for non-profit shows and things like that, and so on.

849
01:04:59,954 --> 01:05:01,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So hope to get some stuff from you.

850
01:05:03,248 --> 01:05:07,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 3rd of 2008.

851
01:05:08,173 --> 01:05:15,521
[SPEAKER_04]: For more Orange Lounge Radio gaming news, gaming chat, gaming bitching, and whatever we can come up with.

852
01:05:15,621 --> 01:05:17,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how about some Xbox news?

853
01:05:18,174 --> 01:05:22,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so there's another rumor coming out.

854
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:23,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, another one.

855
01:05:24,016 --> 01:05:25,297
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

856
01:05:25,517 --> 01:05:37,562
[SPEAKER_13]: This one actually has come from Ars Technica, and apparently they have their Microsoft insider who lets them know all the wonderful rumors and information and stuff like that.

857
01:05:38,222 --> 01:05:39,123
[SPEAKER_13]: They were once...

858
01:05:40,123 --> 01:05:42,185
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

859
01:06:02,523 --> 01:06:03,964
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess by that time they'll be all gone.

860
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:13,673
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going to happen is the Elite's going to drop down to $399 from $449, so that's a pretty nice drop there, another $50.

861
01:06:14,974 --> 01:06:24,983
[SPEAKER_13]: The 68 system will drop down to what the Pro system is now for $299, and the Arcade system will drop from $279 to $199.

862
01:06:27,745 --> 01:06:29,806
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's pretty cool.

863
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:35,829
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently around that time also the hard drive is supposed to... The 120 hard drive is supposed to drop in price.

864
01:06:35,849 --> 01:06:37,690
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think probably the 60 as well.

865
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:40,031
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll be coming out at some point.

866
01:06:41,211 --> 01:06:52,696
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other interesting thing about that that kind of coincides with all that is there was some screenshots on VGCharts apparently from the inside of their...

867
01:06:54,333 --> 01:07:05,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Some system, I don't know what store this is from, but it's saying that the price drop is going to happen, confirmed on the arcade system on September 7th, 2008.

868
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:14,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So that seems to give this a little more legitimacy than when this rumor usually flies around, because I was just about to ask, what makes this any different from any other price cut rumor?

869
01:07:14,383 --> 01:07:15,164
[SPEAKER_13]: XBOX 360 XBOX 360

870
01:07:31,404 --> 01:07:33,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Infinite Undiscovery, and Rock Band 2.

871
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:35,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, a time exclusive for Rock Band 2.

872
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:42,311
[SPEAKER_13]: But I say it's because the PlayStation 3 exclusives are going to be coming out around that time too.

873
01:07:43,012 --> 01:07:50,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, they're going to start coming out with a lot of their big PlayStation exclusives around October.

874
01:07:51,037 --> 01:07:55,920
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they kind of get a jump on everything, especially now that they're talking about putting out a core...

875
01:07:56,921 --> 01:07:58,102
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.com

876
01:08:19,702 --> 01:08:20,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Wii $1.99 or is Wii $2.50?

877
01:08:20,704 --> 01:08:24,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, see, they're going to be cheaper than the Wii at this point.

878
01:08:24,532 --> 01:08:25,193
[SPEAKER_04]: That's huge.

879
01:08:26,316 --> 01:08:27,398
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really huge, I think.

880
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Nintendo's going to have to follow suit?

881
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:30,164
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

882
01:08:31,294 --> 01:08:32,735
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess not, Wii's are still in demand.

883
01:08:51,636 --> 01:08:51,916
[SPEAKER_13]: XBOX ZOMBIES

884
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:19,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I love zombies.

885
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:37,611
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX LIVE Arcade Game

886
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,559
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

887
01:10:17,216 --> 01:10:18,657
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't you think it would be cool?

888
01:10:19,398 --> 01:10:20,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer is, yes.

889
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:23,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombies are always cool.

890
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Zombies are fantastic.

891
01:10:25,582 --> 01:10:26,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have a chat room.

892
01:10:26,463 --> 01:10:26,923
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

893
01:10:26,983 --> 01:10:28,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes or no to zombies on Xbox Live?

894
01:10:28,805 --> 01:10:31,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for more of the board game type fare on Xbox Live Arcade, too.

895
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:32,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those games are fun.

896
01:10:34,729 --> 01:10:36,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and other fun.

897
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:39,853
[SPEAKER_09]: And this makes me particularly happy because you know I love Valve.

898
01:10:41,334 --> 01:10:41,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

899
01:10:42,395 --> 01:10:42,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

900
01:10:43,226 --> 01:10:56,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know that there's going to be a Portal Still Alive coming out on Xbox Live, but it looks like Valve is really considering bringing other titles from their services.

901
01:10:56,534 --> 01:10:57,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's pretty cool.

902
01:10:58,276 --> 01:11:03,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And that they actually don't yet have any immediate plans to try the Wii or PS3.

903
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:07,682
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hey, they love you, Microsoft Xbox owners.

904
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:09,783
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the love of Valve.

905
01:11:10,706 --> 01:11:16,508
[SPEAKER_09]: indeed very much but you do not have GLaDOS in this one and that is not as great

906
01:11:17,393 --> 01:11:19,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think it's kind of a money milking thing?

907
01:11:20,015 --> 01:11:22,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of a cheap... All business is money milking when you think about it.

908
01:11:22,956 --> 01:11:23,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's true.

909
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:29,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Only if you're a non-profit organization do you not look to make a profit, right?

910
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:29,600
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

911
01:11:30,421 --> 01:11:37,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Commenting to a question Lieutenant Plissken asked in chat, says, can you put a hard drive in the no hard drive model of the 360?

912
01:11:37,805 --> 01:11:41,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say you want to download Portal Still Alive and these other possible future Valve releases.

913
01:11:42,388 --> 01:11:43,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can.

914
01:11:43,129 --> 01:11:44,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put a hard drive in the core model.

915
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:45,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very easy.

916
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:46,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

917
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:13,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times, because I came on here and I bitched, whined, and moaned on the show so bad.

918
01:12:13,524 --> 01:12:14,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so pissed.

919
01:12:15,004 --> 01:12:16,324
[SPEAKER_04]: But all's better now in Rob's world.

920
01:12:17,264 --> 01:12:22,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially after the yumminess of Soul Calibur 4 and Geometry Wars 2 this week.

921
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:28,406
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm going to have to get that Geometry Wars, I think.

922
01:12:29,206 --> 01:12:30,106
[SPEAKER_04]: At least get the demo.

923
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:35,027
[SPEAKER_04]: The demo, from what I hear, is almost the full deadline mode, which is get as many points as you can in three minutes.

924
01:12:35,367 --> 01:12:37,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a really good way to test if you're going to like the game or not.

925
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:39,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So, at least get the demo.

926
01:12:42,853 --> 01:12:44,014
[SPEAKER_13]: So, let's move on.

927
01:12:44,355 --> 01:12:45,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, shit.

928
01:12:45,856 --> 01:12:47,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you over there.

929
01:12:47,638 --> 01:12:51,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you guys were still talking about freaking Geometry Wars.

930
01:12:51,602 --> 01:12:52,103
[SPEAKER_13]: I was waiting.

931
01:12:52,683 --> 01:12:53,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, so...

932
01:12:55,148 --> 01:13:06,176
[SPEAKER_13]: You may remember that the Bourne Supremacy just came out beginning of June and that was part of the whole Vividi license and stuff, actually Sierra Entertainment.

933
01:13:06,656 --> 01:13:23,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Well now that they've been purchased by Activision and Blizzard have merged together, they're starting to, or Activision and Vividi and Blizzard and all those companies have merged together, they're starting to kind of go through what franchises they own and kind of slim it down a bit.

934
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:28,397
[SPEAKER_13]: and one of those franchises, of course, is The Bourne Supremacy.

935
01:13:31,235 --> 01:13:32,656
[SPEAKER_13]: or Born Conspiracy, I'm sorry.

936
01:13:33,938 --> 01:13:35,959
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually the whole Born lineup.

937
01:13:36,019 --> 01:13:38,582
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, there's some other stuff about that as well.

938
01:13:38,942 --> 01:13:49,472
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're actually giving back the Born Conspiracy to Lundrum Entertainment because Robert Lundrum, of course, was the guy that wrote the Born books.

939
01:13:50,072 --> 01:13:51,473
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's kind of going back to them.

940
01:13:51,554 --> 01:13:54,476
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess, I don't know if they want to put any other games out.

941
01:13:54,716 --> 01:13:56,118
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to find a new publisher, I guess.

942
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:57,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

943
01:13:59,321 --> 01:14:02,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, it didn't just stop there with the Bourne series.

944
01:14:03,922 --> 01:14:07,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision, Blizzard, they're kind of looking at some of the other franchises as well.

945
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:13,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the franchises that were rumored this week, Brutal Legend, Ghostbusters, the video game, were supposed to be lost.

946
01:14:14,224 --> 01:14:15,924
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually came out a little later in the week.

947
01:14:15,964 --> 01:14:16,825
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not true.

948
01:14:16,905 --> 01:14:21,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Ghostbusters, absolutely not canceled, according to Vivendi Sierra.

949
01:14:21,846 --> 01:14:22,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Not canceled.

950
01:14:22,626 --> 01:14:23,406
[SPEAKER_04]: That is still happening.

951
01:14:24,286 --> 01:14:28,227
[SPEAKER_04]: The spokesperson for Sierra had actually said, quote, First and foremost, the game is not canceled.

952
01:14:28,827 --> 01:14:31,128
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the game may not have a publisher right now.

953
01:14:31,588 --> 01:14:33,909
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a little more in the blue there.

954
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:37,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Brutal Legend is fine.

955
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:42,171
[SPEAKER_04]: So that series is still supposed to be on the way.

956
01:14:42,251 --> 01:14:47,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's really weird, though, that they would keep Spyro, Crash, and all that stuff and get rid of, I don't know, the good games.

957
01:14:47,973 --> 01:14:49,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Spyro's kind of a money machine.

958
01:14:50,113 --> 01:14:50,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and they kept 50 Cent.

959
01:14:52,014 --> 01:14:53,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Blood in the Sand, or whatever that thing is.

960
01:14:54,175 --> 01:14:55,456
[SPEAKER_04]: That game sounds very interesting.

961
01:14:56,236 --> 01:14:59,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Chronicles of Riddick, apparently, was booted to the curb, too.

962
01:14:59,258 --> 01:15:02,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but that, I think, was a long ways away anyway.

963
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just hope they didn't get rid of the Island of Dr. Brain.

964
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:05,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right?

965
01:15:07,342 --> 01:15:07,662
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

966
01:15:08,143 --> 01:15:10,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Island of Dr. Brain was an awesome Sierra game.

967
01:15:10,804 --> 01:15:12,365
[SPEAKER_04]: If you say so.

968
01:15:13,567 --> 01:15:19,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder, you remember, it was probably like a year ago, we had those kids that were making The Silver Lining, remember that?

969
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:41,342
[SPEAKER_04]: The unofficial King's Quest sequel The Silver Lining, and then they went through that whole song and dance where they had to lose the King's Quest ties, and now the game is just being released as The Silver Lining I wonder if all this recent, you know, mergey merge news means maybe they can get away with doing it as a King's Quest game again I doubt it, but it's still nice to imagine I suppose, if you want to keep dreaming Yeah, I know

970
01:15:42,352 --> 01:15:42,812
[SPEAKER_09]: The Hay.

971
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:46,294
[SPEAKER_09]: If we didn't have Dreamers, we also wouldn't have Bums.

972
01:15:46,454 --> 01:15:47,775
[SPEAKER_09]: So, kidding.

973
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Lieutenant Plissken makes a very excellent point in chat.

974
01:15:50,736 --> 01:15:51,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.orange.com.

975
01:15:52,377 --> 01:15:54,058
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 cent greater than Chronicles of Riddick?

976
01:15:54,218 --> 01:15:55,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Question mark, exclamation point.

977
01:15:55,658 --> 01:15:56,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Both great.

978
01:15:57,839 --> 01:15:58,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Question mark, question mark.

979
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,281
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what we need?

980
01:16:00,321 --> 01:16:08,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of movie franchises from 10 years ago, when I went to see The Dark Knight the other day, they were showing on the screen a preview for Starship Troopers 3.

981
01:16:10,186 --> 01:16:11,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did we never get a video game for that?

982
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:59,699
[SPEAKER_09]: well you know I'm not sure if everyone's familiar but there were screen captures and video out for Soul Calibur 4 that was showing Darth Vader and Yoda in the same game which as we knew Yoda was in the Xbox 360 edition and Darth Vader was in the PS3 one and the director of the game Katsuto Shisasaki said that they don't have any plans for making either one downloadable content for either console

983
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:11,280
[SPEAKER_09]: um but then again apparently those screen captures and uh and the video that was out are supposed to be legitimate you know actual same versions of the game so

984
01:17:13,146 --> 01:17:19,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, I mean, maybe that was just like a... I would assume that in programming both characters would have been included, right?

985
01:17:19,493 --> 01:17:22,877
[SPEAKER_09]: So it might just be from the developer's kit or something.

986
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:30,445
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it could be either from the developer's kit or there's a rumor floating around and you really would have to read in between the lines.

987
01:17:30,765 --> 01:17:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's saying it's not going to be download content, right?

988
01:17:33,588 --> 01:17:45,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the rumors that are going around say that if you buy The Force Unleashed, the game that The Apprentice or Starkiller is actually starring in, it unlocks the other Star Wars character on your respective system.

989
01:17:45,476 --> 01:17:46,157
[SPEAKER_09]: That's smart.

990
01:17:46,957 --> 01:17:48,378
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an interesting way of doing it.

991
01:17:48,518 --> 01:17:52,160
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a way of saying, hey, buy this game and please don't think that it sucks.

992
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,943
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not download content.

993
01:17:56,623 --> 01:18:00,086
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the biggest version of Pay to Unlock ever.

994
01:18:00,766 --> 01:18:06,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the question is then, if that's the case, then I wonder if it's a save file or something like that.

995
01:18:07,651 --> 01:18:08,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

996
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:12,054
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other thing to consider, there's a trailer for the Force Unleashed in the game.

997
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:17,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure that's part of how they were able to negotiate Starkiller and Yoda being in the game.

998
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: But just very interesting.

999
01:18:18,619 --> 01:18:20,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of makes you think, ah, maybe this is it.

1000
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:22,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what you did there.

1001
01:18:22,562 --> 01:18:26,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I would bet 10 to 1 that's going to be the way you unlock it, is that you have to get Force Unleashed.

1002
01:18:27,205 --> 01:18:29,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means they'll be impossible to find on Gamefly.

1003
01:18:29,567 --> 01:18:37,312
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wonder if having the fact that you have Soul Calibur IV, if that unlocks something for you on the Force Unleashed.

1004
01:18:37,832 --> 01:18:38,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

1005
01:18:38,753 --> 01:18:43,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe an alternate costume for Starkiller, since he does have two in Soul Calibur.

1006
01:18:43,716 --> 01:18:44,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1007
01:18:45,117 --> 01:18:46,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a little silly, but you never know.

1008
01:18:46,919 --> 01:18:48,440
[SPEAKER_04]: The unlocks aren't always that great.

1009
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:50,272
[SPEAKER_04]: They should just chain them.

1010
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:55,037
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll have something else and then you'll unlock... Just time release Vader.

1011
01:18:55,437 --> 01:18:57,800
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like three months from now, just time release him.

1012
01:18:58,180 --> 01:18:59,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Do a patch that unlocks him.

1013
01:18:59,762 --> 01:19:01,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obvious something's going to go there.

1014
01:19:01,644 --> 01:19:04,187
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one square in the game that is not filled in.

1015
01:19:04,647 --> 01:19:06,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look on the PlayStation... That goes for nobody.

1016
01:19:06,789 --> 01:19:07,570
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very obvious.

1017
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:08,812
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like, you know...

1018
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,467
[SPEAKER_13]: One for me and one for my homies.

1019
01:19:11,487 --> 01:19:17,929
[SPEAKER_04]: They looped like six characters in one screen, the star screen, not to be confused with Starkiller.

1020
01:19:18,109 --> 01:19:25,111
[SPEAKER_04]: They had famous anime creators make Soul Calibur characters, but they're just all filed under the star icon in the select menu.

1021
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:26,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them are pretty cool, actually.

1022
01:19:26,912 --> 01:19:28,733
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, sorry, getting off topic.

1023
01:19:29,173 --> 01:19:29,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1024
01:19:30,773 --> 01:19:31,554
[SPEAKER_13]: That's interesting, though.

1025
01:19:32,194 --> 01:19:32,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Good theory.

1026
01:19:33,752 --> 01:19:34,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Star Wars, The Shit Game

1027
01:20:03,984 --> 01:20:18,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Really strange stuff in there, from a level with crashing planes to a giant foot like Monty Python, floating eyeballs, fire, all sorts of crazy stuff.

1028
01:20:18,673 --> 01:20:26,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, the game is very short, but it challenges you to try to beat it, losing the least amount of lives and getting through it quickly.

1029
01:20:26,857 --> 01:20:30,219
[SPEAKER_13]: There are a lot of quick ways you can glitch through the game.

1030
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Monty Python's Flying Circus I knew this was coming

1031
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:04,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and the best part about the game, I forgot to mention, is that all the music in it is MIDI.

1032
01:21:05,394 --> 01:21:09,237
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's all like, you know, like pop music MIDI.

1033
01:21:11,139 --> 01:21:18,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Like they have Spice Girls in there, and it's all randomly selected to, like Lanny Kravitz and Spice Girls and stuff.

1034
01:21:19,365 --> 01:21:24,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that from here on out, all the rest of Loki's story should be done to Monty Python's Flying Circus opening.

1035
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:26,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we can arrange that.

1036
01:21:27,912 --> 01:21:28,333
Okay.

1037
01:21:29,554 --> 01:21:29,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1038
01:21:33,069 --> 01:21:33,950
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how that works.

1039
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:34,250
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try.

1040
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the thing, though.

1041
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't this be Shit Game 2?

1042
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:39,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've played Ping Pals.

1043
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:43,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's Shit Game 3, because I've also played Yaris.

1044
01:21:43,558 --> 01:21:44,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I see.

1045
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,121
[SPEAKER_13]: But see, that's the thing, is this game's actually better.

1046
01:21:47,882 --> 01:21:51,065
[SPEAKER_13]: But seriously, though, the character looks like he's made from MS Paint, and I think he was.

1047
01:21:52,606 --> 01:21:54,748
[SPEAKER_09]: He looked... Oh, it was hilarious.

1048
01:21:54,788 --> 01:21:55,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched the video of it.

1049
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:57,910
[SPEAKER_09]: I did download the game before the show.

1050
01:21:58,311 --> 01:22:00,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Haven't played it yet, but I'm gonna give it a try.

1051
01:22:01,035 --> 01:22:01,556
[SPEAKER_04]: The FUs of the Week

1052
01:22:36,007 --> 01:22:43,088
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week, um, it first of all goes towards my cat and her passengers.

1053
01:22:44,108 --> 01:22:46,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I have had to bathe the cat today.

1054
01:22:47,389 --> 01:22:50,810
[SPEAKER_09]: She has bad fleas, and they did not all wash off.

1055
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:58,331
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have to get a hold of Heather, you know, I have to get a hold of Heather and get some front lines for my kitty cat.

1056
01:22:58,531 --> 01:23:00,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know Heather, but the listeners don't know Heather.

1057
01:23:00,491 --> 01:23:01,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Heather is awesome!

1058
01:23:01,772 --> 01:23:02,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's all you need to know.

1059
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:03,552
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all you need to know.

1060
01:23:05,683 --> 01:23:07,284
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1061
01:23:36,075 --> 01:23:37,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your FU's of the week

1062
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:08,747
[SPEAKER_13]: with their cell phones and just driving fucking slow and just really annoying in fact this woman actually she drove through the parking lot really slow

1063
01:24:10,008 --> 01:24:16,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my other favorite thing is when there's a slight dip in the road or something like that and people slow the fuck down.

1064
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:22,992
[SPEAKER_13]: When they're in an SUV, an off-roading vehicle, and they slow the fuck down because it's a little dip in the road.

1065
01:24:23,832 --> 01:24:25,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that's also annoying.

1066
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:30,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a point though, somebody talking on the cell phone in their parking lot wouldn't technically be illegal.

1067
01:24:30,794 --> 01:24:31,715
[SPEAKER_13]: They're still driving.

1068
01:24:32,295 --> 01:24:35,536
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but technically they can't pull you over in the parking lot.

1069
01:24:36,274 --> 01:24:38,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, she's still driving around, so that still counts.

1070
01:24:38,457 --> 01:24:39,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a technicality.

1071
01:24:39,337 --> 01:24:39,798
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying.

1072
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:41,600
[SPEAKER_13]: And I followed her there, so.

1073
01:24:42,021 --> 01:24:47,587
[SPEAKER_13]: But she's a dumb bitch, and I actually thought about knocking on her window and going, get off the fucking phone, ass.

1074
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:50,250
[SPEAKER_13]: But no, I had better things to do.

1075
01:24:50,779 --> 01:24:51,359
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to Clothes Shopping

1076
01:25:07,146 --> 01:25:28,440
[SPEAKER_04]: but I went to Mervin's this week because I heard they were filing chapter 11 bankruptcy and I want to make sure I get all the good sales before the chain goes under and also thanks to me being sick earlier this year and the diet that has resulted I've lost another waist size so I had to buy all new jeans and that's expensive clothes are expensive so F you to expensive clothes

1077
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But a non-FU to Mervin's and a non-FU to Mervin's sales.

1078
01:25:33,923 --> 01:25:35,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Because those are both awesome.

1079
01:25:36,304 --> 01:25:37,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Still need to go to the outlets though this week.

1080
01:25:38,326 --> 01:25:39,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the outlets are the best thing ever.

1081
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,281
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get back into some gaming news.

1082
01:26:05,675 --> 01:26:11,599
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you think about it, you could go all the way back to the Wii NES Retro port.

1083
01:26:11,879 --> 01:26:24,227
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a device that was released that allows you to, yes, plug in your old school NES controller and play Mega Man 9 the way it might have been meant to be played with the old school NES controller.

1084
01:26:25,168 --> 01:26:25,969
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

1085
01:26:26,129 --> 01:26:29,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this worth going through the hassle just to play with the old school NES controller?

1086
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:29,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1087
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:30,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

1088
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:31,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Just use the Wiimote.

1089
01:26:31,432 --> 01:26:32,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that sounds like fun.

1090
01:26:32,713 --> 01:26:35,315
[SPEAKER_04]: It does sound like a challenge.

1091
01:26:36,015 --> 01:26:37,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And who doesn't love a challenge?

1092
01:26:37,516 --> 01:26:42,880
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like another excuse for G4 to bring out their giant NES controller to do something stupid on TV.

1093
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:43,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Yippee!

1094
01:26:45,322 --> 01:26:45,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait.

1095
01:26:46,022 --> 01:26:51,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of curiosity, would this sway you to buy this on the Wii, or are you still like, eh, not good enough, I'm still going to get it on 360?

1096
01:26:52,186 --> 01:26:52,627
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1097
01:26:54,048 --> 01:26:54,948
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of where I'm at.

1098
01:26:55,008 --> 01:27:00,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, that's cute, cute, but I may still get it on the Wii.

1099
01:27:03,735 --> 01:27:05,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still on my silly boycott.

1100
01:27:05,856 --> 01:27:06,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no room.

1101
01:27:07,117 --> 01:27:07,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I stand.

1102
01:27:08,238 --> 01:27:09,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, Rob.

1103
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:10,820
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't have to purchase it.

1104
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:14,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I will get it on the 360, I'm sure.

1105
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:17,564
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like the prospect of being able to use the old controller.

1106
01:27:17,584 --> 01:27:18,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't they put it on the DS?

1107
01:27:19,005 --> 01:27:23,108
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to put another Mega Man collection on the DS and release this along with it.

1108
01:27:23,408 --> 01:27:27,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Capcom might release a remake of the game later on?

1109
01:27:27,191 --> 01:27:28,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they've never done that before.

1110
01:27:28,992 --> 01:27:30,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Never ever, right?

1111
01:27:30,414 --> 01:27:33,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there might be a Mega Man 9 Championship Turbo Edition next year?

1112
01:27:34,099 --> 01:27:34,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I doubt it.

1113
01:27:36,161 --> 01:27:36,702
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

1114
01:27:36,862 --> 01:27:37,283
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

1115
01:27:38,874 --> 01:27:41,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, moving forward, and forward is a good way to move.

1116
01:27:42,495 --> 01:27:46,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami wants to hop on the old school bandwagon.

1117
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, well, everyone else is doing it, why can't they?

1118
01:27:50,738 --> 01:27:53,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then again, they were already doing the Castlevania one, right?

1119
01:27:54,099 --> 01:27:54,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Rumored.

1120
01:27:54,619 --> 01:27:56,340
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, well, here's more rumor.

1121
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:00,621
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually an EGM put up by WeFanboy.

1122
01:28:01,441 --> 01:28:02,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Said that...

1123
01:28:04,082 --> 01:28:15,354
[SPEAKER_09]: In the September 2008 issue, there will be one of the most beloved yet overlooked action-adventure franchises of yore will soon get a surprise retro-revival sequel.

1124
01:28:18,698 --> 01:28:19,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm.

1125
01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:21,301
[SPEAKER_13]: It better not be Bomberman.

1126
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:24,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I do love Bomberman, but we've already had Bomberman.

1127
01:28:24,524 --> 01:28:25,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Going on!

1128
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:32,201
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be... What if it was Turtles Tournament Fighter?

1129
01:28:33,101 --> 01:28:33,782
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

1130
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:35,963
[SPEAKER_04]: They lost the Turtles license to EA.

1131
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:36,543
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1132
01:28:36,663 --> 01:28:37,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn.

1133
01:28:37,443 --> 01:28:40,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Or it could be... No, they lost it to Ubisoft.

1134
01:28:41,265 --> 01:28:46,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Or it could be... Lucky O'Hare!

1135
01:28:46,506 --> 01:28:48,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Gradius, since they already said they were going to do Gradius.

1136
01:28:48,447 --> 01:28:49,488
[SPEAKER_13]: We did talk about Gradius a couple weeks ago.

1137
01:28:49,848 --> 01:28:50,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1138
01:28:50,468 --> 01:28:50,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

1139
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:53,729
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a bunch of stuff?

1140
01:28:54,349 --> 01:28:55,670
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Blades of Steel?

1141
01:28:58,749 --> 01:28:59,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft suggests double dribble.

1142
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:22,770
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Skate or Die?

1143
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:23,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that a Konami game?

1144
01:29:23,711 --> 01:29:24,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was.

1145
01:29:24,472 --> 01:29:26,635
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was Ultra Games.

1146
01:29:28,017 --> 01:29:29,579
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was Skate or Die.

1147
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:30,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

1148
01:29:31,482 --> 01:29:31,842
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1149
01:29:32,623 --> 01:29:33,925
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think they would do that game.

1150
01:29:34,943 --> 01:29:35,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Earthworm Jim Earthworm Jim

1151
01:30:01,517 --> 01:30:03,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the opening to Earthworm Jim?

1152
01:30:03,219 --> 01:30:03,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

1153
01:30:05,021 --> 01:30:05,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Some other things.

1154
01:30:06,323 --> 01:30:08,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Ys Book 1 and 2 will be coming out.

1155
01:30:09,486 --> 01:30:11,388
[SPEAKER_13]: And Samurai Showdown 2.

1156
01:30:12,489 --> 01:30:13,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that was the best one.

1157
01:30:15,352 --> 01:30:16,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Ys a CD game?

1158
01:30:18,029 --> 01:30:18,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Or am I wrong?

1159
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:23,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to say that the East Book 1 and 2 came out on CD.

1160
01:30:24,219 --> 01:30:28,646
[SPEAKER_09]: So the two games were released as a single CD.

1161
01:30:29,026 --> 01:30:30,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we gotten CD games here yet?

1162
01:30:30,789 --> 01:30:31,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1163
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:31,771
[SPEAKER_04]: We have?

1164
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:32,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1165
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:34,199
[SPEAKER_09]: They got Dracula X in Japan, didn't they?

1166
01:30:34,599 --> 01:30:35,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I knew they were coming.

1167
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't know we had any yet.

1168
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:38,280
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1169
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:41,441
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, the Ys games are good now.

1170
01:30:41,461 --> 01:30:44,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I might actually... I don't have room for Ys.

1171
01:30:45,882 --> 01:30:46,422
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, Rob?

1172
01:30:46,502 --> 01:30:47,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what.

1173
01:30:47,302 --> 01:30:48,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Just come over to my house.

1174
01:30:48,102 --> 01:30:49,402
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll hook up the PC engine.

1175
01:30:49,622 --> 01:30:49,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Deal!

1176
01:30:52,763 --> 01:30:54,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, Loki, coming out?

1177
01:30:54,804 --> 01:30:55,144
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1178
01:30:55,624 --> 01:30:55,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1179
01:30:56,324 --> 01:30:57,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there might be more.

1180
01:30:58,052 --> 01:30:58,632
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft 2 and Diablo 3

1181
01:31:27,561 --> 01:31:30,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, they're going to have achievements as well.

1182
01:31:31,206 --> 01:31:38,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Every achievement earned is going to go towards this Blizzard level that every Blizzard user is going to use.

1183
01:31:38,776 --> 01:31:44,564
[SPEAKER_04]: You could basically think of it like an Xbox Live type thing where you have a gamer score but now you're going to have a Blizzard level.

1184
01:31:45,064 --> 01:31:46,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Achievement Horror Loki, are you excited?

1185
01:32:15,422 --> 01:32:17,463
[SPEAKER_13]: But you don't really play Blizzard games on the computer, do you?

1186
01:32:17,723 --> 01:32:18,923
[SPEAKER_13]: No, well, I used to.

1187
01:32:18,943 --> 01:32:21,884
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to play, like, what was it?

1188
01:32:21,924 --> 01:32:23,025
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to play StarCraft.

1189
01:32:23,345 --> 01:32:25,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Or not StarCraft, World of Warcraft.

1190
01:32:25,546 --> 01:32:26,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Not World of Warcraft.

1191
01:32:26,646 --> 01:32:27,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Warcraft!

1192
01:32:27,286 --> 01:32:29,047
[SPEAKER_13]: The original Warcraft and Diablo.

1193
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:31,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Never played Diablo 2, though.

1194
01:32:31,327 --> 01:32:31,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Should have.

1195
01:32:32,508 --> 01:32:33,088
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.

1196
01:32:34,677 --> 01:32:36,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just looking at a chat room here.

1197
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:40,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Pooface says, too bad the life of a Blizzard game lasts the same of a game console.

1198
01:32:41,242 --> 01:32:41,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1199
01:32:41,642 --> 01:32:43,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like Blizzard games last a long time.

1200
01:32:43,544 --> 01:32:47,266
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still people that freaking play Diablo 2 like it just came out yesterday.

1201
01:32:48,627 --> 01:32:51,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Lieutenant Plissken says, achievements are all the rage these days.

1202
01:32:51,409 --> 01:32:51,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, kind of.

1203
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:55,953
[SPEAKER_04]: You see trophies now and pretty soon I'm sure Nintendo will have something as well.

1204
01:32:56,033 --> 01:32:56,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1205
01:32:57,174 --> 01:32:57,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1206
01:32:58,843 --> 01:33:04,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, something else that is pretty, this makes me very, very, very happy.

1207
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:13,236
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a rumor now that Sega is going to be bringing back the Jet Set Radio games.

1208
01:33:14,717 --> 01:33:20,582
[SPEAKER_09]: As we know, there was a Dreamcast one, which we actually got as Jet Grind Radio, and then Xbox had Jet Set Radio Future.

1209
01:33:21,892 --> 01:33:23,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Jet Set Radio Game Boy Advance

1210
01:33:40,268 --> 01:33:42,569
[SPEAKER_09]: What if we had it on the iPhone?

1211
01:34:06,397 --> 01:34:06,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Too tiny.

1212
01:34:07,118 --> 01:34:07,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Too tiny.

1213
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:13,861
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been quoted as saying, well, the president of Sega is quoted as saying that the iPhone is the new Dreamcast.

1214
01:34:15,621 --> 01:34:16,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1215
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:19,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you imagine doing your graffiti with your finger?

1216
01:34:19,963 --> 01:34:21,104
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be kind of weird to me.

1217
01:34:21,144 --> 01:34:21,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1218
01:34:22,465 --> 01:34:23,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe for a little while.

1219
01:34:24,566 --> 01:34:25,006
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know.

1220
01:34:27,007 --> 01:34:28,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I do hope the rumor is true, though.

1221
01:34:28,827 --> 01:34:31,669
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I'd be calling the iPhone the new Dreamcast.

1222
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:32,029
[SPEAKER_13]: That's...

1223
01:34:33,863 --> 01:34:35,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a good thing to compare it to.

1224
01:34:35,526 --> 01:34:36,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, do you have some more news for us, Loki?

1225
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:38,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1226
01:34:45,441 --> 01:34:51,686
[SPEAKER_13]: with all these different systems coming out with their own achievement and trophy and whatever systems.

1227
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:56,230
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually going to be a new site to track all these at the same time.

1228
01:34:56,290 --> 01:35:04,917
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually being created by Rooster Teeth, who you may remember from the Red vs. Blue series, among all their other animated Makima series.

1229
01:35:05,317 --> 01:35:09,621
[SPEAKER_13]: But now they have a brand new website that's going to database all these.

1230
01:35:10,382 --> 01:35:11,663
[SPEAKER_13]: And that site is...

1231
01:35:14,605 --> 01:35:15,266
[SPEAKER_13]: What's it called?

1232
01:35:15,306 --> 01:35:15,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Small Rewards.

1233
01:35:16,126 --> 01:35:17,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Achievement Hunter, I'm sorry.

1234
01:35:17,527 --> 01:35:18,228
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it's called.

1235
01:35:18,969 --> 01:35:31,558
[SPEAKER_13]: And right now I know that they were saying that they're going to do the 360, the PS3, and of course the iPhone, and maybe of course they're going to add on these Blizzard ones as well.

1236
01:35:31,939 --> 01:35:32,699
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's pretty cool.

1237
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,822
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll have to track all these different sites.

1238
01:35:35,842 --> 01:35:38,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if they're going to have some sort of way to add them all together or something like that.

1239
01:35:42,607 --> 01:35:43,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that really necessary?

1240
01:35:44,912 --> 01:35:45,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's very necessary.

1241
01:35:45,593 --> 01:35:46,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it is kind of funny.

1242
01:35:46,733 --> 01:35:47,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

1243
01:35:47,194 --> 01:35:47,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1244
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:48,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's hilarious.

1245
01:35:48,395 --> 01:35:50,877
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, I'm liking the theme music for stories.

1246
01:35:53,659 --> 01:35:55,660
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I once listened to a gaming podcast.

1247
01:35:55,680 --> 01:36:06,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember who it was, but they actually play music in the background the entire show, which is cool because I think they play mostly indie bands and stuff, and it makes their show unique, so more power to them.

1248
01:36:06,689 --> 01:36:08,150
[SPEAKER_04]: But just kind of funny.

1249
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:10,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I never thought of doing theme music for stories.

1250
01:36:10,492 --> 01:36:11,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be cool.

1251
01:36:12,449 --> 01:36:18,076
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could actually, when we're talking about a certain game, have the music from the game playing in the background.

1252
01:36:18,096 --> 01:36:19,678
[SPEAKER_04]: But that takes a lot of coordinated effort.

1253
01:36:19,698 --> 01:36:20,579
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't even know.

1254
01:36:22,101 --> 01:36:23,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I would do it if we could.

1255
01:36:24,544 --> 01:36:27,948
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the meantime, you get Monty Python's Flying Circus.

1256
01:36:29,869 --> 01:36:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what theme music would be appropriate for this.

1257
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:36,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe something about moving on or something.

1258
01:36:37,031 --> 01:36:38,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that a DDR song, Moving On?

1259
01:36:38,951 --> 01:36:41,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Penny Arcade Expo is going to the East Coast in 2010.

1260
01:36:41,552 --> 01:36:43,032
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the current rumor going around.

1261
01:36:43,072 --> 01:36:44,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's not really a rumor.

1262
01:36:44,332 --> 01:36:49,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Tycho himself has said that Penny Arcade Expo is going to be going to the East Coast.

1263
01:36:49,493 --> 01:36:52,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And that doesn't mean that the West Coast show is going to go anywhere.

1264
01:36:53,114 --> 01:36:57,635
[SPEAKER_04]: They're turning PAX into multiple places at multiple times type events.

1265
01:36:58,315 --> 01:37:04,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, it's quoted by the Penny Arcade team has been quoted from saying, frankly, it should be global.

1266
01:37:05,557 --> 01:37:07,977
[SPEAKER_04]: An East Coast show is only the beginning.

1267
01:37:08,577 --> 01:37:13,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So one thing they might announce at Penny Arcade Expo this year is that there's going to be probably an East Coast show next year.

1268
01:37:13,778 --> 01:37:14,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And who knows?

1269
01:37:14,378 --> 01:37:15,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe something in Europe?

1270
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:16,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada?

1271
01:37:17,799 --> 01:37:18,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1272
01:37:19,659 --> 01:37:21,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere maybe outside the U.S.

1273
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:22,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawaii?

1274
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:23,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Australia?

1275
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Penny Arcade Expo Luxembourg.

1276
01:37:26,921 --> 01:37:27,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1277
01:37:28,448 --> 01:37:29,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Penny Arcade, Mozambique.

1278
01:37:29,909 --> 01:37:30,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be fun?

1279
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:31,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Monaco.

1280
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:36,013
[SPEAKER_03]: To Las Vegas or Monaco.

1281
01:37:36,693 --> 01:37:37,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Win a fortune in a game.

1282
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:39,635
[SPEAKER_03]: My life would never be the same.

1283
01:37:39,695 --> 01:37:40,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

1284
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:40,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.

1285
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:43,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get this part over with.

1286
01:37:43,898 --> 01:37:45,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's the mailbag, kids.

1287
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you email us.

1288
01:37:49,301 --> 01:37:50,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1289
01:37:50,762 --> 01:37:51,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's open up the mailbag.

1290
01:37:52,383 --> 01:37:53,564
[SPEAKER_04]: See what you guys have to say this week.

1291
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:57,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, did we ever get some doozies.

1292
01:37:58,345 --> 01:37:59,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to say doozy.

1293
01:37:59,946 --> 01:38:02,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, first of all, this comes from Dave.

1294
01:38:03,569 --> 01:38:04,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Dave!

1295
01:38:04,570 --> 01:38:05,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Dave.

1296
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:06,592
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't do that.

1297
01:38:07,773 --> 01:38:08,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1298
01:38:08,814 --> 01:38:11,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR crew, great work on the show.

1299
01:38:11,156 --> 01:38:18,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if any of you have checked out GiantBomb.com, the new website from former game spotter Jeff Gertzman and company.

1300
01:38:19,642 --> 01:38:22,184
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a potentially awesome game focused wiki.

1301
01:38:22,824 --> 01:38:24,525
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think of it if you've tried it?

1302
01:38:24,646 --> 01:38:32,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure there are tons of randomly awesome games on Sega systems in its desperate need of DarkSakura's careful attention.

1303
01:38:32,671 --> 01:38:35,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Love the show and other nice closing pleasantries.

1304
01:38:35,672 --> 01:38:36,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Forgive the shit punctuation.

1305
01:38:37,133 --> 01:38:38,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're forgiven.

1306
01:38:38,494 --> 01:38:39,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave from ye old England.

1307
01:38:41,363 --> 01:38:41,844
[SPEAKER_09]: You're forgiven.

1308
01:38:55,675 --> 01:38:57,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sleek, but here's the thing.

1309
01:38:57,716 --> 01:39:00,217
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want GameWiki, I usually go to Wikipedia.

1310
01:39:00,897 --> 01:39:08,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not exactly sure what is going to make me visit this site on a daily basis, which is what it's all about, right?

1311
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,021
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just some friendly feedback.

1312
01:39:10,041 --> 01:39:13,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to knock the site or anything because it's rather slick.

1313
01:39:13,462 --> 01:39:14,362
[SPEAKER_04]: It's put together rather well.

1314
01:39:15,763 --> 01:39:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think they'll get a lot of listeners and certainly they have some knowledgeable people from the gaming industry working for it but I'm not sure there's anything there just yet that's going to make me want to click reload every six hours you know what I mean?

1315
01:39:27,481 --> 01:39:28,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, our weekly letter from Cheeseburger.

1316
01:39:57,469 --> 01:39:59,270
[SPEAKER_04]: You know you don't have to read every single email.

1317
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:00,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do.

1318
01:40:00,771 --> 01:40:01,412
[SPEAKER_09]: No, mostly.

1319
01:40:02,112 --> 01:40:08,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey guys, today I got a subscription to Xbox Live with a headset, camera, and some other stuff, including two arcade games.

1320
01:40:09,317 --> 01:40:12,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I only have Halo 3 and no arcade games, so what arcade games do you think I should get?

1321
01:40:13,519 --> 01:40:17,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like sports and have things like Pac-Man be jeweled in Zuma on my iPod.

1322
01:40:18,643 --> 01:40:25,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're listening to Part A, I would tell you to go right now and get Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 because I think it's probably the best game on Xbox Live Arcade right now.

1323
01:40:25,927 --> 01:40:26,908
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Symphony of the Night.

1324
01:40:27,594 --> 01:40:29,855
[SPEAKER_04]: which is also a great game if you don't have a PS1.

1325
01:40:32,076 --> 01:40:32,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, good games.

1326
01:40:33,356 --> 01:40:36,618
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like music games, which a lot of our audience does, I don't know where you stand on that.

1327
01:40:37,518 --> 01:40:43,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Uno, but Every Extent Extra Extreme, maybe Luminous as well, would both be good things to look into.

1328
01:40:43,501 --> 01:40:45,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom Boom Rocket, if you like music games.

1329
01:40:47,222 --> 01:40:53,725
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not so much on music games, if you like role-playing games, the Penny Arcade game is actually pretty low-worthy, although it is a little more pricier.

1330
01:40:54,825 --> 01:40:58,646
[SPEAKER_04]: But stay away from some of those retro classic change games.

1331
01:40:58,787 --> 01:41:02,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I do like the Pac-Man, though, Tournament Edition.

1332
01:41:02,808 --> 01:41:03,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, yes.

1333
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:04,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, chat.

1334
01:41:04,549 --> 01:41:06,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Run, do not walk, Res HD.

1335
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:07,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah!

1336
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:09,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Which could also very well be the best game on Xbox Live Arcade.

1337
01:41:10,691 --> 01:41:12,412
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a virtual tie with Geometry Wars 2.

1338
01:41:14,129 --> 01:41:15,050
[SPEAKER_04]: They are both great.

1339
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:16,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So run, do not walk.

1340
01:41:16,231 --> 01:41:17,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Rez and Geometry Wars.

1341
01:41:17,732 --> 01:41:19,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man Championship Edition, honestly.

1342
01:41:20,094 --> 01:41:24,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you have the original on your iPhone or not, the Actdeft, I completely agree with what Actdeft is saying in chat.

1343
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:26,499
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter if you already have the original version.

1344
01:41:26,839 --> 01:41:27,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different enough.

1345
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:30,642
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing better than that, though, was the GameCube Pac-Man Versus.

1346
01:41:31,283 --> 01:41:33,584
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't get that on Xbox Live, so make do.

1347
01:41:33,865 --> 01:41:37,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So next up, hello Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.

1348
01:41:37,147 --> 01:41:38,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, emailer.

1349
01:41:39,346 --> 01:41:42,370
[SPEAKER_09]: First things first, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy listening to your show.

1350
01:41:42,711 --> 01:41:46,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Not all gaming podcasts are created equal, and yours is a testament to that.

1351
01:41:46,495 --> 01:41:46,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1352
01:41:58,130 --> 01:42:12,680
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura correctly pointed out that they are a business and their primary concern is making money, but I fear that their current hard-on for casual gamer is going to come back and bite them in the ass.

1353
01:42:14,187 --> 01:42:17,709
[SPEAKER_09]: The casual market is supporting them, but it will not sustain them.

1354
01:42:18,069 --> 01:42:20,951
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii has the lowest attack rate of all the current-gen consoles.

1355
01:42:21,311 --> 01:42:25,834
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact remains that it is still the hardcore gamers who are the lifeblood of the gaming companies.

1356
01:42:26,234 --> 01:42:37,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo has the most loyal fanbase of any of the big three, but if these hardcore fans are made to feel more and more alienated, not all of the Mario and Zelda sequels in the world will keep them from defecting to another camp.

1357
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:42,221
[SPEAKER_09]: that can offer them more, and by more I mean hassle-free online and disk-based storage.

1358
01:42:42,661 --> 01:42:52,403
[SPEAKER_09]: As someone who grew up with an NES controller in my hands, it disappoints me to see Nintendo apparently dropping me for kindergartners and soccer moms, and I now know I am not alone in this.

1359
01:42:52,463 --> 01:42:53,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki will back me up, I'm sure.

1360
01:42:54,383 --> 01:42:57,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep on rocking like the proverbial hurricane, raw fish and beer.

1361
01:42:57,484 --> 01:43:00,985
[SPEAKER_09]: This email is brought to you by Mixed Metaphors, home of the ass-biting hard-ons.

1362
01:43:02,625 --> 01:43:03,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1363
01:43:04,425 --> 01:43:07,226
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the best home of thing ever.

1364
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:09,311
[SPEAKER_04]: The beat goes on when Nintendo.

1365
01:43:09,872 --> 01:43:10,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Beat goes on.

1366
01:43:11,273 --> 01:43:11,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up.

1367
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:13,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR.

1368
01:43:13,255 --> 01:43:13,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

1369
01:43:14,576 --> 01:43:21,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Rob is a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and I wanted to know what his reaction was to the news of MTV creating a remake of the classic film.

1370
01:43:22,062 --> 01:43:25,485
[SPEAKER_09]: If he didn't know yet, I'm sorry to be the bearer of what I see as terrible news.

1371
01:43:25,705 --> 01:43:30,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Harry.

1372
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:32,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's...

1373
01:43:36,265 --> 01:43:42,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like to judge things until I see them or watch them or play them or whatever, but in this case, you just kind of know.

1374
01:43:44,591 --> 01:43:46,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the old Animaniacs segment?

1375
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Good idea, bad idea?

1376
01:43:49,274 --> 01:43:51,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad idea, this right here.

1377
01:43:52,556 --> 01:43:54,137
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my thought, though.

1378
01:43:55,318 --> 01:43:57,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we saw the redone play, right?

1379
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:58,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1380
01:43:58,945 --> 01:43:59,785
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was good.

1381
01:44:00,766 --> 01:44:10,991
[SPEAKER_09]: What if they had it carry, I guess, the updated music of the new play, but keep the feel of the old one?

1382
01:44:12,312 --> 01:44:13,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I don't want to judge it until I've seen it.

1383
01:44:14,192 --> 01:44:17,654
[SPEAKER_04]: A casting choice is very important, a lot of it that goes into it.

1384
01:44:17,694 --> 01:44:22,557
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want to say that everything MTV touches necessarily turns to shit, because, you know, rock band's cool.

1385
01:44:22,877 --> 01:44:25,118
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, this is the network that brought us The Hills.

1386
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:28,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean shit, enough said, right?

1387
01:44:30,315 --> 01:44:32,498
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the network that started reality TV.

1388
01:44:33,339 --> 01:44:37,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is kind of unnecessary, but it's also inevitable at the same time.

1389
01:44:38,325 --> 01:44:39,607
[SPEAKER_09]: If it ain't broke, don't

1390
01:44:41,043 --> 01:44:48,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked the idea better five years ago when the rumor was that the guy who did Priscilla Queen of the Desert was going to be remaking it with Alan Cumming playing Frank and Furter.

1391
01:44:48,627 --> 01:44:49,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, wouldn't that be great?

1392
01:44:50,008 --> 01:44:51,649
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I was totally fine with that.

1393
01:44:52,849 --> 01:44:55,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That would just be... Now we're five years later and the rumor's a little less cool.

1394
01:44:56,731 --> 01:44:57,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll see.

1395
01:44:58,973 --> 01:45:02,595
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, OLR needs a Wheel of Morality segment.

1396
01:45:02,835 --> 01:45:03,575
[SPEAKER_09]: We do!

1397
01:45:03,595 --> 01:45:06,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Wheel of Morality, turn, turn, turn.

1398
01:45:06,276 --> 01:45:08,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Show us the lesson that we should learn.

1399
01:45:08,818 --> 01:45:09,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

1400
01:45:10,432 --> 01:45:21,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Email, YoOLR, this be the GS68 Enough of the speaking in ghetto speak.

1401
01:45:21,105 --> 01:45:26,932
[SPEAKER_09]: In response to Actdeft's call last week, how people who play rock bands should learn real instruments, I'd like to say that

1402
01:45:29,895 --> 01:45:37,957
[SPEAKER_09]: People who play Wangan or Initial D should invest shitloads of money in a real car and then illegally street race down Highway 101 at 200 miles an hour.

1403
01:45:38,697 --> 01:45:41,558
[SPEAKER_09]: People who play Pokemon should capture real animals and train them.

1404
01:45:41,658 --> 01:45:42,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, PETA.

1405
01:45:42,558 --> 01:45:43,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's okay.

1406
01:45:43,159 --> 01:45:44,839
[SPEAKER_09]: PETA's a bunch of psycho assholes anyway.

1407
01:45:45,519 --> 01:45:49,420
[SPEAKER_09]: People who play GTA should learn to hijack cars and kill people in real life.

1408
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:52,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, he who shall not be named.

1409
01:45:53,479 --> 01:45:57,985
[SPEAKER_09]: People who play Mulana should explore real life ruins and get killed in the process.

1410
01:45:58,906 --> 01:46:01,730
[SPEAKER_09]: People who play Shoot Em Up should invest in a real space fighter jet.

1411
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:03,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wait, those don't exist.

1412
01:46:03,953 --> 01:46:05,595
[SPEAKER_09]: That is all, GS68.

1413
01:46:05,936 --> 01:46:06,296
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

1414
01:46:06,336 --> 01:46:09,521
[SPEAKER_09]: This email is brought to you by Tekken, home of the never-ending stages.

1415
01:46:12,588 --> 01:46:15,429
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ratchet makes a good point going back to the hills.

1416
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:16,930
[SPEAKER_04]: The hills makes the soup funny.

1417
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:17,831
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true.

1418
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:19,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Without MTV, the soup would not be nearly as funny.

1419
01:46:21,993 --> 01:46:22,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, to that other email.

1420
01:46:22,853 --> 01:46:23,293
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more email.

1421
01:46:23,534 --> 01:46:25,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, more email.

1422
01:46:25,415 --> 01:46:27,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Rob with 2B sent us a couple of stories.

1423
01:46:27,736 --> 01:46:28,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1424
01:46:28,636 --> 01:46:30,257
[SPEAKER_09]: And this one I think is hilarious.

1425
01:46:30,357 --> 01:46:34,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the top seven irritating female characters in video games.

1426
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:41,743
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the stupid ad would ever disappear because I fucking hate ads.

1427
01:46:45,489 --> 01:46:45,769
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1428
01:46:45,789 --> 01:46:49,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm about to just say screw this because I hate ads.

1429
01:46:50,793 --> 01:46:51,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

1430
01:46:51,794 --> 01:46:52,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's got to pay the bills.

1431
01:46:53,855 --> 01:46:57,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Number seven is Ashley Williams from Mass Effect.

1432
01:47:01,721 --> 01:47:02,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1433
01:47:02,622 --> 01:47:03,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't play Mass Effect.

1434
01:47:03,823 --> 01:47:04,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Six is Minnie Mouse.

1435
01:47:07,626 --> 01:47:10,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'm talking about... Mickey Mousecapade was awesome.

1436
01:47:10,488 --> 01:47:11,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Mickey Mousecapade.

1437
01:47:12,029 --> 01:47:13,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw whoever wrote that.

1438
01:47:13,729 --> 01:47:15,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Ashley Graham from Resident Evil 4.

1439
01:47:20,232 --> 01:47:20,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving forward.

1440
01:47:23,954 --> 01:47:25,134
[SPEAKER_09]: God, the internet sucks.

1441
01:47:26,515 --> 01:47:26,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1442
01:47:27,215 --> 01:47:31,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Four is Mikiko Ebihara from Daikatana.

1443
01:47:35,759 --> 01:47:38,720
[SPEAKER_09]: And then... Stupid webpage.

1444
01:47:41,841 --> 01:47:42,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up is...

1445
01:47:47,429 --> 01:47:51,592
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like... Catalina from Grand Theft Auto 3.

1446
01:47:53,834 --> 01:47:56,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the Beggar Lady in Assassin's Creed.

1447
01:47:57,857 --> 01:48:00,198
[SPEAKER_09]: And then our last ones on the list.

1448
01:48:00,799 --> 01:48:04,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one is Navi from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

1449
01:48:06,163 --> 01:48:07,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, listen!

1450
01:48:07,404 --> 01:48:08,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen!

1451
01:48:08,665 --> 01:48:09,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen!

1452
01:48:09,906 --> 01:48:10,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen!

1453
01:48:12,447 --> 01:48:12,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh...

1454
01:48:15,363 --> 01:48:17,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Yuna was not annoying!

1455
01:48:17,063 --> 01:48:18,844
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my roommate contributing there, Yuna.

1456
01:48:18,864 --> 01:48:19,904
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awful.

1457
01:48:20,024 --> 01:48:22,545
[SPEAKER_09]: She needed to die.

1458
01:48:22,565 --> 01:48:22,605
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

1459
01:48:25,085 --> 01:48:30,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, I think that's like the first time I think my roommate's kind of gotten into the video game discussion here on the program.

1460
01:48:30,246 --> 01:48:32,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually he turns his nose up at the show.

1461
01:48:33,447 --> 01:48:36,808
[SPEAKER_09]: He's cooking something that smells delightful right outside the door, though.

1462
01:48:37,645 --> 01:48:41,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what's funny is we have the Vornado bringing out... That's how we finally fixed our air conditioning problem.

1463
01:48:41,728 --> 01:48:45,110
[SPEAKER_04]: We bought a Vornado to suck in air conditioning from the house and blow it out here.

1464
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:49,192
[SPEAKER_04]: But tonight, since the roommate is cooking... It sucks and it blows.

1465
01:48:49,292 --> 01:48:54,576
[SPEAKER_04]: His very delightful dish is... We can smell nothing but that out here because it's sucking air from the kitchen.

1466
01:48:54,816 --> 01:48:56,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

1467
01:48:57,444 --> 01:49:00,368
[SPEAKER_09]: So another one from Rob.

1468
01:49:01,389 --> 01:49:06,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really read the article, but he said, I got this link in GamePolitics.com.

1469
01:49:06,735 --> 01:49:09,819
[SPEAKER_09]: A judge disenfranchises the class in class action suit.

1470
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:13,824
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's about the Grand Theft Auto thing.

1471
01:49:14,084 --> 01:49:15,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll link it in the chat room.

1472
01:49:16,466 --> 01:49:22,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually a little surprised since the original suit was not over state laws, but just about getting more than you paid for.

1473
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:29,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather be broken by proving the class didn't actually exist.

1474
01:49:33,414 --> 01:49:36,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I also retract my E3 2008 is boring comment.

1475
01:49:36,555 --> 01:49:41,537
[SPEAKER_09]: If you really dig into the third party games and the non-big announcements, there are a lot of good information.

1476
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:47,180
[SPEAKER_09]: My original opinion was based all on the A-list games news being leaked to the interwebs.

1477
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:49,621
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was spoiled for me.

1478
01:49:49,861 --> 01:49:53,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Level up, you now have three character points to apply towards your stats, Rob.

1479
01:49:53,582 --> 01:49:54,042
[SPEAKER_09]: With two Bs.

1480
01:49:55,603 --> 01:49:57,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just looking at this article real quick.

1481
01:49:57,364 --> 01:49:58,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I put three points in awesomeness?

1482
01:49:59,465 --> 01:49:59,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1483
01:50:00,025 --> 01:50:00,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1484
01:50:01,924 --> 01:50:15,066
[SPEAKER_09]: um it said that the settlement over the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas um uh settlement was actually hitting a snag because they're saying on there that the those who were to benefit from the uh

1485
01:50:16,921 --> 01:50:19,223
[SPEAKER_09]: That class that they're referring to actually isn't there.

1486
01:50:20,604 --> 01:50:24,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Because not everybody knew about it until something came out on the internet.

1487
01:50:25,248 --> 01:50:26,229
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll link this in the chat room.

1488
01:50:26,729 --> 01:50:27,710
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an interesting little article.

1489
01:50:29,271 --> 01:50:38,579
[SPEAKER_09]: For anyone who's interested, just go to... It's actually on the New York Times blog where I linked it to me in the technology section.

1490
01:50:39,059 --> 01:50:42,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Just look up Settlement Over Sex Scenes in Grand Theft Auto Hits a Snag.

1491
01:50:44,543 --> 01:50:45,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll link it in the chat room.

1492
01:50:46,045 --> 01:50:46,365
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1493
01:50:47,466 --> 01:50:53,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Alright.

1494
01:50:53,187 --> 01:50:54,547
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dot com.

1495
01:50:56,068 --> 01:51:00,008
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a couple more news articles for you guys, and then we're going to be opening up the Skype line.

1496
01:51:00,028 --> 01:51:02,629
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1497
01:51:03,889 --> 01:51:04,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1498
01:51:04,329 --> 01:51:05,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just coincidence.

1499
01:51:05,589 --> 01:51:13,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's only fair since Rock Band's getting really awesome peripherals from a third-party company, that Guitar Hero World Tour gets...

1500
01:51:14,787 --> 01:51:16,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome peripherals from a third-party company.

1501
01:51:17,552 --> 01:51:28,890
[SPEAKER_13]: The third-party company providing these would be Logitech, and of course they already make the USB microphones that are used by almost all of the music games out there right now.

1502
01:51:30,367 --> 01:51:36,113
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to be doing some high-end guitars and drum sets as well.

1503
01:51:36,253 --> 01:51:47,246
[SPEAKER_13]: No word exactly what features these will have, but if it's Logitech, you can probably guess it's going to be put together at least pretty well.

1504
01:51:47,406 --> 01:51:50,830
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we'll just have to wait and see when they show these off.

1505
01:51:54,738 --> 01:51:59,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, more peripherals to put on the Best Buy shelves and other gaming stores to take up space.

1506
01:51:59,261 --> 01:52:00,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, these things are damn expensive.

1507
01:52:00,862 --> 01:52:06,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if it's anything like that $299 drum set, which I do still want.

1508
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:10,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why, because I don't play Rock Band, but I want it anyways.

1509
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:20,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of music games, I've been kind of brainstorming how I would make a game like Beatmania 2DX work, and I've thought about a game that would combine Beatmania 2DX and poppin' music.

1510
01:52:21,556 --> 01:52:22,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be actually kind of cool.

1511
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish I had a game company to make it for me.

1512
01:52:28,242 --> 01:52:28,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1513
01:52:29,103 --> 01:52:29,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that anyone cares.

1514
01:52:30,623 --> 01:52:31,964
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jamie's going to care about this one.

1515
01:52:31,984 --> 01:52:34,685
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a news article just for you, DarkSakura.

1516
01:52:35,005 --> 01:52:35,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1517
01:52:35,925 --> 01:52:37,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about Ragnarok Online.

1518
01:52:37,766 --> 01:52:40,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just that, but Ragnarok Online DS.

1519
01:52:41,667 --> 01:52:42,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's the thing.

1520
01:52:42,448 --> 01:52:46,249
[SPEAKER_04]: This was announced quite some time ago, and now we're starting to wonder, is this game ever going to come out?

1521
01:52:46,669 --> 01:52:47,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

1522
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:51,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragnarok Online on the DS, it's not actually going to be an MMO.

1523
01:52:52,111 --> 01:52:53,172
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get to play it with other people.

1524
01:52:53,192 --> 01:52:54,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be.

1525
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:55,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and that kind of makes sense.

1526
01:52:55,513 --> 01:53:02,718
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is going to be a single-player role-playing game that apparently has some online features in it, whatever that means.

1527
01:53:03,658 --> 01:53:11,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Some screenshots have come out for the game this week as well, and it does have that same chibi style that you've come to know and love from the original Ragnarok Online.

1528
01:53:11,203 --> 01:53:13,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I looked at the pictures and I saw a bunny band.

1529
01:53:14,385 --> 01:53:16,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently you do have gestural attack inputs.

1530
01:53:16,987 --> 01:53:19,569
[SPEAKER_04]: You use the stylus to kind of draw your attacks and things like that.

1531
01:53:19,849 --> 01:53:22,451
[SPEAKER_04]: December 18th is the day this comes out overseas.

1532
01:53:23,251 --> 01:53:23,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Import!

1533
01:53:24,554 --> 01:53:25,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you will.

1534
01:53:25,394 --> 01:53:25,975
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I will.

1535
01:53:26,895 --> 01:53:27,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you will.

1536
01:53:27,355 --> 01:53:28,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether or not I can read most of it or not.

1537
01:53:29,276 --> 01:53:41,120
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I know will happen right now is that we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and we're going to take a few calls here on this Part B of our show tonight.

1538
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,301
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually kind of jammed through the stories part of our show tonight.

1539
01:53:44,341 --> 01:53:45,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only about 8.15 on the West Coast.

1540
01:53:45,941 --> 01:53:46,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad.

1541
01:53:46,782 --> 01:53:49,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Because here we've got a 10-minute late start tonight.

1542
01:53:49,182 --> 01:53:49,823
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad at all.

1543
01:53:49,943 --> 01:53:51,443
[SPEAKER_09]: For a moment I thought you said on the East Coast.

1544
01:53:51,463 --> 01:53:52,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, wait, what?

1545
01:53:52,323 --> 01:53:53,184
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1546
01:53:53,204 --> 01:53:53,444
[SPEAKER_04]: 8.15 here.

1547
01:53:53,504 --> 01:53:55,945
[SPEAKER_04]: But usually we don't get to the skyline until like 9 o'clock.

1548
01:53:56,065 --> 01:53:57,225
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're doing good tonight.

1549
01:53:57,245 --> 01:54:00,866
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1550
01:54:00,906 --> 01:54:01,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not ringing right now.

1551
01:54:01,867 --> 01:54:03,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, do you have any last- I should start with DarkSakura.

1552
01:54:03,947 --> 01:54:05,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any last-minute stories for us?

1553
01:54:06,908 --> 01:54:07,589
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not really.

1554
01:54:08,269 --> 01:54:08,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki?

1555
01:54:08,429 --> 01:54:08,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki?

1556
01:54:10,161 --> 01:54:13,183
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really been looking at last minute stories.

1557
01:54:13,403 --> 01:54:14,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, here's some.

1558
01:54:14,564 --> 01:54:15,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay.

1559
01:54:15,844 --> 01:54:16,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Sony's Life.

1560
01:54:16,905 --> 01:54:22,348
[SPEAKER_13]: You may remember that as their version of the globe spinning news thing.

1561
01:54:22,448 --> 01:54:24,809
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's not coming out right away.

1562
01:54:25,049 --> 01:54:25,870
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been delayed.

1563
01:54:26,730 --> 01:54:27,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, surprise.

1564
01:54:28,371 --> 01:54:29,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Sony delaying something?

1565
01:54:30,833 --> 01:54:31,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1566
01:54:31,813 --> 01:54:32,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

1567
01:54:32,714 --> 01:54:33,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Rock Band, download content.

1568
01:54:33,895 --> 01:54:38,158
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got some stuff coming out this week, including Crew Fest Pack 2.

1569
01:54:38,738 --> 01:54:44,962
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to be getting with that Face Down in the Dirt by Motley Crue for 80 points or a dollar.

1570
01:54:45,883 --> 01:54:49,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Rescue Me by Buckcherry, another 80 points or a dollar.

1571
01:54:49,525 --> 01:54:51,987
[SPEAKER_13]: And Life is Beautiful by 6AM.

1572
01:54:52,767 --> 01:54:54,409
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's also 80 points or a dollar.

1573
01:54:54,509 --> 01:54:55,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Whole Pack for $2.40 or $3.

1574
01:54:56,990 --> 01:55:14,133
[SPEAKER_13]: and then each they're going to have individual songs for BYOB from System of a Down for two bucks and Toxicity from System of a Down also two bucks and you remember those were part of the System of a Down exclusive download content for when you bought their album so that's kind of interesting

1575
01:55:15,394 --> 01:55:17,415
[SPEAKER_13]: LastGuy.jp

1576
01:55:47,711 --> 01:55:49,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Skyline's open and no one's calling.

1577
01:55:49,112 --> 01:55:49,612
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.

1578
01:55:49,872 --> 01:55:51,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I just checked it to make sure it works.

1579
01:55:51,392 --> 01:55:53,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I call 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1580
01:55:53,653 --> 01:55:56,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it happens sometimes.

1581
01:55:56,895 --> 01:56:03,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I was supposed to be looking up stories, but I was working on trying to get the Wiimotes to work with that Love is Blind game.

1582
01:56:04,198 --> 01:56:05,898
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the one that makes the sex noises.

1583
01:56:07,799 --> 01:56:10,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently my Bluetooth adapter says, Fuck you, Wiimote.

1584
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:11,721
[SPEAKER_13]: I ain't working with you, bitch.

1585
01:56:12,581 --> 01:56:14,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we get to play the chat.

1586
01:56:15,782 --> 01:56:16,462
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we can.

1587
01:56:17,062 --> 01:56:18,363
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a keyboard version, too.

1588
01:56:18,663 --> 01:56:19,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, hooray.

1589
01:56:19,363 --> 01:56:23,124
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a little bonus thing after the show, right?

1590
01:56:23,164 --> 01:56:24,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1591
01:56:24,424 --> 01:56:30,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I found, by accident, a funny MMO that's all about getting laid and partying.

1592
01:56:32,045 --> 01:56:32,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1593
01:56:32,905 --> 01:56:35,746
[SPEAKER_09]: It's some sort of social networking thing, but I thought it was hilarious.

1594
01:56:35,786 --> 01:56:36,946
[SPEAKER_09]: It was called Red Light Center.

1595
01:56:37,666 --> 01:56:38,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I just thought it was funny.

1596
01:56:39,927 --> 01:56:42,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I'm going to play it, but I think it was funny.

1597
01:56:46,945 --> 01:56:47,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

1598
01:56:47,685 --> 01:56:56,687
[SPEAKER_13]: The only other story I had was Ubisoft localizing Armored Core 4 Answer for the US, and it should be coming out in September, and that's kind of cool, I guess.

1599
01:56:56,787 --> 01:56:59,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by Armored Core 4.

1600
01:57:00,168 --> 01:57:01,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I'll pick this up.

1601
01:57:02,148 --> 01:57:05,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably not, but I don't know.

1602
01:57:05,449 --> 01:57:06,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't get too excited anymore.

1603
01:57:06,569 --> 01:57:07,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to love Armored Core games.

1604
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:09,690
[SPEAKER_13]: You just buy every single one that came out, but

1605
01:57:11,519 --> 01:57:11,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh well.

1606
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:16,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I guess I did miss a game that was supposed to be coming out on the Wii and DS this week.

1607
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:17,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Little League World Series 2008.

1608
01:57:19,001 --> 01:57:19,701
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, sad.

1609
01:57:20,381 --> 01:57:24,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and this week on Xbox Live Arcade, we've got Braid for like 15 bucks.

1610
01:57:25,062 --> 01:57:26,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that game supposed to be cool?

1611
01:57:26,042 --> 01:57:26,943
[SPEAKER_13]: It looked kind of neat from the previews.

1612
01:57:26,963 --> 01:57:27,583
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supposed to be pretty cool.

1613
01:57:27,603 --> 01:57:32,444
[SPEAKER_13]: You can kind of like, imagine like a 2D platform game with the Sands of Time built into it.

1614
01:57:33,864 --> 01:57:34,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, our phone's ringing.

1615
01:57:35,805 --> 01:57:36,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1616
01:57:36,745 --> 01:57:37,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1617
01:57:38,032 --> 01:57:40,473
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1618
01:58:08,044 --> 01:58:09,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, did you like the pictures I sent?

1619
01:58:09,465 --> 01:58:11,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they were really hard to see on my phone.

1620
01:58:11,586 --> 01:58:15,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked the, was it, you sent me Knights or Riala, one of them.

1621
01:58:15,768 --> 01:58:16,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I sent you both.

1622
01:58:16,949 --> 01:58:19,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a Frankenfurter one.

1623
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:19,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1624
01:58:20,111 --> 01:58:21,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, I see, Scott, I see.

1625
01:58:21,992 --> 01:58:23,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I also got a Bubble Bobble.

1626
01:58:23,593 --> 01:58:24,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart.

1627
01:58:24,613 --> 01:58:25,154
[SPEAKER_03]: One, there you go.

1628
01:58:25,274 --> 01:58:25,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart.

1629
01:58:25,794 --> 01:58:28,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, I heart NY, there you have it.

1630
01:58:29,076 --> 01:58:31,377
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so how was the con?

1631
01:58:31,417 --> 01:58:32,378
[SPEAKER_04]: What con was it you went to?

1632
01:58:32,398 --> 01:58:33,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called what?

1633
01:58:33,998 --> 01:58:34,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Kineticon.

1634
01:58:34,779 --> 01:58:35,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Kineticon.

1635
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:36,520
[SPEAKER_12]: How was that?

1636
01:58:38,075 --> 01:58:39,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Much better than I thought it was.

1637
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:43,305
[SPEAKER_12]: It gave me a Fanime feel to it, so you know what that means.

1638
01:58:43,345 --> 01:58:45,268
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be going back to that convention next year.

1639
01:58:45,989 --> 01:58:47,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, Fanime's a good time.

1640
01:58:47,532 --> 01:58:48,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Fanime's a great con artist.

1641
01:58:52,838 --> 01:58:56,900
[SPEAKER_12]: I got there like late Friday night because I had to work and I missed my bus.

1642
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:58,561
[SPEAKER_12]: But I got there Saturday.

1643
01:58:58,641 --> 01:58:59,762
[SPEAKER_12]: I left my camera.

1644
01:58:59,802 --> 01:59:01,042
[SPEAKER_12]: It showed up about an hour later.

1645
01:59:01,642 --> 01:59:06,345
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't as packed, but it was just like really roomy, really flowing.

1646
01:59:06,525 --> 01:59:10,927
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when I got to the room, my roommate tells me, oh, there's going to be furries here.

1647
01:59:11,127 --> 01:59:11,327
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1648
01:59:13,208 --> 01:59:14,789
[SPEAKER_12]: That was exactly my reaction.

1649
01:59:16,469 --> 01:59:19,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct me if I'm wrong, Ranma, but did you not say that you missed the bus?

1650
01:59:21,195 --> 01:59:22,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, good Friday.

1651
01:59:22,196 --> 01:59:22,877
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed the bus.

1652
01:59:22,897 --> 01:59:30,605
[SPEAKER_12]: I was stuck waiting at Greyhound for about almost an hour to get my ticket changed.

1653
01:59:31,325 --> 01:59:32,887
[SPEAKER_12]: I see what you did there, sir.

1654
01:59:36,871 --> 01:59:37,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't help it.

1655
01:59:37,492 --> 01:59:37,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1656
01:59:37,972 --> 01:59:39,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's probably not funny.

1657
01:59:39,654 --> 01:59:41,376
[SPEAKER_04]: But in years, you'll look back and laugh at it.

1658
01:59:42,497 --> 01:59:43,638
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all good, man.

1659
01:59:43,698 --> 01:59:44,399
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all good.

1660
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have to ask, what gaming things were going on at the convention?

1661
01:59:53,244 --> 01:59:55,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you believe I saw DDR?

1662
01:59:55,885 --> 01:59:57,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my, at an anime convention?

1663
01:59:57,346 --> 01:59:58,487
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR you don't say.

1664
01:59:59,327 --> 02:00:02,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me guess, was there Smash Brothers?

1665
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:04,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes there was.

1666
02:00:05,971 --> 02:00:06,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be damned.

1667
02:00:07,612 --> 02:00:08,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

1668
02:00:09,013 --> 02:00:10,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there Guitar Hero?

1669
02:00:10,554 --> 02:00:10,594
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1670
02:00:12,013 --> 02:00:13,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on a fucking roll.

1671
02:00:13,094 --> 02:00:13,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.

1672
02:00:13,554 --> 02:00:16,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like the psychic con man.

1673
02:00:16,136 --> 02:00:18,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there a Naruto game?

1674
02:00:21,139 --> 02:00:23,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, not in the dealer's room.

1675
02:00:23,761 --> 02:00:27,963
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the gaming dealers was showing off one of the Naruto games for PlayStation 2.

1676
02:00:28,203 --> 02:00:29,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on, hold on.

1677
02:00:29,304 --> 02:00:30,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Psychic con man.

1678
02:00:30,845 --> 02:00:31,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

1679
02:00:33,487 --> 02:00:39,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there a woman overweight dressed as Sailor Moon?

1680
02:00:41,949 --> 02:00:46,392
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1681
02:01:14,013 --> 02:01:16,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there an overweight man dressed as Sailor Moon?

1682
02:01:18,206 --> 02:01:21,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually know, believe it or not, there really wasn't any overweight people.

1683
02:01:21,847 --> 02:01:25,348
[SPEAKER_12]: There was, but most of them were wearing Lolita outfits and long corsets.

1684
02:01:25,668 --> 02:01:34,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Because KineticCon is a combination of a majority of a webcomic convention with anime, sci-fi, fantasy.

1685
02:01:34,951 --> 02:01:38,493
[SPEAKER_12]: I forget his name, but the guy that played Neelix on Voyager was there.

1686
02:01:39,833 --> 02:01:41,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Ethan something, isn't his name?

1687
02:01:42,634 --> 02:01:44,094
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't get me his autograph, did you?

1688
02:01:45,235 --> 02:01:45,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I had no money.

1689
02:01:48,487 --> 02:01:50,648
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even know he was here until I showed up Saturday.

1690
02:01:51,409 --> 02:01:52,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I forgive you.

1691
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:56,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm getting you Amino's autograph.

1692
02:01:56,612 --> 02:01:58,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that should be something.

1693
02:01:58,813 --> 02:01:59,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I found my book.

1694
02:01:59,494 --> 02:02:00,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, I found my book.

1695
02:02:01,355 --> 02:02:01,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Woot.

1696
02:02:02,095 --> 02:02:04,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, DJ Ratchet, there was anime.

1697
02:02:04,337 --> 02:02:05,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Tons of it.

1698
02:02:05,257 --> 02:02:06,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be sending you my book.

1699
02:02:06,598 --> 02:02:08,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, okay?

1700
02:02:09,019 --> 02:02:09,380
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

1701
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:09,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1702
02:02:11,206 --> 02:02:11,906
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1703
02:02:13,047 --> 02:02:15,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Something tells me the callers are fairly apathetic tonight.

1704
02:02:15,167 --> 02:02:16,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ethan Phillips.

1705
02:02:17,008 --> 02:02:17,488
[SPEAKER_04]: That's his name.

1706
02:02:17,808 --> 02:02:18,209
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one.

1707
02:02:18,389 --> 02:02:18,829
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1708
02:02:18,849 --> 02:02:21,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuvok is from Sacramento.

1709
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:24,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen him, but I see stories about him on the local news once in a while.

1710
02:02:24,611 --> 02:02:26,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Celebrity Tim something.

1711
02:02:26,992 --> 02:02:27,552
[SPEAKER_04]: What's his name?

1712
02:02:28,592 --> 02:02:29,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim something?

1713
02:02:30,213 --> 02:02:31,393
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is Tuvok's name?

1714
02:02:31,433 --> 02:02:31,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1715
02:02:32,594 --> 02:02:32,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

1716
02:02:33,134 --> 02:02:33,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones.

1717
02:02:33,774 --> 02:02:34,294
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another call.

1718
02:02:34,334 --> 02:02:35,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1719
02:02:35,195 --> 02:02:35,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1720
02:02:36,809 --> 02:02:37,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, we got through.

1721
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:38,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we did.

1722
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:41,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, we've got like a party chat on the line.

1723
02:02:41,812 --> 02:02:42,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Introduce yourselves.

1724
02:02:44,393 --> 02:02:46,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this isn't like a party line from like the 80s or something?

1725
02:02:47,295 --> 02:02:48,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1726
02:02:48,495 --> 02:02:49,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It's party chat.

1727
02:02:50,756 --> 02:02:52,477
[SPEAKER_04]: We should meet up at Chuck E. Cheese afterwards.

1728
02:02:52,617 --> 02:02:53,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's on the line?

1729
02:02:55,499 --> 02:02:59,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Toshin, FootyMonster, JackRansom, and TheRobD.

1730
02:02:59,501 --> 02:03:01,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, it's like an all-games party line.

1731
02:03:02,469 --> 02:03:03,190
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a party line.

1732
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:06,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1733
02:03:06,313 --> 02:03:07,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Call 1-900.

1734
02:03:07,074 --> 02:03:07,514
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-900.

1735
02:03:07,574 --> 02:03:08,455
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always a party.

1736
02:03:08,596 --> 02:03:09,336
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the way it rolls.

1737
02:03:10,097 --> 02:03:11,418
[SPEAKER_04]: To what do we owe this phone call tonight?

1738
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:15,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say I beat your deadline score on Geometry Wars and you're going down.

1739
02:03:16,143 --> 02:03:16,544
[SPEAKER_02]: F you.

1740
02:03:17,165 --> 02:03:17,485
[SPEAKER_02]: F you.

1741
02:03:19,427 --> 02:03:20,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did it like five seconds ago.

1742
02:03:20,989 --> 02:03:23,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Geometry Wars brings out the most competitive in all of us, doesn't it?

1743
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:27,941
[SPEAKER_02]: How about my pacifism score?

1744
02:03:28,422 --> 02:03:32,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I played pacifism for an hour trying to get that stupid wax off achievement.

1745
02:03:32,165 --> 02:03:33,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you beat my pacifism score?

1746
02:03:35,087 --> 02:03:35,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

1747
02:03:36,709 --> 02:03:38,090
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I'm still cool at something.

1748
02:03:39,619 --> 02:03:40,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1749
02:04:01,047 --> 02:04:01,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so crazy.

1750
02:04:02,388 --> 02:04:03,429
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't pause the game at all.

1751
02:04:03,469 --> 02:04:06,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Just while you're playing it, hit the right bumper, not the trigger, but the bumper.

1752
02:04:06,351 --> 02:04:09,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit right bumper and the back button, and you can render the field in 3D.

1753
02:04:09,814 --> 02:04:10,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so cool.

1754
02:04:11,436 --> 02:04:16,219
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you touch the dot in the room with the dragon ducks, then you can see created by Warren Robinette, and it's awesome.

1755
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:19,322
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like that.

1756
02:04:20,063 --> 02:04:22,024
[SPEAKER_02]: But in 3D, dude.

1757
02:04:22,044 --> 02:04:22,284
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D.

1758
02:04:23,926 --> 02:04:25,427
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you go back?

1759
02:04:25,767 --> 02:04:27,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now it's in the middle of my game.

1760
02:04:27,629 --> 02:04:28,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit right bumper and back again.

1761
02:04:30,026 --> 02:04:31,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Geometry Wars Geometry Wars Geometry Wars

1762
02:04:54,406 --> 02:04:55,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm totally screwed.

1763
02:04:55,227 --> 02:04:55,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I called Microsoft.

1764
02:04:55,947 --> 02:04:57,628
[SPEAKER_11]: They said, basically, well, fuck you.

1765
02:04:57,688 --> 02:04:58,108
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't care.

1766
02:04:59,709 --> 02:05:01,070
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm out of $500 and a 360.

1767
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:02,131
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome.

1768
02:05:02,831 --> 02:05:03,512
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

1769
02:05:03,732 --> 02:05:05,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That is crappy customer service.

1770
02:05:06,134 --> 02:05:07,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I understand you're an original.

1771
02:05:07,574 --> 02:05:08,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really do business with it.

1772
02:05:08,655 --> 02:05:12,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried messaging through Twitter to Major Nelson to try my luck there.

1773
02:05:12,838 --> 02:05:13,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, nothing happened.

1774
02:05:13,979 --> 02:05:15,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he probably gets 500 emails a day.

1775
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:17,661
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks, though.

1776
02:05:17,941 --> 02:05:23,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say this before I end my part of talking here, because I know you probably have a lot more calls to take.

1777
02:05:23,822 --> 02:05:25,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, not really tonight.

1778
02:05:25,783 --> 02:05:30,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Rhythm Heaven or Rhythm Tengoku Gold on the DS, you guys need to play that.

1779
02:05:30,904 --> 02:05:36,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a lot of Rhythm fans in the audience, Rhythm game fans.

1780
02:05:36,805 --> 02:05:37,505
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to play that.

1781
02:05:37,545 --> 02:05:42,386
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the WarioWare game of Rhythm games, and it's so fun.

1782
02:05:42,746 --> 02:05:45,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us really quickly, is that what the game's like, WarioWare?

1783
02:05:47,448 --> 02:05:53,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, imagine each stage, four or five mini-games per stage, with a final stage being a remix.

1784
02:05:54,253 --> 02:05:58,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Each game is totally different in gameplay, and it's a small song, or a small thingy.

1785
02:05:59,296 --> 02:06:06,220
[SPEAKER_11]: And from that, you advance the remix stage, and in the remix you play all those mini-games crumpled together into one cohesive song.

1786
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:08,782
[SPEAKER_11]: So you gotta switch gameplays on the fly all the time.

1787
02:06:09,482 --> 02:06:12,203
[SPEAKER_11]: and it goes like that for many, many levels and it's so fun.

1788
02:06:12,404 --> 02:06:17,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Great music, really catchy, the action on the cellos works perfectly and it's so fun.

1789
02:06:18,506 --> 02:06:18,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1790
02:06:19,287 --> 02:06:20,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds pretty cool.

1791
02:06:21,327 --> 02:06:34,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just been playing an old copy of Super Robot Wars Alpha I got from a friend a while ago since I'll be going to Otakon next week to see Jam Project and actually I'm going to meet up with Rama probably.

1792
02:06:34,953 --> 02:06:38,175
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Dark Knight was too lame to go even though Rama and I offered to pay his way

1793
02:06:40,212 --> 02:06:48,420
[SPEAKER_02]: What about games you've been playing, JackRansom?

1794
02:06:50,222 --> 02:06:56,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my PSP miraculously, after a year and a half, fixed itself this weekend, so I decided I'd go out and pick up Patapon.

1795
02:06:57,868 --> 02:07:24,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Pata, Pata, Pata, Pawn Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom That game is nuts It's freaking nuts and I absolutely love it I forgot how many god damn great games there were on the PSP You start hearing those little drum beats in your sleep if you play that game long enough It's terrible, you're lying there trying to go to sleep Pawn, Pawn, Pata, Pawn Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom I cannot wait to get to that stage because at the moment I need more of that game, I want more of that game I'm loving it

1796
02:07:25,731 --> 02:07:27,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray for PSP getting a lot of good games lately.

1797
02:07:28,075 --> 02:07:28,496
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1798
02:07:28,576 --> 02:07:30,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, go ahead, Toshin, real quick.

1799
02:07:33,860 --> 02:07:35,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I said Summer of Arcade for Xbox Live.

1800
02:07:36,041 --> 02:07:36,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be broke.

1801
02:07:37,501 --> 02:07:38,221
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm saying.

1802
02:07:38,241 --> 02:07:38,881
[SPEAKER_02]: For real.

1803
02:07:39,061 --> 02:07:40,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that Braid game.

1804
02:07:40,222 --> 02:07:42,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to check out the demo first because I haven't heard much about it.

1805
02:07:43,123 --> 02:07:44,643
[SPEAKER_04]: But the rest of it looks great.

1806
02:07:45,043 --> 02:07:45,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1807
02:07:45,223 --> 02:07:46,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be broke.

1808
02:07:46,664 --> 02:07:48,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, Galaga Legions the next.

1809
02:07:49,144 --> 02:07:50,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I need money.

1810
02:07:50,745 --> 02:07:51,185
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what though?

1811
02:07:51,225 --> 02:07:53,605
[SPEAKER_04]: If you add it all up, it's the price of Soul Calibur 4.

1812
02:07:53,826 --> 02:07:54,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So honestly, it's...

1813
02:07:56,513 --> 02:07:57,533
[SPEAKER_02]: That also kicks ass.

1814
02:07:57,914 --> 02:07:59,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend that for all the Soul Calibur fans.

1815
02:07:59,614 --> 02:08:01,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD coming.

1816
02:08:02,556 --> 02:08:02,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

1817
02:08:03,496 --> 02:08:03,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully soon.

1818
02:08:04,177 --> 02:08:06,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Toshin, we need to play custom characters in Soul Calibur 4.

1819
02:08:06,958 --> 02:08:07,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon.

1820
02:08:07,858 --> 02:08:08,939
[SPEAKER_04]: You going to be around later?

1821
02:08:08,959 --> 02:08:09,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm around.

1822
02:08:09,999 --> 02:08:10,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I might.

1823
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a wow date after the show, but maybe later.

1824
02:08:14,061 --> 02:08:14,422
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk.

1825
02:08:14,662 --> 02:08:14,902
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1826
02:08:15,162 --> 02:08:15,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, guys.

1827
02:08:15,642 --> 02:08:16,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to let you go.

1828
02:08:16,162 --> 02:08:16,883
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to wrap up the show.

1829
02:08:16,943 --> 02:08:17,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, though.

1830
02:08:18,123 --> 02:08:18,464
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:08:18,484 --> 02:08:18,804

[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch.
