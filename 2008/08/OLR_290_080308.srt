00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture and the gamer lifestyle

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Roar, roar, beware I hunger

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No I'm not hunger

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm full of tasty epic salad

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So then we should not beware

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We should beware

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Beware of what?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Angst?

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
See it's even worse if I don't tell you what to beware of because then you're just like extra

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I see then you're scary, you're like Silent Hill scary

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Alright say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hello

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How you doing, Loki?

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Good

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Alright and I see you're drinking a milkshake right now

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes it's one of those diet milkshakes from Jack in the Box

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wait it's a diet milkshake?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You know the milkshake diet, what they're not all like that?

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No I don't think a milkshake is a part of a good diet so

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Actually milkshakes can be very good for you if you do them right

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well I doubt Jack in the Box does them the healthy way, call it a hunch

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Make them with no sugar added ice cream and protein powder and low fat milk

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Then it's only half bad

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's very healthy, give good dairy

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I just finished my nutrition class

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Orange Lounge Foodio everybody, welcome to it

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Anyhow let's talk about games and we always start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
First though let me introduce the one and only chat room

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com is the place to be if you're listening live on this Sunday evening August 3rd of 2008

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
For our 290th show if you can believe it

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio kind of back in the spotlight

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll talk a little bit about that as we move on

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But first we gotta talk about our gaming weeks, the types of games you've been playing

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Dark soccer as always, start us off

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We have Soul Calibur IV now

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And I'm going to sit down and make characters tomorrow

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I haven't had a chance to actually play it yet but we have it

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Have you been watching it at all?

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ready? Yes?

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Rob, this has been the last week of class

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's a fair question, yes or no?

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No, this has been the last week of class for me so I actually took my final on Saturday morning and then played

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I took a hooky day though

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What did you do with hooky day?

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Watched movies

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But you didn't play Soul Calibur fail

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No I didn't

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm just kidding

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But but but but but I did play some Portal

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And how was that?

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Portal-rific!

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Alright

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And of course Ragnarok

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ragnarok

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have a story just for you later tonight

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I downloaded a game for my phone, I downloaded a Sudoku game

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I've been playing Sudoku on my phone

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why?

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How bored have you been on a scale of one to ten?

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's actually kind of fun

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Keep in mind you can only use each number once

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's actually kind of fun

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Just for something when you've got three minutes to kill and

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sudoku is a huge time waster

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But like that's it, it's a time waster

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you're looking to waste time you know at least try to put your brain to work right?

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I guess that's what most any game's for right?

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Alright

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well what about the show?

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hey wait a minute

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Alright

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Is that it for your gaming week?

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes Rob

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tech Master Loki, how was your gaming week?

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Um

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I didn't play any of my games this week actually

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I only played Grand Theft Auto IV

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I meant to play a bunch of stuff this week but never got around to it

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Grand Theft Auto IV and um

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The Shit Game but we'll talk about that later

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The Shit Game huh?

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now this isn't a game that is just shitty

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's actually The Shit Game

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The Shit Game

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is it The Shit?

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No it's Shitty

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But it's so fun

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Alright

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's so much fun

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I wish it was longer

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alright

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well god I feel like I'm the only one that's actually played a lot of games this week

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I have played quite a few games

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I played Soul Calibur IV on the Xbox 360

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Ran out and bought it the day it came out

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't have a Playstation 3 so I had to get it on Xbox 360

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm really enjoying the game

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm having a lot of fun with it especially in single player mode

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I love create a character mode

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Granted I had fun with it in Soul Calibur III

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But I don't know I like in this one getting to kind of edit the characters that are already there

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Getting to you know make characters based off of the existing fighting styles

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because I'll tell you what it's really funny to have this chick with a giant afro

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Doing Young Sung's move where she does the splits and everything

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's really funny to me

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The only thing that kind of stinks is that you can't have the bonus characters

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yoda and Starkiller you can't use them or the apprentice as he's called in the game

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Which makes them sound like a Donald Trump flunky

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But Starkiller from The Force Unleashed

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You can't customize characters based off of them which sucks

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Because I would have loved to have made a

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can understand Yoda

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Because you know it's kind of hard to base characters off Yoda

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Unless you're going to have midget fighters

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Which would be an awesome fighting game by the way

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I was just thinking that you should totally make your Final Fantasy XI character

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Lil' Kim in Soul Calibur

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I could but only if I could do Yoda because she was very tiny

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's what I was going to say

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I mean if you could do the midget size

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well I made Sassy Pants my Warcraft character

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I made her based off of Young Sung

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
She's the chick with the giant afro and she's quite sassy

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And very cool

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And I also made a male guy based off of

138
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He kind of looks like Robin from the old school

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Because he has the little mask and very vibrant colors

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But he's based off of Tyra

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Who's the hula hoop girl

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But I gave him a very very manly voice

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So as he's like dancing around with the little hula hoop thing

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's like

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can kiss my ass

146
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Things like that or whatever he's saying

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's really funny

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I love customization modes, it's great

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's the only reason why I would play wrestling games

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
To make my own character

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So it's great

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I had a lot of fun with customization

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And online mode plays like fun

154
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I played DMN from understation live

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
On Saturday nights at all games radio

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I was playing DMN one night

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I played him as Sassy Pants

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Because you can use your custom characters online

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's so great

160
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What the hell is this

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Of course he was Yoda

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Because everybody online is playing Yoda

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He's like what the hell

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So it was fun

165
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And for the record, I beat his ass

166
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But no, we had a lot of fun playing Soul Calibur

167
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Here's the things I don't like about Soul Calibur

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I actually like the Star Wars characters

169
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know why people are so like

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Uh, they throw things off balance

171
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I've never been that hardcore into Soul Calibur

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So I don't study the game mechanics or the science

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think it's fun

174
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Deal, I especially think

175
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Starkiller is a great, great character

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I love playing as him

177
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So he's awesome to get in the game

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
By the way, if you want to unlock him

179
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You have to beat arcade mode with Yoda

180
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Or I imagine Vader on the 360

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So there you have it

182
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I think he's a great addition

183
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
On the PS3

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So I like playing as him

185
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I like the new characters

186
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What I don't like, I don't like the single player modes

187
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Story mode is very, very short

188
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It doesn't need to go on forever

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But climbing the tower up and down mode

190
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Which is basically just an excuse

191
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
To fight

192
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Like five people all at once

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In a row

194
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And unlock things that you have no idea

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What the conditions are to unlock them

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Until you actually do it

197
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Then it'll go, oh, you made it through a whole match without getting hit

198
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That was the surprise, to unlock something

199
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Ta-da, you get a new bra for using

200
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Custom character mode

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I mean, that's literally what it is

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I am hearing, and I do see it a little bit

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That some of the game mechanics

204
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Of some of the old characters

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Kind of got screwed up a little bit

206
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Like for instance, Shaoran

207
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Says Talim got slightly less hot

208
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Between two and three

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And she plays a little different too

210
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And Ivy, I noticed especially, plays different

211
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's hard to explain

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But some characters I still have a lot of fun with

213
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I want to make a character

214
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I love him, he's awesome

215
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I want to make one that's more foul than Voldo

216
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Here's the other interesting thing about the Soul Calibur

217
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The online content

218
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Some of it is available and you can download

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
For just 100 Microsoft points

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can get some extra customization

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Which is basically like old

222
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Costumes

223
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And the cool thing is you can actually customize the existing characters

224
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Like change the colors of their outfits and stuff

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So that's kind of neat

226
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It is pay to unlock content though

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Because it's only like 100 kilobytes

228
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But it's only 100 points, that's not the end of the world

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But here's what I thought was a little weird

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You can also download extra

231
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Songs for use in stages

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
From the old Soul Calibur games

233
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So pretty much there's 12 songs

234
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
From the old Soul Calibur games all available

235
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
At 100 points a pop

236
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Practically, or maybe even it was like 120

237
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But you can get the pack of all of them for like 1200

238
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I apologize if I'm misappropriating those points

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But I think it was 80 points per song

240
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But you can get, maybe it was more like 16 or something

241
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Because you can get it for like 1200 points

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can get them all

243
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Which I think is a little silly

244
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You know, why not

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Xbox supports custom soundtracks

246
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why don't I like get the Soul Calibur soundtrack

247
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Through methods online

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Burn it to a CD, rip it to my Xbox

249
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Ta-da! Custom soundtracks of the old music

250
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So, a little bit weak

251
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So, yeah

252
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The cons would be single player mode

253
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But the pros would be customization

254
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I think the Star Wars characters are a good thing

255
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Despite what people say

256
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They're not, they're just like

257
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Link being in Soul Calibur 2 on the GameCube and Spawn

258
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There's something different

259
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You don't have to play with them

260
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But expect to see a lot of them online

261
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And online mode is nice

262
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Other games I've been playing this week

263
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2

264
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
On the Xbox 360

265
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Which I would say

266
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Is the best game on Xbox Live Arcade right now

267
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I think it's great

268
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And it's a

269
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Even though they upped the price from $5 to $10

270
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I think it's a heck of a deal

271
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Because you get the six different modes in the game

272
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Pacifism mode

273
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So much, like, that mode is fun

274
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And it's weird because you don't even shoot

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
In that mode, you just fly around the screen

276
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Dodging enemies

277
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But it's so disgustingly simple

278
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Like the old Atari 2600 games

279
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And the old 80's games

280
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That was just, you know, shoot things

281
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't get hit, that's it, it's so simple

282
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's one of the reasons I think I love Geometry Wars

283
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Is it really kind of

284
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Kind of, I don't know, kind of

285
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Recalls those days of the past

286
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
These very simple video games

287
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And you practically have like six different games in a way

288
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Kind of in there

289
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And I really like the way they've incorporated the leaderboard into the game

290
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They've basically made the game all about

291
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Beating your friends

292
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The achievements are interesting

293
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They're a lot easier to get than they were in Geometry Wars 1

294
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But like, you know, for instance

295
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There's these two achievements, Wax On and Wax Off

296
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And you do it in Pacifism mode

297
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And the Wax On is

298
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Circling around the screen

299
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Touching every wall

300
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But as you start to do it

301
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Then the game realizes you're going through the achievement

302
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And it starts lighting up the wall

303
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
On how much of it you've circled

304
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And then Wax Off is doing the same thing twice

305
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Which is kind of hard to do when Pacifism mode

306
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Gets going

307
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So I was pretty impressed by how they

308
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Kind of worked in the achievements

309
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I like that they made it very competitive with a friend's leaderboard

310
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And I got to try multiplayer

311
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Which sadly is not on

312
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Xbox Live because we all know that's what they're going to do

313
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
For Retro Evolve 3, I'm sure

314
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
To make that fresh

315
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But with Retro Evolve 2 you can play at least in the same house

316
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Multiplayer, which is a surprising amount of fun

317
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Again, if you like old classic arcade games

318
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
With excellent graphics

319
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think the graphics are so great

320
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
They're really a step up from

321
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Geometry Wars 1

322
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Where it really has that kind of

323
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Neon glow to the graphics

324
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It really looks like you're playing a freaking

325
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Vetrex or something

326
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I think it's great

327
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I highly recommend Geometry Wars 2

328
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If you even like shooters in the slightest

329
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's a great deal at $10

330
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I know the price went up, but you get six different games now

331
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's worth it

332
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Check it out, highly, highly recommend

333
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Besides Final Fantasy 4

334
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And Warcraft and the usual affair

335
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's pretty much it for my gaming week

336
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But those two are the new, new games I've been playing

337
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Looking at comments in the chat room

338
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
GS68 says

339
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Geometry Wars Retro Evolve 2 sequence mode

340
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Is reminding me of GigaWing

341
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Son of Dad says GigaWing should be

342
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
On Xbox Live Arcade along with Mars Matrix

343
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
As if

344
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There weren't enough shooters on Xbox Live Arcade

345
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Mars Matrix was a cool game though

346
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know much about that, you're going to have to

347
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I've got it somewhere

348
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll have to hook up the Dreamcast

349
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Alright, you'll have to do that

350
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Anyhow, let's talk about a little bit

351
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Of housekeeping tonight

352
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
First off in housekeeping

353
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It is All Games Listener Appreciation

354
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Month

355
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
During All Games Listener Appreciation Month

356
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We're going to be giving away free shit

357
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
To our listeners, here's the thing

358
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're going to win tokens this month

359
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That will allow you to basically

360
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Kind of enter a larger contest

361
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Going on at AllGames.com

362
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Where you can win prizes, they're talking about giving away

363
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Like game systems and games

364
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's huge, all you have to do is listen

365
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We're going to be giving away three tokens redeemable

366
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
For various prizes, we'll have more details

367
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
On that next week, but definitely stay tuned

368
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000

Sadly

376
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We will not be live in two weeks

377
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Since this is housekeeping, there will be

378
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No live show, Sunday

379
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
August 17th, this is the first time actually

380
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The folks in the studio are hearing about this too

381
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Surprise, Loki

382
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I heard about it earlier

383
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's because I was

384
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Looking to win, but Loki ran through the door

385
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
At the last minute and I neglected to tell him

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Last minute, but like a half an hour

387
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I forgot, I forgot

388
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Here's the thing

389
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't talk about my personal life too much

390
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But this is too funny to pass up

391
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I've been seeing William for a year and a half now

392
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The thing about William and I is that we're both

393
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Really big nerds

394
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We actually spent our first anniversary

395
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We actually drove down to Long Beach and went to the

396
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Star Trek tour at the Queen Mary

397
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's how big nerds we are

398
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Well here's the thing, we've always talked about

399
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
How we're going to go to the Star Trek experience

400
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Because I haven't been since I was like 20

401
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Like right before I started working at my

402
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Current job, so it was about 7 years ago

403
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So it was a long time ago when I was last at the

404
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Star Trek experience, and we keep talking about how

405
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We're going to go back, we're going to go back because I've never ridden the Borg

406
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
4D ride, well then I read

407
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
On the internet last night

408
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They are shutting down the Star Trek experience

409
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
On September 1st, which is so

410
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Sad, like, I don't know

411
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why they would shut that down, it's so cool

412
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So it really lit a fire

413
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Under our ass to go to the Star Trek

414
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Experience before it closes, but because

415
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Of Penny Arcade Expo, because of

416
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Some other commitment I have in Reno

417
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
In 3 weeks, because of the fact

418
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
There's a huge convention in Vegas next week

419
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It really only made sense

420
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We have to go to Vegas in 2 weeks, so

421
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We booked a trip, and we're going to Vegas in 2 weeks

422
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Very last minute trip

423
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Thank you to the various websites

424
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Online, so yes I am a

425
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Giant nerd going to the Star Trek experience

426
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
In Vegas in 2 weeks, so there will be a live show

427
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We might pre-tape something, I don't know yet

428
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Nerd. So

429
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What? What was

430
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
By the way, for the record folks

431
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The first thing that DarkSakura said

432
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
To me, I want to go

433
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I do

434
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I do not want to go

435
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I haven't seen, I haven't

436
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Been on the Borg ride

437
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Bobby Blackwolf says they're shutting it down because Star Trek

438
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Is irrelevant these days, bite your tongue

439
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's that new movie coming out

440
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's an awful thing to say, you take that back

441
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You take that back Bobby Blackwolf

442
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Alright

443
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So I'll be in Vegas in 2, yeah

444
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Blackwolf says, I actually tried to see if I could

445
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Get to Vegas this month too

446
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because I've never seen the Star Trek experience, ha!

447
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Anyhow

448
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So 2 weeks

449
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And we'll fill you in more on what's going to happen that week

450
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't know if DarkSakura and Loki are going to do a show

451
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Or if we'll pre-tape something or what we're going to do

452
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So we'll see

453
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll just burn things live on air

454
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
For the imagination show

455
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, that'd be great

456
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Or the fuck show, no you can't do the fuck show without me

457
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We can't do the fuck show until we're all here

458
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You can't do it without me

459
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Alright, that's it for pretty much housekeeping

460
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Otherwise, join our MySpace at Orange Launch Radio

461
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Join our Facebook, OL Army, our live journal

462
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Orange Lounge

463
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Where else are we social hoard? Oh, we have a new one

464
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
If you check out the Orange Lounge Radio forums

465
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The OL archive has been built

466
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's this, I don't know

467
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They use SkyDrive

468
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Or some website where you can share

469
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Masses of big files

470
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Because I am a generous, nice, kind, giving person

471
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I actually uploaded

472
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
20 old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio

473
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Old, moldy

474
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Stanky episodes

475
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

476
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Episode 20-40 I think are up there on the OL archive

477
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Along with some other old school

478
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Orange Lounge Radio stuff

479
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm going to warn you in advance

480
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It was a much different show 5 years ago

481
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Be warned, if you're expecting the same stuff

482
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Here now, it's even worse

483
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If you can believe it

484
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So there you have it, the OL archive

485
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
More information available on our forums

486
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Alright, enough whoring ourselves out, let's get to some gaming news

487
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes, this week, Nintendo

488
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Along with 54 other developers

489
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Filed a lawsuit against

490
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't know

491
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
A lawsuit against the makers

492
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Of the R4 device

493
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
As well as, I'm assuming they're going to try to

494
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Expand it

495
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Against all the devices out there

496
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Basically trying to make laws passed now

497
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
To prevent people

498
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
From pirating their games

499
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's funny

500
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah

501
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't you think that'll just make it worse, or what?

502
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Well

503
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes, I actually

504
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Because of the news, I went ahead and bought another one

505
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Just to stick it to it

506
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No, just

507
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Cause my wife wanted one

508
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
She plays puzzle games

509
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And I don't see

510
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't know

511
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, let me read this real fast before we talk a little more about this

512
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Cause this is right in the same line with us

513
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Talking about how, you know, you guys are running off and buying one

514
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And all this

515
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Actually, the word is that the R4

516
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Pricing and the sales of them are

517
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Increasing a lot

518
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
After this whole lawsuit happened

519
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Apparently, in two days time

520
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The price of an R4 at

521
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Some stores in Japan went from

522
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Just under 3,000 yen

523
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
To just under 5,000 yen

524
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
From $28 to $55

525
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Literally overnight

526
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The question is, is maybe that what Nintendo was trying to go for

527
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Driving the price of these up

528
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Due to the fear

529
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't know, that seems a little counterproductive to me

530
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Cause it makes the demand of them go up in a way

531
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't think that's really gonna affect anything

532
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Because people are just buying them really fast

533
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And now they're just figuring, hey, we can cash in on it now

534
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But

535
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I mean, when the demand goes back down, they're just gonna clear out their

536
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Inventory somewhere, and they'll still be sold

537
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You know, somewhere

538
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But, hey, I mean

539
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
At least they're taking notice of this, I guess

540
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
In a way, though, let's get

541
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Devil's advocate Loki, these devices

542
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Can promote piracy

543
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So why should they be allowed on the market?

544
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, because

545
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Guns can kill people, so

546
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You know

547
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's not the gun killing the people

548
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's the people killing the people

549
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
With the guns

550
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's just like, these devices, sure, they can

551
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Allow you to pirate games

552
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But it's the people pirating the games that are actually

553
00:19:37,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Pirating the games

554
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Well, I mean, honestly

555
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't think that they necessarily should be

556
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Allowed

557
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I mean

558
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But people are gonna do it anyway

559
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You know, it's, I look at it as sort of, you know

560
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The whole, like, the whole

561
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Drug trade

562
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I was just saying, as you were saying,

563
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You know, I think

564
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You know, I think

565
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You know, I think

566
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You know, I think

567
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You know, I think

568
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I was just saying, as you were saying

569
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That I'm almost thinking in my mind

570
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Like, marijuana, you know

571
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
A lot of people smoke pot

572
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I personally choose to not smoke pot

573
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's a personal preference

574
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But it's kind of one of those things that even though it's against the law

575
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
A lot of people do it anyway

576
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, that's what my thought would be

577
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That Nintendo talk to the developers

578
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And make multi-packs

579
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Of old games

580
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So that, um

581
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You know, say you buy x number of

582
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
They can market something like that, or even have their own download service for old games like that.

583
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Like virtual consoles?

584
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, I'm talking about for the DS.

585
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Perhaps they're looking at the virtual console and perhaps expanding it to the DS

586
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and going to put a device similar to that to do such a thing anyways,

587
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and they're worried people are going to pirate the virtual console games, which are five to ten bucks a pop.

588
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You know, it's not twenty dollars a pop, but still, that's a lot more games that you can fit on those cartridges

589
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
because those things are a few kilobytes versus 32 megs, 42 megs, and stuff like that.

590
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But that may be something that they're worried about.

591
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Or the fact that they're worried that sales are going to dip a lot, like the PSP, because they blame piracy on that.

592
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I blame bad games, but you know.

593
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But piracy, being able to play old Nintendo games on the PSP kind of drove sales in the beginning.

594
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Jamie, I wanted to let you finish your thought before I go to chat comments.

595
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yes, thank you.

596
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
My whole point is that I honestly do think that Nintendo might be looking to market something like that,

597
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and it doesn't really matter because piracy is illegal, that's the end of the story.

598
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If you use something that is non-proprietary that is not sponsored by Nintendo to play copies of their games,

599
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
it is technically theft.

600
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So, I don't think they're ever going to be okay, but I think Nintendo might be looking for a way to sort of market the idea for their own benefit.

601
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So I can see why they would want to push it.

602
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Although honestly, Nintendo has had the easiest way to pirate or play imports or anything on their systems.

603
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Because in the past it was just a physical lockout, you adjust a tab and boom, you can play your imports on your Super Nintendo.

604
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You know, there were absolutely no lockouts on the old Game Boys.

605
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You can still play imports on the DS and you can buy those multi-game cartridges for dirt cheap.

606
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So really, the whole problem I think is that Nintendo needs to look at how they're actually allowing it, is how I see it.

607
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,000
They've had to have built in some way because they have not been the best at preventing the piracy from going on.

608
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Let's look at some comments from chat at chat.orangelaunchradio.com because it's your show too here at Orange Launch Radio.

609
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We'd like to hear what you guys have to say.

610
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Blake says, it's the law of software, stopping piracy is impossible no matter how hard you try.

611
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
ActDef says, disclaimer, use it for homebrew only as in programs and stuff, don't pirate please.

612
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
To which I think this is kind of a good follow up comment.

613
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Joshi16 says, it would be like banning smoking pipes because you can put illegal drugs in it but you can also put tobacco in them.

614
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So it's kind of like how you choose to use it.

615
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Interesting approach.

616
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I agree with Loki though, I probably wouldn't risk my DS by using one of those.

617
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
If it breaks, I'm screwed.

618
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
MissingNo says, I heart the R4.

619
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's the thing though, it won't hurt your DS at all because it's a device that runs on a cart.

620
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You're not flashing your DS, you're not doing anything to your DS.

621
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
AlphaCananagram says, this is bullshit but if they do take down these devices, they need to leave the homebrew only flash carts alone.

622
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
TigerClaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a homebrew up to listen to internet radio on your DS.

623
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
GameGuru says, well if Nintendo makes their own R4, that would be cool.

624
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I love this name too, the original Snake.

625
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Lieutenant Pliskin says, absolutely okay, sure it makes it possible but there are lots of homebrew and other features.

626
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
People will always find a way to pirate.

627
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I thought this comment was interesting though.

628
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Hitstun says, I guess I still don't understand how piracy is theft.

629
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm not sure if you're being facetious but do keep in mind, you know, people get paid to make games.

630
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Just like people get paid to make movies and paid to write music and what have you.

631
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And when you take it without paying for it, that's less money.

632
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Now granted you get into this whole step, step, step thing about, you know, especially in the record industry.

633
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Well, how much of the money is really going to the artist and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

634
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But, you know, regardless, you are taking money out of the system by copying.

635
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yes, this Dark Knight says, copy kills music.

636
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Remember what Captain Jack always used to say, copy kills music.

637
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Alright, so if you have further comments on this story, mail back at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

638
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Well, in other news, there is an interesting thing in regards to the whole piracy idea.

639
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It was actually stated by David Reeves for Sony Europe that you could download the PS3 films on BitTorrent while you're waiting for the European PSN network.

640
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So, yeah, he's actually saying that we, and this is a quote, we are a PAL market and we are going to do it in PAL and we are going to do it properly.

641
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So, he said that if you want the good quality, then you can, you know, I guess just wait for it or download it like everyone else does.

642
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's not often you hear people acknowledging. He's an idiot.

643
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I have something I want to say about Sony, which is completely off base, so before I go on tangent, does anyone want to comment on the actual story?

644
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Okay, I saw Casino Royale for the first time last night, which by the way, I forgot how sexy Bond movies are.

645
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Isn't James Bond just a sexy fucking franchise of movies?

646
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I don't know, I haven't watched the last movie.

647
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But just in general, all the way back to the Sean Connery days, Dark Sakura?

648
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
If you say so.

649
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Really? I think they're hot.

650
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I like certain movies, I'll put it that way.

651
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
This is how it's relevant. They hoard Sony in that movie.

652
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,000
James Bond uses a VAIO, the cell phones were from Sony, like the movie studio to put that out, I'm sure, was Sony Pictures.

653
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I just lolled at the fact how much Sony was hoarded in that movie. It was just kind of fun.

654
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Like, I noticed. Usually, I don't notice those things, but...

655
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And like if we made a movie, we would be putting orange on stuff all over it?

656
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Well, that's different.

657
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We're trying to buy dinner. These people have a lot of money.

658
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Well, they're trying to buy a lot of dinner at the same time.

659
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Alright, forget it. Move on.

660
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Anyways, so, in case you had some hope out there that Final Fantasy XIII Versus was possibly coming to the Xbox 360,

661
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Square says, no it's not. In fact, according to their video that they played during their latest kind of fan event,

662
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't even know how you would pronounce this, DKS3713 party.

663
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Anyways, they had the video for Final Fantasy Versus which said, PlayStation 3 only worldwide.

664
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And in small print, fuck you, Xbox 360 fanboys. No, just kidding.

665
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It was not coming out on the 360. Although, I'd be interested to see if that's actually going to be the case

666
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
when the 360 version of Final Fantasy XIII comes out and kicks ass sales-wise.

667
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But, we'll see. At least it's exclusive for the meantime.

668
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It gives the fanboys something to hold onto, right?

669
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Sure.

670
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm interested in Final Fantasy XIII Versus. If it stays a PlayStation 3 exclusive, I will probably have to pick up the PlayStation 3.

671
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Isn't anyone at all disturbed at the fact that they're releasing like four different Final Fantasy XIII games at the same time?

672
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
No, because they've released like seven different Final Fantasy VII games.

673
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah, over the course of like five years or something, but now it's just like, hey, those all sold really well.

674
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Let's make a lot of games all, you know, portioned apart.

675
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And you won't be buying them?

676
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I will be buying every single... No, two of the three. One of which happens to be on, well, one of them that I will not be buying is on the PSP.

677
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But, you know, that's a whole other story we already touched on.

678
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Let's talk about this, though, as far as Final Fantasy XIII is concerned.

679
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The question is when. When is this game going to come out?

680
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The game will be coming out in Japan in 2009. That is confirmed.

681
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It was announced at Squeenix's little get-together thing they had in Japan this past week.

682
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Now, keep in mind that means only the PlayStation 3 version and only in Japan, because they're not going cross-platform over in Japan.

683
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
However, it will be out in 2009, and then they're going to start the localization and the port for the Xbox 360,

684
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
which probably means we'll see it in 2010, because when they say they're going to get it in 2009, that probably means Christmas of 2009.

685
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But we'll see. We could be pleasantly surprised. Who knows?

686
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
All I know, I can't wait to see what the game actually looks like.

687
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
We'll see.

688
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Well, in other news related to Squeenix, they actually have a bunch of games that are going to be coming out for the DS in Japan,

689
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and they're calling this new line Pure Dreams.

690
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,000
There are two games that are going to be the first two out. One is Snoopy DS, Let's Go Meet Snoopy and His Friends,

691
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and then Pingu Waku Waku Carnival.

692
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't really know much about these games, except one of them is Snoopy, and the other one has a funny name,

693
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
but there's no release date for them in anywhere but Japan, and it just says Autumn.

694
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Really, it should be called Fozzie Waka Waka Carnival.

695
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That's Waku.

696
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I know.

697
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Okay.

698
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
He was making a bad joke.

699
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That was a really bad joke.

700
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm going to throw a tomato at Loki.

701
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
At least it's a lot better than, I don't know, a Snoopy game.

702
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Peanuts are still very popular overseas.

703
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Peanuts are still very popular in my house. I love peanuts.

704
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You know what will never stop being awesome? Ever? Snoopy snow cone machines.

705
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Those are the greatest thing ever.

706
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
See? I rest my case.

707
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Loki, remember? Remember when we lived together and I bought one?

708
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And it took me like an hour to make a goddamn little slushie?

709
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
To be honest, I don't remember that at all.

710
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I think that was a bastard.

711
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
No, seriously, I think you did that at your other apartment.

712
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
No, I'm almost positive it was when I lived with you.

713
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We were buying all sorts of random shit.

714
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I remember when you got the deep fryer for your birthday.

715
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That was a Christmas gift, okay?

716
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Okay, Christmas.

717
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And yes, I remember it because it was awesome. The only problem was it wasn't as awesome as it needed to be for deep frying.

718
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And that apartment did not have any sort of ventilation, which also sucked for deep frying.

719
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I really like video games. I just thought I'd let you guys know that.

720
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Really? Well good, I like deep frying and we're going to talk about that some more.

721
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Let's deep fry some video games.

722
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah. Whatever.

723
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Let's see.

724
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Not deep frying.

725
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Dark Tetsuya says, good grief, Rob.

726
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Alright, well something that's not Snoopy related, but a lot cooler.

727
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Japanese Advent Children fans are going to be happy that a brand new Director's Cut will be coming to Blu-Ray soon.

728
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And with it will be coming the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

729
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And with that will also be coming a new PS3 bundle.

730
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,000
All this is supposed to happen March 2009, and I don't know. I'm excited.

731
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
May have to import it.

732
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So is it just me, or is it one of those things where I should have known the whole time this is why Final Fantasy VII Advent Children was kind of short?

733
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
This was just coming the whole time.

734
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Bonus! 20 minutes deleted footage or whatever.

735
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Sucker. I should just tattoo it on my forehead.

736
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I should everyone else who bought it.

737
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I would also like to remind listeners of the show not to text me while I'm doing the show. Thank you.

738
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I get that too.

739
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Especially when I don't know who you are.

740
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I don't get that because I turn my phone off.

741
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Well good for you.

742
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Alright, the PSP game which Loki earlier referred to is that kind of missing Final Fantasy XIII game.

743
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You've heard a lot about Final Fantasy XIII and Versus XIII.

744
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Well there's also Agito XIII is coming out as well. Agito. Agito. Agito.

745
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's a cell phone game.

746
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That's the one that was supposed to be the cell phone game.

747
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
However, it's apparently also heading to the PSP.

748
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's part of the big franchise.

749
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I think this is great. It's going to allow the PSP to, especially in the US where our cell phones aren't going to be able to run it.

750
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm sure it's going to allow this to reach a much broader audience here.

751
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm sure the success of Crisis Core had something to do with that as well.

752
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So, more multi-platformism in the Square Enix world.

753
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And this game soon to be on the PSP. Well not soon.

754
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
But eventually, one day, far in the future, to be on the PSP.

755
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Well speaking of which, I don't know if anyone remembers that the latest Parasite Eve game was supposed to be exclusive on mobile phones.

756
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Well, Squeenix actually said that it will be out on PSP.

757
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And it doesn't say anything about there being a mobile phone version in development.

758
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But it's called The Third Birthday.

759
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And they had some sort of trailer of it up that has the main character Aya in a wedding dress.

760
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So, I don't know. Oh, with a gun.

761
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Well, because you have to have a gun.

762
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You have to have a gun.

763
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I was going to say, this is a franchise people have been waiting for for a long, long time.

764
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I think it's been bigger since the last one.

765
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's been a long time.

766
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Will she be in her birthday suit?

767
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I wish they'd translate the novel.

768
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah, that's right. There was like a novel. Wasn't there something else that was like a cell phone game or something?

769
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
There was also a live action movie.

770
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
There was a movie. I've got the movie somewhere, but I haven't watched it yet.

771
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But my friends read the novel a couple of times and it says it's pretty good.

772
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I saw the movie. It was pretty cool.

773
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I don't remember much of it though.

774
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I remember your mitochondria are full of evil.

775
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Son of Dad in chat says, Parasite Eve 2 is kind of a let down.

776
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Well, I didn't play it.

777
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Um, let's move on.

778
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Alright.

779
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Well, we're still waiting for home. Still.

780
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But the Japanese home beta has finally opened up.

781
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And they've added some interesting things to it as well.

782
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Including some Namco arcade classic games.

783
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Including Pacman, Dig Dug, that sort of stuff.

784
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That will be playable in the arcades that are strewn about the home interface.

785
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So they'll have the first few games that they mention Pacman, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Xevious.

786
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And there will be three secret titles that are still on the way.

787
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Mappy for the win.

788
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You know what? One good thing about this though, and I assume you don't have to pay to play these games,

789
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
is that you don't have to pay to play these games.

790
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's a hell of an assumption, by the way.

791
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah.

792
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Wouldn't it be interesting if you, because a lot of people thought this should be Xbox Live's prize model,

793
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
wouldn't it be interesting if you have to insert a quarter, quote unquote, to play the games?

794
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I will not be playing those games, then. That's the case.

795
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Because I have them on 360.

796
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Dark Soccer, I'm kind of curious what you think about the Namco games being in home,

797
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
because, you know, I know you're an avid collector of the museum games,

798
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
so it kind of feels like we've had to buy them before, and now they're going to be free, maybe?

799
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
If they're free, I'll get them. If not, I don't care.

800
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I mean, if they're not, I'm just not going to get them. I've got 50 million other copies.

801
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I have an actual cartridge of Mappy somewhere in my house, so it doesn't really matter.

802
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I've actually got, I think, almost the entire Namco PS1 collection.

803
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
That was the letters, right? M-A-M, yeah.

804
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Although I'm still trying to find the trademark for the Japanese releases.

805
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Ooh.

806
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah, I still had a hard time with that.

807
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Pooface in chat, I love that name, says,

808
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I hope that's not how the Xbox Prime Time games will work.

809
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Interesting thought. We haven't heard anything about how that 1 versus 100 or any of that stuff's going to work.

810
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So, who knows?

811
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
ActDef says, free is good, except for Yaris.

812
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I want to say those Prime Time games are probably going to be free,

813
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and they're going to probably finance them with advertisements.

814
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You know, that makes sense, I think.

815
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah, advertisements will make sense.

816
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It just, oh man, it's going to be just like the old Acrophobia days.

817
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I can't wait.

818
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That's how the Berkeley Systems games were funded, too.

819
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Anyhow, not all the news in Squeenix Land is good this week.

820
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
We have a crap ton of Final Fantasy news, but this is also Final Fantasy related.

821
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It has to do with Final Fantasy XI.

822
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh, remember my old crack?

823
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Remember Final Fantasy XI, the old crack game?

824
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I try not to.

825
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Well, how hard was it for you to cancel Final Fantasy XI when you finally did it?

826
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Not that hard.

827
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I didn't find it to be that hard, either.

828
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Do you remember, Loki?

829
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It was fucking easy.

830
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah?

831
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It was just like stupid easy.

832
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Well, here's the thing.

833
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Apparently, someone does not agree, and the name is Alex Edwards, and he is actually kind

834
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
of, it's not so much a lawsuit, but what has happened is one thing has led to another.

835
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
There is now a new Illinois law that mandates that MMO providers have to make an online

836
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
cancellation option available, that you have to be able to do it online.

837
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It is online.

838
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
That's what I was thinking, but here's the deal.

839
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Here's how the story goes.

840
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
This guy was playing Final Fantasy XI.

841
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
He grew tired of the game.

842
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
His parents were paying $13 a month, and they tried to cancel the account online, but the

843
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
claim is that Final Fantasy didn't offer them a way to do it online, didn't offer a contact

844
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
phone number, so finally, they went to the credit card statement to get the phone number,

845
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
spent an hour and 45 minutes on hold.

846
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Finally, someone answered the phone, and they got it canceled.

847
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's just because they're stupid.

848
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You have to do it through Play Online.

849
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
They're retarded.

850
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
They're absolutely retarded.

851
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You don't do it through the website.

852
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You do it through Play Online.

853
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I bet what happened is he uninstalled all the crap, and then was like, and you know

854
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
how awful Play Online is to uninstall, and then it was like, oh crap, I can't delete

855
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
it from the website.

856
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I was supposed to do that on Play Online.

857
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Well, duh, that's what the instructions say, and you have a manual.

858
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Hi.

859
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Well, maybe in that regard, does it have some merit then that you actually have to still

860
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
have the game installed to be able to cancel it?

861
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I mean, to be honest, you don't for Warcraft.

862
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You can do that all on the website.

863
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It's super easy.

864
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I mean, if you can't figure out how to cancel, wow, you're dumb.

865
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I mean, it's really, really easy to cancel, wow.

866
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
He just pissed off that there's no big, giant button that encompasses the entire screen

867
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that says, to cancel, click here.

868
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The easy button.

869
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I mean, seriously, it was not that hard to figure out how to cancel.

870
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It wasn't hidden in menus.

871
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It was so easy.

872
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It was right on the Play Online screen if you wanted to cancel it.

873
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And obviously they had to have signed up for an account, and it's done the exact same way

874
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
as you cancel it, so they're retarded.

875
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm sorry.

876
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And the fact that this went all the way to become a law, wow.

877
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's a case of people overcomplicating a simple issue.

878
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Hey, folks in Illinois, I hope that you're happy that your tax money's being used this way.

879
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Just because I wanted to read the summary of the actual law.

880
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
An Internet gaming service provider that provides service to a consumer for a stated term

881
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
that is automatically renewed for another term, unless a consumer cancels the service,

882
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
must give a consumer who is an Illinois resident a secure method

883
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
at the Internet gaming service provider's Web site

884
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
that the consumer may use to cancel the service,

885
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
which method shall not require the consumer to make a telephone call

886
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
or send US Postal Service mail to effectuate the cancellation,

887
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and two, instructions that the consumer may follow to cancel the service

888
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
at the Internet gaming service provider's Web site.

889
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,520
site. Makes it an unlawful business practice for an internet gaming service provider to

890
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,300
violate the new provisions. Now is it just me though, or was it a heck of a lot easier

891
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:36,300
to cancel Final Fantasy XI than it was to cancel America Online? Maybe I'm crazy, but

892
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:41,780
at least they weren't begging me to stay. Actually, if you call them and do it, they'd

893
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,620
try to get you to stay by giving you free months. On Final Fantasy XI even? No, on...

894
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,500
Oh, oh yeah. Oh yeah, America Online tries to pull it all out, so... I was like, um,

895
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:58,500
my account was already free. Retention. Anyhow, so, there you have it, new laws. Ridiculous.

896
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:05,700
Oh my god, this is stupid. But anyway, how about some release dates? Like, three items

897
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,800
coming out on the 8th in Europe. We have Beijing 2008, the official video game of the Olympic

898
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Games on PC, Race Driver Grid on DS, and The Mummy Tomb of the Emperor on Playstation 2.

899
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,800
That's it. Sorry. I can't say that the US is much better. This week we have the King

900
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:34,280
of Clubs, which is some crappy golf game on the Wii. There's Summer Athletics, I believe

901
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:42,300
the 360 version coming out this week, for some reason it was delayed from last week.

902
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,920
Rock Blast, which is a DS puzzle game. Monster Madness, Grave Danger, which apparently is

903
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,360
a slightly upgraded version of the Monster Madness game that was on the 360. So, I don't

904
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:01,360
know what you get when you upgrade crap, but I'm probably guessing it's not that great.

905
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:10,360
And yeah, B-Boy is also coming out this week on PS2 and PSP. And to be honest, I think

906
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:16,200
that's about it. I mean, slow week. Wow, is it just me, or is it kind of a slow release

907
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:23,200
week in general over there? Well, it's slow because of Madden coming out next week. Ah,

908
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,080
yeah. That's the game I don't get too excited about. Oh, there's a Cheetah Girls game coming

909
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:34,080
out, my mistake. How could I have missed that? Damn, fired. I know, seriously. Why am I not

910
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,800
keeping up with the Cheetah Girls games? Well, in Japan we have a lot of stuff coming out.

911
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,380
They also have a sports game coming out this week. It's NBA 2K8 is coming out in Japan

912
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,900
on August the 7th, as well as Tales of Vesperia comes out. There also is a super premium pack

913
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,440
for Tales of Vesperia coming out this week. I believe that is the one that comes with

914
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,600
the Xbox 360, if I'm not mistaken. I think there was a bundle pack coming out in Japan.

915
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,120
Don't quote me on that. Also, a PlayStation 3 version of NBA 2K8 is being released this

916
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:06,120
week. Moving on to the Nintendo Wii. Survival Kids Wii. I wonder if that's lost in blue.

917
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,800
It is lost in blue. Yeah, I think it is. Yes, it's lost in blue on the Wii. So that's coming

918
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:18,800
out. Imabikiosu Kamihan comes out as well on the Wii this week from Sega. And this game

919
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
looks to be, what the heck, it looks like it might be kind of a horror type game on

920
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,720
the Wii. Looks like the graphics are pretty cool. Got some neat little cut scenes there.

921
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,800
I don't know, that's either a horror game or a dating sim. But seeing as it looks like

922
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,920
it's a horror game. Yeah, it looks like a horror game, but seriously, in this one screen

923
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,760
you have ABC choices. That looks like a dating sim to me. It's a super emo horror game. That'd

924
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:51,760
be awesome. A horror dating sim. I think the brains at the O.L. Army headquarters need

925
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,920
to get to work on a horror dating sim. Not a whore, but a horror. On the PlayStation

926
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,480
2, God of War 2 gets a price reduction this week in Japan, moving into the best price

927
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,480
series. Also, Grim Grimoire and Sengoku Barasa 2 Heroes also move into that same series.

928
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,760
Some new games coming out this week. True Tears is coming out as well as Aokoro no Kusabi.

929
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,760
Hiro no Kakeru 3 comes out in Japan this week, which is, looks like some type of role

930
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:29,080
playing-ish game. You play a dude with a sword. I don't know, it kind of looks like a dating

931
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:36,080
sim. Why would he have a sword if it's a dating sim? Because all cool kids have swords who

932
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:43,680
date, because if it goes bad, you know, they can commit suicide. Just stop. Just stop.

933
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,440
Hey, I just wanted to mention real quick that in a couple weeks, actually, we're going to

934
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:54,880
be getting Lion Rider 2, which is exciting for the DS and the Wii. On the Nintendo DS,

935
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,880
Monster Farm 2 DS in Japan this week, as well as Fire Emblem. Shinankoku Ryotun Hikari no

936
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,280
Ken comes out this week, as well as Choshiotu Kadukistu, which is a game from Atlus, comes

937
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:17,960
out on the Nintendo DS this week, which, oh, it's Trauma Center 2. Nice. You finally get

938
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,960
that in Japan this week. Coming out on the Sony PSP, just some price reductions on Quiz

939
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:32,040
Mobile Suit Gundam Tonsenshi, as well as Daisenryaku Portable 2 and Doku Maki Murikai. They all

940
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,460
get price reductions this week, but as far as new games go, Crazy Taxi Double Punch comes

941
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,080
out on the PSP this week in Japan. That's happy. Get ready to make some crazy money.

942
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,920
That's it for your Japanese release dates. Back to some gaming news. Well, in other gaming

943
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:55,700
news, and this actually isn't necessarily just Just Just Game, but this is for our cosplay

944
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:02,160
people as well. Gamefly is having an open casting for the next commercial, so they actually

945
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,680
want cosplayers to send them videos saying why they love Gamefly, and why the character

946
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:15,680
that they're dressed up at is their favorite. But, you know, I think it's going to be kind

947
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,760
of iffy, but here's the details if anyone wants it. There are live casting calls that

948
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:28,600
are going to be in LA, New York, and Chicago. That's in September, and you actually send

949
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:35,600
a 45 second entry after August 26th. As far as more information on this, the live casting

950
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:41,600
calls are September 9th, Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Highland Center, and that's 12 to 6 p.m.

951
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:48,600
PST. September 16th in Chicago, ESPN Zone on East Ohio Street from 12 to 6 central time,

952
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:57,600
and September 23rd, New York at Hawaiian Tropic Zone on 7th Avenue and 49th Street at 12 to

953
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,600
6 p.m. EST. All those cosplayers are going to fit right in at Hollywood and Highland.

954
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:10,600
I actually told Rama the minute I read about this, I went to Twitter and I posted, Rama,

955
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,600
Black Luigi needs to be in this commercial. Make it happen. So he said he's going to go,

956
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,600
so I hope if he... Cover it for us. Yeah, cover it for us. I want to know if it is any

957
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:26,600
good or if it seems like a scam or whatever, but I think it'll be good. I want lots of

958
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,600
photos from this event. You know people are going to go just for the photo ops because

959
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,600
that's like half the big thing about cosplay is your photo ops too. Any excuse to be on

960
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,600
TV, people are going to go nuts. You know people are going to see these commercials

961
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:45,600
and go, what? Yeah, I know. But there will be other people that get it. Hey, cosplay

962
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:51,600
opportunity, go for it. Exactly. Hey, cosplayers can get like actual real recognition in the

963
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,600
real world. I think it's a good thing. So there you go. Loki is going to be giving us

964
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,600
a massive homebrew update tonight. What is this? There's like massive amounts of news

965
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:06,600
in the homebrew world. Just a bunch of little small things. Okay, so first off we're going

966
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,600
to start with the Wii. If you've never done homebrew or are having trouble figuring it

967
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:17,600
out, they actually have a website now that'll make it a lot easier for you and it's presented

968
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:22,600
by Wii Brew and it's the Wii Pack generator and what it does is it allows you to kind

969
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:28,600
of toggle different things you want to be installed in one giant zip file and you download

970
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:34,600
it and you drag and drop it to your SD memory card and if you have Twilight Princess you

971
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,600
can use the Twilight Hack to install the homebrew channel and a bunch of different homebrew

972
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,600
programs on there and they've got a huge list of stuff and they keep adding more to it so

973
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,600
definitely the way to go if you haven't done homebrew stuff yet or if you just want to

974
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,600
take it easy to find all your programs in one spot. Rob I think will get some use out

975
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,600
of this but they have the Any Title Deleter. It's a space-freeing program for the Wii.

976
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:06,600
It allows you to remove previously unremovable tiles including the weather and news channel.

977
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Unfortunately though if you have any games that have updates they will reinstall them

978
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:17,600
for you. But I like the weather channel because I like the music. What about the news channel?

979
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,600
Okay news channel is kind of a waste. Okay so you can remove stuff if you want to and

980
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,600
some other things like that and they have protection so you don't break your console

981
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,600
and that kind of thing. One thing though that is a little bit more risky but you can do

982
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:35,600
it as well with this is the Wii Region Changer. You can actually use this device to change

983
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:40,600
the region of your Wii so that it's a Japanese console. Of course everything will be in Japanese.

984
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,600
There is some risk involved with it though. You have to read the instructions very carefully

985
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,600
because you can actually break your console with this if it's not done right.

986
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:54,600
So don't do it. Yeah. Just don't. Just don't. There's region free players on the Wii so

987
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:02,600
just use those instead. Guitar Fun which is the Fretz of Fire game that they have now

988
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:09,600
for the Wii and that of course for those who may not know is a Guitar Hero sim or emulator

989
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,600
I guess. And you can import custom songs and all sorts of things. Well the new version

990
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:20,600
2.9 has come out. It's still in beta but it now has online support and so they have

991
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:26,600
instructions on how you can set up your PC or router I guess to be able to play online

992
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,600
with other people. So that's kind of neat though. You can do online. I don't know if

993
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,600
you can actually do online on the Wii with Guitar Hero 3. I think you might be able to

994
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:42,600
but either way it's so cool. Now for the PS3. It's actually interesting. There's some

995
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,600
sort of a homebrew scene actually starting up on the PS3 now that people figured out

996
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:52,600
that you can use the Blu-ray Java dev kit to actually create programs that can run on

997
00:50:52,600 --> 00:51:00,600
the PS3 and no modding is needed whatsoever because it's running off the BDJ Java that's

998
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,600
built into any Blu-ray disc. So it's already built into the system and so people are actually

999
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,600
creating like Pong programs and all the simple stuff that comes out in the very beginning

1000
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,600
but it's only going to lead to more and the best part you know they aren't really going

1001
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,600
to be disabling it anytime soon since it's built into all the Blu-ray discs so basically

1002
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:26,600
you just load the programs onto a jump drive and away you go. So that's pretty cool. And

1003
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:34,600
let's see. And that's it. Alright. Lots to do in the homebrew world. Yes. But I don't

1004
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,600
have time for homebrew unless there's something really really good that I'm really missing

1005
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,600
but lately I haven't been that excited about it. Well there's actually one thing that they've

1006
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,600
been kind of trailering on a bunch of websites this week. Remember that game I was playing

1007
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:52,600
before called No Gravity? It was a homebrew PSP game that was kind of a space shooter.

1008
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Like a 3D space shooter. It's actually now becoming a full game on the Playstation Network

1009
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,600
that's going to be downloadable via them. You actually have to pay for it now. But you'll

1010
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,600
be able to download it to your PSP and play it but it's the first time that a homebrew

1011
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:12,600
game like this has become downloadable on the Playstation platform so that's kind of

1012
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:18,600
neat. And hopefully they'll be coming soon. Okay. Well I wanted to read this comment from

1013
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:24,600
chat. Going back to the cosplay gamefly commercial thing. SSJ100Matt I believe was the one that

1014
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:32,600
said this. Manfay. Could Manfay make an appearance? Manfay would either be scary or fantastic.

1015
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:39,600
That's kind of both extremes don't you think? I want the male Utena cosplayer to show up

1016
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,600
who looked perfectly female. I wish I lived in New York with Rama because I'd go and dress

1017
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:51,600
as Black Mage. So maybe we could both be in it. I'm not sure what Black Mage has in common

1018
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:58,600
with Luigi but you never know. I am very excited about this upcoming game and Dark Sakura.

1019
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:04,600
I don't know about you but maybe you'll play this with me. Sing Star Musicals is a new

1020
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:10,600
rumored game to be coming out. Supposedly it's going to be coming out in 2009 and some

1021
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,600
songs that are rumored to be in it. Bad Guys from Bugsy Malone. Can You Feel the Love Tonight

1022
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,600
from The Lion King. If I Were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof and Over the Rainbow from

1023
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:27,600
Wizard of Oz. However I need this song to be in it. If at all possible.

1024
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:44,600
Oh not Springtime for Hitler. No you should find the one from the movie. Is that the one

1025
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:51,600
from the movie? No. It's just because John Barrowman sang the one in the movie. I don't

1026
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,600
think they have the one from the movie on iTunes. The recent movie because well I think

1027
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,600
he's wonderful. So yeah this is a rumored game that's going to be coming out. That being

1028
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,600
said I actually think this rumor is bull. I think this rumor is a load of crap. I don't

1029
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:10,600
believe that it's true. One of the big reasons I don't think it's true is that this rumored

1030
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:15,600
song list has Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King. Disney owns that and if

1031
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,600
Disney was going to put that in a game Disney would be making a Disney game. Disney I don't

1032
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,600
think would be likely to loan this out. One of their biggest songs. I mean granted I don't

1033
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,600
know I guess Elton John wrote it so maybe there's a way around it. And it's not really

1034
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,600
a musical either. Actually yes they did a Lion King musical. I know they did but it's

1035
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,600
Disney's musical. It's not Sony's you know what I mean and I don't think Sony would be

1036
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,600
able to license that from Disney. Does that make sense? I don't know if it's necessarily

1037
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:46,600
Disney that owns Soul Rites. Plus I mean would there really be that many people that are

1038
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:53,600
going to buy this? I mean maybe. I would. I would too but we're kind of weird. So? Okay

1039
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,600
then again I guess Poofy said they made Sing Star Bollywood so I guess anything's possible.

1040
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:04,600
Well yeah. Well then again I mean that would. That makes sense though for a European release.

1041
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,600
It does. It does. And maybe this isn't something that's going to be coming out here. Maybe

1042
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,600
this will be coming out in other areas where Sing Star is bigger. Well if it's a Sing Star

1043
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:18,600
game I would suspect that it would be a European release. Well I still want to import it. This

1044
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:24,600
will be fun. Well you know there's also been a big surge in West End theater now. Especially

1045
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,600
with those shows that they're doing now. Sort of like an American. Well not like. Sort of

1046
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:35,600
like a pop idol though for musicals. How do you solve a problem like Maria? And the other

1047
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,600
one. Hey that was a John Barrowman show. Yes it was. I'm thinking you're a fangirl. I'm

1048
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:45,600
a little bit of a fangirl. But it just seemed to me that theater's having such a bigger

1049
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,600
resurgence overseas that it could be possible that that's why there'd be a Sing Star game.

1050
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,600
So I could sort of see it happening. I do have one other request for Sing Star musicals.

1051
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:00,600
You are ruining my song. Oh me sorry. Me no mean to. Well if you wouldn't mind please

1052
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:07,600
being quiet for a minute so I can finish. Okie dokie. Good. I'm glad we have this new

1053
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:17,600
technology. For porn. Which gives us untold opportunity. For porn. Oh sorry. God it'll

1054
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:25,600
never get old. Avenue Q is playing in town Rob. We need to go seriously. I know. For

1055
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:31,600
porn. We've said that as the previous cage match winner if I do recall correctly. I'm

1056
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:37,600
sure. I think it was a cage match winner at one point. Love it. And a very good question

1057
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:42,600
from chat. Very very good informed question. SSJ100Matt says Rob what about Sing Star

1058
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:49,600
Rocky Horror Edition? Yes please. That would be hot. How do you do I? See you've met my

1059
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:57,600
faithful handyman. But it has to have an audience participation subtract. Yes. But people

1060
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,600
and you know this. Do you know how much money I would pay for Loki to sing Sweet Transvestite

1061
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,600
Live on Air? I would put money in that pot seriously. I totally would. You should just

1062
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:13,600
sing it for us right now anyway. In a single costume. We're waiting. No. Chirp chirp chirp.

1063
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,600
Alright Sing Star musicals hopefully coming to a Playstation near you. I have something

1064
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:23,600
that's even more in the special category if we can get on to our next segment. We absolutely

1065
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,600
can. It's a segment we love to do every week. It's very special. It's the classic video

1066
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,600
game of the week. Dark Soccer will dig through the archive and tell you kids what you should

1067
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:37,600
be playing. What should the children be paying a little respect to this week? The game of

1068
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:46,600
the week is Jumping Flash. Nice. I love Jumping Flash. But I've mentioned this show on air

1069
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:54,600
many many many times. When I first moved into my college dorm room I was put in charge of

1070
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:01,600
my friend's boyfriend's Playstation. And he had Jumping Flash and I played the hell out

1071
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:07,600
of it and it was an awesome game. So the story behind this and I love this. That a demented

1072
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:15,600
astrophysicist named Baron Aloha removed pieces from earth with land lifting machines

1073
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:25,600
and so this cute little electric bunny named Robin has to use these jet pods to you know

1074
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:31,600
I guess break these jet pods and get the little islands back to earth. What? Can I just say

1075
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,600
to son of dad in chat this is not Jumping Jack Flash with Whoopi Goldberg. No. This

1076
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,600
is different. Stop it. Anyway the way that the game plays is it is very first person

1077
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:50,600
and I will tell you that this totally totally made me motion sick as hell but it's great.

1078
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,600
Actually the article makes a note that it's actually just like a game called Geograph

1079
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:01,600
Seal which is for the Sharp X68000 so I'll have to look for that later on. But anyway

1080
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,600
you play as Robin looking through Robin's eyes and you've got a screen showing you how

1081
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:12,600
much time you have remaining and your score and the sidekick called Kumagoro which gives

1082
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:19,600
you hints and warnings and helps you out. You've also got fireworks items as your sort

1083
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:24,600
of like your firing mechanism, power ups, jet pods, all this other neat stuff that goes

1084
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,600
with it. But so the big thing about it though is you have to jump and you can make him jump

1085
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:35,600
three times. You can jump off the ground twice in mid air and you can get really high over

1086
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:44,600
the ground. And instead of though being faced horizontally when you jump the camera tilts

1087
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:50,600
down towards the ground. So it's, you see why I'm talking about getting motion sick

1088
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:57,600
there too? But you can also use your enemies to bounce off of in some cases. But you get

1089
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:02,600
different fireworks for attacks like cherry bombs, rockets, roaming candles, and twisters.

1090
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:09,600
You can get time extensions, you can get different jet pods that are EXIT and so when you get

1091
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:15,600
them you go to the exit pad and you can leave the level. You also have hidden levels, you

1092
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:21,600
have a roller, the roller coaster level was fun I have to say. And you have a time attack

1093
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:28,600
mode so you can try to get out of the levels in a certain amount of time. There also was

1094
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:35,600
a sequel that was called Jumping Flash 2 that did not do as well. But it was still a fun

1095
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:42,600
game. And apparently there were pseudo sequels that were only released in Japan. There was

1096
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:50,600
Robert Mundo on Playstation and Pocket Moomoo that was on Pocket Station and they were released

1097
01:00:50,600 --> 01:01:02,600
by Sugar and Rockets whereas these were actually released by Exact. Was Baron Aloha in Project

1098
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,600
Moomoo or Pocket Moomoo? I actually do not know, I have not played Pocket Moomoo. It

1099
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,600
sounds like someone needed a vacation in Hawaii. But I came really close to actually importing

1100
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:17,600
Robert Mundo once. I guess now I could find it a lot cheaper I'm sure. But it's actually,

1101
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:24,600
you can get Jumping Flash at the Playstation store. And coming soon the next sequel, Captain

1102
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:32,600
Uma Uma Nuka Nuka Appa Waha. Never mind. Bad joke. Oh come on Ferret. I never actually

1103
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:38,600
played Jumping Flash. You didn't! No I never did. I have Jumping Flash in the massive old

1104
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:44,600
Playstation cases. Keep in mind, Playstation 1 era was around the time I was in college.

1105
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,600
So the only Playstation 1 games I really got into, yeah but I kind of left gaming for a

1106
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,600
little while. I really only was playing like Final Fantasy 7 and Puzzle Fighter. I didn't

1107
01:01:53,600 --> 01:02:01,600
play a whole lot during that era. Puzzle Fighter came out years after. At any rate, if you

1108
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,600
want to play this game then I will see about locating my copy of it and bringing it over

1109
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:12,600
or something. But it's really, it's cheese ball and it's you know, it's early Playstation

1110
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:18,600
but it's a fun little game. Alright. That's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge

1111
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,600
Radio with that Jumping Flash, your classic game of the week. We're going to take a quick

1112
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:27,600
break but we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after some music for the

1113
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,600
live listeners. And actually if things get sent to me in time here we'll do some music,

1114
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,600
oh yes we're going to have some music on the podcast as well tonight as well. I'll tell

1115
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,600
you a little bit more about that in just a minute. But we'll be back with more of Orange

1116
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Lounge Radio.

1117
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:52,600
Hey all our listeners, this is GS68 with a public service announcement. When playing

1118
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,600
Super Smash Brothers, do not have fun. Do not play with items on. Items ruin the balance

1119
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:02,600
of the game and add randomness. Do not pick low tier characters. You will not win them

1120
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:07,600
with them no matter what. The best balance repair will always lose to the worst fox player.

1121
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:12,600
The only stage allowed is Final Destination. If a stage has more than a flat plane on it,

1122
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,600
it's bad. It ruins the balance of the game by giving characters advantages. Take your

1123
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:22,600
episode of gimmicks and shove it. Huge stages like Hammer Castle for camping morons. Even

1124
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,600
Smashville is barely acceptable but there's a freaking moving platform on top of the main

1125
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:31,600
platform. And finally, remember, I don't care if you're at a party and just want to have

1126
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,600
fun with your friends. Video games are not about fun. They're about winning. So shut

1127
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,600
the fuck up and stop having fun because video games are serious business. Thank you and

1128
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,600
good night. This PSA was brought to you by Mushroom Kingdom, one of the never-ending

1129
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,600
scrolling bullshit.

1130
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Be sure to navigate through the forums and find the

1131
01:03:50,600 --> 01:04:19,600
O.L. Archive, where you can find such clips as this.

1132
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:29,600
Oh yes, the good old days of Orange Lounge Radio.

1133
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,600
That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter closet, wasn't it?

1134
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,600
I think so. I think it was one of those weekends back when Karaoke Revolution was funny.

1135
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:41,600
Anyhow, thanks to our listeners who provided the bumpers that break. GS68 was the first

1136
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:47,600
one and PKJR92 did the second one. So thank you guys so much for those bumpers. If you

1137
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,600
have a bumper you want to send, go look at the forums. There's a whole post about us

1138
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:57,600
accepting things for our free break and that would be fake PSAs, promos for non-profit

1139
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:02,600
shows and things like that and so on. So hope to get some stuff from you.

1140
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,600
Meanwhile, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August

1141
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:13,600
the 3rd of 2008, for more Orange Lounge Radio gaming news, gaming chat, gaming bitching

1142
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,600
and whatever we can come up with. Loki, how about some Xbox news?

1143
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:25,600
Yeah, so there's another rumor coming out. Yeah, another one. I know. This one actually

1144
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:33,600
has come from Ars Technica and apparently they have their Microsoft insider who lets

1145
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:39,600
them know all the wonderful rumors and information and stuff like that. They were ones, I believe

1146
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:45,600
he was the one that was kind of clueing people in on that 68 model that was going to be introduced.

1147
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:54,600
Well now, apparently sometime in September, there is going to be another price drop and

1148
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:58,600
it's going to be dropping. This is actually the price drop because if you remember the

1149
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:03,600
last one was kind of the phase out 20 gig models but I guess by that time they'll be

1150
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:11,600
all gone. What's going to happen is the Elite is going to drop down to $399 from $449 so

1151
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:18,600
that's a pretty nice drop there, another $50. The 68 system will drop down to what the

1152
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:28,600
Pro system is now for $299 and the Arcade system will drop from $279 to $199. So that's

1153
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:34,600
pretty cool. And apparently around that time also the hard drive, the 120 hard drive is

1154
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:39,600
supposed to drop in price and I think probably the 60 as well will be coming out at some

1155
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:45,600
point. And the other interesting thing about that that kind of coincide with all that is

1156
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:55,600
there was some screenshots on VG charts apparently from the inside of their, some system, I don't

1157
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:01,600
know what store this is from but it's saying that the price drop is going to happen confirmed

1158
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:08,600
on the Arcade system on September 7th, 2008. So that seems to give us a little more legitimacy

1159
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,600
than when this rumor usually flies around because I was just about to ask, what makes

1160
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,600
this any different from any other price cut rumor? Yeah, and well what's interesting though

1161
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:21,600
September 7th, that's another Sunday and they like to drop them on Sundays so they can have

1162
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,600
the ads and everything. And if you think about it, it makes sense too because everyone's

1163
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:31,600
saying, oh it's because the exclusives are coming out for the Xbox 360, you know Infinite

1164
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Undiscovery and Rock Band 2, well a time exclusive for Rock Band 2, but I say it's because the

1165
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Playstation 3 exclusives are going to be coming out around that time too. Actually they're

1166
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:50,600
going to start coming out with a lot of their big Playstation exclusives around October

1167
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,600
7th and if they kind of get a jump on everything, especially now that they're talking about

1168
01:07:54,600 --> 01:08:03,600
putting out a core 80GB system out there for $399, you know it's kind of funny though,

1169
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:10,600
it just kind of nullifies all that. Well I say they're doing it to be ready for Christmas

1170
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:14,600
and also to get down there to where the Wii's at because now they're going to be the same

1171
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:22,600
price. Almost. Right? The Wii's, is Wii 199 or is Wii 250? Wii's 250. Oh, see they're

1172
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,600
going to be cheaper than the Wii at this point, that's huge. Yeah. That's really huge I think.

1173
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,600
Do you think Nintendo's going to have to follow suit? No. I guess not, Wii's are still in

1174
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,600
demand. Because they're very, I would say they're very arrogant, so unless the Wii system

1175
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:41,600
takes some hits as far as sales goes, then they may. I don't think they are because they're

1176
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,600
still high in demand and they're selling over retail anyways, so people have no problem

1177
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:51,600
paying the $400 for a Wii system right now. I don't know why you would, but they are.

1178
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,600
Alright, well we'll see. I'm sure it will drive sales come Christmas time if they do

1179
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,600
end up doing that. And I'm sure this is only a rumor because none of these rumors ever

1180
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,600
come true. I think there seems to be a lot of truth in this. I think we all know Xbox

1181
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,600
is going to cut the price and to really get below Nintendo I think is going to be huge

1182
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:15,600
for them. So we'll see. Anyhow though, I want to talk about this one reason that might sell

1183
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:21,600
a lot of Xbox is zombies. I love zombies. We don't have enough zombies on Xbox. I mean

1184
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,600
yeah, we have Dead Rising, but we don't have zombies on Xbox Live Arcade that I can think

1185
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,600
of. And when I talk about zombies, I'm talking about the actual tabletop game Zombies. I

1186
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,600
don't know if you've ever seen this game. It's an actual tabletop game that kind of

1187
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,600
uses cards. And you know, tabletop games have been kind of popular on Xbox Live lately.

1188
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,600
I mean you have Carcassonne, Catan, Ticket to Ride. You know, why not? Let's get zombies

1189
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,600
in there as well. And this actually had to do with a gamer who was actually like sending

1190
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:55,600
ideas on how to turn a zombie game into an Xbox Live Arcade game. Well apparently, according

1191
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:01,600
to a joystick report, that's joystick with a Q, they actually ran into Todd Breitenstein.

1192
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,600
He's from Twilight Creations who actually made the tabletop game. Ran into him at Comic

1193
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,600
Con, which happened recently. And in response to are they going to make a zombies game for

1194
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:16,600
Xbox Live, got the ever famous I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a project.

1195
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:23,600
But don't you think it would be cool? And the answer is yes. Zombies are always cool.

1196
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,600
Zombies are fantastic. So there you have it. Chat room, what do you think? Yes or no to

1197
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,600
zombies on Xbox Live? I'm all for more of the board game type fare on Xbox Live Arcade

1198
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:37,600
too. I think those games are fun. Well, and other fun. And this makes me particularly

1199
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:45,600
happy because you know I love Valve. Right? Well, you know that there's going to be a

1200
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:52,600
Portal Still Alive coming out on Xbox Live, but it looks like Valve is really considering

1201
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:58,600
bringing other titles from their services. So I think that's pretty cool. And that they

1202
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:05,600
actually don't yet have any immediate plans to try the Wii or PS3. So hey, they love you

1203
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:13,600
Microsoft Xbox owners. You have the love of Valve. Indeed. Very much. But you do not have

1204
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:19,600
GLaDOS in this one. And that is not as great. So do you think it's kind of a money milking

1205
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,600
thing? Kind of a cheap... Well, all business is money milking when you think about it.

1206
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:28,600
Yes, that's true. Only if you're a non-profit organization do you not look to make a profit,

1207
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:34,600
right? True. Commenting to a question Lieutenant Pliskin asked in chat says, can you put a

1208
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,600
hard drive in the no hard drive model of the 360? Let's say you want to download Portal

1209
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,600
Still Alive and these other possible future Valve releases. Yes, you can. You can put

1210
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,600
a hard drive in the core model. It's very easy. Actually, when I first got an Xbox 360,

1211
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,600
I actually bought mine when they were really hard to come by and Best Buy was only getting

1212
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,600
like five of them at a time. And when I got there, they didn't have elites. I was only

1213
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,600
able to get a core so I actually paid the slight extra money to get the core and the

1214
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,600
hard drive with it. Which at the time was worth it because you couldn't get an Xbox

1215
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:07,600
360 really. It was so hard. And then to put icing on the cake, I got the Red Ring of Death

1216
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,600
three days later. Remember that? Good times. Because I came on here and I bitched, whined

1217
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:17,600
and moaned on the show so bad. I was so pissed. But all is better now in Rob's world. Especially

1218
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:26,600
after the yumminess of Soul Calibur IV and Geometry Wars 2 this week. You know, I'm going

1219
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,600
to have to get that Geometry Wars, I think. At least get the demo. The demo from what

1220
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,600
I hear is almost the full deadline mode which is get as many points as you can in three

1221
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,600
minutes and it's a really good way to test if you're going to like the game or not. So,

1222
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:46,600
at least get the demo. So, let's move on. Okay, shit. Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you

1223
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:52,600
over there. Well, you guys were still talking about freaking Geometry Wars. I was waiting.

1224
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:59,600
Anyways, so, you may remember that the Bourne Supremacy just came out beginning of June

1225
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:06,600
and stuff and that was part of the whole VinVidi license and stuff, actually Sierra Entertainment.

1226
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:12,600
Well, now that they've been purchased by Activision and Blizzard have merged together, they're

1227
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,600
starting to, or Activision and VinVidi and Blizzard and all those companies have merged

1228
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,600
together, they're starting to kind of go through what franchises they own and kind of slim

1229
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:31,600
it down a bit. And one of those franchises, of course, is the Bourne Supremacy and, or

1230
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:36,600
Bourne Conspiracy, I'm sorry. And actually the whole Bourne lineup. In fact, there's

1231
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,600
some other stuff about that as well. But they're actually giving back the Bourne Conspiracy

1232
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:47,600
to Lundrum Entertainment, you know, because Robert Lundrum, of course, was the guy that

1233
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,600
wrote the Bourne books. So, it's kind of going back to them and I guess, I don't know if

1234
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:58,600
they want to put any other games out, they have to find a new publisher, I guess. Interesting.

1235
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:04,600
Well, you know, it didn't just stop there with the Bourne series. Activision and Blizzard,

1236
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,600
they're kind of looking at some of the other franchises as well. And some of the franchises

1237
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:12,600
that were rumored this week, Brutal Legend, Ghostbusters, the video game, were supposed

1238
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,600
to be lost. It actually came out a little later in the week, that is not true. Ghostbusters

1239
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:23,600
absolutely not canceled, according to Vivendi Sierra, not canceled. That is still happening.

1240
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,600
The spokesperson for Sierra had actually said, quote, first and foremost, the game is not

1241
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,600
canceled. However, the game may not have a publisher right now. That was a little more

1242
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:40,600
in the blue there. Also, Brutal Legend is fine. So, that series is still supposed to

1243
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:45,600
be on the way. Well, it's really weird, though, that they would keep Spyro, Crash, and all

1244
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,600
that stuff and get rid of, I don't know, the good games. Spyro's kind of a money machine.

1245
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,600
Yeah, and they kept 50 Cent, Blood in the Sand, or whatever that thing is. That game

1246
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:59,600
sounds very interesting. Chronicles of Riddick, apparently, was booted to the curb, too. Yeah,

1247
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,600
I mean, that, I think, was a long ways away, anyways. Well, I just hope they didn't get

1248
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:09,600
rid of the Island of Dr. Brain, am I right? What? Because the Island of Dr. Brain was

1249
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:16,600
an awesome Sierra game. If you say so. Remember, it was probably like a year ago, we had those

1250
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,600
kids that were making the Silver Lining, remember that, the unofficial King's Quest sequel,

1251
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,600
the Silver Lining? And then they went through that whole song and dance where they had to

1252
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,600
lose the King's Quest ties, and now the game is just being released as the Silver Lining.

1253
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:33,600
I wonder if all this recent, you know, Mergy-merge news means maybe they can get away with doing

1254
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:39,600
it as a King's Quest game again. I doubt it, but it's still nice to imagine. I suppose,

1255
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:45,600
if you want to keep dreaming. Yeah, I know. But hey, if we didn't have Dreamers, we also

1256
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,600
wouldn't have Bums, so, kidding. Lieutenant Pliskin makes a very excellent point in chat,

1257
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:57,600
chat.orangelsonsray.com. 50 Cent greater than Chronicles of Riddick? Both great. Question

1258
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,600
mark, question mark. You know what we need, speaking of like movie franchises from like

1259
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,600
10 years ago. What? When I went to see The Dark Knight the other day, they were showing

1260
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:11,600
on the screen a preview for Starship Troopers 3. Why did we never get a video game for that?

1261
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,600
I think there were video games. There was a PC game. Yes. We need more. And there's a

1262
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,600
comic right now. I know there's like comics and other types of things, but no good game

1263
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:27,600
where you can just go blow up bugs in the good old American way. Forget it. I tried.

1264
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:34,600
Anyway, well you know, I'm not sure if everyone's familiar, but there were screen captures and

1265
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:40,600
video out for Soul Calibur IV that was showing Darth Vader and Yoda in the same game, which

1266
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:48,600
as we knew, Yoda was in the Xbox 360 edition and Darth Vader was in the PS3 one. And the

1267
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:56,600
director of the game, Katsutoshi Sasaki, said that they don't have any plans for making

1268
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:02,600
either one downloadable content for either console. But then again, apparently those

1269
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:08,600
screen captures and the video that was out are supposed to be legitimate. You know, actual

1270
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:16,600
same versions of the game. So, maybe that was just like a... I would assume that in

1271
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,600
programming both characters would have been included, right? So it might just be from

1272
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:26,600
the developer's kit or something. You know, it could be either from the developer's kit

1273
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,600
or there's a rumor floating around and you really would have to read in between the lines.

1274
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,600
This guy is saying it's not going to be download content, right? But some of the rumors that

1275
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:39,600
are going around say that you will actually, if you buy The Force Unleashed, the game that

1276
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,600
The Apprentice or Starkiller is actually starring in, it unlocks the other Star Wars character

1277
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,600
on your respective system. That's smart. It's an interesting way of doing it. It's a way

1278
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,600
of saying, hey, buy this game and please don't think that it sucks. And so, you know, no,

1279
01:17:52,600 --> 01:18:00,600
it's not download content... It's the biggest version of Pay to Unlock ever. Seriously.

1280
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:05,600
Well, the question is then, if that's the case, then I wonder if it's a save file or

1281
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,600
something like that. Who knows? But the other thing to consider, there's a trailer for The

1282
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,600
Force Unleashed in the game. And I'm sure that's part of how they were able to negotiate

1283
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,600
Starkiller and Yoda being in the game. But just very interesting. It kind of makes you

1284
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:23,600
think, ah, maybe there's... I see what you did there. I would bet 10 to 1 that's going

1285
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,600
to be the way you unlock it is that you have to get Force Unleashed, which means it'll

1286
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:33,600
be impossible to find on Gamefly. And I wonder if having the fact that you have Soul Calibur

1287
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:39,600
IV if that unlocks something for you on The Force Unleashed. Perhaps. Maybe an alternate

1288
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:45,600
costume for Starkiller since he does have two in Soul Calibur. Who knows? Might be a

1289
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,600
little silly, but you never know. The unlocks aren't always that great. They should just

1290
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,600
chain them and they'll have something else and then you'll unlock... Just time release,

1291
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,600
Vader. You know, like three months from now, just time release them. Do a patch that unlocks

1292
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,600
them. It's obvious something's going to go there. There's one square in the game that

1293
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:07,600
is not filled in. And if you look on the PlayStation... That goes for nobody. It's very obvious.

1294
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,600
That's like, you know, one for me and one for my homies. They looped like six characters

1295
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:18,600
in one screen. The star screen. Not to be confused with Starkiller. They had famous

1296
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:23,600
anime creators make Soul Calibur characters, but they're just all filed under the star

1297
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,600
icon in the select menu. And some of them are pretty cool, actually. But anyhow, sorry.

1298
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:35,600
Getting off topic. That's interesting, though. Good theory. Something completely unrelated

1299
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:43,600
to Star Wars. The shit game, as I mentioned during my gaming week. It's a game that looks

1300
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:49,600
like shit. Literally. It basically looks like the whole game was made out of MS Paint, and

1301
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,600
it very well may have. But the whole reason, I guess, is it's supposed to be like all the

1302
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,600
shovelware games that you play out there. Just the absolute worst of the worst. But

1303
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:03,600
it is a pretty fun game, and it's just really strange looking. It's all black and white.

1304
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:08,600
Really strange stuff in there, from a level with crashing planes to a giant foot like

1305
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:18,600
Monty Python. Floating eyeballs. Awesome. Fire. All sorts of crazy stuff. And basically

1306
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,600
the game, I mean, it's very short, but it challenges you to try to beat it, losing the

1307
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,600
least amount of lives and getting through it quickly. And there are a lot of quick ways

1308
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:33,600
you can kind of glitch through the game and beat it a lot faster. So it is worth a download

1309
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:40,600
if you're looking to check it out. Go to Doomlaser.com, and there's an article there called

1310
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:45,600
a game by any other name would still be shit. I would actually like to see a game where

1311
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:56,600
a giant foot comes down and squashes your character and then suddenly... Yes. I knew

1312
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:03,600
this was coming. Oh, and the best part about the game, I forgot to mention, is that all

1313
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:11,600
the music in it is MIDI. And it's all like, you know, like pop music MIDI. Like they have

1314
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:17,600
Spice Girls in there, and it's all randomly selected too. Like Lenny Kravitz and Spice

1315
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,600
Girls and stuff. I think that from here on out, all the rest of Loki's stories should

1316
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:33,600
be done to Monty Python's Flying Circus opening. Okay, we can arrange that. Okay. We'll see

1317
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,600
how that works, we'll try. Now here's the thing though, wouldn't this be Shit Game 2?

1318
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:43,600
Because I've played Ping Pals. Well, Shit Game 3, because I've also played Yaris. Oh,

1319
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,600
I see. But see, that's the thing, is this game's actually better. But seriously though,

1320
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:53,600
the character looks like he's made from MS Paint, and I think he was. He looked all...

1321
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,600
It was hilarious, I watched the video of it. I did download the game before the show. Haven't

1322
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:04,600
played it yet, but I'm gonna give it a try. Is it maybe a minimalist thing? Like irony

1323
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,600
through minimalism? It's special. It is a very special game. You know, when we start

1324
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,600
putting naughty words into the names of video games, it makes us want to use other naughty

1325
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,600
words here on the program. We have one very naughty segment we do every week here on Orange

1326
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:39,600
Radio. You know what it's called? The FUs of the Week. My FU of the Week, it first of

1327
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:47,600
all goes towards my cat and her passengers. I have had to bathe the cat today. She has

1328
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:55,600
bad fleas, and they did not all wash off, so I have to get ahold of Heather, you know,

1329
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,600
I have to get ahold of Heather and get some front lines for my kitty cat. Well, I know

1330
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,600
Heather, but the listeners don't know Heather. Heather's awesome! Okay, that's all you need

1331
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:09,600
to know. That's all you need to know. But I have to get her treated and so she stops

1332
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,600
going bald out from her allergies and I don't know because I've been treating her for the

1333
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:20,600
last three months and nothing has helped her, so I'm just, I hate them. I hate the little

1334
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:27,600
squirmy things on my baby cat. Death to fleas. All of them! Except for Red Hot Chili Peppers.

1335
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:35,600
Because that flea is awesome. Okay. That flea may survive the flea holocaust. Yes. Alright.

1336
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,600
Lowkey, your FUs of the Week. A few people driving around, still talking on their cell

1337
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,600
phones without their Bluetooth headsets. Amen! I followed some chick today because... The

1338
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,600
speakerphone's okay, right? The speakerphone's fine. If you have a hands-free phone, I am

1339
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:55,600
fine with that because that's following the law and you shouldn't be as much of a nuisance

1340
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,600
on the road. But there's still these fucking people and they're idiots, they're talking

1341
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,600
around, you know, with their cell phones and just driving fucking slow and just really

1342
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:09,600
annoying. In fact, this woman actually, she drove through the parking lot really slow

1343
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,600
and then, oh, my other favorite thing is when there's a slight dip in the road or something

1344
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:19,600
like that and people slow the fuck down. Well, they're in an SUV, an off-roading vehicle

1345
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,600
and they slow the fuck down because it's a little dip in the road. Oh my god. That's

1346
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,600
also annoying. Just a point, though. Somebody talking on the cell phone in their parking

1347
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:33,600
lot wouldn't technically be illegal. They're still driving. I know, but it's technically

1348
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,600
they can't pull you over in the parking lot. Well, she's still driving around, so that

1349
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,600
still counts. Just a technicality. I'm just saying. And I followed her there, but she's

1350
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,600
a dumb bitch and I actually thought about knocking on her window and going, get off

1351
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:51,600
the fucking phone, ass. But no, I had better things to do. Alright, is that it? That's

1352
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:56,600
it. Alright. F you to clothes shopping. I went clothes shopping yesterday. Actually,

1353
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,600
shopping for clothes is fun. It's grown a meal. I used to hate it when I was younger,

1354
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,600
but now I love shopping for clothes. The only thing I don't like is paying for them. And

1355
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,600
I'm not advocating theft of clothes, but I went to Mervyn's this week because I heard

1356
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,600
they were filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy and I want to make sure I get all the good sales

1357
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,600
before the chain goes under. And also, thanks to me being sick earlier this year and the

1358
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,600
diet that has resulted, I've lost another waist size. So I had to buy all new jeans,

1359
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:30,600
and that's expensive. Clothes are expensive. So F you to expensive clothes. But a non-F

1360
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,600
you to Mervyn's and a non-F you to Mervyn's sales, because those are both awesome. I still

1361
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,600
need to go to the outlets though this week, because the outlets are the best thing ever.

1362
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,600
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news. I will bring it back with Mega Man 9 news.

1363
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,600
It seems like every week there's something new about Mega Man 9. People loving the retro,

1364
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:52,600
you know, coming back to this. Here's the neat thing is that Capcom has said this week

1365
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,600
that the WiiWare version of Mega Man 9, it will have different control options. You can

1366
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:01,600
turn the Wii mode on its side to play the game. You can also use the classic controller.

1367
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:06,600
Anything that will go into the GameCube port you can also use to play. So if you think

1368
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:11,600
about it, you could go all the way back to the Wii NES Retro port. You know, this is

1369
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:17,600
a device that was released that allows you to, yes, plug in your old school NES controller

1370
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,600
and play Mega Man 9 the way it might have been meant to be played with the old school

1371
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:27,600
NES controller. What do you guys think? Is this worth going through the hassle just to

1372
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,600
play with the old school NES controller? Or, forget it, just use the Wii mode. I think

1373
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,600
that sounds like fun. It does not. It sounds like a challenge. And who doesn't love a

1374
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,600
challenge? It sounds like another excuse for G4 to bring out their giant NES controller

1375
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:47,600
to do something stupid on TV. Yippee! Can't wait. Out of curiosity, would this sway you

1376
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,600
to buy this on the Wii, or are you still like, eh, not good enough, I'm still going to get

1377
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,600
it on 360? That's right. That's kind of where I'm at. I'm like, oh that's cute. Well actually,

1378
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:05,600
actually. Cute, but. I may still get it on the Wii. But. I'm still on my silly boycott.

1379
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,600
I have no room. And that's where I stand. I have no room for games. Don't worry, don't

1380
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:14,600
worry Rob. We won't have to purchase it. I will get it on the 360 I'm sure. But I like,

1381
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,600
I like the prospect of being able to use the old controller. Why don't they put it on the

1382
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:22,600
DS? They need to put like another Mega Man collection on the DS and release this along

1383
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:27,600
with it. Do you think Capcom might release a remake of the game later on? I mean, they've

1384
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,600
never done that before. Never ever, right? Do you think there might be a Mega Man 9 Championship

1385
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:39,600
Turbo Edition next year? I doubt it. You never know. You never know. Well, moving forward.

1386
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:46,600
And forward is a good way to move. Konami wants to hop on the, the old school bandwagon.

1387
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:51,600
Because, well everyone else is doing it, why can't they? Well, then again, they were already

1388
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:56,600
doing the Castlevania one, right? Rumored. But, yeah, well here's more rumor. It was

1389
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:06,600
actually in EGM, put up by Wii Fanboy, said that in the September 2008 issue, that there

1390
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:12,600
will be one of the most beloved yet overlooked action-adventure franchises of yore will soon

1391
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:22,600
get a surprise retro-revival sequel. Hmm. It better not be Bomberman. Still a Bomberman,

1392
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:31,600
but we've already had Bomberman. Go Emon! It'll be, um, um, um, what if it was Turtles

1393
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,600
Tournament Fighter? That would be awesome. They lost the Turtles license to EA. That's

1394
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:44,600
right, damn. Or it could be, um, no they lost it, they could be soft. Or it could be, um,

1395
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:52,600
Rocky O'Hare! Gradius, since they already said they were gonna do a Gradius a couple

1396
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:58,600
of weeks ago. Yeah. Who knows. How about a bunch of stuff? How about Blades of Steel?

1397
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,600
I'm gonna pretend you just didn't see that. Do not roll your eyes at me, young lady. I

1398
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:07,600
love Blades of Steel. That was the first NES hockey game where you could actually fight.

1399
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,600
Like, not crappy like ice hockey. I'm talking about punching people in the face. That's

1400
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:17,600
great. And why else should there be hockey in the world? For blood, because blood bounces

1401
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:23,600
on ice. AgDef suggests double dribble. How about Skate or Die? Was that a Konami game?

1402
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,600
I don't think it was. I think, actually. No, Ultra, it was Ultra games. Yeah, yeah. So

1403
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:34,600
that was Skate or Die, hey. Hmm, maybe. We'll see. I don't think they would do that game.

1404
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:40,600
A man can dream. I know. Yeah, that's all, unfortunately, it will ever become. Um, but

1405
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:46,600
here's some games that will be coming at some point, but they have been rated by the ESRB.

1406
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:52,600
Man, you know that ESRB, they still can't quite lock down those games from being announced.

1407
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:58,600
Mega Man 1 and 2 have been spotted on there, as well as Earthworm Jim 2, so that's pretty

1408
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:05,600
cool. Earthworm Jim. Remember the opening to Earthworm Jim? I love that. Some other things,

1409
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:13,600
um, Ys Book 1 and 2 will be coming out, and Samurai Showdown 2. Yes, that was the best

1410
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:22,600
one. Wasn't Ys a CD game? Or am I wrong? I would like to say that Ys Book 1 and 2 came

1411
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:30,600
out on CD, so the two games were released as a single CD. Have we gotten CD games here

1412
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:35,600
yet? Yeah. We have? Oh. They got Dracula X in Japan, didn't they? Yeah, I knew they were

1413
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:40,600
coming, I just didn't know we had any yet. That's awesome. But no, the Ys games are good,

1414
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:46,600
now I won't. Yeah, I might actually, ugh, I don't have room for Ys. You know what, Rob,

1415
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:52,600
I'll tell you what, just come over to my house, we'll hook up the PC Engine. Deal! Anything

1416
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:58,600
else, Loki, coming out? That's it. Alright, I thought there might be more. Well, two games

1417
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:02,600
coming out very soon that people are very much looking forward to. StarCraft II and

1418
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:08,600
Diablo III. Now, you might have heard in last episode or elsewhere around the internet that

1419
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,600
Wrath of the Lich King, the new Warcraft expansion, is going to be getting an achievement system

1420
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:17,600
in the game. Um, achievements for, you know, exploring every zone in the game or completing

1421
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,600
certain quests or beating certain instances or what have you. Well, here's the kind of

1422
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:24,600
interesting thing. Blizzard is creating somewhat of an achievement system of their own because

1423
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:30,600
guess what, StarCraft II and Diablo III, yep, they're going to have achievements as well.

1424
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:37,600
Every achievement earned is going to go towards this Blizzard level that every Blizzard user

1425
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,600
is going to use. You could basically think of it like an Xbox Live type thing where you

1426
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,600
have a gamer score, but now you're going to have a Blizzard level. Definitely a way to

1427
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,600
kind of tie in all the Blizzard universes together. Because you know there's going to

1428
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,600
be plenty of people playing all three. I'm not as huge on StarCraft, I might still check

1429
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:58,600
it out. Plus, William loves StarCraft. I don't know if you know that. He's not that big of

1430
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:03,600
a gamer, but he loves StarCraft. So he is all excited about StarCraft II. So he'll probably

1431
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,600
make me buy that for him. And then Diablo III I'm excited about because I did like Diablo

1432
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:15,600
II quite a bit. Achievement Whore Loki, are you excited? Eh. But you don't really play

1433
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:21,600
Blizzard games on the computer, do you? No, I used to. I used to play like, um, what was

1434
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:26,600
it? I used to play StarCraft, or not StarCraft, World of Warcraft, not World of Warcraft,

1435
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:32,600
Warcraft! The original Warcraft and Diablo. Never played Diablo II though. Should have.

1436
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:37,600
It's interesting. I was just looking at a chat room here. Pooface says, too bad the

1437
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,600
life of a Blizzard game lasts the same of a game console. I don't know, it seems like

1438
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,600
Blizzard games last a long time. There's still people that frickin' play Diablo II like it

1439
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,600
just came out yesterday. Lieutenant Pliskin says, achievements are all the rage these

1440
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:55,600
days. Yeah, kinda. You see trophies now, and pretty soon I'm sure Nintendo will have something

1441
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:03,600
as well, who knows. Well, something else that is pretty, this makes me very, very, very

1442
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:13,600
happy. There is a rumor now that Sega is going to be bringing back the Jet Set Radio games.

1443
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,600
As we know, there was a Dreamcast one, which we actually got as Jet Grind Radio, and then

1444
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:25,600
Xbox had Jet Set Radio Future, and then there was a Jet Set Radio for the Game Boy Advance.

1445
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:33,600
So, there is definite speculation that Sega is going to be bringing this out, but I'll

1446
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:42,600
tell you what's an interesting thing that actually supports this rumor, is that Sega

1447
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:51,600
did file a trademark on July 24th, this year, that's separate from their original filing

1448
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:58,600
for the Jet Set Radio license. Well, I think Jet Set Radio on the Wii would be a pretty

1449
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:02,600
cool thing, don't you? Can you imagine, of course you can do graffiti with the Wii logo.

1450
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:08,600
What if we had it on the iPhone? Too tiny, too tiny. Well, they've been quoted as saying,

1451
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:16,600
well, the president of Sega is quoted as saying that the iPhone is the new Dreamcast. Interesting.

1452
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,600
Could you imagine doing your graffiti with your finger? That would be kind of weird to

1453
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:26,600
me, I don't know. And fun. Yeah, maybe for a little while, but I don't know. I do hope

1454
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:31,600
the rumor is true, though. I don't know if I'd be calling the iPhone the new Dreamcast,

1455
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:36,600
that's not a good thing to compare it to. Well, do you have some more news for us, Loki?

1456
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:46,600
Yeah. Well, this kind of goes back to the whole story about achievements. With all these

1457
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:50,600
different systems coming out with their own achievement and trophy and, you know, whatever

1458
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:55,600
systems, there's actually going to be a new site to track all these at the same time.

1459
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:01,600
It's actually being created by Rooster Teeth, who you may remember from the Red vs. Blue

1460
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:07,600
series, among all their other animated machima series. But now they have a brand new website

1461
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:15,600
that's going to database all these, and that site is, what's it called? Small Rewards.

1462
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:20,600
Achievement Hunter, I'm sorry. That's what it's called. And right now I know that they

1463
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:27,600
were saying that they're going to do the 360, the PS3, and of course the iPhone, and maybe

1464
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:33,600
of course they're going to add on these Blizzard ones as well. So, that's pretty cool. They'll

1465
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,600
have to track all these different sites. I wonder if they're going to have some sort

1466
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:43,600
of way to add them all together or something like that. Is that really necessary?

1467
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,600
Yes, it's very necessary.

1468
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,600
Actually, it is kind of funny. I don't know why.

1469
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,600
It is. I think it's hilarious.

1470
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:54,600
Darktitsuya says, I'm liking the theme music for stories. You know, I once listened to

1471
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,600
a gaming podcast, I don't remember who it was, but they actually play music in the background

1472
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:03,600
the entire show, which is cool because I think they play mostly indie bands and stuff, and

1473
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,600
you know, it makes their show unique, so more power to them, but just kind of funny. I never

1474
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:13,600
thought of doing theme music for stories. I think it would be cool if we could actually,

1475
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,600
when we're talking about a certain game, have the music from the game playing in the background,

1476
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,600
but that takes a lot of coordinated effort, you guys don't even know. I would do it if

1477
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:28,600
we could, but in the meantime, you get Monty Python's Flying Circus.

1478
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:35,600
I don't know what theme music would be appropriate for this. Maybe something about moving on

1479
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,600
or something. Wasn't that a DDR song moving on? Penny Arcade Expo is going to the East

1480
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,600
Coast in 2010. That is the current rumor going around. Actually, it's not really a rumor.

1481
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:49,600
Tycho himself has said that Penny Arcade Expo is going to be going to the East Coast, and

1482
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,600
that doesn't mean that the West Coast show is going to go anywhere. They're turning packs

1483
01:36:53,600 --> 01:37:01,600
into multiple places at multiple times type events. Apparently, it's quoted by, the Penny

1484
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,600
Arcade team has been quoted from saying, frankly, it should be global. An East Coast show is

1485
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,600
only the beginning. So one thing they might announce at Penny Arcade Expo this year is

1486
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:14,600
that there's going to be probably an East Coast show next year, and who knows, maybe

1487
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:24,600
something in Europe? Canada? Who knows? Somewhere maybe outside the US. Hawaii? Australia?

1488
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:30,600
Penny Arcade Expo, Luxembourg. Yes. Penny Arcade, Mozambique. Wouldn't that be fun?

1489
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:39,600
Monaco. To Las Vegas or Monaco, win a fortune in the game. My life would never be the same.

1490
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,600
Rob. Ah yes, let's uh. Let's get this part over with.

1491
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:50,600
Yes, it's the mailbag, kids. Every week you email us. Mailbag at orangelauncherator.com.

1492
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:54,600
Let's open up the mailbag, see what you guys have to say this week.

1493
01:37:54,600 --> 01:38:01,600
Oh, did we ever get some doozies? I got to say doozy. Well first of all, this comes from

1494
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:10,600
Dave. Hi Dave! Hi Dave. You can't do that, Dave. Sorry. Hey OLR crew, great work on the

1495
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:15,600
show. I was wondering if any of you have checked out giantbomb.com, the new website from former

1496
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:21,600
game spotter Jeff Gertsman and company. It's basically a potentially awesome game focused

1497
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,600
wiki. What do you think of it if you've tried it? I'm sure there are tons of randomly awesome

1498
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:32,600
games on Sega systems in its desperate need of Dark Sakura's careful attention. Love the

1499
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:37,600
show and other nice closing pleasantries. Forgive the shit punctuation. Oh, you're forgiven.

1500
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:43,600
Dave from Yeild, England. You're forgiven. Chat room, I'm not stupid. When I said Hawaii

1501
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:49,600
being outside the US, I meant continental US, of course. I'm not dumb. Anyhow, sorry,

1502
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:57,600
email is giantbomb.com. Yes, I actually did visit it and it's sleek. But here's the thing,

1503
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:03,600
if I want game wiki, I usually go to Wikipedia. I'm not exactly sure what is going to make

1504
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,600
me visit this site on a daily basis, which is what it's all about, right? That's just

1505
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:12,600
some friendly feedback. I'm not trying to knock the site or anything because it's rather

1506
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:17,600
slick. It's put together rather well and I think they'll get a lot of listeners and certainly

1507
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,600
they have some knowledgeable people from the gaming industry working for it, but I'm not

1508
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,600
sure there's anything there just yet that's going to make me want to click reload every

1509
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,600
six hours. You know what I mean? But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, okay.

1510
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,600
But there's a lot of neat information on it. Like there's bios that are pretty well written

1511
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,600
for most big people in the game industry and then it ties into the games that they've done.

1512
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:40,600
Um, so if I were looking for specific information that place to go, you know, it does have some

1513
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:44,600
advantages over Wikipedia. I'll give it that. It's not, it's not a bad site by any means

1514
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:53,600
and it's different. It's something different. So props to them. Next. Yes. Our weekly letter

1515
01:39:53,600 --> 01:40:00,600
from cheeseburger. You know, you don't have to read every single email. Yes, I do. All

1516
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:05,600
right. No, mostly. All right. Hey guys, today I got a subscription to Xbox live with a headset

1517
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:10,600
camera and some other stuff including two arcade games. I only have halo three and no

1518
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:14,600
arcade games. So what arcade games do you think I should get? I don't like sports and

1519
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:19,600
have things like Pac-Man be Jordan Zuma on my iPod. Well, if you were listening to part

1520
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,600
a, I would tell you to go right now and get geometry wars retro evolve too, because I

1521
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:26,600
think it's probably the best game on Xbox live arcade right now. There's symphony of

1522
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:32,600
the night. Which is also a great game. Get it. If you don't have a PS1. Get it. Also

1523
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,600
good games. If you like music games, which a lot of our audience does, I don't know where

1524
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:41,600
you stand on that. Not UNO, but Every Extent Extra Extreme, maybe Luminous as well, would

1525
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:47,600
both be good things to look into. Luminous is sweet. If you like music games. If you're

1526
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,600
not so much on music games, if you like role playing games, a penny arcade game is actually

1527
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:55,600
pretty low worthy, although it is a little more pricier. But stay away from some of those

1528
01:40:55,600 --> 01:41:02,600
retro classic change games. I do like the Pac-Man though, tournament edition. Oh god,

1529
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:08,600
yes, thank you chat. Run, do not walk, rez HD. Yeah. Which could also very well be the

1530
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:14,600
best game on Xbox live arcade. It is a virtual tie with Geometry Wars 2. They are both great.

1531
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:19,600
So run, do not walk, rez and Geometry Wars. Pac-Man Championship Edition, honestly. Whether

1532
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,600
you have the original on your iPhone or not, the act-def, I completely agree with that

1533
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,600
act-def just saying in chat. It doesn't matter if you already have the original version,

1534
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:30,600
it's different enough. The only thing better than that though was the GameCube Pac-Man

1535
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:36,600
versus. But you don't get that on Xbox Live, so make do. So next up, Hello Sky, DarkSakura

1536
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:41,600
and Loki. Hello emailer. First things first, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy listening

1537
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,600
to your show. Not all gaming podcasts are created equal, and yours is a testament to

1538
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,600
that. Thank you. That doesn't necessarily mean we're above the rest, the way that's

1539
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:55,600
working. Oh yes we are, hush. So, moving forward, I just wanted to chime in with my opinion

1540
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,600
on Nintendo and this year's E3. As far as I am concerned, the lukewarm reception Nintendo

1541
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:04,600
received was entirely deserving. DarkSakura correctly pointed out that they are a business

1542
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:09,600
and their primary concern is making money, but I fear that their current hard-on for

1543
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:15,600
casual gamer is going to come back and bite them in the ass. The casual market is supporting

1544
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,600
them, but it will not sustain them. The Wii has the lowest attach rate of all the current

1545
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:24,600
gen consoles. The fact remains that it is still the hardcore gamers who are the lifeblood

1546
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:28,600
of the gaming companies. Nintendo has the most loyal fanbase of any of the big three,

1547
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:33,600
but if these hardcore fans are made to feel more and more alienated, not all of the Mario

1548
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,600
and Zelda sequels in the world will keep them from defecting to another camp that can offer

1549
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:42,600
them more. And by more, I mean hassle-free online and disk-based storage. As someone

1550
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:46,600
who grew up with an NES controller in my hands disappoints me to see Nintendo apparently

1551
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:51,600
dropping me for kindergarteners and soccer moms, and I now know I am not alone in this.

1552
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:56,600
Loki will back me up, I'm sure. Keep on rocking like the proverbial hurricane, raw fish and

1553
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:01,600
beer. This email is brought to you by Mixed Metaphors, home of the ass-biting hard-ons.

1554
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:07,600
Really? That's the best home of thing ever.

1555
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,600
Uh, the beat goes on when Nintendo. Beat goes on.

1556
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:16,600
Next up. Hey, O-L-R. Hi. I know Rob is a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and I wanted

1557
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:21,600
to know what his reaction was to the news of MTV creating a remake of the classic film.

1558
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:29,600
If he didn't know yet, I'm sorry to be the bearer of what I see as terrible news. Harry.

1559
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:38,600
Um, yeah, it's, uh, it's, you know, I don't like to judge things until I see them or watch

1560
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:44,600
them or play them or whatever, but in this case, you just kinda know. This has, you know,

1561
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:51,600
remember the old Animaniacs segment? Good idea, bad idea? Bad idea, this right here.

1562
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:58,600
Okay, this is my thought, though. Okay, we saw the redone play, right? Yes. And that

1563
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:09,600
was good. Yeah. What if they had it carry, I guess, the updated music of the new play,

1564
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,600
but keep the feel of the old one? Again, I don't want to judge it until I've seen it.

1565
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,600
A casting choice is very important as, you know, a lot of it that goes into it, and I

1566
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:21,600
don't want to say that everything MTV touches necessarily turns to shit, because, you know,

1567
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:26,600
rock band's cool, but then again, this is the network that brought us the hills. I mean,

1568
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:33,600
shit, enough said, right? This is the network that started reality TV. I think this is kind

1569
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:40,600
of unnecessary, but it's also inevitable at the same time. If it ain't broke, don't remake

1570
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:44,600
it. I liked the idea better five years ago when the rumor was that the guy who did Priscilla

1571
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:48,600
Queen of the Desert was going to be remaking it with Alan Cumming playing Frank-N-Furter.

1572
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:52,600
Oh my god, wouldn't that be great? See, I was totally fine with that. That would just

1573
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:57,600
be... Now we're five years later, and the rumor's a little less cool. So, we'll see.

1574
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:05,600
SSG100Matt says, OLR needs a Wheel of Morality segment. We do! Wheel of Morality, turn, turn,

1575
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:13,600
turn, show us the lesson that we should learn. Love it. Okay, email! Dun dun dun. Yo, OLR,

1576
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:21,600
this be the GS68. Um, yo, dude. Okay. Okay, enough of the speaking in GhettoSpeak. In response

1577
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,600
to Akdeft's call last week, how people who play Rock Band should learn real instruments.

1578
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:30,600
I'd like to say that. Ooh, this is bulleted, too. I'm impressed. People who play One Gun

1579
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:35,600
or Initial D should invest shitloads of money in a real car and then illegally street race

1580
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:40,600
down Highway 101 at 200 miles an hour. People who play Pokeman should capture real animals

1581
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:45,600
and train them. Hi, PETA. Well, that's okay. PETA's a bunch of psycho assholes, anyway.

1582
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:50,600
People who play GTA should learn to hijack cars and kill people in real life. Hi, um,

1583
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:56,600
he who shall not be named. People who play Mulana should explore real life ruins and

1584
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:00,600
get killed in the process. People who play Shoot Em Up should invest in a real space

1585
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:06,600
fighter jet. Oh, wait, those don't exist. That is all, GS68. PS, this email is brought

1586
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:13,600
to you by Tekken, home of the never-ending stages. DJ Ratchet makes a good point going

1587
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:18,600
back to the hills. The hills makes the soup funny. That is true. Without MTV, the soup

1588
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:23,600
would not be nearly as funny. Oh, yes, to that other email. There's more email. Okay,

1589
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:28,600
more email. Um, actually, Robwith2B sent us a couple of stories. Yay! And this one, I

1590
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:38,600
think, is hilarious. It's the top seven irritating female characters in video games. So, if the

1591
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:45,600
stupid ad would ever disappear, because I fucking hate ads. Oh, you know what, I'm about

1592
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:53,600
to just say, screw this, because I hate ads. Stop. Someone's gotta pay the bills. Number

1593
01:46:53,600 --> 01:47:03,600
seven is Ashley Williams from Mass Effect. Um, I don't know, I didn't play Mass Effect.

1594
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:10,600
Six is Minnie Mouse. I guess I'm talking about the- Mickey Mousecapade was awesome. Yeah,

1595
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:20,600
Mickey Mousecapade. Screw whoever wrote that. Ashley Graham from Resident Evil 4. Um, moving

1596
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:35,600
forward. God, the internet sucks. Sorry. Four is, um, Mikiko Ebihara from Daikatana. And

1597
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:51,600
then, um, stupid webpage. Next up is, um, it looks like Catalina from Grand Theft Auto

1598
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:59,600
3. And then the Beggar Lady in Assassin's Creed. And then, um, our last one's on the

1599
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:08,600
list. Number one is Navi from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Hey, listen. Hey, listen.

1600
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:17,600
Hey, listen. Hey, listen. So, uh. Hey, Yuna was not annoying. That was my roommate contributing

1601
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:26,600
there, Yuna. That was awful, she needed to die. No. Wow, I think, that's like the first

1602
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:29,600
time I think my roommate's kind of gotten into the video game discussion here on the

1603
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,600
program. Usually, usually he turns his nose up at the show. He's cooking something that

1604
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,600
smells delightful right outside the door, though. Yeah, what's funny is we have the

1605
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:41,600
tornado bringing out, that's how we finally fixed our air conditioning problem. We bought

1606
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:45,600
a tornado to suck in air conditioning from the house and blow it out here. But tonight,

1607
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:51,600
since the roommate is cooking, it sucks and it blows. His very delightful dish is, uh,

1608
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:56,600
we can smell nothing but that out here because it's sucking air from the kitchen. Anyway,

1609
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:04,600
sorry. So, um, another one from Rob, um, I haven't really read the article, but he said,

1610
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:09,600
um, I got this link in GamePolitics.com, a judge disenfranchises the class in class action

1611
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,600
suit. And, um, it's about the Grand Theft Auto, um, thing. I'll link it in the chat

1612
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:19,600
room. Um, it says, I'm actually a little surprised since the original suit was not over state

1613
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:25,600
laws, but just about getting more than he paid for. I'd rather be broke, be broken by

1614
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:31,600
providing, by proving the class didn't actually exist. So I'd rather it be broken by proving

1615
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:36,600
the class didn't actually exist. I also retract my E3 2008 as boring comment. If you really

1616
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:40,600
dig into the third-party games and the, uh, non-big announcements, there are a lot of

1617
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:45,600
good information. My original opinion was based, um, all on the A-list games news being

1618
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:51,600
leaked to the interwebs. So it was, uh, spoiled for me. Level up, you now have three character

1619
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:56,600
points to apply towards your stats, Rob. With two Bs. And I'm just looking at this article

1620
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:03,600
real quick. Can I put three points in Awesomeness? Hmm. Okay. Um, it said that the settlement

1621
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:10,600
over the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, um, uh, settlement was actually hitting a snag

1622
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:16,600
because they're saying on there that the, those who were to benefit from the, uh, that,

1623
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:22,600
that class that they're referring to actually isn't there. So, because not everybody knew

1624
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:26,600
about it until something came out on the internet. But I'll link this in the chat room. It's

1625
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:32,600
an interesting little article. It's, um, for anyone who's interested, just go to, um, it's

1626
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:37,600
actually on the, uh, New York Times blog is, uh, where I linked it to me in the technology

1627
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:43,600
section. Just look up, um, settlement over sex scenes in Grand Theft Auto hits a snag.

1628
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:49,600
I'll link it in the chat room. That's it. All right. If you want to email us, mailbag

1629
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:56,600
at orangelaungeradio.com. All right. It's dot com. We have a couple more news articles

1630
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,600
for you guys, and then we're going to be opening up the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR, username

1631
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:06,600
on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Yeah, it's not just coincidence. Well, um, it's only

1632
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:11,600
fair since Rock Band's getting really awesome peripherals from a third-party company that

1633
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:17,600
Guitar Hero World Tour will get awesome peripherals from a third-party company. The third-party

1634
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:23,600
company providing these would be Logitech, and of course they already make the USB microphones

1635
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:29,600
that are used by almost, I'd say, almost all of the music games out there right now. And

1636
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:36,600
they're going to be doing some high-end guitars and drum sets as well. No word exactly what

1637
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:41,600
features these will have, but, you know, if it's Logitech, you can probably guess it's

1638
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:47,600
going to be put together at least pretty well. So, um, yeah. I guess we'll just have to

1639
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:56,600
wait and see when they show these off. Uh, yay, more peripherals to put on the Best Buy

1640
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:00,600
shelves and other gaming stores to take up space. Well, these things are damn expensive.

1641
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:07,600
I mean, if it's anything like that $399 drum set, which I do still want, I don't know why

1642
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:12,600
because I don't play Rock Band, but I want it anyways. Speaking of music games, I've

1643
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:16,600
been kind of brainstorming how I would make a game like Beatmania 2DX work, and I've thought

1644
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:21,600
about, like, a game that would combine Beatmania 2DX and Popin' Music. I think it would be

1645
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:28,600
actually kind of cool. I just wish I had a game company to make it for me. Moving on,

1646
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:32,600
not that anyone cares, but Jamie's going to care about this one. This is a news article

1647
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:38,600
just for you, Dark Sakura. Yes, it's about Ragnarok Online. Not just that, but Ragnarok

1648
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:44,600
Online DS. Now, here's the thing. This was announced quite some time ago, and now we're

1649
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:48,600
starting to wonder, is this game ever going to come out? Well, here's the thing. Ragnarok

1650
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:52,600
Online on the DS, it's not actually going to be an MMO. You don't get to play it with

1651
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:55,600
other people. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be. Right, and that kind of makes sense, but

1652
01:52:55,600 --> 01:53:00,600
it is going to be a single-player role-playing game that apparently has some online features

1653
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:06,600
in it, whatever that means. Some screenshots have come out for the game this week as well,

1654
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,600
and it does have that same chibi style that you've come to know and love from the original

1655
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:14,600
Ragnarok Online. I looked at the pictures and I saw a bunny band. Apparently you do

1656
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:18,600
have gestural attack inputs. You use the stylus to kind of draw your attacks and things like

1657
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:24,600
that. December 18th is the day this comes out overseas. Import! Yep, I bet you will.

1658
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:28,600
You know I will. I know you will. Whether or not I can read most of it or not. You know

1659
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:33,600
what I know will happen right now is that we are going to open up the Skype line at

1660
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:38,600
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and we're going to take a few calls

1661
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:42,600
here on this Part B of our show tonight. We actually kind of jammed through the stories

1662
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:46,600
part of our show tonight. It's only about 815 on the West Coast. That's not bad! Because

1663
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:50,600
here we've got a 10 minute late start tonight. Oh, I thought you said on the East Coast,

1664
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:54,600
I'm like, wait, what? No, no, no, 815 here, but usually we don't get to the Skype line

1665
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:59,600
until like 9 o'clock, so we're doing good tonight. 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype,

1666
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:02,600
Orange Lounge Radio, it's not ringing right now, so Loki, do you have any last minute,

1667
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:06,600
or I should start with Dark Soccer, do you have any last minute stories for us? Um, no,

1668
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:13,600
not really. Uh, Loki? Um, I haven't really been looking at last minute stories. Oh, here's

1669
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:20,600
some, yay. Um, Sony's Life, you may remember that, um, as the, their version of the globe

1670
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:27,600
spinning news thing, so that's not coming out right away. It's been delayed. Wow, surprise.

1671
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:34,600
Sony delaying something? Yeah. Anyways. Rock Band, download content. We've got some stuff

1672
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:39,600
coming out this week, including, uh, Crewfest Pack 2, and we're going to be getting with

1673
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:45,600
that, uh, Face Down in the Dirt by Motley Crue for 80 points or a dollar. Um, Rescue

1674
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:52,600
Me by Buck Cherry, another 80 points or a dollar, and Life is Beautiful by 6 AM, and

1675
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:57,600
that's also 80 points or a dollar, whole pack for 240 or 3 bucks. And then each, um, they're

1676
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:02,600
going to have individual songs for BYOB from System of a Down for 2 bucks, and Toxicity

1677
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:07,600
from System of a Down, also 2 bucks, and you might remember those were part of the System

1678
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:13,600
of a Down exclusive download content for when you, um, bought their album, so that's kind

1679
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:21,600
of interesting. And, um, you remember there's a game coming out called Last Guy on the PlayStation

1680
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:25,600
Network, and what's interesting about this game is it's actually very similar to a game

1681
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:29,600
that came out on WTF, the PSP game. Well, they have a website where you can play it

1682
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:35,600
on any URL, which is kind of cool, and of course it's lastguy.jp, go there and you can...

1683
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:36,600
Does it work on our own website?

1684
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:37,600
It'll work on any website.

1685
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,600
Would it be fun on our website?

1686
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,600
Um...

1687
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:41,600
Let's check it out.

1688
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:44,600
Yeah, lastguy.jp.

1689
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:46,600
Alright.

1690
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:47,600
And, uh...

1691
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:51,600
Skypline's open and no one's calling, that's weird. I just checked it to make sure it works.

1692
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,600
I called 1877 Game OLR. Well, it happens sometimes.

1693
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,600
Yeah, because I was...

1694
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:56,600
I was supposed to just quiet.

1695
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:00,600
I was supposed to be looking up, um, you know, stories, but I was working on trying to get

1696
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:04,600
the Wiimotes to work with that Love is Blind game, you know, the one that makes the sex

1697
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,600
noises, but, uh...

1698
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:11,600
Apparently my Bluetooth adapter says, fuck you, Wiimote, I ain't working with you, bitch.

1699
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:12,600
And so...

1700
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,600
Aw, so now we get to play the chat, uh, the sex game?

1701
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,600
No, we can, we can. They have a keyboard version too, so...

1702
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:19,600
Oh, well, hooray.

1703
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,600
It's just not quite, you know, as...

1704
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:22,600
That's a little bonus thing after the show, right?

1705
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,600
Yes.

1706
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:24,600
Okay, that sounds good.

1707
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:29,600
I found, by accident, I found a funny MMO that's, um, all about, uh, getting laid.

1708
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,600
And partying.

1709
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:32,600
Right.

1710
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:35,600
It's like some sort of social networking thing, but I thought it was hilarious.

1711
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:37,600
It was called Red Light Center.

1712
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:39,600
I just thought it was funny.

1713
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,600
I don't think I'm going to play it, but I think it was funny.

1714
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:46,600
Yeah, so, um...

1715
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,600
Yeah, that's pretty much...

1716
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:52,600
The only other story I had was Ubisoft's localizing Armored Core 4 answer for the US,

1717
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:54,600
and it should be coming out in September.

1718
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:56,600
And that's kind of cool, I guess.

1719
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:59,600
Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by Armored Core 4.

1720
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,600
I don't know if I'll pick this up.

1721
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:02,600
Probably not.

1722
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,600
But...

1723
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:05,600
I don't know.

1724
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:06,600
Can't get too excited anymore.

1725
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:07,600
I used to love Armored Core games.

1726
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:10,600
I used to buy every single one that came out, but...

1727
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:11,600
Oh, well.

1728
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:15,600
Oh, I guess I did miss a game that was supposed to be coming out on the Wii and DS this week.

1729
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:18,600
Little League World Series 2008.

1730
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:19,600
I know. Sad.

1731
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:21,600
Oh, and this week on Xbox Live Arcade.

1732
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:24,600
We've got Braid for, like, 15 bucks.

1733
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:25,600
Is that game supposed to be cool?

1734
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:26,600
It looks kind of neat from the previews.

1735
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:27,600
It's supposed to be pretty cool.

1736
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:28,600
You can kind of, like, it's...

1737
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:32,600
Imagine, like, a 2D platform game with the sands of time built into it.

1738
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:33,600
All right.

1739
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:35,600
Finally, our phone's ringing.

1740
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:36,600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1741
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:37,600
Who's this?

1742
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:39,600
It's a dead, tired Rama.

1743
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:40,600
Hey, Rama.

1744
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:44,600
You know, and I'm kind of glad somebody called, even if, you know, you call us quite often.

1745
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:46,600
Are you looking at Justin.tv, by the way?

1746
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:52,600
Actually, I'm not because I just got off the bus ride from hell about 40 minutes ago.

1747
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:56,600
I'm wearing your shirt that you got when you were out here in California, the one you bought.

1748
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:58,600
Give me a second.

1749
01:57:58,600 --> 01:58:00,600
Let me fire it up and see what you got over there.

1750
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:01,600
Well, no rush.

1751
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:03,600
I'll still be here after we hang up.

1752
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:04,600
What's on your mind?

1753
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:07,600
You went to a con because you've been sending me pictures.

1754
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,600
Yeah, did you like the pictures I sent?

1755
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,600
Yes, they're really hard to see on my phone.

1756
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:15,600
I liked them because you sent me Knights or Riala, one of them.

1757
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:16,600
I think I sent you both.

1758
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,600
I got a Frank-N-Furter one.

1759
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,600
I know.

1760
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,600
I see Scott.

1761
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:23,600
I also got a Bubble Bobble.

1762
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:24,600
Heart.

1763
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:25,600
There you go.

1764
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:26,600
Heart.

1765
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,600
Right, I heart and why.

1766
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:28,600
There you have it.

1767
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:30,600
All right, so how was the con?

1768
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,600
What con was it you went to?

1769
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:33,600
It was called what?

1770
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,600
Kinetic Con.

1771
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:35,600
Kinetic Con.

1772
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:37,600
How was that?

1773
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:40,600
Much better than I thought it was.

1774
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:45,600
It gave me a Fonami feel to it, so you know what that means, I'll be going back to that convention next year.

1775
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:47,600
Fonami is a good time.

1776
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:52,600
Fonami is a great con.

1777
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:58,600
I got there late Friday night because I had to work and I missed my bus, but I got there Saturday.

1778
01:58:58,600 --> 01:58:59,600
I left my camera.

1779
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:01,600
It showed up an hour later.

1780
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:06,600
It wasn't as packed, but it was just really roomy, really flowing.

1781
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:10,600
And then when I got to the room, my roommate tells me, oh, there's going to be furries here.

1782
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:12,600
What?

1783
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:15,600
That was exactly my reaction.

1784
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:20,600
Correct me if I'm wrong, Rama, but did you not say that you missed the bus?

1785
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:22,600
Yeah, getting Friday I missed the bus.

1786
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:27,600
I was stuck waiting at Greyhound for almost an hour to get my ticket changed.

1787
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:30,600
Ha ha ha ha.

1788
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:34,600
I see what you did there, sir.

1789
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,600
I missed the bus.

1790
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:37,600
I couldn't help it, I'm sorry.

1791
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:41,600
I know it's probably not funny, but in years you'll look back and laugh at it.

1792
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,600
It's all good, man.

1793
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:46,600
It's all good.

1794
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:52,600
Well, I have to ask, what gaming things were going on at the convention?

1795
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:55,600
Would you believe I saw DDR?

1796
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:56,600
At an anime convention?

1797
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,600
DDR you don't say?

1798
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:01,600
First I was seen in like five cons.

1799
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:03,600
Was there Smash Brothers?

1800
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,600
Yes, there was.

1801
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,600
I'll be damned.

1802
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:11,600
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. Was there Guitar Hero?

1803
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:12,600
Yes, there was.

1804
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,600
I'm on a fucking roll. Look at this. I'm like the psychic con man.

1805
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:16,600
Here's the fun thing to ask was if there was...

1806
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:20,600
Was there a Naruto game?

1807
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:23,600
Actually, not in the dealer's room.

1808
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:27,600
One of the gaming dealers was showing off one of the Naruto games for PlayStation 2.

1809
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,600
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1810
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:33,600
Psychic con man, hold on, hold on.

1811
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:41,600
Was there a woman overweight dressed to Sailor Moon?

1812
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,600
No.

1813
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,600
Ah, I lose.

1814
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:48,600
That's impossible. That's a prerequisite for any con.

1815
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:51,600
Did you have Manfay? I miss Manfay.

1816
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:54,600
God, no. I think we shoot him.

1817
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:58,600
All right. Anything else you want to share with the listeners, Rama?

1818
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:01,600
There was beat mania, I tell you that much.

1819
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:03,600
Oh, all right.

1820
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:10,600
And one thing I loved about the con was they had a place set up in the convention where you could actually sit down and eat on tables.

1821
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:17,600
Wow. Ooh, Frisbee asked a good question. Was there an overweight man dressed to Sailor Moon?

1822
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:21,600
Actually, no. Believe it or not, there really wasn't any overweight people.

1823
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:24,600
There was, but most of them were wearing Lolita outfits.

1824
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:25,600
Con fails.

1825
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:26,600
Con fails.

1826
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:32,600
Metacon is a combination of a, it's a majority of a webcomic convention with anime, sci-fi, fantasy.

1827
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:34,600
That sounds like fun.

1828
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:35,600
Yeah, it does.

1829
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:38,600
I forget his name, but the guy that played Neelix on Voyager was there as well.

1830
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:39,600
Cool.

1831
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,600
Ethan something isn't his name?

1832
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:41,600
I wanted his own.

1833
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:42,600
Yes.

1834
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:44,600
You didn't give me his autograph, did you?

1835
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,600
I had no money.

1836
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:50,600
I didn't even know he was there until I showed up Saturday.

1837
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,600
Okay, I forgive you.

1838
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,600
There's a, you know, if you go to...

1839
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:57,600
You didn't give me your ominous autograph. I mean, that shouldn't be something.

1840
02:01:57,600 --> 02:02:00,600
I know, I found my book. Finally, I found my book.

1841
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:01,600
Woot.

1842
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,600
Yes, dear Richard, there was anime. Tons of it.

1843
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:06,600
I'll be sending you my book.

1844
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:08,600
Rama, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, okay?

1845
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,600
You too, all right.

1846
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:10,600
Later.

1847
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:12,600
That's great.

1848
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:14,600
Something tells me the callers are fairly apathetic tonight.

1849
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:17,600
Thank you, Ethan Phillips is his game guru. That's his name.

1850
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,600
The other one, you know what, Tuvok is from Sacramento, so you sometimes catch,

1851
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:23,600
I've never seen him, but I see stories about him on the local news once in a while.

1852
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:27,600
You know, celebrity Tim something, what's his name?

1853
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:29,600
Tim something?

1854
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:31,600
What the hell is Tuvok's name? I don't remember.

1855
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:32,600
Oh well.

1856
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,600
Let's go to the phone so we have another call.

1857
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

1858
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,600
Oh my god, we got through.

1859
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:38,600
Yes, we did.

1860
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:39,600
Hi.

1861
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:41,600
Whoa, we've got like a party chat on the line.

1862
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,600
Introduce yourselves.

1863
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,600
Wow, this is like a party line from like the 80s or something.

1864
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:47,600
I know.

1865
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:48,600
Let's call anything.

1866
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:50,600
It's party chat.

1867
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,600
We should meet up at Chuck E. Cheese afterwards.

1868
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:55,600
Who's on the line?

1869
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:59,600
We've got Toshin, Footy Monster, Jack Ransom, and the Rod D.

1870
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:02,600
Wow, it's like an all-games party line.

1871
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:03,600
It is a party line.

1872
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:04,600
Awesome.

1873
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:05,600
Call 1-900.

1874
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,600
Here to call.

1875
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:07,600
1-900.

1876
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:09,600
I'm around, it's always a party. That's the way it rolls.

1877
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:12,600
What do we owe this phone call tonight?

1878
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:15,600
I just wanted to say I beat your deadline score on Geometry Wars and you're going down.

1879
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:16,600
F you.

1880
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:19,600
F you.

1881
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,600
I just did, like five seconds ago.

1882
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:25,600
Geometry Wars brings out the most competitive in all of us, doesn't it?

1883
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:26,600
Yeah.

1884
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:27,600
How about my pacifism score?

1885
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:28,600
It's Geometry Wars, baby.

1886
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:32,600
Dude, I played pacifism for an hour trying to get that stupid wax off achievement.

1887
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:34,600
Have you beat my pacifism score?

1888
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:36,600
Um, I don't think so.

1889
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:39,600
Well, at least I'm still cool at something.

1890
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:43,600
Yeah, but I bumped up my, uh, I know everybody's probably shut up about Geometry Wars,

1891
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:46,600
but I'm up to five million for my deadline.

1892
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:49,600
Did you hear about the Easter egg in Geometry Wars,

1893
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:51,600
that at any point during the game you don't even have to pause it?

1894
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:55,600
You just hit the right bumper and back, and then if you use the sticks,

1895
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:58,600
the both analog sticks, the game is rendered in 3D.

1896
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:00,600
It's crazy.

1897
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:03,600
It's so crazy, like, you don't pause the game at all,

1898
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:06,600
just while you're playing it hit the right bumper, not the trigger, but the bumper,

1899
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:09,600
hit right bumper and the back button, and you can, like, render the field in 3D.

1900
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,600
It's so cool.

1901
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:13,600
And then if you touch the dot in the room with the dragon ducks,

1902
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:16,600
then you can see, created by Warren Robinette, and it's awesome.

1903
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:18,600
It's like that.

1904
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:20,600
Oh, God.

1905
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:21,600
But in 3D, dude.

1906
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:22,600
That's awesome.

1907
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:23,600
3D.

1908
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:25,600
How do you get, how do you go back?

1909
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:27,600
Because now it's in the moment of my game.

1910
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:29,600
Uh, hit right bumper and back again.

1911
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:31,600
Okay, oh, okay, there we go.

1912
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:33,600
Wow, you're playing Geometry Wars while you talk to us?

1913
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:34,600
That's very impressive.

1914
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:35,600
I know.

1915
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:37,600
So what about the other folks on the line?

1916
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:39,600
He's a savant of Geometry Wars.

1917
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:42,600
Are you guys playing Geometry Wars, or are you guys playing?

1918
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:47,600
Well, I can't play anything anymore, because my 360 died after five months,

1919
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:48,600
so I can't play anything.

1920
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:50,600
So, nephew of the week.

1921
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:53,600
Being in Argentina, you're kind of screwed, huh?

1922
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:54,600
I'm totally screwed.

1923
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:57,600
I called Microsoft, they said basically, well, fuck you, we don't care.

1924
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:59,600
And, uh, yeah.

1925
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,600
So I'm out of 500 bucks and a 360.

1926
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:02,600
It's awesome.

1927
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:03,600
That sucks.

1928
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:05,600
That is crappy customer service.

1929
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:07,600
I mean, I understand you're at a regional, I didn't really do business with it.

1930
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:10,600
I tried, I tried messaging, like, through Twitter to Major Nelson.

1931
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:12,600
He tried my luck there.

1932
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:13,600
Of course, nothing happened.

1933
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:16,600
Well, yeah, he probably gets 500 emails a day.

1934
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:17,600
Sucks, though.

1935
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:20,600
I will say this before I end my part of talking here,

1936
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:23,600
because I know you probably have a lot more calls to take.

1937
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,600
Actually, not really tonight.

1938
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:28,600
But, uh, Rhythm Heaven or Rhythm Tengoku Gold on the DS,

1939
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:30,600
you guys need to play that.

1940
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:36,600
I know there's a lot of rhythm fans, you know, in the audience, rhythm game fans.

1941
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,600
You need to play that.

1942
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:41,600
It's like the WarioWare game of rhythm games, and it's so fun.

1943
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:42,600
Ooh, I like WarioWare.

1944
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:45,600
Tell us really quickly, is that what the game's like, WarioWare?

1945
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:51,600
It's, yeah, I imagine, uh, each stage, four, five minigames per stage,

1946
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,600
with a final stage being a remix,

1947
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:58,600
each game is totally different in gameplay, and it's a small song, or a small thingy.

1948
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:01,600
And from that, you advance the remix stage,

1949
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:05,600
and in the remix you play all those minigames crumpled together into one cohesive song.

1950
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:08,600
So you gotta switch gameplays on the fly all the time.

1951
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:11,600
And it goes like that for many, many levels, and it's so fun.

1952
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:17,600
Great music, really catchy, the action on the stylus works perfectly, and it's so fun.

1953
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:20,600
Alright, sounds pretty cool, I will have to look at that.

1954
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:27,600
Yeah, I've just been playing an old copy of Super Robot Wars Alpha I got from a friend a while ago,

1955
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:31,600
since I'll be going to Otacon next week to see Jam Project.

1956
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:34,600
And actually, I'm gonna meet up with Rama, probably.

1957
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:38,600
He didn't even know it was too lame to go, even though Rama and I offered to pay his way.

1958
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:41,600
Aww. What?

1959
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:42,600
Yep.

1960
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:45,600
Sorry, I have to reflect on that. That's horrible.

1961
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:49,600
What about games you've been playing, JackRansom?

1962
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:54,600
Well, my PSP miraculously, after a year and a half, fixed itself this weekend,

1963
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:57,600
so I decided I'd go out and pick up Patapon.

1964
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:59,600
Pata-pata-pata-pon!

1965
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:02,600
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom. That game is nuts!

1966
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:06,600
Oh, my friend is freaking nuts, and I absolutely love it.

1967
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:09,600
I actually got how many goddamn great games there were on the PSP.

1968
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:13,600
You start hearing those little drum beats in your sleep if you've played that game long enough.

1969
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:15,600
It's terrible. You're lying there, trying to go to sleep, and then,

1970
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:19,600
PON PON PATA PON PON PON PON PON PON PON PON.

1971
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:22,600
I cannot wait to get to that stage, because at the moment, I need more of that game.

1972
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:25,600
I want more of that game. I'm loving it.

1973
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:28,600
Hooray for a PSP getting a lot of good games lately. It's great.

1974
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:29,600
Certainly.

1975
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:30,600
All right, well, guys...

1976
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:31,600
Hooray for the Summer of Arcade...

1977
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:33,600
Sorry, go ahead, Toushin, real quick.

1978
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:37,600
I said Summer of Arcade for Xbox Live. I'm going to be broke. That's all I'm saying.

1979
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:41,600
For real. I don't know about that Braid game. I'll have to check out the demo first, because I haven't heard much about it.

1980
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:42,600
I'm skipping that.

1981
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:45,600
But the rest of that looks great. I know, I'm going to be broke.

1982
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:50,600
Playing Bionic Force next week. Galaga Legion's the next. I need money.

1983
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:53,600
You know what, though? If you add it all up, it's the price of, like, Soul Calibur IV.

1984
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:55,600
So, honestly, it's, you know...

1985
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:59,600
That also kicks ass. I highly recommend that for all the Soul Calibur fans.

1986
02:07:59,600 --> 02:08:01,600
Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD coming.

1987
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:03,600
Oh, yes. Hopefully soon.

1988
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:07,600
Toushin, we need to play custom characters in Soul Calibur IV. Soon.

1989
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:09,600
You going to be around later? Because I'm around.

1990
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:13,600
I might. I have a wow date after the show, but maybe later.

1991
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,600
We'll talk.

1992
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:17,600
All right. Take care, guys. I've got to let you go. We're going to wrap up the show. Have a good one, though.

1993
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:18,600
All right.

1994
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:20,600
Bye, Party Chat.

1995
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:23,600
That's great.

1996
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:28,600
It's like we leveled up together. It was a party adventure.

1997
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:32,600
All right. We're going to go around to this point and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap it up for tonight.

1998
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:34,600
Let's go ahead and start with...

1999
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:37,600
And when I say a wow date, I don't mean, like, I'm literally going on a date in wow.

2000
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:40,600
I mean, I have an appointment or whatever you want to call it.

2001
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:42,600
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

2002
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:43,600
Ouch.

2003
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:47,600
My final thought is paper cuts really suck.

2004
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:49,600
Loki, your final thought?

2005
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:53,600
Red Bull BC one's actually pretty good on the DS.

2006
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:55,600
All right.

2007
02:08:55,600 --> 02:09:00,600
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading Orange Launch Radio Independent Podcasting.

2008
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:06,600
Remember, the only way we survive is that you guys tell two friends about our show and the word continues to travel throughout the galaxy.

2009
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:09,600
And one day, Yoda and Darth Vader will be in our show.

2010
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:11,600
Or not.

2011
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:13,600
But anyhow, tune in. We'll be back next week.

2012
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:15,600
It's two weeks that we're going to be off.

2013
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:16,600
Next week, we will be back here.

2014
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:20,600
The All Games Listener Appreciation Month should be in full swing by next week.

2015
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:24,600
I can tell you there will be a prize token given away to live listeners.

2016
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:27,600
We will also have a way you can enter over email, so stay tuned for that.

2017
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:28,600
It's going to be a lot of fun.

2018
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:33,600
And we'll be seeing those of you that are going to PAX four weeks away, if you can believe it.

2019
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:35,600
We're going to PAX.

2020
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,600
We're going to have some seafood and maybe play some video games.

2021
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:39,600
And?

2022
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:40,600
And.

2023
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:41,600
I have to look around the city.

2024
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:43,600
And we need some coffee.

2025
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:44,600
Lots of it.

2026
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:47,600
And we are going to be going to Space Needle at some point.

2027
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:48,600
Yes.

2028
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:49,600
I have to.

2029
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:50,600
And I want it to rain.

2030
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:51,600
And I'm going to try to push Loki off the Space Needle.

2031
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:52,600
And I want it to rain.

2032
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,600
Yes.

2033
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:54,600
Come on, Loki.

2034
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:55,600
Sounds awesome.

2035
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:56,600
Alright.

2036
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:57,600
Alright, have a good one everybody.

2037
02:09:57,600 --> 02:09:58,600
Thank you so much.

2038
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:23,600
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2039
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:30,600
See you next week.
