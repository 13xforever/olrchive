Tonight, August 3, 2008, will Nintendo's latest move in court stop DS piracy?
Is Jet Set Radio making a comeback on the Wii?
And rumors abound about the Xbox 360 getting a price cut next month.
Hello everybody out there on the internet.
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts.
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Roar.
Roar.
Beware, I hunger.
No, I'm not hunger.
I'm full of tasty epic salad.
So then we should not beware.
We should be... Oh, you should beware.
Beware of what?
Beware of what?
Um...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
My mistake.
No, I don't think a milkshake is a part of a good diet.
Actually, milkshakes can be very good for you if you do them right.
Well, I doubt Jack in the Box does them the healthy way.
Call it a hunch.
With no sugar added ice cream and protein powder and low fat milk.
Then it's only half bad.
It's very healthy.
Give good dairy.
I just finished my nutrition class.
Orange Lounge Foodio, everybody.
Welcome to it.
Anyhow, let's talk about games.
We always start off the show with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week.
First, though, let me introduce the one and only chat room.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be if you're listening live on this Sunday evening, August 3rd of 2008, for our 290th show.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Pretty, yes.
Rob, this has been the last week of class.
It's a fair question, yes or no?
No.
This has been the last week of class for me, so I actually took my final on Saturday morning and then played.
I took a hooky day, though.
What'd you do with hooky day?
Watched movies.
But you didn't play Soul Calibur, fail.
No, I didn't.
I'm just kidding.
But, but, but, but, but, I did play some Portal.
And how was that?
Portal-rific.
All right.
And, of course, Ragnarok.
I have a story just for you later tonight.
I downloaded a game for my phone.
I downloaded a Sudoku game.
I've been playing Sudoku on my phone.
Why?
How bored have you been on a scale of 1 to 10?
It's actually kind of fun.
Keep in mind you can only use each number once.
It's actually kind of fun.
Just for something when you've got three minutes to kill.
Sudoku is a huge time waster.
But that's it.
It's a time waster.
If you're looking to waste time, at least try to put your brain to work, right?
I guess that's what most any game's for, right?
I don't know.
What about this show?
Hey, wait a minute.
Is that it for your gaming week?
Yes, Rob.
Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?
I didn't play that many games this week, actually.
I only played Grand Theft Auto 4.
I meant to play a bunch of stuff this week, but never got around to it.
Grand Theft Auto 4 and...
The Shit Game, but we'll talk about that later.
All right.
It's so much fun.
Thanks for watching!
have the bonus characters, Yoda and Starkiller.
You can't use them, or the Apprentice, as he's called in the game, which makes him sound like a Donald Trump flunky.
But Starkiller from The Force Unleashed, you can't customize characters based off of them, which sucks.
Because I would have loved to have made... I can understand Yoda, because it's kind of hard to base characters off Yoda, unless you can have midget fighters.
Which would be an awesome fighting game, by the way.
I was just thinking that you should totally make your Final Fantasy XI character, Lil' Kim...
I could, but only if I could do Yoda, because she was very tiny.
That's what I was going to say.
I mean, if you could do the midget size.
Well, I made Sassy Pants, my Warcraft character.
I made her based off Young Sung.
She's the chick with the giant afro, and she's quite sassy.
And very cool.
And I also made a male guy based off of... He kind of looks like Robin from the old school, because he has the little mask and very vibrant colors.
But he's based off of Tira, who's the hula hoop girl.
Yeah.
I love customization modes.
It's great.
That's the only reason why I would play wrestling games.
To make my own character.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But no, we had a lot of fun playing Soul Calibur.
Here's the things I don't like about Soul Calibur.
I actually like the Star Wars characters.
I don't know why people are so like, oh, they throw things off balance.
I've never been that hardcore into Soul Calibur, so I don't study the game mechanics or the science.
I think it's fun.
Deal.
I especially think Starkiller is a great, great character.
I love playing as him.
So he's awesome to get in the game.
By the way, if you want to unlock him, you have to...
Beat Arcade Mode with Yoda or I imagine Vader on the 360.
So there you have it.
I think he's a great addition on the PS3.
So I like playing as him.
I like the new characters.
What I don't like, I don't like the single player modes.
Story mode is very, very short, which is fine because it doesn't need to go on forever.
But climbing the tower up and down mode, which is basically just an excuse to fight five people all at once in a row and unlock...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I am hearing, and I do see it a little bit, that some of the game mechanics of some of the old characters kind of got screwed up a little bit.
Like, for instance, Shaoran in chat, Shaoran, sorry, says Talim got slightly less hot between 2 and 3, and she plays a little different, too.
And Ivy, I noticed, especially, plays, like, different.
It's hard to explain.
But some characters I still have a lot of fun with, like Zalasamel.
I love him.
He's awesome.
I want to make one that's more foul than Voldo.
It's probably possible.
Here's the other interesting thing about the Soul Calibur.
The online content, some of it is available and you can download for just 100 Microsoft points.
You can get some extra customization, which is basically like old costumes.
And the cool thing is you can actually customize the existing characters, like change the colors of their outfits and stuff.
So that's kind of neat.
It is pay to unlock content, though.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 on the Xbox 360
Which, I would say, is the best game on Xbox Live Arcade right now.
I think it's great.
And even though they upped the price from $5 to $10, I think it's a heck of a deal because you get six different modes in the game.
I have been playing pacifism mode so much.
Like, that mode is fun, and it's weird because you don't even shoot in that mode.
You just fly around the screen dodging enemies.
But it's so disgustingly simple, like the old Atari 2600 games and the old 80s games that was just, you know, shoot things, don't get hit.
That's it.
It's so simple.
That's one of the reasons I think I love Geometry Wars, is it really kind of, kind of...
I don't know, kind of recalls those days of the past with these very simple video games.
And you practically have like six different games in a way kind of in there.
And I really like the way they've incorporated the leaderboard into the game.
They've basically made the game all about beating your friends.
The achievements are interesting.
They're a lot easier to get than they were in Geometry Wars 1.
But like, you know, like for instance, there's these two achievements, Wax On and Wax Off.
And you do it in pacifism mode.
And you...
Wax On is circling around the screen touching every wall.
But as you start to do it, then the game realizes you're going through the achievement and it starts lighting up the wall on how much of it you've circled.
And then Wax Off is doing the same thing twice, which is kind of hard to do when pacifism mode gets going.
So I
I was pretty impressed by how they kind of worked in the achievements.
I like that they made it very competitive with a friend's leaderboard.
And I got to try multiplayer, which sadly is not on Xbox Live because we all know that's what they're going to do for Retro Evolved 3, I'm sure, to make that fresh.
Retro Evolved 2
I think it's great.
I highly recommend Geometry Wars 2.
If you even like shooters in the slightest, it's a great deal at $10.
I know the price went up, but you get six different games now.
It's worth it.
Check it out.
Highly, highly recommend.
so that's besides Final Fantasy 4 and Warcraft and the usual affair that's pretty much it for my gaming week but those two are the new new games I've been playing looking at comments in the chat room GS68 says Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 sequence mode is reminding me of Giga Wing Son of Dad says Giga Wing should be on Xbox Live Arcade along with Mars Matrix as if there weren't enough shooters on Xbox Live Arcade Mars Matrix was a cool game though
I don't know much about that.
You're going to have to... I've got it somewhere.
I'll have to hook up the Dreamcast.
All right.
You'll have to do that.
Anyhow, let's talk about a little bit of housekeeping tonight.
First off in housekeeping, it is All Games Listener Appreciation Month.
And during All Games Listener Appreciation Month, we're going to be giving away free shit to our listeners.
Here's the thing, you're going to win tokens this month that will allow you to basically kind of enter a larger contest going on at allgames.com where you can win prizes.
They're talking about giving away like game systems and games.
Thanks for watching!
We will not be live in two weeks since this is housekeeping.
There will be no live show Sunday, August 17th.
This is the first time actually the folks in studio are hearing about this too.
Surprise, Loki and DarkSakura.
I heard about it earlier.
Well, because you were here nice and early this week.
That's because I was.
So I got to fill you in, but Loki ran through the door at the last minute and I neglected to tell him.
Last minute, but like a half an hour.
Well, I forgot.
I forgot.
Here's the thing.
I don't talk about my personal life too much, but this is too funny to pass up.
I've been seeing William for a year and a half now.
The thing about William and I is that we're both really big nerds.
We actually spent our first anniversary, we actually drove down to Long Beach and went to the Star Trek tour at the Queen Mary.
That's how big nerds we are.
Here's the thing.
We've always talked about how we're going to go to the Star Trek experience because I haven't been since I was 25.
Right before I started working at my current job, so it was about seven years ago.
So it was a long time ago when I was last at the Star Trek experience.
And we keep talking about how we're going to go back, we're going to go back, because I've never ridden the Borg 4D ride.
Well, then I read on the internet last night they are shutting down the Star Trek experience on September 1st.
Which is so sad.
I don't know why they would shut that down.
It's so cool.
So it really lit a fire under our ass to go to the Star Trek experience before it closes.
But because of Penny Arcade Expo, because of some other commitment I have in Reno in three weeks, because of the fact there's a huge convention in Vegas next week, it really only made sense.
We have to go to Vegas in two weeks.
So we booked a trip and we're going to Vegas in two weeks.
Very last minute trip.
Thank you to the...
Various websites online.
So, yes, I am a giant nerd going to the Star Trek experience in Vegas in two weeks.
So there won't be a live show.
We might pre-tape something.
I don't know yet.
Nerd.
So what?
By the way, for the record, folks, the first thing that DarkSakura said to me, I want to go.
I do.
I do not want to go.
I haven't been on the Borg ride.
Bobby Blackwolf says they're shutting it down because Star Trek is irrelevant these days.
Bite your tongue.
There's that new movie coming out.
That's an awful thing to say.
You take that back.
You take that back, Bobby Blackwolf.
Alright.
So I'll be in Vegas.
Blackwolf says, I actually tried to see if I could get to Vegas this month too.
Because I've never seen the Star Trek experience.
Ha!
Anyhow, so two weeks and we'll fill you in more on what's going to happen that week.
I don't know if DarkSakura and Loki are going to do a show or if we'll pre-tape something or what we're going to do.
So we'll see.
I'll just burn things live on air.
Awesome.
The Burnination Show.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Or the Fuck Show.
No, you can't do the Fuck Show without me.
We can't do the Fuck Show.
Huh?
We can't do the Fuck Show until we're all here.
No, you can't do it without me.
You can't do it without me.
Alright, that's it for pretty much housekeeping.
Otherwise, join our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio.
Join our Facebook, OL Army, our live journal, Orange Lounge.
Where else are we, Social Horde?
Oh, we have a new one!
If you check out the Orange Lounge Radio forums, the OL Archive has been built.
It's this, I don't know, they use SkyDrive or some website where you can share masses of big files.
And because I am a generous, nice, kind, giving person, I actually uploaded 20 old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.
Old, moldy, stanky episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, like episode 20 through 40, I think, are up there on the OL Archive.
along with some other old school Orange Lens Radio stuff.
I'm going to warn you in advance, it was a much different show five years ago.
So, be warned.
If you're expecting the same stuff you hear now, it's even worse, if you can believe it.
So there you have it, the OL Archive.
More information available in our forums.
Alright, enough whoring ourselves out, let's get to some gaming news.
Yes, this week Nintendo, along with 54 other developers, filed lawsuit against or
I don't know, a lawsuit against the makers of the R4 device.
As well as, I'm assuming they're going to try to expand it, you know, against all the devices out there.
But they're basically trying to make laws pass now to prevent people from pirating their games.
That's funny.
Yeah.
That's hilarious.
Don't you think that'll just make it worse, or what?
Well, yes.
I actually, because of the news, I went ahead and bought another one.
Just...
Just in case.
No, just, you know, because my wife wanted one for, you know, she plays puzzle games and I don't see, you know,
Well, let me read this real fast before we talk a little more about this because this is right in the same line with us talking about how you guys are running off and buying one and all this.
Actually, the word is that the R4 pricing and the sales of them are increasing a lot after this whole lawsuit happened.
Apparently, in two days' time, the price of an R4 at some stores in Japan went from just under 3,000 yen to just under 5,000 yen.
We're talking from $28 to $55 literally overnight.
The question is, is maybe that what Nintendo was trying to go for?
Driving the price of these up due to the fear?
I don't know.
That seems a little counterproductive to me because it makes the demand of them go up in a way.
I don't think that's really going to affect anything because people are just buying them really fast now.
They're just figuring, hey, we can cash in on it now.
But when the demand goes back down, they're just going to clear out their inventory somewhere and they'll still be sold somewhere.
I don't know.
Hey, I mean, at least they're taking notice of this, I guess.
In a way, though, devil's advocate, Loki, these devices can promote piracy.
So why should they be allowed on the market?
Well, because guns can kill people, so, you know...
It's not the gun killing the people, it's the people killing the people with the guns.
It's just like, these devices, sure, they can allow you to pirate games, but it's the people pirating the games that are actually pirating the games.
Chat room, I'm very, very curious to hear what you guys have to say in our chat room.
Chat.OrangeLauncher.com I want to read some of your comments.
Is...
What do you think of this?
Are these devices okay?
Or are you against these devices?
I remember we had a listener a while ago that was very, very anti-piracy that would usually chime in on these issues.
He hasn't been around in a while.
But maybe you pissed him off finally, Loki.
I don't know.
I'm curious.
There's got to be folks on both ends of the spectrum.
What do you guys in chat think about this whole deal?
DarkSakura, you say you're interested in buying one.
I'm going to ask the same question to you.
Devil's Advocate, these devices, you could say they do promote piracy.
They do allow you to play copied games on your system.
Why should they be allowed?
Well, I mean, honestly, I don't think that they necessarily should be allowed.
I mean...
www.DarkSakura.com
Well, this is what my thought would be, is that Nintendo talk to the developers and make multi-packs of old games so that...
X number of games on a cartridge for $30.
They could market something like that.
Or even have their own download service for old games like that.
Like Virtual Console?
I'm talking about for the DS.
Perhaps they're looking at the Virtual Console and perhaps expanding it to the DS and going to put out a device similar to that to do such a thing anyways.
And they're worried people are going to pirate the Virtual Console games which are $5-$10 a pop.
Thanks for watching!
or the fact that they're worried that sales are going to dip a lot like the PSP because they blame piracy on that.
I blame bad games, but you know.
But piracy kind of being able to play old Nintendo games on the PSP kind of drove sales in the beginning.
Jamie, I want to let you finish your thought before I go to chat comments.
Yes, thank you.
You're welcome.
My whole point is that I honestly do think that Nintendo might be looking to market something like that.
And it doesn't really matter because piracy is illegal.
That's the end of the story.
If you use something that is non-proprietary that is not sponsored by Nintendo to play copies of their games, it is technically theft.
so I don't think they're ever going to be okay but I think Nintendo might be looking for a way to sort of market the idea for their own benefit so I can see why they would want to push it although honestly Nintendo has had the easiest way to pirate or play imports or anything on their systems because in the past it was just a physical lockout you adjust a tab and boom you can play your imports on your Super Nintendo you know
There were absolutely no lockouts on the old Game Boys.
You can still play imports on the DS and you can buy those multi-game cartridges for dirt cheap.
So really, the whole problem I think is that Nintendo needs to look at how they're actually allowing it, is how I see it.
They've had to have built in so much because they have not been the best at preventing the piracy from going on.
Let's look at some comments from chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because it's your show too here at Orange Lounge Radio.
We'd like to hear what you guys have to say.
Blake says, it's the law of software.
Stopping piracy is impossible no matter how hard you try.
Actdeft says, disclaimer, use it for homebrew only as in programs and stuff.
Don't pirate, please.
To which I think this is kind of a good follow-up comment.
Joshi16 says, it would be like banning smoking pipes because you can put illegal drugs in it, but you can also put tobacco in them.
So it's kind of like how you choose to use it.
Interesting.
DarkTetsuya says, I agree with Loki though.
I probably wouldn't risk my DS by using one of those.
If it breaks, I'm screwed.
MissingNo says, I heart the R4.
But that's the thing though, is it won't hurt your DS at all because it's a device that runs on a cart.
You're not flashing your DS.
You're not doing anything to your DS.
Alpha Cananogram says, this is bullshit, but if they do take down these devices, they need to leave the homebrew-only flash carts alone.
TigerClaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a homebrew up to listen to internet radio on your DS.
GameGuru says, well, if Nintendo makes their own R4, that would be cool.
And I love this name, too.
The original snake, Lieutenant Plissken, says, absolutely okay.
Sure, it makes it possible, but there are lots of homebrew and other features.
People will always find a way to pirate.
I thought this comment was interesting though.
Hitstun says, I guess I still don't understand how piracy is theft.
I'm not sure if you're being facetious, but do keep in mind, you know, people get paid to make games just like people get paid to make movies and paid to write music and what have you.
And when you take it without paying for it, that's less money.
Now, granted, you get into this whole...
Thank you for watching!
PS3 films on BitTorrent while you're waiting for the European PSN network.
So, yeah, he's actually saying that we, and this is a quote, we are a PAL market and we are going to do it in PAL and we are going to do it properly.
So he said that if you want the good quality, then you can, you know, I guess just wait for it or download it like everyone else does.
Uh-huh.
It's not often you hear people acknowledging.
He's an idiot.
I have something I want to say about Sony, which is completely off-base, so before I go on tangent, does anyone want to comment on the actual story?
Okay.
I saw Casino Royale for the first time last night, which, by the way, I forgot how sexy Bond movies are.
Isn't James Bond just a sexy fucking franchise of movies?
I don't know if I watched the last movie.
But just in general, all the way back to the Sean Connery days.
DarkSakura?
If you say so.
Really?
I think they're hot.
I like certain movies.
I'll put it that way.
This is how it's relevant.
They whored Sony in that movie.
James Bond uses a VAIO.
The cell phones were from Sony.
The movie studio to put that out, I'm sure, was Sony Pictures.
I just lulled at the fact how much Sony was whored in that movie.
It was just kind of fun.
I noticed.
Usually, I don't notice those things.
And if we made a movie, we would be putting orange on stuff all over it?
Well, that's different.
We're trying to buy dinner.
These people have a lot of money.
Well, they're trying to buy a lot of dinner at the same time.
Alright, forget it.
Move on.
So, in case you had some hope out there that Final Fantasy XIII Versus was possibly coming to the Xbox 360, Square says no, it's not.
In fact, according to their video that they played during their latest fan event, I don't even know how you would pronounce this...
DKS3713 party.
Anyways, they had the video for Final Fantasy Versus which said PlayStation 3 only worldwide.
And in small print, fuck you Xbox 360 fanboys.
No, just kidding.
It was not coming out on the 360.
Although, I'd be interested to see if that's actually going to be the case when the 360 version of Final Fantasy 13 comes out and kicks ass sales-wise.
But...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4 different Final Fantasy 13 games at the same time.
No, because they've released 7 different Final Fantasy 7 games.
Yeah, over the course of 5 years or something.
But now it's just like, hey, those all sold really well.
Let's make a lot of games all portioned apart.
And you won't be buying them?
I won't be buying every single... No, 2 of the 3.
One of which happens to be on... Well, one of them...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Only the PlayStation 3 version and only in Japan because they're not going cross-platform over in Japan.
However, it will be out in 2009 and then they're going to start the localization and the port for the Xbox 360, which probably means we'll see it in 2010 because when they say they're going to get it in 2009, that probably means Christmas of 2009.
But we'll see.
It could be pleasantly surprised.
Who knows?
All I know, I can't wait to see what the game actually looks like.
Pingu Waku Waku Carnival
I don't really know much about these games except one of them is Snoopy and the other one has a funny name.
But there's no release date for them in anywhere but Japan and it just says Autumn.
Really, it should be called Fozzy Waka Waka Carnival.
That's Waku.
I know.
Okay.
He was making a bad joke.
That was a really bad joke.
I'm going to throw a tomato at Loki.
At least it's a lot better than, I don't know, a Snoopy game.
Peanuts are still very popular overseas.
Peanuts are still very popular in my house.
I love peanuts.
You know what will never stop being awesome?
Ever?
Snoopy snow cone machines.
Those are the greatest thing ever.
See?
I rest my case.
Loki, remember when we lived together and I bought one?
and DarkSakura.com.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkTetsuya says, good grief, Rob.
Well, something that's not Snoopy related, but a lot cooler.
Japanese Advent Children fans are going to be happy that
A brand new Director's Cut will be coming to Blu-ray soon, and with it will be coming the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
And with that, will also be coming a new PS3 bundle.
All this is supposed to happen March 2009, and I don't know, I'm excited.
May have to import it.
So is it just me or is it one of those things where I should have known the whole time this is why Final Fantasy VII Advent Children was kind of short.
This was just coming the whole time.
Bonus, 20 minutes deleted footage or whatever.
Sucker.
I should just tattoo it on my forehead.
I should everyone else who bought it.
I would also like to remind listeners of this show not to text me while I'm doing the show.
Thank you.
I get that too.
I don't get that because I turn my phone off.
Well, good for you.
Alright, the PSP game which Loki earlier referred to is that kind of missing Final Fantasy XIII game.
You've heard a lot about Final Fantasy XIII and Versus XIII.
Well, there's also Gaito XIII is coming out as well.
Agito.
Agito
More multi-platformism in the Square Enix world and this game soon to be on the PSP.
Well, not soon, but eventually, one day, far in the future, to be on the PSP.
Well, speaking of which, I don't know if anyone remembers that the latest Parasite Eve game was supposed to be exclusive on mobile phones.
Well, Squeenix actually said that it will be out on PSP.
And it doesn't say anything about there being a mobile phone version in development, but it's called The Third Birthday.
And they had some sort of trailer of it up that has the main character, Aya, in a wedding dress.
So...
I don't know.
Oh, with a gun.
Because you have to have a gun.
You have to have a gun.
This is a franchise people have been waiting for for a long, long time.
I think it's been eight years since the last one.
It's been a long time.
Will she be in her birthday suit?
I wish they'd translate the novel.
Yeah, that's right.
There was like a novel.
Wasn't there something else that was like a cell phone game or something?
There was also a live action movie.
There was a movie.
I've got the movie somewhere, but I haven't watched it yet.
But my friends read the novel a couple of times and says it's pretty good.
I saw the movie.
It was pretty cool.
I don't remember much of it, though.
I remember your mitochondria are full of evil.
Son of Dad in chat says Parasite Eve 2 is kind of a letdown.
Well, I didn't play it.
Let's move on.
All right.
Well, we're still waiting for Home.
Still.
Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Xevious
and there'll be three secret titles that are still on the way.
Mappy for the win.
You know what?
One good thing about this, though, and I assume you don't have to pay to play these games, is that you don't have to pay to play these games.
That's a hell of an assumption, by the way.
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be interesting if you... Because a lot of people thought this should be Xbox Live's price model.
Wouldn't it be interesting if you have to insert a quarter, quote-unquote, to play the games?
I will not be playing those games.
That's the case.
Because...
I have them on 360 DarkSakura, I'm kind of curious what you think about the Namco games being at home because I know you're an avid collector of the museum games so it kind of feels like we've had to buy them before and now they're going to be free maybe?
If they're free I'll get them, if not I don't care
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Actdeft says free is good except for Yaris.
I want to say those primetime games are probably going to be free and they're going to probably finance them with advertisements.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI
I didn't find it to be that hard either.
Do you remember, Loki?
It was fucking easy.
It was just like stupid easy.
Well, here's the thing.
Apparently, someone does not agree, and the name is Alex Edwards, and he is actually kind of... It's not so much a lawsuit, but what has happened is one thing has led to another.
There is now a new Illinois law that mandates that MMO providers have to make an online cancellation option available, that you have to be able to do it online.
It is online!
That's what I was thinking, but here's the deal, here's how the story goes.
This guy was playing Final Fantasy XI, he grew tired of the game, his parents were paying $13 a month, and they tried to cancel the account online.
But the claim is that Final Fantasy didn't offer them a way to do it online, didn't offer a contact phone number, so finally they went to the credit card statement to get the phone number, spent an hour and 45 minutes on hold, finally someone answered the phone, and they got it cancelled.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and then was like you know how awful play online is to uninstall and then it was like oh crap I can't delete it from the website I was supposed to do that on play online well duh that's what the instructions say and you have a manual hi well maybe in that regard does it have some merit then that you actually have to still have the game installed to be able to cancel it I mean to be honest you don't for Warcraft you can do that all on the website it's super easy I mean if you can't figure out how to cancel wow you're dumb I mean it's really really easy to cancel wow
He just pissed off that there's no big, giant button that encompasses the entire screen that says, TO CANCEL, CLICK HERE!
I mean, seriously, it was not that hard to figure out how to cancel.
It wasn't hidden in menus, it was so easy.
It was right on the Play Online screen, if you wanted to cancel it.
And obviously they had to have signed up for an account, and it's done the exact same way as you cancel it, so...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Just because I wanted to read the summary of the actual law.
An internet gaming service provider that provides service to a consumer for a stated term that is automatically renewed for another term unless a consumer cancels the service must give a consumer who is an Illinois resident a secure method at the internet gaming service provider's website that the consumer may use to cancel the service, which method shall not require the consumer to make a telephone call or send U.S.
Postal Service mail to effectuate the cancellation, and to...
instructions that the consumer may follow to cancel the service at the internet gaming service provider's website makes it an unlawful business practice for an internet gaming service provider to violate the new provisions now is it just me though or was it a heck of a lot easier to cancel Final Fantasy XI than it was to cancel America Online maybe I'm crazy but at least they weren't begging me to stay actually if you call them and do it they try to get you to stay by giving you free months
On Final Fantasy XI even?
No.
Oh, yeah.
America Online tries to pull it all out.
I was like, my account was already free.
Retention.
Anyhow, so there you have it.
New laws.
Ridiculous.
Oh, my God.
It's so stupid.
But anyway, how about some release dates?
Like three items coming out on the 8th in Europe?
Beijing 2008, The Official Video Game of the Olympic Games, Race Driver Grid, and The Mummy Tomb of the Emperor on PlayStation 2.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
B-Boy PS2, PSP
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I believe that is the one that comes with the Xbox 360, if I'm not mistaken.
I think there was a bundle pack coming out in Japan.
Don't quote me on that.
Also, a PlayStation 3 version of NBA 2K8 is being released this week.
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii.
Survival Kids Wii.
I wonder if that's Lost in Blue.
It is Lost in Blue.
Yeah, I think it is.
Survival Kids.
Yes, it's Lost in Blue on the Wii.
So that's coming out.
and Imabikiyosu Kamihen comes out as well on the Wii this week from Sega.
And this game looks to be... What the heck?
It looks like it might be a...
DarkSakura.com
I think the brains at the OL Army headquarters need to get to work on a horror dating sim.
Not a whore, but a horror.
On the PlayStation 2, God of War 2 gets a price reduction this week in Japan, moving into the Best Price series.
Also, Grim Grimoire and Sengoku Barasa 2 Heroes also move into that same series.
Some new games coming out this week.
True Tears is coming out, as well as Aoi Koro no Kusabi Hiro no Kakera 3 comes out in Japan this week, which is looks like some type of role-playing-ish game.
You play a dude...
I don't know, it kind of looks like a dating sim.
Why would he have a sword if it's a dating sim?
Because all cool kids have swords who date.
Because if it goes bad, you know, they can commit suicide.
Just stop.
Just stop.
Hey, I just wanted to mention real quick that in a couple weeks, actually, we're going to be getting Line Rider 2, which is exciting for the DS and the Wii.
on the Nintendo DS.
Monster Farm 2 DS in Japan this week, as well as Fire Emblem.
Shin Ankoku Ryoutu Nihikari no Ken comes out this week, as well as Chou Shoutou Kadoukis 2, which is a game from Atlus, comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.
Oh, it's Trauma Center 2.
Nice.
You finally get that in Japan this week.
Coming out on the Sony PSP, just some price reductions on Quiz Mobile Suit Gundam Tonsenshi, as well as Dai Senryaku Portable 2 and Doku Makimuri Kai.
They all get price reductions this week.
But as far as new games go, Crazy Taxi Double Punch comes out on the PSP this week in Japan.
That's happy.
Get ready to make some crazy money.
That's it for your Japanese release dates.
Back to some gaming news.
Well, in other gaming news, and this actually isn't necessarily just Just Just Game, but this is for our cosplay people as well.
Gamefly is having an open casting for the next commercial, so they actually want cosplayers to send them videos saying why they love Gamefly and why the character that they're dressed up at is their favorite.
Um...
But, you know, I think it's going to be kind of iffy, but here's the details if anyone wants it.
There are live casting calls that are going to be in LA, New York, and Chicago.
That's in September, and you actually send a 45 second entry after August 26th.
As far as more information on this, the live casting calls are September 9th, Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Highland Center.
And that's 12 to 6 p.m.
PST.
September 16th in Chicago, ESPN Zone on East Ohio Street from 12 to 6 Central Time.
And September 23rd, New York at Hawaiian Tropic Zone on 7th Avenue and 49th Street at 12 to 6 p.m.
EST.
All those cosplayers are going to fit right in at Hollywood and Highland.
I actually told Ranma, the minute I read about this, I went to Twitter and I posted, Ranma!
Black Luigi needs to be in this commercial.
Make it happen.
So he said he's going to go.
So I hope if he... Cover it for us.
Yeah, cover it for us.
I want to know if it is any good or if it seems like a scam or whatever.
But I think it'll be good.
I want lots of photos from this event.
You know people are going to go just for the photo ops because that's like half the big thing about cosplay is your photo ops too.
Any excuse to be on TV, people are going to go nuts.
But you know people are going to see these commercials too and go, what?
Yeah, I know.
But there'll be other people that gets it.
Hey, cosplay opportunity, go for it.
Exactly.
Hey, cosplayers can get like actual real recognition in the real world.
I think it's a good thing.
So there you go.
Loki is going to be giving us a massive homebrew update tonight.
What is this?
There's like massive amounts of news in the homebrew world.
It's just a bunch of little small things.
So I just thought I'd mention it.
WeBrew.com
and what it does is it allows you to kind of toggle different things you want to be installed in one giant zip file and you download it and you drag and drop it to your SD memory card and if you have Twilight Princess you can use the Twilight hack to install the homebrew channel and a bunch of different homebrew programs on there and they've got a huge list of stuff and they keep adding more to it so definitely the way to go if you haven't
Don Homebrew Stuff Yet, or if you just want to make it easy to find all your programs in one spot.
Rob, I think we'll get some use out of this, but they have the Any Title Deleter.
It's a space-freeing program for the Wii.
It allows you to remove previously unremovable tiles, including the weather and news channel.
Unfortunately, though, if you have any games that have updates, they will reinstall them for you, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and of course everything will be in Japanese there is some risk involved with it though you have to read the instructions very carefully because you can actually brick your console with this if it's not done right so don't do it
Just don't.
Just don't.
and you can import custom songs and all sorts of things well the new version 2.9 has come out it's still in beta but it now has online support and so they have instructions on how you can set up your PC or router I guess to be able to play online with other people so that's kind of neat though you can do online in it I don't know if you can actually do online on the Wii with Guitar Hero 3 I think you might be able to but either way it's still cool um
Thanks for watching!
and that's it
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Like a 3D space shooter, it's actually now becoming a full game on the PlayStation Network That's going to be downloadable via them, you actually have to pay for it now But you'll be able to download it to your PSP and play it But it's the first time that a homebrew game like this has become downloadable on the PlayStation platform So that's kind of neat
And hopefully they'll be coming soon.
Okay.
Well, I wanted to read this comment from chat.
Going back to the cosplay Gamefly commercial thing.
SSJ100Matt, I believe, was the one that said this.
Manfei.
Could Manfei make an appearance?
Manfei would either be scary or fantastic.
That's kind of both extremes, don't you think?
I want the male Utena cosplayer to show up who looked perfectly female.
I wish I lived in New York with Ranma because I'd go and dress as Black Mage.
So maybe we could both be in it.
I'm not sure what...
Black Mage has in common with Luigi, but you never know.
I am very excited about this upcoming game, and DarkSakura, I don't know about you, but maybe you'll play this with me.
SingStar Musicals is a new rumored game to be coming out.
Supposedly, it's going to be coming out in 2009, and some songs that are rumored to be in it, Bad Guys from Bugsy Malone, Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King,
If I Were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof and Over the Rainbow from Wizard of Oz.
However, I need this song to be in it.
If at all possible.
Oh, not Springtime for Hitler?
No, you should find the one from the movie.
Okay.
Is that one from the movie?
No.
It's from... Well, no, it's just because John Barrowman sang the one in the movie.
I don't think they have the one from the movie on iTunes.
The recent movie, because... Well, I think he's wonderful.
So yeah, this is a rumored game that's going to be coming out.
That being said, I actually think this rumor is bull.
I think this rumor is a load of crap.
I don't believe that it's true.
One of the big reasons I don't think it's true is that this rumored song list has Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King.
Disney owns that, and if Disney was going to put that in a game, Disney would be making a Disney game.
Disney, I don't think, would be likely to loan this out.
One of their biggest songs, I mean, granted, I don't know, I guess Elton John wrote it, so maybe there's a way around it.
Not really a musical either.
Actually, yes, they did a Lion King musical.
I know they did, but it's Disney's musical.
It's not Sony's.
You know what I mean?
And I don't think Sony would be able to license that from Disney.
Does that make sense?
I don't know if it's necessarily Disney that owns Soul Rites.
Plus, I mean, would there really be that many people that are going to buy this?
I would.
I would too, but we're kind of weird.
So?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I still want to import it.
This will be fun.
There's also been a big surge in West End Theater now, especially with those shows that they're doing now.
Sort of like a pop idol for musicals.
How do you solve a problem like Maria?
Hey, that was a John Barrowman show.
Yes, it was.
I'm thinking you're a fangirl.
You are ruining my song!
Oh, me sorry, me no mean to!
Well, if you wouldn't mind, please, being quiet for a minute so I can finish?
I'm glad we have this new technology.
Poor porn.
Which gives us untold opportunities.
Poor porn.
Oh, sorry.
God, it'll never get old.
Avenue Q is playing in town, Rob.
We have to go see it.
We need to go.
Seriously.
I know.
Poor porn.
We've said that as the previous cage match winner, if I do recall correctly.
I think it was a cage match winner at one point.
Love it!
And a very good question from chat.
Very, very good informed question.
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what about SingStar Rocky Horror Edition?
Yes, please.
That would be hot.
How do you do I?
See you've met my faithful handyman.
An audience participation sub-track.
Do you know how much money I would pay for Loki to sing Sweet Transvestite live on air?
DarkSakura will dig through the archive and tell you kids what you should be playing
What should the children be paying a little respect to this week?
The game of the week is Jumping Flash.
Nice.
I love Jumping Flash.
But I've mentioned this show on air many, many, many times.
When I first moved into my college dorm room, I was put in charge of my friend's boyfriend's PlayStation.
Jumping Flash, Barren Aloha, Robot,
has to use these jetpods to, you know, I guess break these jetpods and get the little islands back to Earth.
What?
Can I just say to Son of Dad in chat, this is not Jumpin' Jack Flash with Whoopi Goldberg.
No!
Stop it!
Anyway, the way that the game plays is it is very first person, and I will tell you that this totally, totally made me motion sick as hell, but it's great.
And actually, the article makes a note that it's actually just like a game called Geograph Seal, which is for the Sharp X68000, so I'll have to look for that later on.
But anyway, you play as Robert looking through Robert's eyes and you've got a screen showing you how much time you have remaining in your score and the sidekick called Kumagoro, which gives you hints and warnings and helps you out.
You've also got fireworks items as your firing mechanism, power-ups, jetpods, all this other neat stuff that goes with it.
So the big thing about those, you have to jump.
And you can make him jump three times.
You can jump off the ground twice in mid-air.
And you can get really high over the ground.
and instead of being faced horizontally, when you jump, the camera tilts down towards the ground.
So, you see why I'm talking about getting motion sick there too?
But you can also use your enemies to bounce off of in some cases.
But you get different fireworks for attacks, like cherry bombs, rockets, roman candles, and twisters.
You can get time extensions.
You can get different jetpods that are EXIT.
And so when you get them, you go to the exit pad and you can leave the level.
You also have hidden levels.
The rollercoaster level was fun, I have to say.
and you have a time attack mode so you can try to get out of the levels in a certain amount of time.
There also was a sequel that was called Jumping Flash 2 that did not do as well.
But it was still a fun game.
And apparently there were pseudo-sequels that were only released in Japan.
There was Robert Mundu on PlayStation and Pocket Mumu that was on Pocket Station.
Awesome.
What?
PocketMuMu PocketMuMu
But, um, it's actually, you can, you can get Jumping Flash at the PlayStation Store.
And, uh, coming soon, uh, the next sequel, Captain Uma Uma Nuka Nuka Apawaha.
Never mind.
Bad joke.
Oh, come on, Ferret.
I never actually played, uh, Jumping Flash.
You didn't!
No, I never did.
I have Jumping Flash in the massive old PlayStation cases.
I was in college.
Puzzle Fighter came out years after.
At any rate, if you want to play this game, then I will see about locating my copy of it and bringing it over or something.
Awesome.
It's cheeseball and it's early PlayStation, but it's a fun little game.
Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
With that, Jump and Flash, your classic game of the week.
We're going to take a quick break, but we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after some music for the live listeners.
And actually, if things get sent to me in time here, we'll do some music.
Oh yes, we're going to have some music on the podcast as well tonight.
I'll tell you a little bit more about that in just a minute.
But we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey all our listeners, this is GS68 with a public service announcement.
When playing Super Smash Brothers, do not have fun.
Do not play with items on.
Items ruin the balance of the game and add randomness.
Do not pick low-tier characters.
You'll not win with them, no matter what.
The best Bowser player will always lose to the worst Fox player.
The only stage allowed is Final Destination.
If a stage has more than a flat plane on it, it's bad.
It ruins the balance of the game by giving characters advantages.
Take your F-Zero gimmicks and shove it.
Huge stages like Howard Castle are for camping morons.
Even Smashville is barely acceptable because there's a freaking moving platform on top of the main platform.
And finally, remember,
I don't care if you're at a party and just want to have fun with your friends.
Video games are not about fun.
They're about winning.
So shut the fuck up and stop having fun because video games are serious business.
Thank you and good night.
This PSA was brought to you by Mushroomy Kingdom, of the never-ending scrolling bullshit.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
Be sure to navigate through the forums and find the OL Archive, where you can find such clips as this.
I fucking hate this game!
Goddamn you, Konami!
Goddamn you!
Ah yes, the good old days of Orange Lounge Radio.
That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter closet, wasn't it?
I think so.
I think it was one of those weekends.
Back when Karaoke Revolution was funny.
Anyhow, thanks to our listeners who provided the bumpers that break.
GS68 was the first one and PKJR92.
Did the second one, so thank you guys so much for those bumpers.
If you have a bumper you want to send, go look at the forums.
There's a whole post about us accepting things for our free break, and that would be fake PSAs, promos for non-profit shows and things like that, and so on.
So hope to get some stuff from you.
Meanwhile, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 3rd of 2008.
For more Orange Lounge Radio gaming news, gaming chat, gaming bitching, and whatever we can come up with.
Loki, how about some Xbox news?
Yeah, so there's another rumor coming out.
Yeah, another one.
I know.
This one actually has come from Ars Technica, and apparently they have their Microsoft insider who lets them know all the wonderful rumors and information and stuff like that.
They were once...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I guess by that time they'll be all gone.
What's going to happen is the Elite's going to drop down to $399 from $449, so that's a pretty nice drop there, another $50.
The 68 system will drop down to what the Pro system is now for $299, and the Arcade system will drop from $279 to $199.
So that's pretty cool.
And apparently around that time also the hard drive is supposed to... The 120 hard drive is supposed to drop in price.
And I think probably the 60 as well.
So we'll be coming out at some point.
And the other interesting thing about that that kind of coincides with all that is there was some screenshots on VGCharts apparently from the inside of their...
Some system, I don't know what store this is from, but it's saying that the price drop is going to happen, confirmed on the arcade system on September 7th, 2008.
So that seems to give this a little more legitimacy than when this rumor usually flies around, because I was just about to ask, what makes this any different from any other price cut rumor?
XBOX 360 XBOX 360
Infinite Undiscovery, and Rock Band 2.
Well, a time exclusive for Rock Band 2.
But I say it's because the PlayStation 3 exclusives are going to be coming out around that time too.
Actually, they're going to start coming out with a lot of their big PlayStation exclusives around October.
And if they kind of get a jump on everything, especially now that they're talking about putting out a core...
and DarkSakura.com
Is Wii $1.99 or is Wii $2.50?
Oh, see, they're going to be cheaper than the Wii at this point.
That's huge.
That's really huge, I think.
Do you think Nintendo's going to have to follow suit?
No.
I guess not, Wii's are still in demand.
XBOX ZOMBIES
I love zombies.
XBOX LIVE Arcade Game
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But don't you think it would be cool?
And the answer is, yes.
Zombies are always cool.
Zombies are fantastic.
So they have a chat room.
What do you think?
Yes or no to zombies on Xbox Live?
I'm all for more of the board game type fare on Xbox Live Arcade, too.
I think those games are fun.
Well, and other fun.
And this makes me particularly happy because you know I love Valve.
Right?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you know that there's going to be a Portal Still Alive coming out on Xbox Live, but it looks like Valve is really considering bringing other titles from their services.
So I think that's pretty cool.
And that they actually don't yet have any immediate plans to try the Wii or PS3.
So, hey, they love you, Microsoft Xbox owners.
You have the love of Valve.
indeed very much but you do not have GLaDOS in this one and that is not as great
So do you think it's kind of a money milking thing?
Kind of a cheap... All business is money milking when you think about it.
Yes, it's true.
Only if you're a non-profit organization do you not look to make a profit, right?
True.
Commenting to a question Lieutenant Plissken asked in chat, says, can you put a hard drive in the no hard drive model of the 360?
Let's say you want to download Portal Still Alive and these other possible future Valve releases.
Yes, you can.
You can put a hard drive in the core model.
It's very easy.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Good times, because I came on here and I bitched, whined, and moaned on the show so bad.
I was so pissed.
But all's better now in Rob's world.
Especially after the yumminess of Soul Calibur 4 and Geometry Wars 2 this week.
You know, I'm going to have to get that Geometry Wars, I think.
At least get the demo.
The demo, from what I hear, is almost the full deadline mode, which is get as many points as you can in three minutes.
And it's a really good way to test if you're going to like the game or not.
So, at least get the demo.
So, let's move on.
Okay, shit.
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you over there.
Well, you guys were still talking about freaking Geometry Wars.
I was waiting.
Anyways, so...
You may remember that the Bourne Supremacy just came out beginning of June and that was part of the whole Vividi license and stuff, actually Sierra Entertainment.
Well now that they've been purchased by Activision and Blizzard have merged together, they're starting to, or Activision and Vividi and Blizzard and all those companies have merged together, they're starting to kind of go through what franchises they own and kind of slim it down a bit.
and one of those franchises, of course, is The Bourne Supremacy.
or Born Conspiracy, I'm sorry.
And actually the whole Born lineup.
In fact, there's some other stuff about that as well.
But they're actually giving back the Born Conspiracy to Lundrum Entertainment because Robert Lundrum, of course, was the guy that wrote the Born books.
So it's kind of going back to them.
And I guess, I don't know if they want to put any other games out.
They have to find a new publisher, I guess.
Interesting.
Well, you know, it didn't just stop there with the Bourne series.
Activision, Blizzard, they're kind of looking at some of the other franchises as well.
And some of the franchises that were rumored this week, Brutal Legend, Ghostbusters, the video game, were supposed to be lost.
It actually came out a little later in the week.
That is not true.
Ghostbusters, absolutely not canceled, according to Vivendi Sierra.
Not canceled.
That is still happening.
The spokesperson for Sierra had actually said, quote, First and foremost, the game is not canceled.
However, the game may not have a publisher right now.
That was a little more in the blue there.
Also, Brutal Legend is fine.
So that series is still supposed to be on the way.
Well, it's really weird, though, that they would keep Spyro, Crash, and all that stuff and get rid of, I don't know, the good games.
Spyro's kind of a money machine.
Yeah, and they kept 50 Cent.
Blood in the Sand, or whatever that thing is.
That game sounds very interesting.
Chronicles of Riddick, apparently, was booted to the curb, too.
Yeah, but that, I think, was a long ways away anyway.
Well, I just hope they didn't get rid of the Island of Dr. Brain.
Am I right?
What?
Because the Island of Dr. Brain was an awesome Sierra game.
If you say so.
I wonder, you remember, it was probably like a year ago, we had those kids that were making The Silver Lining, remember that?
The unofficial King's Quest sequel The Silver Lining, and then they went through that whole song and dance where they had to lose the King's Quest ties, and now the game is just being released as The Silver Lining I wonder if all this recent, you know, mergey merge news means maybe they can get away with doing it as a King's Quest game again I doubt it, but it's still nice to imagine I suppose, if you want to keep dreaming Yeah, I know
The Hay.
If we didn't have Dreamers, we also wouldn't have Bums.
So, kidding.
Lieutenant Plissken makes a very excellent point in chat.
Chat.orange.com.
50 cent greater than Chronicles of Riddick?
Question mark, exclamation point.
Both great.
Question mark, question mark.
You know what we need?
Speaking of movie franchises from 10 years ago, when I went to see The Dark Knight the other day, they were showing on the screen a preview for Starship Troopers 3.
Why did we never get a video game for that?
well you know I'm not sure if everyone's familiar but there were screen captures and video out for Soul Calibur 4 that was showing Darth Vader and Yoda in the same game which as we knew Yoda was in the Xbox 360 edition and Darth Vader was in the PS3 one and the director of the game Katsuto Shisasaki said that they don't have any plans for making either one downloadable content for either console
um but then again apparently those screen captures and uh and the video that was out are supposed to be legitimate you know actual same versions of the game so
Maybe, I mean, maybe that was just like a... I would assume that in programming both characters would have been included, right?
So it might just be from the developer's kit or something.
You know, it could be either from the developer's kit or there's a rumor floating around and you really would have to read in between the lines.
This guy's saying it's not going to be download content, right?
Some of the rumors that are going around say that if you buy The Force Unleashed, the game that The Apprentice or Starkiller is actually starring in, it unlocks the other Star Wars character on your respective system.
That's smart.
It's an interesting way of doing it.
It's a way of saying, hey, buy this game and please don't think that it sucks.
No, it's not download content.
It's the biggest version of Pay to Unlock ever.
Well, the question is then, if that's the case, then I wonder if it's a save file or something like that.
Who knows?
But the other thing to consider, there's a trailer for the Force Unleashed in the game.
And I'm sure that's part of how they were able to negotiate Starkiller and Yoda being in the game.
But just very interesting.
It kind of makes you think, ah, maybe this is it.
I see what you did there.
I would bet 10 to 1 that's going to be the way you unlock it, is that you have to get Force Unleashed.
Which means they'll be impossible to find on Gamefly.
And I wonder if having the fact that you have Soul Calibur IV, if that unlocks something for you on the Force Unleashed.
Perhaps.
Maybe an alternate costume for Starkiller, since he does have two in Soul Calibur.
Who knows?
It might be a little silly, but you never know.
The unlocks aren't always that great.
They should just chain them.
They'll have something else and then you'll unlock... Just time release Vader.
You know, like three months from now, just time release him.
Do a patch that unlocks him.
It's obvious something's going to go there.
There's one square in the game that is not filled in.
And if you look on the PlayStation... That goes for nobody.
It's very obvious.
That's like, you know...
One for me and one for my homies.
They looped like six characters in one screen, the star screen, not to be confused with Starkiller.
They had famous anime creators make Soul Calibur characters, but they're just all filed under the star icon in the select menu.
And some of them are pretty cool, actually.
But anyhow, sorry, getting off topic.
Yeah.
That's interesting, though.
Good theory.
Star Wars, The Shit Game
Really strange stuff in there, from a level with crashing planes to a giant foot like Monty Python, floating eyeballs, fire, all sorts of crazy stuff.
Basically, the game is very short, but it challenges you to try to beat it, losing the least amount of lives and getting through it quickly.
There are a lot of quick ways you can glitch through the game.
Monty Python's Flying Circus I knew this was coming
Oh, and the best part about the game, I forgot to mention, is that all the music in it is MIDI.
And it's all like, you know, like pop music MIDI.
Like they have Spice Girls in there, and it's all randomly selected to, like Lanny Kravitz and Spice Girls and stuff.
I think that from here on out, all the rest of Loki's story should be done to Monty Python's Flying Circus opening.
Okay, we can arrange that.
Okay.
Okay.
We'll see how that works.
We'll try.
Now, here's the thing, though.
Wouldn't this be Shit Game 2?
Because I've played Ping Pals.
Well, it's Shit Game 3, because I've also played Yaris.
Oh, I see.
But see, that's the thing, is this game's actually better.
But seriously, though, the character looks like he's made from MS Paint, and I think he was.
He looked... Oh, it was hilarious.
I watched the video of it.
I did download the game before the show.
Haven't played it yet, but I'm gonna give it a try.
The FUs of the Week
My FU of the week, um, it first of all goes towards my cat and her passengers.
I have had to bathe the cat today.
She has bad fleas, and they did not all wash off.
So I have to get a hold of Heather, you know, I have to get a hold of Heather and get some front lines for my kitty cat.
Well, I know Heather, but the listeners don't know Heather.
Heather is awesome!
Okay, that's all you need to know.
That's all you need to know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Loki, your FU's of the week
with their cell phones and just driving fucking slow and just really annoying in fact this woman actually she drove through the parking lot really slow
Oh, my other favorite thing is when there's a slight dip in the road or something like that and people slow the fuck down.
When they're in an SUV, an off-roading vehicle, and they slow the fuck down because it's a little dip in the road.
Oh my god, that's also annoying.
Just a point though, somebody talking on the cell phone in their parking lot wouldn't technically be illegal.
They're still driving.
I know, but technically they can't pull you over in the parking lot.
Well, she's still driving around, so that still counts.
Just a technicality.
I'm just saying.
And I followed her there, so.
But she's a dumb bitch, and I actually thought about knocking on her window and going, get off the fucking phone, ass.
But no, I had better things to do.
FU to Clothes Shopping
but I went to Mervin's this week because I heard they were filing chapter 11 bankruptcy and I want to make sure I get all the good sales before the chain goes under and also thanks to me being sick earlier this year and the diet that has resulted I've lost another waist size so I had to buy all new jeans and that's expensive clothes are expensive so F you to expensive clothes
But a non-FU to Mervin's and a non-FU to Mervin's sales.
Because those are both awesome.
Still need to go to the outlets though this week.
Because the outlets are the best thing ever.
All right, let's get back into some gaming news.
So if you think about it, you could go all the way back to the Wii NES Retro port.
This is a device that was released that allows you to, yes, plug in your old school NES controller and play Mega Man 9 the way it might have been meant to be played with the old school NES controller.
What do you guys think?
Is this worth going through the hassle just to play with the old school NES controller?
Maybe.
Forget it.
Just use the Wiimote.
I think that sounds like fun.
It does sound like a challenge.
And who doesn't love a challenge?
It sounds like another excuse for G4 to bring out their giant NES controller to do something stupid on TV.
Yippee!
Can't wait.
Out of curiosity, would this sway you to buy this on the Wii, or are you still like, eh, not good enough, I'm still going to get it on 360?
That's right.
That's kind of where I'm at.
I'm like, oh, that's cute, cute, but I may still get it on the Wii.
I'm still on my silly boycott.
I have no room.
And that's where I stand.
Don't worry, Rob.
We won't have to purchase it.
I will get it on the 360, I'm sure.
But I like the prospect of being able to use the old controller.
Why don't they put it on the DS?
They need to put another Mega Man collection on the DS and release this along with it.
Do you think Capcom might release a remake of the game later on?
I mean, they've never done that before.
Never ever, right?
Do you think there might be a Mega Man 9 Championship Turbo Edition next year?
I doubt it.
You never know.
You never know.
Well, moving forward, and forward is a good way to move.
Konami wants to hop on the old school bandwagon.
Because, well, everyone else is doing it, why can't they?
Well, then again, they were already doing the Castlevania one, right?
Rumored.
But, yeah, well, here's more rumor.
It was actually an EGM put up by WeFanboy.
Said that...
In the September 2008 issue, there will be one of the most beloved yet overlooked action-adventure franchises of yore will soon get a surprise retro-revival sequel.
Hmm.
It better not be Bomberman.
I do love Bomberman, but we've already had Bomberman.
Going on!
It'll be... What if it was Turtles Tournament Fighter?
That would be awesome.
They lost the Turtles license to EA.
That's right.
Damn.
Or it could be... No, they lost it to Ubisoft.
Or it could be... Lucky O'Hare!
Gradius, since they already said they were going to do Gradius.
We did talk about Gradius a couple weeks ago.
Yeah.
Who knows?
How about a bunch of stuff?
How about Blades of Steel?
Actdeft suggests double dribble.
How about Skate or Die?
Was that a Konami game?
I don't think it was.
No, it was Ultra Games.
So that was Skate or Die.
Maybe.
We'll see.
I don't think they would do that game.
Earthworm Jim Earthworm Jim
Remember the opening to Earthworm Jim?
I love that.
Some other things.
Ys Book 1 and 2 will be coming out.
And Samurai Showdown 2.
Yes, that was the best one.
Wasn't Ys a CD game?
Or am I wrong?
I would like to say that the East Book 1 and 2 came out on CD.
So the two games were released as a single CD.
Have we gotten CD games here yet?
Yes.
We have?
Oh.
They got Dracula X in Japan, didn't they?
Yeah, I knew they were coming.
I just didn't know we had any yet.
That's awesome.
But no, the Ys games are good now.
Yeah, I might actually... I don't have room for Ys.
You know what, Rob?
I'll tell you what.
Just come over to my house.
We'll hook up the PC engine.
Deal!
Anything else, Loki, coming out?
That's it.
Alright.
I thought there might be more.
StarCraft 2 and Diablo 3
Yep, they're going to have achievements as well.
Every achievement earned is going to go towards this Blizzard level that every Blizzard user is going to use.
You could basically think of it like an Xbox Live type thing where you have a gamer score but now you're going to have a Blizzard level.
Achievement Horror Loki, are you excited?
But you don't really play Blizzard games on the computer, do you?
No, well, I used to.
I used to play, like, what was it?
I used to play StarCraft.
Or not StarCraft, World of Warcraft.
Not World of Warcraft.
Warcraft!
The original Warcraft and Diablo.
Never played Diablo 2, though.
Should have.
It's interesting.
I was just looking at a chat room here.
Pooface says, too bad the life of a Blizzard game lasts the same of a game console.
I don't know.
It seems like Blizzard games last a long time.
There's still people that freaking play Diablo 2 like it just came out yesterday.
Lieutenant Plissken says, achievements are all the rage these days.
Yeah, kind of.
You see trophies now and pretty soon I'm sure Nintendo will have something as well.
Who knows?
So...
Well, something else that is pretty, this makes me very, very, very happy.
There is a rumor now that Sega is going to be bringing back the Jet Set Radio games.
As we know, there was a Dreamcast one, which we actually got as Jet Grind Radio, and then Xbox had Jet Set Radio Future.
Jet Set Radio Game Boy Advance
What if we had it on the iPhone?
Too tiny.
Too tiny.
They've been quoted as saying, well, the president of Sega is quoted as saying that the iPhone is the new Dreamcast.
Interesting.
Could you imagine doing your graffiti with your finger?
That'd be kind of weird to me.
I don't know.
Yeah, maybe for a little while.
But I don't know.
I do hope the rumor is true, though.
I don't know if I'd be calling the iPhone the new Dreamcast.
That's...
Not a good thing to compare it to.
Well, do you have some more news for us, Loki?
Yeah.
with all these different systems coming out with their own achievement and trophy and whatever systems.
There's actually going to be a new site to track all these at the same time.
It's actually being created by Rooster Teeth, who you may remember from the Red vs. Blue series, among all their other animated Makima series.
But now they have a brand new website that's going to database all these.
And that site is...
What's it called?
Small Rewards.
Achievement Hunter, I'm sorry.
That's what it's called.
And right now I know that they were saying that they're going to do the 360, the PS3, and of course the iPhone, and maybe of course they're going to add on these Blizzard ones as well.
So that's pretty cool.
They'll have to track all these different sites.
I wonder if they're going to have some sort of way to add them all together or something like that.
Is that really necessary?
Yes, it's very necessary.
Actually, it is kind of funny.
I don't know why.
It is.
I think it's hilarious.
DarkTetsuya says, I'm liking the theme music for stories.
You know, I once listened to a gaming podcast.
I don't remember who it was, but they actually play music in the background the entire show, which is cool because I think they play mostly indie bands and stuff, and it makes their show unique, so more power to them.
But just kind of funny.
I never thought of doing theme music for stories.
I think it would be cool.
If we could actually, when we're talking about a certain game, have the music from the game playing in the background.
But that takes a lot of coordinated effort.
You guys don't even know.
I would do it if we could.
But in the meantime, you get Monty Python's Flying Circus.
I don't know what theme music would be appropriate for this.
Maybe something about moving on or something.
Wasn't that a DDR song, Moving On?
Penny Arcade Expo is going to the East Coast in 2010.
That is the current rumor going around.
Actually, it's not really a rumor.
Tycho himself has said that Penny Arcade Expo is going to be going to the East Coast.
And that doesn't mean that the West Coast show is going to go anywhere.
They're turning PAX into multiple places at multiple times type events.
Apparently, it's quoted by the Penny Arcade team has been quoted from saying, frankly, it should be global.
An East Coast show is only the beginning.
So one thing they might announce at Penny Arcade Expo this year is that there's going to be probably an East Coast show next year.
And who knows?
Maybe something in Europe?
Canada?
Who knows?
Somewhere maybe outside the U.S.
Hawaii?
Australia?
Penny Arcade Expo Luxembourg.
Yes.
Penny Arcade, Mozambique.
Wouldn't that be fun?
Monaco.
To Las Vegas or Monaco.
Win a fortune in a game.
My life would never be the same.
Rob.
Ah, yes.
Let's get this part over with.
Yes, it's the mailbag, kids.
Every week you email us.
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
Let's open up the mailbag.
See what you guys have to say this week.
Oh, did we ever get some doozies.
I got to say doozy.
Well, first of all, this comes from Dave.
Hi, Dave!
Hi, Dave.
You can't do that.
Sorry.
Hey, OLR crew, great work on the show.
I was wondering if any of you have checked out GiantBomb.com, the new website from former game spotter Jeff Gertzman and company.
It's basically a potentially awesome game focused wiki.
What do you think of it if you've tried it?
I'm sure there are tons of randomly awesome games on Sega systems in its desperate need of DarkSakura's careful attention.
Love the show and other nice closing pleasantries.
Forgive the shit punctuation.
Oh, you're forgiven.
Dave from ye old England.
You're forgiven.
It's sleek, but here's the thing.
If I want GameWiki, I usually go to Wikipedia.
I'm not exactly sure what is going to make me visit this site on a daily basis, which is what it's all about, right?
That's just some friendly feedback.
I'm not trying to knock the site or anything because it's rather slick.
It's put together rather well.
and I think they'll get a lot of listeners and certainly they have some knowledgeable people from the gaming industry working for it but I'm not sure there's anything there just yet that's going to make me want to click reload every six hours you know what I mean?
Next, our weekly letter from Cheeseburger.
You know you don't have to read every single email.
Yes, I do.
No, mostly.
Hey guys, today I got a subscription to Xbox Live with a headset, camera, and some other stuff, including two arcade games.
I only have Halo 3 and no arcade games, so what arcade games do you think I should get?
I don't like sports and have things like Pac-Man be jeweled in Zuma on my iPod.
Well, if you're listening to Part A, I would tell you to go right now and get Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 because I think it's probably the best game on Xbox Live Arcade right now.
There's Symphony of the Night.
which is also a great game if you don't have a PS1.
Also, good games.
If you like music games, which a lot of our audience does, I don't know where you stand on that.
Not Uno, but Every Extent Extra Extreme, maybe Luminous as well, would both be good things to look into.
Boom Boom Rocket, if you like music games.
If you're not so much on music games, if you like role-playing games, the Penny Arcade game is actually pretty low-worthy, although it is a little more pricier.
But stay away from some of those retro classic change games.
I do like the Pac-Man, though, Tournament Edition.
Oh, God, yes.
Thank you, chat.
Run, do not walk, Res HD.
Yeah!
Which could also very well be the best game on Xbox Live Arcade.
It is a virtual tie with Geometry Wars 2.
They are both great.
So run, do not walk.
Rez and Geometry Wars.
Pac-Man Championship Edition, honestly.
Whether you have the original on your iPhone or not, the Actdeft, I completely agree with what Actdeft is saying in chat.
It doesn't matter if you already have the original version.
It's different enough.
The only thing better than that, though, was the GameCube Pac-Man Versus.
But you don't get that on Xbox Live, so make do.
So next up, hello Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.
Hello, emailer.
First things first, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy listening to your show.
Not all gaming podcasts are created equal, and yours is a testament to that.
Thank you.
DarkSakura correctly pointed out that they are a business and their primary concern is making money, but I fear that their current hard-on for casual gamer is going to come back and bite them in the ass.
The casual market is supporting them, but it will not sustain them.
The Wii has the lowest attack rate of all the current-gen consoles.
The fact remains that it is still the hardcore gamers who are the lifeblood of the gaming companies.
Nintendo has the most loyal fanbase of any of the big three, but if these hardcore fans are made to feel more and more alienated, not all of the Mario and Zelda sequels in the world will keep them from defecting to another camp.
that can offer them more, and by more I mean hassle-free online and disk-based storage.
As someone who grew up with an NES controller in my hands, it disappoints me to see Nintendo apparently dropping me for kindergartners and soccer moms, and I now know I am not alone in this.
Loki will back me up, I'm sure.
Keep on rocking like the proverbial hurricane, raw fish and beer.
This email is brought to you by Mixed Metaphors, home of the ass-biting hard-ons.
Really?
That's the best home of thing ever.
The beat goes on when Nintendo.
Beat goes on.
Next up.
Hey, OLR.
Hi.
I know Rob is a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and I wanted to know what his reaction was to the news of MTV creating a remake of the classic film.
If he didn't know yet, I'm sorry to be the bearer of what I see as terrible news.
Harry.
Yeah, it's...
I don't like to judge things until I see them or watch them or play them or whatever, but in this case, you just kind of know.
Remember the old Animaniacs segment?
Good idea, bad idea?
Bad idea, this right here.
This is my thought, though.
Okay, we saw the redone play, right?
Yes.
And that was good.
What if they had it carry, I guess, the updated music of the new play, but keep the feel of the old one?
Again, I don't want to judge it until I've seen it.
A casting choice is very important, a lot of it that goes into it.
And I don't want to say that everything MTV touches necessarily turns to shit, because, you know, rock band's cool.
But then again, this is the network that brought us The Hills.
I mean shit, enough said, right?
This is the network that started reality TV.
I think this is kind of unnecessary, but it's also inevitable at the same time.
If it ain't broke, don't
I liked the idea better five years ago when the rumor was that the guy who did Priscilla Queen of the Desert was going to be remaking it with Alan Cumming playing Frank and Furter.
Oh my god, wouldn't that be great?
See, I was totally fine with that.
That would just be... Now we're five years later and the rumor's a little less cool.
So, we'll see.
SSJ100Matt says, OLR needs a Wheel of Morality segment.
We do!
Wheel of Morality, turn, turn, turn.
Show us the lesson that we should learn.
Love it.
Email, YoOLR, this be the GS68 Enough of the speaking in ghetto speak.
In response to Actdeft's call last week, how people who play rock bands should learn real instruments, I'd like to say that
People who play Wangan or Initial D should invest shitloads of money in a real car and then illegally street race down Highway 101 at 200 miles an hour.
People who play Pokemon should capture real animals and train them.
Hi, PETA.
Well, that's okay.
PETA's a bunch of psycho assholes anyway.
People who play GTA should learn to hijack cars and kill people in real life.
Hi, he who shall not be named.
People who play Mulana should explore real life ruins and get killed in the process.
People who play Shoot Em Up should invest in a real space fighter jet.
Oh wait, those don't exist.
That is all, GS68.
P.S.
This email is brought to you by Tekken, home of the never-ending stages.
DJ Ratchet makes a good point going back to the hills.
The hills makes the soup funny.
That is true.
Without MTV, the soup would not be nearly as funny.
Oh, yes, to that other email.
There's more email.
Okay, more email.
Actually, Rob with 2B sent us a couple of stories.
Yay.
And this one I think is hilarious.
It's the top seven irritating female characters in video games.
So if the stupid ad would ever disappear because I fucking hate ads.
You know what?
I'm about to just say screw this because I hate ads.
Stop.
Someone's got to pay the bills.
Number seven is Ashley Williams from Mass Effect.
I don't know.
I didn't play Mass Effect.
Six is Minnie Mouse.
I guess I'm talking about... Mickey Mousecapade was awesome.
Yeah, Mickey Mousecapade.
Screw whoever wrote that.
Ashley Graham from Resident Evil 4.
Moving forward.
God, the internet sucks.
Sorry.
Four is Mikiko Ebihara from Daikatana.
And then... Stupid webpage.
Next up is...
It looks like... Catalina from Grand Theft Auto 3.
And then the Beggar Lady in Assassin's Creed.
And then our last ones on the list.
Number one is Navi from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
Hey, listen!
Hey, listen!
Hey, listen!
Hey, listen!
So, uh...
Hey, Yuna was not annoying!
That was my roommate contributing there, Yuna.
That was awful.
She needed to die.
No!
Wow, I think that's like the first time I think my roommate's kind of gotten into the video game discussion here on the program.
Usually he turns his nose up at the show.
He's cooking something that smells delightful right outside the door, though.
Yeah, what's funny is we have the Vornado bringing out... That's how we finally fixed our air conditioning problem.
We bought a Vornado to suck in air conditioning from the house and blow it out here.
But tonight, since the roommate is cooking... It sucks and it blows.
His very delightful dish is... We can smell nothing but that out here because it's sucking air from the kitchen.
Anyway, sorry.
So another one from Rob.
I haven't really read the article, but he said, I got this link in GamePolitics.com.
A judge disenfranchises the class in class action suit.
And it's about the Grand Theft Auto thing.
I'll link it in the chat room.
I'm actually a little surprised since the original suit was not over state laws, but just about getting more than you paid for.
I'd rather be broken by proving the class didn't actually exist.
I also retract my E3 2008 is boring comment.
If you really dig into the third party games and the non-big announcements, there are a lot of good information.
My original opinion was based all on the A-list games news being leaked to the interwebs.
So it was spoiled for me.
Level up, you now have three character points to apply towards your stats, Rob.
With two Bs.
And I'm just looking at this article real quick.
Can I put three points in awesomeness?
Okay.
Okay.
um it said that the settlement over the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas um uh settlement was actually hitting a snag because they're saying on there that the those who were to benefit from the uh
That class that they're referring to actually isn't there.
Because not everybody knew about it until something came out on the internet.
But I'll link this in the chat room.
It's an interesting little article.
For anyone who's interested, just go to... It's actually on the New York Times blog where I linked it to me in the technology section.
Just look up Settlement Over Sex Scenes in Grand Theft Auto Hits a Snag.
I'll link it in the chat room.
That's it.
Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Alright.
It's dot com.
We have a couple more news articles for you guys, and then we're going to be opening up the Skype line.
1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Yeah.
It's not just coincidence.
Well, it's only fair since Rock Band's getting really awesome peripherals from a third-party company, that Guitar Hero World Tour gets...
Awesome peripherals from a third-party company.
The third-party company providing these would be Logitech, and of course they already make the USB microphones that are used by almost all of the music games out there right now.
They're going to be doing some high-end guitars and drum sets as well.
No word exactly what features these will have, but if it's Logitech, you can probably guess it's going to be put together at least pretty well.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see when they show these off.
Yay, more peripherals to put on the Best Buy shelves and other gaming stores to take up space.
Well, these things are damn expensive.
I mean, if it's anything like that $299 drum set, which I do still want.
I don't know why, because I don't play Rock Band, but I want it anyways.
Speaking of music games, I've been kind of brainstorming how I would make a game like Beatmania 2DX work, and I've thought about a game that would combine Beatmania 2DX and poppin' music.
I think it would be actually kind of cool.
I just wish I had a game company to make it for me.
Moving on.
Not that anyone cares.
But Jamie's going to care about this one.
This is a news article just for you, DarkSakura.
Yes.
It's about Ragnarok Online.
Not just that, but Ragnarok Online DS.
Now here's the thing.
This was announced quite some time ago, and now we're starting to wonder, is this game ever going to come out?
Well, here's the thing.
Ragnarok Online on the DS, it's not actually going to be an MMO.
You don't get to play it with other people.
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be.
Right, and that kind of makes sense.
But it is going to be a single-player role-playing game that apparently has some online features in it, whatever that means.
Some screenshots have come out for the game this week as well, and it does have that same chibi style that you've come to know and love from the original Ragnarok Online.
I looked at the pictures and I saw a bunny band.
Apparently you do have gestural attack inputs.
You use the stylus to kind of draw your attacks and things like that.
December 18th is the day this comes out overseas.
Import!
I bet you will.
You know I will.
I know you will.
Whether or not I can read most of it or not.
You know what I know will happen right now is that we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and we're going to take a few calls here on this Part B of our show tonight.
We actually kind of jammed through the stories part of our show tonight.
It's only about 8.15 on the West Coast.
That's not bad.
Because here we've got a 10-minute late start tonight.
That's not bad at all.
For a moment I thought you said on the East Coast.
I'm like, wait, what?
No, no, no.
8.15 here.
But usually we don't get to the skyline until like 9 o'clock.
So we're doing good tonight.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
It's not ringing right now.
So, Loki, do you have any last- I should start with DarkSakura.
Do you have any last-minute stories for us?
No, not really.
Loki?
Loki?
I haven't really been looking at last minute stories.
Oh, here's some.
Yay.
Sony's Life.
You may remember that as their version of the globe spinning news thing.
So that's not coming out right away.
It's been delayed.
Wow, surprise.
Sony delaying something?
Yeah.
Anyways.
Rock Band, download content.
We've got some stuff coming out this week, including Crew Fest Pack 2.
And we're going to be getting with that Face Down in the Dirt by Motley Crue for 80 points or a dollar.
Rescue Me by Buckcherry, another 80 points or a dollar.
And Life is Beautiful by 6AM.
And that's also 80 points or a dollar.
Whole Pack for $2.40 or $3.
and then each they're going to have individual songs for BYOB from System of a Down for two bucks and Toxicity from System of a Down also two bucks and you remember those were part of the System of a Down exclusive download content for when you bought their album so that's kind of interesting
LastGuy.jp
Skyline's open and no one's calling.
That's weird.
I just checked it to make sure it works.
I call 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Well, it happens sometimes.
I was supposed to be looking up stories, but I was working on trying to get the Wiimotes to work with that Love is Blind game.
You know, the one that makes the sex noises.
Apparently my Bluetooth adapter says, Fuck you, Wiimote.
I ain't working with you, bitch.
So now we get to play the chat.
No, we can.
They have a keyboard version, too.
Oh, well, hooray.
That's a little bonus thing after the show, right?
Yes.
I found, by accident, a funny MMO that's all about getting laid and partying.
Right.
It's some sort of social networking thing, but I thought it was hilarious.
It was called Red Light Center.
I just thought it was funny.
I don't think I'm going to play it, but I think it was funny.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
The only other story I had was Ubisoft localizing Armored Core 4 Answer for the US, and it should be coming out in September, and that's kind of cool, I guess.
Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by Armored Core 4.
I don't know if I'll pick this up.
Probably not, but I don't know.
Can't get too excited anymore.
I used to love Armored Core games.
You just buy every single one that came out, but
Oh well.
Oh, I guess I did miss a game that was supposed to be coming out on the Wii and DS this week.
Little League World Series 2008.
I know, sad.
Oh, and this week on Xbox Live Arcade, we've got Braid for like 15 bucks.
Is that game supposed to be cool?
It looked kind of neat from the previews.
It's supposed to be pretty cool.
You can kind of like, imagine like a 2D platform game with the Sands of Time built into it.
Finally, our phone's ringing.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, did you like the pictures I sent?
Yes, they were really hard to see on my phone.
I liked the, was it, you sent me Knights or Riala, one of them.
I think I sent you both.
I got a Frankenfurter one.
I know.
I see, I see, Scott, I see.
I also got a Bubble Bobble.
Heart.
One, there you go.
Heart.
Right, I heart NY, there you have it.
All right, so how was the con?
What con was it you went to?
It was called what?
Kineticon.
Kineticon.
How was that?
Much better than I thought it was.
It gave me a Fanime feel to it, so you know what that means.
I'll be going back to that convention next year.
Aw, Fanime's a good time.
Fanime's a great con artist.
I got there like late Friday night because I had to work and I missed my bus.
But I got there Saturday.
I left my camera.
It showed up about an hour later.
It wasn't as packed, but it was just like really roomy, really flowing.
And then when I got to the room, my roommate tells me, oh, there's going to be furries here.
What?
That was exactly my reaction.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Ranma, but did you not say that you missed the bus?
Yeah, good Friday.
I missed the bus.
I was stuck waiting at Greyhound for about almost an hour to get my ticket changed.
I see what you did there, sir.
I couldn't help it.
I'm sorry.
I know it's probably not funny.
But in years, you'll look back and laugh at it.
It's all good, man.
It's all good.
Well, I have to ask, what gaming things were going on at the convention?
Would you believe I saw DDR?
Oh my, at an anime convention?
DDR you don't say.
Let me guess, was there Smash Brothers?
Yes there was.
I'll be damned.
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
Was there Guitar Hero?
No.
I'm on a fucking roll.
Look at this.
I'm like the psychic con man.
Was there a Naruto game?
Actually, not in the dealer's room.
One of the gaming dealers was showing off one of the Naruto games for PlayStation 2.
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Psychic con man.
Hold on, hold on.
Was there a woman overweight dressed as Sailor Moon?
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Was there an overweight man dressed as Sailor Moon?
I actually know, believe it or not, there really wasn't any overweight people.
There was, but most of them were wearing Lolita outfits and long corsets.
Because KineticCon is a combination of a majority of a webcomic convention with anime, sci-fi, fantasy.
I forget his name, but the guy that played Neelix on Voyager was there.
Ethan something, isn't his name?
You didn't get me his autograph, did you?
I had no money.
I didn't even know he was here until I showed up Saturday.
Okay, I forgive you.
I'm getting you Amino's autograph.
I mean, that should be something.
I found my book.
Finally, I found my book.
Woot.
Yes, DJ Ratchet, there was anime.
Tons of it.
I'll be sending you my book.
Ranma, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, okay?
You too.
Later.
That's great.
Something tells me the callers are fairly apathetic tonight.
Thank you, Ethan Phillips.
That's his name.
The other one.
You know what?
Tuvok is from Sacramento.
I've never seen him, but I see stories about him on the local news once in a while.
Celebrity Tim something.
What's his name?
Tim something?
What the hell is Tuvok's name?
I don't remember.
Oh, well.
Let's go to the phones.
We have another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
Oh my god, we got through.
Yes, we did.
Whoa, we've got like a party chat on the line.
Introduce yourselves.
Oh, this isn't like a party line from like the 80s or something?
I know.
It's party chat.
We should meet up at Chuck E. Cheese afterwards.
Who's on the line?
We've got Toshin, FootyMonster, JackRansom, and TheRobD.
Wow, it's like an all-games party line.
It is a party line.
Awesome.
Call 1-900.
1-900.
It's always a party.
That's the way it rolls.
To what do we owe this phone call tonight?
I just wanted to say I beat your deadline score on Geometry Wars and you're going down.
F you.
F you.
I just did it like five seconds ago.
Geometry Wars brings out the most competitive in all of us, doesn't it?
How about my pacifism score?
Dude, I played pacifism for an hour trying to get that stupid wax off achievement.
Have you beat my pacifism score?
I don't think so.
At least I'm still cool at something.
Thanks for watching!
It's so crazy.
You don't pause the game at all.
Just while you're playing it, hit the right bumper, not the trigger, but the bumper.
Hit right bumper and the back button, and you can render the field in 3D.
It's so cool.
And then if you touch the dot in the room with the dragon ducks, then you can see created by Warren Robinette, and it's awesome.
It's like that.
But in 3D, dude.
3D.
How do you go back?
Because now it's in the middle of my game.
Hit right bumper and back again.
Geometry Wars Geometry Wars Geometry Wars
I'm totally screwed.
I called Microsoft.
They said, basically, well, fuck you.
We don't care.
So I'm out of $500 and a 360.
It's awesome.
That sucks.
That is crappy customer service.
I mean, I understand you're an original.
I didn't really do business with it.
I tried messaging through Twitter to Major Nelson to try my luck there.
Of course, nothing happened.
Yeah, he probably gets 500 emails a day.
It sucks, though.
I will say this before I end my part of talking here, because I know you probably have a lot more calls to take.
Actually, not really tonight.
Rhythm Heaven or Rhythm Tengoku Gold on the DS, you guys need to play that.
I know there's a lot of Rhythm fans in the audience, Rhythm game fans.
You need to play that.
It's like the WarioWare game of Rhythm games, and it's so fun.
Tell us really quickly, is that what the game's like, WarioWare?
Yeah, imagine each stage, four or five mini-games per stage, with a final stage being a remix.
Each game is totally different in gameplay, and it's a small song, or a small thingy.
And from that, you advance the remix stage, and in the remix you play all those mini-games crumpled together into one cohesive song.
So you gotta switch gameplays on the fly all the time.
and it goes like that for many, many levels and it's so fun.
Great music, really catchy, the action on the cellos works perfectly and it's so fun.
Alright.
Sounds pretty cool.
I've just been playing an old copy of Super Robot Wars Alpha I got from a friend a while ago since I'll be going to Otakon next week to see Jam Project and actually I'm going to meet up with Rama probably.
DJ Dark Knight was too lame to go even though Rama and I offered to pay his way
What about games you've been playing, JackRansom?
Well, my PSP miraculously, after a year and a half, fixed itself this weekend, so I decided I'd go out and pick up Patapon.
Pata, Pata, Pata, Pawn Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom That game is nuts It's freaking nuts and I absolutely love it I forgot how many god damn great games there were on the PSP You start hearing those little drum beats in your sleep if you play that game long enough It's terrible, you're lying there trying to go to sleep Pawn, Pawn, Pata, Pawn Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom I cannot wait to get to that stage because at the moment I need more of that game, I want more of that game I'm loving it
Hooray for PSP getting a lot of good games lately.
It's great.
Sorry, go ahead, Toshin, real quick.
I said Summer of Arcade for Xbox Live.
I'm going to be broke.
That's all I'm saying.
For real.
I don't know about that Braid game.
I'll have to check out the demo first because I haven't heard much about it.
But the rest of it looks great.
I know.
I'm going to be broke.
Next week, Galaga Legions the next.
I need money.
You know what though?
If you add it all up, it's the price of Soul Calibur 4.
So honestly, it's...
That also kicks ass.
I highly recommend that for all the Soul Calibur fans.
Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD coming.
Oh, yes.
Hopefully soon.
Toshin, we need to play custom characters in Soul Calibur 4.
Soon.
You going to be around later?
Because I'm around.
I might.
I have a wow date after the show, but maybe later.
We'll talk.
All right.
Take care, guys.
I've got to let you go.
We're going to wrap up the show.
Have a good one, though.
All right.
Bye, party chat.
That's great.
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
Ouch.
My final thought is paper cuts really suck.
