Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Roto.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, August 10th, 2008, Ozzy Osbourne gets ready to rock Guitar Hero,

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
Sega admits to sonic errors, and Grand Theft Auto 4 PC is announced to no one's surprise.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
We are that video game independent podcast on the internet,

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'm one of the three hosts here on Orange Lounge Radio.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
The other co-hosts, with me as always, say hello to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Yo.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
How you doing, Jamie Summers?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
A little warm.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, this is a little warm in studio tonight.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Not terrible, thank god, compared to weeks past.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm having geek issues.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Geek issues?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Geek drama? What type of geek drama?

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
Well, no, I'm just trying to figure out, essentially, how to move over my ringtones and stuff from my laptop,

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
iTunes, to my PC, so that I can start syncing my iPhone from my PC.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Oh, I thought, before the show, you were talking this whole thing about Linux.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I thought your geek issues had to do with Linux, not the phone.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Well, it does. It does, because I've decided that instead of using my PC, putting another drive on my PC,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm going to reformat my laptop to Linux Mint.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Nice.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
So that I can play with it and not have to worry about the Franken-VIO going, ugh.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Is it minty fresh?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
You saw it.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, it looks, it looks fresh.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
It's pretty and useful.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Remember when fresh was a word used to describe cool things?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
That's fresh.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Or crescent fresh? Any Ciffol and Ollie fans in the house?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Hey, the one and only tech master, Loki. How you doing, Loki?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I'm doing fine.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Are you feeling fresh?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I was fresh until this fucking pizza dripped on me.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
So now you're not so fresh?

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
No. See, this is, I think it's the curse for having white shorts.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Ah, it's inevitable.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
It's because, it's like, it's a magnet for shit.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Seriously, it's just like, everything's fine.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
All of a sudden, like, a rogue drop of something will hit, you know, the shorts and...

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
That's all downhill for us.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, it's a good thing we don't have a webcam.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Oh wait, we do, over at JustinTV slash Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
But the good news is, Loki's pants are obscured by the laptop of his and the, so you can't see anything.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
It's too dark in here tonight because we have the lights off for the heat, so...

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
It's just a drop.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I mean, it's just a drop.

02:44.000 --> 02:52.000
It's like, oh, pizza all over me, I'm so stupid, I can't eat.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
We'll also present our always present fourth guest on the show, you, in our chat room,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
when you join us live on All Games Radio at AllGames.com,

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
when we tape Sunday nights right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Although, as of late, Bobby's been running over, eating up our time slot a little bit.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
No, we forgive him, because he always has us on at the end of the show anyway.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
So, you can always check that out on All Games Radio, live on Sunday nights.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
And SSJ100Matt is quoting from Ciffololli, calls, calls, calls, calls from the public, calls.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Anyway, we always love having our chat room on board and the regulars,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
and always some new faces, so please feel free to stop by our chat room,

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com, while we are taking live calls and during chat hours

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
when we're taping live on Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
All right, let's start off the show as we always do.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
How is your gaming week, the types of games you have or haven't been playing this week?

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Maybe if you haven't been playing any games, then what you wish you were playing, dark soccer.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
I actually really didn't, because I had the most craptastic week ever,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
and I had a final, but now that I'm done with school.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I found out, though, that I don't have to report for jury duty,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
so I won't be able to play my Game Boy when I'm supposed to be at work.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
No Phoenix Wright for reals?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I really wanted to get on a trial. I really wanted to get on a trial.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
It is fascinating stuff. Everybody should do it at least once in their life.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
I want to be civic-dutied. Anyway, however, I do actually,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I did sit down and start playing Oh And On a little bit more,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
and I'm still playing Aurora Faint on my iPhone, which is craptastic.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
That game is fun. And Sudoku. And Ragnarok.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Rag to crack.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I noticed that when you were showing me the Linux Mint,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I think you seemed to be very excited, because there was a picture of it

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
flipping between two windows, both of which had Ragnarok on them.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Part of the deciding factor for me having a Linux boot

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
is if I can play Ragnarok on line item or not.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
So is that so you can run your storefront in one window,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
and so you can quest in the other? Is that what it is?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Well, no, because I play on private servers. All I have to do is auto trade.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh, I see.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
And it'll vend while I am gone.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
But no, it's just so that I really want something that runs a lot,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
well, it runs a lot more efficiently.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I just need to make sure that my system is going to be okay with it

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
for me to make the switch.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
And right now I have to figure out, because I've tried doing this before,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
trying to get my iTunes, my ringtones and contacts and everything

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
to sync on my newer computer.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And so far iTunes said, ah, fuck it.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
So as soon as I get that to work, I can reinstall on my laptop

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
and see how that goes.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Well, I am considering upgrading the computer here in studio, actually.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm going to talk more about next week's plan in just a minute,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
but since it's likely we're not going to be here with the show next week,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I'm thinking about taking the time to upgrade the computer here in studio

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
because I have my eyes on some quad core systems and some fancy stuff.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Well, you can tell it's old because it's that off-white color

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
because all the computers nowadays are black.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, they're black now.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Black is the new off-white.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Exactly.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
You can.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Anything else?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
It also doesn't have a window and excessive lights in it.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Anything else you want to share about your gaming week, DarkSagra?

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
My annoyments with my husband because he still hasn't got me

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
to The World Ends With You, and he was supposed to, and he didn't.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Liar.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
I have it with me if you wish to play it during the break.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Okay.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
There was a whole lot of GTA-ing going on in the house.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
But you still won all to yourself.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
The World Ends With You for you.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yes, I do. For me.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
For you.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
To have.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Comments in chat.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
DreadLockLord says, Sky, get an Alienware,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
and SGA100Matt says, Alienware is overpriced.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Just build one from scratch.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Exactly.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
I'm thinking of doing the scratch thing,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
but damn, there are some good deals in those package systems.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
It is so tempting.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
What?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Newegg.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm thinking about it.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
It's not.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I am actually, oh, God, I hate to.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
I'm gonna get so many nerdy emails from nerds everywhere that say I'm stupid,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
but I'm actually, I have my eye on a gateway.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
It's really cheap, and it's really good.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I only bought a gateway.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Listen, I know this is radio, but I just got the look of shame, like, twice.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Listen, I have a gateway laptop.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
That's because you can't build a laptop from scratch.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
And trust me, I looked.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I was going to build one from scratch, even if it's the ugliest piece of shit thing ever.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
As long as I built it from scratch.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
But no, I got this because it was an open box, and it was just,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Bryce was right at the time, so.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
Actually, I have a, one of my friends does a little bit of laptop tweaking

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
and can build a Mac as long as it has the right hardware in it.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I got my iBook.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
That's enough Mac for me, for the house.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
I'm actually, as soon as I get money set aside for it,

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
I'm having him help me with building a Mac from scratch.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
What kind of hardware is required?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
A heating element for toast?

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
You know what, I want a Mac because I deal with artsy stuff all the time,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
and I need it, so, shut up.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
And I'll tell you what, having edited movies on PC and Mac now,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
it's so much easier on the Mac.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
It is so much easier to edit movies on the Mac.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Anyhow, look.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Not every computer is meant for games, duh.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Back to games for a minute.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
My gaming week was alright.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
I didn't play too much.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Had my eye on.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
I was trying to catch up with stuff that I meant to play.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
This week I did check out Braid because I was like,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
hmm, I haven't made a random purchase online yet.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Random!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
There you go.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Buy that.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
So I bought it.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
I think, you know, because the big thing right now is that

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
$15 isn't worth it.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I think everyone's kind of not really concerned whether this game's worth $15,

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
but when these games that are $15 start selling,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Microsoft goes, oh, so they'll pay $15.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Okay, we're going to make all of them $15, and now $20.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Oh, they'll pay $20.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
We'll make them all $20, and now $25.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
It's like the price of gasoline.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I was just saying something about this the other day.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You know how gas prices have been coming down lately,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
and it's about, what, $3.90 a gallon locally now?

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And everybody's going, hooray, gas is under $4 a gallon, hooray.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And I'm like, that's what they want you to think.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
They want you to think you're getting a good deal,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
but you've got to remember a year ago it was $2.90,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
and even that was high.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
So don't buy into that.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Exactly, and that's what's going on with this,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
is I think the gamers are trying to tell Microsoft,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
hey, listen, we're going to buy this game,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
but we don't expect all these games to be $15,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
and we're not going to fucking buy all of them.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
And all that being said, I think Braid is worth $15.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Absolutely.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
I would say it's worth $10, but that's about it.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
And the only reason, because it's quick.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I mean, I know you said you had a little bit of problems with it.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Because I'm stupid, and it takes me a long time

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
to figure out these puzzles.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I'm almost all the way through the game,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
and it's only been about two hours,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
and it's just, I mean, there's some of the puzzles

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
later on are a little bit tricky,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
but the first few ones I kind of figured out

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
what they want me to do really quick.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And I kind of look back at this and like,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
okay, there's going to be speed runs you can do

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
throughout the game, but that's really the only replayability.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Quickly though, because I knew nothing about Braid,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
absolutely zilch about this game.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I think I might have heard it mentioned

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
like out of a game developer's conference once or twice,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
but about the game itself, I knew nothing about it

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
except that it was supposedly this really critically acclaimed game

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
until I got my hands on it this week.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
So for those of our listeners who have no Xbox 360,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
what is this game all about?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I want to hear the low-key version of this.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
It's about this dude who's going around

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
and being all emo about the fact that he lost somebody

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
and he's like searching for something.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
To be honest, it's like, text, text, text,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I'm walking past it all, you know.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
But, yeah, thank God he can bypass the story.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
I read it, okay, but I was just like,

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
okay, my whole thing is there's one of them

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
that sounds like he had a wife or something

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
but now he's going after some other chick

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
and he left her to go find this old flame or princess or whatever,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
and I'm thinking, you're just going to realize

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
that you lost your wife because you're an idiot.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
But then at the same time, this guy is some crazy dude

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
that's got a tie in walking through this world

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
that's a rip-off of Super Mario Brothers, you know.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
But the game is nothing like Super Mario Brothers.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
That's the thing, though, I know.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
But at the same time, it is, I don't know,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
it's got really cool, unique gameplay elements to it.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
You know, Portal could take notice of this,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
and maybe this would be perfect for, you know, Portal 2.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
But, I don't know.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
There are some things, though, that I did read

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
that there's eight hidden stars in the game,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
which may unlock some more stuff later,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
which would be kind of cool.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
But there's just, once you're done with the game,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I don't see it really going, I guess it's like Portal a little bit,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
you know, you don't really go back.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
But they built the speedrun thing into it,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
the speedrun contest, which I thought was kind of interesting.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Like, once you beat it once, you can go through and do the speedruns,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
but I'm too stupid to beat it even once.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I mean, this game makes you feel like a dummy.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
At least, if you're me.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
But there's a certain factor when you're playing through the game, at least.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I don't know about you, but there were certain puzzles

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
that were frustrating the hell out of me.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Like, I was getting in that whole, like, old school,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
like, I'm gonna throw the Nintendo controller at the screen mode.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
But when I solved it, I was like,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
yes, I'm awesome, I solved the puzzle, you know what I mean?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Like, there was definitely some rewards to it.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I've actually not used any online game facts

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
or anything like that to get through the game.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I've just been playing it normal and just trying to figure out.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
You're smart! You got more pieces than I do.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Well, you know, I'm also trying to be a completist,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
so I won't continue on until,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
unless that last level, because I got pissed off with it,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
so I just ran all the way through it.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Yeah, I just ran all the way through all the levels once,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
and then I went back and tried to beat them.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
But, you know, I don't know.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
It would be cooler if it was longer.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Hopefully they'll have some download stuff later,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
because that would be pretty cool for it.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Anyways, enough with Braid.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
I also played this week the demo for Battle Fantasia,

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
which is like this weird medieval anime fighting game type thing.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It was okay. I don't know.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I've heard about that game. What do you think of it?

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
It's pretty. I mean, it's all 3D and stuff.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
But it was alright.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
They have two characters you can play as.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
One has this chainsaw thing,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
and the other guy is this little kid in knight's armor,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
and he's fighting and stuff.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
It's alright. I'm not really in the fighting game,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
so it was just okay for me.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
But, you know, it's pretty.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
It looks a lot better than I thought it would.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
If you're looking for another game to pick up,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
other than maybe Soul Calibur IV or something like that,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
this you might like.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Check it out.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Then Grand Theft Auto IV.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
I also got my 360 back from Microsoft being repaired.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
It was actually really quick, which I was surprised.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
So that went pretty well.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I kept the old box just in case another one dies,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
so for a track record it's been like 5 out of 6,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
or 7 if you include the new one I bought.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
So, yeah, that's about it.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
I'm definitely looking forward to this week for Bionaut Commando.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Oh, is that this week?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
That's this week.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Oh, that should be fun.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Xbox did a good thing with this whole Xbox Live Arcade for August,

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
because between Geometry Wars 2 last week,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
which I'm still playing,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
and Braid this week, I'm busy.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I've barely been touching Soul Calibur.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I think the only time I played Soul Calibur at all this week

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
was when one of the listeners wanted to do some fighting,

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
which I did.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah, I didn't get to play a lot this week,

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
because I was actually...

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm sorry, I felt bad,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
because another listener wanted to battle me,

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
and I was too into Braid.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
I just ignored all the messages that were popping up,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
and I'm like, oh, I should go look at them.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Oh, the poor guy wants to play Soul Calibur,

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
and here I am all sucked into Braid.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I don't know, this week I didn't get to play a lot,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
because I was doing some video editing

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
for something I'm making for work,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
and I also didn't get to work on the PSP website at all,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
but it's coming along, I promise.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I'm just working on a bunch of small stuff, unfortunately,

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
and then maybe I'll try to finish the bigger stuff first.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
I don't know.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
That's it.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I've been looking a lot at Singets Row 2, though.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I mean, the more stuff I see for it, the cooler it looks,

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
and I'm really excited to play that game.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
All right.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
My Gaming Week, as I already mentioned,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Braid, I think Braid is absolutely worth it.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I'm sure $15 is fine.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
I want to refrain from trying to use the Penny Arcade argument

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
that they posted earlier this week about the whole,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
well, you'll spend $15 on a shirt,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
so why not spend $15 on a game?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I'm taking a different approach,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
and if you were listening to Bobby's show a minute ago,

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
I'm going to use the same thing,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
so I apologize to our listeners live who were hearing it twice,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
but, you know, I went and saw The Dark Knight,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
and I paid $10 to see The Dark Knight,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
because movie prices are insane right now,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
and that's not even counting the price of an IC

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
and candy and all that shit,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
so I paid $10 to see The Dark Knight,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
which entertained me for two and a half hours,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
and Braid's already entertained me that long,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
you know, just through the little bit I've played of it.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
I know people that have gone to see The Dark Knight three times,

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
meaning they've paid $30 to see the same two and a half hours.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Don't get me wrong.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I'm not bashing The Dark Knight, great movie,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
but why is it okay to spend $30 there,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
but yet $15 feels like such a ripoff?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Because it's apples and oranges.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I get what you're saying.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I completely understand what you're saying about the whole,

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
you don't want to set a precedent for Microsoft,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
because especially the fact that, okay,

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
then there's games like Fusion Frenzy 2 that cost, what, $50,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
that entertained me for 30 seconds,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
the amount of time for the logo to get on and off the screen.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
It's a retarded argument.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I understand what Penny Arcade was trying to say,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
but it's fucking a retarded argument.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Oh, snap, all right.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Oh, well, let's go to Disneyland,

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
because you can spend a day there that's, you know,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
about eight hours, and you spend $100,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
so let's charge $100 for every fucking online game,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
because it's, you know, over eight hours of entertainment.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
That's retarded.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
However, however, however,

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
I can absolutely disprove that there's any validity to that argument,

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
because going to Disneyland is like paying for 30 MMOs.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Yeah, and going to Disneyland has Space Mountain.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
End of story.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
End of argument.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And California Screamin'.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
All right, fine, you pay $50 for, you know, console games.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Why can't you pay $50 for this online game?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I know it's only, you know, six hours long or eight hours long,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
but some console games, because they suck,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
are only eight hours long as well.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
And some, and to be honest,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
this may actually have a little bit more polish

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
than some of the stuff that ends up on the Wii.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
For real.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
That's what I'm saying.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
That's why I'm like, $15 is not a bad price,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
but I do agree, we don't want to set a precedent,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
but I think those games that are $15 that are crap

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
are not going to sell.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Like, look at some of the, like that Sudoku game,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
and the, no, no, the Crosswords game.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Wasn't that like 10 bucks?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Has anybody, a quick, quick poll in chat, folks,

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
chat.ownerslonsradio.com,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
did anyone drop 10 bucks on that Crossword game?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
That's what I want to know.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Did you really need the achievement points that bad?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Don't be shy.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
This is a real needy survey,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
because I want to know if anyone dropped $10 on that game.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Now, because it wasn't worth it,

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
and it sends a message.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
And I do give them props for having demos for this stuff,

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
which is nice.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
That's what they really need to do,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
because there's some companies, Nintendo,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
that don't put demos for their games up there,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
and so you buy it, and you're like,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
wow, this sucks.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Can I get my money back?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
No?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Oh, well, fuck you.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
I'm not buying anymore.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I don't know, it's just,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about it,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
because games like this are going to sell well,

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
and they're going to say,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
hey, people are going to be willing to pay this kind of money,

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
so let's raise the price.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Oh, well, we'll just use the excuse that my game's,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
you know, small, and I'm an independent publisher,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
and if you don't buy my game at $15,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I don't make any money.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Or, you know, oh, you know,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
development costs are going up more,

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
and oh, we need more money for this stuff.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Dude, I mean, development costs for a game,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
no offense, the art style's awesome,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
the engine's pretty cool, you know,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I'm sure that took some time,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
but seriously, there's like,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
they're goombas, okay?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
They're piranha plants.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
There's so much more to it than that.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
All right, look, we're just going to have to disagree.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
That happens sometimes when you have three people on a show.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I say it's worth it, and go spend the money right now.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Nintendo will sue.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I think it's...

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Nintendo has nothing to sue over.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
The game is, it's an homage to Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
and other games.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
What if, in fact, did you notice

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
that the Donkey Kong level was called Jumpman,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
which is Mario's name in Donkey Kong?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
There are these subtle little...

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
What about stories, right?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
All right, sorry, look.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
We have to have an argument.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm telling you, Dark Soccer,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
you really need to check out Braid.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
You really do.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I planned on it, and actually...

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
We need a third opinion.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I added Major Nelson to my Twitter,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
and so he put up a download code up for it.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Did you get it?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
No, I didn't. I was at work.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Oh, then somebody else did cry.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
But I'm just saying, you know,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
if anyone wants to check out some of these games,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
you know, for free as they come up,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
he's doing crap like this all the time on Twitter.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Just pray you're first.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Seriously.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
All right, results of our quick poll in chat.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Did anyone buy the crosswords game?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
No, no, nope, what, hell no, no, no.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I didn't even know there was a crossword game.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Flash games, anyone?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Nope, hell no, no, and so on.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
So I didn't see anyone say yes.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Oh, just kind of throwing that out there.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
All right, the rest of my gaming week,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Geometry Wars 2, WoW, Soul Calibur,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
pretty much nothing else new besides Braid.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
But that's okay,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
because Braid was a worthwhile expenditure this week.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Okay, that's it for my gaming week.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Let's get into tonight's housekeeping.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
My Vegas trip I talked about last week got canceled

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
due to personal reasons, nothing bad.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
It's just, didn't end up being able to do it.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
So, but we're still,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
because some of us kind of banked on there

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
not being a show next week,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
we may still not be here,

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
just especially because like a week or two before PAX,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
we might just kind of take the week off anyway.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
Stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com for the details.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
We'll keep you guys posted

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
if we end up doing anything pre-taped,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
which looks likely or not,

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
but we probably will not be live next week,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
but you never know,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
just stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
That's pretty much that as far as the show goes.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I do want to say, though,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
I thought it was very cool,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
even though I am not going to end up

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
getting to go to Vegas,

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
and I'm going to miss the Star Trek experience,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I did have a listener email me,

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
and I'm sorry, I don't have my email open,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
so I forgot your name,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
but he mentioned that he and his,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
and I forget if it was girlfriend or wife,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I think he said wife,

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
or future wife or something,

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
said that because I mentioned it on the show,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
they bumped up their trip.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
They didn't realize the Star Trek experience

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
was closing and got to go,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
so I just thought that was awesome.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
That made me feel really warm and fuzzy

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
about the power of this show

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
to help out nerds everywhere.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Live long and prosper, my friend.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Have fun, you guys.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
The other housekeeping thing I wanted to say,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
iTunes reviews.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Please be so kind to leave us

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
a five-star review on iTunes.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Just search for Orange Launch Radio.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Leave us a nice review.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
I'll be posting the link in chat shortly

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
if you guys would be so kind to post some reviews.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
We would heart that very muchly.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
It helps, because the more positive reviews,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
it helps the ranking.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
The higher the ranking,

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
the more likely people are to find us,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
and nothing against the shows that are all top-rated,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
but 80% of them are commercial,

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
like G4, 1UP, GameSpot-style casts

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
that don't need that attention.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
They have TV stations and websites and magazines

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
that back them.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
They don't need it.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
You know what's also sick?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
What?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Some of those websites, like IGN,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
run like eight podcasts.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Dude.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
And they're all in the top 20.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
I know.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Seriously.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I know.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
They need eight podcasts.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
All right.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Anyhow.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
To answer Quel Tipo,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
what we endorse is free thought.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
What did Quel Tipo say?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Waterboarding.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
What the hell is that?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
I have no idea,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
but I'm just saying we endorse thinking for yourself.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Waterboarding is where you pour water over someone's face

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
when you're interrogating them,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
and it gives them the sensation of drowning,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
and apparently is some big controversy

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
going on in the government,

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
because they do that, too.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Oh, okay.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I do remember reading a politically oriented story on that now.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
However, what we endorse is thinking for yourself

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
and acting responsibly within the confines

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
of your own concept of morality.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Does that work?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Mm-hmm.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Okay.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Do that.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
All right.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Let's move on.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Ice Cream Man.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Give me...

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Hold on.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
We have to pause the show.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
We hear an ice cream truck.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
All right.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Loki.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Ice Cream Man does not have that kind of base.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
I'm sorry.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
It's the gangsta.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Ice Cream Man.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Although if I had an ice cream truck, you know...

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Loki, gaming news.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Let's get to it.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
If you are an attractive person looking for a cool game,

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
well, you'll be happy to know that tomorrow,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
or Monday, August 11th,

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
the first episode of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Homestar Ruiner, will be coming out,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
and that'll be available on WiiWare and PC,

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
and that's exciting.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Yeah.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
That is very exciting.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Sorry.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Comment and chat.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Kadosho says, yay, ice cream truck.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
It has 150 hit points.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Suma says, so in other words,

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
OLR supports torture?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
No.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
We just support people thinking for themselves

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
and doing whatever they feel is morally and ethically correct.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
Well, some of these past episodes that we've done, well...

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Anyhow, Strong Bad.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
You excited about the Strong Bad game?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
No.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I never was one into, you know, Homestar Ruiner.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
All right, then screw you.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Dark Soccer, I know you like Homestar Ruiner.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
You gonna check out the game?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Hell yeah.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I'm a cool and attractive person.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Are you gonna download it on PC, Rob?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Since obviously you're...

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Yes, I will check it out on PC since I'm having issues.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
I'm gonna get a WiiWare.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Which is a bummer because somebody I know is...

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I don't know how much I should say,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
but I should be getting the Wii one,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
but I'm not.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
I'm gonna get the PC one.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I'm still supporting it one way or the other,

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
and I get to revisit.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Here's the thing.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I haven't even watched Homestar Ruiner in like two years,

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
so it's kind of one of those,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
oh, it's revisiting an old friend.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
So that's my plan.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I demand an Ask A Ninja game.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
You'll never...

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
We'll see. We'll see.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Someday.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Alright.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
So there it is.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Check that out next week.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Meanwhile, or Monday even.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
You don't even have to wait a week.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Meanwhile, also on the Wii,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Rock Band 2, and apparently they are saying that

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Rock Band 2 is not gonna hold back on any of the features

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
that you know from the other Rock Band games,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
meaning like download content.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Hello, that's something the first Rock Band was sorely missing.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
They had to put the bonus songs on the disc

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
and call it like a bonus exclusive.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Apparently, you're gonna be able to download songs,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
do the whole online thing,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
make your own rocker, drummer, whatever.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Apparently, this is coming from Wired magazine.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Wired is saying that the Wii version of Rock Band 2

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
is going to be, and this is right out of Harmonix's mouth,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
fully featured DLC online play.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
It's going to be a much more competitive product.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Do they know something we don't?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I know, exactly.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm kind of curious to see what magic little thing

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
is gonna be implemented between now and whenever

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
this game comes out.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
November?

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
So, very interesting.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
But good news for Wii owners,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
especially those that want to have Rock Band,

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
if you didn't pony up the money for an Xbox or PlayStation 3

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
and this is all you got in your house,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
you won't experience Rock Band,

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
I'm glad to hear, finally, you won't be getting held back.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
No, this is not, wasn't in our show role,

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
but I was gonna mention it anyways,

26:01.000 --> 26:08.000
because there was supposedly the information that

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Rock Band 2's release dates got leaked, apparently.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I think we are talking about that in part B tonight.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Oh, we are?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
You are, actually.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
I am, yes.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
I didn't see it on there.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
So stay tuned.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Oh.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
It's there.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Nevermind.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
We'll talk about it later on.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
I'm jumping ahead.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
See, we have to tease them with something for later.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
So, we'll just have to go, we'll have to go back in time

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
for now, right, Darksyra?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Well, you ready to do the time warp?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Because we've been time warping all over this story.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
It's just a jump to the left.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
What was it?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Remember what we saw at Margaret Cho,

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
talking about her mother going to see Rocky?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Games!

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Darksyra Games.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Alright, well, Mega Man 9, as we know,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
is going to be nest-tastic.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
However, you've got an option to make it even more nest-tastic.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You can make it flicker.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
That's right.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
You can make it flicker as a built-in bug in the game

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
if you so choose to activate it.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
So, for anyone who is so young that they don't know what flicker is,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
this is a good way to discover what we grew up with.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
This is awesome, too, because, like, you know,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
companies like EA and Ubisoft and stuff like that

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
tend to release games that have a few glitches.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Oh, don't worry.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
It was intentional for your save to get deleted.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
It's retro.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
You like retro.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
Well, in this case, you can select if you want it on or off.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
But it's also saying that there's going to be other types of glitches

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
that you would commonly find.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
Because, you know, I found the glitch in Mega Man 3 by myself

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
where you can kill yourself, you jump down a hole,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
and then you hold the left and right buttons

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
so that you do the super jump and you lose all of your life

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
and you can't shoot anything, but you can still use your weapons

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
because you're invincible.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Because you're dead.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
You're undead Mega Man.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
I have to say this from chat because this kind of goes along with the story.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
ActDef says Mega Man 9 will have flickers and bugs.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Yay for Ness.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
Why is this exciting news that we're going to have bugs in the game?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Well, granted, they're optional, but why is this exciting?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It's something that you can pick.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Because the whole purpose of the game is to have the experience

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
of playing one of the old 8-bit versions of a Mega Man game,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
which technically that's what it is.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
You can have it the way the other ones were.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
You can have it the way the other ones were if you want to.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
Why complain about something that you can turn on or off?

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
That earns you the STFU award.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Thank you very much. Drive-thru, please.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
It's not really so much that, but the fact that it's like,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
OMG news, you know what I mean?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I think it is newsworthy.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
It's interesting. I'll give it that.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
I think that it's basically everyone's excited about the attention to details like that.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
I could see that. I could give it that.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I still say?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Fine.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
That's what I say.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
So noted.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Well, put that on the OLR Wiki, please.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
The Dark Soccer's official statement on this episode is...

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
Well, one series that's been known for a few glitches, at least.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
In fact, a glitch-themed musical number that was released on the Internet.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Saints Row.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
Well, Saints Row 2 will not be coming to the Wii,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
which is not surprising.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
Basically, the concerns are over controversy that a game like that may cause,

29:28.000 --> 29:35.000
and also the fact that the graphics on the Wii aren't exactly what they are on the Xbox 360.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
They basically are worried that because if you had Wii controls for, like,

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
chainsaws and satchel charges and stuff like that in the game,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
that you may risk running into an adults-only rating,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
kind of like Manhunt 2 did.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
But, I think that's stupid that they think that scene is,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
there's been games out there that have had similar things already,

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
and been released mature,

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
and have done pretty well, like Scarface, or The Godfather,

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
or, I don't know, No More Heroes, or Mad World that's coming out.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
So, I guess we'll just leave it to graphics.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
I was gonna say, isn't this game just, I mean, controversy aside,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
isn't this game just kind of too much graphically for the Wii?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Yeah.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
That's it then, right? Why play the controversy card?

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
Wouldn't people just accept the fact that the Wii can't handle it, period?

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
I guess, and you know what, what they need to do is have,

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
it's gonna take people releasing a big name game,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
like, another Grand Theft Auto that's on the Wii,

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
before companies decide, hey, the Wii's viable for that kind of game,

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
because right now, even though there has been some mature games on there,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
and they're starting to get a little bit more adult content,

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
it's still perceived as a kid's system, just like the GameCube was,

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
and they're really having trouble getting past that stigmata,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
and Nintendo isn't helping.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
They're definitely not helping with Wii music and shit like that,

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
but it's just, it's really gonna take a big game like Grand Theft Auto coming out on it,

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
before people go, hey, we can release our game on there,

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
and actually make it for the Wii only.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Alright, fair enough. Well, look, one thing that is certainly exclusive to the Wii

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
that we haven't seen on other systems yet is waggling and motion,

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
and motion's about to get even better when Wii Sports Resort comes out,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
and the Motion Plus accessory comes out.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Now, the Motion Plus was developed by a company called InvenSense,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
that actually made this accessory.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
Well, news came out this week that this Motion Plus technology,

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
there is no exclusive deal with Nintendo,

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
meaning that if InvenSense wanted to, they could take this technology to other companies.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Are you listening, Sony or Microsoft?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Now, you know, this instantly makes fanboys think about, you know,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and actually, let me read this official quote that came from it.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
This came from company head Joe Virginia.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
Now, I can't get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
but as you might imagine, of course, there's more interest out there.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
So, you know, rumors have been abounding for a long time

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
that Microsoft was gonna get into the whole motion game,

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
although they didn't at E3, which was the expected time.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
Personally, I don't see the other consoles getting into this whole motion thing and the Motion Plus.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
You know where I bet this accessory ends up turning up?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Again, PC.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
I bet you we see some type of small scale release of this accessory on a PC.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Here's my thing, is like, if you're Nintendo,

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
and you're concerned about having, you know, all your proprietary stuff,

32:34.000 --> 32:40.000
why do you put out this peripheral that's supposed to make things better,

32:40.000 --> 32:46.000
and supposed to make things extremely lifelike, or very sensitive to your movements,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
and then you don't make it exclusive to yourself?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
That's kind of retarded.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
It's like, I made this really awesome invention!

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
That'll make our game system awesome, and no one else can have it!

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Oh wait, no they can.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Now, Game Guru in chat has a comment that's kind of along those lines.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
He says, but Nintendo owns the patent on the pointer,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and that's the big plus for the Wii.

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
Is that, you know, and granted, if this Motion Plus technology were to be adapted by the other companies,

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
they wouldn't be able to do it in that same style that the Wii does.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Yeah, I don't know.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
Really, I mean, I think this is going to be like Rock Band and Guitar Hero.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
Maybe PlayStation will adopt this technology and they'll have 12-axis!

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
They'll just, what they'll do is they'll make something that will work exactly the same.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
It'll be just different enough so that they can't get sued.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
That's it.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Alright, well we'll see what happens.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
Maybe next year's E3. Who knows? Who knows?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
So, let's move on.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
DMN and I are having a fight to the death in the chat room.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
What, why? Over what?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Over Rondo of Blood.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
We're going to have a fight at PAX.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Awesome.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
But I said that I would win, because girls play dirty.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
Which, by the way, all three of us are going to be at PAX in like three weeks from today.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
We are going to be flying home, but we will have just spent the weekend at PAX.

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
He can't use the Elec Beam Pause trick on me because the Blaster Master Grenade trick is stronger.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Gaming news?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I counter with my Konami code.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
They're going to LARP to the death.

34:10.000 --> 34:18.000
LARP to the death? Dude, that would be an awesome band name.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Hey Rob.

34:19.000 --> 34:24.000
What? Let's make a band in Rock Band and call it LARP to the death.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Alright, sorry, gaming news.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
Dragon Quest IV. It gets a date in Europe.

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
Which, okay, I'm wondering where the number thing is, because we've got, what, six over here.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
But they've already had six in Japan, and they're up to, what, eight now?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And whatever the hell.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Nine on DS soon.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
I know! And this is the DS one they're talking about.

34:47.000 --> 34:55.000
Dragon Quest, the Chapters of the Chosen, which is in the trilogy of The Hand of the Heavenly Bride and the Realms of Reverie coming next.

34:55.000 --> 35:02.000
So it's supposed to be released in, okay, here's what it is.

35:02.000 --> 35:10.000
Dragon Quest IV was released on the NES in February 1990, and it was Dragon Warrior IV over here.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
So this is a DS remake is what they're getting.

35:13.000 --> 35:18.000
And they said that they're supposed to get it on September 12th over in Europe.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
So, hey, cool.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
And you get that, you know, fantastic Toriyama artwork.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
So, go for it.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Cool.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
The end. Oh, not just the end. There's more.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
But wait.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
Even more. More money, more prizes. I love it. Anyway.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
Someone gets a dollar if they guess what game that's from.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Smash TV. Where's my dollar?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I've gave you a dollar before.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
You get a retro dollar, so I've already given it to you.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
What can I buy with a retro dollar?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
iTunes Long.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Woo!

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
You can buy flashing graphics in-

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Oh, yeah, I can buy flashing retro graphics.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Remember things the way they used to be.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Chrono Trigger!

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Ooh, yes.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
See, that gets Rob's attention.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
There has been a kind of date given for Chrono Trigger in Europe.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
This is for the DS version.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
They're supposed to get it early 2009, so it's going to be after the US holiday launch.

36:14.000 --> 36:20.000
So we're getting it, of course, for the Christmas slash Kwanzaa slash whatever.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
For Kwanzaa.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Yeah.

36:22.000 --> 36:27.000
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Europe never got Chrono Trigger the first time.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
So this is big for them.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I think the PlayStation 1 came out.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Really?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
I think so.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I thought the Super Nintendo 1 never did, though.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I think you're right.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I could be wrong.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I thought the Europe date disappeared.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Oh, that was for... No, I think that's something else.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
What was it? What else was I going to say? Was there more? I'm sorry.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Yes.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Oh, go ahead.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Rob. Heart.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
What?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Anyway.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
But really, the DS version, the things it's going to have is a touchscreen control.

36:56.000 --> 37:03.000
You can use both the dual screens, a new dungeon, wireless play of some unnamed variety.

37:03.000 --> 37:09.000
And it's actually pretty cool.

37:09.000 --> 37:18.000
And there's also, just if anyone is curious, there is a gallery up on Eurogamer that has screenshots.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
So I'll link that in the chat room if anyone wants to check it out.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
All right, chat.orangesongerator.com if you want to join our chat room.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I thought I knew what it was I wanted to ask you about.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
Because we were talking about old video games and collecting and all that stuff.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
42.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Okay, sure.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Here's the thing.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
I went to a local record store the other day that was having a big video game sale, used video game sale.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
I found Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link, in a gold cartridge for $5.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Is that a good deal?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Yeah, I'd say so.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
I should have picked that up.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
Because I was looking at it going, wasn't that the first Zelda they remade in the gray carts?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
So the gold carts are really valuable?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Or am I crazy?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Valuable, but they're neat.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Especially if you've got the box.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
It would be worth $5 just to have the old school cart.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
We can put it up on the wall in the big blank spot we have on Justin TV.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
I'm pointing at the blank spot.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
The thing to watch out for those is the battery.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Well, I wouldn't play the game.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I don't have an old school Nintendo to play it on.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Well, I told you I was going to lend you one if I can find one.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Can't you replace the battery?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
You can replace the battery, if I'm right.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
I think it just uses a standard small lithium battery.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
We replace the batteries in our Saturn all the time.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
And I mean all the damn time.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Alright, fair enough.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Well, alright, let's move on.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
Sorry to derail the current gaming news, but I just had to know, good deals or not?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
We're doing a public service.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Good deal, bad deal.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Good deal, bad deal.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Your batteries can be saved.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
The store was advertising a huge video game blowout, like it was like five games for $13.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Okay.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
The one that used to be a tower.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
They were advertising a big sale on used games, like five games for $13.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I was like, well, I need to go in and see what it is.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Okay, guess what all the games were that were $5 for $13?

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Sports games.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
All outdated sports games, like NHL, 06.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
All the games where all the servers got shut down.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
They can't get rid of them.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
I went in looking for, what I was looking for in there?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Old NES games.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
They had some in there.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Well, yeah.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
That's where I saw Zelda.

39:14.000 --> 39:22.000
Well, originally, before I bought you Blastworks, my intention was to go there and find an original copy of The Guardian Legend,

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
which obviously wouldn't be there because it's too valuable, but, you know.

39:26.000 --> 39:33.000
The one time I found a cartridge of The Guardian Legend was at that random store that Rama and company took me to in New York City,

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
the one time I went to visit.

39:34.000 --> 39:41.000
But I will tell you what I did find that was freaking awesome that I found at the sale,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
because not only were they selling video games, but they were selling music,

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
and I found for $2 Paula Abdul Spellbound.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Oh, God.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
That was the one with Rush Rush on it, wasn't it?

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Yes, it was.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
I like that song.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
It also had such awesome songs as The Promise of a New Day,

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
which I was trying to play a clip of here on air, but my computer's freezing up on me, which probably...

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
No, it has a taste screen.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Oh, there we go.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
It has a taste screen.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
$2 for this.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
Diet Coke, yo.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Alright, please.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Promise of a New Game, Loki?

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Please stop that.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
There is a pretty cool hack that got released this week on the Wii,

40:24.000 --> 40:34.000
and it will allow you to actually play region-free Wii games with no mod chips whatsoever.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
What this will require, though, is that you have the homebrew channel installed,

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
and when you install this, it will do some other things as well.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
You can play region-free GameCube games, region-free Wii games.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
You can have region-free channels.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
You can also remove the main menu background music.

40:55.000 --> 41:02.000
You can go to the Wii's rescue menu that they use for diagnostics.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
I guess the diagnostic discs.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
And you can also remove the health warning screen that pops up in the beginning when you turn the Wii on.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Well, thank God, because that thing annoys me more than anything.

41:14.000 --> 41:20.000
I believe you have to have Wii system version 3.2, I want to say.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
Unfortunately, if you have it all the way updated now, you can't use this.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
I'm sorry, I can't stop laughing at the fact that somebody actually sat there and said,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
you know what I'm going to do to my Wii?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
You know what project I'm going to take on?

41:33.000 --> 41:41.000
I'm going to get rid of that health warning screen, because dammit, that thing's annoying.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
Meanwhile, people are starving in other countries, and war breaks out.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
But you got rid of the health warning.

41:48.000 --> 41:53.000
Yes, it is. The process to patch it is safe, so you won't brick your console.

41:53.000 --> 41:59.000
The only thing that will happen is if you update your console again, it will erase all these updates that you've just made to it.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
So, that's the only problem.

42:01.000 --> 42:11.000
But they are working on ways to prevent that, and like I said, I think it's only compatible right now with version 3.2 firmware.

42:11.000 --> 42:21.000
Act deaf to saying in chat that patch is only for Europe, Loki, with patch in quotes.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Does anyone really need to remove the health warning screen that bad?

42:24.000 --> 42:31.000
I mean, really? Really? Is it that intrusive? Maybe you should be reading it.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
Anything else in the Wii hacking world going on that we should be aware of?

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
No, that would be it.

42:37.000 --> 42:43.000
Well, anyhow, maybe if we hacked some of the more recent Sonic games, we could actually make them good.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
But some of the more recent Sonic... I'm not talking about classic Sonic. That was always good.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
I'm talking about the more recent Sonic games, and this is kind of amazing.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
And yes, it's newsworthy.

42:53.000 --> 42:59.000
There was an interview this week that Sega's Vice President of Marketing, Sean Ratcliffe, did with Game Daily.

42:59.000 --> 43:09.000
And what apparently Game Daily, in this interview, he says that he kind of admits in a way that Sonic has not been quite as good as it could have been.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I mean, he didn't come out and say, Sonic sucks.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
But there was this interesting quote.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Some of that criticism is probably warranted.

43:15.000 --> 43:22.000
We definitely recognize that a franchise that has been going as long as Sonic, you have to put a huge amount of effort in to make sure that you maintain that quality.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
Which is why you're seeing us this year take the first steps in making sure the quality is right.

43:26.000 --> 43:33.000
And we're constantly looking at innovation, blending classic 2D gameplay with 3D, beautiful, landscape-rich environments.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
So, and then continues on.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
For fans of Sonic that has been looking for the next-gen experience, this is the game they've been waiting for.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
So, I guess all those other games were just like... I like the way he does that with words.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Kind of sweeps the other games under the table.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Oh, no, no, this. This is the game you've been waiting for right here.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
This is the good stuff.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Awesome.

43:53.000 --> 44:00.000
Mean it. That's all I say. And mean it. Because you only got so many chances left before people just, you know, aren't buying this anymore.

44:00.000 --> 44:07.000
But then again, I don't know. You could make 20 crappy Sonic games and if one comes out and it's really good, word will get around. People will buy it.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
It's just about time they say, yeah, we fucked up.

44:10.000 --> 44:18.000
I was going to ask you, as a Sonic fangirl, and general Sega fangirl in general, look at your classic games of the week.

44:18.000 --> 44:29.000
The last Sonic game that they did right was the first Sonic Adventure, I thought. And that, and I did like, what was the racing game that they had on PSP? Sonic Rush, wasn't it?

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
I think so.

44:30.000 --> 44:37.000
That one was pretty fun, too. But any of the other 3D offerings that they've given, I really didn't find all that exciting.

44:37.000 --> 44:43.000
And that one that we played at E3 a couple years ago, the control was absolute shit. So, what the hell, right?

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Right.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Startetsuya says, I concur.

44:46.000 --> 44:55.000
They made me cry. They made my soul hurt. They made my soul hurt almost as much as seeing stuff from my childhood used to sell cars.

44:55.000 --> 45:04.000
And here's the comment you always see anytime Sega gets brought up by SSJ100. Matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com. Dear Sega, Shenmue 3.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
I wish they would. Now, I liked the Shenmue series. So, whatever.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Shenmue's one of those things that was hokey when it came out, but it aged like a fine wine.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
It was great. And C-Man.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Let's play Lucky Hit.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
Well, how about something else?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
How about something else?

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
EA. I know people like to groan and everything, but here's something new to groan about.

45:26.000 --> 45:36.000
EA is going to be doing a series of games for PC and DS that is going to be off of the Four Dummies series of books.

45:36.000 --> 45:43.000
You can actually, for now, download Poker for Dummies on PC off the Pogo download area.

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
Well, in theory, you're supposed to be able to. That means if it's up there.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
But there's also going to be Texas Hold'em, Omaha Seven Car Stud.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
And then there's going to be Solitaire for Dummies, Brain Training for Dummies.

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
That's in October. The Solitaire one's in September. Sudoku for Dummies in November.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
And a whole bunch more.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
How about Braid for Dummies? That's what I need.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Well, you know what?

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
I'm serious.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
How about... I want games for smart people.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
I want, like, Mensa Solitaire.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Then you need to go play those, like, cruel games.

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
Like, I Want to Be the Guy or La Mulana or those types of games that are cruel and unusual.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
No, I mean, like, poker and puzzle and stuff games.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
I want games... I want Mensa Solitaire.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
Fair enough, but here's the problem I have with this whole thing.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
Although it's cute that they have the licensing for dummies,

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
look at the games they're putting out. Sudoku, Solitaire, Texas Hold'em.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
I mean, we've got, like, 50,000 versions of those games across all the consoles already.

46:45.000 --> 46:51.000
What's going to make these so special besides the Four Dummies tagline and the little cartoon guy pointing?

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
The fact that people are admitting to it. That's pretty funny.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I guess.

46:57.000 --> 47:03.000
But, you know, that makes me think that the Strong Bad game might actually be sort of a parody in the title of that, too.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
Instead of, you know, For Dummies, you have For Attractive People.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
Game Guru suggests Sonic For Dummies. Frisbee says Dummies For Dummies.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
That would be the last few ones.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
I even... they have For Dummies everything now, so...

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Yeah, I know.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
They have Childbirth For Dummies.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
They have Podcasting For Dummies, a book I was reading last week.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Guess what? We didn't need that book.

47:23.000 --> 47:29.000
Well, we're living examples of the fact that any dummy can podcast. For real.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I thought it took a special kind of dummy.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
It does.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
It takes a special sort of self-depreciating dummy to do it every week.

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
No, it takes a special kind of dummy, or dare I say it, idiot, to do it for over six years.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
And who's coming up on 300?

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
Practically every Sunday straight. I mean, granted, we miss some here and there, but, you know...

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I don't know. I thought we were a little crooked.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
We're all a little bent here at Orange Lounge Radio.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Hey, how about release dates for dummies?

47:56.000 --> 48:04.000
Yes. Well, this week... I hope you like Madden, because that's coming out on everything.

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
Including, God knows why, the original Xbox.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
Because, you know, that's a viable platform these days.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
Anyways, so other things coming out other than Madden.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
I guess this is still kind of Madden-related. You get the Madden PSP bundle coming out this week.

48:22.000 --> 48:31.000
There is also some crappy PC games, Sinking Island, and Dracula III Path of the Dragon.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
What exactly happens in Sinking Island?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Well...

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
The island sinks!

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Oh my God, spoiler alert!

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
And then the ship crashes into an iceberg.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
I'm glad Jack dies. Oh my God.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
I'm glad you asked.

48:45.000 --> 49:03.000
Sinking Island is about Walter Jones, a billionaire who was found dead at the bottom of a huge art deco tower that he had built as a magnificent getaway on a tropical island.

49:03.000 --> 49:19.000
There are ten suspects who all have a motive for Mr. Jones' untimely death, as Inspector Jack Norm, you have three days before the island disappears and sinks into the ocean to find the truth behind this mysterious death and catch the killer.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
I want this game.

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
It sounds like Clue mixed with the island of Dr. Moreau.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
Mixed with Bioshock, because it's a tower in the middle of the ocean.

49:28.000 --> 49:34.000
You know what? Sometimes these little shitty sounding games are real gems, so you know what? I hope you're wrong. I hope this game is amazing.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
And I hope the island does sink and you're on it.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
If that's not amazing enough for you, then maybe the Cheetah Girls Passport to Stardom on the DS would be your type of game.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Best week ever!

49:45.000 --> 49:51.000
Awesome. Well, here's actually a game that might not be so bad. Space Siege is coming out on the PC.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Wait, Space Age?

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Space Siege, like Dungeon Siege.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
I was thinking Space Ace in my book for some reason.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
Hopefully there will not be a movie being made for this.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
Also this week, Imagine Teacher.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
For you to teach your Imagine Babies. I don't know.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Yes, Imagine Teacher.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
Imagine Teacher. I am a teacher, kind of. I teach adults. That's my day job.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
This game you actually have to create lesson plans and stuff like that.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Wow. I'm kind of curious about this game.

50:20.000 --> 50:26.000
Silent Hunter 4, the Gold Edition, is coming out on PC as well.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
Ford Racing Off-Road, also for the PC.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
And... Oh, did I forget to mention?

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Madden the 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
So that's a whole bunch of Madden and a whole bunch of stuff.

50:41.000 --> 50:49.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it on the list, but I think Line Rider 2 is supposed to be coming out this week.

50:49.000 --> 50:55.000
Although, judging that I don't see it on this list anymore, it might have been delayed.

50:55.000 --> 51:00.000
And if you want to check out Madden, but you don't feel like shelling out that kind of money,

51:00.000 --> 51:06.000
you could probably find Madden 05 or Madden 04 for about 2 bucks this week at certain closeout sales.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
Yeah, we've got like 900 copies of Madden 05.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
Nice.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
We'll sell them cheap.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
Can you melt them down in a landfill or something like that?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I've told them to throw them away.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
Well, let's travel over to Japan and Asia in general. Sometimes we cover the Asian release dates as well.

51:23.000 --> 51:28.000
Madden NFL 09 will come out in Asia as well the same day it comes out here in the US.

51:28.000 --> 51:34.000
Meanwhile, Tales of Vesperia, the Japanese version, also makes its way to other Asian regions this week.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Otherwise, in Japan itself, nothing on the Xbox 360 this week.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
How about on the PlayStation 3?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Same story. There's really nothing new.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
You're going to have to wait until the 21st when Vampire Rain comes out for something new.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
Moving on to the Wii.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Nothing there either.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
It's a very slow week in Japan.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
I guess just not a lot of demand.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Do you think they're all importing Madden or what the hell's going on?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
I don't know.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Olympics?

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Well, I guess I could be.

52:02.000 --> 52:09.000
On the PlayStation 2, Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka Para Iro is coming out in regular and limited edition.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
That is one new release you're getting this week.

52:11.000 --> 52:17.000
It's an adventure game that stars cute anime girls and cute anime cutscenes.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Your favorite. It looks like one of the girls is a radio DJ.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
Perhaps she's a podcaster.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Perhaps.

52:24.000 --> 52:35.000
This could be Dark Sakura if she had blonde hair and a disproportionate size boobies and one eye strangely larger than the other.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Sometimes I wish you sat on cam because that was really funny.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Hell no.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
That was really funny.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
I've had blonde hair before.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Really?

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
It sucks.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Really? I'd like to see that.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
You've seen me with blonde bangs.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
I have seen you with blonde bangs.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I did not look good at all.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
Wow. Alright. Fair enough.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
Coming out on the Nintendo DS, a game called...

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I'm sorry. It's not a game. It's an accessory.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
Accessories for your DS to make it look like Stitch from Leo and Stitch or Jack Skellington.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
That looks kind of cool.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
Or Pooh from Winnie the Pooh.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
You can check those out.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Otherwise, on the DS, there's no games coming out this week.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
You can make it look like Pooh.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
That's a really slow week.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
On the PSP, Crazy Taxi Double Punch, which I thought we talked about last week.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
It must have gotten delayed.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
Also, Memories of Sorikata is coming out on the PSP from Cyberfront.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
And it looks to be another game starring Anime Girls.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Ah, yes. I found Line Rider 2.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Delayed to September. Not surprised.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
Nope.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
So, a slow week in Japan as well. Sorry to say.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
How about the UK, Dark Soccer? Same story over there or what?

53:38.000 --> 53:43.000
There's a few things. Not really many, I guess.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
We have Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, Episode 1.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
Homestar Ruiner on PC and Wii.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
Fabled 2 Pub Games on Xbox 360.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Ferrari Challenge on Wii.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
Madden NFL 2009 on Xbox 360 and Wii.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Puzzler Collection on Wii.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
And Table Football on Wii.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Well, that's a Wii-tastic week.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Madden.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
All I've been hearing about that is Madden since my husband has to work the launch.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Plus, and Loki made a good point earlier.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
This isn't a good week to release games with the Olympics going on.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
And that is something that affects the world, in a way.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
Because there are lots and lots of people watching the Olympics.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
I don't even really watch sports, usually, on TV.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
But I'll watch diving.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
You know my calendar? I have the Freakonomics calendar.

54:30.000 --> 54:37.000
It actually stated why they wanted it specifically to be August 8, 2008.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
To have the Olympics open is because 8 is a lucky number in China.

54:41.000 --> 54:47.000
Exactly. Apparently there was a huge amount of couples that got married on 8-8-0-8.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
Because of the significance of the lucky number.

54:50.000 --> 54:55.000
But I just wanted to say, isn't it interesting how there's two sports that everybody seems to tune into?

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
Depending on what your preferences are. There's men's diving, and there's women's volleyball.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
You know what I actually always enjoy watching?

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
I actually like the gymnastics.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Gymnastics is fun to watch.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
For both.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Just for whatever.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
And that and women's swimming.

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
Women's volleyball still got the same outfits they had four years ago?

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
I don't know. Those women are kind of like, you know, female gym teachers anyways.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
And no thanks.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Not really.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
Also, though, I actually have to crack up.

55:24.000 --> 55:31.000
Because I want to see if anyone makes the same mistake that the target shoot guy did last year.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
And to hit the target beyond his target?

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
That's pretty awesome. However, he did not hit his target.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Is Geena Davis going to be doing archery this year? That's what I want to know.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
Because, you know, Thelma is an archer.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Forget it.

55:49.000 --> 55:54.000
I was going to say, my favorite events are the ninjutsu events.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
The what?

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
The ninjutsu events.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
They have ninja events?

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
I like fencing.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
You never see them?

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
No. Shut up.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
He likes curling.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Gaming, nudes.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
Dude, curling is awesome. That's the best part of deca sports.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
Alright, that's the best part of the summer event.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
Shut up.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
Gaming, nudes.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Fable 2.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
They've made the announcement that's coming out October 21st in the US.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
October 24th in Europe.

56:21.000 --> 56:27.000
And, of course, along with that, they are going to be getting the Fable 2 collector's edition.

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
Which includes some, I guess they're like tarot cards.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
A bonus DVD with some behind the scenes stuff.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
Also a little figurine.

56:39.000 --> 56:49.000
And if you pre-order your games now, as Jamie mentioned, the Xbox Live Arcade pub games will be available starting August 13th.

56:49.000 --> 56:56.000
One other cool thing, though, that you get with the limited edition is Master Chief.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
Created in Fable 2.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
As opposed to Master Chef.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Using the character creator.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Interesting.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
I suppose.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
That's pretty cool.

57:07.000 --> 57:14.000
Although, he looked a little weird. I mean, it's kind of like taking a character that looks kind of like him and calling him Master Chief.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
It's weird.

57:15.000 --> 57:22.000
Well, they had something like this that they did during a demonstration at U3 where they created a character like this and I guess they kind of tweaked it a little bit more.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
I don't know. It's neat. He has a lot of belts.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
A lot of belts.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
I don't know.

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
I mean, I'm getting the limited edition because I like crap like that.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I don't know.

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
Alright, I apologize in advance if I'm horribly mispronouncing the name of this thing.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
It's Oni Chambara? Is that what that is?

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
That's correct.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Alright, my Japanese is getting better.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
Just disregard that. You might want to know this game as Bikini Samurai Squad.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
It's still Oni Chambara. That's just a subtitle.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Whatever, but look.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
It's chicks.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Speaking of women's volleyball outfits.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
It's chicks in bikinis wielding swords.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
I mean, hello. Do you need anything more in a video game?

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
The only thing this game is missing is zombies.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Oh, wait. I think they have those too.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
They're battling a zombie horde.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I mean, do games get any better? I think not.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
It's a chick wearing lingerie with a cowboy hat.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
You forgot the cowboy hat.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
Oh, my bad.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
And she has a samurai sword killing zombies.

58:20.000 --> 58:29.000
I already told you this is the greatest game on the face of the earth except for maybe Earth Defense Force which, please God, make another Earth Defense Force game.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Seriously?

58:31.000 --> 58:37.000
This game is the second game I've been waiting to come over here from the Simple series and thank God it's finally here.

58:37.000 --> 58:50.000
It is coming out over here. D3 publisher is going to port the game to the US in hopes that people everywhere will bow down to women with swords in bikinis slashing zombies.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Dark Sakura sound like your kind of game?

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
That sounds like fun.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
I know, it does sound like fun.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
If you don't want it on 360, remember they do have the Wii version coming out as well.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Alright.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Wii!

59:00.000 --> 59:07.000
You know, I almost, I almost brought my Wii today to bring that, to view that game.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Next week though.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
Next week.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Or whenever.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
I must see this game.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
You know, we should just have a special playing that are pre-recording.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
Ooh, that might work.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
Get that game imported or whatever you gotta do. Let's check it out.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Alright.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Already have it, yeah.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
Sweet.

59:22.000 --> 59:31.000
Well, other news, so you know we've been sitting around speculating about why Final Fantasy 13 is going to be coming out on Xbox 360?

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Well, Microsoft has said something.

59:33.000 --> 59:46.000
Actually one of their marketers, Albert Panello, said that it was actually the Xbox 360 sales, like I had speculated before, were what would bring Final Fantasy 13 to the system.

59:46.000 --> 59:52.000
They said that they didn't really make any sort of behind doors deal.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:02.000
They didn't offer a lot of money for them to, for Squeenix to break their exclusivity contract.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I can't speak today.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
That's alright.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I've had a crap week.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
They offered the market share.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That's what they offered them.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Exactly.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Xbox 360 does have the superior market in the United States.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So far they've had more term on it, more sales overall.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And they're actually stating right now that that was the specific reason that Square said, you know what, let's just do it.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Let's put it out on the 360 in the US.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And they also are committed to a simultaneous launch for both of them.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
But their speculation is that that's going to hold up our PS3 release date in the US.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.000
But, depending on how long they've had this going, you know, had this idea forming, they may have already started work on the port.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I could hope so.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
They swear they haven't and they're not going to, but you never know.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I saw the note on there that says they haven't begun work on the 360 version yet.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
But it could be a lie.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
You know what I mean?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
It could be a lie.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
They don't have to tell us the truth.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
It's very true.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
But it likely is the truth.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I mean, why would they lie?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I mean, it could be that they've started, you know, work on one that could just be easily converted to either platform.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Well, my whole thought is they had to explore the fact that it was doable, right?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Well, I don't think that they, what they do when they start programming these games is just, you're not going to have, oh, we are going to do everything on this dev kit.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
No, you're going to start your textures in whatever your 3D program is.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You're going to start working, you know, laying out your scripts and, you know, other programs.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It's not, it's got to come together on a PC or Mac or something, or maybe they do it in Linux.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I don't know.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000
But anyway, whatever way they have to come through it on some sort of computer to get everything together.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And then it's made compatible with the hardware given.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So I think it's not going to be that difficult, especially since we've seen plenty of ports from one system to the other that didn't lose all that much, so.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
All right, let's get some comments from chat.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
JV Mon says, I don't mind Final Fantasy 13 being delayed if it means I get it on the 360.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Keltipo says, Final Fantasy 13 seems so far off at this point, another delay doesn't seem so bad.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
That's kind of how I feel.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I mean, it's like, it's that little spark way off in the distance that, you know, I'm kind of not expecting to see this game before Christmas next year anyway.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So there you have it.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Chat.orangelaundry.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night as we tape on allgames.com.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
As we always do, 6 o'clock Pacific time on Sunday nights, except for next week.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Besides, you have to remember the development cycle starts off with their department for making kickass CG trailers for said game before they even work on the game.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
So, possibly, you might be onto something.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Especially when the final looks nothing like the trailer.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Let's move on.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
We've got the classic game of the week coming up in just a couple more stories in our break.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And then part B. Loki.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Besides, I have one question for you.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
What is better than Final Fantasy 13?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Well, I'll answer that with another question.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Damn straight, that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Game of the year right there.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Will it have Jeff Foxworthy?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Yes, it will have CG Jeff Foxworthy.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
He looks like a zombie, by the way. I don't know.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Can a fifth grader beat Braid? If so, I'm in trouble.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I don't know, maybe.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Is this going to be one of their massively online games that we're teasing at E3, like 1 versus 100?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
No, I'm going to guess this is going to be their crappy port of the Wii game that's coming out.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
But it is being put out by THQ, which I do think they are putting out the crappy game.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And yeah, it should be coming out sometime after all the cool games come out on Xbox Live Arcade this month.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Oh well.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Hey, wait, is Xbox Live Arcade?

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Xbox Live Arcade.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Well, that's kind of interesting, I guess.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So I can embarrass myself and my friends online with what I don't know.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Yeah.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Although usually I seem to watch the show and I seem to do okay on the show.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
But sometimes there's like a world history question that I just don't get.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Because history was never my strong subject.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I don't know, he's just creepy looking, man.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Seriously, it's like, if you get this question wrong, I'm going to jump through the TV and eat your brain.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Look how small his head is!

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
His head's shaped like a cantaloupe.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I'm going to show the chat room what his head looks like, okay?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Look at his head!

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000
DarkTetsuya says, bye, give me the mole on Xbox Live Arcade. Reality games on Xbox Live Arcade, I don't think that could happen, though.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
They're too psychological intensive.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Anyway, speaking of Xbox Live Arcade games, we've been talking a lot, a lot, a lot about Braid tonight.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
A lot of people have been talking about Braid.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000
What's very interesting, though, have you checked out the official walkthrough for Braid?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
The creator, Jonathan Blow, actually put up an official walkthrough for Braid.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
It's available at braid-game.com slash walkthrough.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I'm going to go ahead and give you a spoiler for the walkthrough.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:11.000
The first page tells you how to power up the game, how to get into the actual game itself from the sunset-looking starting screen.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And then you go into page two of the game after you get walked through the first world.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And page two tells you, solve the puzzles yourself and stop using a walkthrough.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
You stupid dork!

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
All the puzzles in Braid are reasonable.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
If you're having problems solving a puzzle, don't give up.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Please do not use a walkthrough. Don't give up. Thank you for your time.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And yet, might I point out the irony that currently this game is sitting at number three on the most requested FAQs on GameFAQs.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Probably from people feeling as dumb as me.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000
However, I will say, though, there are rewards to be got from this game, like any game, from not using a walkthrough.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
That's not going to stop some people that want to know the story, and there is going to come a point where I'm just not going to be able to freaking resist.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
But I do like the little trick played on us by the official developers. I thought it was cute, if nothing else.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And that was something I found, by the way, on Major Nels' Twitter, which you were saying earlier in the show.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I've been thinking that's major use.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And there's some pretty funny stuff that he posts every so often.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
You should also add on the Xbox staff, Trixie's there.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
She posts a lot more random stuff, but she's a good read, too.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
There's a lot of great gaming people on Twitter. That's like the place where everybody's at right now.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I have Twitterrific on my iPhone.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
There's so many other indie game podcasters I'm following on Twitter.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Godfree, Gamer Edie, Bobby, just off the top of my head.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
On top of that, there's other famous individuals on there. Will Wheaton has a Twitter.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
So I've been reading that.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Dude, Obama is following me.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
No, that's how I found his Twitter.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Nice.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And I was like, dude, I'm not even anything on there that says anything about being Democrat.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I'm a Libertarian.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Although I'm voting for him.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Alright. Danger, danger, political discussion, danger.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I can say who I'm voting for.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Alright.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Let's get into other topics, though.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Like your vote for the Classic Game of the Week that all the kids should be playing this week.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Because every week you like to pick a game from the archives.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And this week, as I understand it, we have a nice change of pace.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
It's not Sega-related this week.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Sort of.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I'm just messing with you.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Alright, here it is, folks, your Classic Game of the Week.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
What should the kiddies be dusting off and playing this week?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I think this also wins the About Damn Time award, too.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Because the game that I picked is Tempest 2000.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Nice.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Tempest 2000 is one of the only good games on the Atari Jaguar.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000
It is the only Atari Jaguar game that I have ever used in this segment.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And I'm actually referring to the Sega Saturn version, which is the one that I have.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
So, screw a bunch of the Atari Jaguar.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I have played this on the Jaguar, believe it or not, and I endorse it on the Jaguar.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
It's a good time.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
You just have to play the music.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Let's take a listen to some of the hot techno music in the game.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Remember this?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Oh, hell yeah.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Super Zapper Recharge.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Remember the soundtrack I burned off of this resolution to?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Nice.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Good times.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Anyway, tell us a little more about Tempest 2000.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Well, if anyone's ever played the original Tempest, it was a vector game that was put

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:26.000
out by Atari where you go on a series of different shaped fields.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000
And you can only move left or right for yourself, but you'll have ones that look like a V or

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
some that look like a giant octagon.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Or the first stage is basically a straight plane.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
But this one, other than just shooting the little ships as they approach your ship on

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
this plane, you have other little goodies added.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
You also have spikes that come up.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I think the spikes were in the original, too, that you have to shoot the spikes all the

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
way back down to the bottom.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
They will try to, you know, if the enemy ship gets up to the top of the plane, they can

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
catch you.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Now, what they've added to this one is you get a particle laser so that you can shoot

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
faster and, you know, more energy.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:16.000
You can gain points for, you know, bonus ships and stuff.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
You can get a jump power-up so you can jump over the enemies when they're on the top line.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000
An AI droid, which is just this little vector cube that follows you around and shoots.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
A warp token so you can...

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Wait, wait, wait, we have to listen to this part.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Oh, this version doesn't have the voice, did it?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
No, it says it really quietly.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Super Zapper Recharge is added on the...

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Super Zapper Recharge is the best part.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Well, you know why this has better music and better musical quality than the Jaguar did?

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Because the Saturn has a much, much better sound processor than the Jaguar did.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
In fact, I want to even say that the Saturn sound processor was better than what was on

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
the PlayStation.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Do we get to see the bonus stage in this clip?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Because that part of the game always tripped me out.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I didn't watch that movie.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Oh, that's alright.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
It had the weird ambient music too.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Let me turn it down a little bit because those gunshots are getting a little annoying.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Alright, go ahead.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Sorry.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But you also, as you go through, you can get warp tokens to travel to different stages.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:27.000
You can also get a power-up to destroy all of the enemies that are on the screen and

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
move you to the next level.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
It's called Outta Here.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
You get one that...

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Well, the female voice in there goes, yes, yes, yes, when you get this power-up.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And you get it when you're warping off a completed one.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
So it gives that...

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
So when you start your next level, the first power-up that you get is an AI droid.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And it says yes, yes, yes, but in that, you know, really high-pitched sort of oh baby

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
way.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Eat electric death.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I love that.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
When you use your giant zapper thing, it says eat electric death.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
It just happened in the clip here, eat electric death.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I know, that's so cool.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Caught you.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Guy died.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And when it says catch, it goes whoa.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000
So we've also got other versions, like this particular music that we're playing here is

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
like I said, the Sega Saturn version.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It did first come out on Atari Jaguar.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
There was a PlayStation version that's called Tempest X3.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
It's supposed to be updated graphics and music, but it's...

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Actually, I don't think it's as much fun.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:50.000
However, if you put in all caps Y-I-F-F exclamation point on the high score table, you get to play

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
the original Tempest 2000.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Nice.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
But it doesn't save any of your high scores, so that's kind of sad.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
They also have this on PC, right?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Because I remember playing this on PC.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Yes, there's a PC version, which I've got it somewhere.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
There's also...

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
You can actually get a soundtrack for it.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I mean, although, honestly, with the Saturn version, all you have to do, it's all Redbook

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
audio.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
There's been other games that try to be like Tempest since Tempest 2000.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I don't know.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I apologize.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
You were going to talk about this, but...

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
There was Space Giraffe.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Yes, Space Giraffe on Xbox Live, but the problem with Space Giraffe is that it was kind of

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
funny, like it had its moments that it was really funny, but the problem I had with it

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
is that graphically, the game was ruined.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I mean, how graphics can single-handedly ruin a game.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000
And the same problem I had with Tempest on Xbox Live Arcade, they remade the original

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Tempest, did this whole remake of the original Tempest, it was missing that...

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
There's a Tempest 3000.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
There's that X factor I can't put my finger on that Tempest 2000 had that the Tempest

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
on Xbox Live Arcade most definitely doesn't have.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I do have to tell you one thing, though, that I do really like about the PlayStation version,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Tempest 6.3, is it used the NegCon.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000
The NegCon for the uninitiated is a Namco controller that you...

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
It's separate in the center, so it twists.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
It was made for Wipeout and other racing games.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
All right.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I have four of them, so...

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Nice.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
It took me forever to find them, but I have two Japanese ones and two American ones.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000
But the other thing that I think is interesting is that anyone likes the music in this one,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
it was actually done by Imagine Design, which is now Brilliant Development, and they did

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
the music for Jaguar Games, Alien vs. Predator, and Battlemorph.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And I do recall Alien vs. Predator actually having some pretty sweet music.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
You can also use the Jaguar's rotary controller on this, too, so you can get your sort of

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
old-school stuff.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
So what you do to get that is you pause on controller one and controller two at the same

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000
time on the options menu, and you can choose the rotary controller.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
However, the rotary controller actually never was released.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Nice, nice.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
You know, what do we say about the Jaguar?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
It sucked!

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Well, you know what?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I take that back.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Because there were other... there was another couple of good games, but I think they were

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
also remade original.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Yeah, anything that was on the Jaguar, it was good.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It was probably remade.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000
But at any rate, there have been people who actually went out and made a rotary controller,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
so you can find them online somewhere, and people have modified old 2600 controllers

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
that are doing that, too.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:39.000
But anyway, it was designed by Jeff Minter, and so I say go check out some of his other

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000
contributions, too, even though he did give us Space Giraffe.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
All right.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
So that's it, then?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Tempest 2000, Classic Game of the Week?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I was really just trying to talk a whole lot so you could keep your music playing and

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
you could highlight your music.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Well, the clip's about up, so there you have it.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Your Classic Game of the Week, Tempest 2000.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Favorite thing about the game in a nutshell?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It's awesome.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
There's not a favorite thing.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
It's the entire package.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
It's the whole thing is one.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Fair enough.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I will accept that answer.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
All right.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
That's going to do it for our Classic Game of the Week and for part A here on Orange

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Lounge Radio.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Stay tuned, guys.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
We'll be right back after a quick free break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:25.000
She's calm.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
There are a couple of other things I just tell you and I remember.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
He's crazy.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
If you could not see the similarities and the personalities within the first couple

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
of episodes, you'd need brain surgery.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I mean, seriously.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Can two people get together and record a podcast without driving each other crazy?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Slap.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Oh, you just have to hit me so hard.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
It wasn't that hard.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your host, DJ Ranma S and Kuro Usagi.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Log on to DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000
How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
We should have a rape carnival.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Tell them to rape things because rape is funny.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Walk around the neighborhood and rape cats in your neighborhood.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Hold a plastic knife.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
You have to have a plastic knife.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And take pictures.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Ladies and gentlemen, rape isn't funny.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Unless if it's clown rape.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Rape of people is not funny.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Rape of monsters is funny.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Because monsters are bad.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And when bad people...

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
What?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I'm just not going to keep going.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Let go of the shovel.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Yeah, I'm digging myself a hole.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
The video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000
To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Well, except that asshole.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000
There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
He doesn't even fucking make sense.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Welcome back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
August the 10th of 2008 is the night we are taping live.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Myself, Rob Roberts, joining me as always.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
DarkSakura.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Hi!

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Back for more gaming news after feeling a little...

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I had some pretzels to snack on during the break there.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And some vitamin water to refresh me now.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Even though they say this stuff is really not as good for you as you'd think.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I'm full of energy.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
It's better than soda.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Good!

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Lots of energy.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Lots of energy to get through gaming news?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Yes!

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
How about you, Loki?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Are you energetic?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
No.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I guess not.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Will you mind doing some gaming news for us anyway?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Yeah.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Alright, sure.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
So, it's already been rumored that it's coming out at some point.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But Guitar Hero Metallica was pretty much confirmed by Metallica themselves

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
during an interview with Lars Orch.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And basically, the quote is,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
if somebody's going to follow up Guitar Hero Aerosmith,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
we're talking and it's exciting.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And the people at Guitar Hero and Activision are rapidly becoming our best new friends in the world.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
You can put the rest of it together yourself.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
So, yeah.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Guitar Hero Metallica, once again, horing up the franchise next year.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But there's going to be a lot of people that are going to buy this game, even more so than Aerosmith.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Yeah, probably.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Aerosmith's a pretty rockin' band, don't get me wrong.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
But Metallica's even more so.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Metallica is godly.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Even after the backlash of Napster and all that.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
We kind of forgot about that.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
It's really to enlighten St. Inger.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Am I one of the few people on the planet that actually liked Reload and Load, those albums?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I loved it!

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I thought those albums were pretty good.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
The best part of those albums was the fact that Mary Ann Faithfull was on a song.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It was so rad.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
But nothing ever tops the awesome that was the S&M concert.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Oh, was that the orchestra?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
The one was Cayman.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
And the, um, what was it?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Berkeley, I think?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Yeah, it was local from where they're from.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Yeah, I just thought it was funny that people who bought season passes for theater and opera had to listen to Metallica.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Comments from our chat room.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
chat.orangelandradio.com

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
ActDeaf says,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Lars is a big sellout, according to ActDeaf, so there are still some people that are Metallica hatin'.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
JV Monn says,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
My store still has dozens and dozens of Guitar Hero Aerosmiths still in my store.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
You know, I've noticed the same thing.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Loki, any idea, I don't know if you know anything from the inside, but any idea on how Aerosmith Guitar Hero's been selling?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Um, we sold a lot of it, and then...

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
That's about it.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
No, not a lot of reorders.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So, okay, isn't that bad, though, when there's not a lot of reorders?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Because that means the ones that were bought for the shelves aren't leaving.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Isn't that bad?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Uh, could be.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I mean, I'm not trying to distort the facts or whatever, maybe they are selling really good, but...

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Well, just have a look at the NPD numbers at the end of, uh, for July to see how it did.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Actually, though, it'd probably still be doing pretty well through July.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Maybe the NPD number is in September for August to see how well it's doing.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Hmm. Alright, good.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Because, um, you know, it sold a lot, but, you know, a lot of people were just picking it up for the hell of it, I guess, I don't know.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Uh, JV Monn continues,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
JV Monn continues, Guitar Hero Aerosmith sold really well the first week, then people stopped carrying.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:30.000
I do intend on picking it up, but, again, I'm holding out for a price drop, and if they're not leaving shelves, maybe that'll happen sooner than people were telling me it was gonna.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
The other thing, too, you have to look at is a lot of people may have already had the guitar bundles for it already,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:43.000
so maybe people just bought way too many bundles for their stores, and the game only versions are selling well.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Because, I mean, I could see that, especially if, you know, say you're in the Guitar Hero and you've had one through three already,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000
you probably already own a second guitar, you probably don't need a third guitar, so, maybe.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And Dark Tetsuya says the mandatory, uh, and Skye, how about Guitar Hero Journey?

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Uh, you know I'm down with that. By the way,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Rob's not gonna stop believin'.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Did you hear, I'm not stopping believin', did you hear the Journey is going to be in town?

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
How are they?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
With heart.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
What?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And cheap trick.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
When?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Like, soon.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
We're going, right?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I don't know, it might be the same weekend as PAX, I have to look it up.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I'll find out.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I'll look it up.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I will be angry.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I'll look it up while we read a story.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Dude, if there's one thing better than Journey, it's heart and Journey.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
It's heart.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I don't care, I don't care.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
As long as I get my power ballads, I'm happy.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
SHA100Matt says Guitar Hero Abba.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
No, that's for my dream pop and music game.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
That would be like Keyboard Mania.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Anyhow, sorry, let's move on.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Yeah, shall we?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
The full Rock Revolution setlist was released this week.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
You know, the Konami game we were teasing a little bit in Parday.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Yeah, I know.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Here's the thing, there's only 41 songs on it.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Apparently none of them are originals, at least that's what we've heard.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
A spreadsheet went out earlier this week.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I guess it was actually leaked from the inside.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Now, here's the thing though.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
It does have some kind of cool things on it.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Speaking of heart, Magic Man is in the game.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Which is kind of cool, right?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Okay, that means I have to get this game now.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Damn you!

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Damn you, Konami!

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
It's a cover, it could be bad.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Don't care, she'll go have it.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
But check this out.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Come on, Feel the Noise by Quiet Riot is in it.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Okay, that's cool.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
That's kind of awesome too.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Mega Death is in it.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Which Mega Death?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Holy Wars, The Punishment Due.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Ooh.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Queen with Stone Cold Crazy.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I love that song.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
This is Butt Rock's version.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Kinda, in a way.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
It has Blitzkrieg Bot by the Ramones.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
That's the one they failed to famously on stage at E3.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Am I Evil?

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Bad Reputation by Joan Jett.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And just to top it off for fun,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Sk8er Boi by Avril Lavigne.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
There you go.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
And Linkin Park, so it's not totally Butt Rock.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
All the small things.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
All of the slash wrist people.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000
To go back to the non-gaming related stuff we were talking about just earlier.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Sure.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Journey with Heart and Cheap Trick, you were close.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
It is the 27th of September.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
We're going.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
We can go.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
We're going.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
We are down.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
And it's at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Guess what else is?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
What?

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Mountain View?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
No.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
There's one in Cali.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
There's one in Sac too.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Whatever they call it.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Sleep Train or Sac Valley.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
They change the name of it every year.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
But next month also is Weird Al.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
That's pretty cool.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
At the fair.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I've never seen Weird Al live before.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
You're coming with us.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Maybe we should do OLR live at the Journey concert.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Let's do that.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Oh my god, that would be fantastic.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I don't know if it's possible.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
We'll find a way.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
We'll go record in the bathroom.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Concord Pavilion, the 24th.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I know they're coming to Sleep Train Amphitheater.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Look it up.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Look it up at the Sac Valley thing.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I'll look it up later.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
So, can I do my story?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Yes, Jamie, just do your story and I will look up Journey and Heart.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000
So, they're not as, you know, didn't go through their massive 80s-tastic mode because Ozzy

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
always rocks.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:06.000
But there is going to be Ozzy in Guitar Hero World Tour.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
We actually have some tracks released today.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000
And the two Ozzy songs are going to be Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Other tracks announced is Airborne, Too Much, Too Young, At the Drive-In, One-Armed Sister,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Scissor, sorry, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Weapon of Choice, Bob Seger, Hollywood Nights,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Dinosaur Jr., Philipine, I love Dinosaur Jr., I'm sorry.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000
We also have Silver Sun Pickups, Lazy Eye, System of the Down, BYOB, Survivor, Eye of

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
the Tiger, Rob, Eye of the Tiger.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Sorry, I'm sitting here, it's September 26th.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
We're going.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Friday.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Friday night.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
We're going.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
We're going, we're there.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
That's the one in Wheatland, right?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Yeah.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.000
It's called Stillborn and other tracks that were previously announced, just to repeat

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
those for the listeners, Billy Idol, Rebel Yell, which I'm like, hell yeah.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.040
Blink 182, Dammit, Foo Fighters Everlong, which, you know, that's going to make Drew

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.700
all pee himself or something.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.040
It makes me all pee myself.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.040
I love that song.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040
Foo Fighters are pretty awesome.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.040
So Jimmy Hendrix songs.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.040
That makes me happy.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.760
Purple Haze, the live version, Wind Cries Mary, Linkin Park, What Have I Done, Paramore

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.240
Misery Business, Sublime Santeria, I'm going to yawn so bad for that one.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.240
I'm so over sublime.

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.240
Yeah.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.240
It's really old blade.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.800
The Doors, Love Me Two Times.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:27.800
That's a good one.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:32.720
The Eagles Hotel, California, and Van Halen, Hot for Teacher.

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:33.720
I'm sorry.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.920
I'm not the biggest fan of the David Lee Roth era, but I love Hot for Teacher.

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.360
That was a good, that was a fun one.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.280
I love When I Kissed the Teacher by Abba.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.280
Nevermind.

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:49.120
You know, I've got, I've got a present for you from Ronma at my house.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.120
What's that?

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.120
I have an Abba album.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120
Awesome.

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.120
Album.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.120
Like old art and everything.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.120
Yeah.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.080
Maybe we can put that in the blank space on Justin TV.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.760
And he got you a Bette Midler album.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.840
I'm not as big on Bette Midler, but my mother is, so I'll go take that to her.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.160
He got you Super Trooper.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.160
Oh, awesome.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160
Anyway.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.160
Sorry.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.160
Yeah.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.160
Orange Lounge, Abba-oh.

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.240
It's Abba Lounge Radio.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.120
Loki save the show, please.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:19.280
Since we were talking about Rock Band earlier, and I mentioned that we were going to be talking

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280
about street dates.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:26.280
Well, the street dates apparently were leaked out of some database somewhere.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:29.120
The dates that they have- It wasn't you, was it?

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.120
It wasn't me.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.120
God.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.120
I don't do that sort of thing.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.120
Anymore.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.120
Shh.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.120
Quiet you.

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.120
And he doesn't do it any less.

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.120
Ahaha.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:46.480
So, according to this database, which I think- I want to say that it was Fred Meyer or something

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480
like that.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:50.360
Maybe it was Blockbuster.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.560
Probably Blockbuster.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:59.720
The 360 version they have coming out September 24th, the PS3 October 19th, and the Wii November

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:03.480
18th.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.520
That is about half true.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:10.960
Oh, really?

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.040
That's not entirely correct.

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:18.600
Is there a certain element of that that might be incorrect?

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.220
The dates for those systems are correct.

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.000
They just don't mention one thing.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.760
In September, the game only version for Xbox 360 is coming out, and the accessories are

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.720
coming out by themselves.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:36.360
The bundle's not coming out until the PS3 date, which is the same time the PS3 will

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.920
be getting the standalone and the bundle.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:39.920
That actually makes sense.

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.120
Because they're rushing the game out.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:49.360
And then the Wii version is coming out November 18th along with the PlayStation 2 version.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.360
And now you know.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.120
They were close, but you know.

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.120
Not close enough.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.260
They're probably getting the game only version.

01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.080
What about the achievements and trophies in the game?

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.740
Well, the achievements and trophies are going to be very similar to the last game.

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:13.040
They have trophies for playing 100% on a song on expert for guitars, drums, vocals, bass.

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.700
Also for doing a Flawless Guitar Solo.

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:21.200
They also have some for the band World Tour Mode, including one for reaching one million

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.880
fans.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:31.920
They have some stuff for the actual drum trainer, including completing some different beats

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:35.100
and stuff like that.

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:38.480
And then of course they have some drum challenge achievements and stuff like that.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.400
It looks very similar to the first game.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.480
Hopefully now that Band Tour is supposed to be online playable, so I can play it with

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.720
friends of mine and not have to have everybody over, I'll actually be able to unlock some

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:48.720
of those achievements.

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:49.720
Yeah.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.680
Because I don't have the full thing, so I've never got those achievements.

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.720
I'm counting on my friend who plays Rock Band a lot more than I do to play my copy and get

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:56.720
me the achievements.

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:57.720
I'll play it with you.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.040
You should come over one day and we'll get all those achievements.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.140
I need to get that kit.

01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.640
I need to get that kick-ass drum set.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.280
You just have to learn how to drum.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.280
Exactly.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.280
All right.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.000
Well, onto a completely different note.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.520
This has nothing to do with music games whatsoever, although you might say these two are making

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.240
music together.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.240
This is from a post on these forums, MMORPG.com.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:23.520
They're talking about the game Age of Conan and this user, I don't know if the user themselves

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:24.520
did it.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.240
I don't think they did, but they're posting screenshots from the Age of Conan game where

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:34.120
apparently one of these players who plays a male character in the game had cybersex

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:35.240
with the GM.

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.760
There's no real way to say this.

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:41.680
And I was going to have Loki and I do the banter here back and forth, but somehow I

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.480
don't think I'm going to be able to get him to do it.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.520
So let me just give you some of the quotes.

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.520
What?

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.520
Admit it.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.520
It would be funny.

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.680
We could pretend we're having the chat and read the quotes.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.680
Yeah.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.200
I don't think we'll give the fanboys that kind of fodder.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.560
Unfortunately, if we did that, who knows what PSA we would receive next week.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.560
Well, okay.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.480
They posted these screenshots here and apparently they were, they were cybering a little bit

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:09.560
with the GM and look, here's some of the quotes from here.

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:13.960
The player with dual wheeled barbarians though, I mean two, that's a bit difficult for me

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.960
to handle.

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:20.200
I'd rather stick with one big sword and the GM says, you like it rough, I take it.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.160
The player says, be gentle.

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:27.800
The GM says, are you a real woman, lol, not crazy question, you would be surprised.

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.080
And the player says, yep, I just play a male character so guys don't flirt with me in game

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.720
like on wow.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:37.680
And the GM says, I'm wearing panties, joke.

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.880
Then they get summoned to a special area where, look at this, there's a screenshot of the

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.880
GM that's completely naked.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:47.000
Well, I mean, as naked as you can get in an MMO, only wearing undies and nothing else

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
there.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.640
And the player's just kind of sitting down chilling or what have you.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.160
And they're going on here.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.720
The player says, whip out your massive sword.

01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:01.520
And the GM says, rofl, lol, you like, and so on and so on.

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.840
Where does it get really bad here, towards the end it gets really bad.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:10.000
The GM ends up saying, hmm, you are bad, what if I rip your panties off and fuck you hard

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.680
until I'm satisfied.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:18.640
Wanna feel you get really, wait, this is of course cyber chat, so the grammar's all horrible.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:23.600
Want to feel you get really wee so I can put it just ahead of my you know what, inside

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.440
you, and use my hand to slowly move it around before plunging it fully into you and making

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.000
you take it all.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Wow.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.720
I mean, that's a GM in the game.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:37.800
As you can probably imagine, this guy got canned, but here's the part that's kind of

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.680
irritating.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.560
So the whole thing was a big joke.

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:46.120
The player then suddenly yells, this is Sparta.

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:49.360
You're so kinky, you just cybered with a dude.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:55.280
And then the GM says, lol, why did you want this then, are you gay, are you serious, and

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:57.760
then the player says, serious about what?

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:01.680
I was joking about the fapping, but then I am indeed the dude.

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:05.560
And the GM says, lol, okay, glad I put my clothes back on.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:10.600
And then the player says, yeah, probably a good idea, I have AIDS.

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:18.040
Like, you had me going here like at the lolsy factor, but then like this is the equivalent

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:21.360
of me getting up on stage and telling this like hilarious joke.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:25.120
Like imagine I'm Ellen DeGeneres and I come out on stage and I'm really funny and everybody's

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:29.640
laughing and I'm making jokes at people's expenses and then at the very end of my show

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:33.680
I take my pants off and I poop live on stage.

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:38.280
Like that's kind of what happened here is that, you know, lol, you had to end it with

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:41.200
the haha gay AIDS joke.

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:47.080
Like you suck and it's not funny and, you know, this poor guy probably got fired over

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:51.500
what you did and posting all these things on the internet and if you wanted to be funny

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.560
that wasn't the way to go about doing it.

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:58.600
So you can suck it and you make me very angry and therefore we're going to do the FUs of

01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.600
the week.

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.600
Oh, I'm sorry, do you have a comment, Dark Saga?

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:02.600
I did have a comment.

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:03.600
Oh, go ahead, sorry.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:09.400
First of all though, that's a big pile of mutual stupidity so I don't feel sorry for

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.400
either of them.

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.920
The GM's no dumber than you are, my friend.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:17.600
Not you, I know I'm looking at you but I mean the user.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:22.880
The user first of all is an asshole and also pretty much dumb fuck for the little comment

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:28.760
at the end but the GM should have been a GM in the first place if, you know, they were

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:34.920
going to basically act inappropriately especially, and now if it's like a private server that's

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:41.440
one thing but if this is a public server where someone is technically as an employee for

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:46.280
said company, they are a representative of the company, they should know better.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.280
Exactly.

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:51.720
Amaze Satsuma in chat says pooping on stage is still better than Carrot Top.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:52.720
Yeah.

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:57.560
Look, you get my analogy, all right, even if you have to be a smart ass about it.

01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:02.120
All right, now I'm still angsty, I still have enough residual angst, hopefully Dark

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:15.560
Saga does two to the FUs of the week.

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:20.880
My FU of the week goes towards a hormone, that's it.

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:21.880
Damn those hormones.

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.880
Loki.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:28.120
All right, FU of the week goes to my high school reunion, the 10 year high school reunion.

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.520
What a complete fucking waste of time and money.

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:37.440
Just a note for all you people maybe still in high school and thinking, hey, you know,

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:40.200
10 years from now I can go see all my friends again.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.400
Don't do it, seriously, I mean about 30 or 40 people show up and they're probably the

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.440
people that you weren't friends with anyways, just keep in touch with your friends.

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:54.560
Me and myself, I don't really have a whole lot of FUs of the week, I had a fairly decent

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.560
week.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.560
Raph, if I kick you will you have an FU?

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:01.560
Yes I will, I will have an FU, FU to the ferret, it stinks.

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:08.600
No I know I had a bad, I FU to drama, believe it or not, because there has been drama recently

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.400
and it's no fun at all.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.800
Drama's poopy.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.040
Drama is poopy, drama is no fun.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.560
Save the drama for your llama.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.560
A gun is no fun.

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.560
Yes they are.

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.600
I have a character on WoW called Drama Llama.

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.800
Guns are lots of fun.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.920
Unless, you know, guns are fun unless you're shooting people with guns, then they're not

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:25.920
fun.

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.920
Do you know?

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:31.040
But shooting cats with guns is hilarious, no I'm kidding, don't do that, it's not funny.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.520
I believe in everyone should have a gun.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.080
I'm serious.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:39.280
I'm completely in the opposite, here we go in the political stuff again, because I don't

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.280
agree with you here.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.640
I'm gonna say one thing about that, just to see what you think.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.320
Promise me we can get back to gaming after that, alright.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:50.440
Do you think that most people are good?

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.440
Most people.

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:57.720
If everybody had a gun, a concealed weapon, whether they carried it or not, do you think

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.560
that someone would be more likely to do a violent crime on someone who may or may not

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.240
be armed?

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.320
I don't want the responsibility that comes with a gun.

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.120
You don't have to have it, but a lot of people have it.

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:10.040
I don't trust the 1% of people who shouldn't have guns.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:13.840
But do you think that 1% of the population is gonna be stupid enough to attack the rest

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.440
of the population who might be armed?

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.440
I don't know.

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:17.440
I don't know.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.840
That's all I ever have to tell anyone to think about it.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:19.840
It shouldn't have to come to that.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:20.840
Alright.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840
I'm thinking.

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:22.840
Ow.

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:25.480
Oh, don't hurt yourself.

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.840
There's other people to hurt you for you.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:37.960
Anyway, well you know one of my favorite games ever is a Hudson game called Star Prodia,

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:38.960
right?

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.600
And I hate that they're putting it out, they're naming it Prodior, because I'm just used to

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.600
it being Star Prodia.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.960
But it's coming out on Virtual Console.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:53.320
Hudson says it's going to be on the, I do believe, this Monday's release.

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.360
So that's pretty cool.

01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:56.920
That is if they're true to their word.

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:02.080
Well, we didn't get East Book 1 and 2 when it was supposed to be out.

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.440
But Star Prodia and Break In are going to be on Virtual Console.

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:09.000
And I know I've mentioned this plenty of times before.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.080
Star Prodia is a parody of Star Soldier.

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:20.680
And it's a game where you, basically, you can play as the Twinbee, or you can play as

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:26.320
Bomberman, or you can play as a flying PC Engine and shoot things with HuCards and CDs.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.000
That is awesome.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.160
Guns that shoot HuCards I approve of.

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.160
Hell yeah.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.160
Okay.

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.160
But I'm done.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.160
Cool.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.840
Well, hopefully those games actually come out.

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:40.080
Because I've never played this Star Prodia game, and I always hear Dark Soccer rave about

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.080
it.

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.240
So I'm kind of curious to check it out someday.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:45.240
Yeah.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:48.720
Well, there's some other interesting things coming out.

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:54.160
These aren't exactly legitimate releases, but still something that's being worked on.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:58.400
I think we talked about this a while back, but it was under a different name.

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:04.260
I believe last time it was Super Mario Brothers Fusion, which was a game that's fusing kind

01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:11.280
of Super Mario Brothers with Halo, Metroid, Mega Man, in fact they had recreated Aquaman's

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.280
stage and stuff like that.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:16.400
Well, now this whole thing has snowballed into one giant game, including a bunch of

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:21.240
other characters, and it's now called Mushroom Kingdom Fusion.

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:23.940
And it's got 12 playable characters now.

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:30.320
You can actually play as Arthur from Ghouls and Ghosts, you can play as Sonic, Tails,

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:36.560
Luigi, Wario, Kirby, Zelda, or I should say Link, Samus, etc.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.560
Tingle?

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:39.040
No Tingle.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.040
Fail.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.520
But they have all sorts of game references in this, a bunch of different custom levels,

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.600
it's all fan-made, a bunch of different power-ups.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.160
It's Fangasm the game.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.160
It pretty much.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:57.480
You can actually download the beta of this, which I still get to run on my PC because

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:04.480
it's very un, I don't know, they just haven't finished yet.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.400
It's still in beta, it's not optimized yet.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.480
Yeah, not optimized one bit.

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.520
But if you do get to run though, it is pretty awesome, they do have a beta you can check

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:17.520
out that includes a lot of the game that's already done right now.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:23.440
Some of the more recent stuff they did, they have power-ups you can get, including, for

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:27.640
example, if you get the Mega Man power-up, if you're playing Mario, Mario becomes Mega

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:35.920
Mario, Luigi becomes Proto Luigi, Sonic becomes Quick Man, and Tails becomes Gyro Man Tails,

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:36.920
which is interesting.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:40.240
Interesting is a good word for it.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:43.880
And they have actually a website dedicated to it, a whole little wiki and stuff, including

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.720
all the games that they reference in it and have different levels.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:51.220
There's some obscure shit in this, I mean, it's really cool though, and definitely worth

01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:52.220
checking out.

01:39:52.220 --> 01:40:01.680
If you want to check out the game, check out any information on it, the website is mkfusion.ipbfree.com.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:02.680
Ipfreely.com?

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:03.680
What?

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.680
I.P.B.

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:05.680
I.P.B.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:06.680
I.P.B.

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.680
Free.

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.680
I.P.B.

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:09.680
Free.

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:10.680
So.

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:11.680
Alright.

01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:12.680
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.720
Huh, I'll have to check this game out when they fix some of their memory problems.

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.640
It sounds interesting, but it sounds like what would happen if the fans made Super Smash

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:22.640
Brothers, that's what would happen.

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:26.560
Hey, talk about legitimate games though, this one's legitimate and something the fanboys

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.560
definitely want.

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.680
Raiden 4 is going to be coming out for the Xbox 360.

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.360
That has been announced by Moss, who is the developer of Raiden 4.

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.400
They are porting the old arcade shoot-em-up to the Xbox 360, and apparently they're actually

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.960
going to put new aircrafts in the game through download content.

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.440
The game comes out September 11th in Japan.

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:49.480
The game soundtrack is supposed to be included with the game as well, so that's pretty cool.

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:50.480
Raiden 4.

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.480
You a Raiden 4 fan, DarkSakura?

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.480
I know you like your shoot-em-ups.

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:57.800
Actually, I was just having a discussion with Dan about Raiden Fighters, so yeah, I'm pretty

01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:58.800
cool about that.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:40:59.800
Awesome.

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:02.840
Alright, well we're really cool whenever we get emails from you guys.

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:06.320
You make us feel special when you email us at Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:09.680
Sadly, we feel kind of sucky this week, because not a lot of you guys emailed us, and we're

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:14.380
not feeling the love, and I'm going to go cry now, but DarkSakura will read those few

01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:20.320
emails we did get this week, right now.

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:29.800
First email is from GS68, Hey OLR Crew, about the issue of Wii storage space, I'm not sure

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:34.400
if this has been brought up yet, but can't you put VC games on an SD card and then put

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.120
them back on your Wii when you want to play them again?

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.880
Is there something wrong with that?

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.160
Not saying you're dumbasses or anything, just wondering why you can't transfer your VC games

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.800
onto an SD card, does that take too long or is it too inconvenient?

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:50.360
PS, this email was brought to you by Justin TV, home of the never-ending spammers and

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.360
assholes.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:56.080
Yes, on the it's too inconvenient part, it's a little silly that your Wii can read from

01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:00.720
it, but yet it can't read data from it, and access ga- it's like not being able to run

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.800
a pi- imagine this, every time you wanted to look at pictures on a USB card, you had

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:08.440
to copy them to your computer to view them, you couldn't view them right off your USB

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:11.360
card, that's kind of annoying, you know what I mean?

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.000
That's kind of the analogy there, like it's just a little silly that the games won't run

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
off it.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.040
I'll be honest, I didn't realize that you could save them on an SD card, I would actually

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:25.280
back them up that way myself, but the reason being is I would take the ones that after

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.820
I had played them for a while, those I would be- I would back up and set those aside, so

01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:35.800
that if I wanted to play them, you know, later on, like you know like for example if I was

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:40.080
playing like a lot of Alien Crush, I wouldn't move Alien Crush off there, but if say I played

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:45.440
through you know, what's another one on there, Blaster Master, and was kind of tired of it?

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:46.720
Not yet, but someday.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:52.040
I'm just picking, I think, arbitrary title, you know, so that would be the case that I

01:42:52.040 --> 01:43:00.920
think that that could be okay, but if it's- if you're- but not in a- I just want to, you

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:04.160
know, do this every time with every game.

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:07.880
AlphaCananagram has a good point, he says, it just takes too long to copy back on the

01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:10.040
Wii, especially Nintendo 64 games.

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:11.040
Oh, that's a good point.

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.040
Mm-hmm.

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:18.320
God, I wonder how- how those, um, uh, TurboGrafx CD games would be.

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.600
Don't know, don't know.

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:23.120
It's just a little silly, it's not supported yet, I don't know if the slot access is too

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:26.800
slow, but it's just- it's- it's the principle.

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.840
That's all.

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:31.240
Next email, this is from Saltek.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:36.080
Hey, OLR, I just wanted to point out one thing the R4 has done for Nintendo.

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:40.360
Out of the five people I know who own DS's for them bought it only because of the R4,

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:41.360
myself included.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:47.160
Nintendo is going to make money because the R4, um, because the R4 since they make money

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:52.880
on every DS sold, where it is really bad for the third party developers because people

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:56.840
will not be purchasing those games, which is unfortunate, but happens when devices like

01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.520
this are released.

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:02.200
Keep up the great work and I apologize if my grammar sucks, but I'm very bad at writing,

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.200
Saltek.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.560
That's okay, I forgive you.

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:05.660
This time.

01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:07.580
To be honest, I think you're kind of in the minority though.

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:10.620
You and your friends are probably kind of a group of hackers, you know, in the sense

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:15.400
that you enjoy these types of things, you know, in the systems, that's part- you know,

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:20.520
you probably also bought a PSP so you could play NES games on it, I could be wrong, but

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:26.400
do realize you and your friends are not the mass gamer, if that makes sense.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.520
But I don't- I'm not saying I disagree with you, I'm just saying, you know, you can't

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.920
say that four out of all five gamers only bought a DS for the R4, that's the thing.

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.920
That's the one point I'm trying to make.

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:37.960
But, you know, I don't think the R4 is a bad device when used appropriately.

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:40.600
I am all for breaking region locks.

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.120
I am all for that.

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:47.240
Well, the next and last email I should say, well, you know, I'm actually going to be kind

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.560
and check and see if there's one more email because I am kind.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:59.200
And actually, we did get one, dun dun dun, but I'll read that next.

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:05.400
OLR, I was checking to see if OLR has any events or special guests for the 300th show

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:09.720
and if there's any room in the studio slash garage I would like to attend pending travel

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.680
arrangements slash work.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:15.400
Here is some of the reasons which can earn me a spot in the studio as an attendee slash

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.400
guest.

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.360
This person's very fond of slashes.

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:23.280
Having met Dark Sakura, must meet Sky and Loki to complete meeting the trifecta of OLR

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.280
hosts.

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.680
Gave DMN a ride home 35 miles from the arcade, somehow triggering the random chain of events

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:35.480
which would include Dark Sakura paying for one of my games of DDR the following month.

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.960
I play DDR.

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:41.520
I am possibly, probably one of the oldest skilled DDR players, I've just turned 31 and

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:44.760
I can keep up with people nearly half my age.

01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:48.440
This one, great seeing close pick on my summer love is an indication I might have to see

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.640
OLR live in order to AAA that song.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:55.880
I have DDR player as my license plate on my car.

01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.480
I must pay tribute to the fairy.

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:05.400
Those are just a few reasons to be there during the 300th show in some form or another, lol.

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.960
This email was brought to you by Olive Garden, home of the never ending Olive Garden insert

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:13.720
contextual question mark pound 78 dot track dot google dot com.

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:15.560
Peace out and AAA Jammer J.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:20.000
I'm going to be honest, I haven't even thought about the 300th episode yet, it's still two

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.320
months off.

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.120
There's PAX kind of in the way.

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:25.560
It's going to be a little while.

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.960
Yeah I saw the pictures.

01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:32.840
You my friend are a DDR fan if I ever see one.

01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:34.120
I don't know.

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:35.120
It's a big question mark right now.

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.120
We'll see.

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:37.120
More to come.

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:38.120
What do you guys want us to do for our 300th episode?

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:40.460
Wow what a nice perfect attack on my summer love.

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:42.520
What do you guys want to see us do for our 300th episode?

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:43.520
I don't know.

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.360
I want pizza and beer and ice cream.

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.360
We'll see.

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:50.080
I want to go back real quick because I'm an idiot and I got called out on it in chat.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:53.360
Game Guru says the DS has no region lock and duh I should know that.

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.920
I've seen the import games for sale right on the store shelves next to the American

01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:57.920
games.

01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.400
What the hell I was smoking.

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.020
I'll be honest I don't use the DS a lot for region locks.

01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:06.400
It's more for the Playstation games where I'd like to get around it.

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:10.640
But I'm thinking duh I've played Owen Don on my DS I should know better.

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.120
But anyhow.

01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.680
I have Owen Don on my DS I bought puppies from him.

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:22.660
So sorry anyway as far as the 300th episode to be to be determined don't know.

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:25.920
We're always welcoming of other people in the studio but you know just try to give us

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.240
a little advance warning.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.960
Plus I would honestly you really want to come out here just for the show.

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:35.360
I mean if you're going to go to San Francisco and do some tourism around there cool but

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:38.120
it's not even worth it to fly out here just for our little thing.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.400
You can call in on Skype.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:46.040
I mean I'm not trying to you know just being honest we're not that exciting people.

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.040
We're simple people.

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:50.400
We're like Amish people right Dark Soccer with video games.

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.960
Are we are we video game-ish?

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.040
Video game Amish?

01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:57.040
Video game Amish?

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.040
One more email.

01:47:58.040 --> 01:47:59.040
There is something.

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.040
Someone snuck in.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.040
Comments from chat.

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:05.360
Act Def says episode 300 should be on Mexico tequila tacos and more JV Mons and he is from

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.680
Mexico so we can he can try to lobby us to get there just like JV Mons doing episode

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:12.760
300 should be in New York City.

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:15.280
Frisbee says episode 300 should be in space.

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.120
Look I said things we can realistically do.

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.360
I think OLR in space is not going to happen.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.080
Like the ring of that.

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.080
Nice.

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.080
OLR in space.

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.800
All right one more email.

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:34.880
Okay last one says hi folks since I just got an Xbox 360 Elite on August 2nd I have some

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:38.780
questions for you mainly directed at Rob since I know he has a 360 but Loki and Dark Soccer

01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:40.320
can feel free to chime in too.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.320
Oh well thank you so much for your permission.

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:47.480
I know it's nice that the listeners give you permission.

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.680
One for those in my situation where we both have the PS3 and a 360 is it worth getting

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:57.040
the same multi platform games over again if we already have the given game on one of the

01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:58.040
consoles.

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:01.760
For example Call of Duty 4, Rock Band, etc.

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:02.760
Nah.

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:03.760
No.

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:08.440
If you must sell your other one back at least get some credit for it before you buy the

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.840
other one if you feel you must.

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:14.720
This is how some games try to milk money out of you though is by trying to entice you to

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:18.400
buy it again like Soul Calibur 4 the whole Vader Yoda thing.

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.400
Hello.

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:24.920
Although I liked your theory about buying that other game to get both unlocked.

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:28.040
It's very likely.

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.520
My simple answer is no.

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:31.720
I'll ask him.

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.960
Rarely is that type of thing worth it.

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:34.960
I can't think of a lot.

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.000
I mean sometimes the game might really have a lot extra when it comes out on the other

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.600
console like it sounds like Bioshock might have but even then I would want to sell my

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.800
Bioshock on 360 back if I'm going to get it on PlayStation 3 which is actually not something

01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:50.200
I would do in the real world but you know at least do that.

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:53.280
Well moving right along to the next question.

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:58.040
If you could come up with a top 5 list of games for a 360 owner should have what games

01:49:58.040 --> 01:49:59.040
would those be?

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:03.080
If you like you can have separate lists for disc based games, Xbox Live, arcade games.

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.680
I'm going to go ahead and tell you a few that I have.

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:09.320
First of all get Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.600
I love the hell out of that game.

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.480
And the second one's coming out too.

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.680
So it's lots of fun.

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:18.960
Dead Rising you can you know kill zombies with a lawn mower.

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:22.400
That's fun for five seconds.

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:25.400
Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:26.400
Uno.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:34.840
God what else was it that we were playing?

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:35.840
My brain blanked.

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:36.840
That's right.

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:37.840
I'll jump in.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.520
The Xbox Live Arcade as far as that goes.

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.200
I've played almost everything on there.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:46.200
I would say Braid, Geometry Wars 2 which I know just both came out but they're both excellent

01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.200
games.

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:53.800
Rez, Symphony of the Night if you don't already have access to it on PlayStation.

01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:59.200
If you do go Luminous if you've never played it before and you haven't gotten it on any

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.320
other console like the PSP.

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:07.000
And yeah I would say something like Uno or go try something a little different like Catan

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.600
or Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride.

01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:11.400
Try one of those games on for size.

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.680
But don't get Yaris.

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:16.160
Yeah don't get don't be enticed by it's free.

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.760
Same with Totem Ball.

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:22.840
Any contribution Loki?

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:27.640
I'm sorry I'm being distracted by people saying that I need to be in a Tingle suit for the

01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:28.640
300th show.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:29.640
Silly chat room.

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:30.640
That ain't happening.

01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:34.800
Recommend five Xbox 360 games our new listener should pick up.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:35.800
Or Xbox Live Arcade.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:36.800
When are they picking up their 360?

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:37.800
They already did.

01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:38.800
They already have it.

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:39.800
Okay.

01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:40.800
Um.

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:41.800
Let's see.

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:46.320
I would do Earth Defense Force 2017.

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:49.760
Hey it's dirt cheap now seriously.

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:51.800
It's like five bucks or something.

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:52.800
Alright.

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.800
Alright.

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:54.800
Um.

01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:55.800
Crackdown if you want.

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.320
I mean cause that's dirt cheap right now too.

01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:58.800
The jumping game.

01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.800
Um.

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.880
I would say the original Saints Row if you want.

01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.600
I mean if you.

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.640
I guess that's also dirt cheap.

01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:10.760
I agree with JVMon who's flooding Lost Odyssey if you're remotely interested in RPGs.

01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:11.760
I guess.

01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:14.520
There's a lot of RPGs coming out though pretty soon so.

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:15.520
Uh.

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:18.720
Lost Odyssey I guess.

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:20.400
Um.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.980
Bioshock's good.

01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:24.980
And probably.

01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:27.460
OMG Halo 3.

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:30.460
Let's move on.

01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:31.840
I would not recommend Halo 3.

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:32.840
Call D4.

01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:33.840
Alright.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:35.840
Is that.

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:36.840
No.

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:37.840
Alright.

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:38.840
More.

01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:39.840
More.

01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:40.840
Rob.

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:41.840
Anyway.

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.840
Moving forward.

01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:45.320
Have you had any issues with any other players in Xbox Live?

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.960
People essentially being annoying or all around a-holes.

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:47.960
When don't I?

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.960
If so what's the best way to deal with that issue?

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:50.960
Don't play with strangers.

01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:51.960
Ignore them.

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:52.960
Don't play with strangers.

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:56.880
Build up a friends list of good people and I urge you to start on orangeonshreddy.com

01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:01.720
slash forums and if that's not enough for you go visit other forums that you like and

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.600
get other Xbox Live gamer tags and don't play with strangers play with friends.

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:07.340
That's the only way you're going to avoid idiocy.

01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:11.320
Or make sure that you can play in a game where you make sure you start the game and you can

01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:12.560
boot the players.

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.560
That's another good tip.

01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:14.560
If you want to meet people.

01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:16.680
That's actually a very good tip.

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:19.520
Also play games that idiots don't understand.

01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:22.200
That's one reason I recommend Catan and Carcassonne.

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:23.200
Play games that idiots don't understand.

01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:26.000
To laugh at the idiots instead of being offended by them.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.880
We did that one time when we played a bunch of people in the UK at Grand Theft Auto IV

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:33.800
and we kicked the crap out of them and they were like spouting all these obscenities and

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:34.800
it was funny.

01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:35.800
We were just like ahhh.

01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:36.800
They're angry.

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.440
They're swearing with an accent.

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:39.440
Hahaha.

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:40.440
Exactly.

01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:42.000
They're using words like you know.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Oh god.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.720
I just have to say chat room remind at orange box.

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:47.720
None of us said orange box.

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.720
And we really should have.

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:49.720
Yeah.

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:50.720
You need portal.

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:51.720
Alright sorry go ahead.

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:56.640
But I was also going to say it just goes back to what was it I was saying a few weeks ago.

01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:59.280
Learn to be offended.

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:00.280
I agree to an extent.

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:01.280
They're stupid.

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:02.280
There's so much idiocy on Xbox Live though.

01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:03.360
There's so so much.

01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:04.360
You get.

01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.360
It gets old.

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.360
It's funny the first few times.

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.780
It gets so old.

01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:11.320
I report every single one because I'm that guy.

01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:12.320
No.

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:13.640
Last question on here.

01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:14.640
Uh huh.

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:18.060
If you don't mind would you please send me a friends list to invite on Xbox Live.

01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:21.760
My gamer tag is spazinator on PSN.

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.360
Minus the quotes obviously.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.360
Okay.

01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:26.560
What about Xbox Live?

01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.040
This is the Xbox Live one.

01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:29.040
Oh okay spazinator.

01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:30.040
There you go.

01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:31.040
Spazinator on PSN.

01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:35.280
Um sadly my friends list is full and I probably won't ever remember but if you send me a message

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:39.000
asking nicely I'll boot somebody who hasn't been on in like 90 days.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:45.720
I think mine is DarkSakuraLLR but I never use it because my husband we use his and he

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:51.640
I think he boots everybody I add out so so yeah if anyone has Dan's isn't his Gunstar

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.640
underscore hero.

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.640
Uh I don't remember to be honest.

01:54:54.640 --> 01:55:00.120
Yeah Dan's is Gunstar hero and he um boots people that he doesn't recognize and so he's

01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:05.800
booted some people that I added on there so if you add him and he boots you don't be offended

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:07.320
it's not me it's my husband.

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:08.320
Loki are you full yet?

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.200
No I think I'm like 70 something.

01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:12.980
So Loki O-L-R right?

01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:14.800
Loki space O-L-R all caps.

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:15.800
There you go.

01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:20.800
Um thanks for uh taking the time to answer my questions as it's highly appreciated um

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.800
take care.

01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:24.640
That's a really nice letter thank you.

01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:27.720
I add everybody but you know don't expect me to play with you during the middle of the

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:34.600
day when I'm at work doing our two 15 minute multiplayer games we'll ignore your invites.

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:37.560
Yeah don't just because yeah that's another thing because this kind of happened lately

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:41.600
is that I I'm without fail I always get invited to games please don't be offended if I turn

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.800
them down but keep in mind sometimes when I turn on the Xbox I have a game in mind I

01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.320
want to play I don't want to go back like I don't even know where my copy of Halo 3

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:51.800
is and like from several people I get Halo 3 invites please don't be offended when I

01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:53.800
decline them I just don't that's not the game I feel like playing.

01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:57.200
Yeah see I get Grand Theft Auto 4 invites when I'm not playing it and Nellie's playing

01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:02.320
like Zuma or Bejeweled so you know but usually then I'll be smart and I'll make it look like

01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:03.320
I'm offline so.

01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:04.320
Nice.

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:05.320
You know.

01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:06.320
I don't know.

01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:07.320
Alright.

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:11.440
Uh but I do certain random things will happen like uh I got into a random Uno game the other

01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:14.920
night with some All Games people and we had a we had a good time Bobby got in on it too

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:15.920
it was fun.

01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:19.400
I'm going you know Grand Theft Auto games every now and then you know I just haven't

01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:20.400
lately.

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:21.400
Right.

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:23.840
Like right now it's all about Braid right now and Geometry Wars which sadly are not

01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.520
multiplayer so uh may if you catch me in a good mood I can do Soul Calibur 4 if you catch

01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:33.160
me in a Soul Calibur mood anyhow sorry uh was that it for mailbag?

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:34.160
I think it was.

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.160
I just yeah.

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:40.240
Alright so send us more mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com SSG100Matt in chat says dear Microsoft expand

01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:41.240

K thanks.

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:43.240
I agree.

01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:44.240
Uh Loki next story.

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:49.640
Well uh I don't know if this is like you know important or anything but G4 has announced

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:57.920
the winners of the G4ia 2008 awards which were voted on by the fans who cares?

Most deserving of an Ooey Bowl movie, Turok.

01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:51.880
And longest lasting game presented by Stride, Grand Theft Auto 4.

01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:53.480
And then the awards were over!

01:57:53.480 --> 01:58:00.520
I just saved you about 3 hours or 2 hours or however long this damn ceremony goes.

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:02.880
JV Mon says Grand Theft Auto 4 kinda sucked.

01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:06.120
He's in the minority but Niko is the best video game character in a long time.

01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:10.080
It's not that Grand Theft Auto was like super duper awesome I mean cause it was pretty awesome

01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:16.640
but Halo 3 wasn't that awesome let me put it that way I don't know it wasn't groundbreaking

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:17.640
I think.

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:21.240
Yeah Halo 3 wasn't quite the like the Halo 2 was.

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.240
Halo 3 new paint job.

01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:26.660
I've mentioned this before and this is seriously like I know a lot of people call this the

01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:31.600
cop out thing but there's a certain X factor the games need to be graded on a little bit.

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:35.840
You know like I said earlier like Space Giraffe kinda just was missing that uh the Tempest

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:39.440
2000 hat and it's hard to put your finger on what that is but it's like the X factor

01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:40.440
you know what I mean?

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.440
Yeah.

01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:46.960
And that's the same thing with Halo 3 it was just missing that something.

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:53.440
The most descriptive game review you'll ever get in your life uh anyhow chad.orangelandrater.com

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:57.920
if you want to comment on that uh meanwhile hey the long time chatters will love this

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:02.760
an Eye of Judgment tournament who knew that game was still going on actually apparently

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:06.820
it's got its fans they are actually going to be doing a world championships over the

01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:12.760
playstation network on August 14th so uh get your playstation eyes hooked up and get ready

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:18.460
to go with your uh official booster packs cause I know you didn't copy cards or nothing.

01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:23.720
It's pretty cool it's uh officially happening on the playstation network on August 14th.

01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:32.120
You can actually duel uh the creator of Eye of Judgment from Japan Studio if you uh are

01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:33.600
so lucky to in this game.

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.880
I don't know if they're actually doing like a tournament style thing or if this is one

01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:40.360
of those hey why doesn't everybody play this game online at the same time so there's lots

01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.360
of people playing.

01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:46.580
I don't know exactly what it is but uh sounds like it could be interesting.

01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:51.440
So there you have it play some Eye of Judgment on August 14th if you actually have it.

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:57.600
Well even so you've got more incentive to be able to uh play Eye of Judgment and this

01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:01.760
is great news for Loki although it's probably not going to help at all.

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:08.240
The Circuit City has um Eye of Judgment and the playstation eye for uh $40.

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:10.880
It's on sale.

02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:13.720
And Walmart has it for $30.

02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:19.080
Well it's time to go buy those things off the shelves let's start moving them.

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:21.120
I think I might actually go pick up one.

02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:24.560
There you go that's one in a million only $999,999 more to go.

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:28.120
If it's at Walmart for $30 hell yeah I'll get it just to have the webcam.

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:32.040
It's a good price for the uh playstation eye cause I think the playstation eye buy it sells

02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:33.040
like $39.99.

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:36.880
Yeah that's actually really I even I would pick it up just because someday I'll probably

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:37.880
get a playstation through.

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:40.680
I might pick it up to burn it.

02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:45.080
Well I'd pick it up to have the webcam cause you can use the webcam on your PC and it's

02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:46.600
better than the webcam I have now.

02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:50.480
I don't use my webcam for anything other than taking random pictures but you know.

02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:54.360
The webcam we use for OLR's just in TV is an actual video camera at this point.

02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:55.760
But we used to use an eye right?

02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.280
We used to use an eyesight.

02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:58.280
That was it.

02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:59.280
That's what we used to use.

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:00.280
And then it broke cause I dropped it on the ground.

02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:02.360
Before that we used to use an eye toy.

02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:08.640
We did for a little while use an eye toy that oh man that was back in the day.

02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:10.400
Good times.

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:15.880
So uh lots of Eye of Judgment news around aren't you excited Loki?

02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:18.000
I was the one that posted the story so.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
They're desperate.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.440
I'm well aware of what's going on in the Eye of Judgment world or the lack thereof of what's

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:27.000
going on in the Eye of Judgment world.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.280
Well something that's about as ridiculous as playing a card game over your PS3.

02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:34.840
How about installing Windows Vista on your PS3?

02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.440
Yeah well you can do it.

02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:39.960
That doesn't really mean it's going to work well.

02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:46.760
Basically the guy installed a version of Linux on his other partition of his hard drive.

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.560
And in Linux emulated Windows Vista.

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:57.400
And well it takes 25 minutes to boot and 5 minutes to access the start menu and about

02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:59.200
12 minutes to open Notepad.

02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:01.680
12 minutes to open Notepad?

02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:03.520
12 minutes to open Notepad.

02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:05.920
Power up the cell processor.

02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:06.920
Wow.

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:11.960
No but seriously though I mean you're emulating an operating system within an operating system.

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.680
Within an operating system basically.

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:16.000
Misty says my thoughts exactly in chat.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.640
She says ew it's bad enough on PC.

02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:27.800
And to be honest Windows Vista just runs like that so you know really stick with Linux.

02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:28.800
There you have it.

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:29.800
Or Minty.

02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:31.800
I almost said Misty Linux.

02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:32.800
I bet you'd be excited.

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:33.800
Or Minty Linux.

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:38.040
Well I don't know if you can install Minty Linux on a PS3.

02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:41.420
I think it only takes Yellow Dog or something like that.

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:42.600
How about Misty Linux?

02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:45.120
Would that be like a OLR based Linux system?

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:46.120
Misty Linux?

02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:47.120
Misty Linux.

02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:48.120
Instead of Minty Linux.

02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:49.120
It's like emo Linux.

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:50.120
You know.

02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:51.120
Oh my eyes are Misty.

02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:52.120
No no.

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:53.560
Like our listener Misty.

02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:54.560
Not like.

02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:55.560
Oh forget it.

02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:56.560
Yeah I know Misty.

02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:57.560
Our listener.

02:02:57.560 --> 02:02:58.560
Forget it.

02:02:58.560 --> 02:02:59.560
I got that.

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:00.560
I understood that.

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:01.560
I was taking the joke further.

02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:03.760
But she's Misty after the Pokemon girl with pigtails.

02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:06.680
Remember back in the day?

02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.680
Forget it.

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:08.680
Yeah back in the day when I played Pokemon.

02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:11.880
Let me think back to that day.

02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:12.880
It doesn't exist.

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:16.360
I hate you.

02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:17.360
Just kidding.

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:18.360
Just kidding.

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:21.960
But I will like you a whole lot Loki if you get this for me.

02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:23.440
It's Little Big Planet.

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:25.220
Of course you'd have to buy me a PS3 as well.

02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:27.220
So get working on that.

02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:28.220
Little Big Planet.

02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:32.160
If you actually pre-order this game it was revealed by the official US PlayStation blog

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:37.440
that apparently there are five separate pre-order bonuses that you can get in North America.

02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:40.360
It all depends on where you're going to reserve the game.

02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:45.000
They haven't said where you reserve it will get you what prize just yet.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.160
But one of them is a Kratos Sackboy.

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:49.800
That's Kratos from God of War.

02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:53.520
This little Sackboy which is one of the ugliest fucking looking things I've ever seen in my

02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:54.520
life.

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.600
I think you get all five if you pre-order.

02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:58.800
But that's a lot though.

02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:02.240
There's a Sackgirl for Nariko from Heavenly Sword.

02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:06.780
There's Little Big Pouch, a burlap sack that can fit a...

02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:07.780
That's awesome.

02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:09.320
I'm going to pre-order a game and get a burlap sack.

02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:10.320
That's rad.

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.880
A Little Big Sticker Book which is a sticker book.

02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:20.080
And the official Little Big Planet Creator Guide by Brady Games, but only the mini guide.

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:22.400
It's the little guide for the little game.

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:23.720
So I wouldn't think you would get...

02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:25.880
I think it's kind of cute.

02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:26.880
That is ugly.

02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:27.880
I bet the Nariko ones better.

02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:28.880
Oh, I think it's cute.

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:29.880
To be honest...

02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:30.880
It looks like a poop.

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:31.880
To be honest, I am nice.

02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:32.880
No, it's good.

02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:34.880
Your butt looks like a poop.

02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:36.240
Well, thank you.

02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:39.280
I'm not really too excited about the God of War and Heavenly Sword, so...

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:41.960
I was looking at the one for the Heavenly Sword one is actually...

02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:46.200
Okay, the burlap sack is like a zipper pouch.

02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:47.560
It's cute.

02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:51.480
I would get the Little Big Pouch or the Nariko if it doesn't look as hideous as the Kratos

02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:52.480
one.

02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:54.280
Oh, so cute.

02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:55.800
The Heavenly Sword one is really cute.

02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:56.800
She looks like a Fraggle.

02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:57.800
Well, you...

02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.960
Now, Fraggles are rad.

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.800
Do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?

02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:04.400
Dude, they should.

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:09.480
Loki, do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?

02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:11.760
Maybe on like the ColecoVision or something like that.

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:13.720
Okay, they need a new Fraggle Rock game.

02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:18.800
Well, you can wait for the remake of the Fraggle Rock, or especially a Fraggle Rock movie.

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:23.760
They're gonna do a remake, I guess, of it or something, and then there'll be a video

02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:26.260
game coming out for it.

02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:28.520
As long as it doesn't suck.

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:29.520
Right, DarkSakura?

02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:31.580
If it sucks, then it sucks.

02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:34.860
It's gonna be a remake of a series that a lot of people have forgotten about.

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:36.120
I'm sure it's gonna suck.

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:39.520
No one can forget about Fraggle Rock.

02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:40.520
Not while I'm around.

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:41.520
Ever.

02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:42.520
Ever.

02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:48.320
Well, this is something that no one will ever be able to forget once they've heard of it,

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:58.760
is there's a shooter series that stars heavily-muscled men wearing Speedos, and it's called...

02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:04.240
It's the Cho-Aniki games, and there is going to be a new Cho-Aniki game on PSP.

02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:07.360
Now, that's a series that needs to make a comeback.

02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:13.320
Zero Cho-Aniki, which is a remake of the original Cho-Aniki.

02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:16.920
And it's funny, the screen capture that I'm looking at looks like they're fighting a very

02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:22.640
muscular version of Jack, like Jack in the Box, you know, because he's got the pointy

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:23.640
nose and the eyes.

02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:24.640
The big balloon head.

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:25.640
I know!

02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:30.260
But he's like, uber muscled, and he's got like a little thingy over his, you know, pee-pee.

02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:33.960
Did they wuss out on the subtle gay porn hints, though?

02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:36.280
I don't think so at all.

02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:43.120
But, you know what, I told my husband in no uncertain terms that I'm importing zero Cho-Aniki.

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:45.400
And you should also tell him that you're going to make him buy it.

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:48.160
I don't know, I told him.

02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:49.160
Nice.

02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:55.840
Also, my friend who introduced me to Linux Mint says no Mint on PS3 as of yet, sorry.

02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:56.840
Darn.

02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:58.440
I had to spread that on air.

02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:00.280
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.

02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:01.280
That's alright.

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:05.920
Game Guru says, also, why, why Cho-Aniki, why?

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:07.520
Because Cho-Aniki is cool!

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:11.600
And Game Guru would also like to point out that the Fragglerock redo is coming from Jim

02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:12.880
Hansen and Disney.

02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:13.880
So hopefully that's a good sign.

02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:15.840
It's coming from beyond the grave.

02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:16.840
Exactly.

02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:18.720
Thank God.

02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:24.720
So there's a couple neat, I guess, mods that have come out for the PSP.

02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:32.760
The first is actually someone that has basically put a cell phone inside of a PSP, where the

02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:34.540
UMD drive goes.

02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:38.080
And so now it's a PSP phone.

02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.080
Awesome.

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:41.440
It kind of looks retarded.

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:44.840
But hey, it's a phone and it's a PSP.

02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.240
Something a little bit more functional, though.

02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:49.120
Is there anything this device can't do?

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:54.320
Something a little bit more functional, though, another modder has incorporated a touchscreen

02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:56.040
to the PSP.

02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:59.020
That a little bit better, I would say.

02:07:59.020 --> 02:08:03.640
And that project now is called the Touchscreen Project for the PSP.

02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:11.680
It's on a website called pspzproject.dcemu.co.uk.

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:19.640
Dude, DCEMU, I remember that site.

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:20.640
That was...

02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:23.960
My Dreamcast got more action from that website than any game.

02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:24.960
Exactly.

02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:28.040
Remember, was it Feed a Fury?

02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:30.000
Heck yeah.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.280
So yeah, it's interesting.

02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:39.160
Basically he's allowed it to, I guess, have better battery life somehow.

02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:42.040
They've redesigned the control pad and some other crap.

02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:45.920
And he's working on a keyboard application for it.

02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:47.440
I don't know, I think that's pretty neat.

02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:53.520
It would be kind of cool to have a touchscreen on the PSP, because for the love of God, typing

02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:55.800
on that thing sucks.

02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:01.400
Alright, so wow, we've had Wii hacks and now PSP hacks.

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:05.240
The hackers sure are busy.

02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:08.160
We're going to end tonight, before we go to the Skype line, with a story that I know is

02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:11.200
going to surprise you guys, it's going to knock the socks off of you.

02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:12.720
You're never going to believe it.

02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:18.600
But brace yourselves, Grand Theft Auto 4 is coming to the PC, y'all.

02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:19.600
What?

02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:20.780
Shock, huh?

02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:22.840
I never would have guessed.

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:23.840
That is unheard of.

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:27.920
I never would have guessed, based on the 50 leaks that came out earlier.

02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:33.360
Well, Rockstar finally admitting it, saying, quote, we are very excited to be releasing

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:36.000
the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.000
The whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the PC.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.600
The game looks and plays beautifully on PC, and we can't wait for people to play it.

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:49.480
It is coming out November 18th in North America, November 21st in Europe.

02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:52.520
There is a reason why this is following a story about hacking.

02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:53.920
Oh, yeah.

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:55.800
That is all I'm going to say.

02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:58.040
That is all I'm going to say.

02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.040
Have fun.

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:00.760
Just in time for Christmas for the hacking community.

02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:01.760
Oh, my god.

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:02.760
It's going to be so awesome.

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:05.960
The other thing, too, what's kind of cool about it, though, is they do have some expanded

02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:07.940
multiplayer options in there as well.

02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:11.700
No word on what that is exactly, but there are going to be some new multiplayer features.

02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:15.240
Not that it would matter anyways, because people would add it anyways and recreate all

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:17.400
new cities and all sorts of mods.

02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:18.400
I cannot wait.

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:19.400
Can't wait.

02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:20.400
Awesome.

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.240
We're going to open up the Skype line now for your calls.

02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:27.320
Orange Launch Radio is our username on Skype, or if you're feeling so inclined, you can

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:28.320
pick up the phone.

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:32.120
1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll-free number in the US and Canada.

02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:35.360
Unfortunately, if you're overseas, you're going to want to stick to Skype.

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:37.080
We're not going to pay your phone bill, kids.

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:41.080
So 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, is Orange Launch Radio.

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:42.920
We're going to move into some last-minute stories.

02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:47.000
I'll start tonight, and I'm not using a source or anything for this, but it's something when

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.860
I was listening to Bobby's show, I heard him mention it, and I realized we neglected to

02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:52.560
put it on our own show roll.

02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:56.400
Believe it or not, GameTap apparently has gone under.

02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:57.400
Did you guys hear this?

02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:59.400
GameTap actually went under this week.

02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:00.400
Really?

02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:01.400
Yeah.

02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:02.400
Well, I got sold.

02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:03.400
I'm sorry.

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:06.040
It didn't implode or go under.

02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:07.040
It closed completely.

02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:08.040
No, no, no.

02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:10.520
It's being sold as a property out of Turner.

02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:14.300
So sorry if I misrepresented that, which is good that apparently the stream went down

02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:16.240
right at that moment that I said that.

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:17.240
Did it?

02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:18.240
Yeah.

02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:19.400
It's back up now, but we had a weird hiccup in the connection.

02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.120
I was about like, oh.

02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:22.960
But anyway, yeah, because the chat room is going crazy.

02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:26.040
But anyway, oh shoot, Justin TV caught me saying it.

02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.040
But yeah, no.

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:30.080
Turner sold it off, or is looking to sell it off apparently.

02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:33.360
So we'll see.

02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:35.240
Any other last-minute stories while we wait for some calls?

02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:39.120
Again, since the stream went dead, 1877 GameoLR, the Skype line is open.

02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:40.120
Or username on Skype.

02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:41.120
You want to hear something funny?

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:42.120
What, Loki?

02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:45.840
Okay, anyways, I was reading up a little bit more on that Mushroom Kingdom fusion.

02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:47.160
They've got a bunch of different levels.

02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:51.520
They have the Mushroom Kingdom, Alternate Earth, Mega Man's Realm, the Demon Realm,

02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:57.680
which is based on Doom games, Genneta, Shoot Em Up's domain, Realm of the Nintendo, Sonic

02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:01.200
Universe, Halo Ring World, Twisted Reality, and Minus World.

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:07.320
But in the Demon World, the boss is Loki.

02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:08.480
How appropriate.

02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:09.480
Let's go to the Skype line.

02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:10.480
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:11.480
Who's this?

02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:12.480
It's the legend, Zaku.

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:13.480
What's up?

02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:14.480
Hey, Zaku.

02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:15.480
What's on your mind?

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:16.480
Long time, no talk.

02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:17.480
Just random things.

02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:18.480
Let me see.

02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:19.480
The fact.

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:24.480
I'm just trying to find some stuff.

02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:30.520
Yeah, that whole Mad Knight, which apparently is affecting me and others.

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:32.360
How does Mad Knight affect you?

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:38.120
Well, my, you know, my thugnificent little brother, who plays it out of spite of the

02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:43.120
fact that he's all full of the whole hip hop thing, he just plays it because he knows how

02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:45.080
to make money off of it.

02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:47.920
How exactly do you make money off of Madden?

02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:50.880
Through League, through League play.

02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:54.840
Are you talking online currency, or are you talking about some type of shady, oh, okay.

02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:55.840
Real money.

02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:56.840
Real money through Madden.

02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:57.840
Yes.

02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:58.840
Through League.

02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:00.320
He did that through NBA Live recently.

02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:06.280
He and a bunch of other players basically did it through MLG and something like that.

02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:11.560
I never realized there was this whole underground betting activity going on on Madden and video

02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:12.560
games.

02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:13.560
Oh, yeah.

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:14.560
It's what you think with Madden and all those others.

02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:16.040
Is your brother making off this?

02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:21.840
Well, actually, the team that he's in, he hasn't told me any specifics, but he did make

02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:25.800
a lot, but most of the money is going to the team.

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.080
What does the team buy, shirts or a whole lot of pot?

02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:33.880
No, just to pay off their players, I guess.

02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:38.720
I don't get it, so then your brother is making money if he's paying off the players?

02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:44.440
Well, he's actually in the League, so he's actually making money, you know, the earnings

02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:49.360
are split pretty much amongst all the other players in his team.

02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:53.280
So if I get good at Madden, which will never happen, if I get good at Madden, I could make

02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:56.880
money off of it on this whole underground gambling circuit?

02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:58.280
Yes, you could.

02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.240
They do hold those things from what I hear.

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:07.560
They hold them and they pretty much hold the underground Madden sessions where they bet

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:10.880
big dollars for each game.

02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:11.880
Underground Madden?

02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:16.400
Is it like a rave where a bus comes to pick you up to take you to an unmarked building?

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:22.000
No, it's just at the private meetups, just like, you know, at people's houses where they

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.800
just like, you know, they play Madden for money, which is kind of, you know, I mean,

02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:32.160
I can't imagine, you know, any other game, maybe DDR, unless, you know, you put money

02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:33.160
on...

02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:35.840
Well, I don't see an underground DDR betting circle starting anytime soon.

02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:40.480
I mean, it could happen, think about it, you could basically put money on the number of

02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:46.320
greats you get, you know, per song, like the less number of greats, you know...

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.920
If there's money to gamble, someone's going to gamble it.

02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:50.720
We live in a risk-taking world, I suppose.

02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:55.020
God, I don't know why I find this so fascinating, but I do, it's like, I want to see a documentary

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.020
done on this shit.

02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:59.400
Uh, Zaku, okay, I'll try to get back on top of you, anything else you want to comment

02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:00.400
on on tonight's show?

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:01.400
Any of the other stories?

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:07.160
Um, besides digital life being held next month, coinciding with an anime convention also being

02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:13.120
held in the same place, that's pretty much it, you know, next month, digital life, $3,000.

02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:14.640
What are you most looking forward to about digital life?

02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:17.520
I know there was a little bit of disappointment all around last year, what are you looking

02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:20.820
for them to most improve, what are you looking forward to this year?

02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:25.480
I have no idea, I just want to, I don't know, if there's, if they have more, you know, they

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:30.080
have more like game, you know, game developers showing up instead of all this other like

02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:35.760
marketing crap, I mean, besides all the schwag that you get for free, you know, you could

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:40.040
use a, could use a few more games, like in 06, which was really good, they had like the

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:43.360
Wii and everything, you know, before it came out.

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:47.080
Alright, alright, well, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but

02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:52.040
thanks for calling in, and uh, um, good luck to your brother, hope he can make your family

02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:53.040
a lot of money.

02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:56.140
Yeah, I hope so too, maybe, I don't know.

02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:57.140
Maybe you can ask for a loan.

02:15:57.140 --> 02:15:59.140
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:00.640
Bye.

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:04.680
Get a loan out to get some of that DDR crack or something, that's, maybe, maybe if he wins

02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:07.680
enough money, he can get a 2DX machine for the house, what do you think?

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:08.680
Sounds good, huh?

02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:11.200
Would you, would you ever bet on a video game real money?

02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:17.040
I'm like, I'm, I love gambling, but it ends at like slot machines, nickel size at the

02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:18.040
casino.

02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:20.320
Rob, I don't play the lottery.

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:21.320
Isn't it, but isn't it fascinating?

02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:25.280
The only closest I've ever done to it is a lottery pool at work, where I was only out

02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:26.280
$2.

02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:29.760
Isn't that fascinating, though, that there's this whole like betting on Madden circuit?

02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:31.160
I think it's freaking sad.

02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:32.840
It is in a way, but it's, it's...

02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:35.160
I don't think gambling is fun.

02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:41.400
I don't like to give up money where I know it can go towards something useful.

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:43.320
Like one or two dollars, that's nothing.

02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:49.960
I can, I'll every so often do like a dollar card at the gas station, but I wouldn't put

02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:53.200
up anything more than $5.

02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:57.360
For me, I, I'm willing to raise the stakes a little bit, like $20.

02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.800
Most I think I've ever gambled in a night, it's like $60.

02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:03.560
And I go, well, $60 is what I might spend on a video game or spend, you know, but I

02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:04.560
always set a limit.

02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:07.120
I don't take my ATM card into those places because it's dangerous.

02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:09.900
You go in with a set amount of money and you don't expect to walk out with it.

02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:11.400
And then you're okay.

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:14.280
Anyway, not that I should be endorsing gambling.

02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:18.640
But once in a while, it's not gonna, it's okay.

02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:23.160
You don't, you, people know their tolerance is the best for themselves.

02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:27.040
So the Skylines are open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:30.160
The username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio, while we wait to see if we get any more calls.

02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:32.480
Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us otherwise?

02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:34.440
I'm still reading more of that wiki.

02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:38.000
Actually, there's one thing here that's kind of funny.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.160
On Machima.com, they have a video for, you know how they have all those meet the, you

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:45.880
know, classes of characters in Team Fortress 2?

02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:48.240
Well, they have meet the cow.

02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:55.080
I guess it's some cardboard cow or some wood cutout cow that's in Team Fortress 2 and it's

02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:56.080
pretty funny.

02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:57.080
All right.

02:17:57.080 --> 02:17:58.080
We have another call.

02:17:58.080 --> 02:17:59.080
Let's go to the phones.

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:00.080
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:01.080
Who is this?

02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:04.760
This is the one from Sweden.

02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:06.600
Our Swedish friend.

02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:09.920
I was hoping you'd call tonight with all the ABBA references we were making earlier in

02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:10.920
the show.

02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:11.920
No, I'm just, I'm...

02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:12.920
What's that?

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:17.280
It wasn't about that, though, but, well, hell.

02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:18.280
That's all right.

02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:19.280
I'm just messing with you.

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:20.280
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:26.040
Well, I, well, the system specs for Age of Reckoning.

02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:28.880
Warhammer has been, finally been released.

02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:33.600
I don't know if you actually did mention it, but, well, it has been released.

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:36.400
Tell us a little bit about it.

02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:43.840
The system specs for Warhammer Online has been released, which is a basic single core

02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:57.160
Tenseum 4, 2.4, and mostly, like, a gig of RAM, if you run AXP or Vista, and if you're

02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:59.640
running Vista, you need two.

02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:08.000
Other than that, you need an average modern video card, and that's, you're ready to go.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.080
That sounds like most anyone can run this, if you have a modern PC.

02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:13.080
Yeah.

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:24.760
Since they're aiming for, aiming for, basically, the WoW, the WoW scale of players, even though

02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:34.160
I'm quite a bit surprised, since, at least in my case, I'm running really on a, as current

02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:44.920
state, unfortunately, a big, low generation 7 Geforce card, and that one isn't supported.

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:56.480
And the funny thing is that mostly low, mostly low ATI cards are supported, but the Nvidia

02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.960
ones are not.

02:19:57.960 --> 02:20:02.160
Here's the weird thing, you said that this game is out there, it's gonna be a potential

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:06.120
challenger to WoW as a lot of games have been claiming to be lately, but when your specs

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:11.960
are so high, you know, relatively high, I think, you know, the thing about WoW, it runs

02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:16.400
on pretty crappy systems, and Max, where you don't even have a whole lot of games, WoW,

02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:20.160
Blizzard's always been about having the games on both, so how much of a dent can they really

02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:21.160
make?

02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:22.160
Nah.

02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:25.440
I don't know.

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:29.080
It'll take some people away, you know what, there'll be little bits and pieces that'll

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:30.360
take people away from WoW.

02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:40.120
For instance, Dark Soccer and I both agree, the day Star Trek Online comes out, which

02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:44.800
we saw some information about today, and we're watching the trailers, bye bye WoW, for a

02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:45.800
little while at least.

02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:48.800
But I'm not quitting Ragnarok.

02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:50.280
All the cool kids are quitting their games.

02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:51.800
I'm sorry, go ahead.

02:20:51.800 --> 02:21:01.680
Pardon me, but I'm not that big a fan of Star Trek Geek, so I can't really say anything.

02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:10.520
The only space science fiction MMO I played for a while was EVE Online, which, wow, is

02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:15.040
sort of fun, even though, if you really ought to break it down on EVE, just on the EVE

02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:21.880
front is Biff Gear's big Excel spreadsheet, so...

02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:22.880
Awesome.

02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:26.200
Bobby Blackwolf says in chat right now, I want to join Rob's fleet in Star Trek Online.

02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:28.000
Dude, I'm gonna have a fleet.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
That's gonna be great.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.640
Anyway, I want to be Captain Sassy Pants.

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:33.640
Anyway.

02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:38.800
It's gonna be awesome.

02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:40.440
Captain Sassy Pants of the U.S.S.O.L.R.

02:21:40.440 --> 02:21:43.080
Anyway, I'm sorry, we're getting off track, I know you didn't want to talk about Star

02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:44.680
Trek because you're not that big a geek.

02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:47.800
But go ahead.

02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:48.800
Go ahead.

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:49.800
Finish your thought, because we're gonna get going.

02:21:49.800 --> 02:22:01.380
Other than that, I've been, had the opportunity to try out Age of Conan, and, well, I'm not

02:22:01.380 --> 02:22:03.920
that impressed, really.

02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.560
You didn't cyber with anyone in the game, did you?

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:08.040
No, I didn't.

02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:09.040
No, I didn't.

02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:10.040
Good.

02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:11.040
Good.

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:12.920
It sounds like you didn't think it was too high.

02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:14.240
What did you not enjoy about it?

02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:16.480
What turned you off?

02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:25.120
It's really the combat system that it's, well, it's, we, ugh.

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:31.360
Or maybe just, I need to learn to play, really, but, well.

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:35.600
The combat system wasn't saved by the fact that you could lob people's heads off?

02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:42.480
No, I didn't lob any heads off, I think, no.

02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:46.760
But it might be also due to the following fact that I'm running, really, my computer

02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:54.560
that I'm running Age of Conan on is really a lowest possible you can run on.

02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:58.840
Out of curiosity, just to try and wrap things up, and I gotta wrap up the call, but, you

02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:02.000
know, we talk about all these computer parts and high-end stuff.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.040
You live in Sweden, and, you know, not that Sweden's like a third-world country by any

02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:08.040
means.

02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:11.080
I mean, obviously, it's a big part of, you know, the whole cluster of countries over

02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:15.280
there on the other side of the pond, but do you get a lot of the high-end stuff as we

02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:16.860
get it here?

02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:19.640
Or do you find that you guys lag behind a little bit?

02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:22.960
No, we don't lag behind at all.

02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:30.240
It's just me that's not, that don't have the possibility to dish out to...

02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:35.240
No, I know, we're poor here, too, I'm poor, but, well, I am gonna probably dish out the

02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:39.080
money because I did a second job recently, but that's alright.

02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:49.400
Yeah, well, if you have the opportunity, you can, it's really easy to dish out a few bucks,

02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:55.040
so you can get a respectable gaming system, so it's no problem at all.

02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:56.040
Alright.

02:23:56.040 --> 02:23:59.200
Well, hey, we gotta let you go, buddy, we're running out of time, but thanks so much for

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:01.480
your call, as always, and letting us know how the weather is on the other side of the

02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:02.480
pond.

02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:03.480
Oh, well.

02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:04.480
We appreciate it.

02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:05.480
Take care, buddy.

02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:06.480
Take care, buddy.

02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:09.200
We're gonna go ahead and close up the Skype line and take any of the last minute stories

02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:11.800
we have here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:14.560
We have something else we're trying to get to live tonight, just for the live folks on

02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:18.200
AllGames.com, so, anything else you guys have tonight?

02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:19.720
I wish I could read German.

02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:22.520
Why, is there a good German story in the works?

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:27.680
No, I'm finding out Linux install stuff, but the file I found was in German.

02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:30.600
You're gonna become a Linux nerd by next week.

02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:34.360
Loki, any other final thought, or, I'm sorry, any last minute stories?

02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:40.160
No, but I finally got that Super Mario Kingdom, Mushroom Kingdom Fusion thing to run.

02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:43.440
It takes about, like, 15 minutes to load, but it's supposedly worth it.

02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:44.440
Jeez, Louise.

02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:45.440
All right.

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:48.080
We're gonna do it, we're gonna wrap up the show, we're gonna go around and get everybody's

02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:49.080
final thoughts.

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:50.640
So, Loki, we'll start with you, your final thought.

02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:52.960
I can't wait to play this game.

02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:54.360
DarkSakura, your final thought?

02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:59.400
Dude, we are so going to see Journey, Heart, and Cheap Trick.

02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:01.600
That's freaking awesome.

02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:10.280
And my final thought is, I want to quote a Journey song, but not Don't Stop Believin'.

02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:12.600
When the lights go down in the city.

02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:14.120
When the lights go down.

02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:15.120
All right, that'll work.

02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:16.400
All right, have a good one, you guys.

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:19.500
Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Podcasting.

02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:22.120
You know what, we wouldn't be here without your guys' support.

02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:26.340
Again, all we ask if you like our show, tell a couple friends about the show, leave us

02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:29.900
some positive reviews out there on the internet on your favorite podcasting website like iTunes

02:25:29.900 --> 02:25:31.240
or Dig or what have you.

02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:35.200
Help us spread the word because we're pretty stretched for resources here at Orange Launch

02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:36.200
Radio.

02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:38.160
Sadly, there will be no live show next week.

02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:40.080
We're hoping to have something taped for you guys.

02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:44.360
Stay tuned to OrangeLaunchRadio.com for the details and don't worry, if you're saddened

02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:49.200
by the lack of shows here in August, PAX is going to more than make up for it because

02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:54.600
we will be bringing you something not only every day ourselves, but we'll be bringing

02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:56.640
you something with AllGames.com.

02:25:56.640 --> 02:25:59.920
It is going to be just information freaking overload.

02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:03.560
It's later this month, Labor Day weekend here on Orange Launch Radio.

02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:05.680
Yay!

02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:06.680
Have a good one, everybody.

02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:08.480
We'll see you next time here on Orange Launch Radio.

02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:12.200
