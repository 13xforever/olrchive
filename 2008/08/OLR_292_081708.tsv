15643	23982	The Guitar Hero be adding yet another instrument to the mix, Sony announces the iPad, and rumors of an Xbox motion controller
31633	35035	Hello everybody and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35075	41098	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41158	42419	We missed you last week.
42919	45260	Our aim is improving though, isn't it DarkSakura?
45541	46201	Jamie Summers.
46241	46641	Splat.
46841	48922	Lovely co-host of OLR.
48942	49923	Splatter.
49943	50403	Splat.
51144	55306	And speaking of shooting things, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
57018	68304	Who apparently spent this morning shooting people in the face Yes And getting shot in the face I went and played Airsoft, it's a new hobby I'm getting into now Nice, what is Airsoft for the uninitiated?
68344	81011	Airsoft is kind of like paintball, but instead of actually shooting balls of paint at people You have kind of like souped up BB guns that shoot plastic pellets at people And actually it doesn't hurt at all So you're not shooting balls at people's face?
81840	83361	We are shooting balls at people's face.
83661	84362	I'm not going to judge.
85223	86304	Tiny little white balls.
86804	87304	Okay.
88365	89766	Depending on their color babies.
91488	91848	All right.
92869	94570	But did you win or did you lose?
95291	96872	Actually, we won three.
96892	97893	How does one win or lose?
97993	98834	Just don't get shot?
99094	99614	You win.
99794	102276	No, because we had different scenarios for each one we played.
102296	108261	The first game we played was you had to occupy, there was like a, they call them kill houses.
108321	110223	They're basically little structures that they built.
110834	112056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
128034	151271	and you get the flag and then raise it and wave it in the air and then the last game was just played on the field sideways and was basically just kill the other team and it's kind of cool though because it's like a video game because you get different respawns so if you get shot you have to go back to this one spot and when three people get there you all respawn and stuff like that wow they actually say respawn that's cool
151491	153593	Are there video games based on this, out of curiosity?
153714	155075	I mean, not like dodgeball video games.
155115	156577	No, no Airsoft games.
156737	158238	Tons of paintball games, but no Airsoft.
158459	166267	The ever-present fourth co-host on our show, you, through the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and poor Leno in chat says, Airsoft rocks.
167911	168632	It's pretty fun.
169953	174556	I bought a P90, which is like the Stargate machine gun type thing.
175096	181181	Not because I like Stargate, because I don't, but just because it looks neat and it's shot well.
181561	183643	And then I have a sidearm as well.
183723	187686	So I was playing the entire game with a sidearm and the P90.
188006	190748	And actually at one point I charged at people with
191489	196873	P90 in one hand because you can fire it with one hand and then the sidearm and I got shot, but it was still fun.
197673	199815	DarkTetsuya says, wow, OLR is getting violent.
199855	201276	I know lots of gun talk tonight.
201836	203177	It's OLR gun night.
203257	204538	It's gun show night on OLR.
204578	206660	Did I tell you that I've got a rifle?
207160	209042	Oh my gosh, too many guns.
209402	211844	No, I have a .22 caliber rifle.
211864	214866	Dad's going to take me out shooting, but I told him that I wanted my own handgun.
215247	218549	That's one thing I have no interest in, unless it's a laser gun.
218609	219470	Laser guns are alright.
220161	221662	There was a very good point made.
222343	231609	If everybody in the country could have a concealed weapon on them, even if they did or didn't, do you think someone's going to be likely to attack someone who could be armed?
232129	237013	You know I'm still not a gun fan, but we're not going to talk politics tonight because we've got games to talk about.
237093	239194	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
240235	243377	It was Ragnarok-tastic.
244277	247460	I also played Final Fantasy VI while I had jury duty last week.
248120	249521	I don't think there's guns in Ragnarok.
250202	251083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
268328	277212	So I played some of that at, well, I had jury duty and I was very pissed off that I was one alternate away from getting on the trial.
277352	280633	And it was like a little three-day criminal trial and I was looking forward to it.
281333	285875	So I didn't get on the trial, disappointment, blah, blah, cry, cry, wham.
285975	287276	Aw, you don't get to do your civic duty.
288136	289837	Well, I mean, you kind of did, but you know what I mean.
290580	297943	Yeah, but I met some cool people and watched the Olympics, which was kind of eh.
298463	303645	And then really that's about all I played, except for playing a lot of Solitaire on my iPhone.
304066	305466	Do you have Michael Phelps fever?
305706	311549	I know this has nothing to do with video games, but at the same time he'll probably have a game or something named after him in the future.
311709	319692	I do not, but I did go looking at pictures on the interwebs today of people kissing during the Olympics, and there was a guy kissing his horse.
320868	322329	Thank you for watching!
337833	338774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
363792	366674	Oh, I'm armed and dangerous.
366714	367454	I've got two of them.
368274	369655	I'm armed and fabulous.
370035	376939	I have my humerus and my radius.
377599	377859	All right.
379260	382081	Loki, tell us something about your gaming week.
382101	383302	I have biceps brachii, too.
383802	385823	That doesn't involve guns or Michael Phelps.
386503	388945	Well, I can guarantee one of the two of those.
389947	391788	Michael Phelps sucks.
391888	393349	And I hope to God they don't make a game.
393669	402375	Because really, how exciting... Send that hate mail to Loki at OrangeLawnRadio.com How exciting could a game be that's all swimming?
402875	406717	I mean... Swimming and Wii Sports 2.
407097	407598	Wait for it.
408138	410339	The Olympic Games are boring enough.
410859	416001	Not the game as in the actual Olympics, but the games made about the Olympics.
416481	421922	Those are boring, let alone just cutting out all the other events that you might find exciting and just leaving swimming in there.
422222	427584	See, call me sick, but the things I like about the Olympics, I don't really like the dream stories about Michael Phelps.
427644	428985	I mean, yeah, great swimmer and all.
429025	430025	I'm not going to knock him, but...
430405	431726	That's the stuff that's boring to me.
432126	434307	I like the crazy stuff.
434427	436488	Like the craziness that happens in the Olympics.
436508	440410	Like the weightlifter who had to get the paramedics called in on him.
440831	444472	And Frisbee in chat says, who saw the Cuban guy get mad and kick the ref?
444753	446854	That's the kind of stuff I love about the Olympics.
446894	449355	Or the guy that bit the guy in the shoulder, the boxer.
449395	451696	The Jerry Springer stuff you won't see on NBC.
452557	456879	Do you have Blue on your friends list on LiveJournal?
457463	458704	No, sadly I do not.
458824	467009	He posted a translation of an article that I thought was a really sweet article, and I want to mention it real quick, about the South Korean women's handball team.
469531	487143	Because they were already going to win the bronze, but their coach called a timeout right before and put in all the old players, not old, but older players, that this would be their last Olympics, so that they could be in the winning match and all be the ones to take home the medal.
487523	487963	Interesting.
487983	490425	Because they wouldn't be able to do another Olympics.
490966	493968	And some of them were housewives and their children were watching.
494088	502774	And so he put, I think, four people that would have to retire after this Olympics in the match for the last few minutes of the game.
503561	504401	I'd be fucking pissed.
504481	506962	Why is it that all Olympic video games usually suck?
507022	510463	Like, I don't remember playing an Olympics video game thinking, wow, that was awesome.
510643	511103	You know what I mean?
511243	513164	Like, there's a lot of Olympic video games that are kind of crappy.
513184	514564	Because none of the crazy stuff happens in the video game.
514584	516345	That's, I think that's a darn good explanation.
516465	518565	We don't get that crazy stuff happening.
518845	520266	We need more craziness.
520746	526628	And whoever's developing London 2012 for, you know, next-gen consoles, make it happen.
526868	527408	Give us a crazy.
527488	528248	All right, I'm sorry.
528708	529569	Gaming week, my bad.
529869	530109	Anyways.
532645	534427	Well, the games I play... Sorry.
534767	539473	Joshi16 says, Someone should put Michael Phelps in place of Echo the Dolphin.
539493	540154	That would be cool.
541115	542056	That would be cool.
542116	542657	I'd play that.
543097	543938	Phelps the Dolphin.
543998	544799	Exactly, Frisbee.
545239	545660	Alright, sorry.
546040	547762	Chat.OrangeLawsRadio.com if you want to join this.
547782	548543	Michael the Phelps.
548763	549004	Alright.
549304	550504	Loki.
551024	556106	So I play basically Bionic Commando Rearmed, which is awesome, and I love Bionic Commando.
556826	561887	So pretty much the game is as frustrating as the original, which is fine.
562947	565428	And I don't know, I enjoy it quite a bit.
566228	570569	And then I played more Grand Theft Auto 4, because that's what I do.
571229	574490	And I just have to address this because I have had a lot of people...
575404	576164	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
596016	611409	and I've tried to get other people in there but they don't want outside people playing so sorry but in the evening you have to set up certain hours exactly and I'm not trying to be rude and I would love to type back to you but I'm limited on time and
612216	615638	Typing on the fucking Xbox controller sucks.
616258	619980	You need to get a light-up USB keyboard like mine.
620260	621461	I have the chatpad.
621481	624182	I have it at home, but I don't have it at work.
624343	626844	And I don't have a headset at work either, so I can't tell you no.
626864	630066	I don't know.
630126	637790	Other than that, I meant to download Galaga Legions because that looked kind of cool, but I never did.
638030	639471	So I'm just not going to.
640620	645703	I am highly looking forward to this week though with the release of Castle Crashers.
646723	647844	Oh my god, it's going to be awesome.
648124	649504	So that's what I'll be playing.
649524	652186	I hope you're not pumping something up for disappointment.
652306	657388	That's why I have no feelings whatsoever about Castle Crashers.
657448	662811	Alien Hominid is pretty awesome and Castle Crashers, just all the video looks freaking awesome.
663735	663975	All right.
664396	664936	I got to say this.
664996	671181	Even though this was sent over a private message, and I usually don't encourage people to send me chat comments over a private message because it's a bit overwhelming, this is pretty funny.
671602	677687	TigerClaw, going on the Olympic thing, said, What about the one female water polo player who had her breasts exposed all over the net?
678388	680129	That's another good example of the dark side.
680169	681650	How did I miss that?
681690	684072	I know, because it's water polo, and I would never watch it.
684733	687756	But I'm thinking, you know, I could go for some boobs in my Olympic games.
688016	688676	Yes, DarkSakura?
688736	688917	Okay.
689517	690638	I'm looking on the internet right now.
691098	696402	Here's what we were talking about, because obviously when we were watching the Olympics, you have to heckle it because it's fun.
697323	703547	But we were watching men's diving, and I was like, wouldn't it be awesome if... Now, that's a sport I'll watch.
704208	711973	Wouldn't it be awesome if those diving boards had some sort of pneumatic thing on them that launched them into the air really high?
712374	713674	I mean, that would be fucking awesome.
713715	717137	They're doing like, you know, ten somersaults in the air and stuff.
717217	717898	I mean, come on.
718772	719633	Who wouldn't watch that?
719653	723137	And then they have BMX bike racing in this Olympics.
723397	725500	That's not really an Olympic sport.
725600	727422	Or a little Betty Hill style gag.
728612	730612	G-Squared68 asks if you're talking about the man cannon.
757458	758119	from Halo.
758199	758639	Exactly.
758839	760280	That's what they need to have, a man cannon.
760340	762162	That should be an Olympic event, man cannon.
762322	763483	Man cannon, I like that.
765215	766155	and Woman Cannon.
767496	772437	I smell a new list list or something like that.
772577	773817	A new dream game?
774297	776657	It's an expansion upon the dream games.
776717	777618	It's an Olympic event.
777818	778898	No, a list list.
779118	781218	The Olympic events that you'd want to see.
781999	783359	We might have to do that in the near future.
783799	789820	Maybe we can convince Bobby to do a live list list at PAX somehow when we're there for the panel, which we'll talk more about in a little while.
791100	793301	Moving on though, anything else in your gaming week you want to share, Loki?
793861	794822	That's all that I remember.
795382	797784	Alright, I actually haven't played a lot new this week.
797804	808671	I had a very busy personal life this week, and I don't feel right basing reviews off demos alone, but I will say I did at least play the demos for Force Unleashed, which I enjoyed.
808771	813054	I have some reservations about the full game, but I'll check out the full game and see if that carries over.
813614	817857	But I enjoyed myself more than I thought I would for a 3D action game, which usually isn't my kind of thing.
819018	821619	I'm not even that into Star Wars either, but I, you know...
822600	828904	I liked the Apprentice guy, Starkiller or whatever his name is, and Soulcalibur, and I thought, what the hell, I'll check out Force Unleashed, it might be fun.
830024	830905	It's interesting.
831445	831905	Very interesting.
832105	836888	I also checked out the new Galaga game on Xbox Live, the Galaga Legions, the new souped up one.
837188	838889	I had a lot of fun with the demo for that one.
838949	842191	I probably will end up upgrading to the full version and tell you more about it later.
843011	847414	But I was very pleased that it's much faster paced than the old Galaga games.
847534	847814	DarkSakura.com
870461	874704	Yeah, but the other big game that's been going on in our house, though, was Bionic Commando.
875184	875484	All right.
875504	876485	Yeah, I checked that out, too.
876505	877165	I did download that.
877185	877946	Yeah, made it easy.
878626	879627	I haven't played enough of it yet.
879667	881608	I don't want to review it yet, but I'm having fun with it.
882368	884930	And I really enjoy the new soundtrack, I've got to say.
884950	886110	I'm very happy with that.
886911	889152	Ryoma in chat says, I destroy it, Galaga.
889753	890093	Awesome.
890993	891294	All right.
892194	897337	DarkTetsuya says, and now representing the USA in the 1,000 meter man cannon, Rob Roberts.
899799	900099	Love it.
901731	906696	and Gerardimo in chat says Pac-Man Championship Edition is to Pac-Man as Galaga Legions is to our type.
908917	909598	Yeah, it's kind of true.
909618	912961	The Galaga Legions isn't really a lot like Galaga at all, actually.
913321	913842	But it's fun.
913862	915383	I had a really good time playing it.
915643	920808	I was thinking it was going to be too much like Geometry Wars and we just had that a few weeks ago, but it's different enough.
921527	922488	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
937648	938589	Allgames.com Allgames.com
957664	986513	but we'll also be doing our own stuff and we haven't exactly decided what we're doing I know there will be video involved to some extent because we want to shoot some video from the floor so we'll be showing you some things via our YouTube channel and giving you updates via our brand new Twitter which I also wanted to mention we have a brand new Twitter at twitter.com the username very easy OLR is our Twitter name so follow us on Twitter we'll be giving you updates from the floor letting you know what to expect and a couple podcasts from PAX as well it'll be fun
987571	989391	Are you guys getting excited about PAX?
989831	991392	What are you guys most looking forward to at PAX?
994332	995413	For me, the networking.
995833	999614	I can't wait to meet other podcasters because a whole crap load of them are going to be there.
999954	1003054	Not just in the All Games Network, but other indie podcasters.
1003434	1004375	I'm looking forward to the networking.
1004815	1007155	I want to see which celebrity I bump into this year.
1007975	1008456	Like at E3.
1008476	1008676	Loki?
1011181	1015043	I need to smack Konami upside their head because, seriously, I don't know what they're doing.
1015163	1016124	They're not showing it, Pax.
1016684	1017344	Well, good.
1017364	1020446	We don't have anything to show.
1020966	1028710	All right, if you guys want to meet us, we'll be around the show floor and most certainly at the All Games broadcast going on right by the Sumo Lounge.
1029091	1034293	All right, anyhow, let's move on and talk about... I plugged the Twitter, I plugged Penny Arcade Expo.
1034313	1035394	We'll be playing a promo...
1035814	1036454	Thank you for watching!
1056883	1080991	It's basically kind of a homemade version of the game, attacking the Twin Towers, and it has some sort of interactive elements with it where people can actually put their hand over this railing that's near the exhibit, and it will fire bullets up at the screen, killing the space invaders, but, you know, it's pretty much impossible to win, so the towers always get destroyed.
1082492	1086213	And apparently people, you know, are like, too soon, too soon, so...
1088208	1088708	I don't know.
1089408	1090509	It's interesting.
1090769	1108112	It's basically the Games Convention press release calls the installation an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy and a social tale that can be related to historical tales without losing its poetic power.
1109293	1110853	Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.
1112013	1113173	Sounds like art fluff.
1113313	1114234	Artsy speak.
1114674	1115434	I, you know...
1116584	1116924	I don't know.
1117484	1120805	I will give you my opinion here in just a second, but there's some more.
1121265	1144869	So, because this happened, of course, the news got back to Taito, who responded by saying that they had no idea that this sort of thing was going on, and of course, they obviously did not license Space Invaders for them to use, and they're going to take legal actions against the person who infringed upon their
1146242	1146642	Trademark.
1147923	1148923	Uh-oh.
1149823	1150823	But then what happened, Loki?
1151143	1156284	But then the artist who put it up there decided to pull it.
1157045	1170908	And basically, after three days of steady downward spiral in the public discussion of the piece, I have just given my agreement to the organizers of Leipzig Games Convention to simply turn off the installation Invaders.
1172422	1173123	and, uh, you know.
1173143	1175264	He had quite the little manifesto posted.
1175325	1177046	I mean, it wasn't quite, it was a manifesto.
1177206	1197982	Yeah, he's all, contrary to previous reports, I am American and it saddens me that people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside some obscure but tactically understood criteria of purely, um, let's see, uh, I have no idea what the hell he's trying to say here.
1198803	1199243	Eh, whatever.
1199724	1200144	Anyways, uh,
1203055	1203536	What do you think?
1203636	1204216	Fancy talk.
1204236	1204516	Anyways.
1204936	1209298	So, I think it's retarded that they took it down.
1209319	1212040	Because, I mean, you can interpret it in many ways.
1212300	1225867	One, you can interpret it as, I think, based on the fact that people can interact with it and actually fire bullets from the bottom of the screen, it's kind of invoking, like,
1227387	1231971	DarkSakura, I know you have strong opinions on this because I heard you on Bobby's show.
1232211	1234013	I see you typing it in chat now.
1234033	1234793	What do you think?
1251923	1253164	People need to learn to be offended.
1253864	1256186	Stop being a goddamn whiny bitch.
1256226	1258108	Get the stick out of your ass and deal with it.
1258828	1259629	That's the end of the story.
1259709	1260189	I'm sorry.
1260509	1261250	You don't like it.
1261350	1262631	Boo fucking hoo, okay?
1262951	1265073	I don't like having to go to work, but guess what?
1265173	1265653	I gotta.
1266213	1271457	I don't like hearing, you know, my husband yell at playing Grand Theft Auto 4, but guess what?
1271577	1272038	I gotta.
1272498	1273018	I married him.
1273058	1273659	It's my choice.
1274319	1275700	You know, you...
1276861	1282046	If you want to live in a country where you've got free speech, stay in America.
1282266	1282806	You've got it.
1283227	1284187	May as well flaunt it.
1284788	1288611	If you don't want your free speech, by all means, move to North Korea or something.
1291614	1300021	I think that if you want to be free to express your freedom of speech, you also need to let other people be free to express theirs.
1300461	1302763	If you do not like it, shut the fuck up.
1302803	1303744	That's what your blog is for.
1304488	1328972	or maybe if you didn't like it and you just probably didn't understand the piece and maybe if you asked the artist what he meant by it there you go but then again at the same time but at the same time though I kind of get from this you know artist or whatever he was just trying to invoke a reaction I'm sorry that's not an excuse for art no that's what art is to be for if you do a piece and no one reacts to it you have failed as an artist
1329574	1335000	I don't think that just making an artistic piece just to get a reaction is considered art.
1335320	1345592	Because if you think about it, if I paint a painting that I want people to think is sad, if I invoke a sad reaction, then yes, mission accomplished for me.
1346072	1348595	But if I paint a painting that's just
1349912	1352773	You know, offensive, and people get offended by it, I don't know.
1353053	1361915	That was your purpose, that's why you did the art, but the whole thing is that if people's comfort zones are not pushed, if people are not challenged to think, they're not going to.
1362335	1365876	It's gonna, you know, cause a very stagnant society.
1365936	1374138	I mean, even think about, you know, some of the greatest artists of their time were so unappreciated in their time, told that their work was crap, yet, you know...
1374938	1378022	years after they've died, they're now considered masterpieces.
1378042	1381186	They're considered the geniuses of their age, the innovators.
1381286	1387213	If we didn't have people that challenge the way that people think, then there would be, I think, no cultural progression.
1387333	1388494	That's what this is about.
1388995	1392880	I think the problem comes down to that it's space invaders and not geometry wars.
1394875	1400037	Look, I have an opinion on this too, which is I kind of like mostly agree.
1400197	1400658	Here's my thing.
1400698	1403619	I mostly agree because I'm all for free speech.
1403739	1405020	That's this country we live in.
1405420	1409102	This guy has a right to do – even though he's exhibiting in Germany, whatever.
1409522	1411923	I still support he has a right to say what he wants to say.
1412463	1416045	I personally may go, that wasn't very smart, and I might go –
1416845	1423730	The price you pay for expression is people disagreeing with you and going to be expressing their opinion in return.
1424090	1425651	That's kind of part of it.
1427412	1433256	If you open yourself up for that with your art, then you're going to get it back at you.
1433657	1434377	But here's the thing.
1435078	1436819	I actually understand why Taito's pissed.
1437247	1438628	Well, now I agree.
1438769	1442252	Pulling it because of the licensing issue, I agree with that.
1442452	1445715	He did use their licensed material without permission.
1445776	1446436	Right, and here's the thing.
1446456	1459149	It's not so much that I think Taito had a right to do it because of what is going on, but because people are so ignorant when they see this, they are going to think, oh, Taito or Space Invaders endorsed this, or this is a...
1460650	1472559	You know, all this ignorant crap that's out there in the media about video games that people like Jack Voldemort just perpetuate this whole thing.
1472980	1474861	So I understand why Taito's pissed.
1475021	1483027	And I think the guy made a bad judgment in that regard where maybe he should have done something similar yet different.
1483067	1483648	You know what I mean?
1484008	1487190	If he was going to invoke such emotion.
1487591	1488491	Parody is legal.
1489272	1490773	Parody is legal.
1491173	1494514	If we didn't have parody being legal, we would have no Jonathan Colton or Weird Al.
1494994	1495474	End of story.
1496194	1510079	But I also, I think that he should have been a little, especially as an artist, he should have recognized the difference between, you know, stealing somebody else's intellectual property and done something.
1510199	1511299	He could have used the concept.
1511339	1515261	I mean, how many video games do we have out there with, you know, aliens invading Earth's chute?
1516141	1517382	Die, Aliens, Bang Bang.
1517742	1520223	No, we've got a ton of games of those, so it wouldn't be any time of trouble.
1520243	1520823	Well, I'm offended.
1520883	1521704	You know why I'm offended?
1521724	1522844	Because I love aliens.
1522904	1524445	And aliens are creatures, too.
1524685	1528106	Aliens are creatures of the great god of the universe.
1528366	1533028	And I'm offended by these games where we just haphazardly kill aliens who only come in peace.
1533289	1536190	You want to hear something really ironic about this whole story?
1536470	1536670	What?
1536790	1538531	And that I'm sure that they didn't realize?
1540245	1548004	Next week on the Japanese WiiWare service Space Invaders Get Even will be released.
1549090	1551651	That is great.
1551811	1553771	The space invaders will destroy buildings.
1555211	1556552	It's like Rampage with aliens.
1556572	1557032	That's great.
1557052	1557512	But here's the thing.
1557692	1567454	I bet you there are tons of paintings out there that depict the events of 9-11, a horrific tragedy in American times in very controversial ways.
1567734	1571775	I bet there are tons of paintings out there and books and newspapers and movies.
1572816	1578477	But the funny thing is the media is never going to show that to you because they love to pick on video games.
1578897	1580058	That's why Taito's pissed.
1602071	1605013	Shaoran in chat says, I'm offended by games where you kill monsters.
1605073	1607234	I know plenty of monsters and they're not all like that.
1607554	1608855	It's an unfair stereotype.
1608995	1610095	I'm a monster activist.
1610135	1610756	Hear me roar.
1611796	1614597	Hey, look, we have a new segment on our show.
1614677	1617579	It's involving our new Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
1617859	1619800	And we invite you guys to respond to...
1620160	1620861	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1638453	1641695	Offensive, kind of, but there have been other stuff that have also done this.
1643176	1649919	See, for me, I respect what you're saying, dude, but 9-11 did happen.
1649939	1651820	That's just something we all kind of have to deal with.
1652080	1652601	You know what I mean?
1652661	1653021	I don't know.
1653561	1655982	It's a weird statement to me.
1656923	1659364	PodCulture says a bit too soon for stuff like that.
1659804	1659884	I'm 70!
1661972	1668734	Justin says, I think it was pretty tasteless and the guy was obviously going for press via controversy despite his insistence that he wasn't.
1669514	1672395	Alpha Cananogram says, I think that it was a risky move by the artist.
1672415	1675276	He must have known that he would piss people off, but he has the right to show it.
1675456	1675736	Yum.
1677056	1680617	DarkTetsuya says, I don't blame Taito for wanting to distance themselves from something so controversial.
1680677	1681677	Talk about bad PR.
1682037	1683258	Exactly what I'm saying, yo.
1683658	1689420	And Ranma, as a New Yorker that lives here and works two blocks from Ground Zero, it doesn't bother me, really.
1689520	1691060	Some people need to get their heads out of their asses.
1692432	1692852	There you go.
1693092	1695113	Comments from our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1695373	1712701	I just remember reading just how, you know, in fact, I honestly think that the biggest, you know, if people are so worried about, you know, recovery and about moving past it, then that's what they actually need to be doing, you know, recovering, moving past it, business as usual.
1712781	1714922	Kind of the ideas of people who laugh at funerals.
1716485	1719789	You know, because sometimes that's the best way to deal with it is to laugh at it.
1719869	1734869	And forgive me for being a little philosophical about this, but if their whole point of running airplanes into the buildings was to shake our morale and to weaken us, wouldn't the biggest slap in their face back would be to go back to business as usual?
1736417	1737317	We welcome your comments.
1737357	1740939	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have further comments on the issue.
1741659	1742020	All right.
1742840	1745441	And I'm sure there's a lot of people with very differing opinions on that.
1745741	1747622	Let's get to some more gaming news tonight, though.
1748062	1749843	And we're going to talk a lot about music games.
1750323	1754365	And, you know, this game will not be coming to Xbox Live, this whole Space Invaders controversial thing.
1755005	1755866	But guess what is?
1756326	1757047	Beat & Groovy Beat & Groovy
1777467	1782170	That's right, poppin' music looks like it is making its way to Xbox Live Arcade as beat and groovy.
1782650	1790855	But instead of having a pop music controller, because obviously you can't get one of those through Xbox Live Arcade, instead you will be hitting five different colored buttons.
1790895	1793677	They're all different colors, purple, blue, red, green, yellow.
1794157	1803322	You use left arrow, up arrow, right arrow or X, Y or B, I'm sorry, Y or A, and then B, or kind of like the different buttons.
1803983	1805844	I should buy my poppin' music controller.
1806004	1806525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1821021	1823183	DJ Taka, La La More, We Two Are One, Good Cool, Gotta Get My Groove On
1844119	1850760	of course, you would know these guys Orange Lounge with the 100 second kitchen battle also supposed to be in this Loki, what do you think?
1850820	1872684	I think it's retarded no, seriously they had an opportunity to bring over a game that some of the fans were looking for and what they tried to do the problem with Konami they're trying to bring on new people into their music games, I guess they're trying to appeal to different people
1874821	1879204	The problem is, these type of games are bought by a certain group of people.
1879444	1883427	And if you try to appeal to other people, they're not going to buy it.
1884348	1893514	And I heard a rumor that pretty much those songs that you see on there, those seven songs, I think there was two more, that's it.
1894275	1895856	Well, I'm sure there will be download things.
1895896	1897177	What if this is a testing round?
1897577	1897958	Could be.
1898898	1900640	It's stupid, though, because, I mean...
1901997	1902638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1919664	1920005	I don't know.
1920025	1921546	This isn't Rock Revolution.
1921566	1923527	It's like they don't know what they're doing.
1923707	1924488	Comments from chat.
1924988	1930452	Gsquared68 says, If it has Vic Viper as a character, maybe I might get a 360.
1932093	1937016	Our ever-faithful webmaster VXJSXV says, I can't believe they kept poppin' music songs in the song list.
1937316	1943700	I am kind of surprised that it's at least a bit of an authentic song list, all things considered, if this game is being targeted for the US as well.
1944161	1946042	Very interesting, but of course very cheap for them too.
1946402	1949084	And KatamarisForever says, Poppin' music should have more pop.
1949664	1950985	Avril Lavigne, Leona Lewis
1975603	1981405	Release it here and you also add songs that people that may not be used to poppin' music would like.
1981525	1988528	You know, like licensed songs or just songs that are really cool that kind of appeal that aren't necessarily poppin' music types of music.
1989589	1993430	Same should have been done with Rock Revolution.
1994111	1997712	They should have put some of the Bomani songs in there.
1998892	2002434	And yes, I understand that Bomani songs may not translate well
2002984	2003985	Thanks for watching!
2026199	2028441	Let me try reading a couple more comments from chat here.
2028481	2030582	Gerardimo has a very long comment here, but it's pretty good.
2030943	2038028	My problem right now is that people were bitching that Konami needed to Americanize their music games, but their hardcore fans got pissy because they wanted to keep in Konami songs.
2038288	2044753	So Konami is trying to appeal to American audience by making it less cute to appeal to Americans, but still rewarding their hardcore fans.
2045093	2048035	Now, yes, they took out the controller, but perhaps they're just trying to test it.
2048956	2051538	And then SSJ100Matt says, put ABBA in there.
2051818	2052638	Yeah, that'll work.
2052798	2053639	ABBA will make it all better.
2054260	2054640	Absolutely.
2056036	2058818	You know, again, I'm going to withhold judgment until I actually play the game.
2058918	2063060	I do think it might be a little bit of a water testing thing, but I don't know.
2063120	2068904	Let's just say I'm not getting my expectations very high, but I'd love to have Konami folks come on the show and talk about the game.
2069464	2070465	It could be very interesting.
2070865	2071826	So, we shall see.
2071986	2078570	Well, if you're looking for a seven-button controller, you remember that they are releasing a drum pad that has seven inputs on it.
2078590	2080291	Well, too bad this game only uses five.
2081109	2085732	Well, actually it uses 7 because you can use the two trigger buttons for the 7.
2086773	2087553	Whatever.
2087574	2088654	We'll see when it comes out.
2089935	2092217	Anyway, shall I continue?
2092337	2092537	Yes.
2093858	2099582	There is another peripheral that's going to be coming out for Guitar Hero 4, but Neversoft isn't saying what it is.
2101403	2110988	The speculation, though, is that it's either going to be some type of keyboard or a turntable because this is stated to work more specifically with the studio mode.
2111769	2113590	I kind of think of a mixing board.
2115691	2117191	I wouldn't be surprised to see a mixing board.
2117612	2118032	Interesting.
2118052	2123275	A lot of people have speculated keyboard because that's like the obvious thing, but that would be interesting, a mixing board, like Kraken DJ.
2124315	2124856	Wouldn't that be cool?
2124876	2126817	They do that and then they actually release Kraken DJ.
2126857	2127337	That would be sweet.
2128348	2129288	I don't know about that.
2130169	2131389	Wasn't Kraken DJ a Sega thing?
2131969	2132649	It was indeed.
2133570	2137031	Or perhaps they could stop releasing peripherals.
2138431	2141892	Seriously, four peripherals for this fucking game.
2142272	2147954	I mean, granted, it will probably be great, but seriously, it's a little overkill.
2149318	2154643	I know people are really enthusiastic about making their songs and stuff like that.
2154723	2159067	But they're totally in a penis envy war with Rock Band and all those folks right now.
2160349	2160869	Whatever.
2161269	2163111	They could try to get a jump on it, I guess.
2163692	2164913	Release all the peripherals you want.
2165013	2165814	I just won't buy them.
2167015	2168596	So, whatever.
2170078	2173982	Anyways, there's going to be some pretty cool stuff coming out for...
2175666	2179650	Dirty Little Secret by the All-American Rejects Crush Crush Crush by Paramore
2197799	2205842	The Takeover, The Breaks Over from Fall Out Boy, The Pretender from Foo Fighters, and Smashing Pumpkins with Tarantula.
2206443	2221669	And then they also have the 2000s with Linkin Park One Step Closer, Can't Stop by Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Middle with Jimmy Eat World, and I Can't Believe in Things Called Love by The Darkness, and many more.
2221809	2224630	So they're going to basically have different decades to go along with all this.
2225451	2225551	Um...
2226531	2230372	Pretty much the game is going to be exactly like Guitar Hero on tour.
2231092	2238554	They've just kind of tweaked a few things including before where they'd have you sign autographs and sign different things.
2238574	2242715	You're signing wristbands and stuff like that.
2243315	2243655	I don't know.
2243815	2245576	It's more of the same, just different track list.
2247096	2248236	Much like all the music games.
2248256	2249977	Much like all the other Guitar Hero games have been lately.
2251177	2255718	That's why they need to add new peripherals because they're starting to just feel like the same damn game over and over again.
2256229	2257410	Yeah, that's what it is, I don't know.
2257430	2268556	You know, this isn't a show role, but I heard rumors also that, or I should say I read rumors, that they were talking about doing yet another peripheral for a Tony Hawk game on the DS.
2270357	2272399	Seriously, stop making... On the DS?
2272599	2273199	On the DS.
2273419	2274280	Like a fingerboard?
2275100	2280784	Possibly a fingerboard, or possibly... They were suggesting that maybe it's like...
2282099	2288822	There was that mag game that they had where you basically would slide the DS around, kind of like a motion sensor almost.
2288842	2289502	Interesting.
2289542	2289882	I don't know.
2290002	2291243	It's still retarded, though.
2291543	2295225	Stop releasing games with peripherals.
2295245	2297526	Do you guys remember those fingerboards from back in the day?
2297566	2303328	Like when I was in high school, they actually had those little things on keychains, and you actually used your fingers to move this little thing around.
2303408	2305609	You did little tricks, like they had little miniature ramps.
2305909	2307530	I remember you having one of those.
2308459	2309119	DDRonlineCommunity.com
2335999	2336679	Dance Dance Revolution X
2361230	2366692	Brand new remixes, 2008 X-edits of Butterfly and Dubby Dub.
2367272	2368832	Remember Dubby Dub?
2368872	2369652	You probably know this.
2369752	2373654	So they're basically just recutting the song.
2373834	2374874	It doesn't look like a remix.
2374894	2376674	They're just taking a different portion.
2376754	2382656	Well, it says, enjoy the familiar, impossible-to-resist melody while exploring the fresh new arrangement.
2383336	2385617	It's been reworked exclusively for DDRX.
2386357	2387738	Black and White by Michael Jackson Tootsie Roll
2415984	2416684	That song's awesome.
2417085	2420806	I Want Candy, Bust a Move, Obsession.
2420866	2421827	I thought that was kind of interesting.
2421867	2424928	The old synth pop song you still hear at goth clubs until today.
2425589	2426309	Call on Me.
2427029	2428630	But this one I thought was most interesting.
2429010	2431272	Nelly Furtado's All Good Things Come to an End.
2431652	2433373	They've remade that as a dance classic.
2433393	2436794	But then again, if they can do that to Lips of an Angel, why not do it to that song too?
2436814	2440736	That's DDR Hottest Party 2 coming to the Nintendo Wii a little later this year.
2440756	2442797	There was one of those tracks on DDRX.
2444458	2446821	I'm not going to say what it was, number four.
2448262	2449163	That song was awesome.
2450004	2453047	It's an awesome remix of another song from DDR.
2453288	2455630	Also, I was going to mention, though, this is a cool title for a song.
2457092	2461236	The 30 Lives Up Up Down Dance Mix.
2461957	2462497	That's awesome.
2462998	2465000	That is a pretty good name for a dinner song.
2465721	2465921	Yeah.
2466755	2478191	ddronlinecommunity.com if you want to see a list of songs coming to your DDR games later this year and I'm sure it's just a matter of time before we start talking about Universe 3 and who knows what else in the DDR franchise on into 2009
2480407	2481288	Samba de Amigo Samba de Amigo
2499611	2502573	But the other good thing about it is that they're actually talking about download content.
2502994	2503274	Cool.
2503854	2511359	So with that, the Wii exclusive track list, if you are ready for this.
2513201	2513521	Sure.
2514181	2517364	We have Byla Mae by Gypsy Kings, and I love Gypsy Kings.
2518084	2519765	They do a really good cover of Hotel California.
2520686	2523428	Papa Loves Mambo, Mambo No.
2523448	2523828	8, sorry.
2524709	2528151	Konga, Miami Style Machine, Lowrider, Mambo No. 5...
2530447	2532309	Oye Como Va by Santana
2546604	2563433	There are some previously returning tracks like Tub Thumping, The Cup of Life, Samba de Janeiro, Bomboleo, Take on Me, the Real Big Fish version, Tequila, Soul Bossa Nova.
2564414	2569437	Downloadable tracks are Mambo Mambo and I Want Candy and Are You Going to Be My Girl.
2570597	2575862	That's cool that some of the songs from the old school Samba de Migo are coming back, like the Real Big Fish take on me.
2575922	2578484	I seem to remember that was in the Dreamcast.
2578504	2579785	That was a download song on the Dreamcast.
2580066	2581947	Although they weren't really downloads.
2582027	2583148	They were pay to unlock.
2583168	2583989	Well, no, they weren't pay.
2584009	2584950	You didn't have to pay back then.
2585010	2587472	They were just download to unlock.
2587832	2591936	Which, though, that does give me this bad feeling, especially because we're talking about the Wii here.
2591996	2594698	Is this going to be pay to unlock content?
2594718	2597120	It's supposedly not pay to unlock content.
2597180	2597741	Oh, that would be good.
2598141	2619427	Now, this is what's cool, is the Maracas controller are going to be that bright hot red, you know, and that you slip your, of course, one of them has a nunchuck attachment inside, and the other one is for your Wiimote attachment, and I'll be putting a picture of this up on the chat room.
2621536	2626397	And everybody say a big thank you to Sega for giving us the Maracas controller so this game feels right.
2626757	2628438	Thank you, Sega.
2628458	2629278	It wasn't Sega.
2629298	2631858	I don't think they're licensed.
2631898	2634919	They're not licensed by Nintendo or something.
2637119	2639860	Well, still, somebody got it out there one way or another.
2639880	2641380	I hope they make the little shaky shake noise.
2642340	2642900	I think they do.
2643400	2643740	Awesome.
2645481	2646881	And this game better still make you pose.
2648393	2649734	Posing is the best part.
2650075	2650655	But you know what?
2650675	2651997	We still need the tambourine game.
2672179	2673580	at Penny Arcade Expo next week.
2673600	2674780	That's the one question I want to ask.
2674821	2675781	Where's the tambourine game?
2677302	2678202	I talked to Sega.
2679043	2681484	We went to the tambourine game.
2681524	2683946	Well, let's all bug them.
2683966	2691470	I got to say, because we had our games conference at work not last week, but the week before last.
2693151	2697813	And I got to say, Sega's lineup is probably one of the coolest lineups I've seen.
2697873	2699234	They actually kind of get it.
2700205	2701326	Which is surprising.
2702066	2704828	Is that because there's been a couple years where they have not been getting it?
2705148	2706669	I guess.
2707210	2708811	It's not just Sonic stuff.
2708831	2710672	They're putting out stuff.
2710692	2712493	They're taking risks, I guess.
2713314	2719058	With Mad World, the House of Dead game that's coming out and stuff like that.
2719338	2720599	Everybody's got to be picky in chat.
2720679	2725002	SSJ100Matt says, I will not say thank you to Sega until Shenmue 3 comes out.
2727475	2733691	Don't hold your breath I want it to come out too, but don't hold your breath
2734669	2738731	Actdeft calls what happened this week at your work the Loki Zig Games Convention.
2739331	2740771	Yeah, it wasn't very exciting.
2741391	2743672	I got to see people act like idiots, so that was fun.
2744232	2745713	Alright, how about some release dates, Loki?
2745733	2748154	Let's travel the world and look at release dates from around the world.
2748354	2751795	Alright, this week we've got quite a bit of stuff coming out, actually.
2752395	2752935	Some good stuff.
2753596	2757317	Starting off, we've got Commando Steel Disaster on the DS.
2757397	2760118	Now, this game might not sound familiar to you guys, but...
2760738	2763980	It plays exactly like Metal Slug.
2764220	2765941	And it looks kind of like Metal Slug.
2766461	2772164	So definitely check it out if you're into the fast shooter games like Contra, Metal Slug.
2773905	2774626	Worth checking out.
2774806	2777007	So that's on the DS.
2777587	2779268	Also on the DS, MLB Power Pros 2008.
2780809	2782650	Konami's super deformed baseball game.
2784311	2789074	Nintendo, not to be outdone by Konami, is putting out Mario Super Sluggers on the Wii.
2790700	2792201	Funnel Family Baseball Game.

2846530	2855475	GTR Evolution on the PC, Pajama Sam, Don't Fear the Dark on the Wii, and Freddy Fish in the Kelp Seed Mystery on the Wii.
2856435	2858656	and Spy Fox and Dry... That sounds like fun.
2858737	2860277	Freddy Fish and the Kelp Mystery.
2860978	2864080	And Spy Fox and Dry Cereal on the Wii.
2864800	2867261	All of which are meant for little kids.

2869202	2871024	Spy Fox and Dry Cereal.
2873465	2873785	Nice.

2877447	2878708	Some guy kidnapped the milk.
2879611	2881012	Let's travel the world.
2881032	2881332	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2881372	2881813	I'm not done yet.
2881973	2882233	Oh, okay.
2882253	2882473	I'm sorry.
2882493	2882773	I'm sorry.
2882813	2883214	Sheesh.

2909943	2931833	Penumbra Requiem on PC, Prison Tycoon 4 Super Max on PC, The Sims Apartment Life on DS and PC I think that's only on the PC because the DS is something different and let's see Garfield Fun Fest on the DS, Sid Meier's Pirates on the Mac Sounds like fun

2958311	2963316	FlatOut, Ultimate Carnage on PC, and Operation Mania on PC.
2963856	2966579	Do you think Tales of Vesperia will be as big here as it was over in Japan?
2966599	2969481	Because I don't know if you've heard, but it's been selling like crazy over in Japan.
2969501	2971463	It's been pushing 360 units out the door.
2971783	2972744	I know, that's crazy.
2972824	2975287	That's one of the big stories we missed by not being here last week.
2975387	2979450	No, I don't think it's going to do as well because Infinite of Discovery is coming out next week.
2979711	2980091	Oh, snap.
2981630	2982391	DJ Ranma S,

3010122	3012524	Moving over to Japan, if I can.
3013244	3018548	And talking about the release dates over there on the Xbox 360, Two Human finally makes its way to Japan on August 28th.
3018628	3022590	Also coming out, Clonod is coming out in Japan on the Xbox 360.
3022830	3026813	This is not to be confused with the Irish music group that you might think.
3026853	3028694	I think Enya's sister is in Clonod.
3029234	3029414	Yes.
3029514	3030755	Because Enya was once in the band.
3031155	3033477	Clonod is also a Japanese manga.

3075519	3076079	Oh, yeah.
3076139	3077179	Captain Rainbow.
3077219	3078959	You need to import that shit, Loki.
3078979	3079780	Get that game instead.
3079800	3080520	I will be importing that shit.

3137888	3138249	I don't know.
3138289	3139869	I'm looking at the more details on this game.
3139889	3142471	Rei is the character I hate, Ayanami.
3142711	3143711	I'm not able to pull up more details.
3143731	3145272	And Asuka's the awesome one that speaks German.
3146803	3148925	There you have it, another DS game coming out there.

3213002	3217902	Alright, and we've got some quick mentions with more release dates.
3218082	3222423	Not stuff coming out soon, but soon enough, I guess.
3223603	3233705	Among other things, Fallout 3 was announced this week that it will be coming out on October 28th on PlayStation 3 and on the Xbox 360 as well as the Special Edition.
3234325	3238106	And that should be as big as Oblivion, if not bigger.
3239186	3244548	This week on Hot Shots Golf, there was Kratos download content.
3244588	3255093	You can actually play as the God of War using the Clubs of Chaos in the golf game.

3262897	3264178	SILENT HILL HOMECOMING
3285603	3314704	barely in September I think it's on the 30th if I remember correctly and then Nintendo there's some Nintendo stuff announced or maybe not announced Wii Music slated for October 27th I can't imagine that's a really good date to release that but more power to them I guess Pokemon Ranger Shadows of Almia on the 10th of November and Animal Crossing City Folk
3315692	3316353	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3331559	3334581	It will not be coming with the WeSpeak microphone.
3334641	3336623	You will have to buy that separately.
3337103	3339905	And the microphone will cost you $29.99.
3340705	3342447	Is that a secret?
3342547	3343307	I have not heard that.
3343387	3344728	This is like the first time I'm hearing this.
3345389	3347750	Well, that's because no one knows about it yet.
3348190	3349051	Interesting.
3349131	3349591	Alright.
3350932	3351513	Well, that's too bad.
3352053	3356556	From a retail standpoint, that's good because then there won't be shortages on the game.
3356836	3357777	I guess that's true.
3358938	3359078	Yeah.
3360007	3362560	Alright, well, thanks for the updates, Loki.
3365328	3367989	Alpha Cananagram says it was already known, I think.
3368610	3369090	So who knows?
3370551	3374393	Well, here's one game that people are definitely anticipating, Final Fantasy XIII.
3374433	3376694	And the question is, when is the demo coming?
3376734	3377735	When is the demo coming?
3377795	3379776	And you might have heard that there is a demo coming.
3379816	3381017	I think we talked about it a couple weeks ago.
3381517	3386800	It's coming with the Final Fantasy Advent Children Blu-ray release, the complete version, which has the extra footage.
3387120	3388101	Well, here's the interesting thing.
3388161	3390462	It's being reported by IGN.
3390962	3403147	That apparently in Famitsu PS3 edition, apparently the director of Final Fantasy XIII, Motomo Toriyama, has said that it's going to be a two-hour demo.
3403928	3405689	So that's a heck of a lot of demo.
3406149	3410651	He says, quote, like the Final Fantasy VII demo that was included with PlayStation's ToeBall number one.
3410991	3411751	It will be similar to that.
3412171	3415413	It will allow folks to experience the opening sequence and prologue.
3415973	3416473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3441167	3444070	I'm very curious to see what this demo looks like.
3444391	3448335	I'm not surprised they're saying it's two hours, but I still think there's people that are going to blast right through it.
3448635	3453120	But it's probably one of those things where there might be a lot of hidden depth to it, and you can milk two hours out of it.
3453420	3455382	But I imagine most people will burn through it in an hour.
3456394	3457555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3476138	3500207	well for people who are fans of Street Fighter 4 that is actually I do believe just recently had a console version announced there is going to be Cammy in the game so she will be included in the console release of Street Fighter 4 and that makes people happy because they like to see her butt crack who doesn't?
3501127	3505389	um no answer alright um
3506909	3508791	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3526743	3532286	I don't understand where the mouse input is coming from because I don't see any sort of touchpad or anything.
3532626	3537009	Unless they're having you rub your fingers over the letters, I don't know.
3539050	3541172	It's kind of interesting, kind of cool.
3541672	3548596	It snaps to the joystick much like, I don't know, the chatpad.
3549177	3553720	But this time, instead of being below the actual controller, it's above it.
3553940	3554140	So...
3556481	3567670	And other things that it will feature, quick keys for your friends lists and for your messages as well as the ability to type and all that fun stuff.
3568751	3572494	Very interesting that the PS3 has been compared a lot of times to a computer.
3573499	3575220	ActDeft in chat says, Sony, we don't innovate, we imitate.
3575260	3579562	I always thought that was kind of Microsoft's thing, is that, you know, anything you can do, I can do better.
3579603	3580043	Remember that?
3580083	3580803	But that's innovating.
3603843	3605705	I guess that's true when you make it better.
3605965	3607807	Yeah, Sony has been playing a lot of catch-up, though.
3608467	3609108	But I don't know.
3609148	3610770	This mouse thing is kind of neat, I guess.
3612271	3613052	Now, this is good, though.
3613973	3616255	What better on the PlayStation 3 than something free?
3616975	3617996	And we like free things.
3618016	3620298	The only bad news for us is that it's happening in Europe.
3621059	3623360	Oh well, we still have some friends overseas that listen to our show.
3623440	3623740	Guess what?
3623760	3625721	You guys are getting something called VidZone.
3626342	3629263	It's something for the PS3 that involves music videos.
3629323	3632585	It's a streaming music video service that's going to be launching on the PlayStation 3.
3632645	3636006	The trial of this whole thing is supposed to be starting in early 2009.
3636066	3639588	It's going to be taking place in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
3641889	3647051	Vidzone will include a full playlist of videos from hip-hop to punk, heavy metal, and classics.
3647571	3649852	And you'll actually be able to build your own playlist.
3649872	3655734	You can download songs and music videos and ringtones, but some of that might actually end up costing you.
3656074	3665197	So while I guess it'll probably be free to maybe watch some of the videos on demand and stuff, if you actually want to take away the ringtones or download the songs, that's going to cost you a little bit of money.
3665557	3667418	By the way, though, now this is kind of cool.
3668218	3696550	it will do the whole remote play thing so if you download a music video you can put it on your PSP so like if there's a music video that you just like have to have with you on the go you can do that so you know that's and that's one of Sony's strengths right now is that they've built a really good relationship between the PS3 and the PSP for those that own both so that that does sound kind of cool I got to admit I mean how neat would it be to see say you know oh there's this great new song oh wait you haven't heard it oh here I got it on my PSP you know kind of neat
3697133	3698834	So props to them for that, really.
3699954	3700574	I can do that.
3700694	3701375	I have an iPhone.
3702815	3703316	Touche.
3704396	3713380	Well, this has just been exactly like you said, a music-loaded, you know... It really has.
3713400	3720022	It's a music-filled show tonight, and it's not just because we love music games based on our history, but it really has been dominating the news this week.
3720323	3724664	But consider how much music games are selling these days between Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and all that.
3724944	3725805	It's big business now.
3726570	3727571	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3744611	3755078	There are over 2.2 million SingStar songs were downloaded from the Sing Store that launched about a year ago.
3756259	3762763	So now there's actually new plans for a Disney version for PS2 that's all Disney songs.
3764807	3769512	There was a rumor about this a while back and I called bullshit on it because I thought Disney would do it themselves.
3769713	3771595	They are doing it themselves.
3772736	3773296	Well, there's more.
3773497	3773977	Okay, go ahead.
3773997	3774177	Sorry.
3774898	3778142	It's exclusively for PAL territories.
3779750	3785796	Exactly, because in the North American territories, and possibly Japan, I don't know.
3785836	3796407	But it's compatible with the SingStar PS3, and of course if you have an HD TV, it won't matter if it's PAL or not.
3796768	3799010	Loki, it's not just because SingStar performs better in Europe?
3799611	3799811	Yeah.
3800480	3803263	It does perform better in Europe, but in the U.S.
3804203	3816874	or North America, I should say, they are releasing Disney Sing It, which is basically like SingStar, but it's all the Disney songs and their kind of version of a karaoke game.
3817432	3819013	I actually like SingStar better than Karaoke Revolution.
3832410	3833872	I have really high hopes for Lips.
3833892	3835894	I think it's going to take what's great from both games.
3848408	3848728	Honestly.
3848908	3863735	Well, what's kind of cool also, I was going to say, there's another announcement that they're going to do a patch for SingStar PS3 where you can use your PlayStation 2 discs to import songs from that as well, like you can with the PlayStation 2 version.
3864055	3864315	Good.
3864515	3865355	I think that's a great idea.
3866096	3866476	Good for them.
3869656	3879543	Something else that's kind of neat, and I was reading in the chatroom, well actually that was for Africa, but no more games are going to get added onto the bet.
3880124	3881985	So you can forget about it.
3882025	3886669	And this is another game that will not be added onto the bet, but it also uses the PlayStation Eye.
3887310	3888390	It's Eye Pet.
3889091	3894075	It's basically a game where you prod what looks to be a little monkey creature.
3895439	3897540	And to be honest, it is very cute looking.
3899601	3907043	And if I didn't have a TV that was, you know, kind of a, with a plastic screen, you know, an LCD TV, I would let my cat play with this.
3909344	3912245	But, yeah, so it's a virtual pet.
3913446	3914146	And you get to poke it.
3915327	3915947	And it's coming out in 2009.
3918084	3920525	Oh goody, just what the world needs.
3920906	3921946	And they'll probably have pets.
3922106	3929690	They'll probably have, well this is kind of cool because you can pick it up and stuff or pretend to pick it up and throw it around.
3931351	3935974	Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the end of Part A in the Classic Game of the Week.
3936535	3938236	And it's more music games.
3938296	3939857	I mean, we just had a lot to talk about tonight.
3939877	3942419	And the question is, what's Harmonix gonna do next?
3942499	3945361	I mean, you know, they've obviously had mega success with Rock Band.
3946461	3954147	The rumor is that apparently Harmonix is dealing in the new game that has to do with music creation.
3954587	3959850	It's something that their PR rep John Drake said talking to MTV's multiplayer blog.
3960851	3962712	We've done the whole MIDI creation thing.
3962992	3969094	We think we can do something really ambitious and really great that's going to speak across all the users of the game, not just hardcore users.
3969374	3972735	And that will result in some awesome stuff and not just Final Fantasy covers.
3973255	3978076	So interesting that Harmonix might get into a little more of the creation.
3978576	3980837	You know, Harmonix has put out a lot of solid products.
3980917	3983898	I assume if they're going to go this way, it's going to be some pretty good stuff.
3984438	3989680	I look forward to the next project and I hope it's just not, you know, Rock Band 3, Rock Band 4, Rock Band 5.
3990000	3990440	You know what I mean?
3990942	3994145	I'm looking forward to new original things they come out with.
3994505	3995125	Wouldn't you agree?
3996206	3997087	Yes.
3997647	3998828	Sorry, I had mine.
3999349	3999669	What, Loki?
3999829	4002171	I was going to say, kind of going back to the last story we had.
4004028	4006169	I was checking out the trailer for that iPad.
4006189	4008290	It actually looks really cute, actually.
4008390	4010351	I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by it.
4011191	4013532	I'm surprised to hearing you describing a game as cute.
4013612	4014572	What makes it so cute?
4015073	4017534	Well, the creature is incredibly fuzzy and cute.
4018274	4020495	It kind of looks like a little miniature monkey Simba.
4021095	4026137	Anyways, what's kind of neat, though, is some of the technology that they're using with it.
4026157	4027318	You can draw your pet.
4028240	4028620	Toys.
4029041	4032384	So basically you draw a little car and it becomes a car.
4032824	4036868	It's kind of like some of those tech demos they were showing off using the PlayStation Eye.
4037608	4039410	That's the kind of thing with the PlayStation Eye.
4039670	4045355	They're actually doing some really cool things with it unlike the Eye toy which is just a lot of crap.
4045976	4049218	So I'm kind of excited to see what they're going to do with this.
4049299	4054103	And I may actually have to pick up this game just because my cat would love playing with this thing.
4056581	4060363	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4087301	4088801	What should the kids be playing this week?
4089602	4096563	The game of the week is Jet Set Radio, which is one of my all-time favorite games.
4097844	4099264	Let's have some music, shall we, Rob?
4099684	4100244	Working on it.
4100444	4100704	Okay.
4101545	4114048	Well, at any rate, Jet Set Radio is a game where you start off as this guy named Beat, who is a runaway who got shoved from gang to gang until he decided to make one of his own, and they basically just go around tagging shit.
4115109	4119513	That's really the purpose of the game, is to tag stuff and wipe out your opposition.
4119533	4121915	And it's got some good music in it.
4123476	4126519	We've got some Guitar Vader, which I like Guitar Vader.
4127620	4137369	In the US version, there was a track by Mix Master Mike, and by, actually Dragula was in it, Rob Zombie.
4138991	4149063	And there were a few that were only in the PAL release, too, such as, let's see, some of the groups was Semi-Detached and Jurassic 5.
4149123	4155170	The Japanese version, there was one by David Soule.
4155511	4157573	So each release had its own stuff.
4157593	4158434	Let's play some music.
4160692	4168259	Just set a bomb in the city, get close to it and it'll go beep, and then boom!
4171994	4173876	This game really was a lot of fun.
4174016	4175717	I really enjoyed this game on the Dreamcast.
4176318	4187909	Well, at any rate, the way that you go through the game is that you've got basically rollerblades, and you pick up different people in the game to bring them into your own little gang of Rudies, they're called.
4189750	4194295	The main guy, Beat, is very all-around even.
4194495	4195476	He's very balanced.
4195936	4197077	But you get another guy later.
4197277	4198157	I don't remember his name.
4198177	4200559	He's the guy who had the big boombox.
4200619	4203280	He was really slow and really tough.
4204021	4206502	So you could use him for like endurance.
4207242	4211205	But as the game goes through, you know, the police come after you and you have to knock them over.
4212405	4230197	and you can actually tag the head detective who comes after you um but in later stages like they send out helicopters to shoot you down and all kinds of stuff it's crazy and then the last level is you're fighting this guy on top of a giant record album who's trying to use the album to summon a demon but and I won't ruin that for anybody
4231434	4235017	But there were other releases after this first one came out.
4236678	4246626	By the way, the Jet Set Radio thing is actually this Professor K is a DJ in a pirate radio station in the city of Tokyo-cho.
4247547	4260457	There's also different areas in the game that represent a different time of day, like Shibuya-cho is daytime, Benten-cho is nighttime, and Kogane-cho is like a residential area at sunset.
4260737	4262058	That's pretty cool.
4263758	4265439	But you've also got your rival gangs in there.
4265539	4271782	There is the Poison Jam that wear fish costumes.
4271802	4272682	They're kind of stupid.
4272722	4274963	The Noise Tanks are cyborg types.
4275503	4282086	And Love Shockers are a girl game that look like the emo rangers, which I thought was funny.
4282106	4283867	And then you have to fight the golden rhinos later.
4284888	4296537	The other versions that I was talking about is there was Adjusted Radio Future that came out on Xbox and we got it in America as JSRF, Adjusted Radio Future.
4297418	4298619	It came out in Europe too.
4299480	4300240	Basically it was...
4301281	4304045	Just a bit more touched up, you know, had different music.
4305567	4311834	Just That Radio came out on Game Boy Advance that was from an isometric perspective.
4311914	4314678	It was alright, you know, it was cute.
4314758	4315819	Then there was actually...
4318382	4330269	One that was actually released called De La Jet Set Radio, which was the deluxe version that was only in Japan via Dreamcast Direct.
4330649	4332050	It later came out as Sega Direct.
4333411	4337413	So it's really hard to get a hold of, but you actually...
4338914	4339834	Thank you for watching!
4362384	4363164	Bastards!
4363705	4364865	That would be so great!
4365226	4371329	Or especially with all the Dreamcast love we've seen on Xbox Live Arcade lately, what with Soul Calibur and some of these games.
4371769	4377292	I would love to see Jet Set Radio kind of take a new form on Xbox Live Arcade or something, you know what I mean?
4377752	4379293	Don't let this franchise rot away.
4381098	4389181	Well, the other thing that I also didn't mention is that, as much as I hate the name, we did get our first release in America as Jet Grind Radio.
4389821	4391282	So, I don't know why.
4391322	4394603	I think maybe someone else had licensed Jet Set Radio or something.
4395363	4398524	But it's stupid, so now they fixed it for later versions.
4399725	4399905	So...
4402364	4405446	Alright, well there you have it, your classic game of the week.
4406086	4409048	Jet Set Radio, or Jet Grind Radio, whatever you prefer.
4409708	4412289	Just go do some graffiti, but not in real life.
4412870	4413730	Strictly for the games.
4413750	4416011	Oh, the other thing about that, you actually had a graffiti editor.
4416912	4418092	That's right, I remember that.
4418313	4418733	That's right.
4420705	4422167	See, that's why they need that.
4422187	4427234	Imagine, with download content and everything, we could have OLR gang signs that you could use as graffiti.
4427694	4428476	Alright, there you have it.
4428556	4431519	A very excellent classic game of the week.
4431840	4432961	True, true classic there.
4433422	4435224	Alright, we are going to take a break, but...
4435765	4436365	We'll see you next time.
4457234	4460357	Just a quick couple of songs and then some free break.
4460477	4464000	And we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio Part B. Lots of stuff to come.
4464360	4468083	Rumors abound about the 360 and this apparent price drop that's coming.
4468644	4473748	And if Microsoft's going to be taking some cues from Nintendo and what have you.
4473788	4476890	And then, by the way, something a lot of our listeners call in to talk about.
4477551	4478011	Canned.
4478612	4479633	Not happening this year.
4479653	4484737	We're going to talk about all that in Part B when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

4550512	4553574	Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts from OLR here.
4554094	4557936	You know, I hate it when people come up to me and tell me I just lost the game.
4558557	4560798	I can't help but think to myself, what game?
4561178	4566021	I'm not playing any video games right this second, or I don't remember signing up to play Monopoly.
4566581	4570924	Apparently it's some stupid internet joke where if I think about the game, I lose the game.
4571584	4576708	You know, next time some kid tells me I just lost the game, I'm gonna tell them that they just lost their balance.
4577189	4579291	Then when they look at me like a puppy dog and say, what?
4579571	4580672	I'll kick them in the shin.
4581012	4582073	Then I'll point and laugh.
4582413	4584615	Because I'm not playing your fucking stupid game.
4592842	4595064	Can't make it to this year's Penny Arcade Expo?

4614700	4620766	You know, I haven't run into a ninja in the Burning Sea, but if they mythically did exist, I suspect they would take away five durability.
4620846	4621567	Oh, they do exist.

4712802	4714162	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4739387	4766738	as well as participating in the Penny Arcade coverage that you heard there during the free break on allgames.com and that's available if you want more information on that pax.allgames.com has all the information you need to know about that and by the way I love that ad I love the fact that they have a guy in a radio voice going and joining them is Super Happy Funtime Show some of those other awesomely named podcasts that we're going to be attending with alright
4767578	4768979	Let's get back into some gaming news.
4769280	4772323	Loki, what's this about the price drop?
4772363	4772983	Is it happening?
4774004	4774925	Probably.
4775085	4780150	Where there's smoke, there's fire, and there's Xbox 360 price drops.
4781251	4792842	Well, you remember back a few weeks ago that there was a rumor that the Xbox 360 would be dropping in price on all three SKUs, including the recently introduced 60GB Pro system.
4793902	4799526	Well, if the rumor is true, then on September 7th, the arcade will be dropping to $199.
4800406	4806630	The pro system, the 60 gig, will be dropping to $299 and the elite to $399.
4807090	4811092	And there's a little bit more proof that it will probably happen because guess what?
4811132	4817356	Just like all those other price drops that have ever happened, there have been some ads leaked.
4818116	4820718	And wouldn't you know it, Radio Shack is listing...
4821607	4830171	The Elite for $3.99, and the Arcade for $1.99, and the ad says it's good starting September 7th.
4830471	4833172	Damn you, Radio Shack, for ruining it all.
4833592	4840155	So, you know, sure we could go and say that this is all rumor and stuff, but come on.
4841115	4843136	I mean, I'm not going to insult your intelligence.
4843196	4845377	Of course there's going to be a fucking price drop happening.
4846297	4847278	Thanks for watching!
4860677	4866102	Do you think maybe next time they should take a different approach and not tell retailers until the day they're ready to do it?
4866342	4866862	They can't.
4867022	4870565	They can't because they have to set up their advertising that way and co-op and stuff.
4870946	4876390	So there's really no way to do it other than punish the people leaking the stuff out.
4877711	4878952	It's too hard though.
4878972	4879633	It could be anybody.
4880734	4884998	It's probably a small list of people, but I don't know.
4885777	4889678	I think what's interesting though is you've got a few things happening.
4904225	4912610	and it's priced the same as the soon-to-be-introduced 80GB core system from Sony's PS3 line there.
4913430	4923716	And also the arcade system, which there's some info on that too coming later, priced lower than the Wii.
4924676	4926417	I mean, that's kind of interesting right there.
4926437	4927518	That's very interesting.
4927538	4931020	If there are Wii shortages during the holiday, people might go, hey,
4932131	4932311	Buy a 360.
4932692	4933774	It's cheaper.
4934114	4935696	That's probably exactly what they want people to do.
4935716	4936658	Cheaper and easier to find.
4936698	4937579	More games out there.
4938641	4940664	And now they've got family-friendly titles.
4941104	4947694	They're really pulling out some good game plan.
4947714	4948495	That's all I've got to say.
4949301	4951782	Alright, well, I'm looking at comments in chat here.
4952263	4955945	Joshi16 says, I may buy an arcade just so I can put an Xbox in another room.
4957425	4960787	Let's see, Ranma says, hey Sony, 360 is getting a price drop.
4960827	4962388	Do the same for PS3, you fuckers.
4964589	4967671	DarkTesturious says, my brother keeps bugging me about when's the PS3 coming down.
4968531	4973074	And IkumaJP, our good friend from Japan, agrees with Loki.
4973174	4975195	You know, they can't advertise this stuff in advance.
4975895	4978457	But he does say, every time a leak happens, kittens get killed.
4980267	4981008	You know the old saying.
4981448	4986953	Alright, anyhow, you know, Loki mentioned where there's smoke, there's fire, but could there be a freaking nuclear bomb?
4988354	4994880	I don't know about this one, but apparently, you know, the arcade skew, you know, coming down to $199 based on what Loki said, here it comes again.
4995160	5001305	Rumors that there is a motion controller coming with that Xbox 360 arcade this holiday.
5001626	5006150	Apparently this new arcade system, now this, again, this may not necessarily be the one that comes on September 7th,
5006990	5013233	I would think if it is, we would have heard about it a long time ago, but possibly one that's coming later on by the holidays.
5013813	5022297	It says that it's going to come with a 512MB memory card, and the new Xbox experience is already there on the system, so you don't even have to get online to get it.
5022878	5029721	And a motion controller is supposed to be coming with it, along with some compatible minigames that have been developed by Rare.
5030601	5031962	Now, here's where it gets weird.
5032042	5037505	Apparently, this controller is also supposed to be sold separately with even more minigames by Rare.
5038666	5039687	So, I don't know.
5039787	5044409	The controller, though, is supposedly going to work with any Xbox 360 that's already out there.
5044449	5047451	So, it's not like you have to get a new Xbox just to have this motion controller.
5048632	5049052	I don't know.
5049593	5050333	Fact or crap?
5050873	5051554	I say it's crap.
5052895	5054756	This time.
5054976	5058218	If it actually does happen, it will have to happen by...
5059670	5060170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5084862	5095210	I don't think so because if they were going to release, if they were going to try to clear off the shelves of arcade units they would have dropped it down to $199 and this would come out at $239 or whatever.
5096491	5105678	What's going to happen though is it does have to come out by the end of October because the end of October is when the new Scenic game comes out and it has Avatar support already built in.
5106039	5108581	So the new firmware update is coming out before that.
5109261	5114706	And if this firmware update is being included on the actual console, it has to come out before the end of October.
5114766	5120111	But still, Loki, they're not going to do two SKU things back-to-back like that.
5120532	5130141	They're going to do this because including the 512MB memory unit makes it on par with Nintendo's system, and it's cheaper, and it has motion-controlled stuff.
5131394	5133295	DarkSakura, any interest in motion control on 360 at all?
5133315	5133635	Not really.
5133655	5134015	I hated it on PS3.
5160566	5163290	Oh, with the whole six axis, oh true, we always forget about that.
5163590	5175206	And honestly, I don't really play that many Wii games, you know, I don't really enjoy them as much using the controller that way, so I'm not excited.
5175697	5177278	Alright, well, we'll see what happens.
5177878	5181860	Actdeft in chat says, If Microsoft's smart, they will make the arcade have the 20 gigabyte drive.
5183020	5183280	I don't know.
5183320	5185001	As long as they can keep selling that separately, why not?
5185521	5188842	But then again, it makes a lot of sense because Microsoft's trying to do a lot more digital distribution.
5189222	5189543	I don't know.
5189803	5190063	We'll see.
5191018	5206048	Well, speaking of other Microsoft stuff, there was, at the Leipzig convention, a controller that was almost identical except for being kind of a pukey green color that had a corrected D-pad.
5206068	5218056	It was supposed to be a lot more easy to use, better control on it, and it was supposed to be coming out along with Pro Evolution Soccer 2009.
5221538	5238870	people were pretty excited about it except that it was stated to be a limited edition promotional item that is going to be out on October 24th however it's as long as supplies last and only available in Europe, Asia, and Latin America
5239395	5240436	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5254574	5255614	Fix it across the board!
5282409	5297441	and then they'll probably just tweak the whole controller because there's no reason to make an entirely different mold and you know circuit board setup or whatever they have to do for you know the Xbox 360 controller fix the problem and just say okay we're done no more fixing you know
5298593	5299534	They're just gonna fix it.
5300014	5300315	Period.
5300555	5301156	I hope you're right.
5301216	5311546	I would love... You know, although I kind of resent the fact I'm gonna have to buy a whole new Xbox 360 controller to fix what was essentially their crappy D-pad, but I'll do it because, I mean, I don't know how you guys feel.
5311766	5313908	I hate that D-pad on the Xbox.
5313948	5315910	I mean, it really does take away from some of those games.
5316290	5318853	I don't know how you guys feel, but I hate it.
5320280	5322041	Do you use that control pad a lot, DarkSakura?
5322061	5322821	I don't really hate it.
5323601	5324702	I can't stand it.
5324762	5327623	It does not feel nearly as slick as Sony's pad.
5327843	5331124	No, that's true, but I never had a problem with it, really.
5331385	5332185	Not that much of a problem.
5332585	5332845	Hmm.
5333525	5333886	Alright.
5334486	5335086	Well, there you have it.
5336086	5339848	It should be like the Wii D-pad.
5340228	5341048	That'd be awesome.
5341929	5342149	But...
5342802	5343703	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5368832	5369653	and eat it for free.
5370333	5371454	So that's pretty awesome.
5371734	5373975	And Banjo-Kazooie, of course, coming out for $40.
5374015	5379577	If I remember correctly, mid-November.
5380157	5383819	That would be like the 17th or 16th?
5384299	5384699	I don't remember.
5384719	5387100	I don't know.
5387781	5388221	It's kind of neat.
5388841	5389321	Not my game.
5391242	5391883	Not my thing.
5392523	5393023	No, seriously.
5393203	5395964	There's tons of Banjo-Kazooie fans out there, though, that I'm sure are very excited.
5395984	5397405	It's not... I don't know.
5402511	5403432	I think I should.
5404113	5404433	Why?
5405534	5407556	Just to get the achievement points.
5407596	5408097	Admit it, Loki.
5408117	5408697	That's what you want to do.
5408717	5410439	You want to go back and get the achievement points.
5410719	5416945	Yeah, I do, but also I want to just play through the game because it's supposed to be pretty cool.
5417625	5423334	Also coming out to Xbox Live Arcade someday is a Lode Runner remake.
5433369	5434470	They had it on Apple IIe.
5434630	5436131	I had this game on Commodore 64.
5436752	5438173	Basically it was a very simple game.
5438213	5440474	It was kind of like a puzzle slash action game.
5440774	5445678	You played this little stick man who ran around and there were ladders and monkey bars that you could kind of crawl across.
5446218	5451882	What you would know this game best for was how you could dig a hole in the bricks and fall through them in a certain strategy.
5452082	5452842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5476275	5476835	It's coming.
5477355	5478076	Somewhat soon.
5478816	5480217	Maybe before the holidays, I don't know.
5481477	5484638	They've got a lot of good releases coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
5484798	5485539	You know, I don't know though.
5485559	5495803	I've got to admit, Lode Runner is kind of one of those 80s early games that was a lot of fun back in the day, but I think if you played it now, I think the nostalgia would be gone soon, unless they've made a lot of updates and changes to it.
5496663	5499064	This game has gone through a lot of different stages.
5499084	5503086	There was a version put out in the early 90s, I want to say by Sierra, on Windows 9.
5503726	5504568	either Windows 95 or 3.1.
5505130	5505571	I don't remember.
5505851	5509019	There was a kind of version with souped up graphics that added some stuff to it.
5510848	5512208	I don't know.
5512368	5515729	Queltipo in chat says, Lode Runner was the game of choice in my school library.
5516089	5519770	Ours was Montzuma Revenge in the early, early days.
5520010	5522451	And then when I got into junior high school, Scorched Earth.
5523331	5524171	It's all about Scorched Earth.
5524331	5525131	Love Scorched Earth.
5525291	5525632	Kicks.
5526012	5528912	You saw that they're making a Scorched... Sorry, Kicks was what I was playing in school.
5529212	5531933	Well, you had to issue Classic Game of the Week a few weeks ago for a reason.
5531973	5536354	You saw that they're making a Scorched Earth type game that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
5537154	5538254	That's awesome.
5538635	5539855	I hope it has... You know, like...
5540735	5543596	Worms is kind of like Scorched Earth, though.
5543816	5547776	But I want something that's really kind of scaled.
5548156	5552317	I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's actually scaled back a bit in terms of, you know, you are a tank.
5552457	5553237	You do not move.
5554158	5556298	I love the craziness of Scorched Earth.
5556578	5559659	Remember how you could get those nuclear bombs that would blow up past the screen?
5560279	5561639	That was what I was talking about.
5562419	5564540	Just port Scorched Earth to Xbox Live Arcade.
5564560	5565800	There'd be a heck of people that would play it.
5566735	5567895	VGA Tank Anger Management Issues
5588183	5590004	Well, need anger management training.
5591425	5597668	Not really so much as just need to not take out their frustrations on the inanimate object.
5598568	5609174	However, there was a man who had warned his three sons about how they were misbehaving while playing their Xbox.
5609194	5612656	And this is an old, monstrosity, humongous Xbox.
5613756	5618798	And so, he took their Xbox and nailed it to a tree.
5621339	5624880	Ripped out the circuit board, everything, and nailed it to a tree.
5624920	5625800	Just like Jesus.
5626700	5627400	Stop it.
5627801	5628921	That must have been a big nail.
5631858	5635299	and their mother is saying the problem was addressed properly.
5635759	5637459	I think it was addressed very poorly.
5638019	5642640	And, you know, if they feel like wasting however much it cost at the time, feel free.
5642721	5643941	Waste the money all you want to.
5644541	5653223	However, they are putting the Nailed to a Tree Xbox... Well, I should say the...
5655208	5660392	or maybe as Loki was saying, the Jesus Edition Xbox on eBay.
5661633	5662914	It's on an auction right now.
5663054	5666317	Of course, because people are retarded and will pay lots of money for that crap.
5666337	5666977	Remember that one?
5667298	5669199	Actually, there was more to that.
5669399	5669719	Sorry.
5669960	5670280	Thank you.
5671621	5678026	Half of the proceeds are going to be going to their local schools and the other half will be going to the Children's College Fund.
5678507	5679128	Thanks for watching!
5690572	5692113	Over a thousand dollars for it.
5692253	5692833	Preposterous.
5693113	5694014	It was just retarded.
5694234	5696275	I mean, people do not buy this thing.
5696315	5699217	It's a broken Xbox, and you're really going to pay good money for it?
5699457	5702478	I hope someone buys it, because then I can laugh at them for being a big fucking idiot.
5704099	5712624	However, the most important question that rises from this, as Joystick asks, will it blend?
5714685	5714905	No.
5715365	5715846	I bet it will.
5716346	5718027	This type of idiocy will not blend.
5718871	5726524	Well, at any rate, I definitely... I want to find out who wins the auction just so that I can publicly ridicule them.
5727386	5728688	I need good laughing fodder.
5728748	5729530	Some people disagree.
5729590	5731393	ShowerAnne in chat says, This dad kicks ass.
5733620	5736222	I find it interesting that it's funding the kids' college fund, though.
5736542	5738484	It's kind of an interesting little side effect to it.
5739264	5743067	I hate to back up and go to the last story, but damn, I was curious.
5743187	5746109	And Bobby Blackwell filled me in as well on some stuff going on.
5746409	5750272	Apparently there is a Java version of Scorched Earth that you can play online.
5750612	5751713	And he actually gave me the address here.
5751773	5754955	Scorch2000.com You can actually still play Scorched Earth.
5755236	5756497	And I was looking at Wikipedia, though.
5756517	5757737	I don't think that's an official port.
5757797	5761180	It's some type of clone game.
5761580	5771042	But apparently, according to Wikipedia, back in 2005, the original developer said that more information on the official version might surface soon.
5771343	5772703	It was reiterated in 2006.
5773503	5777864	Apparently, there's some type of Scorched Earth project that's been going on since March of 2006.
5779345	5784126	You can get a CD called Totally Scorched through the official website of Scorched Earth for $20.
5786121	5787043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5794181	5794421	All right.
5795302	5797743	However, I do not want Xbox Tree Dad on our show.
5797823	5800105	I think I would just not be able to control it because it's a little silly.
5800125	5801386	I'd have to make fun of him, too.
5801686	5802166	A little silly.
5802226	5802566	I don't know.
5803067	5803447	You're right.
5803507	5806169	It's more the person who buys this than him.
5806809	5809791	I mean, you know, however you want to parent your kids is your business.
5809811	5816495	I think that he was right to punish the children, but, you know, why not just put the functional Xbox on eBay?
5817196	5819177	And then that way you're, you know...
5820458	5822319	Getting money for selling a functional product?
5822680	5824221	Whatever happened to just taking the cord?
5826082	5826783	Seriously.
5827063	5830125	See, that never worked with me because I would always find it.
5831667	5832547	It never worked with me either.
5832587	5833908	My mother took my TV away.
5833928	5835189	This is how much of a brat I was.
5835590	5842015	My mother took my TV away and I went and took it back and hooked everything back up and told her she couldn't do that because it was theft because she never bought it for me.
5842967	5846849	Better yet, and I know we're kind of contributing to this, why is this news?
5847589	5848489	I know, I know.
5848829	5856773	I mean, seriously, it's like, kid gets punished in some creative way, and I mean, who reported on this first?
5856793	5861755	I mean, obviously we reported on a story that someone else reported on, but did this, like, make the paper?
5861855	5864936	I mean, is this like in Iowa or something, you know?
5865856	5880319	The person who needs to actually make themselves a username instead of being OLR me recruit whatever just linked the article up via eBay auction I should say.
5881879	5882799	Right now $8.50.
5883419	5883840	So good.
5883920	5885020	No one's really bidding on this.
5886260	5887060	Sick sad world.
5888820	5891001	But the user's name is blocked whoever's bid on it.
5892099	5894120	I don't know, part of me wants to go in or a bit on this.
5894900	5896241	No, do not.
5896701	5897281	I'm tempted.
5897902	5898702	I'm so tempted.
5899242	5899523	All right.
5901543	5904565	What else do I want to say real quick about... Ah, I forgot.
5905785	5906486	Train derailed.
5907086	5907866	Oh, well, we'll move on.
5908027	5909327	Did your train sink in the ocean?
5909407	5910128	Yes, it did.
5910148	5911808	There was something else I wanted to say about this whole thing.
5912409	5914430	Was it something I wanted to read in chat?
5916571	5917251	I think it was.
5920845	5922405	Sorry for the quietness.
5922425	5925886	I'm reading the chat here.
5925966	5927666	Joshi16 says, I don't believe it.
5927706	5929847	This is a quick way to sell a broken console.
5930707	5931127	Very interesting.
5931147	5938208	I can just make up a cockamamie story about... Yes, and you get it on the news and people will do it.
5939169	5942169	See, I'm not an idiot that ruins my own systems.
5942589	5946410	Everything that I have is still functional except for one 7800 that needs a new power supply.
5948313	5953867	Take a console system and say it's haunted or something and come up with some sort of YouTube viral video.
5956169	5985025	TigerClaw says what the dad did was appalling there was a perfectly good Xbox the kids are going to be screwed when they find out there's a brand new Xbox 360 has limited backwards compatibility I know what I wanted to say earlier about the whole taking the cord thing what I found out was that when my mom would take the cord to my Nintendo that the cord from her VCR would work just fine in place of it yeah it was the old RCA red yellow things they're all the same so I would just take the cord from her VCR and it would work just fine in the Nintendo and she was not happy so
5986646	5987086	Not happy.
5988427	5993189	And I'm not condoning any other kids to be exactly as brat-tastic as I was.
5994210	6004875	And DarkTestia, yeah, the 7800s have a really weird power supply, but they were also fairly unreliable as far as how well they stayed functional.
6004915	6006836	So if you find a working one, you hold on to it.
6010440	6027920	I was a real big brat and I'm not ashamed of myself I'm not ashamed because my bratliness meant that I actually had a brain and was willing to use it to my own benefit and now that I'm an adult I can use my brain even better
6028462	6030943	Bobby says you will never grow up to amount to anything.
6031003	6031643	Happy face.
6031703	6033244	Yeah, too many people said that.
6033284	6034204	Here we are on the internet.
6034785	6035525	Alright, look at me now.
6035545	6037606	Yeah, well, I'm a celebrity on the internet, so whatever.
6038266	6039126	I do what I want.
6039907	6042848	Alright, let's move on, please, Loki, before we get too ghetto.
6043757	6049906	Well, something that's not going to amount to anything apparently is the 2008 edition of the Digital Life Expo.
6050667	6056156	It's been cancelled because of poor economic conditions.
6056596	6058659	You people are too poor, so I don't know.
6060261	6069950	So yes, apparently the last two years they had a significant gaming presence and facing lack of interest in the show.
6070671	6076756	In 2007, Ziff Davis' apparent strategy was to put more focus on gaming for the 2008 edition.
6077377	6080820	But that's not going to happen this year, obviously.
6081060	6083322	So here's hoping for 2009.
6087006	6090087	So just because of the recession, that's what they're chalking it up to?
6090507	6091228	Yep.
6092808	6093068	Huh.
6094189	6094989	Oh, I guess that's too bad.
6095009	6100031	Apparently the conventions run off of pure gasoline, and so, you know, gas prices going up.
6100051	6103553	I thought that they had to use twigs and, you know, fire.
6105273	6105733	All right.
6105833	6109015	Well, sorry to say, but Digital Life 2008 is canceled.
6116516	6116937	There you go.
6117457	6119140	For those of you that had already bought your plane tickets.
6120021	6128692	Anyhow, I'm sure we have a lot of New Yorkers who are very pissed off at the news that Digital Life 2008 is canceled because there were some that used to always call in and talk to us about it.
6129113	6132618	So in your honor, we will do the FUs of the week right now.
6148669	6164679	My FU of the week goes towards my husband being at the Game Crazy Manager Conference in Las Vegas and me not being able to go to Las Vegas to go to Star Trek Experience while he has to work.
6165620	6166921	I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
6167021	6168222	Oops.
6168422	6169843	But no, I actually do...
6172012	6179813	I do miss my boy a bit, and the sad thing is that he'll be coming back Wednesday, but we'll be leaving Thursday, so I actually have to miss my art class.
6180193	6188035	Like, maybe go to an hour of it, so I'm trying to think of how I can balance going to school and going to... and, you know, still getting to the airport on time.
6188075	6193416	Yeah, because you still have to get to the airport like an hour and a half early for all the check-ins and all that crap, so... Fun fun!
6193436	6196476	That would be... I'd have to... Leave the house at four.
6197196	6198777	Because you've got traffic on top of that.
6198837	6200317	I'd have to probably miss school that day.
6200637	6201117	Oh, bummer.
6201584	6202584	I was just finding out what I have to draw.
6227971	6228691	I was pretty beat.
6228832	6231854	And also I had to wake up really early and I went to bed at 1 in the morning.
6232575	6234617	So it's all stuff that's my fault, but you know.
6236198	6241583	Like a normal American, I'm not going to take responsibility for it anyways.
6242764	6243384	So F you then.
6243705	6246267	Blackwolf says this is why you play video games instead of real games.
6247583	6251306	I know, but I'm trying to get out more because it's supposedly good for me.
6251326	6253568	This is why we can't have nice things.
6254249	6256250	And besides, it's shooting guns.
6256350	6257331	I mean, come on.
6257411	6259273	Who doesn't like shooting guns at people?
6259673	6260994	And without them getting hurt.
6261074	6261975	I mean, it's awesome.
6262315	6268581	As long as you're in direct sunlight for 15 minutes, your body will make a sufficient amount of vitamin D, which you need to be healthy.
6268661	6269982	So good for you being outside.
6270042	6274786	Yes, I've got my outside quota done for about the next few weeks, so I'm good.
6277274	6278716	I'll make my FUs short.
6280277	6281217	FU to breakups.
6282378	6283279	They're no fun at all.
6284120	6285221	We'll just leave it at that.
6286662	6287122	The end.
6288643	6300733	Let's go on, talk about other stuff, such as... A stupid award to give away tonight.
6302735	6305297	To this woman, Kimberly Jernigan.
6307901	6309182	What the hell did she do?
6310683	6315348	Well, she played Second Life, but that's not the only reason why we're giving her one.
6315368	6318550	Because otherwise we'd have to give a lot of people a stupid award.
6319311	6323134	Apparently, here's the thing, she was actually having a romance in Second Life.
6323575	6329260	And when her Second Life boyfriend guy dumped her or whatever... Who was a lion.
6330020	6330641	Or a tiger.
6331241	6332142	And bears, oh my.
6332963	6334144	Apparently, here's what happened.
6334725	6334825	Um...
6336206	6337247	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6358806	6379170	and she was driving up from North Carolina to come kidnap this guy or whatever and she brought her dog with her the third time and so she cut the screen to get into this person's house and was waiting for him to get home from work and the dog kept barking and so what did the gal do?
6379570	6387232	She bound the dog and locked him in the bathroom so F you to this lady right here for being so cruel to animals um
6388212	6392755	Finally, the lion guy gets home and she had a pair of handcuffs with her and a laser.
6394816	6396397	Yes, that's right, a laser.
6396898	6399219	Like, I'm going to shine it in your eyes, you little bastard.
6399639	6399960	I don't know.
6400660	6404222	So finally, she runs from the scene, leaving the poor dog behind.
6404923	6409506	She did, by the way, get caught at a turnpike rest stop in the state of Maryland.
6410126	6411627	And there it is.
6414329	6414649	I mean...
6416826	6421432	You're not helping the whole stereotypes around Second Life players, seriously.
6421912	6435088	I was going to say, there was also another one I had posted as part of the stupid awards there about some stupid kid who snuck onto his grandpa's eBay account and bought a Wii for almost 200,000 euros.
6438869	6440950	and the funny thing was he already had a Wii.
6441851	6443793	So parents, watch your kids.
6444153	6444373	For real.
6444393	6445434	Because they're bastards.
6446015	6451600	And in regards to our recipient of the Stupid Award this week, DJ Dark Knight in chat says, that's a crazy bitch.
6452912	6454353	I couldn't have said it any better myself.
6454693	6458536	I mean, is she really surprised that her relationship with the lion didn't work out?
6458556	6459697	I mean, seriously.
6460357	6462079	That wouldn't have ended well anyways.
6462399	6464821	And think of what the babies would have looked like.
6464841	6468003	I am pleased to see, though, it's not just the guys becoming crazy and going after the women.
6479456	6481418	Equal sexual representation here.
6481718	6484440	Women are capable of going crazy too, right DarkSakura?
6485601	6486481	What do you mean by that?
6487562	6488083	Never mind.
6490224	6494047	You just need to stop that train of thought right there and just be nice.
6494748	6495448	I'm always nice.
6495488	6496889	I'm the king of nice on the internet.
6498170	6498931	King of something.
6498951	6502273	Do we have more gaming news by chance?
6502954	6505255	Yes, and we have good gaming news.
6505516	6507137	Very, very good gaming news.
6509805	6522991	As I'm sure everyone knows by now, I've been super, super excited about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Cross Generation, which is going to be out in Japan this year.
6523631	6530814	And they're actually talking about bringing it out on Wii because they're saying that the title will be on a Wii-compatible board.
6532114	6532334	So...
6533996	6535338	I don't know.
6535599	6536300	I guess maybe.
6536440	6537723	So that would be kind of neat.
6538885	6543574	But I would be afraid of what it would look like on the Wii because it doesn't look like a Nintendo 64 game right now.
6544396	6545699	I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
6546519	6546959	No, I'm kidding.
6547559	6548960	I think it would actually be okay on Wii.
6549120	6549980	I think it would be alright.
6550960	6552680	But I don't want to play a fighting game on the Wii.
6552981	6554921	I do not want to play a fighting game on the Wii.
6555361	6558682	Unless Wii may be on the classic controller or something.
6558802	6559562	Or Smash Brothers.
6559922	6564263	I want this to be out on PS3 or Xbox 360.
6564423	6565023	That's what I want.
6566264	6567904	I want an arcade machine in my house.
6569404	6569744	Now.
6571785	6572945	How long until this game comes out?
6575706	6575986	Soon?
6576994	6577515	Fair enough.
6577975	6579316	We don't have much year left.
6579496	6580818	I guess that's true.
6581699	6583901	I'm sure DarkSakura will be importing this sooner rather than later.
6584414	6585514	It's always next year.
6586675	6588875	But, I don't know.
6588895	6588935	No!
6589336	6596058	So, it's another day and Nintendo's been sued again for the Wii.
6597038	6604360	Oh yes, someone else claims that they thought of the Wii first in Hillcrest Laboratories this time.
6604521	6608702	They are basically suing them for using their motion controller inventions.
6609924	6615772	and Hillcrest is seeking to block imports of the Wii and Wii Remote.
6617199	6617940	Why just imports?
6617960	6618700	That's kind of weird.
6619501	6622483	According to a complaint filed with the U.S.
6622684	6631211	International Trade Commission, they are also filing a civil lawsuit in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland.
6632392	6645783	While Hillcrest Labs has a great deal of respect for Nintendo and the Wii, Hillcrest Labs believes that Nintendo is in clear violation of its patent and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights.
6646881	6651224	And the three patents that they hold are for motion controller technology.
6651324	6653906	The fourth is for a graphic user interface.
6655087	6664693	And I guess they're behind the motion control technology of FreeSpace and a graphic interface called Home.
6666494	6669036	I don't know if that's the same as Sony's Home.
6669056	6669636	I assume not.
6674440	6676381	Everybody wants a piece of the Wii Pi.
6678812	6679473	Apparently.
6681955	6684356	I think they should just go on Judge Judy and settle this all.
6684476	6685958	Don't you think?
6686718	6687159	I don't know.
6687259	6692002	I know patent lawsuits take a while, but seriously.
6692162	6695705	It's like two years after this console's been out and you're just now suing them.
6697326	6699168	I have a hard time believing that
6701161	6702362	Get a life, you know, get a real job.
6729463	6731324	I eat morons like you up for breakfast.
6734605	6739607	You may live, hopefully, as long as I am, but you're not as smart as I am yet.
6741368	6741748	That's right.
6741788	6743529	Justice the American Way on Judge Judy.
6744189	6744490	All right.
6746951	6754174	Well, hopefully Nintendo doesn't get too sued, or the game that DarkSakura and I are most looking forward to, Animal Crossing City Folk, is never going to come out.
6755698	6756959	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6778095	6786981	So I'm wondering if that means that you can actually take your Wii game, download the travel information to the DS, and go to a friend's house so that we don't have to haul everything over since there's no memory cards, really, on the Wii.
6787401	6790383	I mean, I guess technically they have the SD card, but not a lot of people have that.
6790423	6791744	So, kind of interesting.
6791784	6795887	My question, and this is kind of interesting, how the fuck would you do that?
6795907	6803172	Because if you... I guess you could... No, you can't even really save it to your DS because there's no storage on the DS.
6805894	6806234	I don't know.
6806854	6807375	Unless...
6808800	6809641	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6832031	6833352	Zipper T. Bunny Bunny Day
6850020	6852762	Hmm, I wonder what Bunny Day could be.
6852902	6855804	Could it be a random Sunday between March and April?
6856284	6856744	Who knows?
6856784	6860267	That was stolen from pagan religions.
6860647	6861908	That was a fertility holiday.
6863730	6864450	I have no idea.
6889163	6892887	Every week you send us your love and adoration and cards and letters to our mailbag.
6892927	6894548	Mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com.
6894828	6898311	And DarkSakura opens up the old mailbag and reads some of her favorite emails.
6898391	6900353	But if I remember right, there's not a lot this week, is there?
6900613	6901194	There are three.
6901454	6901734	Wow.
6901854	6902335	Very slow.
6902415	6904336	Which means we got an extra during the show.
6904637	6907499	Mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com if you'd like to send in your emails.
6908200	6908460	What?
6908920	6909181	Uh-oh.
6909201	6912724	Sauce just said Jesus died so he can eat chocolate.
6912904	6913384	All right.
6913584	6914705	Let's open up the old mailbag.
6920291	6939153	The first email, um, it says, uh, Dear C4 and Kadabra and the OLR crew, I've been listening to your show since, oh my god, the spelling is atrocious, since episode one and have filled up my MP3 player for years and gave me all the gaming info before...
6943066	6969771	Before is not spelled letter B number 4, it's B-E-F-O-R-E V is spelled T-H-E, not D-A Magazines is spelled M-A-G-I-Z-I-N-E-S, not M-A-G-A-Z-E-N-S Did, and saved me tons of cash in the year to buy You spelled anime right, what the fuck And manga, my collection, my girlfriend, cheer princess wants a D-S or P-S God, use periods!
6969791	6970551	I'm not reading this email
6971209	6974272	No, you have to read the very end, because it does explain a little bit of the crappy email.
6974292	6977174	I know, but it was typed on a Wii, no spell or grammar check, well screw it!
6977834	6978955	I don't need grammar check!
6979436	6980797	And they make a thing called a dictionary.
6982178	6987582	Actually, they do have the mode where you type it in stuff, you start to type it in, and it spells it for you, so.
6989244	6989604	That's lame.
6991041	6998529	You know, if I was all into the soundboards as much as the chatroom thinks I am, this is the part where I would play the clip from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
6998889	6999951	You get nothing!
7000431	7001212	You lose!
7001772	7002854	Good day, sir!
7005129	7005829	Next email.
7005970	7008531	Okay, now I'm going to finish it because I'm a nice person.
7009051	7009291	Alright.
7009311	7011072	And I'm really trying to be nicer to people.
7011552	7015675	And I mean nothing bad against this person as a person.
7016435	7017596	Just don't be so fucking lazy.
7018716	7019357	It's not hard.
7019457	7021278	It doesn't take that much more time to type it.
7021738	7023119	Or to use your actual email.
7023639	7024159	Alright, yeah.
7024900	7026720	Okay.
7027121	7030242	She loves Myspace and mystery and roleplay games.
7030342	7031263	What should I get her?
7031343	7031963	PSP or DS?
7032163	7032524	Get her a DS.
7034955	7039079	and advice on how to get more than five listeners on my podcast, PokeFan Radio.
7042242	7043123	Advertise, dude.
7043563	7045105	Go out and whore yourself out.
7045765	7055574	We used to post on all these different message boards and put a link to our podcast and our radio station and our signatures and just posted the fuck out of them, so go for that.
7055795	7056435	That's what you should do.
7057456	7067318	Um, and I'm, I'm very, and I feel, you know, bad that you have a level 70 and your girlfriend only has a level 10, but you do need to study.
7069119	7080522	You know, she's, okay, to translate his email into English, he says that his girlfriend says to log off and study or he's going to drop out and live in his mother's basement.
7081782	7081862	Um,
7083419	7084520	and that he sleeps in class.
7085300	7086921	Your email is quite evident of this.
7088441	7094344	It's really a good idea if you log off of World of Warcraft and pay more attention in English class.
7094824	7095165	Please.
7097005	7097626	Please.
7098386	7107850	I'm urging you to take the goddamn time to pay attention and dispel shit right and use periods and use one period.
7107891	7108791	Okay, I'm going to press use one.
7110071	7110831	Oops, sorry about that.
7111632	7113193	You just got a break in the podcast there.
7113213	7116554	We had some live difficulties in the studio when I tried to play a sound clip.
7116594	7117875	It screwed up the recording of the show.
7118315	7123658	Right in the middle of Jamie's rant, which is probably to the blessing of the emailer.
7123678	7124158	Hey!
7125579	7130242	Well, during the middle of this, though, Loki and I made some special announcements that only the live listeners get to hear.
7130262	7131542	There you go.
7131662	7134484	All the more reason to tune in live Sunday nights.
7135816	7136036	Yeah.
7136457	7137457	So, next email.
7137558	7138278	Dun-dun-dun.
7139179	7142182	Just in case you guys needed some mail, thank you, because we did.
7142622	7144284	Anyways, I'm a new listener, a.k.a.
7144324	7148868	The56Ker, came in on episode 283, but just wanted to say, what's up?
7148908	7149808	Your show is the best.
7150209	7151730	I need to get all the back episodes.
7152891	7156574	as possible, being as it's the only thing that gets me through the night at work.
7156614	7157195	You guys rock.
7157215	7158976	Keep on doing your thing, and I'll keep on listening.
7158996	7162199	I'm going to try to change my hours at work so I can tune in live on Sundays.
7162279	7163980	I'll let you know how that goes anyway later.
7164420	7172447	Also, you need to use capitalization and punctuation, and through is spelled T-H-R-O-U-G-H, not T-H-R-E-W.
7173007	7173828	But thanks for listening.
7174328	7175129	Thank you very much for listening.
7175149	7176730	But seriously, it's time to go broadband.
7177070	7179232	I mean, if you're still on 56K, you poor thing.
7179613	7180093	Poor, poor thing.
7180518	7188059	I provide these grammar and spelling lessons as a public service.
7188239	7188840	It's free.
7189420	7192360	I am trying to better the world through proper grammar and spelling.
7192740	7193540	One word at a time.
7194040	7194521	Exactly.
7195741	7197181	Last email, I think.
7198041	7206163	Regarding your latest PSA, if Triple H retires from wrestling, would it be acceptable to walk up to McMahon and say you just lost the game?
7207343	7207903	Didn't think so.
7209457	7210717	I love wrestling jokes, really.
7211698	7212558	That made me laugh.
7212658	7213838	Blink, blink, blink, blink.
7213858	7214918	Rob doesn't watch wrestling.
7214958	7215498	No, I do not.
7215538	7218099	He likes Glow, the gorgeous ladies of wrestling.
7219359	7221140	Yeah, I like watching... It was all about Godiva.
7221160	7223260	I like watching lady wrestling.
7223280	7224020	And Mount Fuji.
7224421	7229182	One night at Rocky Horror, we actually did a wrestling-themed night at Rocky Horror Picture Show.
7229202	7230422	We did a TLC match.
7230822	7232622	We did a tables, ladders, and cookie sheets.
7232762	7233003	It was fun.
7235919	7236819	That sounds pretty great.
7236919	7237720	It was pretty awesome.
7237800	7239660	Also, also, also, last part to this.
7239760	7243201	I got to play the a-hole guy that's in charge of the WD... What's his name?
7243221	7243521	McMahon.
7243621	7244062	McMahon.
7244182	7246382	Yeah, but we changed everybody's name slightly, so I was him.
7247463	7250124	Also, is it acceptable to be offended by people being offended?
7250644	7256746	What about being offended by people being... This is from Robert M. You know what?
7256786	7262187	Just everyone needs to learn how to get over themselves and be a little bit more accepting of everybody else around them.
7262908	7263088	Right.
7263108	7263648	The end!
7264619	7273946	If you want to send us some emails and get taunted by Jamie, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Have your spelling and grammar evaluated.
7275109	7276770	I corrected my teacher.
7277110	7282073	You should start grading their emails based on their spelling and grammar.
7282093	7303025	Those last two just got an E. My teacher put in the syllabus that if we can ever find any spelling or grammatical errors that he puts in any of the documentation he puts it on the website for my painter class then we get an extra bonus point for class and I found one right away and emailed it to him.
7303805	7305267	So I now have a bonus point for the class.
7305287	7306248	We hadn't even done anything.
7308290	7313274	Alright, let's get back to gaming news before we turn into the grammar podcast or whatever.
7314395	7315416	There's a really good one too.
7316197	7318699	We inspire you all to do more gooder on your emails.
7318919	7319200	Alright.
7321101	7321542	Loki.
7322963	7325325	Well, yet another rumor that came true.
7325425	7328889	The PSP 3000 was announced at Leipzig this week.
7330354	7338801	And like the rumors had stated, it has a built-in microphone and a PlayStation button instead of a home button.
7339522	7354836	Other changes that have happened, the LCD screen is a lot more responsive and also a little bit brighter or easily viewed in the highlight situations.
7356683	7382206	and supposedly they're going to be updating the core pack which will be coming out in November which will come with a black system a 4 gig memory stick and a voucher for everyday shooter and what's kind of neat also the PSP 3000 is a little bit more rounded but that's basically it and it comes with Pi
7383342	7384103	and that's why I won.
7384123	7385183	No, the pie is a lie.
7385323	7385523	What?
7386664	7388145	No free Marie Callender's pie?
7388205	7388726	What's up with that?
7389266	7389566	I don't know.
7390227	7392828	I just thought with everything else they were throwing in, maybe they'd throw in a pie.
7392848	7394930	I mean, who doesn't like pie?
7396420	7397040	I don't like pie.
7417754	7418555	In Japan, anyway.
7418895	7420257	And it's all happening in October.
7420878	7431473	The games that are going to be released simultaneously, Bleach Soul Carnival, because, you know, you just need another Bleach game, and Yusha no Kusei ni Namikadikira is coming out.
7432586	7438508	Digital distribution and the exact same day a PSP retail counterpart, exact same time.
7439088	7442009	Both versions are only going to send you back 1,000 yen.
7442029	7444110	That's about $10 or so.
7444510	7445690	So kind of interesting there.
7445890	7446331	Oh, I'm sorry.
7446391	7446891	I take that back.
7446971	7449091	The downloadable version is actually $10 less.
7449772	7450492	So, huh.
7450872	7454013	I wonder if, you know, because there's no case, no manual, no disk, whatever.
7454393	7457594	So kind of interesting there, the approach they're taking.
7458054	7459735	I don't know if that's a dangerous one or what.
7461644	7467329	It's happening in Japan, not here, so it'll be interesting to see if it sets any precedence for here, or if they try to do something similar here.
7467770	7468090	Who knows?
7469171	7469511	We'll see.
7470512	7471172	I'm sorry, I gotta say this.
7471433	7477237	Amaze Satsuma in chat says this, PSP 3000 came with Pi, it should be called PSP 3.14 then.
7477357	7480180	Nice, I get it.
7480420	7481120	I see what you did there.
7481901	7482261	Good job.
7482281	7483803	Math joke.
7486580	7488442	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7506556	7525389	Well now, because it's still popular, what has been released now by TechToy, which is a Sega licensee, the Master System 3 is now out, and it looks sort of like an old Genesis, and it has a Sonic painted on it in blue.
7526369	7528511	and like an Outline Sonic.
7529171	7533695	And it has 131 built-in games on it, G-rated games.
7534195	7535657	So it has no cartridge slot.
7536437	7537558	And retails for about $133 US dollars.
7541764	7546106	It actually, and I'm going to the webpage to see if it's hopefully not written in Portuguese.
7547607	7551008	Okay, some of the games that are on it.
7552209	7557151	Shadow Dancer, which was one of the really good Shinobi games.
7557991	7561752	Alex Kidd in Miracle World, Shinobi World, Lost Stars, High Tech World, those.
7562932	7567214	You also have Enduro Racer, eSWAT, which was one of those games that was downgraded.
7567774	7574576	Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2, Fantasy Zone 3, Golden Axe, Hang On, Ken Seiden.
7575616	7577436	What's another good one that was on here?
7579317	7579857	Thunder Blade.
7581577	7589186	Super Space Invaders, Sonic, Sonic Drift 2, and Rainbow Islands, Rastan Saga.
7591409	7592130	Lots of good stuff.
7595935	7597096	Oh, and Battle Outrun.
7599921	7601942	Hey, there's lots of folks that love the nostalgia.
7601962	7604443	I'm sure if they released something like that up here, some people would buy it.
7604463	7609165	Because, hey, they do the Genesis controller type things that have all the Sonic games in them.
7609565	7610246	Those sell really well.
7610266	7611046	I'll have to tell you, Rob.
7611066	7611546	Why not one of these?
7611906	7624953	I actually am very... Even though I have almost all of the games on the list that were out as actual Master System games, I'm actually considering that this might be a worthwhile purchase for my house.
7626041	7626421	Why not?
7626842	7627563	Add it to the museum.
7628323	7631166	You can actually download a lot of them emulated.
7632408	7635210	Really, they're very solid ports of the games.
7635511	7643719	There's even, I believe, a copy of Strider that came out on Master System in Brazil that was supposed to be pretty darn good for a Master System game.
7646082	7648124	I'd like to hear from some of our Brazilian listeners.
7648164	7649125	Let us know what you think of this.
7649943	7651164	Do we have any Brazilian listeners?
7651184	7651604	I think we do.
7651704	7653126	You don't even have to tell us what you think of this.
7653166	7655948	Just say, hi, I'm from Brazil, because I'm curious if we actually have listeners there.
7657169	7658250	Alright, moving on.
7659238	7664022	Right, we've got a bunch of homebrew news and hacking news to tell you about.
7664662	7668025	So, real quickly, I'm going to mention four things that are kind of neat.
7668585	7671087	First, Sailor Moon.
7671767	7684677	Apparently there's some guy making a few homebrew Sailor Moon games, some of which are going to be on the Wii, and they are sprite-based brawlers, which is kind of interesting, so...
7685886	7688667	They've released actual Sailor Moon fighting games.
7688707	7691328	My first important game was the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game.
7692928	7703112	But, what's even bigger than that, of course, and how we cannot forget this, the Wii has been hacked to allow DVD video playback.
7704492	7714076	There's a patch where actually you can install a program using the Homebrew channel and it will allow you to...
7716049	7733024	Play DVDs, like DVD movies, and also the enabled DVD-capable homebrew programs such as Nintendo 64 emulators that can read ROMs straight off of a DVD disc.
7734826	7737728	So way to go beating Nintendo at their own game.
7738208	7740551	That is actually all kinds of funny, I have to admit.
7740711	7742692	Come on, who isn't thinking this is hilarious?
7743013	7743193	Yeah.
7744079	7744920	Magnetic Shaping Derby
7764787	7766728	So, I don't know.
7767008	7768349	That's kind of interesting.
7768890	7778155	If that's not your cup of tea, then maybe you should check out one of the many games that are available thanks to the Neo Summer Coding Competition 2008.
7778315	7783939	They have lots of cool games for the DS, Game Boy Advance, and the PSP.
7784759	7788942	And they're all homebrew, including updates, of course, to...
7792057	7793838	Thank you for watching!
7819073	7819453	and DarkSakura.
7844149	7848193	So tonight, guys, we can only get access through the Orange Lounge Radio username on Skype.
7848233	7850475	That's how the majority of you are calling us anyway.
7852397	7864467	Something that has been announced at X08 in Toronto, Duke Nukem 3D is coming out for the Xbox Live Arcade sometime in September, which is pretty cool because that means, like, soon.
7864927	7867610	And new to Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade?
7868230	7888184	a saved film and gameplay rewind feature I mean if you thought it was cool and braid it's going to be even more awesome when you can actually just rewind I don't know if it's the touch of a button or how that's going to work but you'll actually be able to rewind gameplay if you want to undo something you screwed up and then if you want to share with an emulator
7888824	7889625	Like with an emulator?
7889966	7891567	I guess so, which is kind of neat.
7891908	7892989	You can also save films.
7893029	7899896	Like if you have an especially memorable time that you shot a stripper and you want to share it with your friends, you could put it on a film.
7900036	7901417	And YouTube's galore.
7902819	7903539	Just wait for it.
7903980	7905121	Duke Nukem 3D.
7905141	7907704	I hope the graphics are getting a little bit of a touch-up, though.
7908284	7909806	That's one thing I'm kind of looking forward to.
7912016	7916300	Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.
7916360	7923266	Please, if you're going to use Skype to give us a call, please make sure you have contacted Echo123 at some point before you call us.
7923386	7924147	It's already ringing.
7924788	7925829	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7925849	7926209	Who's this?
7927390	7928331	Hey, it's Ranma.
7928971	7929632	Well, hello.
7929712	7930913	You always seem to get through first.
7930933	7931634	What's on your mind, buddy?
7932731	7933352	Not too much.
7933432	7935553	I have a few things I want to discuss.
7935613	7937855	I'll make everything as quick and possible.
7937955	7938155	Sure.
7938455	7938716	Okay.
7939536	7943839	I remember as a kid, I got in trouble for doing something stupid.
7944400	7951085	My mother grabbed my new Tetris 2 game, the power adapter, and both my controllers and sent me off somewhere.
7951685	7955288	When she left, I waited about a good hour after she left the house.
7955388	7957150	I went and found myself and hooked it back up.
7958250	7960312	She probably was not happy when she got back home.
7962239	7966987	Yeah, there's still a mark on the back of my back as a reminder when she discovered what I did.
7968349	7971474	Ouch, sorry to hear it, but bad boy, bad boy.
7974420	7975141	What else was on your mind?
7994904	7995565	Interesting.
7995905	8003352	You don't think it has anything to do with just competing expos or maybe general, like a lot of folks say that digital life was not all that last year.
8003432	8007797	I would think if it's conflicting space issues that they could, I don't know, reschedule.
8009329	8015872	Yeah, because the thing was, all the second floor was going to be Digital Life, and downstairs was going to be NYAF.
8016292	8021295	But from what I'm hearing, NYAF is going to be the entire second floor, like Comic Con was this past year.
8021775	8026997	And from my understanding, they were letting people have free passes to Digital Life, so, you know.
8027497	8028978	I went last year, and I had a great time.
8031099	8031900	Well, who knows?
8032020	8033640	I mean, I guess they are rescheduling it for 2009.
8033680	8034301	No sweat off my back.
8037796	8040958	Well, you know, sucks to be the DDR people that were all excited about it.
8042019	8042819	Exactly.
8042859	8045120	For them, there's Dave and Busses and Chinatown Fair.
8046161	8046641	Exactly.
8046721	8047402	Anything else, Ranma?
8048583	8055707	Quick wrap-up of Otacon, because I know the Rob D is trying to call in to cover the game room aspect of it, so we went this year and it was great.
8057412	8061434	What about, since you're an anime expert, what were some of the good cosplays you saw?
8061854	8064195	Actually, I'm curious about video game cosplay specifically, though.
8064875	8069677	There was more video gaming cosplay at Otacon than anime cosplay.
8070358	8074079	The most popular was, believe it or not, Super Mario Brothers.
8074099	8076300	Everybody was running around as Mario or Luigi.
8076360	8077361	That was the thing this year.
8078146	8078727	Interesting.
8078807	8082410	Kind of seems a little like a standard.
8082890	8087674	You know, it's kind of like expecting to see, you're going to see a Naruto at some point or a Sailor Moon.
8088374	8091857	Yeah, there was some Sailor Moon cosplays, a lot of Naruto cosplays.
8091897	8095961	I mean, there wasn't even as many Final Fantasy cosplays this year as normally.
8096021	8099483	It's like, I guess, retro video gaming is a big thing.
8099604	8102426	And my theory is after New Super Mario Bros.
8102446	8104407	came out, everybody wants to do Mario Bros.
8104447	8104888	cosplay.
8106294	8108976	Plus, it's not that difficult, all things considered.
8110318	8112399	I mean, it might be kind of complicated to do a really good one.
8112420	8114662	You get someone to make the nice hat, the gloves, but you know.
8114842	8115202	Right, right.
8115883	8116063	Yeah.
8116403	8116643	All right.
8117444	8122809	Well, Ranma, thank you so much for the varied call tonight.
8123469	8124230	Of course, of course.
8124470	8127513	All right, have a good one, and have fun at that New York Anime Festival.
8127533	8127993	It should be fun.
8128954	8129375	Laters.
8129475	8129875	All right.
8130055	8130376	Bye-bye.
8131305	8134227	If you want to give us a call, Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.
8134287	8135567	Our 800 number is down tonight.
8136128	8139049	It will be back in a couple weeks when we're back live taking calls.
8140630	8141931	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8142851	8143332	Hey, what's up?
8143392	8145693	It's the Rob D. Well, hey, speak of the devil.
8145953	8147454	Ranma just talked about you in the last call.
8147474	8148635	So you went to Otacon this year.
8149035	8149555	Indeed I did.
8149575	8152837	I took the 12-hour drive over to Baltimore, and that was rough.
8153177	8153597	Wow.
8154178	8155218	Especially going through Ohio.
8156359	8156959	No offense to anyone.
8156999	8158740	Actually, no, complete offense to everyone in Ohio.
8158940	8159961	Ohio sucked to drive through.
8161085	8163808	It can't be as bad as some of the West Coast states to drive through.
8163848	8165930	Like, have you ever really driven through New Mexico?
8166871	8167391	No, I haven't.
8167491	8169553	There are some very beautiful parts of New Mexico.
8169593	8170154	Don't get me wrong.
8170194	8171355	No offense to the people that live there.
8171655	8173857	But there's some parts of New Mexico they're like, damn.
8174458	8178202	Or just anything east of Reno or Las Vegas and Nevada.
8178622	8179523	It's pretty terrible, too.
8180083	8184007	Well, and we got a ticket while we were driving through Ohio, so that kind of taints my view on things, too.
8184187	8184407	Ouch.
8184528	8185809	Yeah, that'd do it.
8186718	8187598	That's something that was beautiful.
8187698	8192600	But as for the con itself, I posted the link to my photo album in chat, my photo bucket.
8193400	8203423	I actually see me dressed up as Terry Bogard, which I got to say, I've been to Anime Central and I went to Otakon this year and I got a much better response over at Otakon.
8203463	8209024	I had people, I couldn't actually take like, I don't know, 20 steps through the convention without someone yelling, are you okay?
8209265	8210565	Or hey, come on, come on at me.
8211738	8212118	Nice.
8213159	8213539	It was fun.
8214360	8215721	The game room was huge.
8215921	8221305	Is it just because, you know, as Ranma was saying, there's more people doing video game cosplay this year, or do you think that's why more people recognize you?
8221785	8223206	Ha, I like this Metal Gear one.
8223526	8224027	That's great.
8224087	8227349	Two people put their little faces in a transmitter cutout there.
8227749	8228049	Love it.
8228290	8231512	Yeah, especially with the name reference to you with Otacon and Otacon.
8231732	8232332	Ah, true, true.
8232352	8234914	I don't know, there was a lot of anime stuff.
8235234	8240118	I actually kept a count of how many Shinigami versus how many Akatsuki I saw, you know, from Bleach and Naruto.
8241240	8242901	It ended up being tied at 154.
8245522	8251546	Wow, I'm trying to... Okay, wait, I found one of your Terry Bogard... Oh, you even got the hat there that says Fatal Fury.
8252687	8253647	You cannot have the hat.
8254047	8258930	Whether it's a metal plate for Fatal Fury, or whether it says Neo Geo or Fatal Fury, you gotta have it.
8259290	8261392	Let's see, what else is there that you got pictures of here?
8261872	8263753	Lucas from Mother 3, I want to see that one.
8265180	8268241	I'm looking at your photobucket, your username on photobucket if other people want to look at this.
8268341	8272162	It's the Reobd.
8272382	8274123	Someone already had the Reobd.
8274323	8274823	Oh, what a jerk.
8274843	8276704	It's T-H-E-R-E-A-B-O-D.
8278104	8278384	Nice.
8278564	8279504	I've got a pyramid head.
8279524	8281465	You can actually see Ranma and there's a black mage too.
8281845	8282185	Really?
8282805	8283005	Yes.
8283686	8284806	You can look at the tags on the left.
8285026	8286166	I have a tag that's Ranma.
8288467	8290548	Oh, he's got a new outfit.
8291068	8291628	In the dealer's room.
8292948	8293289	Nice.
8293409	8294009	Don't call him Evie.
8294029	8294709	He was pawning Hentai.
8296181	8297782	Oh, there's RanmaOLR.
8298582	8299702	Oh, no, that's the old one I knew.
8299782	8301223	Okay, you have two Black Mages in there.
8302704	8303364	Oh, interesting.
8303504	8304804	Sorry, this is making for horrible radio.
8305725	8308026	But definitely lots of video game cosplay.
8308106	8309066	The game room was gigantic.
8309086	8311547	There's actually a YouTube video, I think, of the game room.
8312227	8318090	Much, much bigger than the one over at ASEN, but this one had pretty much an entire... I don't even know how to put it.
8318110	8323932	Probably about... If you took a Sam's Club and split it in half, that half would be how big the game room was.
8325854	8329737	or Costco or whatever your regional giant bulk store would be.
8330317	8331078	And they had everything.
8331698	8335741	Lots of shooters, lots of fighting games, mostly, you know, most of the anime-related stuff.
8336742	8338363	Fatal Fury, Street Fighter.
8339004	8344427	I saw a few people dressed up as Kenso from King of Fires, which confused the heck out of me because... Kenso?
8344528	8344748	Really?
8344808	8345488	That's cool.
8347710	8352033	And they kind of wanted to hang out with me since they found another guy with KOF cosplay, but oh well.
8353376	8355677	I'm actually trying to look at YouTube here.
8355697	8356797	It just looks like a big line.
8358658	8358998	Let's see.
8359058	8362439	I'm trying to find... Yeah, I guess there's a huge line to get in the game room.
8364359	8365620	I've never seen a Leona cosplayer.
8365640	8369641	That would have been nice because a friend of mine and I went as Ralph and Clark at the Ascent.
8369980	8397926	well at Anime Expo two of my friends that I used to hang out with online who each had a Ralph and Clark name for a while we ended up going for the big KOF meet there but my costume is about three sizes too big for me now but I was thinking about remaking it I think my favorite picture in that whole album is Sergeant Frog as L from Death Note so great that's cool
8399141	8421433	but um again the game room lots of stuff lots of the games you know again it's pretty much all rhythm fighting rhythm and fighting games um tons of people playing brawl i think they probably had like i don't even know eight or twelve tvs giant hgtvs playing brawl um gears of war was gears of war halo 3 and call of duty 4 were there which surprised me a little bit but you know you've got a lot of people that like to play that online so it's not too shocking i suppose
8423172	8425753	Uh, pretty much any fighting game you could ever want.
8425853	8431176	KOF 98 on Neo Geo, um, KOF 11, um, what else?
8431236	8432117	Marvel vs. Capcom.
8432417	8437379	I think I said, uh, 1K we had Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Capcom vs. SNK 2, even Street Fighter Alpha 3 was there.
8437879	8444083	So it's just fighting game heaven, but that doesn't surprise me really, considering, you know, it's, uh, you know, anime con and all that.
8444783	8444863	Hmm.
8445270	8446350	Yeah, lots of rhythm games.
8446390	8449492	Poppin' Music, DDR, I saw Beatmania there.
8450892	8451272	What else?
8451572	8456854	Oh, the best part about that was that those were hooked up to standard TVs instead of HDTVs, just so you didn't have the lag.
8457595	8465778	What do you think of, speaking of Poppin' Music, what do you think of, I don't know if you were here during Part A, we talked about Beat and Groovy, the Xbox Live Arcade port of Poppin' Music.
8467679	8468379	I didn't hear about that.
8468639	8469160	Oh, God.
8469180	8470360	It's going to be interesting.
8471401	8473642	I don't know how that will really work with the Xbox 360 controller.
8474002	8475382	Yeah, especially with that D-pad.
8478364	8481545	Not really my thing, and I wouldn't expect it to work very well.
8481745	8484226	Is there even a 360 pop music controller?
8484466	8485287	No, no.
8486147	8488528	So it's going to be different.
8488828	8489708	Let's just leave it at that.
8490669	8493090	All right, Rob D., anything else you want to share about Otacon with us?
8494448	8499211	I've got tons of stories, but honestly nothing really short enough to say here.
8499932	8501493	Well, except the Kool-Aid Man made quite a stir.
8501513	8507696	When the Kool-Aid Man went through, there was a guy with a boombox in front of him playing one of the jingles from the Kool-Aid commercial.
8508717	8513480	It was almost like the Red Sea Party wherever he went because everyone just got out of the way and started taking pictures.
8514602	8515443	That's pretty awesome, though.
8515463	8518625	But what the hell does a Kool-Aid man have to do with anime cons?
8519145	8520787	You see the most random stuff, but it's awesome.
8520987	8521827	I mean, I'm sure you've heard it.
8521867	8522888	People are thirsty.
8522908	8523549	They need a Kool-Aid.
8523629	8524810	They need a Kool-Aid, absolutely.
8525250	8527231	All right, take care, Rob D. See you later.
8527251	8527812	Talk to you later.
8529733	8530714	Hey, hey, hey.
8530734	8533596	Actually, that was Fat Albert, but, you know, same thing.
8534117	8536158	All right, we'll take one more call.
8536799	8537799	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8537819	8538180	Who's this?
8538440	8539040	Kool-Aid man.
8540421	8540701	Hello?
8541622	8542283	Hi, who's this?
8542703	8543984	Hey, it's Rielman.
8544758	8545999	Hey, you're very, very quiet.
8546039	8547140	Can you get a little closer to your mic?
8548000	8550622	Yeah, I was just... Hello.
8551443	8551943	Any better?
8552323	8552724	Hello?
8553444	8554665	We can barely hear you.
8554725	8556787	Get out your question and we'll try to answer it.
8558768	8559549	Uh, no.
8559729	8561690	I just wanted to say hi.
8561710	8563131	I don't know where my mic is.
8563992	8568675	Um, I just wanted... I haven't listened to Orange Line on this radio in forever.
8569055	8570636	And I figured tonight I'd listen.
8570937	8572037	So, hi.
8572618	8572718	Um...
8573516	8574397	I don't really have a question.
8574477	8578379	I just want to say I'm getting raped at Dr. Mario and it's making me feel really bad about myself.
8581320	8584702	Alright, well thank you for the call and good luck finding the microphone.
8585743	8587104	I'm hearing too much feedback on that call.
8587604	8591626	I think he said something about getting raped at Dr. Mario.
8591746	8592027	I don't know.
8592047	8593347	Maybe I misheard that.
8593427	8593687	I don't know.
8594148	8596449	Anyway, well thanks for listening and especially Mr. Hyattis.
8596489	8597309	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8597330	8597650	Who's this?
8598310	8600831	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.
8600892	8601212	It is a...
8602392	8608215	Long time listener, disappearing for long time, reappearing for short time, and lather, rinse, repeat.
8608515	8609416	Now, where the hell have you been?
8610776	8611016	Busy.
8611337	8611577	Life.
8611777	8618200	Sundays are not the most free for me anymore for a number of reasons, and that's about to start over again.
8618620	8619201	Yeah, I'm sorry.
8619221	8621542	I should have had you introduce yourself for those that don't know your voice.
8622242	8622983	Hi, I'm Jason.
8623163	8623743	I'm a cool guy.
8623923	8626204	I'm technically part of Orange Lounge Radio, too.
8626324	8626685	You are.
8626965	8627285	You are.
8627984	8631288	So I'm just looking at the awesome Pyramid Head cosplay that Rob D is sharing with us.
8631329	8632150	Alright, so what's on your mind?
8632170	8634913	So you've been busy, but what provokes the call tonight?
8635714	8641802	Um, I think that Konami should not make any more music games for America.
8642483	8642804	Ha ha!
8643684	8644584	You think that's it.
8644644	8646565	They've used up all their chances.
8647885	8648525	It's not even that.
8649346	8650766	I love Rock Band.
8650846	8651666	I absolutely do.
8651706	8655987	That game is absolutely amazing and it is way more than Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania ever were.
8656567	8657528	I loved Drum Mania.
8657648	8658708	I loved Guitar Freaks.
8659288	8661129	There's an arcade here that has the both of them.
8661669	8666910	The Guitar Freaks is first mix, so I don't really play it, but the Drum Mania is V and I go back and play it.
8667722	8668662	It had good music.
8668763	8669203	I liked it.
8669223	8669983	It was a fun game.
8670643	8678707	But for Americans, for sales and the ability to persist and survive in this market, it ain't going to happen.
8680288	8681988	Well, you say they shouldn't make any more music games.
8682108	8683469	What about DDR?
8683569	8685570	We covered that earlier.
8685830	8687151	There's always those games coming out.
8687811	8690492	Okay, minus that one because that one actually got popular somehow.
8692615	8694819	I guess it's the fact that so many other songs are English.
8695279	8702070	It's so frustrating, though, because games like Beatmania had so much potential, and to see a whimper out is just very sad.
8702751	8703812	You remember all the...
8705506	8706367	Yay, tongue-tied!
8706407	8706827	Woo-hoo!
8707307	8710189	Do you remember all the hoops we had to jump through to get 7-style?
8710250	8713092	And now look how big 2DX is for consoles in Japan again.
8713552	8714012	I remember.
8714253	8718275	Which, back then, I was highly critical of that whole thing, and I thought it was stupid.
8718296	8719136	I absolutely remember this.
8719176	8719777	Years ago.
8719797	8724160	It was one of the first things we talked about on the show, probably within the first year of OLR.
8724700	8732085	For those that weren't around six years ago, basically what Konami was doing is everybody had to sign a petition or something?
8732786	8739671	It was either 100,000 or 200,000 signatures and then 100,000 pre-orders.
8739711	8742793	If they didn't get so many pre-orders on the official website, they weren't going to make the game.
8743453	8744594	It was so dumb.
8746615	8748837	The way they were just teasing us.
8749417	8750198	I guess it worked.
8750478	8751679	The game eventually came out.
8752259	8754821	and it's been doing very good ever since, at least in Japan, of course.
8755621	8756722	So is that what they need to do here?
8756802	8759604	If they're going to release another Beatmania game here, force 10,000 people to pre-order?
8759624	8760444	No, it's not going to happen.
8761905	8772692	It's too weird and the DJ culture is, while there are, of course, a lot of DJs, music performers and whatnot, it just doesn't have the same... I don't even know what the word is that I'm looking for.
8772872	8777095	It's not American in the sense that it's not going to take off like that.
8777595	8779156	I mean, Rock Band is traditional.
8779217	8779597	That is...
8780904	8782646	I'm completely and totally screwing this up
8800390	8800971	That's part of it.
8801471	8806316	And just the manner of playing the games, how the games are played is just too different.
8806776	8810500	I mean, Poppin' Music and 2DX are very out there.
8810660	8816845	Even people who would understand what the concept of a DJ is is not going to pick up on 2DX immediately.
8817086	8820109	And you know us, and if I can't do it now, I'm not going to do it.
8820990	8830917	By us I mean typical people who ADHD, run through arcades, play something and then never again unless it actually gave them something special or something along those lines.
8831917	8833378	So why Rock Revolution?
8834899	8836080	Why did Konami do this?
8836200	8846507	Because Konami is in America, because Konami is supposed to be the name, game, and face of music games, and because they have to exert their fantabulousness and it's not going to work.
8848743	8857636	Why embarrass themselves with this game when they could explore a new idea in the music game world?
8858017	8859379	Why go through this embarrassment?
8859839	8862644	Because they tried new in America and it didn't work.
8863144	8863945	That was Beatmania.
8864305	8865826	They're trying new in America.
8865946	8866847	That's beat and groovy.
8867047	8868307	It's not gonna work.
8868708	8870369	So they're trying what was popular.
8870529	8871790	Rock band, guitar hero.
8872050	8873071	Let's bring a guitar game.
8873351	8876052	But the unfortunate thing is, it's not gonna work.
8876293	8877714	Comparatively speaking, of course.
8878974	8880515	What about what Bobby's saying in chat right now?
8880555	8882657	They're only doing it for the patent lawsuit against MTV.
8884146	8886427	A lot of people say that's the only reason why Supernova came out.
8887088	8894432	I'm half tempted to believe them just because Supernova, the interface and all things associated was done pretty horribly by comparison.
8894912	8897874	I said this three years ago until I was blue in the face and I say it again now.
8897934	8902196	The reason why In The Groove got smacked down is because they dared to enter the home console.
8902616	8905718	If they had never done that, we'd still have In The Groove arcade machines today.
8906718	8908599	Mark my words.
8908980	8909560	Mark my words.
8909900	8914903	If they had just kept it in their pants and not tried to invade the whole market, this would have never happened.
8915283	8918105	I'd like to mark your words, but I don't have a time machine.
8918125	8918525	I'm sorry.
8919105	8919866	We are not great.
8919906	8921567	We cannot hold the button and go backwards.
8922307	8922507	Yeah.
8922707	8923128	Fair enough.
8923408	8925149	All right, Jason, we've got to go soon and wrap up the show.
8925189	8925869	Any final thoughts?
8926489	8927950	No, don't leave me.
8928210	8929091	No.
8929531	8930051	We'll be back.
8930071	8930612	Okay, bye.
8930652	8931132	Okay, all right.
8931152	8931953	See you later, Jason.
8932033	8932313	Bye.
8932333	8932573	Bye, guys.
8934225	8936447	Alright, we always like hearing from the long time Imani fans.
8937147	8942551	Sorry for those who didn't get through tonight, but we gotta get out of here, wrap things up, but not before we get some last minute stories.
8942891	8944532	DarkSakura, you got anything for us tonight?
8945253	8946093	I know I do not.
8946373	8948155	What, who, when, blah.
8948395	8948735	Exactly.
8948835	8949736	Oh yeah, actually the ferret does.
8952426	8953927	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories tonight?
8953947	8954248	Yeah, I had time.
8954268	8955008	I said you had something earlier.
8955389	8956189	I got time.
8956330	8956870	Make it quick.
8957270	8958191	I'll try to.
8959853	8961914	Anyway, let's get started here.
8963996	8966298	Apparently, Sony thinks that...
8968703	8970284	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8991398	8994481	Why they're spreading those kinds of rumors, they will never know.
8995361	9001186	Um, Mega Man Star Force 3 got announced at apparently the Mega Man Festival that was going on.
9001266	9003688	Yes, there was a Mega Man Festival going on.
9004308	9010293	And it will be coming out in two different flavors, Black Ace and Red Joker.
9011234	9012615	Going for the card theme there.
9013736	9013816	Um,
9015020	9029229	Conduit is supposed to be shown at PAX, and they're going to be shown off at Nintendo's booth, which is kind of interesting, making you wonder, possibly, could Nintendo be publishing that game?
9029750	9030490	That would make sense.
9030990	9033952	I would hope that they would do that, but who knows.
9035433	9039876	Because right now they're saying that they still don't have a publisher, but that could be an announcement.
9039916	9040396	You never know.
9040416	9042598	Let's see here.
9044701	9045763	Thanks for watching!
9054526	9055506	Exploit, I should say.
9055926	9058787	It's being done kind of strangely.
9059067	9072090	You have to have two hard drives for the PS3, and it will allow you to run any game as long as you have a PlayStation 3 game in the disk drive.
9072210	9081292	So I'm not sure how that's going to work, but they do have kind of a video showing it being done, and I don't know.
9084793	9095474	The Last Guy is coming out on August 28th on the PlayStation Network, so that should be pretty cool.
9095514	9095955	It's only about $10.
9099755	9103776	Disaster Day and Crisis may actually be coming out eventually.
9104436	9108777	Apparently, the Australian version of the ESRB has raided the game.
9110015	9112537	So maybe it's not disappeared after all.
9113158	9113798	That's kind of cool.
9117822	9128731	Also, not to be outdone by the iPets, Nintendo is going to be getting Monkey Madness on the Wii, which is a monkey pet sim.
9129571	9130933	So you can play with your monkey.
9132994	9139075	Canami showed off a new game at Leipzig that's not scheduled to come out until 2010.
9139735	9156538	It is a game called Lords of Shadow and kind of looks a little bit like a next-gen Castlevania because it has the main character Gabriel, who sort of looks like he could be a Belmont, fighting off some sort of monster with a flaming chain whip.
9157359	9159799	And if that doesn't scream Castlevania, I don't know what will.
9162108	9167089	and those bastards in the UK have gotten Super Mario RPG on the virtual console.
9167129	9167669	Bastards!
9167889	9168569	I am angry.
9169670	9177711	But it's part of the new Hanabi Festival which they will be getting a bunch of Japanese only games.
9178051	9179872	Hopefully that will be coming over here as well.
9180172	9186533	The other thing they're going to be getting is the real Mario 2 or Mario The Lost Levels as it was called over here.
9187794	9190196	Our Harmonix is teasing their next music game.
9190957	9192459	They haven't really said what it is.
9192679	9195181	I talked about this at the end of Part A. Oh, never mind.
9196803	9197423	Never mind.
9198604	9199946	Fable 2, the pub games.
9199986	9203289	There was an exploit in there where you can cheat and get lots of gold.
9203669	9205491	Well, they're going to be fixing that.
9205631	9210436	So if you want to still cheat, you'll just have to play it offline so it doesn't patch.
9213393	9216036	I haven't got a chance to play it yet, but I downloaded it.
9216516	9220901	Apparently Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be having some interesting modes for the Wii.
9221581	9228208	You're going to be able to put your Miis in there and play Mii Freestyle, which is kind of like Wii Music a little bit.
9229109	9234435	That's kind of interesting because Guitar Hero World Tour will actually be coming out before Wii Music does.
9236758	9237759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9260548	9263751	Rock the Vote is going to be canvassing Xbox Live.
9264571	9265372	That's kind of dumb.
9267254	9273680	Alone in the Dark, the PS3 version, which is coming out in November, is going to be getting a whole bunch of patches to fix all the problems in the game.
9274060	9280045	Well, thankfully, if you bought a version of the Xbox 360 version of Alone in the Dark...
9281266	9288810	You will also be getting those same patches that will be coming with a downloadable patch probably around the time of the PS3 game.
9289390	9295473	So, if you have the game that long, well then, it'll be fixed.
9296894	9300075	We talked a little bit about PS3 SKUs and stuff like that.
9300496	9309160	There are some new announced SKUs for the UK, including a 160GB PlayStation 3 SKU with Uncharted and Pain.
9309890	9311693	DualShock 3 for $4.99.
9311793	9318121	That is going to be replacing the 80GB system that's currently available right now with Metal Gear Solid 4.
9321043	9324805	and finally, the last thing, Red Alert 3.
9324925	9333731	They announced the cast for the game and I gotta say it's got a lot of pretty awesome people there.
9333771	9348139	Everybody from Jenny McCarthy to Tim Curry to Kelly Hugh to George Takei and just a whole bunch of people.
9348579	9349760	So it'll be really funny.
9352708	9352968	All right.
9353368	9354549	That's it for last-minute stories?
9355149	9355609	One last one.
9355709	9356510	Oh, Jesus.
9356570	9357310	Sorry, sorry.
9357610	9358010	One last one.
9358390	9359511	I thought this was interesting.
9360131	9369154	Apparently, someone found a glitch in Tiger Woods 08 that would allow Tiger Woods to basically walk on water and hit a ball from on top of a lake.
9369695	9380579	Well, in response to that, EA decided to put out a viral video of Tiger Woods walking on water and hitting a golf ball off the water because apparently he's Jesus.
9383681	9384182	Okay.
9386123	9388726	Completely off topic, Rob, for Christmas.
9389286	9389466	Yes.
9389827	9392749	I want a Bluetooth LED keyboard.
9393931	9394511	Good luck with that.
9395172	9395412	Thank you.
9395452	9396153	And I want a pony.
9396973	9397674	I can eat a pony.
9397954	9398955	I don't really want a pony.
9399536	9400937	All right, we're going to wrap up the show.
9400977	9404200	It's time for us to get out of here, but not before we get everybody's final thought.
9404701	9405501	Loki, your final thought.
9406742	9409365	My final thought is PAX.
9411161	9415065	My final thought is pie, DarkSakura.
9418735	9423018	Alright, thank you guys so much for downloading us and listening to us and supporting independent podcasting.
9423058	9431205	Remember, if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show and help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio or leave us a nice review on iTunes like a couple people did this week.
9431245	9435748	Thank you to you guys that left nice reviews on iTunes or any other podcasting website.
9435788	9436589	Help spread the word.
9436889	9439771	We don't have any fancy magazines or commercialized things to back us.
9440111	9441553	We do this out of love.
9442153	9442433	Heart.
9442834	9447317	So we will see you next week at Penny Arcade Expo and back here in the OLR studios in two weeks.
9447417	9448018	Until then...
9448718	9450479	See you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9467384	9469905	or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
