0	3000	BORGE LOUGE RADIO
7000	13000	Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Roto!
14000	19000	Tonight, August 24th, 2008, the Guitar Hero be adding yet another instrument to the mix,
20000	26000	Sony announces the iPad, and rumors of an Xbox motion controller begin to circulate yet again.
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	41000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	49000	We missed you last week, our aim is improving though, isn't it Dark Sakura? Jamie Summers, lovely co-host of OLR.
49000	59000	Splaat! And speaking of shooting things, say hello to Tech Master Loki, who apparently spent this morning shooting people in the face.
60000	65000	Yes. And getting shot in the face. I went and played Airsoft, it's a new hobby I'm getting into now.
66000	68000	Nice. What's Airsoft for the uninitiated?
69000	76000	Airsoft is kind of like paintball, but instead of actually shooting balls of paint at people, you have kind of like souped up BB guns that shoot plastic pellets at people.
76000	78000	And actually it doesn't hurt at all.
79000	81000	So you're not shooting balls at people's face?
82000	83000	We are shooting balls at people's face.
84000	84000	I'm not going to judge.
85000	86000	Tiny little white balls.
87000	87000	Okay.
88000	89000	Depending on their color BBs.
90000	94000	Alright. But did you win or did you lose?
95000	96000	Actually we won three.
97000	99000	How does one win or lose? Just don't get shot? You win?
100000	102000	No, because we had different scenarios for each one we played.
102000	110000	The first game we played was you had to occupy, there was like a, they call them kill houses, they were basically little structures that they built.
111000	116000	And the first game you had to be the team that's occupying that at the end of the 30 minute match.
117000	121000	And then the second game that I sat out on was a capture the flag game.
122000	127000	And then the third game we came back, it was also kind of capture the flag, but basically capturing a sniper post.
127000	131000	And you'd get the flag and raise it and wave it in the air.
132000	138000	And then the last game was just played on the field sideways and was basically just kill the other team.
139000	143000	And it's kind of cool though because it's like a video game because you get different respawns.
144000	149000	So if you get shot you have to go back to this one spot and when three people get there you all respawn and stuff like that.
150000	153000	Wow, they actually say respawns. Are there video games based on this out of curiosity?
154000	154000	No.
154000	158000	Not like dodge ball video games? No, no airsoft games. Tons of paintball games but no airsoft.
159000	163000	The ever present fourth co-host on our show, you through the chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
164000	167000	And poor Leno in chat says airsoft rocks. Airsoft rocks.
168000	174000	It's pretty fun. I have a, I bought a P90 which is like the Stargate machine gun type thing.
175000	181000	Not because I like Stargate, because I don't, but just because it looks neat and it's shot well.
181000	187000	And then I have a sidearm as well so I was playing the entire game with a sidearm and you know the P90.
188000	195000	And actually at one point I charged at people with the P90 in one hand because you can fire it with one hand and then the sidearm and I got shot.
196000	197000	But it was still fun.
198000	201000	Dark Dead Studios says wow, OLR is getting violent. I know lots of gun talk tonight.
202000	204000	It's OLR and gun night. It's gun show night on OLR.
205000	206000	Did I tell you that I'm going to be, that I've got a rifle?
207000	209000	Oh my gosh, too many guns.
209000	214000	No, I have a.22 caliber rifle. Dan's going to take me out shooting, but I told him that I wanted my own handgun.
215000	219000	That's one thing I have no interest in, unless it's a laser gun. Laser guns are alright.
220000	231000	Well, there was a very good point made, that if everybody in the country could have a concealed weapon on them, even if they did or didn't, do you think someone's going to be likely to attack someone who could be armed?
232000	236000	You know I'm still not a gun fan, but we're not going to talk politics tonight because we've got games to talk about.
236000	238000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
239000	247000	It was Ragnarok-tastic, and I also played Final Fantasy 6 while I had jury duty last week.
248000	249000	Now you know, I don't think there's guns in Ragnarok.
250000	251000	Yes there are.
252000	256000	There's a gunslinger class. You could even have a humongous gatling gun. It's freaking sexy.
257000	262000	My favorite class in Final Fantasy 11 since you brought up Final Fantasy was Corsair, and they used guns, and that was pretty cool.
263000	264000	Guns are fun in video games.
264000	265000	Pirates like guns.
266000	267000	Anyhow, sorry, Final Fantasy 6, yes.
268000	280000	So I played some of that while I had jury duty, and I was very pissed off that I was one alternate away from getting on the trial, and it was like a little three day criminal trial, and I was looking forward to it.
281000	285000	So I didn't get on the trial, disappointment, blah blah, cry cry, wham.
286000	290000	Aw, you don't get to do your civic duty. Well I mean, you kind of did, but you know what I mean.
290000	297000	Yeah, but I met some cool people and watched the Olympics, which was kind of eh.
298000	303000	And then really that's about all I played, except for playing a lot of solitaire on my iPhone.
304000	311000	Do you have Michael Phelps fever? I know this has nothing to do with video games, but at the same time he'll probably have a game or something named after him in the future.
311000	319000	I do not, but I did go looking at pictures on the interwebs today of people kissing during the Olympics, and there was a guy kissing his horse.
320000	323000	What? What the? Okay!
324000	339000	There was like people kissing their medals, and you know, like couples kissing, you know, and there actually, I was looking at the marksman competition, and there was a wife who won the gold, and her husband won the silver in one of the marksman competitions.
339000	344000	But they were actually really cute. You would be watching the marksman competitions.
345000	356000	Well, so I like guns, and I especially think it was hilarious that, you know, the last time there was the guy who shot the wrong target that was further away than the target he was supposed to do and hit it perfectly.
357000	362000	I just want to warn you all tonight in chat room, don't piss Jamie off tonight, she's prepared.
362000	368000	Oh, I'm armed and dangerous. I've got two of them.
369000	370000	I'm armed and fabulous.
371000	377000	That has, you know, not the sunnies, I have the patella. I have my humerus and my radius.
378000	382000	Alright. Low-key, tell us something about your gaming...
383000	384000	My biceps break your eye too.
385000	386000	That doesn't involve guns or Michael Phelps.
386000	391000	Well, I can guarantee one of the two of those. Michael Phelps sucks.
392000	395000	And I hope to God they don't make a game, because really, how exciting...
396000	398000	You can send that hate mail to lokioworangelaunchradio.com
399000	403000	How exciting could a game be that's all swimming? I mean...
404000	405000	Wii Sports 2, I thought.
406000	407000	Swimming in Wii Sports 2, wait for it.
407000	415000	The Olympic games are boring enough, you know, not the game as in the actual Olympics, but the games made about the Olympics.
416000	421000	Those are boring. And let alone just, you know, cutting out all the other events that you might find exciting and just leaving swimming in there.
422000	427000	See, call me sick, but the things I like about the Olympics, I don't really like the dream stories about like Michael Phelps.
428000	431000	I mean, yeah, great swimmer and all, I'm not going to knock him, but that's the stuff that's boring to me.
431000	440000	I like the crazy stuff, like the craziness that happens in the Olympics, like the weightlifter who had to get the paramedics stalled in on him.
441000	446000	And Frisbee in chat says, who saw the Cuban guy get mad and kick the ref? That's the kind of stuff I love about the Olympics.
447000	449000	Or the guy that bit that guy in the shoulder, the boxer.
450000	452000	The Jerry Springer stuff you won't see on NBC, yes.
453000	456000	Do you have Blue on your friends list on LiveJournal?
457000	458000	No, sadly I do not.
458000	467000	He posted a translation of an article that I thought was a really sweet article, and I want to mention it real quick, about the South Korean women's handball team.
468000	477000	Right, because they were already ahead, they were going to win the bronze, but their coach pulled out, called a timeout right before, and put in all the old players.
477000	487000	The ones that were, not old, but older players, that used to be their last Olympics, so that they could be in the winning match, and all be the ones to take home the medal.
488000	490000	Because they wouldn't be able to do another Olympics.
491000	502000	And some of them were housewives, and their children were watching, and so he put like I think four people that would have to retire after this Olympics in the match for the last few minutes of the game.
503000	504000	I'd be fucking pissed.
504000	511000	Why is it that all Olympic video games usually suck? Like I don't remember playing an Olympics video game thinking, wow that was awesome. You know what I mean?
512000	514000	Because none of the crazy stuff happens in the video game.
515000	520000	I think that's a darn good explanation. We don't get that crazy stuff happening. We need more craziness.
521000	527000	And whoever's developing London 2012 for next gen consoles, make it happen. Give us the crazy.
528000	529000	Alright, I'm sorry. Gaming week, my bad.
529000	534000	Anyways, um, well the games I play, sorry.
535000	540000	JoeShe16 says someone should put Michael Phelps in place of Echo the Dolphin. That would be cool.
541000	542000	That would be cool, I'd play that.
543000	545000	Phelps the Dolphin, exactly, Frisbee. Alright, sorry.
546000	547000	Chat.orangelandradio.com if you want to join this.
548000	549000	Michael the Phelps.
549000	562000	Okay. Um, so I play basically Bionic Commando Rearmed, which is awesome and I love Bionic Commando. So, you know, pretty much the game is as frustrating as the original, which is fine.
563000	565000	And, I don't know, I enjoy it quite a bit.
565000	579000	And then, I played more Grand Theft Auto IV, because that's what I do, and I just have to address this because I have had a lot of people sending me requests to play with them for, you know, different games.
580000	588000	Listen, if I'm at work, if it's during the day, yes I'm online playing, you know, Grand Theft Auto twice a day or possibly three times a day depending on lunch.
588000	601000	Um, but I'm not going to play with you during those times because I have other people playing with me. I have five other people that play, and I've tried to get other people in there, but they don't want outside people playing, so, sorry.
602000	603000	But, I don't know.
604000	605000	You need to set up certain hours.
606000	615000	Exactly. And, you know, I'm not trying to be rude and I would love to type back to you, but I'm limited on time and typing on the fucking, you know, Xbox controller sucks.
615000	617000	So, I don't know.
618000	620000	You need to get it to light up USB keyboard like mine for the 360.
621000	627000	I have the chat pad. I have it at home, but I just, you know, I don't have it at work. And I don't have a headset at work either, so I can't, you know, tell you no.
628000	639000	But, um, I don't know. Other than that, um, I meant to download Galaga Legions because that looked kind of cool, but I never did. So, I'm just not going to.
639000	647000	I am highly looking forward to this week, though, with the release of Castle Crashers. Oh my god, it's going to be awesome.
648000	649000	So, that's what I'll be playing.
650000	656000	I hope you're not pumping something up for disappointment. That's why I have no feelings whatsoever about Castle Crashers.
657000	662000	Well, Alien Hominid is pretty awesome, and Castle Crashers, just all the video looks freaking awesome.
662000	669000	Alright, I've got to say this, even though this was sent over a private message, and I usually don't encourage people to send me chat comments over a private message because it's a bit overwhelming.
670000	677000	This is pretty funny. Tigerclaw, going on the Olympic thing, said, what about the one female water polo player who had her breasts exposed all over the net?
678000	679000	That's another good example of the dark side.
680000	683000	How did I miss that? Oh, I know, because it's water polo, and I would never watch it.
684000	688000	But I'm thinking, you know, I could go for some boobs in my Olympic games. Yes, Dark Sakura?
689000	690000	I'm looking on the internet right now.
690000	696000	Here's what we were talking about, because, you know, obviously when we were watching the Olympics, you know, you have to heckle it because it's fun.
697000	703000	But we were watching men's diving, and I was like, wouldn't it be awesome if, now, that's a sport I'll watch.
704000	711000	Wouldn't it be awesome if those diving boards have, like, some sort of pneumatic thing on them that launched them into the air really high?
712000	717000	I mean, that would be fucking awesome. They're doing, like, you know, ten somersaults in the air and stuff. I mean, come on.
717000	725000	Who wouldn't watch that? And then they have BMX bike racing in this Olympics. That's not really an Olympic sport.
726000	735000	Or a little Benny Hill-style gag that when the divers dive off the board, there's like a little device, like a little hook or something that just rips their swimsuit right off as they're falling.
736000	740000	Men and women, you know, for everybody, you know. And then the music plays.
741000	743000	Ah, forget it.
743000	753000	I did think it's kind of cool, though, that when they're doing, like, the whitewater rafting event or something like that, I'm like, that's pretty cool. It's like having that, you know, water ride from, like, Great America in there.
754000	757000	Gsquared68 asks if you're talking about the man cannon from Halo.
758000	760000	Exactly. That's what they need to have, a man cannon.
761000	762000	That should be an Olympic event, man cannon.
763000	764000	Man cannon? I like that. Hey.
765000	767000	And woman cannon. You know, man and women.
768000	771000	I smell a new list, or not list list, or something like that.
771000	772000	A new dream game?
773000	774000	Not a dream game, but just like, you know.
775000	777000	It's an expansion upon the dream games. It's an Olympic event.
778000	780000	No, a list list. The Olympic events that you'd want to see.
781000	783000	Oh, we might have to do that in the near future.
784000	789000	Maybe we can convince Bobby to do a live list list at PAX somehow when we're there for the panel, which we'll talk more about in a little while.
790000	793000	Moving on, though, anything else in your gaming week you want to share, Logie?
794000	795000	That's all that I remember.
795000	800000	Alright, I actually haven't played a lot new this week. I had a very busy personal life this week.
801000	808000	And I don't feel right basing reviews off demos alone, but I will say I did at least play the demos for Force Unleashed, which I enjoyed.
809000	813000	I have some reservations about the full game, but I'll check out the full game and see if that carries over.
814000	818000	But I enjoyed myself more than I thought I would for a 3D action game, which usually isn't my kind of thing.
818000	828000	I'm not even that into Star Wars either, but I liked the apprentice guy, a Starkiller or whatever his name is in Soul Calibur, and I thought, ah, what the hell, I'll check out Force Unleashed. It might be fun.
829000	831000	It's interesting. Very interesting.
832000	836000	I also checked out the new Galaga game on Xbox Live, the Galaga Legion, the new souped up one.
837000	842000	I had a lot of fun with the demo for that one. I probably will end up upgrading to the full version and tell you more about it later.
842000	850000	But I was very pleased that it's much faster paced than the old Galaga, because it's really hard to go back and play the old 80's Galaga these days.
851000	862000	I mean, no disrespect to a true classic game that brought us so many, inspired so many other great space games, but it's nice to have something very fast paced and competitive for a shooter.
863000	866000	I don't know Dark Soccer, if you haven't checked out Galaga Legion yet, I think this is a game you'd really enjoy.
867000	868000	What did you think?
869000	870000	Flashy. Very flashy.
870000	874000	Yeah, well the other big game that's been going on in our house was Bionic Commando.
875000	877000	Alright, I checked that out too, I did download that.
878000	881000	I haven't played enough of it yet, I don't want to review it yet, but I'm having fun with it.
882000	886000	And I really enjoyed the new soundtrack, I gotta say. Very happy with that.
887000	890000	Ryoma in chat says, I destroy a Galaga. Awesome.
891000	897000	Alright, Dark Tetsuya says, and now representing the USA in the 1000 meter man cannon, Rob Roberts.
897000	900000	Love it.
901000	906000	Gerardimo in chat says, Pac-Man Championship Edition is to Pac-Man as Galaga Legion is to R-Type.
907000	912000	Yeah, it's kind of true, the Galaga Legion isn't really a lot like Galaga at all, actually.
913000	915000	But it's fun. I had a really good time playing it.
916000	920000	I was thinking it was going to be too much like Geometry Wars, and we just had that a few weeks ago, but it's different enough.
921000	922000	It's different enough.
922000	926000	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, and of course the big thing on all of our minds,
927000	929000	Penny Arcade Expo is next week, it's going to be awesome.
930000	934000	Sadly there will be no live Orange Lounge radio next week, because we're going to be on a plane coming back,
935000	937000	but you know what, you're going to have plenty to hold you over.
938000	941000	Not only are we going to be a part of the live coverage with AllGames.com,
942000	946000	they're doing some live stuff every day starting at 4 Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern.
947000	949000	They're doing coverage Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from the floor.
949000	953000	We're going to be a part of that. We won't be there the whole time, but we will definitely be dropping in and spending a good chunk of time with them.
954000	956000	Especially if he has Nintendo on, because I have to heckle them.
957000	961000	Alright, but we'll also be doing our own stuff, and we haven't exactly decided what we're doing.
962000	966000	I know there will be video involved to some extent, because we'll want to shoot some video from the floor,
967000	971000	so we'll be showing you some things via our YouTube channel, and giving you updates via our brand new Twitter,
972000	975000	which I also wanted to mention. We have a brand new Twitter at Twitter.com.
975000	980000	The username, very easy, O-L-R is our Twitter name. So follow us on Twitter, we'll be giving you updates from the floor,
981000	986000	letting you know what to expect, and a couple podcasts from PAX as well. It'll be fun!
987000	991000	Are you guys getting excited about PAX? What are you guys most looking forward to at PAX?
994000	999000	For me, the networking. I can't wait to meet other podcasters, because a whole crap load of them are going to be there.
999000	1004000	Not just in the All Games Network, but other indie podcasters. I'm looking forward to the networking.
1005000	1008000	I want to see which celebrity I bump into this year. Like at E3.
1009000	1010000	Alright, Loki?
1011000	1014000	I need to smack Konami upside their head, because seriously, I don't know what they're doing.
1015000	1016000	They're not showing at PAX.
1017000	1020000	Well good! We don't have anything to show.
1020000	1028000	Alright, if you guys want to meet us, we'll be around the show floor, and most certainly at the All Games broadcast going on right by the Sumo Lounge.
1029000	1034000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on and talk about, I plugged the Twitter, I plugged Penny Arcade Expo.
1035000	1038000	We'll be playing a promo for the Penny Arcade Expo coverage tonight during our free break.
1039000	1044000	Stay tuned for that right after party is over, but for now, news! Loki, start us off tonight.
1044000	1055000	Anyways, I'm sure everyone's seen the information about the Space Invaders meets 9-11 art exhibit that was at Leipzig.
1056000	1061000	It's basically kind of a homemade version of the game, attacking the Twin Towers.
1062000	1070000	And it has some sort of interactive elements with it where people can actually put their hand over this railing that's near the exhibit.
1070000	1074000	And it will fire bullets up at the screen, killing the Space Invaders.
1075000	1081000	But, you know, it's pretty much impossible to win, so the towers always get destroyed.
1082000	1085000	And apparently people, you know, are like, too soon! Too soon!
1086000	1090000	So, I don't know. It's interesting.
1090000	1101000	It's basically the game's convention press release calls the installation an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy,
1102000	1108000	and a social tale that can be related to historical tales without losing its poetic power.
1109000	1111000	Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.
1112000	1114000	Sounds like art fluff. Artsy speak.
1114000	1120000	I, you know, I don't know. I will give you my opinion here in just a second, but there's some more.
1121000	1132000	So, because this happened, of course the news got back to Taito, who responded by saying that they had no idea that this sort of thing was going on,
1133000	1137000	and of course they obviously did not license Space Invaders for them to use,
1137000	1146000	and they're going to take legal actions against the person who infringed upon their trademark.
1147000	1150000	Uh oh. But then what happened, Loki?
1151000	1156000	But then, the artist who put it up there decided to pull it.
1156000	1171000	And basically, you know, after three days of steady downward spiral in the public discussion of the piece, I have just given my agreement to the organizers of Leipzig Games Convention to simply turn off the installation invaders.
1172000	1176000	You had quite the little manifesto posted. I mean, it was a manifesto.
1176000	1192000	Yeah, it was all contrary to previous reports. I am American, and it saddens me that people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside some obscure but tactically understood criteria of purely,
1193000	1198000	let's see, I have no idea what the hell he's trying to say here.
1199000	1200000	Eh, whatever. Anyways.
1201000	1203000	Uh, it's fancy talk.
1203000	1205000	Fancy, what do you think? Fancy talk. Anyways.
1206000	1212000	So, I think it's retarded that they took it out, because you can interpret it in many ways.
1213000	1223000	One, you can interpret it as, I think, based on the fact that people can interact with it and actually fire bullets from the bottom of the screen,
1223000	1233000	it's kind of invoking, like, togetherness. Basically, you have to, people have to come together if they want to overcome this great evil type thing.
1234000	1236000	So you would need, you know, a lot more people firing bullets.
1237000	1242000	You of all people, I never pegged for interpreting art in strange, mysterious ways. Very interesting, though.
1243000	1245000	I have an interpretation of the reaction.
1246000	1251000	DarkSakura, I know you have strong opinions on this, because I heard you on Bobby's show, I see you type it in the chat now, what do you think?
1251000	1253000	People need to learn to be offended.
1254000	1258000	Stop being a goddamn whiny bitch, get the stick out of your ass and deal with it.
1259000	1262000	That's the end of the story. I'm sorry, you don't like it, boo-fucking-who, okay?
1263000	1265000	I don't like having to go to work, but guess what, I gotta.
1266000	1272000	I don't like hearing, you know, my husband yell at playing Grand Theft Auto 4, but guess what, I gotta.
1272000	1281000	I married him, it's my choice. You know, you, if you want to live in a country where you've got free speech, stay in America.
1282000	1288000	You've got it, may as well flaunt it. If you don't want your free speech, by all means, move to North Korea or something.
1289000	1299000	You know, but, if you, I think that if you want to be free to express your freedom of speech, you also need to let other people be free to express theirs.
1299000	1303000	If you do not like it, shut the fuck up, that's what your blog is for.
1304000	1312000	Or maybe if you didn't like it, and you just probably didn't understand the piece, and maybe if you asked the artist what he meant by it, there you go.
1313000	1321000	But then again, at the same time, at the same time though, I kind of get from this, you know, artist or whatever, he was just trying to invoke a reaction.
1322000	1323000	I'm sorry, that's not an excuse for art.
1323000	1329000	No, that's what art is to be for. If you do a piece, and no one reacts to it, you have failed as an artist.
1330000	1334000	But I don't think that just making an artistic piece just to get a reaction is considered art.
1335000	1345000	Because, I mean, if you think about it, if I paint a painting that I want people to think is sad, you know, and if I invoke a sad reaction, then yes, mission accomplished for me.
1345000	1352000	But, if, you know, I paint a painting that's just, you know, offensive, and people get offended by it, I don't know.
1353000	1361000	That was your purpose. That's why you did the art. But the whole thing is that if people's comfort zones are not pushed, if people are not challenged to think, they're not going to.
1362000	1372000	It's gonna, you know, cause a very stagnant society. I mean, even think about, you know, some of the greatest artists of their time were so unappreciated in their time, told that their work was crap.
1372000	1381000	Yet, you know, years after they've died, they're now considered masterpieces. They're considered the, you know, geniuses of their age, the innovators.
1382000	1388000	If we didn't have people that challenged the way that people think, then there would be, I think, no cultural progression. That's what this is about.
1389000	1393000	I think the problem comes down to that it's space invaders and not geometry wars.
1393000	1401000	Look, I have an opinion on this too, which is, I kind of like mostly agree. Here's my thing, I mostly agree.
1402000	1409000	Because I'm all for free speech, that's this country we live in, this guy has a right to do, even though he's exhibiting in Germany, you know, whatever.
1409000	1423000	I still support he has a right to say what he wants to say. I personally may go, that wasn't very smart, and I might go, well, the price you pay for expression is people disagreeing with you and going to be expressing their opinion in return.
1424000	1433000	That's kind of part of it, you know, a little bit of, if you open yourself up for that with your art, then you're going to get it back at you.
1434000	1436000	But here's the thing, I actually understand why Taito's pissed.
1436000	1445000	Well, now I agree, pulling it because of the licensing issue, I agree with that. He did use their licensed material without permission.
1446000	1463000	Right, and here's the thing, it's not so much that I think Taito had a right to do it because of what is going on, but because people are so ignorant when they see this, they are going to think, oh, Taito or space invaders endorse this, or this is a gamer thing where gamers just want to pretend to blow up the train.
1463000	1472000	You know all this ignorant crap that's out there in the media about video games, that people like Jack Voldemort just perpetuate, you know, this whole thing.
1473000	1486000	So I understand why Taito's pissed, and I think the guy made a bad judgment in that regard where maybe he should have done something similar yet different, you know what I mean, if he was going to invoke such emotions.
1486000	1495000	Parity is legal. Parity is legal. If we didn't have parity being legal, we would have no Jonathan Coulton or Weird Al. End of story.
1496000	1509000	But I also, I think that he should have been a little, especially as an artist, he should have recognized the difference between, you know, stealing somebody else's intellectual property and done something.
1509000	1520000	He could have used the concept, I mean, how many video games do we have out there with, you know, aliens invading Earth, shoot. Die, aliens, bang bang. No, we've got a ton of games of those, so it wouldn't be any type of problem.
1521000	1533000	Well, I'm offended. You know why I'm offended? Because I love aliens, and aliens are creatures too. Aliens are creatures of the great god of the universe, and I'm offended by these games where we just haphazardly kill aliens who only come in peace.
1534000	1536000	You want to hear something really ironic about this whole story?
1536000	1538000	What? And that I'm sure that they didn't realize?
1539000	1548000	What? Next week on the Japanese WiiWare service, Space Invaders Get Even will be released.
1549000	1550000	That is great.
1551000	1554000	You know, where the Space Invaders will destroy buildings.
1555000	1556000	It's like Rampage with aliens, that's great.
1556000	1567000	But here's the thing, I bet you there are tons of paintings out there that depict the events of 9-11, a horrific tragedy in American times in very controversial ways.
1568000	1578000	I bet there are tons of paintings out there and books and newspapers and movies that, but the funny thing is, the media is never going to show that to you because they love to pick on video games.
1579000	1580000	That's why Taito's pissed.
1580000	1586000	It's all whatever is, you know, going to cause the biggest stir. It's already a hot topic right now.
1587000	1600000	So, of course since, you know, basically since He Who Shall Not Be Named is getting disbarred, and basically having all of his arguments disproven in a public forum, they've got to find something else to keep that topic alive, right?
1600000	1610000	Sharon in chat says, I'm offended by games where you kill monsters. I know plenty of monsters and they're not all like that. It's an unfair stereotype. I'm a monster activist, hear me roar.
1611000	1622000	Hey look, we have a new segment on our show. It's involving our new Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR and we invite you guys to respond to one story every week before we go live.
1623000	1627000	That way if you're not going to be here for the live show, you still have a chance to interact with us and we asked listeners tonight what they thought about this story.
1627000	1632000	GS68 on Twitter says, blaming terrorism on video games or inevitable destruction of civilization?
1633000	1637000	ActDeaf says, well if 9-11 wouldn't happen, this wouldn't even be catching the media's attention.
1638000	1641000	Offensive, kind of, but there have been other stuff that have also done this.
1642000	1651000	I don't, see for me, I'm like, you can't really, for me, I mean I respect what you're saying dude, but like 9-11 did happen. That's just something we all kind of like have to deal with.
1652000	1655000	You know what I mean? I don't know. It's a weird statement to me.
1655000	1659000	PodCulture says, a bit too soon for stuff like that.
1660000	1668000	Justin says, I think it was pretty tasteless and the guy was obviously going for press via controversy despite his insistence that he wasn't.
1669000	1675000	AlphaCananagram says, I think that it was a risky move by the artist. He must have known that he would piss people off, but he has the right to show it. Yum.
1675000	1684000	Darktacuya says, I don't blame Taito for wanting to distance themselves from something so controversial. Talk about bad PR. Exactly what I'm saying yo.
1685000	1691000	And Rama, as a New Yorker that lives here and works two blocks from ground zero, it doesn't bother me, really. Some people need to get their heads out of their asses.
1692000	1695000	There you go. Comments from our Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.
1695000	1708000	I just remember reading just how, you know, in fact, I honestly think that the biggest, you know, if people are so worried about, you know, recovery and about moving past it, then that's what they actually need to be doing.
1709000	1712000	You know, recovering, moving past it, business as usual.
1713000	1719000	Kind of the ideas of people who laugh at funerals. Yeah. You know, because sometimes that's the best way to deal with it is to laugh at it.
1719000	1735000	And forgive me for being a little philosophical about this, but if their whole point of, you know, running airplanes into the buildings was to shake our, you know, our morale and to weaken us, wouldn't the biggest slap in their face back would be to go back to business as usual?
1736000	1741000	We welcome your comments. Mailbag OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have further comments on the issue.
1741000	1749000	All right. And I'm sure there's a lot of people with very differing opinions on that. Let's get to some more gaming news tonight, though. And we're going to talk a lot about music games.
1750000	1754000	And, you know, this game will not be coming to Xbox Live, this whole Space Invaders controversial thing.
1755000	1765000	But guess what is? A very interesting report coming from BamaniStyle.com. They got the pictures to prove it. There's a new game coming out. It's called Beat and Groovy coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
1765000	1776000	Now here's the thing about Beat and Groovy. If you look at the screenshots, it's a game you longtime Bamani fans know and love. The art style is just like that of pop and music.
1777000	1781000	That's right. Pop and music looks like it is making its way to Xbox Live Arcade as beat and groovy.
1782000	1790000	But instead of having a pop music controller, because obviously you can't get one of those through Xbox Live Arcades, instead you will be hitting five different colored buttons.
1790000	1803000	They're all different colors. Purple, blue, red, green, yellow. You use left arrow, up arrow, right arrow or X, Y or B, I'm sorry, Y or A, and then B are kind of like the different buttons.
1804000	1811000	I should call my pop and music controller. Like old school Beatmania. But I don't know. Would a pop and music controller be able to convert to the Xbox and use it? I don't know.
1811000	1820000	I wouldn't think there would be a problem with that as long as you take the circuit board out of the Xbox controller and map it into the Poppin'.
1821000	1827000	Well I will bet there will be lots of third party support too. By the way, some of the songs already announced, some of the songs are supposed to be in this.
1828000	1838000	Ryu with Starmind, the Poppin' Mix, DJ Taka with Moon, La La More, We Two Are One, Good Cool with Gotta Get My Groove On, and I know a lot of our listeners may have no idea who these people are.
1838000	1845000	But there are lots of Bamani bands. If you've been listening to the DDR music for years and years, you know a lot of these folks. Of course you would know these guys.
1846000	1851000	Orange Lounge with the 100 Second Kitchen Battle also supposed to be in this. Loki, what do you think as a long time music fan?
1852000	1862000	Sounds evil. I think he's retarded. No seriously, because they had an opportunity to bring over a game that some of the fans were looking for and what are they trying to do?
1862000	1873000	The problem with Konami, they're trying to bring on new people into their music games, I guess. They're trying to appeal to different people.
1874000	1883000	Problem is, these types of games are bought by a certain group of people, and if you try to appeal to other people, they're not going to buy it.
1883000	1893000	And I heard a rumor that pretty much those songs that you see on there, those seven songs, I think there was two more, that's it.
1894000	1896000	Well I'm sure there will be download things.
1897000	1898000	What if this is a testing round?
1898000	1915000	It's stupid though, because at least with the music it's fine, because the music's good. The art style is kind of a slap in people's face, because it's not really pop music, it's just kind of like ghetto characters, I don't know.
1916000	1923000	And at the same time, I don't know, this is in Rock Revolution, they don't know what they're doing.
1923000	1928000	Comments from chat, Gsquared68 says, if it has Vic Viper as a character, maybe I might get a 360.
1929000	1936000	Our faithless webmaster, our ever faithful webmaster says, I can't believe they kept pop music songs in the song list.
1937000	1943000	I am kind of surprised that it's at least a bit of an authentic song list, all things considered, if this game is being targeted for the US as well.
1944000	1945000	Very interesting, but of course very cheap for them too.
1945000	1955000	And Katamari's Forever says pop music should have more pop, like Avril Lavigne and Leona Lewis, and I've been saying that for a long time, that that's one way they could try and grow their audience here.
1956000	1959000	But they won't on Xbox Live Arcade.
1960000	1966000	Exactly, but this is what they need to do in order to appeal to the original fans and to expand it.
1966000	1981000	You take the game as it was, you add a lot of the songs that were originally in the game, or songs that should be in a pop music release, release it here, and you also add songs that people that may not be used to pop music would like.
1982000	1988000	Like licensed songs or just songs that are really cool that kind of appeal, that aren't necessarily pop music types of music.
1989000	1993000	Same should have been done with Rock Revolution.
1993000	1997000	They should have put some of the Bamani songs in there.
1998000	2011000	And yes, I understand that Bamani songs may not translate well for your average Guitar Hero fan, but at the same time, the fans will appreciate it and they will buy the game because of that.
2012000	2019000	And you can still have all those covers of licensed songs out there, so you can appeal to both people.
2019000	2025000	Putting these songs that you have in your library anyway, it's not going to hurt nothing. It's going to add to the game.
2026000	2030000	Let me try reading a couple more comments from chat here. Gerardimo has a very long comment here, but it's pretty good.
2031000	2037000	My problem right now is that people were bitching that Konami needed to Americanize their music games, but their hardcore fans got pissy because they wanted to keep in Konami songs.
2038000	2044000	So Konami is trying to appeal to American audience by making it less cute to appeal to Americans, but still rewarding their hardcore fans.
2044000	2048000	Now yes, they took out the controller, but perhaps they're just trying to test it.
2049000	2053000	And then SSJ100Matt says, put ABBA in there. Yeah, that'll work. ABBA will make it all better.
2054000	2055000	Absolutely.
2056000	2062000	You know, again, I'm going to withhold judgment until I actually play the game. I do think it might be a little bit of a water-testing thing, but I don't know.
2063000	2068000	Let's just say I'm not getting my expectations very high, but I'd love to have Konami folks come on the show and talk about the game.
2069000	2071000	Could be very interesting. So, we shall see.
2071000	2078000	Well, if you're looking for a seven-button controller, you remember that they are releasing a drum pad that has seven inputs on it.
2079000	2080000	Well, too bad this game only uses five.
2081000	2087000	Well, actually, it uses seven because you can use the two trigger buttons for the seven, whatever.
2088000	2089000	We'll see when it comes out.
2090000	2092000	Anyway, shall I continue?
2093000	2099000	There is another peripheral that's going to be coming out for Guitar Hero 4, but Neversoft isn't saying what it is.
2099000	2110000	The speculation, though, is that it's either going to be some type of keyboard or a turntable, because this is stated to work more specifically with the studio mode.
2111000	2116000	I kind of think of a mixing board. I wouldn't be surprised to see a mixing board.
2117000	2122000	Interesting. A lot of people speculate a keyboard, because that's like the obvious thing, but that would be interesting, a mixing board, like Kraken DJ.
2123000	2126000	Dude, wouldn't that be cool? They do that, and then they actually release Kraken DJ. That'd be sweet.
2126000	2130000	I don't know about that. Wasn't Kraken DJ a Sega thing?
2131000	2132000	It was indeed.
2133000	2141000	Or perhaps they could, I don't know, stop releasing peripherals. Seriously, four peripherals for this fucking game.
2142000	2147000	Granted, it will probably be great, but seriously, it's a little overkill.
2148000	2154000	I know people are really enthusiastic about making their songs and stuff like that, but...
2154000	2159000	But they're totally in a penis envy war with Rock Band and all those folks right now.
2160000	2166000	Whatever. They could try to get a jump on it, I guess. Release all the peripherals you want. I just won't buy them.
2167000	2168000	So, whatever.
2169000	2178000	Anyways, there's going to be some pretty cool stuff coming out for, well, another DS release of Guitar Hero.
2178000	2186000	It's Guitar Hero On Tour Decades, and of course we'll have music from the 80s and all sorts of other genres.
2187000	2197000	They've got Modern Music, which includes Dirty Little Secret by the All-American Rejects, Crush Crush Crush by Paramore,
2198000	2205000	The Takeover, The Break's Over from Fall Out Boy, and The Pretender from Foo Fighters and Smashing Pumpkins with Tarantula.
2205000	2217000	And then they also have the 2000s with Linkin Park One Step Closer, Can't Stop by Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Middle with Jimmy Eat World,
2218000	2221000	and I Can't Believe in Things Called Love by The Darkness and many more.
2222000	2225000	So they're going to basically have different decades to go along with all this.
2226000	2230000	Pretty much the game is going to be exactly like Guitar Hero On Tour.
2230000	2238000	They've just kind of tweaked a few things, including where they'd have you sign autographs and sign different things,
2239000	2242000	signing wristbands and stuff like that.
2243000	2245000	I don't know, it's more of the same, just different track list.
2246000	2247000	Much like all the music games.
2248000	2250000	Much like all the other Guitar Hero games have been lately.
2251000	2255000	That's why they need to add new peripherals, because they're starting to feel like the same damn game over and over again.
2256000	2257000	Yeah, that's what it is. I don't know.
2257000	2262000	You know, this isn't our show world, but I heard rumors also that, or I should say I read rumors,
2263000	2268000	that they were talking about doing yet another peripheral for a Tony Hawk game on the DS.
2269000	2272000	Seriously, stop making on the DS?
2273000	2274000	Like a fingerboard?
2275000	2281000	Possibly a fingerboard, or possibly, they were suggesting that maybe it's like,
2281000	2288000	there was that mag game that they had where you basically would slide the DS around, kind of like a motion sensor almost.
2289000	2290000	Interesting.
2291000	2295000	I don't know, it's still retarded though. Stop releasing games with peripherals.
2296000	2297000	Do you guys remember those fingerboards from back in the day?
2298000	2300000	Like when I was in high school, they actually had those little things on keychains,
2301000	2303000	and you actually used your fingers to move this little thing around.
2304000	2305000	You did little tricks, like they had little miniature ramps.
2306000	2307000	I remember you having one of those.
2308000	2309000	Years and years ago, yeah.
2309000	2311000	When we were first hanging out.
2312000	2313000	Yeah, because I thought they were funny.
2314000	2318000	That dates back to like the early 90s when those things started, I don't know.
2319000	2322000	Anyhow, sorry, it just made me think of that whole talk about a Tony Hawk peripheral.
2323000	2327000	Anyhow, going back to music games for a minute, and of course going way back to a series that has been going on for a long, long time,
2328000	2331000	it is still going. Dance Dance Revolution has some new games coming out,
2332000	2336000	and the DDR community over at DDROnlineCommunity.com, the official Dance Dance Revolution community,
2336000	2342000	has released some teasers for the upcoming songs for their new games, such as Dance Dance Revolution X.
2343000	2345000	That's the new game that's coming out on the Playstation 2 a little later this year,
2346000	2348000	and they have announced some of the songs in the game.
2349000	2354000	Big Girls Don't Cry, it's just a cover, so it's a more dancey version of the old Fergie classic.
2355000	2359000	You Can't Touch This by MC Hammer, that would be the original, is going to be in there.
2359000	2366000	But of note, brand new remixes, 2008 X edits of Butterfly and Dubby Dub.
2367000	2369000	Remember Dubby Dub, or you would probably know this as...
2370000	2376000	So they're basically just re-cutting the song, it doesn't look like a remix, they're just taking a different portion.
2377000	2382000	Well it says, enjoy the familiar, impossible to resist melody while exploring the fresh new arrangement.
2383000	2385000	It's been reworked exclusively for DDRX.
2385000	2391000	That's coming with some new Konami originals as well, lots of new Konami originals.
2392000	2396000	If you want to see the entire list of the 33 songs, you can check that out at ddronlinecommunity.com.
2397000	2401000	They've also released some of the songs that are going to be in DDR Hottest Party 2, that's the Wii version of DDR.
2402000	2405000	Remember the Wii version of DDR does things a little differently, they do all covers.
2406000	2411000	And so like there's Umbrella, you knew that had to be in there, the Rihanna classic, during the cover of that.
2411000	2416000	Black and White by Michael Jackson, Tootsie Roll, that song's awesome.
2417000	2424000	I Want Candy, Bust a Move, Obsession, I thought that was kind of interesting, the old synth pop song you still hear at goth clubs till today.
2425000	2431000	Call on Me, but this one I thought was most interesting, Nelly Furtado's All Good Things Come to an End.
2432000	2436000	They've remade that as a dance classic, but then again if they can do that to Lips of an Angel, why not do it to that song too.
2436000	2440000	That's DDR Hottest Party 2 coming to the Nintendo Wii a little later this year.
2441000	2449000	There was one of those tracks on DDRX, I'm not going to say what it was, number 4, that song was awesome.
2450000	2452000	It's an awesome remix of another song from DDR.
2453000	2462000	Also I was going to mention though, this is a cool title for a song, the 30 lives up up down dance mix, that's awesome.
2462000	2465000	That is a pretty good name for a dinner song.
2466000	2471000	DDROnlineCommunity.com if you want to see a list of songs coming to your DDR games later this year.
2472000	2479000	And I'm sure it's just a matter of time before we start talking about Universe 3, and who knows what else in the DDR franchise on into 2009.
2480000	2489000	Well how about something that is a little on the different end going into the Sega world, because this is super super happy.
2489000	2497000	Well, Samba de Amigo is going to be actually coming out on the Wii. Did we know this?
2498000	2499000	We did know this.
2500000	2503000	But the other good thing about it is that they are actually talking about download content.
2504000	2512000	So with that, the Wii exclusive track list, if you are ready for this.
2513000	2514000	Sure.
2514000	2519000	We have Baila Mae via Gypsy Kings and I Love Gypsy Kings. They do a really good cover of Hotel California.
2520000	2523000	Papa loves Mambo, Mambo number 8, sorry.
2524000	2526000	Conga, Miami Sound Machine.
2527000	2529000	Lowrider, Mambo number 5.
2530000	2534000	Okay, I really have very little idea how to pronounce just about anything in Spanish.
2535000	2537000	Oye Como Va by Santana.
2538000	2539000	Just a bunch of stuff.
2539000	2544000	So there is actually a Jennifer Lopez song on here too, which I am like meh about.
2545000	2563000	There are some previously returning tracks like Tubthumping, The Cup of Life, Samba De Janeiro, Bombalayo, Take On Me the Real Big Fish version, Tequila, Soul Bossa Nova.
2563000	2569000	Downloadable tracks are with Mambo Mambo and I Want Candy and Are You Going to Be My Girl.
2570000	2575000	That's cool that some of the songs from the old school Samba De Amigo or Coming Back like the Real Big Fish Take On Me.
2576000	2579000	I seem to remember that was in the Dreamcast. That was the download song on the Dreamcast.
2580000	2584000	Although they weren't really downloads. They were pay to unlock. Well no, they weren't pay. You didn't have to pay back then.
2585000	2586000	They were download.
2586000	2594000	They were download to unlock. Which though that does give me this bad feeling especially because we're talking about the Wii here. Is this going to be pay to unlock content?
2595000	2597000	It's supposedly not pay to unlock content.
2598000	2599000	Oh that would be good.
2600000	2606000	Now this is what's cool. The maracas controller are going to be that bright hot red.
2606000	2619000	One of them has a nunchuck attachment inside and the other one is for your wiimote attachment. I'll be putting a picture of this up on the chatroom.
2620000	2621000	chat.ownerslaunchedrader.com
2622000	2626000	And everybody say a big thank you to Sega for giving us the maracas controller so this game feels right.
2627000	2628000	Thank you Sega.
2629000	2630000	It wasn't Sega. I don't think they're licensed.
2630000	2635000	They're not licensed by Nintendo or something.
2636000	2641000	Well still, somebody got it out there one way or another. I hope they make the little shakey shake noise.
2642000	2643000	I think they do.
2644000	2647000	Awesome. And this game better still make you pose.
2648000	2652000	Posing is the best part. But you know what? We still need the tambourine game too.
2652000	2660000	I know. This needs to sell a million zillion copies so that we can get the tambourine game next. Because we never even got that on the Dreamcast.
2661000	2666000	But you know I'm all about the tambourine. There's that giant A button. You can press that to do a little slapping thing.
2667000	2668000	We've got to get the tambourine game here in the US.
2669000	2676000	In fact, if we have a chance to talk to Sega at Penny Arcade Expo next week, that's the one question I want to ask. Where's the tambourine game?
2677000	2678000	I talked to Sega.
2678000	2681000	I'll talk to Sega. We want the tambourine game.
2682000	2683000	Well let's all bug them.
2684000	2691000	I got to say because we had our games conference at work not last week but the week before last.
2692000	2701000	And I got to say Sega's lineup was probably one of the coolest lineups I've seen. They actually kind of get it. Which is surprising.
2702000	2705000	Is that because there's been a couple years where they have not been getting it?
2705000	2712000	I guess. Well it's not just Sonic stuff. They're putting out stuff. Like they're taking risks I guess.
2713000	2718000	With like Mad World, the House of Dead game that's coming out and stuff like that.
2719000	2725000	Everybody's got to be picky in chat. SSG100Matt says, I will not say thank you to Sega until Shenmue 3 comes out.
2728000	2729000	Hold your breath?
2730000	2733000	I want it to come out too, but don't hold your breath.
2733000	2738000	Act Deaf calls what happened this week at your work the Loki Zig games convention.
2739000	2743000	Yeah it wasn't very exciting. I got to see people act like idiots so that was fun.
2744000	2748000	Alright how about some release dates Loki? Let's travel the world and look at release dates from around the world.
2749000	2752000	Alright this week we've got quite a bit of stuff coming out actually. Some good stuff.
2753000	2759000	Starting off we've got Commando Steel Disaster on the DS. Now this game might not sound familiar to you guys.
2759000	2765000	But it plays exactly like Metal Slug. And it looks kind of like Metal Slug.
2766000	2774000	So definitely check it out if you're into the fast shooter games like Contra, Metal Slug. Worth checking out.
2775000	2782000	So that's on the DS. Also on the DS MLB Power Pros 2008, Konami's super deformed baseball game.
2782000	2789000	Nintendo, not to be outdone by Konami, is putting out Mario Super Sluggers on the Wii.
2790000	2792000	Funnel family baseball game.
2793000	2802000	On pretty much all systems, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09. That's coming out on Playstation 2, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and the PSP.
2803000	2808000	On the PS3 we have Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice.
2808000	2816000	Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli on Playstation 2, PS3, Wii, and the DS.
2817000	2829000	Vampire Rain Altered Species on Playstation 3. In case you forgot, this game really sucked on the Xbox 360 just so you know.
2829000	2841000	Picto Image on the DS, Kid Sports Crazy Golf by Destineer, which is a company only known for great games.
2842000	2845000	Oh wait, that's right. All their games are shovelware. Much like this game.
2846000	2855000	GTR Evolution on the PC, Pajama Sam Don't Fear the Dark on the Wii, and Freddy Fish in the Kelp Seed Mystery on the Wii.
2855000	2860000	And Spy Fox in Dry... That sounds like fun, Freddy Fish in the Kelp Mystery.
2861000	2867000	And Spy Fox in Dry Cereal on the Wii, all of which are meant for little kids.
2868000	2871000	Wait, what? Spy Fox in Dry Cereal.
2872000	2876000	Nice. You know, like the episode's called Dry Cereal.
2877000	2878000	Alright, some guy kidnapped the milk.
2879000	2880000	Let's travel the world.
2881000	2882000	Whoa whoa whoa, I'm not done yet!
2882000	2886000	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Damn, there's a lot coming out this week after weeks of nothing.
2887000	2908000	Yes, Tales of Vesperia on Xbox 360, N Plus on PSP and DS, From the Abyss on DS, Harvest Moon Island of Happiness on the DS, Digimon World Championship on the DS, Sims 2 Apartment Pets on the DS, Falling Stars on the Playstation 2,
2908000	2922000	Um, Penumbra Requiem on PC, Prison Tycoon 4 Super Max on PC, The Sims Apartment Life on DS and PC.
2923000	2925000	I think that's only on the PC because the DS is something different.
2926000	2931000	And let's see, Garfield Fun Fest on the DS, Sid Meier's Pirates on the Mac.
2932000	2933000	Sounds like fun.
2933000	2937000	Ford Racing Offroad on the Wii, Hacker Evolution Reinsertion on PC.
2938000	2939000	That's the worst subtitle ever.
2940000	2943000	And Project Powder on PC, and that's not a good follow.
2944000	2947000	Project Powder? Is that based on the movie from like ten years ago?
2948000	2948000	I can only hope.
2948000	2963000	James Pond, Codename Robocod, my god these are all horrible names on the DS, Mind Habits on the Mac, Flat Out Ultimate Carnage on PC, and Operation Mania on PC.
2964000	2966000	Do you think Tales of Vesperia will be as big here as it was over in Japan?
2967000	2969000	Because I don't know if you've heard, but it's been selling like crazy over in Japan.
2970000	2971000	It's been pushing 360 units out the door.
2972000	2972000	I know, that's crazy.
2973000	2974000	That's one of the big stories we missed by not being here last week.
2974000	2979000	No, I don't think it's going to do us well because Infinino Discovery is coming out next week.
2980000	2980000	Oh snap.
2981000	2982000	Alright, well speaking of Japan.
2983000	2984000	And Mercenaries 2, where the hell is Mercenaries 2?
2985000	2986000	Jesus Christ, are we done with the USA?
2987000	2992000	No, Mercenaries 2, it's coming out on PC, PlayStation 2, PS3, and Xbox 360.
2993000	2996000	Next time just go, a bunch of shit, a bunch of shit is coming out in the US.
2997000	2998000	Hey, I have to inform them what's coming out.
2999000	2999000	Alright.
3000000	3001000	Are you done? Are we finally done?
3001000	3003000	Amanda, Steel Disaster picked it up on DS.
3004000	3005000	That's all, I'm done.
3006000	3009000	Are you sure? Are you sure? Alright, I'm finished.
3010000	3012000	Moving over to Japan, if I can.
3013000	3015000	We've been talking about the release dates over there on the Xbox 360.
3016000	3018000	2 Human finally makes its way to Japan on August 28th.
3019000	3022000	Also coming out, Clannad is coming out in Japan on the Xbox 360.
3023000	3025000	This is not to be confused with the Irish music group.
3026000	3028000	I think Enya's sister is in Clannad.
3029000	3029000	Yes.
3029000	3030000	Because Enya was once in the band.
3031000	3033000	Clannad is also a Japanese manga.
3034000	3036000	So this is coming out on 360, they're making a game of it.
3037000	3038000	So that sounds exciting.
3039000	3041000	Although I don't know, an Enya game might be kind of exciting too.
3042000	3045000	On the PlayStation 3, guess what Japan is getting this week?
3046000	3051000	Africa comes out finally on the PlayStation 3 this week.
3052000	3054000	Oh, Loki has that look on his face of maybe I should import that.
3054000	3061000	Alright, Battlefield Bad Company and Disgaea 3, but the English language version comes out.
3062000	3066000	It's all Asia regions. Sometimes some Asian dates sneak on my list too.
3067000	3068000	So Disgaea 3 is something to look forward to.
3069000	3071000	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii over in Japan.
3072000	3074000	You ready for it? Captain Rainbow on August 28th.
3075000	3076000	Oh yeah.
3077000	3080000	You need to import that shit, Loki. Get that game instead.
3080000	3083000	Alright, on the PlayStation 2, lots of games coming out.
3084000	3086000	Another Mahjong game, Mahjong Sangokushi coming out.
3087000	3095000	As well as Yotsuno, a Journey of Sincerity comes out from Gadgetsoft on the 28th.
3096000	3103000	Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Nariai Ring Cross Bongol Returns comes out on the PlayStation 2 as well.
3104000	3105000	Yes, it's a baseball game.
3106000	3108000	Moving on to the handheld, seeing what's coming out over there.
3108000	3113000	We've got on the Nintendo DS, Johnny no Dasutsu Daisukusen.
3114000	3123000	And just because it would not be a week in Japanese release dates without something coming to us from Broccoli known as Neon Genesis Evangelion.
3124000	3125000	More Eva!
3126000	3133000	This time, Ayanami Ikusei Kyaku DS with Asuka, Hokkan Kyaku.
3134000	3136000	Okay, what about Rei and Asuka?
3136000	3139000	I don't know, I'm looking at the more details on this game.
3140000	3142000	Rei is the character I hate, Ayanami.
3143000	3145000	And Asuka's the awesome one that speaks German.
3146000	3148000	There you have it, another DS game coming out there.
3149000	3155000	Tactical Guild also coming out and To Love, Rue Trouble comes out from Marvelous as well.
3156000	3160000	Quickly taking a look at the PSP to see if there's anything of note to mention to you guys.
3161000	3164000	Fate Tiger Coliseum Upper is the only game coming out.
3164000	3165000	There you go.
3166000	3168000	That's your week in Japanese release dates.
3169000	3173000	Well how about our European release dates?
3174000	3176000	We've got a bunch, they're all the 29th.
3177000	3180000	GTR Evolution, that's on PC.
3181000	3185000	We have Driving Theory Training, I guess so you learn how to drive in theory from Atari.
3185000	3208000	Ferrari Challenge on Wii, Legend of Sayuki, Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution on DS, Smash Court Tennis 3, Soul Calibur Legends on Wii, Super Swing Golf, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 on a bunch of systems, and Two Human on Xbox 360.
3209000	3212000	Sweet. Busy week around the world. Crazy stuff.
3212000	3224000	Alright, and we've got some quick mentions with more release dates, not stuff coming out soon, but soon enough I guess, among other things.
3225000	3233000	Fallout 3 was announced this week that it will be coming out on October 28th on PlayStation 3 and on the Xbox 360 as well as the Special Edition.
3234000	3238000	And that should be as big as Oblivion, if not bigger.
3238000	3244000	This week on Hot Shots Golf, there was Kratos download content.
3245000	3256000	You can actually play as the God of War using, I'm trying to remember what the blades were, the Clubs of Chaos in the golf game. I guess that's cute.
3257000	3258000	Silent Hill Homecoming.
3259000	3260000	How much are they going to whore that guy out, seriously?
3261000	3262000	Forever.
3262000	3272000	Silent Hill Homecoming was kind of in question whether it's going to be still coming out in September, since the European version was delayed a bit.
3273000	3278000	It is still set for September in North America, and the PC version will be coming out as well.
3279000	3289000	It will only be available on Steam, however, and if I remember correctly, Silent Hill Homecoming is just barely in September. I think it's on the 30th if I remember correctly.
3289000	3296000	And then Nintendo, there's some Nintendo stuff announced, or maybe not announced.
3297000	3306000	Wii Music, slated for October 27th. I can't imagine that's a really good date to release that, but more power to them, I guess.
3306000	3324000	Pokemon Ranger Shadows of Almia on the 10th of November, and Animal Crossing City Folk on the 16th of November, along with the Wii Speak speaker, conference room, mic, whatever you want to call it.
3324000	3340000	Although, what you may not know, despite what they announced at E3, it will not be coming with the Wii Speak microphone. You will have to buy that separately, and the microphone will cost you $29.99.
3341000	3344000	Is that a secret? I have not heard that. This is like the first time I'm hearing this.
3345000	3347000	Well, that's because no one knows about it yet.
3348000	3351000	Interesting, alright. Well, that's too bad.
3351000	3357000	You know, from a retail standpoint, that's good because then there won't be shortages on the game, but...
3358000	3359000	I guess that's true.
3360000	3363000	Alright, well, thanks for the updates, Loki.
3364000	3369000	AlphaCananagram says it was already known, I think, so who knows.
3370000	3377000	Well, here's one game that people are definitely anticipating, Final Fantasy XIII, and the question is, when is the demo coming?
3377000	3381000	And you might have heard that there is a demo coming, I think we talked about it a couple of weeks ago.
3382000	3386000	It's coming with the Final Fantasy Advent Children Blu-Ray release, the complete version, which has the extra footage.
3387000	3403000	Well, here's the interesting thing, it's being reported by IGN that apparently in Famitsu PS3 edition, apparently the director of Final Fantasy XIII, Motomu Toriyama, has said that it's going to be a two-hour demo.
3403000	3415000	So, that's a heck of a lot of demo. He says, quote, like the Final Fantasy VII demo that was included with PlayStation's Tow Ball number one, it will be similar to that, it will allow folks to experience the opening sequence and prologue.
3416000	3427000	So that could be pretty interesting. They're trying to accomplish with this demo, get people acquainted with the party system, seeing the game through multiple characters, points of view, and you will actually be controlling more than one character in the demo.
3427000	3438000	Apparently, in Final Fantasy XIII, there is no central character. You will be controlling one character after another in classic Final Fantasy form. So that could be interesting.
3439000	3455000	So I'm very curious to see what this demo looks like. I'm not surprised they're saying it's two hours, but I still think there's people that are going to blast right through it, but it's probably one of those things where there might be a lot of hidden depth to it, and you can milk two hours out of it, but I imagine most people will burn through it in an hour.
3455000	3459000	But we'll see. I know I will definitely be getting this demo.
3460000	3461000	I will be importing this bitch.
3462000	3470000	You should import that bitch. I want to see this demo, although there will be YouTubes all over, I still don't see it on a high def TV, and you just can't get that on YouTube.
3471000	3474000	Well, we at least would know people that would do it anyway.
3474000	3486000	Sure, true. Well, for people who are fans of Street Fighter IV, that is actually, I do believe, just recently had a console version announced.
3487000	3498000	There is going to be Kami in the game, so she will be included in the console release of Street Fighter IV, and that makes people happy because they like to see her butt crack.
3499000	3500000	Who doesn't?
3501000	3502000	No answer.
3502000	3503000	No answer.
3504000	3505000	Alright.
3506000	3514000	So, totally unrelated to Kami and butt crack, well actually this is kind of funny.
3515000	3525000	The PlayStation 3 will be getting a wireless keypad with mouse input, and I guess the way it kind of relates to butt crack is it sort of looks like a COD piece.
3525000	3535000	But, I don't understand where the mouse input is coming from because I don't see any sort of touchpad or anything, unless they're having you rub your fingers over the letters, I don't know.
3536000	3553000	But, yeah, it's kind of interesting, kind of cool, and it snaps to the joystick much like, I don't know, the chatpad, but this time instead of being below the actual controller, it's above it.
3553000	3555000	So, that's kind of neat.
3556000	3567000	And other things that it will feature, quick keys for your friends lists and for your messages, as well as the ability to type and all that fun stuff.
3568000	3577000	Very interesting that the PS3 has been compared a lot of times to a computer, and even have a lot of games that have these PC boards, and now they're giving mouse inputs on there.
3578000	3579000	I think it's awesome, I mean it has a web browser.
3580000	3581000	It's not a bad thing.
3581000	3584000	It has a web browser, I mean, that would be useful.
3585000	3591000	You know what would also be useful to have a keyboard? The PSP! Seriously folks, where the fuck is the PSP keyboard?
3592000	3596000	ActDeft in chat says, Sony, we don't innovate, we imitate.
3597000	3601000	I always thought that was kind of Microsoft's thing, is that, you know, anything you can do, I can do better, remember that?
3602000	3603000	But that's innovating.
3604000	3605000	I guess that's true, when you make it better.
3605000	3611000	Yeah, Sony has been playing a lot of catch up though, you know, but I don't know, this mouse thing is kind of neat, I guess.
3612000	3616000	Now this is good though, what better on the PlayStation 3 than something free?
3617000	3620000	And we like free things, the only bad news for us is that it's happening in Europe.
3621000	3623000	Oh well, we still have some friends overseas that listen to our show.
3624000	3625000	Guess what, you guys are getting something called vidzone.
3626000	3629000	It's something for the PS3 that involves music videos.
3630000	3633000	It's a streaming music video service that's going to be launching on the PlayStation 3.
3633000	3636000	The trial of this whole thing is supposed to be starting in early 2009.
3637000	3639000	It's going to be taking place in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
3640000	3646000	What the vidzone will include, a full playlist of videos from hip hop to punk, heavy metal, and classics.
3647000	3655000	And you'll actually be able to build your own playlist, you can download songs and music videos and ringtones, but some of that might actually end up costing you.
3655000	3665000	So while I guess it'll probably be free to maybe watch some of the videos on demand and stuff, if you actually want to take away the ringtones or download the songs, that's going to cost you a little bit of money.
3666000	3670000	By the way though, now this is kind of cool, it will do the whole remote play thing.
3671000	3673000	So if you download a music video, you can put it on your PSP.
3674000	3678000	So if there's a music video that you just have to have with you on the go, you can do that.
3678000	3685000	And that's one of Sony's strengths right now, is that they've built a really good relationship between the PS3 and the PSP for those that own both.
3686000	3688000	So that does sound kind of cool, I've got to admit.
3689000	3694000	I mean how neat would it be to say, oh there's this great new song, oh wait you haven't heard it? Oh here, I got it on my PSP.
3695000	3698000	Kind of neat. So props to them for that, really.
3699000	3701000	I can do that, I have an iPhone.
3702000	3703000	Touché.
3703000	3710000	Well, in other, this has just been exactly like you said, a music loaded, you know.
3711000	3719000	It really has, it's a music filled show tonight, and it's not just because we love music games based on our history, but it really has been dominating the news this week.
3720000	3725000	But consider how much music games are selling these days, between Guitar Hero, Rock Band and all that, it's big business now.
3726000	3728000	Whereas we were nerds back in the day for playing them.
3728000	3743000	Well, still. There actually was an announcement at Leipzig that was said that there is going to be a SingStar songs that, let me start over.
3744000	3755000	There are, it says over 2.2 million SingStar songs were downloaded from the SingStore that launched about a year ago.
3755000	3762000	So now there's actually new plans for a Disney version for PS2 that's all Disney songs.
3763000	3769000	And you know, there was a rumor about this a while back, and I called bullshit on it, because I thought Disney would do it themselves.
3770000	3771000	They are doing it themselves.
3772000	3773000	Well there's more.
3774000	3775000	Okay, go ahead, sorry.
3776000	3778000	It's exclusively for PAL territories.
3778000	3785000	Exactly, because in the North American territories, and possibly Japan, I don't know.
3786000	3796000	But it's compatible with the SingStar PS3, and of course if you have an HDTV it won't matter if it's PAL or not.
3797000	3799000	Loki, it's not just because SingStar performs better in Europe?
3799000	3808000	Yeah, it does perform better in Europe, but in the US, or North America I should say, they are releasing Disney's Sing It.
3809000	3816000	Which is basically like SingStar, but it's all the Disney songs, and you know, they're kind of a version of a karaoke game.
3817000	3821000	Now something that did make our show roll tonight, but apparently there's a SingStar queen on the way too.
3822000	3823000	Like the band, Queen?
3824000	3825000	I would be so all over that.
3826000	3826000	Yeah, exactly.
3826000	3830000	I actually like SingStar better than Karaoke Revolution.
3831000	3835000	They both have their strengths and weaknesses to me.
3836000	3842000	I think Karaoke Revolution is a better game as a package, but I think SingStar has the better music overall.
3843000	3848000	Lips though, I have really high hopes for Lips. I think it's going to take what's great from both games, honestly.
3848000	3861000	Well what's kind of cool also, I was going to say, there's another announcement that they're going to do a patch for SingStar PS3 where you can use your PlayStation 2 disc to import songs from that as well.
3862000	3863000	Like you can with the PlayStation 2 version.
3864000	3866000	Good! I think that's a great idea. Good for them.
3866000	3879000	Something else that's kind of neat, and no, I was reading in the chat room, well actually that was for Africa, but no more games are going to get added on to the bet.
3880000	3881000	So you can forget about it.
3882000	3886000	And this is another game that will not be added on to the bet, but it also uses the PlayStation Eye.
3887000	3888000	It's Eye Pet.
3889000	3894000	It's basically a game where you prod what looks to be a little monkey creature.
3894000	3897000	And to be honest, it is very cute looking.
3898000	3907000	And if I didn't have a TV that was, you know, kind of with a plastic screen, you know, an LCD TV, I would let my cat play with this.
3908000	3912000	But yeah, so it's a virtual pet.
3913000	3914000	And you get the Poked.
3915000	3916000	And it's coming out in 2009.
3917000	3920000	Oh goody. Just what the world needs.
3921000	3922000	More virtual pets.
3922000	3930000	They'll probably have, well this is kind of cool because you can like pick it up and stuff, or pretend to pick it up and throw it around.
3931000	3936000	Alright, well one more story for you guys before we get to the end of part A in the Classic Game of the Week.
3937000	3938000	And it's more music games.
3939000	3942000	I mean we just had a lot to talk about tonight, and the question is, what's Harmonix going to do next?
3943000	3945000	I mean, you know, they've obviously had mega success with Rock Band.
3945000	3954000	The rumor is that apparently Harmonix is dealing in the new game that has to do with music creation.
3955000	3960000	It's something that their PR rep John Drake said, talking to MTV's multiplayer blog.
3961000	3962000	We've done the whole MIDI creation thing.
3963000	3969000	We think we can do something really ambitious and really great that's going to speak across all the users of the game, not just hardcore users.
3970000	3972000	And that will result in some awesome stuff and not just Final Fantasy covers.
3972000	3977000	So, interesting that Harmonix might get into a little more of the creation.
3978000	3980000	You know, Harmonix has put out a lot of solid products.
3981000	3983000	I assume if they're going to go this way, it's going to be some pretty good stuff.
3984000	3990000	I look forward to their next project, and I hope it's just not, you know, Rock Band 3, Rock Band 4, Rock Band 5, you know what I mean?
3991000	3995000	I'm looking forward to new, original things they come out with. Wouldn't you agree?
3995000	4002000	Yes. You know, um, that's right. What, Loki? I was going to say, kind of going back to the last story that we had.
4003000	4008000	I was checking out the trailer for that iPad. It actually looks really cute, actually.
4009000	4010000	I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by it.
4011000	4014000	I'm surprised to hear you describing a game as cute. What makes it so cute?
4015000	4020000	Well, the creature is incredibly fuzzy and cute. It kind of looks like a little miniature monkey Simba.
4020000	4028000	Anyways, what's kind of neat, though, is some of the technology that they're using with it, you can draw your pet toys.
4029000	4032000	So, basically, you draw a little car, and it becomes a car.
4033000	4036000	It's kind of like some of those tech demos they were showing off using the PlayStation Eye.
4037000	4045000	That's the kind of thing with the PlayStation Eye. They're actually doing some really cool things with it, unlike the Eye toy, which is just a lot of crap.
4045000	4054000	So, I'm kind of excited to see what they're going to do with this, and I may actually have to pick up this game, just because my cat would love playing with this thing.
4056000	4057000	That's why.
4058000	4060000	Alright. Sounds good.
4061000	4068000	Alright, well, we've got one more bit for you guys here before we go to a break, and that is the Classic Game of the Week.
4068000	4077000	That's right. Every week, Dark Sakura goes to the archives and finds a game suitable for all of you out there in Orange Lawn's radio podcast land to check out and play.
4078000	4084000	And she's got a good one for you tonight. It's going to be one of those games where you're like, oh, she hasn't done this game yet. Amazing.
4085000	4088000	So, Dark Sakura, what should the kids be playing this week?
4089000	4096000	The game of the week is Jet Set Radio, which is one of my all-time favorite games.
4096000	4098000	Let's have some music, shall we, Rob?
4099000	4100000	Working on it.
4101000	4113000	Okay. Well, at any rate, Jet Set Radio is a game where you start off as this guy named Beat who is a runaway who got shoved from gang to gang until he decided to make one of his own, and they basically just go around tagging shit.
4114000	4119000	That's really the purpose of the game, is to tag stuff and wipe out your opposition.
4119000	4126000	And it's got some good music in it. We've got some Guitar Vader, which I like Guitar Vader.
4126000	4149000	In the U.S. version, there was a track by Mixmaster Mike and by, actually Dragula was in it, Rob Zombie. And there were a few that were only in the PAL release, too, such as, let's see, some of the groups was Semi Detached and Jurassic Five.
4149000	4158000	In the Japanese version, there was one by David Soul. So each release had its own stuff. Let's play some music.
4171000	4175000	This game really was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed this game when they were in gas.
4175000	4187000	Well, at any rate, the way that you go through the game is that you've got basically rollerblades, and you pick up different people in the game to bring them into your own little gang of Rudy's, they're called.
4188000	4195000	Like, the main guy, Beat, is very, you know, all around, you know, even. He's very balanced.
4195000	4206000	But you get another guy later, I don't remember his name, he was the guy who had the big boom box. He was really slow and really tough, so you could use him for, like, endurance.
4207000	4215000	But as the game goes through, you know, the police come after you and you have to knock them over, and you can actually tag the head detective who comes after you.
4216000	4221000	But in later stages, like, they send out helicopters to shoot you down and all kinds of stuff. It's crazy.
4221000	4230000	And then the last level is you're fighting this guy on top of a giant record album who's trying to use the album to summon a demon, but that won't ruin that for anybody.
4231000	4235000	But there were other releases after this first coin came out.
4235000	4261000	By the way, the Jet Set Radio thing is, actually, this Professor K is a DJ in a pirate radio station in the city of Tokyo-cho. There's also different areas in the game that represent a different time of day, like Shibuya-cho is daytime, Benten-cho is nighttime, and Kogane-cho is, like, a residential area at sunset. That's pretty cool.
4261000	4272000	But you've also got your rival gangs in there. There is the Poison Jam that wear fish costumes. They're kind of stupid.
4273000	4281000	The Noise Tanks are cyborg types, and Love Shockers are a girl game that look like the emo rangers, which I thought was funny.
4281000	4296000	And then you have to fight the Golden Rhinos later. The other versions that I was talking about is there was a Jet Set Radio Future that came out on Xbox, and we got it in America as JSRF, Jet Set Radio Future.
4297000	4304000	It came out in Europe, too. Basically, it was just a bit more touched up, you know, had different music.
4304000	4314000	Jet Set Radio came out on Game Boy Advance that was from an isometric perspective. It was alright, you know, it was cute.
4315000	4330000	Then there was actually one that was actually released called De La Jet Set Radio, which was the deluxe version, that was only in Japan via Dreamcast Direct.
4330000	4341000	It later came out of Sega Direct. So it's really hard to get a hold of, but you actually could download it in Europe.
4342000	4346000	You could actually set it for English, and the text of the game would be in English, but all the voices were in Japanese.
4347000	4352000	But it was also in German, French, and Spanish, too. So if anyone's got that, I'd like to see it.
4352000	4361000	And then a headstrong game actually talked to Sega about making Jet Set Radio Wii, and Sega's like, nuh-uh.
4362000	4371000	Bastards! That would be so great! Or especially with all the Dreamcast love we've seen on Xbox Live Arcade lately, what with Soul Calibur and some of these games.
4372000	4379000	I would love to see Jet Set Radio take a new form on Xbox Live Arcade or something, you know what I mean? Don't let this franchise rot away.
4379000	4389000	Well, the other thing that I also didn't mention is that, as much as I hate the name, we did get our first release in America as Jet Grind Radio.
4390000	4399000	So I don't know why I think maybe someone else had licensed Jet Set Radio or something. It was stupid, so now they fixed it for later versions.
4399000	4409000	Alright, well there you have it, your classic game of the week. Jet Set Radio or Jet Grind Radio, whatever you prefer.
4410000	4413000	Just go do some graffiti, but not in real life. Strictly for the games.
4414000	4416000	Oh, the other thing about that, you actually had a graffiti editor.
4417000	4418000	That's right, I remember that.
4419000	4420000	So I thought that was pretty cool.
4420000	4428000	See, that's why they need it. Imagine, with download content and everything, we could have OLR gang signs that you could use as graffiti. Alright, there you have it.
4429000	4432000	A very excellent classic game of the week. True, true classic there.
4433000	4437000	Alright, we are going to take a break, but fear not, we'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4438000	4447000	For those of you on the podcast, you'll just hear some quick not-commercials, because there are promos for other podcasts or other commercials for things going on out in the world that is completely free.
4447000	4451000	So we call it a free break. We're going to take a free break and we'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4452000	4456000	For those of you guys listening live to us, though, on AllGames.com as we do tape live on Sunday nights, you'll hear some music.
4457000	4462000	Just a quick couple of songs and then some free break and we'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio Part B.
4463000	4473000	Lots of stuff to come. Rumors abound about the 360 and this apparent price drop that's coming and if Microsoft's going to be taking some cues from Nintendo and what have you.
4473000	4479000	And then, by the way, something a lot of our listeners call in to talk about, canned, not happening this year.
4480000	4484000	We're going to talk about all that in Part B when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4491000	4497000	So you've got a bunch of websites and podcasts about anime, manga, or video games, but you just don't have the time to read and listen to them all.
4497000	4502000	When are you actually going to find the time to play games or watch anime?

4551000	4558000	Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts from OLR here. You know, I hate it when people come up to me and tell me I just lost the game.
4559000	4566000	I can't help but think to myself, what game? I'm not playing any video games right this second. Or I don't remember signing up to play Monopoly.
4566000	4570000	Apparently it's some stupid internet joke where if I think about the game, I lose the game.
4571000	4576000	You know, next time some kid tells me I just lost the game, I'm gonna tell them that they just lost their balance.
4577000	4584000	Then when they look at me like a puppy dog and say, what? I'll kick them in the shin. Then I'll point and laugh. Because I'm not playing your fucking stupid game.
4584000	4596000	Can't make it to this year's Penny Arcade Expo? All Games Radio has you covered.
4597000	4604000	We're totally excited. I was at PAX last year when we announced that we were doing the game, and this is like twice as big. It's just unbelievably amazing.

4614000	4620000	You know, I haven't run into a ninja in the burning scene, but if they mythically did exist, I suspect they would take away five durability points.

4645000	4648000	Our trip to PAX has turned into a very interesting journey.
4649000	4655000	It could be the best trip of all time, or it has quite a few opportunities to go wrong on a lot of different levels.

4704000	4707000	Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4708000	4711000	I am so freaking excited about PAX. Can't get here any sooner.
4712000	4714000	But it's only a few days away from tonight.
4715000	4721000	Just to clarify, gang, some folks in the chat were asking, there will be no live Orange Lounge Radio on All Games next week, because it's 6 o'clock Pacific.
4722000	4729000	That's right when things are going to be wrapping up with the live PAX coverage, and Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki will be on a plane ride, so we can't do all our live next week.
4729000	4734000	But for those of you that listen on the podcast, which I hope all of you that listen live are still subscribed to our podcast feed,
4735000	4744000	we will be producing some shows that will go directly there from our hotel room, as well as participating in the Penny Arcade coverage that you heard there during the free break on AllGames.com.
4745000	4747000	And that's available if you want more information on that.
4747000	4760000	pax.allgames.com has all the information you need to know about that. And by the way, I love that ad. I love the fact that they have a guy in a radio voice going, and joining them is Super Happy Funtime Show.
4761000	4766000	Some of those other awesomely named podcasts that we're going to be attending with.
4767000	4773000	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news. Loki, what's this about the price drop? Is it happening?
4773000	4780000	Probably. Where there's smoke, there's fire, and there's Xbox 360 price drops.
4781000	4792000	Well, you remember back a few weeks ago that there was a rumor that the Xbox 360 would be dropping in price on all three SKUs, including the recently introduced 60GB Pro system.
4792000	4806000	Well, if the rumor is true, then on September 7th, the arcade will be dropping to $1.99, the Pro system, the 60GB, will be dropping to $2.99, and the Elite to $3.99.
4807000	4817000	And there's a little bit more proof that it will probably happen, because guess what? Just like all those other price drops that have ever happened, there have been some ads leaked.
4817000	4830000	And wouldn't you know it, Radio Shack is listing the Elite for $3.99, and the arcade for $1.99, and the ad says it's good starting September 7th.
4831000	4833000	Damn you Radio Shack, for ruining it all.
4834000	4840000	So, you know, sure we could go and say that this is all rumor and stuff, but come on.
4841000	4845000	I mean, I'm not going to insult your intelligence. Of course there's going to be a fucking price drop happening.
4845000	4852000	The same thing happens every time there's a price drop or new SKU introduced that's always leaked out by these stupid ads.
4853000	4859000	And, well, what can I tell you? Just going to have to wait a couple more Sundays and we'll see.
4860000	4865000	Do you think maybe next time they should take a different approach and not tell retailers until the day they're ready to do it?
4866000	4870000	They can't, because they have to set up their advertising that way and co-op and stuff.
4870000	4876000	So there's really no way to do it other than punish the people leaking the stuff out.
4877000	4879000	It's too hard though, it could be anybody.
4880000	4885000	It's probably a small list of people, but I don't know.
4886000	4889000	I think what's interesting though is you've got a few things happening.
4889000	4902000	One, they've dropped their system down now to match what the Playstation 3 is kind of doing with their Elite system that has 120GB of hard drive space.
4903000	4912000	And it's priced the same as the soon to be introduced 80GB core system from Sony's PS3 line there.
4912000	4923000	And also the arcade system, which there's some info on that too coming later, priced lower than the Wii.
4924000	4926000	I mean that's kind of interesting right there.
4927000	4933000	If there are Wii shortages during the holiday, people might go, hey, let's buy a 360, it's cheaper.
4934000	4935000	That's probably exactly what they want people to do.
4936000	4937000	Cheaper and easier to find, more games out there.
4937000	4948000	And now they've got family friendly titles, they're really going to pull out some good game plan, that's all I've got to say.
4949000	4951000	Alright, well I'm looking at comments in chat here.
4952000	4955000	Joshi16 says, I may buy an arcade just so I can put an Xbox in another room.
4956000	4962000	Let's see, Rama says, hey Sony, 360 is getting a price drop, do the same for PS3 you fuckers.
4962000	4967000	Darktosuius says, my brother keeps bugging me about when's the PS3 coming down.
4968000	4975000	And IkumaJP, our good friend from Japan, agrees with Loki, they can't advertise this stuff in advance.
4976000	4978000	But he does say, every time a leak happens, kittens get killed.
4979000	4981000	You know the old saying.
4982000	4987000	Alright, anyhow, you know, Loki mentioned where there's smoke there's fire, but could there be a freaking nuclear bomb?
4987000	4993000	I don't know about this one, but apparently the arcade skew, coming down to $199 based on what Loki said.
4994000	5001000	Here it comes again, rumors that there is a motion controller coming with that Xbox 360 arcade this holiday.
5002000	5006000	Apparently this new arcade system, again this may not necessarily be the one that comes on September 7th,
5007000	5009000	I would think if it is we would have heard about it a long time ago,
5010000	5013000	but possibly one that's coming later on by the holidays,
5013000	5017000	says that it's going to come with a 512 megabyte memory card,
5018000	5022000	and the new Xbox experience is already there on the system so you don't even have to get online to get it,
5023000	5029000	and a motion controller is supposed to be coming with it along with some compatible mini games that have been developed by Rare.
5030000	5037000	Now here's where it gets weird, apparently this controller is also supposed to be sold separately with even more mini games by Rare.
5037000	5044000	So I don't know, the controller though is supposedly going to work with any Xbox 360 that's already out there,
5045000	5047000	so it's not like you have to get a new Xbox just to have this motion controller.
5048000	5051000	I don't know, fact or crap? I say it's crap.
5052000	5060000	If it actually does happen, it will have to happen by the end of October.
5060000	5067000	Because the end of October is when Microsoft has to announce this as Penny Arcade or E4A in other words.
5068000	5070000	I mean I can't imagine they would just keep it a freaking secret.
5071000	5075000	They would want everybody in the whole freaking world to know that this is coming,
5076000	5083000	and I don't know why they'd bother to put out a new SKU to lower the price to $199 unless they're trying to clear the shelves of the existing arcade units.
5084000	5085000	That's as far as I can believe.
5085000	5089000	I don't think so, because if they were going to release, if they were going to try to clear off the shelves of arcade units,
5090000	5095000	they would have dropped it down to $199 and this would come out at $239 or whatever.
5096000	5100000	What's going to happen though is it does have to come out though by the end of October,
5101000	5105000	because the end of October is when the new scenic game comes out and it has Avatar support already built in.
5106000	5112000	So the new firmware update is coming out before that, and if this firmware update is being included on the actual console,
5112000	5114000	it has to come out before the end of October.
5115000	5120000	But still Loki, September 7th, then they're not going to do two SKU things back to back like that.
5121000	5127000	But they're going to do this because including the 512 megabyte memory unit makes it on par with Nintendo's system,
5128000	5130000	and it's cheaper and it has motion controlled stuff.
5131000	5137000	But I just, why would Microsoft not say anything official about this and then drop this on us on September 7th?
5138000	5139000	Doesn't that seem a little bit far fetched?
5139000	5141000	Unless they're going to reveal it at Penny Arcade Expo, but I somehow doubt it.
5142000	5143000	I somehow doubt it too.
5144000	5148000	I don't know. Price drop probably. Motion controls, I don't know.
5149000	5151000	Dark Sakura, any interest in motion control on 360 at all?
5152000	5153000	Not really.
5154000	5157000	I mean, is it just because maybe it's like, yeah, I've been there, done that at this point?
5158000	5159000	I hated it on PS3.
5160000	5163000	Oh, with the whole six axis. Oh true, you always forget about that.
5163000	5175000	And honestly, I don't really play that many Wii games, you know. I don't really enjoy them as much using the controller that way, so I'm not excited.
5176000	5177000	Alright, well, we'll see what happens.
5178000	5182000	ActDeft in chat says, Microsoft Smart, they will make the arcade have the 20 gigabyte drive.
5183000	5185000	I don't know, as long as they keep selling that separately, why not?
5186000	5188000	But then again, it makes a lot of sense because Microsoft's trying to do a lot more digital distribution.
5189000	5190000	I don't know. We'll see.
5190000	5202000	Well, speaking of other Microsoft stuff, there was, at the Leipzig convention, a controller that was almost identical except for being kind of a pukey green color.
5203000	5212000	That had corrected a D-pad. Supposed to be a lot more easy to use, better control on it.
5212000	5231000	And it was supposed to be, you know, coming out along with Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 and, you know, people were pretty excited about it except that it was stated to be a limited edition promotional item that is going to be out on October 24th.
5232000	5238000	However, it's as long as supplies last and only available in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
5238000	5247000	I think the color of that controller is limited edition. I think if they're going to fix the controller, they're not just going to fix it on some and just say forget it.
5248000	5255000	I hope you're right, Loki, because I know when I first heard about this news that Darth Sireth was telling us, I was like, why won't they just fix it across the board?
5255000	5269000	Okay, here's why I know that it's just the colors. Because the colors, the red and that ugly green are coming out. They were announced at E3 because they're coming out as well around the time of Gears of War.
5270000	5281000	I think it's actually at the end of October also. So if they decide to redesign the controller, those colors will probably be limited edition for a while because they already announced that those were going to be limited.
5281000	5293000	And then they'll probably just tweak the whole controller because there's no reason to make an entirely different mold and circuit board setup or whatever they have to do for the Xbox 360 controller.
5294000	5300000	Fix the problem and just say, okay, we're done. No more fixing. They're just going to fix it. Period.
5300000	5311000	I hope you're right. I would love, you know, although I kind of resent the fact I'm going to have to buy a whole new Xbox 360 controller to fix what was essentially their crappy D-pad, but I'll do it because I mean, I don't know how you guys feel.
5312000	5321000	I hate that D-pad on the Xbox. I mean, it really does take away from some of those games. I don't know how you guys feel, but I hate it. Do you use that control pad a lot?
5322000	5323000	I don't really hate it.
5324000	5327000	I can't stand it. It does not feel nearly as slick as Sony's pad.
5327000	5332000	No, that's true, but I never had a problem with it really. Not that much of a problem.
5333000	5335000	Alright. Well, there you have it.
5336000	5343000	It should be like the Wii D-pad. That'd be awesome. But, you know, we're never going to see it.
5344000	5351000	Just a little more defined when you push it in different directions. I mean, seriously, playing Soul Calibur or any fighting game with that stinks.
5351000	5357000	Yeah. So Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts. That's going to be coming out this fall.
5358000	5369000	And kind of with that is a little bonus. You actually get early access to the Banjo-Kazooie Xbox Live Arcade game release early and you get it for free.
5369000	5385000	So that's pretty awesome. And Banjo-Kazooie, of course, coming out for $40. If I remember correctly, mid-November. That would be like the 17th or 16th? I don't remember.
5386000	5389000	I don't know. It's kind of neat. Not my game.
5390000	5391000	Not my thing.
5392000	5393000	No, seriously.
5394000	5396000	There's tons of Banjo-Kazooie fans out there that I'm sure are very excited about.
5396000	5400000	It's not... I don't know. I have to go back and play Cameo.
5401000	5402000	You're going to go back and play Cameo?
5403000	5404000	I think I should.
5405000	5410000	Why? Just to get the achievement points. Admit it, Loki. That's what you want to do. You want to go back and get the achievement points.
5411000	5417000	Yeah, I do. But also I want to just play through the game because it was supposed to be pretty cool.
5417000	5427000	Alright. Also coming out to Xbox Live Arcade some day is a Lode Runner remake. I think we've talked about this on the show before because I seem to remember rumblings of this a while back.
5428000	5436000	I don't know how many of you remember this old game. It's a real classic game from the 80s personal computing era. They had it on Apple IIe. I had this game on Commodore 64.
5436000	5446000	Basically it was a very simple game with little sticks. It was kind of like a puzzle slash action game. You play this little stick man who ran around and there were ladders and monkey bars that you could kind of crawl across.
5447000	5452000	But what you would know this game best for was how you could dig a hole in the bricks and fall through them in a certain strategy.
5453000	5461000	By the way, if you've never played this game before, the TurboGrafx version I believe is on a virtual console. Like there's a version of it that's on any... sorry, Wii's virtual console.
5461000	5473000	Well apparently an Xbox Live Arcade remake is going on right now and IGN actually found this at the Leipzig show going on that there is a build of the arcade version that apparently is just about done.
5474000	5480000	Ready to go. So it's coming somewhat soon. Maybe before the holidays. I don't know.
5481000	5484000	They've got a lot of good releases coming on Xbox Live Arcade.
5484000	5490000	You know, I don't know though. I've got to admit, Lode Runner is kind of one of those 80's early games that was a lot of fun back in the day.
5491000	5495000	But I think if you played it now, I think the nostalgia would be gone soon unless they've made a lot of updates and changes to it.
5496000	5505000	This game has gone through a lot of different stages. There was a version put out in the early 90's, I want to say by Sierra, on Windows 95 or 3.1. I don't remember.
5506000	5509000	There was a kind of version with souped up graphics that added some stuff to it.
5509000	5519000	So, I don't know. Queltipo in chat says, Lode Runner was the game of choice in my school library. Ours was Monzuma Revenge in the early early days.
5520000	5524000	And then when I got into junior high school, Scorched Earth. It's all about Scorched Earth.
5525000	5526000	Kix. Kix.
5527000	5528000	Sorry, Kix is what I was playing in school.
5529000	5531000	Well, you had to issue Classic Game of the Week a few weeks ago for a reason.
5532000	5536000	You saw that they're making a Scorched Earth type game that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
5536000	5543000	That's awesome. I hope it has. You know like, Worms is kind of like Scorched Earth though.
5544000	5553000	But I want something that's really scaled back a bit in terms of you are a tank, you do not move.
5554000	5559000	I love the craziness of Scorched Earth. Remember how you could get those nuclear bombs that would blow up off the screen?
5560000	5561000	That was what I was talking about.
5561000	5565000	Just port Scorched Earth to Xbox Live Arcade. There would be a heck of people that would play it.
5566000	5571000	There was another one too, VGA Tank or something like that. There was a game just like it that came first.
5572000	5576000	Whatever happened to Scorched Earth? What a great game.
5577000	5580000	Alright, well anyhow, Lode Runner is also coming to Xbox Live Arcade soon.
5581000	5587000	Well, there are certain people who I believe need anger management issues.
5587000	5597000	Well, need anger management training. Well, not really so much as just need to not take out their frustrations on the inanimate object.
5598000	5608000	However, there was a man who had warned his three sons about how they were misbehaving while playing their Xbox.
5608000	5618000	And this is an old monstrosity, humongous Xbox. And so, he took their Xbox and nailed it to a tree.
5619000	5624000	Ripped out the circuit board and everything and nailed it to a tree.
5625000	5629000	Just like Jesus. Stop it. That must have been a big nail.
5629000	5637000	And their mother is saying that the problem was addressed properly. I think it was addressed very poorly.
5638000	5644000	And if they feel like wasting however much it cost at the time, feel free to waste the money all you want to.
5645000	5651000	However, they are putting the nailed to a tree Xbox.
5651000	5662000	Well, I should say the, or maybe as Loki was saying, the Jesus Edition Xbox on eBay. It's on an auction right now.
5663000	5667000	Of course, because people are retarded and will pay lots of money for that crap. Remember that one? There was a kid...
5668000	5669000	I was still, actually there was more to that.
5670000	5671000	Sorry.
5672000	5677000	Half of the proceeds are going to be going to their local schools and the other half will be going to the Children's College Fund.
5677000	5687000	I hope no one buys this at all. Remember that supposed story that someone's kid or whatever smoked pot and so they sold his guitar hero online?
5688000	5691000	And they got like over a thousand dollars for it.
5692000	5693000	Preposterous.
5694000	5698000	It was just retarded. I mean, people do not buy this thing. It's a broken Xbox and you're really going to pay good money for it?
5699000	5702000	I hope someone buys it because then I can laugh at them for being a big fucking idiot.
5702000	5712000	However, as was the most important question that rises from this as Joystiq asks, will it blend?
5713000	5714000	No.
5715000	5716000	I bet it will.
5717000	5718000	This type of idiocy will not blend.
5719000	5726000	Well, at any rate, I definitely, I want to find out who wins the auction just so that I can publicly ridicule them.
5727000	5728000	I need good laughing water.
5728000	5731000	Some people disagree. Shouran in chat says this dad kicks ass.
5732000	5738000	There you go. I find it interesting that it's funding the Kids College Fund though. It's kind of an interesting little side effect to it.
5739000	5745000	Alright. I hate to back up and go to the last story, but damn, I was curious and Bobby Blackwell filled me in as well on some stuff going on.
5746000	5753000	Apparently, there is a like Java version of Scorched Earth that you can play online and he actually gave me the address here scorched2000.com.
5753000	5757000	You can actually still play Scorched Earth and I was looking at Wikipedia though. I don't think that's an official port.
5758000	5770000	It's some type of clone game, but apparently, according to Wikipedia, back in 2005, the original developer said that more information on the official version might surface soon.
5771000	5778000	It was reiterated in 2006. Apparently, there's some type of Scorched Earth project that's been going on since March of 2006.
5778000	5784000	You can get a CD called Totally Scorched through the official website of Scorched Earth for 20 bucks.
5785000	5792000	I might have to see if I can find this guy and get him on the show. I think it would be awesome. I want to talk about Scorched Earth.
5793000	5799000	Alright. However, I do not want Xbox Tree Dad on our show. I think I would just not be able to control it.
5800000	5801000	I'd have to make fun of him too.
5801000	5809000	A little silly. I don't know. You're right. It's more the person who buys this than him. I mean, you know, however you want to parent your kids is your business.
5810000	5822000	I think that he was right to punish the children, but why not just put the functional Xbox on eBay and then that way you're getting money for selling a functional product?
5823000	5826000	Whatever happened to just taking the cord? Seriously?
5826000	5830000	See, that never worked with me because I would always find it.
5831000	5832000	It never worked with me either.
5833000	5842000	My mother took my TV away. This is how much of a brat I was. My mother took my TV away and I went and took it back and hooked everything back up and told her she couldn't do that because it was theft because she never bought it for me.
5842000	5856000	Better yet, and I know we're kind of contributing to this, why is this news? I know. I mean, seriously, it's like kids get punished in some creative way and I mean, who reported on this first?
5857000	5866000	I mean, obviously we reported on a story that someone else reported on, but did this like make the paper? I mean, is this like in Iowa or something, you know, where nothing happens?
5866000	5880000	The person who needs to actually make themselves a username instead of being OL army, recruit, whatever, just linked the article up, well, the eBay auction, I should say.
5881000	5882000	So it is...
5883000	5885000	Well, right now 850. So good. No one's really bidding on this.
5886000	5887000	Sick sad world.
5888000	5894000	But the user's name is blocked, whoever's bid on it. I don't know, part of me wants to go in or bid on this.
5894000	5898000	No, do not. I'm tempted. I'm so tempted.
5899000	5908000	All right. I just, what else do I want to say real quick about, ah, I forgot. Train derailed. Oh, well, we'll move on. Maybe I'll think of it later.
5909000	5910000	Did your train sink in the ocean?
5911000	5917000	Yes, it did. There was something else I wanted to say about this whole thing. Was it something I wanted to read and chat? I think it was.
5917000	5929000	Sorry. I'm sorry for the quietness. I'm reading the chat here. Joshi, Joshi 16 says, I don't believe it. This is a quick way to sell a broken console.
5930000	5931000	Very interesting.
5932000	5933000	I can just make up a cockamamie story about...
5934000	5935000	Yes.
5936000	5938000	Yes, and you get it on the news and people will do it.
5938000	5946000	But, see, I'm not an idiot that ruins my own systems. Everything that I have is still functional except for one 7800 that needs a new power supply.
5947000	5955000	Like, take a console system and say it's haunted or something and, like, come up with some sort of YouTube viral video and sell it.
5956000	5965000	Tiger Claw says, what the dad did was appalling. There was a perfectly good Xbox. The kids are going to be screwed when they find out their brand new Xbox 360 has limited backwards compatibility.
5965000	5975000	I know what I wanted to say earlier about the whole taking the cord thing. What I found out was that when my mom would take the cord to my Nintendo, that the cord from her VCR would work just fine in replacement.
5976000	5977000	Sony?
5978000	5987000	Yeah, it was the old RCA red, yellow things. They're all the same. So I would just take the cord from her VCR and it would work just fine in the Nintendo and she was not happy. Not happy.
5987000	5997000	I, you know, and I'm not condoning any other kids to be exactly as brat-tastic as I was. And dark tastic, yeah, the 7800s have a really weird power supply.
5998000	6006000	But they were also fairly unreliable as far as how well they stayed functional. So if you find a working one, you hold on to it.
6007000	6013000	But I was, I was, yeah, thank you, Bobby. I was a real big brat and I'm not ashamed of myself.
6013000	6017000	I have to read it. Bobby says you all, you were all brats. You should be ashamed. We really were.
6018000	6028000	I'm not ashamed because my bratliness meant that I actually had a brain and was willing to use it to my own benefit. And now that I'm an adult, I can use my brain even better.
6029000	6031000	Bobby says you will never grow up to amount to anything. Happy face.
6032000	6033000	Yeah, too many people said that. Look at me now.
6034000	6035000	Here we are on the internet. Alright, look at me now.
6036000	6037000	Yeah, well, I'm a celebrity on the internet, so whatever.
6037000	6042000	I do what I want. Alright, let's move on please, Loki, before we get too ghetto.
6043000	6049000	Well, something that's not going to amount to anything apparently is the 2008 edition of the Digital Life Expo.
6050000	6058000	It's been cancelled because of poor economic conditions. You people are too poor, so I don't know.
6058000	6069000	So, yes, apparently the last two years, you know, they had a significant gaming presence and facing lack of interest in the show.
6070000	6080000	In 2007, Ziff Davis' apparent strategy was to put more focus on gaming for the 2008 edition, but that's not going to happen this year obviously.
6081000	6084000	So, here's hoping for 2009.
6084000	6089000	So, just because of the recession, that's what they're chalking it up to?
6090000	6091000	Yep.
6092000	6094000	Huh. Well, I guess that's too bad.
6095000	6099000	Apparently the conventions run off of pure gasoline, and so, you know, gas price is going up.
6100000	6103000	I love that they had to use twigs and, you know, fire.
6103000	6114000	Alright, well, sorry to say, but Digital Life 2008 is cancelled.
6115000	6118000	There you go. For those of you that have already butchered plane tickets.
6119000	6128000	Anyhow, I'm sure we have a lot of New Yorkers who are very pissed off at the news that Digital Life 2008 is cancelled because there were some that used to always call in and talk to us about it.
6128000	6132000	So, in your honor, we will do the FUs of the Week right now.
6132000	6156000	My FU of the week goes towards my husband being at the GameCrazy Manager Conference in Las Vegas and me not being able to go to Las Vegas.
6156000	6166000	I'm sorry, did I say that out loud? Oops. But no, I actually do miss my boy a bit, and the sad thing is that he'll be coming back Wednesday, but we'll be leaving Thursday, so I actually have to miss my art class.
6167000	6172000	Like, maybe go to an hour of it, so I'm trying to think of how I can balance going to school and going to school.
6172000	6188000	Yeah, because you still have to get to the airport like an hour and a half early for all the check-ins and all that crap. So, fun fun.
6188000	6204000	Leave the house at four, because you've got traffic on top of that.
6204000	6231000	Lowkey, what are your FUs of the Week?
6231000	6242000	Like a normal American, I'm not going to take responsibility for it anyways.
6242000	6262000	This is why you play video games instead of real games.
6262000	6276000	As long as you're in direct sunlight for fifteen minutes, your body will make a sufficient amount of vitamin D, which you need to be healthy, so good for you being outside.
6276000	6293000	Um, I'll make my FUs short. Um, FU to breakups. They're no fun at all. We'll just leave it at that. The end. Let's go on, talk about other stuff, such as...
6293000	6309000	A stupid award to give away tonight. To this woman, Kimberly Jernigan. What the hell did she do?
6310000	6316000	Well, she played Second Life, but that's not the only reason why we're giving her one.
6316000	6328000	This is why we have to give a lot of people a stupid award. Apparently, here's the thing, she was actually having a romance in Second Life, and when her Second Life boyfriend guy dumped her or whatever...
6329000	6331000	Who was a lion. Or a tiger.
6331000	6351000	And bears, oh my. Apparently, here's what happened. The cops said that what this chick tried to do, she tried to kidnap her ex-boyfriend guy online, and he was some 52 year old guy, and he was a lion, and she was a human.
6351000	6366000	She tried not only to just kidnap him once, she tried to kidnap him three times. And she was driving up from North Carolina to come kidnap this guy or whatever, and she brought her dog with her the third time.
6366000	6382000	And so she cut the screen to get into this person's house, and was waiting for him to get home from work, and the dog kept barking, and so what did the gal do? She bound the dog and locked him in the bathroom.
6383000	6386000	So, F you to this lady right here for being so cruel to animals.
6386000	6399000	Finally, the lion guy gets home, and she had a pair of handcuffs with her, and a laser. Yes, that's right, a laser. Like, I'm gonna shine it in your eyes, you little bastard! I don't know.
6400000	6411000	So finally, she runs from the scene, leaving the poor dog behind. She did, by the way, get caught at a turnpike rest stop in the state of Maryland, and there it is.
6411000	6421000	There it is. I mean, you're not helping the whole stereotypes around Second Life players, seriously.
6421000	6441000	I was gonna say, there was also another one I had posted as part of, like, the Stupid Awards there, about some stupid kid who snuck onto his grandpa's eBay account and bought a Wii for almost 200,000 euros, and the funny thing was, he already had a Wii.
6442000	6445000	So parents, watch your kids, because they're bastards.
6445000	6454000	And in regards to our recipient of the Stupid Award this week, DJ Dark Knight in Chat says, that's a crazy bitch. I couldn't have said it any better myself.
6455000	6464000	I mean, is she really surprised that her relationship with the lion didn't work out? I mean, seriously, that wouldn't have ended well anyways, and think of what the babies would have looked like.
6465000	6470000	Footy Monster says she was gonna go pew pew pew on the lion dude. Seems like a flawless plan.
6470000	6481000	Mm-hmm. I am pleased to see, though, it's not just, you know, the guys becoming crazy and going after the women. You know, equal sexual representation here.
6482000	6484000	Women are capable of going crazy too, right Dark Sakura?
6485000	6486000	What do you mean by that?
6487000	6488000	Never mind.
6489000	6494000	You just need to stop that train of thought right there, and just be nice.
6495000	6497000	I'm always nice. I'm the king of nice on the internet.
6497000	6499000	The king of something.
6500000	6502000	Do we have more gaming news by chance?
6503000	6507000	Yes, and we have good gaming news. Very, very good gaming news.
6507000	6530000	As I'm sure everyone knows by now, I've been super, super excited about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Cross Generation, which is going to be out in Japan this year, and they're actually talking about bringing it out on Wii because they're saying that the title will be on a Wii-compatible board.
6530000	6537000	So, I don't know. I guess maybe. So that would be kind of neat.
6538000	6543000	But I would be afraid of what it would look like on the Wii because it doesn't look like a Nintendo 64 game right now.
6544000	6546000	I'm sorry, did I say that out loud? No, I'm kidding.
6547000	6549000	I think it would actually be okay on Wii. I think it would be alright.
6550000	6554000	But I don't want to play a fighting game on the Wii. I do not want to play a fighting game on the Wii.
6555000	6558000	Unless we, you know, maybe on the classic controller or something.
6558000	6559000	Or Smash Brothers.
6560000	6565000	I want this to be out on PS3 or Xbox 360. That's what I want.
6566000	6570000	I want an arcade machine in my house. Now.
6571000	6573000	How long until this game comes out?
6574000	6575000	Soon?
6576000	6577000	Fair enough.
6578000	6579000	We don't have much year left.
6580000	6584000	I guess that's true. That's true. So I'm sure Dark Soccer will be importing this sooner rather than later.
6584000	6587000	It's always next year. But, I don't know.
6588000	6589000	No!
6590000	6596000	So, it's another day and Nintendo's been sued again for the Wii.
6597000	6603000	Oh yes, someone else claims that they thought of the Wii first in Hillcrest Laboratories this time.
6604000	6608000	They are basically suing them for using their motion controller inventions.
6608000	6615000	And Hillcrest is seeking to block imports of the Wii and Wii Remote.
6616000	6618000	Why just imports? That's kind of weird.
6619000	6624000	And according to a complaint filed with the US International Trade Commission,
6625000	6631000	they are also filing a civil lawsuit in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland.
6632000	6636000	And it says, while Hillcrest Labs has a great deal of respect for Nintendo and the Wii,
6636000	6645000	Hillcrest Labs believes that Nintendo is in clear violation of its patent and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights.
6646000	6650000	And the three patents that they hold are for motion controller technology.
6651000	6653000	The fourth is for a graphic user interface.
6654000	6664000	And I guess they're behind the motion control technology of FreeSpace and a graphic interface called Home.
6664000	6669000	I don't know if that's the same as Sony's home, I assume not.
6670000	6676000	So, everybody wants a piece of the wee pie.
6677000	6679000	Apparently.
6680000	6684000	I think they should just go on Judge Judy and settle this all, don't you think?
6684000	6695000	Well, I mean, I don't know. I know patent lawsuits take a while, but seriously, it's like two years after this console's been out and you're just now suing them.
6696000	6706000	I mean, I have a hard time believing that they heard that this was coming out, they knew what it was, and they saw it come out, and it's using their technology,
6706000	6718000	and if they were legitimately trying to block them because they were planning on releasing something like that, I think they waited too long, and this is just a cry for money.
6719000	6722000	Can you imagine what it might be like if Nintendo and these guys did go to Judge Judy?
6723000	6725000	Get a life, you know, get a real job.
6729000	6731000	I eat morons like you up for breakfast.
6731000	6739000	You may live as, hopefully, as long as I'm, but you're not as smart as I am yet.
6740000	6743000	That's right, just as the American way on Judge Judy.
6744000	6745000	All right.
6746000	6754000	Well, hopefully Nintendo doesn't get too sued, or the game that Dark Soccer and I are most looking forward to, Animal Crossing City Folk, is never going to come out.
6755000	6756000	It has to!
6756000	6760000	Yes, it definitely has to. Well, here's some new things that have been announced about Animal Crossing City Folk.
6761000	6765000	I mean, not just, you know, what Loki talked to us about earlier, but apparently, here's some interesting things.
6766000	6773000	If you actually played Animal Crossing Wild World on the DS, you can now send your avatar from the DS game to the new game.
6774000	6777000	Also, you can take your travel data and actually download it to the DS.
6778000	6782000	So I'm wondering if that means that you can actually, like, take your Wii game, download the travel information to the DS, and go to a friend's house,
6782000	6786000	so that we don't have to haul, like, everything over, since there's, like, no memory cards, really, on the Wii.
6787000	6791000	I mean, I guess technically they have the SD card, but not a lot of people have that, so, kind of interesting.
6792000	6795000	My question, and this is kind of interesting, how the fuck would you do that?
6796000	6803000	Because if you, I guess you could, no, you can't even really save it to your DS, because there's no storage on the DS.
6805000	6806000	I don't know.
6806000	6812000	Unless they're hinting that there's storage on the DS, and they accidentally admitted to it.
6813000	6818000	Or there's extra storage data available on the cartridge, maybe?
6819000	6830000	Or why don't they have it where you can, I don't know, save it to an SD memory card, since there's an SD memory card slot on the damn machine that they don't use for anything? Seriously.
6830000	6837000	Well, anyhow, in a little less rantable news, holiday events are also coming back for the Wii.
6838000	6843000	Jingle the Reindeer comes back for Toy Day, which, you know, is just Christmas in a non-offensive way.
6844000	6849000	Apparently there's a new character, Zipper T. Bunny, who shows up for Bunny Day.
6850000	6856000	Hmm, I wonder what Bunny Day could be. Could it be a random Sunday between March and April? Who knows?
6856000	6862000	That was stolen from pagan religions. That was a fertility holiday.
6863000	6865000	Well, that would make sense that it's a rabbit.
6866000	6870000	Hi! Eggs, bunnies! It's a holiday about screwin'.
6871000	6877000	But really, we should really focus on the true nature of Animal Crossing, is that it hasn't changed in three games.
6878000	6880000	Look, all I want to know, can I still hit people with bug nets?
6881000	6882000	That's all I want to know.
6882000	6885000	I'm pretty sure you can't, because it hasn't changed in three games.
6886000	6892000	Alright. Every week you send us your love and adoration and cards and letters to our mailbag.
6893000	6898000	Mailbag at orangelandrater.com and DarkSakura opens up the old mailbag and reads some of her favorite emails.
6899000	6900000	But if I remember right, there's not a lot this week, is there?
6901000	6902000	There are three.
6903000	6904000	Which means we got an extra during the show.
6905000	6907000	Mailbag at orangelandrater.com if you'd like to send in your emails.
6908000	6909000	What? Uh oh.
6909000	6912000	Sauce just said Jesus died so he can eat chocolate.
6913000	6914000	Alright, let's open up the old mailbag.
6920000	6923000	The first email, um, it says, uh,
6923000	6939000	Dear C4 and Kagabra and the OLR crew, I've been listening to your show since, oh my god the spelling is atrocious, since episode 1 and I filled up my mp3 player for years and gave me all the gaming info before...
6943000	6944000	Bad grammar makes Jamie cry.
6944000	6956000	Before is not spelled letter B number 4, it's B-E-F-O-R-E. V is spelled T-H-E, not D-A. Magazines is spelled M-A-G-I-Z-I-N-E-S, not M-A-G-A-Z-E-E-N-S.
6957000	6958000	Ugh!
6959000	6963000	Did and saved me tons of cash in the year to buy, you spell anime right? What the fuck?
6964000	6970000	And manga, my collection, my girlfriend, cheer princess wants a D-S for PS, god use periods! I'm not reading this email.
6970000	6973000	No, you have to read the very end, because it does explain a little bit of the crappy email.
6974000	6980000	I know, but it was typed on a Wii, no spell or grammar check, well screw it! I don't need grammar check! And they make a thing called a dictionary.
6981000	6987000	Actually, they do have the mode where you type it in stuff, you start to type it in and it spells it for you, so...
6988000	6989000	That's lame.
6989000	6999000	You know, if I was all into the sound boards as much as the chat room thinks I am, this is the part where I would play the clip from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
7000000	7003000	You get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!
7004000	7005000	Next email.
7006000	7008000	Okay, now I'm gonna finish it, because I'm a nice person.
7009000	7010000	Alright.
7010000	7021000	I'm trying to be nicer to people, and I mean nothing bad against this person as a person, just don't be so fucking lazy. It's not hard, it doesn't take that much more time to type it.
7022000	7023000	Or to use your actual email.
7024000	7025000	Alright, yeah.
7025000	7039000	Okay. She loves MySpace and mystery and roleplay games, what should I get her? PSP or a DS? Get her a DS. And advice on how to get more than five listeners on my podcast, Pokefan Radio.
7039000	7055000	You know, advertise, dude. Go out and whore yourself out. We used to post on all these different message boards and put a link to our podcast and our radio station and our signatures and just posted the fuck out of them, so go for that.
7056000	7057000	That's what you should do.
7058000	7067000	And I feel bad that you have a level 70 and your girlfriend only has a level 10, but you do need to study.
7067000	7080000	You know, to translate his email into English, he says that his girlfriend says to log off and study or he's gonna drop out and live in his mother's basement.
7081000	7086000	And that he sleeps in class. Your email is quite evident of this.
7087000	7095000	It's really a good idea if you log off of World of Warcraft and pay more attention in English class. Please.
7095000	7106000	Please. I'm urging you to take the goddamn time to pay attention and to spell shit right and use periods.
7107000	7109000	He used one period. Okay, I'm impressed. He used one.
7110000	7116000	Oops, sorry about that. You just got a break in the podcast there. We had some live difficulties in the studio when I tried to play a sound clip.
7117000	7123000	It screwed up the recording of the show. Right in the middle of Jamie's rant, which is probably to the blessing of the email.
7123000	7130000	Hey! Well, during the middle of this though, Loki and I made some special announcements that only the live listeners get to hear.
7131000	7134000	There you go. All the more reason to tune in live Sunday nights.
7134000	7156000	Yeah. So, next email. Dun dun dun. Just in case you guys needed some mail. Thank you, cause we did. Anyways, I'm a new listener. A.K.A. the 56 care came in on episode 283, but just wanted to say what's up. Your show is the best. I need to get all the back episodes as possible, being as it's the only thing that gets me through the night at work.
7156000	7163000	You guys rock. Keep on doing your thing and I'll keep on listening. I'm gonna try to change my hours at work so I can tune in live on Sundays. I'll let you know how that goes anyway later.
7164000	7172000	Also, you need to use capitalization and punctuation and through is spelled T-H-R-O-U-G-H, not T-H-R-E-W.
7173000	7180000	But thanks for listening. But seriously, it's time to go broadband. I mean, if you're still on 56k, you poor thing. Poor, poor thing.
7180000	7192000	I know. But, you know, I provide these grammar and spelling lessons as a public service. It's free. I am trying to better the world through proper grammar and spelling.
7193000	7194000	One word at a time.
7194000	7212000	Exactly. Last email, I think. Regarding your latest PSA, if Triple H retires from wrestling, would it be acceptable to walk up to McMahon and say you just lost the game? Didn't think so. I love wrestling jokes, really. That made me laugh.
7213000	7214000	Blink, blink, blink, blink.
7215000	7218000	Rob doesn't watch wrestling. He likes glow. The gorgeous ladies of wrestling.
7219000	7220000	Yeah, I like watching-
7221000	7222000	And it's all about Godiva.
7222000	7234000	I like watching lady wrestling. One night at Rocky Horror, we actually did a wrestling themed night at Rocky Horror Picture Show. We did a TLC match. We did a tables, ladders, and cookie sheets. It was fun.
7235000	7236000	That sounds pretty great.
7237000	7237000	It was pretty awesome.
7238000	7239000	Also, also, also, last part to this.
7240000	7242000	I got to play the A-hole guy that's in charge of the W-D- what's his name?
7243000	7243000	He has to be McMahon.
7244000	7246000	McMahon. Yeah, but we changed everybody's name slightly, so I was him.
7246000	7254000	Also, is it acceptable to be offended by people being offended? What about being offended by people being- this is from Robert M.
7255000	7261000	You know what, just everyone needs to learn how to get over themselves and be a little bit more accepting of everybody else around them.
7262000	7263000	The end!
7264000	7273000	If you want to send us some emails and get Taunted by Jamie, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com. Have your spelling and grammar evaluated.
7273000	7276000	I corrected my teacher!
7277000	7281000	You should start grading their emails based on their spelling and grammar.
7282000	7283000	Well, those last two just got an E.
7284000	7300000	Look, well not the very last one, but my teacher put in the syllabus that if we can ever find any spelling or grammatical errors that he puts in any of the documentation he puts out on the website for my painter class, then we get an extra bonus point for class.
7300000	7306000	And I found one right away and emailed it to him, so I now have a bonus point for the class. We hadn't even done anything.
7307000	7313000	Alright, let's get back to gaming news before we turn into the grammar podcast or whatever.
7314000	7315000	There's a really good one too!
7316000	7318000	We inspire you all to do more gooder on your emails.
7318000	7338000	Alright, Loki. Well, yet another rumor that came true. The PSP 3000 was announced at Leipzig this week, and like the rumors had stated, it has a built-in microphone and a PlayStation button instead of a home button.
7338000	7354000	Other changes that have happened, the LCD screen is a lot more responsive and also a little bit brighter or easily viewed in the highlight situations.
7354000	7369000	And supposedly they're going to be updating the core pack, which will be coming out in November, which will come with a black system, a 4GB memory stick, and a voucher for everyday shooter.
7370000	7380000	And what's kind of neat also, the PSP 3000 is a little bit more rounded, but that's basically it.
7380000	7384000	And it comes with pie. And that's why I want one.
7385000	7386000	No, the pie is a lie.
7387000	7389000	What? No free Marie Callender's pie? What's up with that?
7390000	7391000	I don't know.
7392000	7395000	I just thought with everything else they were throwing in, maybe they'd throw in a pie. Who doesn't like pie?
7396000	7397000	I don't like pie.
7398000	7399000	Well, you're the devil.
7400000	7401000	Rob, let's go get pie.
7402000	7403000	Pie would be amazing right now.
7404000	7405000	It would be. And I have to drown my sorrows in pie.
7405000	7411000	I gotta move on. You can drown your sorrows in two new games coming out. They're coming out on the PSP, but here's the neat thing about it.
7412000	7418000	These games are not only going to be hitting stores for the PSP, they're actually going to hit PSN at the exact same time. In Japan, anyway.
7419000	7420000	And it's all happening in October.
7421000	7431000	The games that are going to be released simultaneously, Bleach Soul Carnival, because you just need another Bleach game, and Yusha no Kusei ni Namikadikida is coming out.
7431000	7438000	Digital distribution and the exact same day a PSP retail counterpart, exact same time.
7439000	7443000	Both versions are only going to send you back 1000 yen. That's about $10 or so.
7444000	7445000	So, kind of interesting there.
7446000	7448000	Oh, I'm sorry. I take that back. The downloadable version is actually $10 less.
7449000	7453000	So, huh. I wonder if, you know, because there's no case, no manual, no disc, whatever.
7454000	7457000	So, kind of interesting there, the approach they're taking.
7458000	7459000	I don't know if that's a dangerous one or what.
7459000	7467000	But, it's happening in Japan, not here, so it'll be interesting to see if it sets any precedence for here or if they try to do something similar here.
7468000	7469000	Who knows? We'll see.
7470000	7471000	I'm sorry, I gotta say this.
7472000	7473000	May Satsuma in chat says this.
7474000	7478000	PSP 3000 came with Pi. It should be called PSP 3.14 then.
7479000	7481000	Nice. I get it. I see what you did there.
7482000	7483000	Good job.
7484000	7485000	Math joke.
7486000	7487000	I love math jokes.
7487000	7488000	Okay.
7489000	7495000	I know I have mentioned this before that there, in Brazil, there is a big following for the Mega Drive.
7496000	7506000	To the extent that even some games that were released on the Sega Genesis were actually released in Brazil on the Master System because it was so popular.
7507000	7515000	Well, now, because it's still popular, what has been released now by Tech Toy, which is a Sega licensee,
7515000	7528000	the Master System 3 is now out and it looks sort of like an old Genesis and it has a Sonic painted on it in blue, like an outline Sonic.
7529000	7540000	It has 131 built-in games on it, G-rated games, so it has no cartridge slot and retails for about $133.
7540000	7546000	It actually, and I'm going to the webpage to see if it's hopefully not written in Portuguese.
7547000	7550000	Okay, some of the games that are on it.
7551000	7556000	Shadow Dancer, which was one of the really good Shinobi games.
7557000	7561000	Alice Kid in Miracle World, Shinobi World, Lost Stars, High Tech World, those.
7562000	7567000	You also have Enduro Racer, E-SWAT, which was one of those games that was downgraded.
7567000	7572000	Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2, Fantasy Zone 3, Golden Axe, hang on.
7573000	7577000	Ken Seiden, what's another good one that was on here?
7578000	7589000	Thunder Blade, Super Space Invaders, Sonic Drift 2, and Rainbow Islands, Rastan Saga.
7590000	7592000	Lots of good stuff.
7593000	7595000	Huh, well...
7595000	7597000	Oh, and Battle Outrun.
7598000	7604000	You know, hey, there's lots of folks that love the nostalgia. I'm sure if they released something like that up here, some people would buy it.
7605000	7610000	Because hey, they do those, the Genesis controller type things that have all the Sonic games in them, those sell really well.
7611000	7620000	I'll have to tell you, Rob, I actually am very, even though I have almost all of the games on the list that were out as actual Master System games,
7620000	7625000	I'm actually considering that this might be a worthwhile purchase for my house.
7626000	7628000	Why not? Add it to the museum.
7629000	7635000	You can actually download a lot of them emulated, and really, they're very solid ports of the games.
7636000	7644000	There's even, I believe, a copy of Strider that came out on Master System in Brazil that was supposed to be pretty darn good for a Master System game.
7644000	7649000	I'd like to hear from some of our Brazilian listeners. Let us know what you think of this.
7650000	7651000	Do we have any Brazilian listeners?
7652000	7653000	I think we do.
7654000	7656000	You don't even have to tell us what you think of this. Just say, hi, I'm from Brazil, because I'm curious if we actually have listeners there.
7657000	7658000	Alright, moving on.
7659000	7664000	Right, we've got a bunch of homebrew news and hacking news to tell you about.
7665000	7668000	So, real quickly, I mentioned four things that are kind of neat.
7668000	7676000	First, Sailor Moon. Apparently, there's some guy making a few homebrew Sailor Moon games,
7677000	7684000	some of which are going to be on the Wii, and they are sprite-based brawlers, which is kind of interesting.
7685000	7691000	Well, they've released actual Sailor Moon fighting games. My first important game was the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game.
7691000	7703000	But, what's even bigger than that, of course, and how we cannot forget this, the Wii has been hacked to allow DVD video playback.
7703000	7720000	There's a patch, well actually, you can install a program using the homebrew channel, and it will allow you to play DVDs, like DVD movies.
7720000	7733000	And also, they have enabled DVD-capable homebrew programs, such as Nintendo 64 emulators that can read ROMs straight off of a DVD disc.
7734000	7737000	So, way to go beating Nintendo at their own game.
7738000	7742000	That is actually all kinds of funny, I have to admit. Come on, who isn't thinking this is hilarious?
7742000	7751000	For the DS, there are some interesting homebrew games out there. One that I thought looked really weird was Magnetic Shaving Derby.
7752000	7763000	Basically, you control a magnet using your DS stylus, and you attract a razor blade across a weird-looking face, and try not to cut the guy.
7763000	7779000	So, I don't know. That's kind of interesting. If that's not your cup of tea, then maybe you should check out one of the many games that are available, thanks to the Nioh Summer Coding Competition 2008.
7779000	7793000	They have lots of cool games for the DS, Game Boy Advance, and the PSP, and they're all homebrew, including updates, of course, to still-live DS.
7794000	7803000	There's some other neat things. There's some sort of, I don't know, chess game. They've got some puzzle games.
7803000	7812000	Lots of neat-looking stuff. There's some platformers in there. Lots of cool stuff to check out, especially if you have homebrew-enabled portable systems.
7813000	7817000	And you can find that on the forums of neoflash.com.
7818000	7823000	Lots of stuff going on in the hacking and homebrew world this week. We DVD players sometimes.
7824000	7826000	And we'll have some more stuff for Last Minute Stories as well.
7826000	7832000	Alright, well then, before we get to Last Minute Stories, we've got one more story for you before we open up the Skype line.
7833000	7836000	And by the way, tonight's Skype line is only accessible tonight at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
7837000	7840000	The 800 number is down. It's not the 800 number that's down. Our Skype end number is down.
7841000	7843000	Because I failed at renewing it on time, so I'll have to do that after the show.
7844000	7848000	So tonight, guys, we can only get access through the Orange Lounge Radio username on Skype.
7849000	7850000	That's how the majority of you are calling us anyway.
7850000	7861000	Something that has been announced at X08 in Toronto. Duke Nukem 3D is coming out for the Xbox Live Arcade sometime in September.
7862000	7864000	Which is pretty cool, because that means, like, soon.
7865000	7871000	And new to Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade? A saved film and gameplay rewind feature.
7872000	7876000	I mean, if you thought it was cool in Braid, it's going to be even more awesome when you can actually just rewind.
7876000	7884000	I don't know if it's the touch of a button or how that's going to work, but you'll actually be able to rewind gameplay if you want to undo something you screwed up.
7885000	7887000	And then if you want to share...
7888000	7889000	Like with an emulator?
7890000	7891000	I guess so. Which is kind of neat.
7892000	7899000	You can also save films, like if you have an especially memorable time that you shot a stripper and you want to share it with your friends, you could put it on a film.
7899000	7907000	And YouTube's galore! Just wait for it. Duke Nukem 3D. I hope the graphics are getting a little bit of a touch up, though.
7908000	7910000	That's one thing I'm kind of looking forward to.
7911000	7916000	Alright, if you want to give us a call, you can on the Skype line. OrangeLoungeRadio is our username on Skype.
7917000	7924000	Please, if you're going to use Skype to give us a call, please make sure you've contacted Echo123 at some point before you call us. It's already ringing.
7925000	7926000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
7926000	7928000	Hey, hey, it's Ronmo.
7929000	7931000	Well, hello! You always seem to get through first. What's on your mind, buddy?
7932000	7937000	Not too much. I have a few things I want to discuss. I'll make everything as quick as possible.
7938000	7938000	Sure.
7939000	7951000	I remember as a kid, I got in trouble for doing something stupid and my mother grabbed my new Tetris 2 game, the power adapter, and both my controllers and sent me off somewhere.
7951000	7957000	When she left, I waited about a good hour after she left the house, I went and found myself and hooked it back up.
7958000	7960000	She probably was not happy when she got back home.
7961000	7967000	Yeah, there's still a mark on the back of my back as a reminder when she discovered what I did.
7968000	7972000	Ouch, sorry to hear it, but bad boy, bad boy.
7974000	7975000	What else is on your mind?
7975000	7993000	That was then, but as for this whole digital life thing, my theory is that because digital life is the same weekend as New York Anime Festival and the people that run NYAF, real expeditions, need a large space, I don't think it was able to accommodate. That's my theory.
7994000	8002000	Interesting. You don't think it has anything to do with just competing expos or maybe general, like a lot of folks say that digital life was not all that last year.
8002000	8007000	I would think if it's conflicting space issues that they could, I don't know, reschedule.
8008000	8015000	Yeah, because the thing was, all the second floor was going to be digital life and downstairs was going to be NYAF.
8016000	8021000	But from what I'm hearing, NYAF is going to be the entire second floor like Comic Con was this past year.
8022000	8029000	And from my understanding that they were letting people have free passes to digital life, so you know, I went last year and I had a great time.
8029000	8034000	Well, who knows? I mean, I guess they are rescheduling it for 2009.
8035000	8037000	No sweat off my back.
8038000	8041000	Well, you know, it sucks to be the DDR people who are all excited about it.
8042000	8045000	Exactly. For them, there's Dave & Busses and Chinatown Fair.
8046000	8047000	Exactly. Anything else, Rama?
8048000	8055000	Quick wrap-up of Otacon, because I know the Rob D is trying to call in to cover the game room aspect of it, so we went this year and it was great.
8055000	8063000	What about, since you're an anime expert, what were some of the good cosplays you saw? Actually, I'm curious about video game cosplay specifically, though.
8064000	8073000	There was more video gaming cosplay at Otacon than anime cosplay. The most popular was, believe it or not, Super Mario Bros.
8074000	8076000	Everybody was running around as Mario or Luigi. That was the thing this year.
8076000	8087000	Interesting. Kind of seems a little like a standard. You know, it's kind of like expecting to see, you're going to see a Naruto at some point or a Sailor Moon.
8088000	8095000	Yeah, there was some Sailor Moon cosplays, a lot of Naruto cosplays. I mean, there wasn't even as many Final Fantasy cosplays this year as normally.
8096000	8104000	It's like, I guess, retro video gaming is a big thing, and my theory is after Super Mario Bros. came out, everybody wants to do Mario Bros. cosplay.
8104000	8111000	Plus, it's not that difficult, all things considered. I mean, it might be kind of complicated to do a really good one.
8112000	8114000	If you really want to be precise, you get someone to make the nice hat, the gloves, but you know.
8115000	8122000	Right, right. Well, Rama, thank you so much for the varied call tonight.
8123000	8124000	Of course, of course.
8125000	8128000	Alright, have a good one, and have fun at that New York Anime Festival. It should be fun.
8129000	8130000	Later, I will.
8130000	8135000	Bye-bye. If you want to give us a call, OrangeLoungeRadio is our username on Skype. Our 800 number is down tonight.
8136000	8139000	It will be back in a couple weeks when we're back live taking calls.
8140000	8142000	Hi, on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8143000	8144000	Hey, what's up? It's the Rob D.
8145000	8148000	Well, hey, speak of the devil. Rama just talked about you in the last call, so you went to Otakon this year.
8149000	8152000	Indeed I did. I took the 12 hour drive over to Baltimore, and that was rough.
8153000	8153000	Wow.
8153000	8159000	Especially going through Ohio. No offense to anyone. Actually, no complete offense to everyone in Ohio. Ohio sucked to drive through.
8160000	8165000	It can't be as bad as some of the West Coast states to drive through. Like, have you ever really driven through New Mexico?
8166000	8167000	No, I haven't.
8168000	8171000	There are some very beautiful parts of New Mexico, don't get me wrong. No offense to the people that live there.
8172000	8179000	But there's some parts of New Mexico that are like, damn. Or just anything east of Reno or Las Vegas and Nevada. It's pretty terrible, too.
8179000	8183000	Well, and we got a ticket while we were driving through Ohio, so that kind of taints my view on things, too.
8184000	8185000	Ouch. Yeah, that'd do it.
8186000	8192000	That's something that was beautiful. But, as for the con itself, I posted the link to my photo album in chat, my photo bucket.
8193000	8200000	I went through some stuff. I actually see me dressed up as Terry Beauregard, which, I gotta say, I've been to Anime Central, and I went to Otakon this year.
8201000	8207000	And I got a much better response over at Otakon. I had people, I couldn't actually take like, I don't know, 20 steps through the convention without someone yelling,
8207000	8210000	Are you okay? Or, hey, come on, come on, at me.
8211000	8212000	Nice.
8213000	8215000	It was fun. But the game room was huge.
8216000	8221000	Is it just because, you know, as Ramo was saying, there's more people doing video game cosplay this year, or do you think that's why more people recognize you?
8222000	8227000	Ha, I like this Metal Gear one. That's great. Two people put their little faces in a transmitter cutout there. Love it.
8228000	8231000	Yeah, especially with the name reference, too, with Otakon and Otakon.
8232000	8233000	Ah, true, true.
8233000	8240000	I don't know, there was a lot of anime stuff. I actually kept an account of how many Shinigami versus how many Akatsuki I saw, you know, from Bleaching Naruto.
8241000	8243000	It ended up being tied at 154.
8245000	8251000	Wow, I'm trying to, I, okay, wait, I found one of your Terry Beauregard, there, oh, you even got the hat there that says Fatal Fury.
8252000	8253000	You cannot have the hat.
8254000	8258000	Whether it's the metal plate for Fatal Fury, or whether it says Neo Geo or Fatal Fury, you gotta have it.
8259000	8261000	Let's see, what else is there that you got pictures of here?
8261000	8263000	Lucas from Mother 3, I want to see that one.
8264000	8270000	Ah, I'm looking at your photo bucket, your username on photo bucket if other people want to look at this, it's TheReabd.
8271000	8273000	The Reabd, because someone already had TheReabd, so.
8274000	8274000	Oh, what a jerk.
8275000	8276000	It's T-H-E-R-E-A-B-O-D.
8277000	8278000	Nice, Aness and Lucas.
8279000	8281000	Yeah, I've got a pyramid hat. You can actually see Rama, and there's a black mage, too.
8282000	8282000	Really?
8283000	8286000	Yes, ah, you can look at the tags on the left. I have a tag that's Rama.
8286000	8290000	Oh, he's got a new outfit.
8291000	8292000	In the dealer's room.
8293000	8294000	Nice, don't call him Heedy.
8295000	8297000	Oh, there's Rama, O-L-R.
8298000	8301000	Oh, no, that's the old one I knew. Okay, you have two black mages in there.
8302000	8305000	Oh, interesting. Sorry, this is making for a horrible radio, so.
8306000	8307000	But definitely lots of video game cosplay.
8308000	8311000	The game room was gigantic. There's actually a couple, a YouTube video, I think, of the game room.
8311000	8318000	Much, much bigger than the one over at ASN, but this one had pretty much an entire, I don't even know how to put it.
8319000	8324000	Probably about, if you took a Sam's Club and split it in half, that half would be how big the game room was.
8325000	8329000	Or a Costco, or whatever your regional giant bulk store would be.
8330000	8333000	And they had everything. Lots of shooters, lots of fighting games.
8334000	8336000	Mostly, you know, most of the anime-related stuff.
8337000	8338000	Fatal Fury, Street Fighter.
8338000	8343000	I saw two people dressed up as Kenso from King of Fighters, which confused the heck out of me, because...
8344000	8345000	Kenso? Really?
8346000	8347000	That's cool.
8348000	8351000	And they kind of wanted to hang out with me since they found another guy with KOF cosplay, but...
8352000	8353000	Oh well.
8354000	8355000	I used to do Leona cosplay.
8356000	8357000	Look at YouTube here, just looks like a big line.
8358000	8360000	Let's see, I'm trying to find, let's see.
8361000	8363000	Yeah, I guess there's a huge line to get in the game room.
8363000	8369000	I've never seen a Leona cosplayer. That would have been nice, because a friend of mine and I went as Ralph and Clark to ASUN.
8370000	8379000	Well, at Anime Expo, two of my friends that I used to hang out with online, who each had a Ralph and Clark name for a while,
8380000	8386000	we ended up going for the big KOF meet there, but my costume is about three sizes too big for me now.
8387000	8389000	But I was thinking about remaking it.
8389000	8395000	Yeah, I think my favorite picture in that whole album is of Sergeant Frog as L from Death Note.
8396000	8397000	So great.
8398000	8399000	That's cool.
8400000	8404000	But again, the game room, lots of stuff, lots of rhythm games, you know, again, it's pretty much all rhythm and fighting games.
8405000	8412000	Tons of people playing Brawl, I think they probably had like, I don't even know, eight or twelve TVs, giant HGTVs playing Brawl.
8412000	8421000	Gears of War, Halo 3, and Call of Duty 4 were there, which surprised me a little bit, but you know, you've got a lot of people that like to play that online, so it's not too shocking, I suppose.
8423000	8431000	Pretty much any fighting game you could ever want. KOF 98 on Neo Geo, KOF 11, what else, Marvel vs. Capcom.
8432000	8437000	I think I said I had one KVN, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Capcom vs. SNK 2, even Street Fighter Alpha 3 was there.
8437000	8444000	So it's just fighting game heaven, but that doesn't surprise me really, considering, you know, it's, you know, anime con and all that.
8445000	8451000	Yeah, lots of rhythm games, Pop'n Music, DDR, I saw Beatmania there, what else?
8452000	8456000	Oh, and the best part about that was that those were hooked up to standard TVs instead of HDTVs, just so you didn't have the lag.
8457000	8465000	What do you think of, speaking of Pop'n Music, what do you think of, I don't know if you were here during Part A, we talked about Beat'n Groovy, the Xbox Live Arcade port of Pop'n Music.
8465000	8468000	I didn't hear about that. What's it gonna have on there?
8469000	8470000	Oh god, it's gonna be interesting.
8471000	8473000	I don't know how that'll really work with the Xbox 360 controller.
8474000	8475000	Yeah, especially with that D-Pad.
8476000	8484000	Well, not really my thing, and I wouldn't expect it to work very well, especially since, is there even a 360 Pop'n Music controller? I doubt it.
8485000	8489000	No, no. So it's gonna be different. Let's just leave it at that.
8490000	8493000	Alright, RobD, anything else you wanna share about Otacon with us?
8493000	8499000	I've got tons of stories, but honestly, nothing really short enough to say here.
8500000	8501000	Well, except the Kool-Aid Man made it quite a stir.
8502000	8507000	There was a guy with a boombox in front of him, playing one of the jingles from the Kool-Aid commercial.
8508000	8513000	It was almost like the Red Sea party wherever he went, because everyone just got out of the way and started taking pictures.
8514000	8518000	That's pretty awesome, though. But what the hell does the Kool-Aid Man have to do with Otamakons?
8519000	8521000	You see the most random stuff, but it's awesome.
8521000	8524000	Three people were thirsty. They needed Kool-Aid.
8525000	8526000	Alright, take care, RobD.
8527000	8528000	See you later.
8529000	8531000	Hey, hey, hey!
8532000	8534000	Actually, that was fat Albert, but, you know, same thing.
8535000	8536000	Alright, we'll take one more call.
8537000	8538000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8539000	8540000	Hello?
8541000	8542000	Hi, who's this?
8543000	8544000	Hey, it's Ryama.
8545000	8547000	Hey, you're very, very quiet. Can you get a little closer to your mic?
8548000	8549000	Yeah, how's this?
8549000	8550000	Hello?
8551000	8552000	Any better? Hello?
8553000	8556000	We can barely hear you. Get out your question and we'll try to answer it.
8557000	8562000	Uh, no, I just wanted to say hi. I don't know where my mic is.
8563000	8570000	Um, I just wanted, I haven't listened to Orange Launch Radio in forever, and I figured tonight I'd listen.
8570000	8578000	So, hi, um, I don't really have a question. I just want to say I'm getting raped at Dr. Mario, and it's making me feel really bad about myself.
8581000	8584000	Alright, well thank you for the call, and good luck finding the microphone.
8585000	8587000	I'm hearing too much feedback on that call.
8588000	8593000	I think he said something about getting raped at Dr. Mario? I don't know, maybe I misheard that, I don't know.
8594000	8596000	Anyway, well thanks for listening, and especially Mr. Hiyus.
8597000	8598000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8598000	8608000	Hello, Orange Launch Radio Land. It is a long-time listener, disappearing for a long time, reappearing for a short time, and, uh, lather, rinse, repeat.
8609000	8610000	Yeah, where the hell have you been?
8611000	8618000	Uh, busy. Life Sundays are not the most free for me anymore for a number of reasons, and that's about to start over, eh, excuse me, start over again.
8619000	8621000	Yeah, I'm sorry, I should have had you introduce yourself for those that don't know your voice.
8622000	8626000	Hi, I'm Jason. I'm a cool guy. I'm technically part of Orange Launch Radio 2.
8626000	8631000	You are, you are. So I'm just looking at the awesome Pyramid Head cosplay that Rob D. is sharing with us.
8632000	8635000	Alright, so what's on your mind? So you've been busy, but what provokes the call tonight?
8636000	8642000	Um, I think that Konami should not make any more music games for America.
8643000	8646000	You think that's it? They've used up all their chances.
8646000	8655000	It's, it's not even that. I love Rock Band. I absolutely do. That game is absolutely amazing, and it is way more than Guitar Freaks' Drummania ever were.
8656000	8666000	I loved Drummania. I loved Guitar Freaks. There's an arcade here that has the both of them. The Guitar Freaks is first mix, so I don't really play it, but the Drummania is V, and I go back and play it.
8666000	8678000	It had good music. I liked it. It was a fun game, but for Americans, for sales, and the ability to persist and survive in this market, this market ain't gonna happen.
8679000	8687000	Well, you say they shouldn't make any more music games, but what about, you know, DDR, which, you know, has, you know, we covered that earlier. There's always those games coming out.
8688000	8694000	Okay, minus that one, because that one actually got popular somehow. Without, I guess it's the fact that so many other songs are English.
8694000	8701000	It's so frustrating, though, because, you know, games like Beatmania had so much potential, and it's just, to see a whimper out is just very sad.
8702000	8709000	You remember all the, uh, yay, tongue-tied, woo-hoo! Do you remember all the hoops we had to jump through to get 7 style?
8710000	8712000	And now look how big 2DX is for consoles in Japan again.
8713000	8717000	Yeah, I remember. I wish I, I, which back then, I was highly critical of that whole thing, and I thought it was stupid.
8717000	8723000	Yes, I absolutely remember this. Years ago. It was one of the first things we talked about on the show, probably, at least, probably within the first year of OLR.
8724000	8731000	And for those that weren't around, you know, six years ago, basically what Konami was doing is they, they, everybody had to sign a petition or something?
8732000	8737000	A hundred and thousand, it was either a hundred thousand or two thousand, two hundred thousand signatures, and then a hundred thousand pre-orders.
8738000	8742000	Oh my, yeah, and then, like, if they didn't get so many pre-orders on the official website, they weren't gonna make the game.
8742000	8751000	It was so dumb, like, you know, just, it was so, like, the way they were just teasing us, and well, I guess it worked, you know, the game eventually came out.
8752000	8754000	And it's been doing very good ever since, at least in Japan, of course.
8755000	8759000	So is that what they need to do here? If they're gonna release another BeatMania game here, force ten thousand people to pre-order?
8760000	8768000	No, it's not gonna happen. People, it's, it's too weird, and the DJ culture is, while there are, of course, a lot of DJs, music performers and whatnot,
8768000	8777000	it just doesn't have the same, I don't even know what the word is that I'm looking for, it's not American in the sense that it's not gonna take off like that.
8778000	8788000	I mean, rock band is traditional, that is, in that genre of music, that is what, you know, American is all about, live performance, I am completely and totally screwing this up.
8788000	8798000	Sorry, no, no, no, would you say that Konami's biggest problem, outside of the DDR series, because that's successful, but Konami's biggest problem in launching these other series is that they have no idea how to choose songs?
8799000	8806000	That's part of it, and just the manner of playing the games, how the games are played is just too different.
8806000	8820000	I mean, pop and music and 2DX are very out there, even people who would understand what the concept of a DJ is, is not gonna pick up on 2DX immediately, and you know us, and if I can't do it now, I'm not gonna do it.
8821000	8831000	By us, I mean, you know, typical people who, ADHD, run through arcades, play something and then never again, unless it actually, you know, gave them something special or something along those lines.
8831000	8835000	So why Rock Revolution? Why did Konami do this?
8836000	8846000	Because Konami is in America, because Konami is supposed to be the name, game, and face of music games, and because they have to exert their fantabulousness and it's not gonna work.
8847000	8849000	It's a stripped down Guitar Freaks.
8850000	8859000	Why do this, though, why embarrass themselves with this game when they could explore a new idea in the music game world? Why go through this embarrassment?
8859000	8868000	Because they tried new in America, and it didn't work. That was Beatmania. They're trying new in America, that's beat and groovy, it's not gonna work.
8869000	8878000	So they're trying what was popular, Rockband, Guitar Hero, let's bring a guitar game, but the unfortunate thing is, it's not gonna work, comparatively speaking, of course.
8879000	8883000	What about what Bobby's saying in chat right now, they're only doing it for the patent lawsuit against MTV?
8883000	8894000	A lot of people say that's the only reason why Supernova came out. I'm half tempted to believe them just because Supernova, the interface and all things associated, was done pretty horribly by comparison.
8895000	8902000	I said this three years ago until I was blue in the face and I say it again now, the reason why In the Groove got smacked down is because they dared to enter the home console.
8903000	8907000	If they had never done that, we'd still have In the Groove arcade machines today. Mark my words?
8907000	8914000	Mark my words. If they had just kept it in their pants and not tried to invade the home market, this would have never happened.
8915000	8921000	I'd like to mark your words, but I don't have a time machine, I'm sorry. We are not brave, we cannot hold the button and go backwards.
8922000	8925000	Fair enough. Alright, Jason, we gotta go soon and wrap up the show, any final thoughts?
8926000	8928000	No, don't leave me, no.
8929000	8930000	We have to, we'll be back.
8931000	8932000	Okay, alright, see you later, Jason.
8932000	8936000	Alright, guys. Alright, we always like hearing from the long time money fans.
8937000	8942000	Sorry for those who didn't get through tonight, but we gotta get out of here, wrap things up, but not before we get some last minute stories.
8943000	8944000	Narsak, have you got anything for us tonight?
8945000	8946000	No, I do not.
8947000	8948000	What? Who and blah?
8949000	8950000	Oh, yeah, actually the Ferret does.
8952000	8953000	Lowkey, do you have any last minute stories tonight?
8954000	8955000	Yeah, yeah, time.
8956000	8957000	I got time.
8958000	8959000	Make it quick, I'll try to.
8959000	8962000	Anyway, let's get started here.
8963000	8973000	Apparently, Sony thinks that the Mirror's Edge will be exclusive to them for some time bearing.
8974000	8984000	It says, according to Reeves, Mirror's Edge will initially be exclusive to the PS3 this year, and the PC and Xbox 360 versions will be following much later.
8984000	8994000	Thankfully, they're wrong, so EA has come out and said, no, that's not true, and why they're spreading those kinds of rumors, they will never know.
8995000	9000000	Mega Man Star Force 3 got announced at, apparently, the Mega Man festival that was going on.
9001000	9012000	Yes, there was a Mega Man festival going on, and it'll be coming out in two different flavors, Black Ace and Red Joker, going for the card theme there.
9012000	9028000	Conduit is supposed to be shown at PAX, and they're going to be shown off at Nintendo's booth, which is kind of interesting, making you wonder, possibly, could Nintendo be publishing that game?
9029000	9030000	That would make sense.
9031000	9040000	I would hope that they would do that, but who knows, because right now they're saying that they still don't have a publisher, but that could be an announcement, you never know.
9040000	9042000	Let's see here.
9043000	9055000	Apparently, someone has finally hacked the PS3 to run backups. They're almost ready to release the exploit, I should say.
9055000	9071000	It's being done kind of strangely. You have to have two hard drives for the PS3, and it will allow you to run games, any game, as long as you have a Playstation 3 game in the disk drive.
9071000	9084000	I'm not sure how that's going to work, but they do have a video showing it being done, and I don't know, it's kind of weird.
9085000	9097000	Finally, let's see here, a couple other things. The Last Guy is coming out on August 28th on the Playstation Network, so that should be pretty cool, it's only about $10.
9097000	9114000	And Disaster Day in Crisis may actually be coming out eventually. Apparently, the Australian version of the ESRB has raided the game, so maybe it's not disappeared after all. That's kind of cool.
9114000	9132000	Also, not to be outdone by the iPets, Nintendo is going to be getting Monkey Madness on the Wii, which is a monkey pet sim, so you can play with your monkey. Hooray.
9132000	9147000	Konami showed off a new game at Leipzig. It's not scheduled to come out until 2010. It is a game called Lords of Shadow, and kind of looks a little bit like a next-gen Castlevania.
9148000	9156000	Because it has the main character Gabriel, who sort of looks like he could be a Belmont, fighting off some sort of monster with a flaming chain whip.
9156000	9168000	And if that doesn't scream Castlevania, I don't know what will. And those bastards in the UK have gotten Super Mario RPG on the Virtual Console, and I am angry.
9168000	9186000	But it's part of the new Hanabi Festival, which they will be getting a bunch of Japanese-only games. Hopefully that will be coming over here as well. The other thing they're going to be getting is the real Mario 2, or Mario The Lost Levels, as it was called over here.
9186000	9197000	Harmonix is teasing their next music game. They haven't really said what it is, but it... I talked about this at the end of part A. Oh, never mind. Never mind.
9198000	9211000	Fable 2, the pub games. There was an exploit in there where you can cheat and get lots of gold. Well, they're going to be fixing that, so if you want to still cheat, you'll just have to play it offline, so it doesn't patch.
9211000	9221000	I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet by downloading it. Apparently Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be having some interesting modes for the Wii.
9222000	9228000	You're going to be able to put your Miis in there and play Mii Freestyle, which is kind of like Wii Music a little bit.
9229000	9234000	That's kind of interesting because Guitar Hero World Tour will actually be coming out before Wii Music does.
9234000	9247000	Speaking of music games, Bobby is quick to point out that we are neglecting that Moving Pictures is coming to Rock Band this Tuesday. That would be a Rush album, for those that don't know. That's going to be their big download content this week.
9247000	9265000	Grand Theft Auto IV for the PC is going to be getting a replay editor and also higher resolutions and enhanced multiplayer, so that's kind of cool. That's going to be coming out in November. Rock the Vote is going to be canvassing Xbox Live. That's kind of dumb.
9265000	9288000	Alone in the Dark, the PS3 version which is coming out in November, is going to be getting a whole bunch of patches to fix all the problems in the game. Well thankfully, if you bought a version of the Xbox 360 version of Alone in the Dark, you will also be getting those same patches that will be coming with a downloadable patch, probably around the time of the PS3 game.
9288000	9295000	So, if you have the game that long, well then, it will be fixed.
9295000	9318000	We talked a little bit about PS3 SKUs and stuff like that. There are some new announced SKUs for the UK, including a 160GB PlayStation 3 SKU with Uncharted and Pain and DualShock 3 for $4.99. That is going to be replacing the 80GB system that's currently available right now with Metal Gear Solid 4.
9318000	9333000	And finally, the last thing, Red Alert 3. They announced the cast for the game, and I gotta say it's got a lot of pretty awesome people in there.
9333000	9350000	Everybody from Jenny McCarthy, to Tim Curry, to Kelly Hugh, to George Takei, and just a whole bunch of people. So, it will be really funny.
9351000	9354000	Alright, that's it for Last Minute Stories.
9354000	9369000	One last one. I thought this was interesting. Apparently, someone found a glitch in Tiger Woods 08 that would allow Tiger Woods to basically walk on water and hit a ball on top of a lake.
9370000	9381000	Well, in response to that, EA decided to put out a viral video of Tiger Woods walking on water and hitting a golf ball off the water. Because apparently, he's Jesus.
9381000	9384000	Okay.
9385000	9392000	Completely off topic, Rob, for Christmas. I want a Bluetooth LED keyboard.
9393000	9396000	Good luck with that. And I want a pony.
9397000	9398000	I need a pony.
9399000	9405000	Alright, we're going to wrap up the show. It's time for us to get out of here. But not before we get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought.
9405000	9410000	My final thought is PAX.
9411000	9415000	My final thought is PIE. Dark Sakura.
