0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Roto.
14000	19000	Tonight, August 10th, 2008, Ozzy Osbourne gets ready to rock Guitar Hero,
19000	27000	Sega admits to sonic errors, and Grand Theft Auto 4 PC is announced to no one's surprise.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	39000	We are that video game independent podcast on the internet,
39000	44000	dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'm one of the three hosts here on Orange Lounge Radio.
48000	54000	The other co-hosts, with me as always, say hello to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Yo.
55000	56000	How you doing, Jamie Summers?
56000	57000	A little warm.
57000	59000	Yeah, this is a little warm in studio tonight.
59000	62000	Not terrible, thank god, compared to weeks past.
62000	64000	I'm having geek issues.
64000	66000	Geek issues?
66000	68000	Geek drama? What type of geek drama?
68000	75000	Well, no, I'm just trying to figure out, essentially, how to move over my ringtones and stuff from my laptop,
75000	83000	iTunes, to my PC, so that I can start syncing my iPhone from my PC.
83000	86000	Oh, I thought, before the show, you were talking this whole thing about Linux.
86000	88000	I thought your geek issues had to do with Linux, not the phone.
88000	96000	Well, it does. It does, because I've decided that instead of using my PC, putting another drive on my PC,
96000	99000	I'm going to reformat my laptop to Linux Mint.
99000	100000	Nice.
100000	104000	So that I can play with it and not have to worry about the Franken-VIO going, ugh.
104000	106000	Is it minty fresh?
106000	107000	You saw it.
107000	109000	Yeah, it looks, it looks fresh.
109000	111000	It's pretty and useful.
111000	114000	Remember when fresh was a word used to describe cool things?
114000	116000	That's fresh.
116000	119000	Or crescent fresh? Any Ciffol and Ollie fans in the house?
119000	122000	Hey, the one and only tech master, Loki. How you doing, Loki?
122000	123000	I'm doing fine.
123000	125000	Are you feeling fresh?
125000	128000	I was fresh until this fucking pizza dripped on me.
128000	129000	So now you're not so fresh?
129000	134000	No. See, this is, I think it's the curse for having white shorts.
134000	136000	Ah, it's inevitable.
136000	139000	It's because, it's like, it's a magnet for shit.
139000	141000	Seriously, it's just like, everything's fine.
141000	147000	All of a sudden, like, a rogue drop of something will hit, you know, the shorts and...
147000	148000	That's all downhill for us.
148000	149000	Well, it's a good thing we don't have a webcam.
149000	152000	Oh wait, we do, over at JustinTV slash Orange Lounge Radio.
152000	158000	But the good news is, Loki's pants are obscured by the laptop of his and the, so you can't see anything.
158000	161000	It's too dark in here tonight because we have the lights off for the heat, so...
161000	162000	It's just a drop.
162000	164000	I mean, it's just a drop.
164000	172000	It's like, oh, pizza all over me, I'm so stupid, I can't eat.
172000	176000	We'll also present our always present fourth guest on the show, you, in our chat room,
176000	179000	when you join us live on All Games Radio at AllGames.com,
179000	183000	when we tape Sunday nights right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific.
183000	187000	Although, as of late, Bobby's been running over, eating up our time slot a little bit.
187000	190000	No, we forgive him, because he always has us on at the end of the show anyway.
190000	194000	So, you can always check that out on All Games Radio, live on Sunday nights.
194000	201000	And SSJ100Matt is quoting from Ciffololli, calls, calls, calls, calls from the public, calls.
201000	206000	Anyway, we always love having our chat room on board and the regulars,
206000	209000	and always some new faces, so please feel free to stop by our chat room,
209000	215000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com, while we are taking live calls and during chat hours
215000	219000	when we're taping live on Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific.
219000	221000	All right, let's start off the show as we always do.
221000	225000	How is your gaming week, the types of games you have or haven't been playing this week?
225000	229000	Maybe if you haven't been playing any games, then what you wish you were playing, dark soccer.
229000	234000	I actually really didn't, because I had the most craptastic week ever,
234000	237000	and I had a final, but now that I'm done with school.
237000	239000	I found out, though, that I don't have to report for jury duty,
239000	242000	so I won't be able to play my Game Boy when I'm supposed to be at work.
242000	244000	No Phoenix Wright for reals?
244000	247000	I really wanted to get on a trial. I really wanted to get on a trial.
247000	250000	It is fascinating stuff. Everybody should do it at least once in their life.
250000	257000	I want to be civic-dutied. Anyway, however, I do actually,
257000	260000	I did sit down and start playing Oh And On a little bit more,
260000	265000	and I'm still playing Aurora Faint on my iPhone, which is craptastic.
265000	270000	That game is fun. And Sudoku. And Ragnarok.
270000	272000	Rag to crack.
272000	275000	I noticed that when you were showing me the Linux Mint,
275000	277000	I think you seemed to be very excited, because there was a picture of it
277000	281000	flipping between two windows, both of which had Ragnarok on them.
281000	285000	Part of the deciding factor for me having a Linux boot
285000	287000	is if I can play Ragnarok on line item or not.
287000	290000	So is that so you can run your storefront in one window,
290000	292000	and so you can quest in the other? Is that what it is?
292000	295000	Well, no, because I play on private servers. All I have to do is auto trade.
295000	296000	Oh, I see.
296000	298000	And it'll vend while I am gone.
298000	304000	But no, it's just so that I really want something that runs a lot,
304000	306000	well, it runs a lot more efficiently.
306000	309000	I just need to make sure that my system is going to be okay with it
309000	311000	for me to make the switch.
311000	314000	And right now I have to figure out, because I've tried doing this before,
314000	318000	trying to get my iTunes, my ringtones and contacts and everything
318000	322000	to sync on my newer computer.
322000	324000	And so far iTunes said, ah, fuck it.
324000	329000	So as soon as I get that to work, I can reinstall on my laptop
329000	330000	and see how that goes.
330000	334000	Well, I am considering upgrading the computer here in studio, actually.
334000	338000	I'm going to talk more about next week's plan in just a minute,
338000	341000	but since it's likely we're not going to be here with the show next week,
341000	343000	I'm thinking about taking the time to upgrade the computer here in studio
343000	347000	because I have my eyes on some quad core systems and some fancy stuff.
347000	351000	Well, you can tell it's old because it's that off-white color
351000	353000	because all the computers nowadays are black.
353000	354000	Yeah, they're black now.
354000	355000	Black is the new off-white.
355000	356000	Exactly.
356000	360000	You can.
360000	361000	Anything else?
361000	364000	It also doesn't have a window and excessive lights in it.
364000	366000	Anything else you want to share about your gaming week, DarkSagra?
366000	370000	My annoyments with my husband because he still hasn't got me
370000	374000	to The World Ends With You, and he was supposed to, and he didn't.
374000	376000	Liar.
376000	381000	I have it with me if you wish to play it during the break.
381000	383000	Okay.
383000	386000	There was a whole lot of GTA-ing going on in the house.
386000	388000	But you still won all to yourself.
388000	389000	The World Ends With You for you.
389000	390000	Yes, I do. For me.
390000	391000	For you.
391000	392000	To have.
392000	393000	Comments in chat.
393000	395000	DreadLockLord says, Sky, get an Alienware,
395000	398000	and SGA100Matt says, Alienware is overpriced.
398000	399000	Just build one from scratch.
399000	400000	Exactly.
400000	401000	I'm thinking of doing the scratch thing,
401000	404000	but damn, there are some good deals in those package systems.
404000	406000	It is so tempting.
406000	407000	What?
407000	408000	Newegg.
408000	409000	I'm thinking about it.
409000	410000	It's not.
410000	411000	I am actually, oh, God, I hate to.
411000	415000	I'm gonna get so many nerdy emails from nerds everywhere that say I'm stupid,
415000	417000	but I'm actually, I have my eye on a gateway.
417000	421000	It's really cheap, and it's really good.
421000	423000	I only bought a gateway.
423000	427000	Listen, I know this is radio, but I just got the look of shame, like, twice.
427000	430000	Listen, I have a gateway laptop.
430000	433000	That's because you can't build a laptop from scratch.
433000	435000	And trust me, I looked.
435000	438000	I was going to build one from scratch, even if it's the ugliest piece of shit thing ever.
438000	440000	As long as I built it from scratch.
440000	443000	But no, I got this because it was an open box, and it was just,
443000	445000	Bryce was right at the time, so.
445000	451000	Actually, I have a, one of my friends does a little bit of laptop tweaking
451000	456000	and can build a Mac as long as it has the right hardware in it.
456000	457000	I got my iBook.
457000	459000	That's enough Mac for me, for the house.
459000	462000	I'm actually, as soon as I get money set aside for it,
462000	466000	I'm having him help me with building a Mac from scratch.
466000	467000	What kind of hardware is required?
467000	469000	A heating element for toast?
469000	475000	You know what, I want a Mac because I deal with artsy stuff all the time,
475000	477000	and I need it, so, shut up.
477000	480000	And I'll tell you what, having edited movies on PC and Mac now,
480000	481000	it's so much easier on the Mac.
481000	483000	It is so much easier to edit movies on the Mac.
483000	484000	Anyhow, look.
484000	487000	Not every computer is meant for games, duh.
487000	489000	Back to games for a minute.
489000	491000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
491000	492000	My gaming week was alright.
492000	493000	I didn't play too much.
493000	494000	Had my eye on.
494000	497000	I was trying to catch up with stuff that I meant to play.
497000	500000	This week I did check out Braid because I was like,
500000	502000	hmm, I haven't made a random purchase online yet.
502000	503000	Random!
503000	504000	There you go.
504000	505000	Buy that.
505000	507000	So I bought it.
507000	510000	I think, you know, because the big thing right now is that
510000	512000	$15 isn't worth it.
512000	515000	I think everyone's kind of not really concerned whether this game's worth $15,
515000	519000	but when these games that are $15 start selling,
519000	522000	Microsoft goes, oh, so they'll pay $15.
522000	526000	Okay, we're going to make all of them $15, and now $20.
526000	528000	Oh, they'll pay $20.
528000	530000	We'll make them all $20, and now $25.
530000	531000	It's like the price of gasoline.
531000	533000	I was just saying something about this the other day.
533000	535000	You know how gas prices have been coming down lately,
535000	537000	and it's about, what, $3.90 a gallon locally now?
537000	541000	And everybody's going, hooray, gas is under $4 a gallon, hooray.
541000	543000	And I'm like, that's what they want you to think.
543000	545000	They want you to think you're getting a good deal,
545000	548000	but you've got to remember a year ago it was $2.90,
548000	550000	and even that was high.
550000	552000	So don't buy into that.
552000	554000	Exactly, and that's what's going on with this,
554000	556000	is I think the gamers are trying to tell Microsoft,
556000	559000	hey, listen, we're going to buy this game,
559000	561000	but we don't expect all these games to be $15,
561000	563000	and we're not going to fucking buy all of them.
563000	565000	And all that being said, I think Braid is worth $15.
565000	566000	Absolutely.
566000	569000	I would say it's worth $10, but that's about it.
569000	572000	And the only reason, because it's quick.
572000	575000	I mean, I know you said you had a little bit of problems with it.
575000	577000	Because I'm stupid, and it takes me a long time
577000	578000	to figure out these puzzles.
578000	579000	I'm almost all the way through the game,
579000	581000	and it's only been about two hours,
581000	584000	and it's just, I mean, there's some of the puzzles
584000	585000	later on are a little bit tricky,
585000	588000	but the first few ones I kind of figured out
588000	590000	what they want me to do really quick.
590000	592000	And I kind of look back at this and like,
592000	594000	okay, there's going to be speed runs you can do
594000	599000	throughout the game, but that's really the only replayability.
599000	602000	Quickly though, because I knew nothing about Braid,
602000	604000	absolutely zilch about this game.
604000	606000	I think I might have heard it mentioned
606000	608000	like out of a game developer's conference once or twice,
608000	610000	but about the game itself, I knew nothing about it
610000	613000	except that it was supposedly this really critically acclaimed game
613000	615000	until I got my hands on it this week.
615000	617000	So for those of our listeners who have no Xbox 360,
617000	619000	what is this game all about?
619000	621000	I want to hear the low-key version of this.
621000	624000	It's about this dude who's going around
624000	628000	and being all emo about the fact that he lost somebody
628000	629000	and he's like searching for something.
629000	631000	To be honest, it's like, text, text, text,
631000	633000	I'm walking past it all, you know.
633000	636000	But, yeah, thank God he can bypass the story.
636000	642000	I read it, okay, but I was just like,
642000	647000	okay, my whole thing is there's one of them
647000	649000	that sounds like he had a wife or something
649000	651000	but now he's going after some other chick
651000	656000	and he left her to go find this old flame or princess or whatever,
656000	658000	and I'm thinking, you're just going to realize
658000	661000	that you lost your wife because you're an idiot.
661000	665000	But then at the same time, this guy is some crazy dude
665000	668000	that's got a tie in walking through this world
668000	671000	that's a rip-off of Super Mario Brothers, you know.
671000	674000	But the game is nothing like Super Mario Brothers.
674000	675000	That's the thing, though, I know.
675000	679000	But at the same time, it is, I don't know,
679000	682000	it's got really cool, unique gameplay elements to it.
682000	685000	You know, Portal could take notice of this,
685000	688000	and maybe this would be perfect for, you know, Portal 2.
688000	691000	But, I don't know.
691000	693000	There are some things, though, that I did read
693000	696000	that there's eight hidden stars in the game,
696000	699000	which may unlock some more stuff later,
699000	701000	which would be kind of cool.
701000	704000	But there's just, once you're done with the game,
704000	706000	I don't see it really going, I guess it's like Portal a little bit,
706000	708000	you know, you don't really go back.
708000	710000	But they built the speedrun thing into it,
710000	712000	the speedrun contest, which I thought was kind of interesting.
712000	714000	Like, once you beat it once, you can go through and do the speedruns,
714000	716000	but I'm too stupid to beat it even once.
716000	719000	I mean, this game makes you feel like a dummy.
719000	721000	At least, if you're me.
721000	724000	But there's a certain factor when you're playing through the game, at least.
724000	726000	I don't know about you, but there were certain puzzles
726000	728000	that were frustrating the hell out of me.
728000	730000	Like, I was getting in that whole, like, old school,
730000	732000	like, I'm gonna throw the Nintendo controller at the screen mode.
732000	734000	But when I solved it, I was like,
734000	737000	yes, I'm awesome, I solved the puzzle, you know what I mean?
737000	740000	Like, there was definitely some rewards to it.
740000	743000	I've actually not used any online game facts
743000	745000	or anything like that to get through the game.
745000	747000	I've just been playing it normal and just trying to figure out.
747000	749000	You're smart! You got more pieces than I do.
749000	752000	Well, you know, I'm also trying to be a completist,
752000	754000	so I won't continue on until,
754000	756000	unless that last level, because I got pissed off with it,
756000	757000	so I just ran all the way through it.
757000	759000	Yeah, I just ran all the way through all the levels once,
759000	762000	and then I went back and tried to beat them.
762000	765000	But, you know, I don't know.
765000	767000	It would be cooler if it was longer.
767000	770000	Hopefully they'll have some download stuff later,
770000	772000	because that would be pretty cool for it.
772000	774000	Anyways, enough with Braid.
774000	778000	I also played this week the demo for Battle Fantasia,
778000	783000	which is like this weird medieval anime fighting game type thing.
783000	785000	It was okay. I don't know.
785000	787000	I've heard about that game. What do you think of it?
787000	791000	It's pretty. I mean, it's all 3D and stuff.
791000	793000	But it was alright.
793000	795000	They have two characters you can play as.
795000	797000	One has this chainsaw thing,
797000	800000	and the other guy is this little kid in knight's armor,
800000	801000	and he's fighting and stuff.
801000	803000	It's alright. I'm not really in the fighting game,
803000	806000	so it was just okay for me.
806000	808000	But, you know, it's pretty.
808000	810000	It looks a lot better than I thought it would.
810000	813000	If you're looking for another game to pick up,
813000	816000	other than maybe Soul Calibur IV or something like that,
816000	818000	this you might like.
818000	820000	Check it out.
820000	822000	Then Grand Theft Auto IV.
822000	825000	I also got my 360 back from Microsoft being repaired.
825000	829000	It was actually really quick, which I was surprised.
829000	831000	So that went pretty well.
831000	833000	I kept the old box just in case another one dies,
833000	836000	so for a track record it's been like 5 out of 6,
836000	839000	or 7 if you include the new one I bought.
839000	843000	So, yeah, that's about it.
843000	848000	I'm definitely looking forward to this week for Bionaut Commando.
848000	849000	Oh, is that this week?
849000	850000	That's this week.
850000	852000	Oh, that should be fun.
852000	855000	Xbox did a good thing with this whole Xbox Live Arcade for August,
855000	858000	because between Geometry Wars 2 last week,
858000	860000	which I'm still playing,
860000	863000	and Braid this week, I'm busy.
863000	865000	I've barely been touching Soul Calibur.
865000	867000	I think the only time I played Soul Calibur at all this week
867000	870000	was when one of the listeners wanted to do some fighting,
870000	871000	which I did.
871000	873000	Yeah, I didn't get to play a lot this week,
873000	874000	because I was actually...
874000	875000	I'm sorry, I felt bad,
875000	877000	because another listener wanted to battle me,
877000	878000	and I was too into Braid.
878000	881000	I just ignored all the messages that were popping up,
881000	882000	and I'm like, oh, I should go look at them.
882000	884000	Oh, the poor guy wants to play Soul Calibur,
884000	885000	and here I am all sucked into Braid.
885000	888000	I don't know, this week I didn't get to play a lot,
888000	890000	because I was doing some video editing
890000	893000	for something I'm making for work,
893000	896000	and I also didn't get to work on the PSP website at all,
896000	899000	but it's coming along, I promise.
899000	902000	I'm just working on a bunch of small stuff, unfortunately,
902000	906000	and then maybe I'll try to finish the bigger stuff first.
906000	907000	I don't know.
907000	908000	That's it.
908000	910000	I've been looking a lot at Singets Row 2, though.
910000	912000	I mean, the more stuff I see for it, the cooler it looks,
912000	915000	and I'm really excited to play that game.
915000	916000	All right.
916000	917000	My Gaming Week, as I already mentioned,
917000	919000	Braid, I think Braid is absolutely worth it.
919000	921000	I'm sure $15 is fine.
921000	924000	I want to refrain from trying to use the Penny Arcade argument
924000	926000	that they posted earlier this week about the whole,
926000	928000	well, you'll spend $15 on a shirt,
928000	929000	so why not spend $15 on a game?
929000	931000	I'm taking a different approach,
931000	933000	and if you were listening to Bobby's show a minute ago,
933000	934000	I'm going to use the same thing,
934000	936000	so I apologize to our listeners live who were hearing it twice,
936000	938000	but, you know, I went and saw The Dark Knight,
938000	940000	and I paid $10 to see The Dark Knight,
940000	942000	because movie prices are insane right now,
942000	944000	and that's not even counting the price of an IC
944000	945000	and candy and all that shit,
945000	947000	so I paid $10 to see The Dark Knight,
947000	949000	which entertained me for two and a half hours,
949000	951000	and Braid's already entertained me that long,
951000	953000	you know, just through the little bit I've played of it.
953000	956000	I know people that have gone to see The Dark Knight three times,
956000	960000	meaning they've paid $30 to see the same two and a half hours.
960000	961000	Don't get me wrong.
961000	963000	I'm not bashing The Dark Knight, great movie,
963000	965000	but why is it okay to spend $30 there,
965000	968000	but yet $15 feels like such a ripoff?
968000	970000	Because it's apples and oranges.
970000	971000	I get what you're saying.
971000	973000	I completely understand what you're saying about the whole,
973000	974000	you don't want to set a precedent for Microsoft,
974000	976000	because especially the fact that, okay,
976000	979000	then there's games like Fusion Frenzy 2 that cost, what, $50,
979000	981000	that entertained me for 30 seconds,
981000	984000	the amount of time for the logo to get on and off the screen.
984000	985000	It's a retarded argument.
985000	987000	I understand what Penny Arcade was trying to say,
987000	989000	but it's fucking a retarded argument.
989000	990000	Oh, snap, all right.
990000	991000	Oh, well, let's go to Disneyland,
991000	992000	because you can spend a day there that's, you know,
992000	994000	about eight hours, and you spend $100,
994000	996000	so let's charge $100 for every fucking online game,
996000	998000	because it's, you know, over eight hours of entertainment.
998000	999000	That's retarded.
999000	1001000	However, however, however,
1001000	1005000	I can absolutely disprove that there's any validity to that argument,
1005000	1009000	because going to Disneyland is like paying for 30 MMOs.
1009000	1011000	Yeah, and going to Disneyland has Space Mountain.
1011000	1012000	End of story.
1012000	1013000	End of argument.
1013000	1015000	And California Screamin'.
1015000	1018000	All right, fine, you pay $50 for, you know, console games.
1018000	1020000	Why can't you pay $50 for this online game?
1020000	1023000	I know it's only, you know, six hours long or eight hours long,
1023000	1025000	but some console games, because they suck,
1025000	1027000	are only eight hours long as well.
1027000	1029000	And some, and to be honest,
1029000	1031000	this may actually have a little bit more polish
1031000	1032000	than some of the stuff that ends up on the Wii.
1032000	1033000	For real.
1033000	1034000	That's what I'm saying.
1034000	1036000	That's why I'm like, $15 is not a bad price,
1036000	1038000	but I do agree, we don't want to set a precedent,
1038000	1041000	but I think those games that are $15 that are crap
1041000	1042000	are not going to sell.
1042000	1044000	Like, look at some of the, like that Sudoku game,
1044000	1046000	and the, no, no, the Crosswords game.
1046000	1048000	Wasn't that like 10 bucks?
1048000	1051000	Has anybody, a quick, quick poll in chat, folks,
1051000	1052000	chat.ownerslonsradio.com,
1052000	1054000	did anyone drop 10 bucks on that Crossword game?
1054000	1055000	That's what I want to know.
1055000	1057000	Did you really need the achievement points that bad?
1057000	1058000	Don't be shy.
1058000	1060000	This is a real needy survey,
1060000	1063000	because I want to know if anyone dropped $10 on that game.
1063000	1065000	Now, because it wasn't worth it,
1065000	1066000	and it sends a message.
1066000	1069000	And I do give them props for having demos for this stuff,
1069000	1070000	which is nice.
1070000	1072000	That's what they really need to do,
1072000	1074000	because there's some companies, Nintendo,
1074000	1077000	that don't put demos for their games up there,
1077000	1079000	and so you buy it, and you're like,
1079000	1081000	wow, this sucks.
1081000	1082000	Can I get my money back?
1082000	1083000	No?
1083000	1084000	Oh, well, fuck you.
1084000	1087000	I'm not buying anymore.
1087000	1089000	I don't know, it's just,
1089000	1091000	unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about it,
1091000	1093000	because games like this are going to sell well,
1093000	1094000	and they're going to say,
1094000	1096000	hey, people are going to be willing to pay this kind of money,
1096000	1097000	so let's raise the price.
1097000	1100000	Oh, well, we'll just use the excuse that my game's,
1100000	1102000	you know, small, and I'm an independent publisher,
1102000	1104000	and if you don't buy my game at $15,
1104000	1106000	I don't make any money.
1106000	1108000	Or, you know, oh, you know,
1108000	1110000	development costs are going up more,
1110000	1114000	and oh, we need more money for this stuff.
1114000	1117000	Dude, I mean, development costs for a game,
1117000	1119000	no offense, the art style's awesome,
1119000	1120000	the engine's pretty cool, you know,
1120000	1122000	I'm sure that took some time,
1122000	1125000	but seriously, there's like,
1125000	1127000	they're goombas, okay?
1127000	1128000	They're piranha plants.
1128000	1129000	There's so much more to it than that.
1129000	1131000	All right, look, we're just going to have to disagree.
1131000	1133000	That happens sometimes when you have three people on a show.
1133000	1135000	I say it's worth it, and go spend the money right now.
1135000	1136000	Nintendo will sue.
1136000	1138000	I think it's...
1138000	1140000	Nintendo has nothing to sue over.
1140000	1144000	The game is, it's an homage to Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong
1144000	1146000	and other games.
1146000	1148000	What if, in fact, did you notice
1148000	1151000	that the Donkey Kong level was called Jumpman,
1151000	1154000	which is Mario's name in Donkey Kong?
1154000	1155000	Yeah.
1155000	1156000	There are these subtle little...
1156000	1157000	What about stories, right?
1157000	1158000	All right, sorry, look.
1158000	1159000	We have to have an argument.
1159000	1160000	I'm telling you, Dark Soccer,
1160000	1162000	you really need to check out Braid.
1162000	1163000	You really do.
1163000	1164000	I planned on it, and actually...
1164000	1165000	We need a third opinion.
1165000	1167000	I added Major Nelson to my Twitter,
1167000	1170000	and so he put up a download code up for it.
1170000	1171000	Did you get it?
1171000	1172000	No, I didn't. I was at work.
1172000	1174000	Oh, then somebody else did cry.
1174000	1175000	But I'm just saying, you know,
1175000	1177000	if anyone wants to check out some of these games,
1177000	1178000	you know, for free as they come up,
1178000	1181000	he's doing crap like this all the time on Twitter.
1181000	1182000	Just pray you're first.
1182000	1183000	Seriously.
1183000	1185000	All right, results of our quick poll in chat.
1185000	1187000	Did anyone buy the crosswords game?
1187000	1190000	No, no, nope, what, hell no, no, no.
1190000	1192000	I didn't even know there was a crossword game.
1192000	1193000	Flash games, anyone?
1193000	1196000	Nope, hell no, no, and so on.
1196000	1198000	So I didn't see anyone say yes.
1198000	1200000	Oh, just kind of throwing that out there.
1200000	1201000	All right, the rest of my gaming week,
1201000	1204000	Geometry Wars 2, WoW, Soul Calibur,
1204000	1207000	pretty much nothing else new besides Braid.
1207000	1208000	But that's okay,
1208000	1211000	because Braid was a worthwhile expenditure this week.
1211000	1213000	Okay, that's it for my gaming week.
1213000	1216000	Let's get into tonight's housekeeping.
1216000	1218000	My Vegas trip I talked about last week got canceled
1218000	1220000	due to personal reasons, nothing bad.
1220000	1222000	It's just, didn't end up being able to do it.
1222000	1224000	So, but we're still,
1224000	1226000	because some of us kind of banked on there
1226000	1227000	not being a show next week,
1227000	1229000	we may still not be here,
1229000	1233000	just especially because like a week or two before PAX,
1233000	1235000	we might just kind of take the week off anyway.
1235000	1238000	Stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com for the details.
1238000	1239000	We'll keep you guys posted
1239000	1240000	if we end up doing anything pre-taped,
1240000	1242000	which looks likely or not,
1242000	1243000	but we probably will not be live next week,
1243000	1244000	but you never know,
1244000	1246000	just stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com.
1246000	1249000	That's pretty much that as far as the show goes.
1249000	1250000	I do want to say, though,
1250000	1251000	I thought it was very cool,
1251000	1253000	even though I am not going to end up
1253000	1254000	getting to go to Vegas,
1254000	1255000	and I'm going to miss the Star Trek experience,
1255000	1257000	I did have a listener email me,
1257000	1258000	and I'm sorry, I don't have my email open,
1258000	1259000	so I forgot your name,
1259000	1261000	but he mentioned that he and his,
1261000	1263000	and I forget if it was girlfriend or wife,
1263000	1265000	I think he said wife,
1265000	1266000	or future wife or something,
1266000	1270000	said that because I mentioned it on the show,
1270000	1271000	they bumped up their trip.
1271000	1273000	They didn't realize the Star Trek experience
1273000	1274000	was closing and got to go,
1274000	1276000	so I just thought that was awesome.
1276000	1277000	That made me feel really warm and fuzzy
1277000	1279000	about the power of this show
1279000	1281000	to help out nerds everywhere.
1281000	1283000	Live long and prosper, my friend.
1283000	1284000	Have fun, you guys.
1284000	1286000	The other housekeeping thing I wanted to say,
1286000	1288000	iTunes reviews.
1288000	1290000	Please be so kind to leave us
1290000	1292000	a five-star review on iTunes.
1292000	1293000	Just search for Orange Launch Radio.
1293000	1294000	Leave us a nice review.
1294000	1295000	I'll be posting the link in chat shortly
1295000	1298000	if you guys would be so kind to post some reviews.
1298000	1300000	We would heart that very muchly.
1300000	1303000	It helps, because the more positive reviews,
1303000	1304000	it helps the ranking.
1304000	1305000	The higher the ranking,
1305000	1306000	the more likely people are to find us,
1306000	1309000	and nothing against the shows that are all top-rated,
1309000	1311000	but 80% of them are commercial,
1311000	1315000	like G4, 1UP, GameSpot-style casts
1315000	1317000	that don't need that attention.
1317000	1319000	They have TV stations and websites and magazines
1319000	1320000	that back them.
1320000	1321000	They don't need it.
1321000	1322000	You know what's also sick?
1322000	1323000	What?
1323000	1324000	Some of those websites, like IGN,
1324000	1326000	run like eight podcasts.
1326000	1327000	Dude.
1327000	1328000	And they're all in the top 20.
1328000	1329000	I know.
1329000	1330000	Seriously.
1330000	1331000	I know.
1331000	1332000	They need eight podcasts.
1332000	1333000	All right.
1333000	1334000	Anyhow.
1334000	1336000	To answer Quel Tipo,
1336000	1338000	what we endorse is free thought.
1338000	1340000	What did Quel Tipo say?
1340000	1341000	Waterboarding.
1341000	1342000	What the hell is that?
1342000	1343000	I have no idea,
1343000	1347000	but I'm just saying we endorse thinking for yourself.
1347000	1350000	Waterboarding is where you pour water over someone's face
1350000	1352000	when you're interrogating them,
1352000	1354000	and it gives them the sensation of drowning,
1354000	1356000	and apparently is some big controversy
1356000	1357000	going on in the government,
1357000	1358000	because they do that, too.
1358000	1359000	Oh, okay.
1359000	1360000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1360000	1362000	I do remember reading a politically oriented story on that now.
1362000	1365000	However, what we endorse is thinking for yourself
1365000	1368000	and acting responsibly within the confines
1368000	1370000	of your own concept of morality.
1370000	1371000	Does that work?
1371000	1372000	Mm-hmm.
1372000	1373000	Okay.
1373000	1374000	Do that.
1374000	1375000	All right.
1375000	1376000	Let's move on.
1376000	1377000	Ice Cream Man.
1377000	1378000	Give me...
1378000	1379000	Hold on.
1379000	1380000	We have to pause the show.
1380000	1381000	We hear an ice cream truck.
1381000	1382000	All right.
1382000	1383000	Loki.
1383000	1385000	Ice Cream Man does not have that kind of base.
1385000	1386000	I'm sorry.
1386000	1388000	It's the gangsta.
1388000	1389000	Ice Cream Man.
1389000	1392000	Although if I had an ice cream truck, you know...
1392000	1393000	Loki, gaming news.
1393000	1394000	Let's get to it.
1394000	1397000	If you are an attractive person looking for a cool game,
1397000	1400000	well, you'll be happy to know that tomorrow,
1400000	1402000	or Monday, August 11th,
1402000	1406000	the first episode of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People,
1406000	1409000	Homestar Ruiner, will be coming out,
1409000	1412000	and that'll be available on WiiWare and PC,
1412000	1416000	and that's exciting.
1416000	1418000	Yeah.
1418000	1420000	That is very exciting.
1420000	1421000	Sorry.
1421000	1422000	Comment and chat.
1422000	1424000	Kadosho says, yay, ice cream truck.
1424000	1426000	It has 150 hit points.
1426000	1429000	Suma says, so in other words,
1429000	1430000	OLR supports torture?
1430000	1432000	No.
1432000	1434000	We just support people thinking for themselves
1434000	1437000	and doing whatever they feel is morally and ethically correct.
1437000	1441000	Well, some of these past episodes that we've done, well...
1441000	1442000	Anyhow, Strong Bad.
1442000	1444000	You excited about the Strong Bad game?
1444000	1445000	No.
1445000	1447000	I never was one into, you know, Homestar Ruiner.
1447000	1448000	All right, then screw you.
1448000	1450000	Dark Soccer, I know you like Homestar Ruiner.
1450000	1451000	You gonna check out the game?
1451000	1453000	Hell yeah.
1453000	1455000	I'm a cool and attractive person.
1455000	1457000	Are you gonna download it on PC, Rob?
1457000	1458000	Since obviously you're...
1458000	1460000	Yes, I will check it out on PC since I'm having issues.
1460000	1461000	I'm gonna get a WiiWare.
1461000	1464000	Which is a bummer because somebody I know is...
1464000	1466000	I don't know how much I should say,
1466000	1467000	but I should be getting the Wii one,
1467000	1468000	but I'm not.
1468000	1469000	I'm gonna get the PC one.
1469000	1471000	I'm still supporting it one way or the other,
1471000	1472000	and I get to revisit.
1472000	1473000	Here's the thing.
1473000	1475000	I haven't even watched Homestar Ruiner in like two years,
1475000	1476000	so it's kind of one of those,
1476000	1478000	oh, it's revisiting an old friend.
1478000	1480000	So that's my plan.
1480000	1483000	I demand an Ask A Ninja game.
1483000	1484000	You'll never...
1484000	1485000	We'll see. We'll see.
1485000	1486000	Someday.
1486000	1487000	Alright.
1487000	1488000	So there it is.
1488000	1489000	Check that out next week.
1489000	1491000	Meanwhile, or Monday even.
1491000	1492000	You don't even have to wait a week.
1492000	1494000	Meanwhile, also on the Wii,
1494000	1496000	Rock Band 2, and apparently they are saying that
1496000	1498000	Rock Band 2 is not gonna hold back on any of the features
1498000	1500000	that you know from the other Rock Band games,
1500000	1502000	meaning like download content.
1502000	1504000	Hello, that's something the first Rock Band was sorely missing.
1504000	1506000	They had to put the bonus songs on the disc
1506000	1508000	and call it like a bonus exclusive.
1508000	1511000	Apparently, you're gonna be able to download songs,
1511000	1513000	do the whole online thing,
1513000	1516000	make your own rocker, drummer, whatever.
1516000	1518000	Apparently, this is coming from Wired magazine.
1518000	1520000	Wired is saying that the Wii version of Rock Band 2
1520000	1523000	is going to be, and this is right out of Harmonix's mouth,
1523000	1526000	fully featured DLC online play.
1526000	1528000	It's going to be a much more competitive product.
1528000	1530000	Do they know something we don't?
1530000	1531000	I know, exactly.
1531000	1533000	I'm kind of curious to see what magic little thing
1533000	1535000	is gonna be implemented between now and whenever
1535000	1536000	this game comes out.
1536000	1537000	November?
1537000	1540000	So, very interesting.
1540000	1542000	But good news for Wii owners,
1542000	1544000	especially those that want to have Rock Band,
1544000	1548000	if you didn't pony up the money for an Xbox or PlayStation 3
1548000	1549000	and this is all you got in your house,
1549000	1551000	you won't experience Rock Band,
1551000	1555000	I'm glad to hear, finally, you won't be getting held back.
1555000	1558000	No, this is not, wasn't in our show role,
1558000	1561000	but I was gonna mention it anyways,
1561000	1568000	because there was supposedly the information that
1568000	1572000	Rock Band 2's release dates got leaked, apparently.
1572000	1574000	I think we are talking about that in part B tonight.
1574000	1575000	Oh, we are?
1575000	1576000	You are, actually.
1576000	1577000	I am, yes.
1577000	1578000	I didn't see it on there.
1578000	1579000	So stay tuned.
1579000	1580000	Oh.
1580000	1581000	It's there.
1581000	1582000	Nevermind.
1582000	1583000	We'll talk about it later on.
1583000	1584000	I'm jumping ahead.
1584000	1586000	See, we have to tease them with something for later.
1586000	1588000	So, we'll just have to go, we'll have to go back in time
1588000	1590000	for now, right, Darksyra?
1590000	1591000	Well, you ready to do the time warp?
1591000	1593000	Because we've been time warping all over this story.
1593000	1596000	It's just a jump to the left.
1596000	1597000	What was it?
1597000	1599000	Remember what we saw at Margaret Cho,
1599000	1603000	talking about her mother going to see Rocky?
1603000	1604000	Games!
1604000	1605000	Darksyra Games.
1605000	1608000	Alright, well, Mega Man 9, as we know,
1608000	1610000	is going to be nest-tastic.
1610000	1614000	However, you've got an option to make it even more nest-tastic.
1614000	1616000	You can make it flicker.
1616000	1617000	That's right.
1617000	1620000	You can make it flicker as a built-in bug in the game
1620000	1623000	if you so choose to activate it.
1623000	1627000	So, for anyone who is so young that they don't know what flicker is,
1627000	1630000	this is a good way to discover what we grew up with.
1630000	1632000	This is awesome, too, because, like, you know,
1632000	1635000	companies like EA and Ubisoft and stuff like that
1635000	1638000	tend to release games that have a few glitches.
1638000	1640000	Oh, don't worry.
1640000	1643000	It was intentional for your save to get deleted.
1643000	1644000	It's retro.
1644000	1646000	You like retro.
1646000	1650000	Well, in this case, you can select if you want it on or off.
1650000	1655000	But it's also saying that there's going to be other types of glitches
1655000	1657000	that you would commonly find.
1657000	1661000	Because, you know, I found the glitch in Mega Man 3 by myself
1661000	1665000	where you can kill yourself, you jump down a hole,
1665000	1668000	and then you hold the left and right buttons
1668000	1672000	so that you do the super jump and you lose all of your life
1672000	1675000	and you can't shoot anything, but you can still use your weapons
1675000	1677000	because you're invincible.
1677000	1678000	Because you're dead.
1678000	1680000	You're undead Mega Man.
1680000	1683000	I have to say this from chat because this kind of goes along with the story.
1683000	1685000	ActDef says Mega Man 9 will have flickers and bugs.
1685000	1687000	Yay for Ness.
1687000	1690000	Why is this exciting news that we're going to have bugs in the game?
1690000	1692000	Well, granted, they're optional, but why is this exciting?
1692000	1694000	It's something that you can pick.
1694000	1698000	Because the whole purpose of the game is to have the experience
1698000	1702000	of playing one of the old 8-bit versions of a Mega Man game,
1702000	1704000	which technically that's what it is.
1704000	1706000	You can have it the way the other ones were.
1706000	1709000	You can have it the way the other ones were if you want to.
1709000	1712000	Why complain about something that you can turn on or off?
1712000	1715000	That earns you the STFU award.
1715000	1717000	Thank you very much. Drive-thru, please.
1717000	1719000	It's not really so much that, but the fact that it's like,
1719000	1721000	OMG news, you know what I mean?
1721000	1723000	I think it is newsworthy.
1723000	1725000	It's interesting. I'll give it that.
1725000	1730000	I think that it's basically everyone's excited about the attention to details like that.
1730000	1733000	I could see that. I could give it that.
1733000	1735000	I still say?
1737000	1738000	Fine.
1738000	1739000	That's what I say.
1739000	1740000	So noted.
1740000	1743000	Well, put that on the OLR Wiki, please.
1743000	1746000	The Dark Soccer's official statement on this episode is...
1748000	1751000	Well, one series that's been known for a few glitches, at least.
1751000	1757000	In fact, a glitch-themed musical number that was released on the Internet.
1757000	1758000	Saints Row.
1758000	1761000	Well, Saints Row 2 will not be coming to the Wii,
1761000	1763000	which is not surprising.
1763000	1768000	Basically, the concerns are over controversy that a game like that may cause,
1768000	1775000	and also the fact that the graphics on the Wii aren't exactly what they are on the Xbox 360.
1775000	1780000	They basically are worried that because if you had Wii controls for, like,
1780000	1784000	chainsaws and satchel charges and stuff like that in the game,
1784000	1787000	that you may risk running into an adults-only rating,
1787000	1790000	kind of like Manhunt 2 did.
1790000	1794000	But, I think that's stupid that they think that scene is,
1794000	1798000	there's been games out there that have had similar things already,
1798000	1801000	and been released mature,
1801000	1805000	and have done pretty well, like Scarface, or The Godfather,
1805000	1811000	or, I don't know, No More Heroes, or Mad World that's coming out.
1811000	1815000	So, I guess we'll just leave it to graphics.
1815000	1818000	I was gonna say, isn't this game just, I mean, controversy aside,
1818000	1821000	isn't this game just kind of too much graphically for the Wii?
1821000	1823000	Yeah.
1823000	1827000	That's it then, right? Why play the controversy card?
1827000	1831000	Wouldn't people just accept the fact that the Wii can't handle it, period?
1831000	1834000	I guess, and you know what, what they need to do is have,
1834000	1838000	it's gonna take people releasing a big name game,
1838000	1841000	like, another Grand Theft Auto that's on the Wii,
1841000	1845000	before companies decide, hey, the Wii's viable for that kind of game,
1845000	1850000	because right now, even though there has been some mature games on there,
1850000	1853000	and they're starting to get a little bit more adult content,
1853000	1857000	it's still perceived as a kid's system, just like the GameCube was,
1857000	1861000	and they're really having trouble getting past that stigmata,
1861000	1863000	and Nintendo isn't helping.
1863000	1866000	They're definitely not helping with Wii music and shit like that,
1866000	1871000	but it's just, it's really gonna take a big game like Grand Theft Auto coming out on it,
1871000	1874000	before people go, hey, we can release our game on there,
1874000	1877000	and actually make it for the Wii only.
1877000	1881000	Alright, fair enough. Well, look, one thing that is certainly exclusive to the Wii
1881000	1884000	that we haven't seen on other systems yet is waggling and motion,
1884000	1889000	and motion's about to get even better when Wii Sports Resort comes out,
1889000	1891000	and the Motion Plus accessory comes out.
1891000	1894000	Now, the Motion Plus was developed by a company called InvenSense,
1894000	1896000	that actually made this accessory.
1896000	1899000	Well, news came out this week that this Motion Plus technology,
1899000	1903000	there is no exclusive deal with Nintendo,
1903000	1908000	meaning that if InvenSense wanted to, they could take this technology to other companies.
1908000	1911000	Are you listening, Sony or Microsoft?
1911000	1914000	Now, you know, this instantly makes fanboys think about, you know,
1914000	1916000	and actually, let me read this official quote that came from it.
1916000	1918000	This came from company head Joe Virginia.
1918000	1922000	Now, I can't get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology,
1922000	1925000	but as you might imagine, of course, there's more interest out there.
1925000	1927000	So, you know, rumors have been abounding for a long time
1927000	1929000	that Microsoft was gonna get into the whole motion game,
1929000	1932000	although they didn't at E3, which was the expected time.
1932000	1939000	Personally, I don't see the other consoles getting into this whole motion thing and the Motion Plus.
1939000	1941000	You know where I bet this accessory ends up turning up?
1941000	1943000	Again, PC.
1943000	1947000	I bet you we see some type of small scale release of this accessory on a PC.
1947000	1950000	Here's my thing, is like, if you're Nintendo,
1950000	1954000	and you're concerned about having, you know, all your proprietary stuff,
1954000	1960000	why do you put out this peripheral that's supposed to make things better,
1960000	1966000	and supposed to make things extremely lifelike, or very sensitive to your movements,
1966000	1968000	and then you don't make it exclusive to yourself?
1968000	1969000	That's kind of retarded.
1969000	1971000	It's like, I made this really awesome invention!
1971000	1974000	That'll make our game system awesome, and no one else can have it!
1974000	1975000	Oh wait, no they can.
1975000	1977000	Now, Game Guru in chat has a comment that's kind of along those lines.
1977000	1980000	He says, but Nintendo owns the patent on the pointer,
1980000	1982000	and that's the big plus for the Wii.
1982000	1987000	Is that, you know, and granted, if this Motion Plus technology were to be adapted by the other companies,
1987000	1990000	they wouldn't be able to do it in that same style that the Wii does.
1990000	1993000	Yeah, I don't know.
1993000	1997000	Really, I mean, I think this is going to be like Rock Band and Guitar Hero.
1997000	2001000	Maybe PlayStation will adopt this technology and they'll have 12-axis!
2001000	2007000	They'll just, what they'll do is they'll make something that will work exactly the same.
2007000	2010000	It'll be just different enough so that they can't get sued.
2010000	2011000	That's it.
2011000	2014000	Alright, well we'll see what happens.
2014000	2018000	Maybe next year's E3. Who knows? Who knows?
2018000	2020000	So, let's move on.
2020000	2022000	DMN and I are having a fight to the death in the chat room.
2022000	2023000	What, why? Over what?
2023000	2025000	Over Rondo of Blood.
2025000	2027000	We're going to have a fight at PAX.
2027000	2028000	Awesome.
2028000	2031000	But I said that I would win, because girls play dirty.
2031000	2035000	Which, by the way, all three of us are going to be at PAX in like three weeks from today.
2035000	2039000	We are going to be flying home, but we will have just spent the weekend at PAX.
2039000	2045000	He can't use the Elec Beam Pause trick on me because the Blaster Master Grenade trick is stronger.
2045000	2046000	Gaming news?
2046000	2048000	I counter with my Konami code.
2048000	2050000	They're going to LARP to the death.
2050000	2058000	LARP to the death? Dude, that would be an awesome band name.
2058000	2059000	Hey Rob.
2059000	2064000	What? Let's make a band in Rock Band and call it LARP to the death.
2064000	2066000	Alright, sorry, gaming news.
2066000	2070000	Dragon Quest IV. It gets a date in Europe.
2070000	2076000	Which, okay, I'm wondering where the number thing is, because we've got, what, six over here.
2076000	2079000	But they've already had six in Japan, and they're up to, what, eight now?
2079000	2081000	And whatever the hell.
2081000	2083000	Nine on DS soon.
2083000	2087000	I know! And this is the DS one they're talking about.
2087000	2095000	Dragon Quest, the Chapters of the Chosen, which is in the trilogy of The Hand of the Heavenly Bride and the Realms of Reverie coming next.
2095000	2102000	So it's supposed to be released in, okay, here's what it is.
2102000	2110000	Dragon Quest IV was released on the NES in February 1990, and it was Dragon Warrior IV over here.
2110000	2113000	So this is a DS remake is what they're getting.
2113000	2118000	And they said that they're supposed to get it on September 12th over in Europe.
2118000	2120000	So, hey, cool.
2120000	2123000	And you get that, you know, fantastic Toriyama artwork.
2123000	2125000	So, go for it.
2125000	2127000	Cool.
2127000	2130000	The end. Oh, not just the end. There's more.
2130000	2131000	But wait.
2131000	2135000	Even more. More money, more prizes. I love it. Anyway.
2135000	2138000	Someone gets a dollar if they guess what game that's from.
2138000	2140000	Smash TV. Where's my dollar?
2140000	2142000	I've gave you a dollar before.
2142000	2144000	You get a retro dollar, so I've already given it to you.
2144000	2146000	What can I buy with a retro dollar?
2146000	2148000	iTunes Long.
2148000	2149000	Woo!
2149000	2151000	You can buy flashing graphics in-
2151000	2154000	Oh, yeah, I can buy flashing retro graphics.
2154000	2156000	Remember things the way they used to be.
2156000	2157000	Chrono Trigger!
2157000	2158000	Ooh, yes.
2158000	2161000	See, that gets Rob's attention.
2161000	2166000	There has been a kind of date given for Chrono Trigger in Europe.
2166000	2168000	This is for the DS version.
2168000	2174000	They're supposed to get it early 2009, so it's going to be after the US holiday launch.
2174000	2180000	So we're getting it, of course, for the Christmas slash Kwanzaa slash whatever.
2180000	2181000	For Kwanzaa.
2181000	2182000	Yeah.
2182000	2187000	Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Europe never got Chrono Trigger the first time.
2187000	2189000	So this is big for them.
2189000	2191000	I think the PlayStation 1 came out.
2191000	2192000	Really?
2192000	2193000	I think so.
2193000	2195000	I thought the Super Nintendo 1 never did, though.
2195000	2196000	I think you're right.
2196000	2197000	I could be wrong.
2197000	2199000	I thought the Europe date disappeared.
2199000	2202000	Oh, that was for... No, I think that's something else.
2202000	2206000	What was it? What else was I going to say? Was there more? I'm sorry.
2206000	2207000	Yes.
2207000	2208000	Oh, go ahead.
2208000	2209000	Rob. Heart.
2209000	2210000	What?
2210000	2211000	Anyway.
2211000	2216000	But really, the DS version, the things it's going to have is a touchscreen control.
2216000	2223000	You can use both the dual screens, a new dungeon, wireless play of some unnamed variety.
2223000	2229000	And it's actually pretty cool.
2229000	2238000	And there's also, just if anyone is curious, there is a gallery up on Eurogamer that has screenshots.
2238000	2241000	So I'll link that in the chat room if anyone wants to check it out.
2241000	2244000	All right, chat.orangesongerator.com if you want to join our chat room.
2244000	2246000	I thought I knew what it was I wanted to ask you about.
2246000	2250000	Because we were talking about old video games and collecting and all that stuff.
2250000	2251000	42.
2251000	2252000	Okay, sure.
2252000	2253000	Here's the thing.
2253000	2257000	I went to a local record store the other day that was having a big video game sale, used video game sale.
2257000	2261000	I found Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link, in a gold cartridge for $5.
2261000	2262000	Is that a good deal?
2262000	2264000	Yeah, I'd say so.
2264000	2265000	I should have picked that up.
2265000	2270000	Because I was looking at it going, wasn't that the first Zelda they remade in the gray carts?
2270000	2272000	So the gold carts are really valuable?
2272000	2274000	Or am I crazy?
2274000	2276000	Valuable, but they're neat.
2276000	2278000	Especially if you've got the box.
2278000	2281000	It would be worth $5 just to have the old school cart.
2281000	2284000	We can put it up on the wall in the big blank spot we have on Justin TV.
2284000	2285000	I'm pointing at the blank spot.
2285000	2288000	The thing to watch out for those is the battery.
2288000	2289000	Well, I wouldn't play the game.
2289000	2291000	I don't have an old school Nintendo to play it on.
2291000	2293000	Well, I told you I was going to lend you one if I can find one.
2293000	2295000	Can't you replace the battery?
2295000	2297000	You can replace the battery, if I'm right.
2297000	2301000	I think it just uses a standard small lithium battery.
2301000	2304000	We replace the batteries in our Saturn all the time.
2304000	2307000	And I mean all the damn time.
2307000	2308000	Alright, fair enough.
2308000	2310000	Well, alright, let's move on.
2310000	2314000	Sorry to derail the current gaming news, but I just had to know, good deals or not?
2314000	2315000	We're doing a public service.
2315000	2316000	Good deal, bad deal.
2316000	2317000	Good deal, bad deal.
2317000	2319000	Your batteries can be saved.
2319000	2324000	The store was advertising a huge video game blowout, like it was like five games for $13.
2324000	2325000	Okay.
2325000	2328000	The one that used to be a tower.
2328000	2333000	They were advertising a big sale on used games, like five games for $13.
2333000	2335000	I was like, well, I need to go in and see what it is.
2335000	2338000	Okay, guess what all the games were that were $5 for $13?
2338000	2339000	Sports games.
2339000	2342000	All outdated sports games, like NHL, 06.
2342000	2344000	All the games where all the servers got shut down.
2344000	2345000	They can't get rid of them.
2345000	2348000	I went in looking for, what I was looking for in there?
2348000	2350000	Old NES games.
2350000	2352000	They had some in there.
2352000	2353000	Well, yeah.
2353000	2354000	That's where I saw Zelda.
2354000	2362000	Well, originally, before I bought you Blastworks, my intention was to go there and find an original copy of The Guardian Legend,
2362000	2366000	which obviously wouldn't be there because it's too valuable, but, you know.
2366000	2373000	The one time I found a cartridge of The Guardian Legend was at that random store that Rama and company took me to in New York City,
2373000	2374000	the one time I went to visit.
2374000	2381000	But I will tell you what I did find that was freaking awesome that I found at the sale,
2381000	2383000	because not only were they selling video games, but they were selling music,
2383000	2388000	and I found for $2 Paula Abdul Spellbound.
2388000	2389000	Oh, God.
2389000	2391000	That was the one with Rush Rush on it, wasn't it?
2391000	2392000	Yes, it was.
2392000	2393000	I like that song.
2393000	2396000	It also had such awesome songs as The Promise of a New Day,
2396000	2400000	which I was trying to play a clip of here on air, but my computer's freezing up on me, which probably...
2400000	2402000	No, it has a taste screen.
2402000	2403000	Oh, there we go.
2403000	2406000	It has a taste screen.
2406000	2409000	$2 for this.
2409000	2414000	Diet Coke, yo.
2414000	2416000	Alright, please.
2416000	2418000	Promise of a New Game, Loki?
2418000	2420000	Please stop that.
2420000	2424000	There is a pretty cool hack that got released this week on the Wii,
2424000	2434000	and it will allow you to actually play region-free Wii games with no mod chips whatsoever.
2434000	2438000	What this will require, though, is that you have the homebrew channel installed,
2438000	2443000	and when you install this, it will do some other things as well.
2443000	2447000	You can play region-free GameCube games, region-free Wii games.
2447000	2451000	You can have region-free channels.
2451000	2455000	You can also remove the main menu background music.
2455000	2462000	You can go to the Wii's rescue menu that they use for diagnostics.
2462000	2465000	I guess the diagnostic discs.
2465000	2470000	And you can also remove the health warning screen that pops up in the beginning when you turn the Wii on.
2470000	2474000	Well, thank God, because that thing annoys me more than anything.
2474000	2480000	I believe you have to have Wii system version 3.2, I want to say.
2480000	2484000	Unfortunately, if you have it all the way updated now, you can't use this.
2484000	2489000	I'm sorry, I can't stop laughing at the fact that somebody actually sat there and said,
2489000	2491000	you know what I'm going to do to my Wii?
2491000	2493000	You know what project I'm going to take on?
2493000	2501000	I'm going to get rid of that health warning screen, because dammit, that thing's annoying.
2501000	2506000	Meanwhile, people are starving in other countries, and war breaks out.
2506000	2508000	But you got rid of the health warning.
2508000	2513000	Yes, it is. The process to patch it is safe, so you won't brick your console.
2513000	2519000	The only thing that will happen is if you update your console again, it will erase all these updates that you've just made to it.
2519000	2521000	So, that's the only problem.
2521000	2531000	But they are working on ways to prevent that, and like I said, I think it's only compatible right now with version 3.2 firmware.
2531000	2541000	Act deaf to saying in chat that patch is only for Europe, Loki, with patch in quotes.
2541000	2544000	Does anyone really need to remove the health warning screen that bad?
2544000	2551000	I mean, really? Really? Is it that intrusive? Maybe you should be reading it.
2551000	2555000	Anything else in the Wii hacking world going on that we should be aware of?
2555000	2557000	No, that would be it.
2557000	2563000	Well, anyhow, maybe if we hacked some of the more recent Sonic games, we could actually make them good.
2563000	2567000	But some of the more recent Sonic... I'm not talking about classic Sonic. That was always good.
2567000	2572000	I'm talking about the more recent Sonic games, and this is kind of amazing.
2572000	2573000	And yes, it's newsworthy.
2573000	2579000	There was an interview this week that Sega's Vice President of Marketing, Sean Ratcliffe, did with Game Daily.
2579000	2589000	And what apparently Game Daily, in this interview, he says that he kind of admits in a way that Sonic has not been quite as good as it could have been.
2589000	2591000	I mean, he didn't come out and say, Sonic sucks.
2591000	2593000	But there was this interesting quote.
2593000	2595000	Some of that criticism is probably warranted.
2595000	2602000	We definitely recognize that a franchise that has been going as long as Sonic, you have to put a huge amount of effort in to make sure that you maintain that quality.
2602000	2606000	Which is why you're seeing us this year take the first steps in making sure the quality is right.
2606000	2613000	And we're constantly looking at innovation, blending classic 2D gameplay with 3D, beautiful, landscape-rich environments.
2613000	2615000	So, and then continues on.
2615000	2620000	For fans of Sonic that has been looking for the next-gen experience, this is the game they've been waiting for.
2620000	2625000	So, I guess all those other games were just like... I like the way he does that with words.
2625000	2627000	Kind of sweeps the other games under the table.
2627000	2630000	Oh, no, no, this. This is the game you've been waiting for right here.
2630000	2631000	This is the good stuff.
2632000	2633000	Awesome.
2633000	2640000	Mean it. That's all I say. And mean it. Because you only got so many chances left before people just, you know, aren't buying this anymore.
2640000	2647000	But then again, I don't know. You could make 20 crappy Sonic games and if one comes out and it's really good, word will get around. People will buy it.
2647000	2650000	It's just about time they say, yeah, we fucked up.
2650000	2658000	I was going to ask you, as a Sonic fangirl, and general Sega fangirl in general, look at your classic games of the week.
2658000	2669000	The last Sonic game that they did right was the first Sonic Adventure, I thought. And that, and I did like, what was the racing game that they had on PSP? Sonic Rush, wasn't it?
2669000	2670000	I think so.
2670000	2677000	That one was pretty fun, too. But any of the other 3D offerings that they've given, I really didn't find all that exciting.
2677000	2683000	And that one that we played at E3 a couple years ago, the control was absolute shit. So, what the hell, right?
2683000	2684000	Right.
2684000	2686000	Startetsuya says, I concur.
2686000	2695000	They made me cry. They made my soul hurt. They made my soul hurt almost as much as seeing stuff from my childhood used to sell cars.
2695000	2704000	And here's the comment you always see anytime Sega gets brought up by SSJ100. Matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com. Dear Sega, Shenmue 3.
2704000	2709000	I wish they would. Now, I liked the Shenmue series. So, whatever.
2709000	2712000	Shenmue's one of those things that was hokey when it came out, but it aged like a fine wine.
2712000	2715000	It was great. And C-Man.
2715000	2717000	Let's play Lucky Hit.
2717000	2718000	Well, how about something else?
2718000	2720000	How about something else?
2720000	2726000	EA. I know people like to groan and everything, but here's something new to groan about.
2726000	2736000	EA is going to be doing a series of games for PC and DS that is going to be off of the Four Dummies series of books.
2736000	2743000	You can actually, for now, download Poker for Dummies on PC off the Pogo download area.
2743000	2747000	Well, in theory, you're supposed to be able to. That means if it's up there.
2747000	2753000	But there's also going to be Texas Hold'em, Omaha Seven Car Stud.
2753000	2757000	And then there's going to be Solitaire for Dummies, Brain Training for Dummies.
2757000	2762000	That's in October. The Solitaire one's in September. Sudoku for Dummies in November.
2762000	2764000	And a whole bunch more.
2764000	2767000	How about Braid for Dummies? That's what I need.
2767000	2768000	Well, you know what?
2768000	2769000	I'm serious.
2769000	2774000	How about... I want games for smart people.
2774000	2777000	I want, like, Mensa Solitaire.
2777000	2779000	Then you need to go play those, like, cruel games.
2779000	2784000	Like, I Want to Be the Guy or La Mulana or those types of games that are cruel and unusual.
2784000	2787000	No, I mean, like, poker and puzzle and stuff games.
2787000	2791000	I want games... I want Mensa Solitaire.
2791000	2794000	Fair enough, but here's the problem I have with this whole thing.
2794000	2797000	Although it's cute that they have the licensing for dummies,
2797000	2801000	look at the games they're putting out. Sudoku, Solitaire, Texas Hold'em.
2801000	2805000	I mean, we've got, like, 50,000 versions of those games across all the consoles already.
2805000	2811000	What's going to make these so special besides the Four Dummies tagline and the little cartoon guy pointing?
2811000	2815000	The fact that people are admitting to it. That's pretty funny.
2815000	2817000	I guess.
2817000	2823000	But, you know, that makes me think that the Strong Bad game might actually be sort of a parody in the title of that, too.
2823000	2826000	Instead of, you know, For Dummies, you have For Attractive People.
2826000	2830000	Game Guru suggests Sonic For Dummies. Frisbee says Dummies For Dummies.
2830000	2833000	That would be the last few ones.
2833000	2836000	I even... they have For Dummies everything now, so...
2836000	2837000	Yeah, I know.
2837000	2838000	They have Childbirth For Dummies.
2838000	2841000	They have Podcasting For Dummies, a book I was reading last week.
2841000	2843000	Guess what? We didn't need that book.
2843000	2849000	Well, we're living examples of the fact that any dummy can podcast. For real.
2849000	2851000	I thought it took a special kind of dummy.
2851000	2852000	It does.
2852000	2856000	It takes a special sort of self-depreciating dummy to do it every week.
2856000	2862000	No, it takes a special kind of dummy, or dare I say it, idiot, to do it for over six years.
2862000	2865000	And who's coming up on 300?
2865000	2869000	Practically every Sunday straight. I mean, granted, we miss some here and there, but, you know...
2869000	2871000	I don't know. I thought we were a little crooked.
2871000	2874000	We're all a little bent here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2874000	2876000	Hey, how about release dates for dummies?
2876000	2884000	Yes. Well, this week... I hope you like Madden, because that's coming out on everything.
2884000	2888000	Including, God knows why, the original Xbox.
2888000	2892000	Because, you know, that's a viable platform these days.
2892000	2897000	Anyways, so other things coming out other than Madden.
2897000	2902000	I guess this is still kind of Madden-related. You get the Madden PSP bundle coming out this week.
2902000	2911000	There is also some crappy PC games, Sinking Island, and Dracula III Path of the Dragon.
2911000	2914000	What exactly happens in Sinking Island?
2914000	2915000	Well...
2915000	2916000	The island sinks!
2916000	2918000	Oh my God, spoiler alert!
2918000	2921000	And then the ship crashes into an iceberg.
2921000	2924000	I'm glad Jack dies. Oh my God.
2924000	2925000	I'm glad you asked.
2925000	2943000	Sinking Island is about Walter Jones, a billionaire who was found dead at the bottom of a huge art deco tower that he had built as a magnificent getaway on a tropical island.
2943000	2959000	There are ten suspects who all have a motive for Mr. Jones' untimely death, as Inspector Jack Norm, you have three days before the island disappears and sinks into the ocean to find the truth behind this mysterious death and catch the killer.
2959000	2960000	I want this game.
2960000	2964000	It sounds like Clue mixed with the island of Dr. Moreau.
2964000	2968000	Mixed with Bioshock, because it's a tower in the middle of the ocean.
2968000	2974000	You know what? Sometimes these little shitty sounding games are real gems, so you know what? I hope you're wrong. I hope this game is amazing.
2974000	2977000	And I hope the island does sink and you're on it.
2977000	2984000	If that's not amazing enough for you, then maybe the Cheetah Girls Passport to Stardom on the DS would be your type of game.
2984000	2985000	Best week ever!
2985000	2991000	Awesome. Well, here's actually a game that might not be so bad. Space Siege is coming out on the PC.
2991000	2992000	Wait, Space Age?
2992000	2994000	Space Siege, like Dungeon Siege.
2994000	2997000	I was thinking Space Ace in my book for some reason.
2997000	3000000	Hopefully there will not be a movie being made for this.
3000000	3004000	Also this week, Imagine Teacher.
3004000	3007000	For you to teach your Imagine Babies. I don't know.
3007000	3009000	Yes, Imagine Teacher.
3009000	3013000	Imagine Teacher. I am a teacher, kind of. I teach adults. That's my day job.
3013000	3017000	This game you actually have to create lesson plans and stuff like that.
3017000	3020000	Wow. I'm kind of curious about this game.
3020000	3026000	Silent Hunter 4, the Gold Edition, is coming out on PC as well.
3026000	3031000	Ford Racing Off-Road, also for the PC.
3031000	3035000	And... Oh, did I forget to mention?
3035000	3037000	Madden the 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition.
3037000	3041000	So that's a whole bunch of Madden and a whole bunch of stuff.
3041000	3049000	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it on the list, but I think Line Rider 2 is supposed to be coming out this week.
3049000	3055000	Although, judging that I don't see it on this list anymore, it might have been delayed.
3055000	3060000	And if you want to check out Madden, but you don't feel like shelling out that kind of money,
3060000	3066000	you could probably find Madden 05 or Madden 04 for about 2 bucks this week at certain closeout sales.
3066000	3070000	Yeah, we've got like 900 copies of Madden 05.
3070000	3071000	Nice.
3071000	3073000	We'll sell them cheap.
3073000	3076000	Can you melt them down in a landfill or something like that?
3076000	3078000	I've told them to throw them away.
3078000	3083000	Well, let's travel over to Japan and Asia in general. Sometimes we cover the Asian release dates as well.
3083000	3088000	Madden NFL 09 will come out in Asia as well the same day it comes out here in the US.
3088000	3094000	Meanwhile, Tales of Vesperia, the Japanese version, also makes its way to other Asian regions this week.
3094000	3097000	Otherwise, in Japan itself, nothing on the Xbox 360 this week.
3097000	3099000	How about on the PlayStation 3?
3099000	3101000	Same story. There's really nothing new.
3101000	3105000	You're going to have to wait until the 21st when Vampire Rain comes out for something new.
3105000	3108000	Moving on to the Wii.
3108000	3110000	Nothing there either.
3110000	3113000	It's a very slow week in Japan.
3113000	3116000	I guess just not a lot of demand.
3116000	3119000	Do you think they're all importing Madden or what the hell's going on?
3119000	3120000	I don't know.
3120000	3121000	Olympics?
3121000	3122000	Well, I guess I could be.
3122000	3129000	On the PlayStation 2, Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka Para Iro is coming out in regular and limited edition.
3129000	3131000	That is one new release you're getting this week.
3131000	3137000	It's an adventure game that stars cute anime girls and cute anime cutscenes.
3137000	3139000	Your favorite. It looks like one of the girls is a radio DJ.
3139000	3143000	Perhaps she's a podcaster.
3143000	3144000	Perhaps.
3144000	3155000	This could be Dark Sakura if she had blonde hair and a disproportionate size boobies and one eye strangely larger than the other.
3155000	3157000	Sometimes I wish you sat on cam because that was really funny.
3157000	3158000	Hell no.
3158000	3159000	That was really funny.
3159000	3160000	I've had blonde hair before.
3160000	3161000	Really?
3161000	3162000	It sucks.
3162000	3163000	Really? I'd like to see that.
3163000	3164000	You've seen me with blonde bangs.
3164000	3165000	I have seen you with blonde bangs.
3165000	3167000	I did not look good at all.
3167000	3170000	Wow. Alright. Fair enough.
3170000	3173000	Coming out on the Nintendo DS, a game called...
3173000	3175000	I'm sorry. It's not a game. It's an accessory.
3175000	3179000	Accessories for your DS to make it look like Stitch from Leo and Stitch or Jack Skellington.
3179000	3180000	That looks kind of cool.
3180000	3183000	Or Pooh from Winnie the Pooh.
3183000	3184000	You can check those out.
3184000	3186000	Otherwise, on the DS, there's no games coming out this week.
3186000	3188000	You can make it look like Pooh.
3188000	3190000	That's a really slow week.
3190000	3194000	On the PSP, Crazy Taxi Double Punch, which I thought we talked about last week.
3194000	3196000	It must have gotten delayed.
3196000	3201000	Also, Memories of Sorikata is coming out on the PSP from Cyberfront.
3201000	3207000	And it looks to be another game starring Anime Girls.
3207000	3209000	Ah, yes. I found Line Rider 2.
3209000	3211000	Delayed to September. Not surprised.
3211000	3212000	Nope.
3212000	3215000	So, a slow week in Japan as well. Sorry to say.
3215000	3218000	How about the UK, Dark Soccer? Same story over there or what?
3218000	3223000	There's a few things. Not really many, I guess.
3223000	3227000	We have Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, Episode 1.
3227000	3230000	Homestar Ruiner on PC and Wii.
3230000	3233000	Fabled 2 Pub Games on Xbox 360.
3233000	3235000	Ferrari Challenge on Wii.
3235000	3238000	Madden NFL 2009 on Xbox 360 and Wii.
3238000	3240000	Puzzler Collection on Wii.
3240000	3243000	And Table Football on Wii.
3243000	3245000	Well, that's a Wii-tastic week.
3245000	3246000	Madden.
3246000	3250000	All I've been hearing about that is Madden since my husband has to work the launch.
3250000	3252000	Plus, and Loki made a good point earlier.
3252000	3255000	This isn't a good week to release games with the Olympics going on.
3255000	3258000	And that is something that affects the world, in a way.
3258000	3261000	Because there are lots and lots of people watching the Olympics.
3261000	3264000	I don't even really watch sports, usually, on TV.
3264000	3266000	But I'll watch diving.
3266000	3270000	You know my calendar? I have the Freakonomics calendar.
3270000	3277000	It actually stated why they wanted it specifically to be August 8, 2008.
3277000	3281000	To have the Olympics open is because 8 is a lucky number in China.
3281000	3287000	Exactly. Apparently there was a huge amount of couples that got married on 8-8-0-8.
3287000	3290000	Because of the significance of the lucky number.
3290000	3295000	But I just wanted to say, isn't it interesting how there's two sports that everybody seems to tune into?
3295000	3300000	Depending on what your preferences are. There's men's diving, and there's women's volleyball.
3300000	3303000	You know what I actually always enjoy watching?
3303000	3305000	I actually like the gymnastics.
3305000	3307000	Gymnastics is fun to watch.
3307000	3308000	For both.
3308000	3309000	Just for whatever.
3309000	3310000	And that and women's swimming.
3310000	3315000	Women's volleyball still got the same outfits they had four years ago?
3315000	3319000	I don't know. Those women are kind of like, you know, female gym teachers anyways.
3319000	3320000	And no thanks.
3320000	3321000	Not really.
3321000	3324000	Also, though, I actually have to crack up.
3324000	3331000	Because I want to see if anyone makes the same mistake that the target shoot guy did last year.
3331000	3335000	And to hit the target beyond his target?
3335000	3339000	That's pretty awesome. However, he did not hit his target.
3339000	3343000	Is Geena Davis going to be doing archery this year? That's what I want to know.
3343000	3347000	Because, you know, Thelma is an archer.
3347000	3349000	Forget it.
3349000	3354000	I was going to say, my favorite events are the ninjutsu events.
3354000	3355000	The what?
3355000	3357000	The ninjutsu events.
3357000	3358000	They have ninja events?
3358000	3359000	I like fencing.
3359000	3360000	You never see them?
3360000	3362000	No. Shut up.
3362000	3363000	He likes curling.
3363000	3364000	Gaming, nudes.
3364000	3367000	Dude, curling is awesome. That's the best part of deca sports.
3367000	3370000	Alright, that's the best part of the summer event.
3370000	3371000	Shut up.
3371000	3374000	Gaming, nudes.
3374000	3375000	Fable 2.
3375000	3379000	They've made the announcement that's coming out October 21st in the US.
3379000	3381000	October 24th in Europe.
3381000	3387000	And, of course, along with that, they are going to be getting the Fable 2 collector's edition.
3387000	3392000	Which includes some, I guess they're like tarot cards.
3392000	3396000	A bonus DVD with some behind the scenes stuff.
3396000	3399000	Also a little figurine.
3399000	3409000	And if you pre-order your games now, as Jamie mentioned, the Xbox Live Arcade pub games will be available starting August 13th.
3409000	3416000	One other cool thing, though, that you get with the limited edition is Master Chief.
3416000	3419000	Created in Fable 2.
3419000	3421000	As opposed to Master Chef.
3421000	3423000	Using the character creator.
3423000	3425000	Interesting.
3425000	3426000	I suppose.
3426000	3427000	That's pretty cool.
3427000	3434000	Although, he looked a little weird. I mean, it's kind of like taking a character that looks kind of like him and calling him Master Chief.
3434000	3435000	It's weird.
3435000	3442000	Well, they had something like this that they did during a demonstration at U3 where they created a character like this and I guess they kind of tweaked it a little bit more.
3442000	3445000	I don't know. It's neat. He has a lot of belts.
3445000	3448000	A lot of belts.
3448000	3449000	I don't know.
3449000	3454000	I mean, I'm getting the limited edition because I like crap like that.
3454000	3456000	I don't know.
3456000	3461000	Alright, I apologize in advance if I'm horribly mispronouncing the name of this thing.
3461000	3464000	It's Oni Chambara? Is that what that is?
3464000	3465000	That's correct.
3465000	3467000	Alright, my Japanese is getting better.
3467000	3471000	Just disregard that. You might want to know this game as Bikini Samurai Squad.
3471000	3474000	It's still Oni Chambara. That's just a subtitle.
3474000	3476000	Whatever, but look.
3476000	3477000	It's chicks.
3477000	3479000	Speaking of women's volleyball outfits.
3479000	3481000	It's chicks in bikinis wielding swords.
3481000	3484000	I mean, hello. Do you need anything more in a video game?
3484000	3486000	The only thing this game is missing is zombies.
3486000	3488000	Oh, wait. I think they have those too.
3488000	3490000	They're battling a zombie horde.
3490000	3492000	I mean, do games get any better? I think not.
3492000	3495000	It's a chick wearing lingerie with a cowboy hat.
3495000	3496000	You forgot the cowboy hat.
3496000	3497000	Oh, my bad.
3497000	3500000	And she has a samurai sword killing zombies.
3500000	3509000	I already told you this is the greatest game on the face of the earth except for maybe Earth Defense Force which, please God, make another Earth Defense Force game.
3509000	3511000	Seriously?
3511000	3517000	This game is the second game I've been waiting to come over here from the Simple series and thank God it's finally here.
3517000	3530000	It is coming out over here. D3 publisher is going to port the game to the US in hopes that people everywhere will bow down to women with swords in bikinis slashing zombies.
3530000	3532000	Dark Sakura sound like your kind of game?
3532000	3533000	That sounds like fun.
3533000	3534000	I know, it does sound like fun.
3534000	3537000	If you don't want it on 360, remember they do have the Wii version coming out as well.
3537000	3538000	Alright.
3538000	3540000	Wii!
3540000	3547000	You know, I almost, I almost brought my Wii today to bring that, to view that game.
3547000	3548000	Next week though.
3548000	3549000	Next week.
3549000	3550000	Or whenever.
3550000	3551000	I must see this game.
3551000	3555000	You know, we should just have a special playing that are pre-recording.
3555000	3556000	Ooh, that might work.
3556000	3559000	Get that game imported or whatever you gotta do. Let's check it out.
3559000	3560000	Alright.
3560000	3561000	Already have it, yeah.
3561000	3562000	Sweet.
3562000	3571000	Well, other news, so you know we've been sitting around speculating about why Final Fantasy 13 is going to be coming out on Xbox 360?
3571000	3573000	Well, Microsoft has said something.
3573000	3586000	Actually one of their marketers, Albert Panello, said that it was actually the Xbox 360 sales, like I had speculated before, were what would bring Final Fantasy 13 to the system.
3586000	3592000	They said that they didn't really make any sort of behind doors deal.
3592000	3602000	They didn't offer a lot of money for them to, for Squeenix to break their exclusivity contract.
3602000	3604000	I can't speak today.
3604000	3605000	That's alright.
3605000	3606000	I've had a crap week.
3606000	3607000	They offered the market share.
3607000	3608000	That's what they offered them.
3608000	3609000	Exactly.
3609000	3614000	Xbox 360 does have the superior market in the United States.
3614000	3619000	So far they've had more term on it, more sales overall.
3619000	3629000	And they're actually stating right now that that was the specific reason that Square said, you know what, let's just do it.
3629000	3631000	Let's put it out on the 360 in the US.
3631000	3637000	And they also are committed to a simultaneous launch for both of them.
3637000	3642000	But their speculation is that that's going to hold up our PS3 release date in the US.
3642000	3651000	But, depending on how long they've had this going, you know, had this idea forming, they may have already started work on the port.
3651000	3652000	I could hope so.
3652000	3656000	They swear they haven't and they're not going to, but you never know.
3656000	3660000	I saw the note on there that says they haven't begun work on the 360 version yet.
3660000	3661000	But it could be a lie.
3661000	3662000	You know what I mean?
3662000	3663000	It could be a lie.
3663000	3665000	They don't have to tell us the truth.
3665000	3666000	It's very true.
3666000	3668000	But it likely is the truth.
3668000	3669000	I mean, why would they lie?
3669000	3675000	I mean, it could be that they've started, you know, work on one that could just be easily converted to either platform.
3675000	3680000	Well, my whole thought is they had to explore the fact that it was doable, right?
3680000	3691000	Well, I don't think that they, what they do when they start programming these games is just, you're not going to have, oh, we are going to do everything on this dev kit.
3691000	3695000	No, you're going to start your textures in whatever your 3D program is.
3695000	3698000	You're going to start working, you know, laying out your scripts and, you know, other programs.
3698000	3705000	It's not, it's got to come together on a PC or Mac or something, or maybe they do it in Linux.
3705000	3706000	I don't know.
3706000	3714000	But anyway, whatever way they have to come through it on some sort of computer to get everything together.
3714000	3718000	And then it's made compatible with the hardware given.
3718000	3729000	So I think it's not going to be that difficult, especially since we've seen plenty of ports from one system to the other that didn't lose all that much, so.
3729000	3731000	All right, let's get some comments from chat.
3731000	3736000	JV Mon says, I don't mind Final Fantasy 13 being delayed if it means I get it on the 360.
3736000	3741000	Keltipo says, Final Fantasy 13 seems so far off at this point, another delay doesn't seem so bad.
3741000	3742000	That's kind of how I feel.
3742000	3749000	I mean, it's like, it's that little spark way off in the distance that, you know, I'm kind of not expecting to see this game before Christmas next year anyway.
3749000	3750000	So there you have it.
3750000	3754000	Chat.orangelaundry.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night as we tape on allgames.com.
3754000	3758000	As we always do, 6 o'clock Pacific time on Sunday nights, except for next week.
3758000	3767000	Besides, you have to remember the development cycle starts off with their department for making kickass CG trailers for said game before they even work on the game.
3767000	3771000	So, possibly, you might be onto something.
3771000	3775000	Especially when the final looks nothing like the trailer.
3775000	3776000	Let's move on.
3776000	3779000	We've got the classic game of the week coming up in just a couple more stories in our break.
3779000	3781000	And then part B. Loki.
3781000	3784000	Besides, I have one question for you.
3784000	3787000	What is better than Final Fantasy 13?
3787000	3789000	Well, I'll answer that with another question.
3789000	3791000	Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
3791000	3793000	Damn straight, that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
3793000	3795000	Game of the year right there.
3795000	3797000	Will it have Jeff Foxworthy?
3797000	3799000	Yes, it will have CG Jeff Foxworthy.
3799000	3801000	He looks like a zombie, by the way. I don't know.
3801000	3805000	Can a fifth grader beat Braid? If so, I'm in trouble.
3805000	3807000	I don't know, maybe.
3807000	3812000	Is this going to be one of their massively online games that we're teasing at E3, like 1 versus 100?
3812000	3817000	No, I'm going to guess this is going to be their crappy port of the Wii game that's coming out.
3817000	3822000	But it is being put out by THQ, which I do think they are putting out the crappy game.
3822000	3830000	And yeah, it should be coming out sometime after all the cool games come out on Xbox Live Arcade this month.
3830000	3832000	Oh well.
3832000	3834000	Hey, wait, is Xbox Live Arcade?
3834000	3836000	Xbox Live Arcade.
3836000	3838000	Well, that's kind of interesting, I guess.
3838000	3842000	So I can embarrass myself and my friends online with what I don't know.
3842000	3844000	Yeah.
3844000	3846000	Although usually I seem to watch the show and I seem to do okay on the show.
3846000	3849000	But sometimes there's like a world history question that I just don't get.
3849000	3853000	Because history was never my strong subject.
3853000	3855000	I don't know, he's just creepy looking, man.
3855000	3859000	Seriously, it's like, if you get this question wrong, I'm going to jump through the TV and eat your brain.
3859000	3861000	Look how small his head is!
3861000	3865000	His head's shaped like a cantaloupe.
3865000	3869000	I'm going to show the chat room what his head looks like, okay?
3869000	3873000	Look at his head!
3873000	3879000	DarkTetsuya says, bye, give me the mole on Xbox Live Arcade. Reality games on Xbox Live Arcade, I don't think that could happen, though.
3879000	3883000	They're too psychological intensive.
3883000	3887000	Anyway, speaking of Xbox Live Arcade games, we've been talking a lot, a lot, a lot about Braid tonight.
3887000	3889000	A lot of people have been talking about Braid.
3889000	3894000	What's very interesting, though, have you checked out the official walkthrough for Braid?
3894000	3897000	The creator, Jonathan Blow, actually put up an official walkthrough for Braid.
3897000	3901000	It's available at braid-game.com slash walkthrough.
3901000	3903000	I'm going to go ahead and give you a spoiler for the walkthrough.
3903000	3911000	The first page tells you how to power up the game, how to get into the actual game itself from the sunset-looking starting screen.
3911000	3915000	And then you go into page two of the game after you get walked through the first world.
3915000	3921000	And page two tells you, solve the puzzles yourself and stop using a walkthrough.
3921000	3923000	You stupid dork!
3923000	3925000	All the puzzles in Braid are reasonable.
3925000	3928000	If you're having problems solving a puzzle, don't give up.
3928000	3932000	Please do not use a walkthrough. Don't give up. Thank you for your time.
3932000	3940000	And yet, might I point out the irony that currently this game is sitting at number three on the most requested FAQs on GameFAQs.
3940000	3943000	Probably from people feeling as dumb as me.
3943000	3950000	However, I will say, though, there are rewards to be got from this game, like any game, from not using a walkthrough.
3950000	3955000	That's not going to stop some people that want to know the story, and there is going to come a point where I'm just not going to be able to freaking resist.
3955000	3961000	But I do like the little trick played on us by the official developers. I thought it was cute, if nothing else.
3961000	3965000	And that was something I found, by the way, on Major Nels' Twitter, which you were saying earlier in the show.
3965000	3968000	I've been thinking that's major use.
3968000	3971000	And there's some pretty funny stuff that he posts every so often.
3971000	3974000	You should also add on the Xbox staff, Trixie's there.
3974000	3977000	She posts a lot more random stuff, but she's a good read, too.
3977000	3981000	There's a lot of great gaming people on Twitter. That's like the place where everybody's at right now.
3981000	3983000	I have Twitterrific on my iPhone.
3983000	3986000	There's so many other indie game podcasters I'm following on Twitter.
3986000	3990000	Godfree, Gamer Edie, Bobby, just off the top of my head.
3990000	3995000	On top of that, there's other famous individuals on there. Will Wheaton has a Twitter.
3995000	3996000	So I've been reading that.
3996000	3998000	Dude, Obama is following me.
3998000	4000000	No, that's how I found his Twitter.
4000000	4001000	Nice.
4001000	4006000	And I was like, dude, I'm not even anything on there that says anything about being Democrat.
4006000	4008000	I'm a Libertarian.
4008000	4010000	Although I'm voting for him.
4010000	4014000	Alright. Danger, danger, political discussion, danger.
4014000	4017000	I can say who I'm voting for.
4017000	4018000	Alright.
4018000	4020000	Let's get into other topics, though.
4020000	4025000	Like your vote for the Classic Game of the Week that all the kids should be playing this week.
4025000	4028000	Because every week you like to pick a game from the archives.
4028000	4032000	And this week, as I understand it, we have a nice change of pace.
4032000	4034000	It's not Sega-related this week.
4034000	4035000	Sort of.
4035000	4037000	I'm just messing with you.
4037000	4039000	Alright, here it is, folks, your Classic Game of the Week.
4039000	4044000	What should the kiddies be dusting off and playing this week?
4044000	4047000	I think this also wins the About Damn Time award, too.
4047000	4050000	Because the game that I picked is Tempest 2000.
4050000	4051000	Nice.
4051000	4055000	Tempest 2000 is one of the only good games on the Atari Jaguar.
4055000	4060000	It is the only Atari Jaguar game that I have ever used in this segment.
4060000	4064000	And I'm actually referring to the Sega Saturn version, which is the one that I have.
4064000	4067000	So, screw a bunch of the Atari Jaguar.
4067000	4072000	I have played this on the Jaguar, believe it or not, and I endorse it on the Jaguar.
4072000	4073000	It's a good time.
4073000	4074000	You just have to play the music.
4074000	4076000	Let's take a listen to some of the hot techno music in the game.
4083000	4084000	Remember this?
4084000	4085000	Oh, hell yeah.
4085000	4086000	Super Zapper Recharge.
4086000	4089000	Remember the soundtrack I burned off of this resolution to?
4089000	4090000	Nice.
4090000	4091000	Good times.
4091000	4093000	Anyway, tell us a little more about Tempest 2000.
4093000	4099000	Well, if anyone's ever played the original Tempest, it was a vector game that was put
4099000	4106000	out by Atari where you go on a series of different shaped fields.
4106000	4112000	And you can only move left or right for yourself, but you'll have ones that look like a V or
4112000	4114000	some that look like a giant octagon.
4114000	4118000	Or the first stage is basically a straight plane.
4118000	4123000	But this one, other than just shooting the little ships as they approach your ship on
4123000	4128000	this plane, you have other little goodies added.
4128000	4131000	You also have spikes that come up.
4131000	4134000	I think the spikes were in the original, too, that you have to shoot the spikes all the
4134000	4136000	way back down to the bottom.
4136000	4140000	They will try to, you know, if the enemy ship gets up to the top of the plane, they can
4140000	4141000	catch you.
4141000	4146000	Now, what they've added to this one is you get a particle laser so that you can shoot
4146000	4149000	faster and, you know, more energy.
4149000	4156000	You can gain points for, you know, bonus ships and stuff.
4156000	4160000	You can get a jump power-up so you can jump over the enemies when they're on the top line.
4160000	4166000	An AI droid, which is just this little vector cube that follows you around and shoots.
4166000	4168000	A warp token so you can...
4168000	4170000	Wait, wait, wait, we have to listen to this part.
4170000	4177000	Oh, this version doesn't have the voice, did it?
4177000	4178000	No, it says it really quietly.
4178000	4180000	Super Zapper Recharge is added on the...
4180000	4182000	Super Zapper Recharge is the best part.
4182000	4187000	Well, you know why this has better music and better musical quality than the Jaguar did?
4187000	4194000	Because the Saturn has a much, much better sound processor than the Jaguar did.
4194000	4199000	In fact, I want to even say that the Saturn sound processor was better than what was on
4199000	4200000	the PlayStation.
4200000	4201000	Do we get to see the bonus stage in this clip?
4201000	4203000	Because that part of the game always tripped me out.
4203000	4204000	I didn't watch that movie.
4204000	4205000	Oh, that's alright.
4205000	4208000	It had the weird ambient music too.
4208000	4210000	Let me turn it down a little bit because those gunshots are getting a little annoying.
4210000	4211000	Alright, go ahead.
4211000	4212000	Sorry.
4212000	4220000	But you also, as you go through, you can get warp tokens to travel to different stages.
4220000	4227000	You can also get a power-up to destroy all of the enemies that are on the screen and
4227000	4229000	move you to the next level.
4229000	4231000	It's called Outta Here.
4231000	4233000	You get one that...
4233000	4239000	Well, the female voice in there goes, yes, yes, yes, when you get this power-up.
4239000	4243000	And you get it when you're warping off a completed one.
4243000	4246000	So it gives that...
4246000	4252000	So when you start your next level, the first power-up that you get is an AI droid.
4252000	4259000	And it says yes, yes, yes, but in that, you know, really high-pitched sort of oh baby
4259000	4260000	way.
4260000	4261000	Eat electric death.
4261000	4262000	I love that.
4262000	4267000	When you use your giant zapper thing, it says eat electric death.
4267000	4269000	It just happened in the clip here, eat electric death.
4269000	4270000	I know, that's so cool.
4270000	4271000	Caught you.
4271000	4272000	Guy died.
4272000	4274000	And when it says catch, it goes whoa.
4274000	4279000	So we've also got other versions, like this particular music that we're playing here is
4279000	4282000	like I said, the Sega Saturn version.
4282000	4286000	It did first come out on Atari Jaguar.
4286000	4292000	There was a PlayStation version that's called Tempest X3.
4292000	4297000	It's supposed to be updated graphics and music, but it's...
4297000	4301000	Actually, I don't think it's as much fun.
4301000	4310000	However, if you put in all caps Y-I-F-F exclamation point on the high score table, you get to play
4310000	4311000	the original Tempest 2000.
4311000	4312000	Nice.
4312000	4314000	But it doesn't save any of your high scores, so that's kind of sad.
4314000	4315000	They also have this on PC, right?
4315000	4316000	Because I remember playing this on PC.
4316000	4320000	Yes, there's a PC version, which I've got it somewhere.
4320000	4324000	There's also...
4324000	4326000	You can actually get a soundtrack for it.
4326000	4329000	I mean, although, honestly, with the Saturn version, all you have to do, it's all Redbook
4329000	4330000	audio.
4330000	4333000	There's been other games that try to be like Tempest since Tempest 2000.
4333000	4334000	I don't know.
4334000	4335000	I apologize.
4335000	4336000	You were going to talk about this, but...
4336000	4337000	There was Space Giraffe.
4337000	4342000	Yes, Space Giraffe on Xbox Live, but the problem with Space Giraffe is that it was kind of
4342000	4346000	funny, like it had its moments that it was really funny, but the problem I had with it
4346000	4348000	is that graphically, the game was ruined.
4348000	4352000	I mean, how graphics can single-handedly ruin a game.
4352000	4358000	And the same problem I had with Tempest on Xbox Live Arcade, they remade the original
4358000	4361000	Tempest, did this whole remake of the original Tempest, it was missing that...
4361000	4363000	There's a Tempest 3000.
4363000	4367000	There's that X factor I can't put my finger on that Tempest 2000 had that the Tempest
4367000	4369000	on Xbox Live Arcade most definitely doesn't have.
4369000	4373000	I do have to tell you one thing, though, that I do really like about the PlayStation version,
4373000	4377000	Tempest 6.3, is it used the NegCon.
4377000	4383000	The NegCon for the uninitiated is a Namco controller that you...
4383000	4385000	It's separate in the center, so it twists.
4385000	4388000	It was made for Wipeout and other racing games.
4388000	4389000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4389000	4390000	All right.
4390000	4391000	I have four of them, so...
4391000	4392000	Nice.
4392000	4396000	It took me forever to find them, but I have two Japanese ones and two American ones.
4396000	4402000	But the other thing that I think is interesting is that anyone likes the music in this one,
4402000	4406000	it was actually done by Imagine Design, which is now Brilliant Development, and they did
4406000	4410000	the music for Jaguar Games, Alien vs. Predator, and Battlemorph.
4410000	4417000	And I do recall Alien vs. Predator actually having some pretty sweet music.
4417000	4422000	You can also use the Jaguar's rotary controller on this, too, so you can get your sort of
4422000	4424000	old-school stuff.
4424000	4428000	So what you do to get that is you pause on controller one and controller two at the same
4428000	4435000	time on the options menu, and you can choose the rotary controller.
4435000	4438000	However, the rotary controller actually never was released.
4438000	4439000	Nice, nice.
4439000	4442000	You know, what do we say about the Jaguar?
4442000	4444000	It sucked!
4444000	4446000	Well, you know what?
4446000	4447000	I take that back.
4447000	4451000	Because there were other... there was another couple of good games, but I think they were
4451000	4453000	also remade original.
4453000	4455000	Yeah, anything that was on the Jaguar, it was good.
4455000	4456000	It was probably remade.
4456000	4461000	But at any rate, there have been people who actually went out and made a rotary controller,
4461000	4467000	so you can find them online somewhere, and people have modified old 2600 controllers
4467000	4469000	that are doing that, too.
4469000	4479000	But anyway, it was designed by Jeff Minter, and so I say go check out some of his other
4479000	4483000	contributions, too, even though he did give us Space Giraffe.
4483000	4484000	All right.
4484000	4485000	So that's it, then?
4485000	4487000	Tempest 2000, Classic Game of the Week?
4487000	4490000	I was really just trying to talk a whole lot so you could keep your music playing and
4490000	4491000	you could highlight your music.
4491000	4493000	Well, the clip's about up, so there you have it.
4493000	4495000	Your Classic Game of the Week, Tempest 2000.
4495000	4497000	Favorite thing about the game in a nutshell?
4497000	4499000	It's awesome.
4499000	4500000	There's not a favorite thing.
4500000	4502000	It's the entire package.
4502000	4504000	It's the whole thing is one.
4504000	4505000	Fair enough.
4505000	4506000	I will accept that answer.
4506000	4507000	All right.
4507000	4510000	That's going to do it for our Classic Game of the Week and for part A here on Orange
4510000	4511000	Lounge Radio.
4511000	4512000	Stay tuned, guys.
4512000	4517000	We'll be right back after a quick free break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4517000	4525000	She's calm.
4525000	4527000	There are a couple of other things I just tell you and I remember.
4527000	4528000	He's crazy.
4528000	4532000	If you could not see the similarities and the personalities within the first couple
4532000	4534000	of episodes, you'd need brain surgery.
4534000	4535000	I mean, seriously.
4535000	4539000	Can two people get together and record a podcast without driving each other crazy?
4539000	4540000	Slap.
4540000	4542000	Oh, you just have to hit me so hard.
4542000	4543000	It wasn't that hard.
4543000	4548000	Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your host, DJ Ranma S and Kuro Usagi.
4548000	4555000	Log on to DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.
4555000	4560000	How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?
4560000	4564000	We should have a rape carnival.
4564000	4569000	Tell them to rape things because rape is funny.
4569000	4571000	Walk around the neighborhood and rape cats in your neighborhood.
4571000	4572000	Hold a plastic knife.
4572000	4574000	You have to have a plastic knife.
4574000	4577000	And take pictures.
4577000	4581000	Ladies and gentlemen, rape isn't funny.
4581000	4588000	Unless if it's clown rape.
4588000	4590000	Rape of people is not funny.
4590000	4593000	Rape of monsters is funny.
4593000	4595000	Because monsters are bad.
4595000	4596000	And when bad people...
4596000	4597000	What?
4597000	4598000	I'm just not going to keep going.
4598000	4599000	Let go of the shovel.
4599000	4600000	Yeah, I'm digging myself a hole.
4600000	4602000	Orange Lounge Radio.
4602000	4606000	The video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.
4606000	4610000	Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.
4610000	4616000	To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.
4616000	4618000	Well, except that asshole.
4618000	4621000	And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4621000	4626000	There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games
4626000	4631000	and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.
4631000	4633000	He doesn't even fucking make sense.
4633000	4635000	Welcome back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4635000	4639000	August the 10th of 2008 is the night we are taping live.
4639000	4641000	Myself, Rob Roberts, joining me as always.
4641000	4642000	DarkSakura.
4642000	4643000	Hi!
4643000	4646000	Back for more gaming news after feeling a little...
4646000	4649000	I had some pretzels to snack on during the break there.
4649000	4651000	And some vitamin water to refresh me now.
4651000	4654000	Even though they say this stuff is really not as good for you as you'd think.
4654000	4655000	I'm full of energy.
4655000	4656000	It's better than soda.
4656000	4657000	Good!
4657000	4658000	Lots of energy.
4658000	4659000	Lots of energy to get through gaming news?
4659000	4660000	Yes!
4660000	4661000	How about you, Loki?
4661000	4663000	Are you energetic?
4663000	4664000	No.
4664000	4665000	I guess not.
4665000	4667000	Will you mind doing some gaming news for us anyway?
4667000	4668000	Yeah.
4668000	4669000	Alright, sure.
4669000	4673000	So, it's already been rumored that it's coming out at some point.
4673000	4680000	But Guitar Hero Metallica was pretty much confirmed by Metallica themselves
4680000	4683000	during an interview with Lars Orch.
4683000	4686000	And basically, the quote is,
4686000	4689000	if somebody's going to follow up Guitar Hero Aerosmith,
4689000	4693000	we're talking and it's exciting.
4693000	4699000	And the people at Guitar Hero and Activision are rapidly becoming our best new friends in the world.
4699000	4702000	You can put the rest of it together yourself.
4702000	4704000	So, yeah.
4704000	4709000	Guitar Hero Metallica, once again, horing up the franchise next year.
4709000	4713000	But there's going to be a lot of people that are going to buy this game, even more so than Aerosmith.
4713000	4714000	Yeah, probably.
4714000	4716000	Aerosmith's a pretty rockin' band, don't get me wrong.
4716000	4719000	But Metallica's even more so.
4719000	4721000	Metallica is godly.
4721000	4724000	Even after the backlash of Napster and all that.
4724000	4725000	We kind of forgot about that.
4725000	4727000	It's really to enlighten St. Inger.
4727000	4732000	Am I one of the few people on the planet that actually liked Reload and Load, those albums?
4732000	4733000	I loved it!
4733000	4734000	I thought those albums were pretty good.
4734000	4738000	The best part of those albums was the fact that Mary Ann Faithfull was on a song.
4738000	4739000	It was so rad.
4739000	4743000	But nothing ever tops the awesome that was the S&M concert.
4743000	4746000	Oh, was that the orchestra?
4746000	4747000	The one was Cayman.
4747000	4750000	And the, um, what was it?
4750000	4751000	Berkeley, I think?
4751000	4754000	Yeah, it was local from where they're from.
4754000	4759000	Yeah, I just thought it was funny that people who bought season passes for theater and opera had to listen to Metallica.
4759000	4761000	Comments from our chat room.
4761000	4762000	chat.orangelandradio.com
4762000	4763000	ActDeaf says,
4763000	4768000	Lars is a big sellout, according to ActDeaf, so there are still some people that are Metallica hatin'.
4768000	4769000	JV Monn says,
4769000	4772000	My store still has dozens and dozens of Guitar Hero Aerosmiths still in my store.
4772000	4773000	You know, I've noticed the same thing.
4773000	4780000	Loki, any idea, I don't know if you know anything from the inside, but any idea on how Aerosmith Guitar Hero's been selling?
4780000	4784000	Um, we sold a lot of it, and then...
4784000	4785000	That's about it.
4785000	4787000	No, not a lot of reorders.
4787000	4789000	So, okay, isn't that bad, though, when there's not a lot of reorders?
4789000	4792000	Because that means the ones that were bought for the shelves aren't leaving.
4792000	4793000	Isn't that bad?
4793000	4794000	Uh, could be.
4794000	4797000	I mean, I'm not trying to distort the facts or whatever, maybe they are selling really good, but...
4797000	4801000	Well, just have a look at the NPD numbers at the end of, uh, for July to see how it did.
4801000	4804000	Actually, though, it'd probably still be doing pretty well through July.
4804000	4808000	Maybe the NPD number is in September for August to see how well it's doing.
4808000	4809000	Hmm. Alright, good.
4809000	4816000	Because, um, you know, it sold a lot, but, you know, a lot of people were just picking it up for the hell of it, I guess, I don't know.
4816000	4817000	Uh, JV Monn continues,
4817000	4822000	JV Monn continues, Guitar Hero Aerosmith sold really well the first week, then people stopped carrying.
4822000	4830000	I do intend on picking it up, but, again, I'm holding out for a price drop, and if they're not leaving shelves, maybe that'll happen sooner than people were telling me it was gonna.
4830000	4835000	The other thing, too, you have to look at is a lot of people may have already had the guitar bundles for it already,
4835000	4843000	so maybe people just bought way too many bundles for their stores, and the game only versions are selling well.
4843000	4849000	Because, I mean, I could see that, especially if, you know, say you're in the Guitar Hero and you've had one through three already,
4849000	4854000	you probably already own a second guitar, you probably don't need a third guitar, so, maybe.
4854000	4859000	And Dark Tetsuya says the mandatory, uh, and Skye, how about Guitar Hero Journey?
4859000	4861000	Uh, you know I'm down with that. By the way,
4861000	4862000	Rob's not gonna stop believin'.
4862000	4866000	Did you hear, I'm not stopping believin', did you hear the Journey is going to be in town?
4866000	4867000	How are they?
4867000	4868000	With heart.
4868000	4869000	What?
4869000	4870000	And cheap trick.
4870000	4871000	When?
4871000	4872000	Like, soon.
4872000	4873000	We're going, right?
4873000	4876000	I don't know, it might be the same weekend as PAX, I have to look it up.
4876000	4877000	I'll find out.
4877000	4878000	I'll look it up.
4878000	4880000	I will be angry.
4880000	4882000	I'll look it up while we read a story.
4882000	4886000	Dude, if there's one thing better than Journey, it's heart and Journey.
4886000	4888000	It's heart.
4888000	4890000	I don't care, I don't care.
4890000	4893000	As long as I get my power ballads, I'm happy.
4893000	4895000	SHA100Matt says Guitar Hero Abba.
4895000	4898000	No, that's for my dream pop and music game.
4898000	4900000	That would be like Keyboard Mania.
4900000	4903000	Anyhow, sorry, let's move on.
4903000	4904000	Yeah, shall we?
4904000	4908000	The full Rock Revolution setlist was released this week.
4908000	4912000	You know, the Konami game we were teasing a little bit in Parday.
4912000	4913000	Yeah, I know.
4913000	4915000	Here's the thing, there's only 41 songs on it.
4915000	4918000	Apparently none of them are originals, at least that's what we've heard.
4918000	4920000	A spreadsheet went out earlier this week.
4920000	4922000	I guess it was actually leaked from the inside.
4922000	4924000	Now, here's the thing though.
4924000	4926000	It does have some kind of cool things on it.
4926000	4929000	Speaking of heart, Magic Man is in the game.
4929000	4931000	Which is kind of cool, right?
4931000	4933000	Okay, that means I have to get this game now.
4933000	4934000	Damn you!
4934000	4935000	Damn you, Konami!
4935000	4937000	It's a cover, it could be bad.
4937000	4938000	Don't care, she'll go have it.
4938000	4940000	But check this out.
4940000	4942000	Come on, Feel the Noise by Quiet Riot is in it.
4942000	4943000	Okay, that's cool.
4943000	4944000	That's kind of awesome too.
4944000	4945000	Mega Death is in it.
4945000	4946000	Which Mega Death?
4946000	4948000	Holy Wars, The Punishment Due.
4948000	4949000	Ooh.
4949000	4951000	Queen with Stone Cold Crazy.
4951000	4952000	I love that song.
4952000	4954000	We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister.
4954000	4956000	This is Butt Rock's version.
4956000	4957000	Kinda, in a way.
4957000	4959000	It has Blitzkrieg Bot by the Ramones.
4959000	4963000	That's the one they failed to famously on stage at E3.
4963000	4965000	Am I Evil?
4965000	4967000	Bad Reputation by Joan Jett.
4967000	4969000	And just to top it off for fun,
4969000	4971000	Sk8er Boi by Avril Lavigne.
4971000	4972000	There you go.
4972000	4975000	And Linkin Park, so it's not totally Butt Rock.
4975000	4976000	All the small things.
4976000	4978000	All of the slash wrist people.
4978000	4982000	To go back to the non-gaming related stuff we were talking about just earlier.
4982000	4983000	Sure.
4983000	4986000	Journey with Heart and Cheap Trick, you were close.
4986000	4990000	It is the 27th of September.
4990000	4991000	We're going.
4991000	4992000	We can go.
4992000	4993000	We're going.
4993000	4994000	We are down.
4994000	4996000	And it's at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.
4996000	4997000	Guess what else is?
4997000	4998000	What?
4998000	4999000	Mountain View?
4999000	5000000	No.
5000000	5001000	There's one in Cali.
5001000	5003000	There's one in Sac too.
5003000	5004000	Whatever they call it.
5004000	5005000	Sleep Train or Sac Valley.
5005000	5006000	They change the name of it every year.
5006000	5009000	But next month also is Weird Al.
5009000	5010000	That's pretty cool.
5010000	5011000	At the fair.
5011000	5013000	I've never seen Weird Al live before.
5013000	5014000	You're coming with us.
5014000	5016000	Maybe we should do OLR live at the Journey concert.
5016000	5017000	Let's do that.
5017000	5018000	Oh my god, that would be fantastic.
5018000	5019000	I don't know if it's possible.
5019000	5020000	We'll find a way.
5020000	5022000	We'll go record in the bathroom.
5022000	5024000	Concord Pavilion, the 24th.
5024000	5026000	I know they're coming to Sleep Train Amphitheater.
5026000	5027000	Look it up.
5027000	5028000	Look it up at the Sac Valley thing.
5028000	5029000	I'll look it up later.
5029000	5030000	So, can I do my story?
5030000	5032000	Yes, Jamie, just do your story and I will look up Journey and Heart.
5032000	5037000	So, they're not as, you know, didn't go through their massive 80s-tastic mode because Ozzy
5037000	5038000	always rocks.
5038000	5046000	But there is going to be Ozzy in Guitar Hero World Tour.
5046000	5050000	We actually have some tracks released today.
5050000	5055000	And the two Ozzy songs are going to be Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley.
5055000	5061000	Other tracks announced is Airborne, Too Much, Too Young, At the Drive-In, One-Armed Sister,
5061000	5067000	Scissor, sorry, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Weapon of Choice, Bob Seger, Hollywood Nights,

5073000	5079000	We also have Silver Sun Pickups, Lazy Eye, System of the Down, BYOB, Survivor, Eye of
5079000	5082000	the Tiger, Rob, Eye of the Tiger.
5082000	5085000	Sorry, I'm sitting here, it's September 26th.
5085000	5086000	We're going.
5086000	5087000	Friday.
5087000	5088000	Friday night.
5088000	5089000	We're going.
5089000	5090000	We're going, we're there.
5090000	5091000	That's the one in Wheatland, right?
5091000	5092000	Yeah.
5092000	5098000	It's called Stillborn and other tracks that were previously announced, just to repeat
5098000	5102000	those for the listeners, Billy Idol, Rebel Yell, which I'm like, hell yeah.
5102000	5106040	Blink 182, Dammit, Foo Fighters Everlong, which, you know, that's going to make Drew
5106040	5107700	all pee himself or something.
5107700	5109040	It makes me all pee myself.
5109040	5110040	I love that song.
5110040	5111040	Foo Fighters are pretty awesome.
5111040	5112040	So Jimmy Hendrix songs.
5112040	5113040	That makes me happy.
5113040	5117760	Purple Haze, the live version, Wind Cries Mary, Linkin Park, What Have I Done, Paramore
5117760	5122240	Misery Business, Sublime Santeria, I'm going to yawn so bad for that one.
5122240	5123240	I'm so over sublime.
5123240	5124240	Yeah.
5124240	5125240	It's really old blade.
5125240	5126800	The Doors, Love Me Two Times.
5126800	5127800	That's a good one.
5127800	5132720	The Eagles Hotel, California, and Van Halen, Hot for Teacher.
5132720	5133720	I'm sorry.
5133720	5137920	I'm not the biggest fan of the David Lee Roth era, but I love Hot for Teacher.
5137920	5140360	That was a good, that was a fun one.
5140360	5145280	I love When I Kissed the Teacher by Abba.
5145280	5146280	Nevermind.
5146280	5149120	You know, I've got, I've got a present for you from Ronma at my house.
5149120	5150120	What's that?
5150120	5151120	I have an Abba album.
5151120	5152120	Awesome.
5152120	5153120	Album.
5153120	5154120	Like old art and everything.
5154120	5155120	Yeah.
5155120	5157080	Maybe we can put that in the blank space on Justin TV.
5157080	5158760	And he got you a Bette Midler album.
5158760	5161840	I'm not as big on Bette Midler, but my mother is, so I'll go take that to her.
5161840	5163160	He got you Super Trooper.
5163160	5164160	Oh, awesome.
5164160	5165160	Anyway.
5165160	5166160	Sorry.
5166160	5167160	Yeah.
5167160	5168160	Orange Lounge, Abba-oh.
5168160	5171240	It's Abba Lounge Radio.
5171240	5173120	Loki save the show, please.
5173120	5179280	Since we were talking about Rock Band earlier, and I mentioned that we were going to be talking
5179280	5180280	about street dates.
5180280	5186280	Well, the street dates apparently were leaked out of some database somewhere.
5186280	5189120	The dates that they have- It wasn't you, was it?
5189120	5190120	It wasn't me.
5190120	5191120	God.
5191120	5193120	I don't do that sort of thing.
5193120	5194120	Anymore.
5194120	5195120	Shh.
5195120	5196120	Quiet you.
5196120	5201120	And he doesn't do it any less.
5201120	5202120	Ahaha.
5202120	5206480	So, according to this database, which I think- I want to say that it was Fred Meyer or something
5206480	5207480	like that.
5207480	5210360	Maybe it was Blockbuster.
5210360	5213560	Probably Blockbuster.
5213560	5219720	The 360 version they have coming out September 24th, the PS3 October 19th, and the Wii November
5219720	5223480	18th.
5223480	5226520	That is about half true.
5226520	5230960	Oh, really?
5230960	5233040	That's not entirely correct.
5233040	5238600	Is there a certain element of that that might be incorrect?
5238600	5241220	The dates for those systems are correct.
5241220	5244000	They just don't mention one thing.
5244000	5249760	In September, the game only version for Xbox 360 is coming out, and the accessories are
5249760	5251720	coming out by themselves.
5251720	5256360	The bundle's not coming out until the PS3 date, which is the same time the PS3 will
5256360	5258920	be getting the standalone and the bundle.
5258920	5259920	That actually makes sense.
5259920	5261120	Because they're rushing the game out.
5261120	5269360	And then the Wii version is coming out November 18th along with the PlayStation 2 version.
5269360	5270360	And now you know.
5270360	5272120	They were close, but you know.
5272120	5273120	Not close enough.
5273120	5276260	They're probably getting the game only version.
5276260	5278080	What about the achievements and trophies in the game?
5278080	5282740	Well, the achievements and trophies are going to be very similar to the last game.
5282740	5293040	They have trophies for playing 100% on a song on expert for guitars, drums, vocals, bass.
5293040	5295700	Also for doing a Flawless Guitar Solo.
5295700	5301200	They also have some for the band World Tour Mode, including one for reaching one million
5301200	5303880	fans.
5303880	5311920	They have some stuff for the actual drum trainer, including completing some different beats
5311920	5315100	and stuff like that.
5315100	5318480	And then of course they have some drum challenge achievements and stuff like that.
5318480	5320400	It looks very similar to the first game.
5320400	5324480	Hopefully now that Band Tour is supposed to be online playable, so I can play it with
5324480	5327720	friends of mine and not have to have everybody over, I'll actually be able to unlock some
5327720	5328720	of those achievements.
5328720	5329720	Yeah.
5329720	5331680	Because I don't have the full thing, so I've never got those achievements.
5331680	5335720	I'm counting on my friend who plays Rock Band a lot more than I do to play my copy and get
5335720	5336720	me the achievements.
5336720	5337720	I'll play it with you.
5337720	5340040	You should come over one day and we'll get all those achievements.
5340040	5341140	I need to get that kit.
5341140	5342640	I need to get that kick-ass drum set.
5342640	5344280	You just have to learn how to drum.
5344280	5345280	Exactly.
5345280	5346280	All right.
5346280	5349000	Well, onto a completely different note.
5349000	5352520	This has nothing to do with music games whatsoever, although you might say these two are making
5352520	5354240	music together.
5354240	5358240	This is from a post on these forums, MMORPG.com.
5358240	5363520	They're talking about the game Age of Conan and this user, I don't know if the user themselves
5363520	5364520	did it.
5364520	5367240	I don't think they did, but they're posting screenshots from the Age of Conan game where
5367240	5374120	apparently one of these players who plays a male character in the game had cybersex
5374120	5375240	with the GM.
5375240	5377760	There's no real way to say this.
5377760	5381680	And I was going to have Loki and I do the banter here back and forth, but somehow I
5381680	5383480	don't think I'm going to be able to get him to do it.
5383480	5385520	So let me just give you some of the quotes.
5385520	5386520	What?
5386520	5387520	Admit it.
5387520	5388520	It would be funny.
5388520	5390680	We could pretend we're having the chat and read the quotes.
5390680	5391680	Yeah.
5391680	5394200	I don't think we'll give the fanboys that kind of fodder.
5394200	5398560	Unfortunately, if we did that, who knows what PSA we would receive next week.
5398560	5399560	Well, okay.
5399560	5403480	They posted these screenshots here and apparently they were, they were cybering a little bit
5403480	5409560	with the GM and look, here's some of the quotes from here.
5409560	5413960	The player with dual wheeled barbarians though, I mean two, that's a bit difficult for me
5413960	5414960	to handle.
5414960	5420200	I'd rather stick with one big sword and the GM says, you like it rough, I take it.
5420200	5422160	The player says, be gentle.
5422160	5427800	The GM says, are you a real woman, lol, not crazy question, you would be surprised.
5427800	5431080	And the player says, yep, I just play a male character so guys don't flirt with me in game
5431080	5432720	like on wow.
5432720	5437680	And the GM says, I'm wearing panties, joke.
5437680	5440880	Then they get summoned to a special area where, look at this, there's a screenshot of the
5440880	5442880	GM that's completely naked.
5442880	5447000	Well, I mean, as naked as you can get in an MMO, only wearing undies and nothing else
5447000	5448000	there.
5448000	5450640	And the player's just kind of sitting down chilling or what have you.
5450640	5454160	And they're going on here.
5454160	5456720	The player says, whip out your massive sword.
5456720	5461520	And the GM says, rofl, lol, you like, and so on and so on.
5461520	5465840	Where does it get really bad here, towards the end it gets really bad.
5465840	5470000	The GM ends up saying, hmm, you are bad, what if I rip your panties off and fuck you hard
5470000	5472680	until I'm satisfied.
5472680	5478640	Wanna feel you get really, wait, this is of course cyber chat, so the grammar's all horrible.
5478640	5483600	Want to feel you get really wee so I can put it just ahead of my you know what, inside
5483600	5487440	you, and use my hand to slowly move it around before plunging it fully into you and making
5487440	5489000	you take it all.
5489000	5490000	Wow.
5490000	5492720	I mean, that's a GM in the game.
5492720	5497800	As you can probably imagine, this guy got canned, but here's the part that's kind of
5497800	5499680	irritating.
5499680	5501560	So the whole thing was a big joke.
5501560	5506120	The player then suddenly yells, this is Sparta.
5506120	5509360	You're so kinky, you just cybered with a dude.
5509360	5515280	And then the GM says, lol, why did you want this then, are you gay, are you serious, and
5515280	5517760	then the player says, serious about what?
5517760	5521680	I was joking about the fapping, but then I am indeed the dude.
5521680	5525560	And the GM says, lol, okay, glad I put my clothes back on.
5525560	5530600	And then the player says, yeah, probably a good idea, I have AIDS.
5530600	5538040	Like, you had me going here like at the lolsy factor, but then like this is the equivalent
5538040	5541360	of me getting up on stage and telling this like hilarious joke.
5541360	5545120	Like imagine I'm Ellen DeGeneres and I come out on stage and I'm really funny and everybody's
5545120	5549640	laughing and I'm making jokes at people's expenses and then at the very end of my show
5549640	5553680	I take my pants off and I poop live on stage.
5553680	5558280	Like that's kind of what happened here is that, you know, lol, you had to end it with
5558280	5561200	the haha gay AIDS joke.
5561200	5567080	Like you suck and it's not funny and, you know, this poor guy probably got fired over
5567080	5571500	what you did and posting all these things on the internet and if you wanted to be funny
5571500	5573560	that wasn't the way to go about doing it.
5573560	5578600	So you can suck it and you make me very angry and therefore we're going to do the FUs of
5578600	5579600	the week.
5579600	5581600	Oh, I'm sorry, do you have a comment, Dark Saga?
5581600	5582600	I did have a comment.
5582600	5583600	Oh, go ahead, sorry.
5583600	5589400	First of all though, that's a big pile of mutual stupidity so I don't feel sorry for
5589400	5590400	either of them.
5590400	5593920	The GM's no dumber than you are, my friend.
5593920	5597600	Not you, I know I'm looking at you but I mean the user.
5597600	5602880	The user first of all is an asshole and also pretty much dumb fuck for the little comment
5602880	5608760	at the end but the GM should have been a GM in the first place if, you know, they were
5608760	5614920	going to basically act inappropriately especially, and now if it's like a private server that's
5614920	5621440	one thing but if this is a public server where someone is technically as an employee for
5621440	5626280	said company, they are a representative of the company, they should know better.
5626280	5627280	Exactly.
5627280	5631720	Amaze Satsuma in chat says pooping on stage is still better than Carrot Top.
5631720	5632720	Yeah.
5632720	5637560	Look, you get my analogy, all right, even if you have to be a smart ass about it.
5637560	5642120	All right, now I'm still angsty, I still have enough residual angst, hopefully Dark
5642120	5655560	Saga does two to the FUs of the week.
5655560	5660880	My FU of the week goes towards a hormone, that's it.
5660880	5661880	Damn those hormones.
5661880	5662880	Loki.
5662880	5668120	All right, FU of the week goes to my high school reunion, the 10 year high school reunion.
5668120	5672520	What a complete fucking waste of time and money.
5672520	5677440	Just a note for all you people maybe still in high school and thinking, hey, you know,
5677440	5680200	10 years from now I can go see all my friends again.
5680200	5684400	Don't do it, seriously, I mean about 30 or 40 people show up and they're probably the
5684400	5688440	people that you weren't friends with anyways, just keep in touch with your friends.
5688440	5694560	Me and myself, I don't really have a whole lot of FUs of the week, I had a fairly decent
5694560	5695560	week.
5695560	5696560	Raph, if I kick you will you have an FU?
5696560	5701560	Yes I will, I will have an FU, FU to the ferret, it stinks.
5701560	5708600	No I know I had a bad, I FU to drama, believe it or not, because there has been drama recently
5708600	5710400	and it's no fun at all.
5710400	5711800	Drama's poopy.
5711800	5713040	Drama is poopy, drama is no fun.
5713040	5714560	Save the drama for your llama.
5714560	5716560	A gun is no fun.
5716560	5717560	Yes they are.
5717560	5719600	I have a character on WoW called Drama Llama.
5719600	5721800	Guns are lots of fun.
5721800	5724920	Unless, you know, guns are fun unless you're shooting people with guns, then they're not
5724920	5725920	fun.
5725920	5726920	Do you know?
5726920	5731040	But shooting cats with guns is hilarious, no I'm kidding, don't do that, it's not funny.
5731040	5733520	I believe in everyone should have a gun.
5733520	5736080	I'm serious.
5736080	5739280	I'm completely in the opposite, here we go in the political stuff again, because I don't
5739280	5740280	agree with you here.
5740280	5742640	I'm gonna say one thing about that, just to see what you think.
5742640	5745320	Promise me we can get back to gaming after that, alright.
5745320	5750440	Do you think that most people are good?
5750440	5751440	Most people.
5751440	5757720	If everybody had a gun, a concealed weapon, whether they carried it or not, do you think
5757720	5760560	that someone would be more likely to do a violent crime on someone who may or may not
5760560	5763240	be armed?
5763240	5765320	I don't want the responsibility that comes with a gun.
5765320	5767120	You don't have to have it, but a lot of people have it.
5767120	5770040	I don't trust the 1% of people who shouldn't have guns.
5770040	5773840	But do you think that 1% of the population is gonna be stupid enough to attack the rest
5773840	5775440	of the population who might be armed?
5775440	5776440	I don't know.
5776440	5777440	I don't know.
5777440	5778840	That's all I ever have to tell anyone to think about it.
5778840	5779840	It shouldn't have to come to that.
5779840	5780840	Alright.
5780840	5781840	I'm thinking.
5781840	5782840	Ow.
5782840	5785480	Oh, don't hurt yourself.
5785480	5787840	There's other people to hurt you for you.
5787840	5797960	Anyway, well you know one of my favorite games ever is a Hudson game called Star Prodia,
5797960	5798960	right?
5798960	5803600	And I hate that they're putting it out, they're naming it Prodior, because I'm just used to
5803600	5804600	it being Star Prodia.
5804600	5806960	But it's coming out on Virtual Console.
5806960	5813320	Hudson says it's going to be on the, I do believe, this Monday's release.
5813320	5814360	So that's pretty cool.
5814360	5816920	That is if they're true to their word.
5816920	5822080	Well, we didn't get East Book 1 and 2 when it was supposed to be out.
5822080	5826440	But Star Prodia and Break In are going to be on Virtual Console.
5826440	5829000	And I know I've mentioned this plenty of times before.
5829000	5834080	Star Prodia is a parody of Star Soldier.
5834080	5840680	And it's a game where you, basically, you can play as the Twinbee, or you can play as
5840680	5846320	Bomberman, or you can play as a flying PC Engine and shoot things with HuCards and CDs.
5846320	5848000	That is awesome.
5848000	5850160	Guns that shoot HuCards I approve of.
5850160	5851160	Hell yeah.
5851160	5852160	Okay.
5852160	5853160	But I'm done.
5853160	5854160	Cool.
5854160	5855840	Well, hopefully those games actually come out.
5855840	5860080	Because I've never played this Star Prodia game, and I always hear Dark Soccer rave about
5860080	5861080	it.
5861080	5864240	So I'm kind of curious to check it out someday.
5864240	5865240	Yeah.
5865240	5868720	Well, there's some other interesting things coming out.
5868720	5874160	These aren't exactly legitimate releases, but still something that's being worked on.
5874160	5878400	I think we talked about this a while back, but it was under a different name.
5878400	5884260	I believe last time it was Super Mario Brothers Fusion, which was a game that's fusing kind
5884260	5891280	of Super Mario Brothers with Halo, Metroid, Mega Man, in fact they had recreated Aquaman's
5891280	5892280	stage and stuff like that.
5892280	5896400	Well, now this whole thing has snowballed into one giant game, including a bunch of
5896400	5901240	other characters, and it's now called Mushroom Kingdom Fusion.
5901240	5903940	And it's got 12 playable characters now.
5903940	5910320	You can actually play as Arthur from Ghouls and Ghosts, you can play as Sonic, Tails,
5910320	5916560	Luigi, Wario, Kirby, Zelda, or I should say Link, Samus, etc.
5916560	5917560	Tingle?
5917560	5919040	No Tingle.
5919040	5920040	Fail.
5920040	5924520	But they have all sorts of game references in this, a bunch of different custom levels,
5924520	5927600	it's all fan-made, a bunch of different power-ups.
5927600	5929160	It's Fangasm the game.
5929160	5930160	It pretty much.
5930160	5937480	You can actually download the beta of this, which I still get to run on my PC because
5937480	5944480	it's very un, I don't know, they just haven't finished yet.
5944480	5947400	It's still in beta, it's not optimized yet.
5947400	5949480	Yeah, not optimized one bit.
5949480	5953520	But if you do get to run though, it is pretty awesome, they do have a beta you can check
5953520	5957520	out that includes a lot of the game that's already done right now.
5957520	5963440	Some of the more recent stuff they did, they have power-ups you can get, including, for
5963440	5967640	example, if you get the Mega Man power-up, if you're playing Mario, Mario becomes Mega
5967640	5975920	Mario, Luigi becomes Proto Luigi, Sonic becomes Quick Man, and Tails becomes Gyro Man Tails,
5975920	5976920	which is interesting.
5976920	5980240	Interesting is a good word for it.
5980240	5983880	And they have actually a website dedicated to it, a whole little wiki and stuff, including
5983880	5986720	all the games that they reference in it and have different levels.
5986720	5991220	There's some obscure shit in this, I mean, it's really cool though, and definitely worth
5991220	5992220	checking out.
5992220	6001680	If you want to check out the game, check out any information on it, the website is mkfusion.ipbfree.com.
6001680	6002680	Ipfreely.com?
6002680	6003680	What?
6003680	6004680	I.P.B.
6004680	6005680	I.P.B.
6005680	6006680	I.P.B.
6006680	6007680	Free.
6007680	6008680	I.P.B.
6008680	6009680	Free.
6009680	6010680	So.
6010680	6011680	Alright.
6011680	6012680	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
6012680	6015720	Huh, I'll have to check this game out when they fix some of their memory problems.
6015720	6019640	It sounds interesting, but it sounds like what would happen if the fans made Super Smash
6019640	6022640	Brothers, that's what would happen.
6022640	6026560	Hey, talk about legitimate games though, this one's legitimate and something the fanboys
6026560	6027560	definitely want.
6027560	6030680	Raiden 4 is going to be coming out for the Xbox 360.
6030680	6034360	That has been announced by Moss, who is the developer of Raiden 4.
6034360	6039400	They are porting the old arcade shoot-em-up to the Xbox 360, and apparently they're actually
6039400	6042960	going to put new aircrafts in the game through download content.
6042960	6045440	The game comes out September 11th in Japan.
6045440	6049480	The game soundtrack is supposed to be included with the game as well, so that's pretty cool.
6049480	6050480	Raiden 4.
6050480	6051480	You a Raiden 4 fan, DarkSakura?
6051480	6052480	I know you like your shoot-em-ups.
6052480	6057800	Actually, I was just having a discussion with Dan about Raiden Fighters, so yeah, I'm pretty
6057800	6058800	cool about that.
6058800	6059800	Awesome.
6059800	6062840	Alright, well we're really cool whenever we get emails from you guys.
6062840	6066320	You make us feel special when you email us at Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
6066320	6069680	Sadly, we feel kind of sucky this week, because not a lot of you guys emailed us, and we're
6069680	6074380	not feeling the love, and I'm going to go cry now, but DarkSakura will read those few
6074380	6080320	emails we did get this week, right now.
6080320	6089800	First email is from GS68, Hey OLR Crew, about the issue of Wii storage space, I'm not sure
6089800	6094400	if this has been brought up yet, but can't you put VC games on an SD card and then put
6094400	6097120	them back on your Wii when you want to play them again?
6097120	6098880	Is there something wrong with that?
6098880	6103160	Not saying you're dumbasses or anything, just wondering why you can't transfer your VC games
6103160	6106800	onto an SD card, does that take too long or is it too inconvenient?
6106800	6110360	PS, this email was brought to you by Justin TV, home of the never-ending spammers and
6110360	6111360	assholes.
6111360	6116080	Yes, on the it's too inconvenient part, it's a little silly that your Wii can read from
6116080	6120720	it, but yet it can't read data from it, and access ga- it's like not being able to run
6120720	6124800	a pi- imagine this, every time you wanted to look at pictures on a USB card, you had
6124800	6128440	to copy them to your computer to view them, you couldn't view them right off your USB
6128440	6131360	card, that's kind of annoying, you know what I mean?
6131360	6135000	That's kind of the analogy there, like it's just a little silly that the games won't run
6135000	6136000	off it.
6136000	6140040	I'll be honest, I didn't realize that you could save them on an SD card, I would actually
6140040	6145280	back them up that way myself, but the reason being is I would take the ones that after
6145280	6150820	I had played them for a while, those I would be- I would back up and set those aside, so
6150820	6155800	that if I wanted to play them, you know, later on, like you know like for example if I was
6155800	6160080	playing like a lot of Alien Crush, I wouldn't move Alien Crush off there, but if say I played
6160080	6165440	through you know, what's another one on there, Blaster Master, and was kind of tired of it?
6165440	6166720	Not yet, but someday.
6166720	6172040	I'm just picking, I think, arbitrary title, you know, so that would be the case that I
6172040	6180920	think that that could be okay, but if it's- if you're- but not in a- I just want to, you
6180920	6184160	know, do this every time with every game.
6184160	6187880	AlphaCananagram has a good point, he says, it just takes too long to copy back on the
6187880	6190040	Wii, especially Nintendo 64 games.
6190040	6191040	Oh, that's a good point.
6191040	6192040	Mm-hmm.
6192040	6198320	God, I wonder how- how those, um, uh, TurboGrafx CD games would be.
6198320	6199600	Don't know, don't know.
6199600	6203120	It's just a little silly, it's not supported yet, I don't know if the slot access is too
6203120	6206800	slow, but it's just- it's- it's the principle.
6206800	6208840	That's all.
6208840	6211240	Next email, this is from Saltek.
6211240	6216080	Hey, OLR, I just wanted to point out one thing the R4 has done for Nintendo.
6216080	6220360	Out of the five people I know who own DS's for them bought it only because of the R4,
6220360	6221360	myself included.
6221360	6227160	Nintendo is going to make money because the R4, um, because the R4 since they make money
6227160	6232880	on every DS sold, where it is really bad for the third party developers because people
6232880	6236840	will not be purchasing those games, which is unfortunate, but happens when devices like
6236840	6238520	this are released.
6238520	6242200	Keep up the great work and I apologize if my grammar sucks, but I'm very bad at writing,
6242200	6243200	Saltek.
6243200	6244560	That's okay, I forgive you.
6244560	6245660	This time.
6245660	6247580	To be honest, I think you're kind of in the minority though.
6247580	6250620	You and your friends are probably kind of a group of hackers, you know, in the sense
6250620	6255400	that you enjoy these types of things, you know, in the systems, that's part- you know,
6255400	6260520	you probably also bought a PSP so you could play NES games on it, I could be wrong, but
6260520	6266400	do realize you and your friends are not the mass gamer, if that makes sense.
6266400	6269520	But I don't- I'm not saying I disagree with you, I'm just saying, you know, you can't
6269520	6273920	say that four out of all five gamers only bought a DS for the R4, that's the thing.
6273920	6274920	That's the one point I'm trying to make.
6274920	6277960	But, you know, I don't think the R4 is a bad device when used appropriately.
6277960	6280600	I am all for breaking region locks.
6280600	6282120	I am all for that.
6282120	6287240	Well, the next and last email I should say, well, you know, I'm actually going to be kind
6287240	6291560	and check and see if there's one more email because I am kind.
6291560	6299200	And actually, we did get one, dun dun dun, but I'll read that next.
6299200	6305400	OLR, I was checking to see if OLR has any events or special guests for the 300th show
6305400	6309720	and if there's any room in the studio slash garage I would like to attend pending travel
6309720	6311680	arrangements slash work.
6311680	6315400	Here is some of the reasons which can earn me a spot in the studio as an attendee slash
6315400	6316400	guest.
6316400	6318360	This person's very fond of slashes.
6318360	6323280	Having met Dark Sakura, must meet Sky and Loki to complete meeting the trifecta of OLR
6323280	6324280	hosts.
6324280	6328680	Gave DMN a ride home 35 miles from the arcade, somehow triggering the random chain of events
6328680	6335480	which would include Dark Sakura paying for one of my games of DDR the following month.
6335480	6336960	I play DDR.
6336960	6341520	I am possibly, probably one of the oldest skilled DDR players, I've just turned 31 and
6341520	6344760	I can keep up with people nearly half my age.
6344760	6348440	This one, great seeing close pick on my summer love is an indication I might have to see
6348440	6352640	OLR live in order to AAA that song.
6352640	6355880	I have DDR player as my license plate on my car.
6355880	6358480	I must pay tribute to the fairy.
6358480	6365400	Those are just a few reasons to be there during the 300th show in some form or another, lol.
6365400	6368960	This email was brought to you by Olive Garden, home of the never ending Olive Garden insert
6368960	6373720	contextual question mark pound 78 dot track dot google dot com.
6373720	6375560	Peace out and AAA Jammer J.
6375560	6380000	I'm going to be honest, I haven't even thought about the 300th episode yet, it's still two
6380000	6381320	months off.
6381320	6384120	There's PAX kind of in the way.
6384120	6385560	It's going to be a little while.
6385560	6387960	Yeah I saw the pictures.
6387960	6392840	You my friend are a DDR fan if I ever see one.
6392840	6394120	I don't know.
6394120	6395120	It's a big question mark right now.
6395120	6396120	We'll see.
6396120	6397120	More to come.
6397120	6398120	What do you guys want us to do for our 300th episode?
6398120	6400460	Wow what a nice perfect attack on my summer love.
6400460	6402520	What do you guys want to see us do for our 300th episode?
6402520	6403520	I don't know.
6403520	6405360	I want pizza and beer and ice cream.
6405360	6406360	We'll see.
6406360	6410080	I want to go back real quick because I'm an idiot and I got called out on it in chat.
6410080	6413360	Game Guru says the DS has no region lock and duh I should know that.
6413360	6416920	I've seen the import games for sale right on the store shelves next to the American
6416920	6417920	games.
6417920	6419400	What the hell I was smoking.
6419400	6423020	I'll be honest I don't use the DS a lot for region locks.
6423020	6426400	It's more for the Playstation games where I'd like to get around it.
6426400	6430640	But I'm thinking duh I've played Owen Don on my DS I should know better.
6430640	6432120	But anyhow.
6432120	6436680	I have Owen Don on my DS I bought puppies from him.
6436680	6442660	So sorry anyway as far as the 300th episode to be to be determined don't know.
6442660	6445920	We're always welcoming of other people in the studio but you know just try to give us
6445920	6447240	a little advance warning.
6447240	6450960	Plus I would honestly you really want to come out here just for the show.
6450960	6455360	I mean if you're going to go to San Francisco and do some tourism around there cool but
6455360	6458120	it's not even worth it to fly out here just for our little thing.
6458120	6460400	You can call in on Skype.
6460400	6466040	I mean I'm not trying to you know just being honest we're not that exciting people.
6466040	6467040	We're simple people.
6467040	6470400	We're like Amish people right Dark Soccer with video games.
6470400	6474960	Are we are we video game-ish?
6474960	6476040	Video game Amish?
6476040	6477040	Video game Amish?
6477040	6478040	One more email.
6478040	6479040	There is something.
6479040	6480040	Someone snuck in.
6480040	6481040	Comments from chat.
6481040	6485360	Act Def says episode 300 should be on Mexico tequila tacos and more JV Mons and he is from
6485360	6489680	Mexico so we can he can try to lobby us to get there just like JV Mons doing episode
6489680	6492760	300 should be in New York City.
6492760	6495280	Frisbee says episode 300 should be in space.
6495280	6497120	Look I said things we can realistically do.
6497120	6501360	I think OLR in space is not going to happen.
6501360	6503080	Like the ring of that.
6503080	6504080	Nice.
6504080	6505080	OLR in space.
6505080	6507800	All right one more email.
6507800	6514880	Okay last one says hi folks since I just got an Xbox 360 Elite on August 2nd I have some
6514880	6518780	questions for you mainly directed at Rob since I know he has a 360 but Loki and Dark Soccer
6518780	6520320	can feel free to chime in too.
6520320	6523320	Oh well thank you so much for your permission.
6523320	6527480	I know it's nice that the listeners give you permission.
6527480	6531680	One for those in my situation where we both have the PS3 and a 360 is it worth getting
6531680	6537040	the same multi platform games over again if we already have the given game on one of the
6537040	6538040	consoles.
6538040	6541760	For example Call of Duty 4, Rock Band, etc.
6541760	6542760	Nah.
6542760	6543760	No.
6543760	6548440	If you must sell your other one back at least get some credit for it before you buy the
6548440	6550840	other one if you feel you must.
6550840	6554720	This is how some games try to milk money out of you though is by trying to entice you to
6554720	6558400	buy it again like Soul Calibur 4 the whole Vader Yoda thing.
6558400	6559400	Hello.
6559400	6564920	Although I liked your theory about buying that other game to get both unlocked.
6564920	6568040	It's very likely.
6568040	6569520	My simple answer is no.
6569520	6571720	I'll ask him.
6571720	6573960	Rarely is that type of thing worth it.
6573960	6574960	I can't think of a lot.
6574960	6578000	I mean sometimes the game might really have a lot extra when it comes out on the other
6578000	6581600	console like it sounds like Bioshock might have but even then I would want to sell my
6581600	6585800	Bioshock on 360 back if I'm going to get it on PlayStation 3 which is actually not something
6585800	6590200	I would do in the real world but you know at least do that.
6590200	6593280	Well moving right along to the next question.
6593280	6598040	If you could come up with a top 5 list of games for a 360 owner should have what games
6598040	6599040	would those be?
6599040	6603080	If you like you can have separate lists for disc based games, Xbox Live, arcade games.
6603080	6606680	I'm going to go ahead and tell you a few that I have.
6606680	6609320	First of all get Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
6609320	6611600	I love the hell out of that game.
6611600	6613480	And the second one's coming out too.
6613480	6615680	So it's lots of fun.
6615680	6618960	Dead Rising you can you know kill zombies with a lawn mower.
6618960	6622400	That's fun for five seconds.
6622400	6625400	Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live Arcade.
6625400	6626400	Uno.
6626400	6634840	God what else was it that we were playing?
6634840	6635840	My brain blanked.
6635840	6636840	That's right.
6636840	6637840	I'll jump in.
6637840	6639520	The Xbox Live Arcade as far as that goes.
6639520	6641200	I've played almost everything on there.
6641200	6646200	I would say Braid, Geometry Wars 2 which I know just both came out but they're both excellent
6646200	6648200	games.
6648200	6653800	Rez, Symphony of the Night if you don't already have access to it on PlayStation.
6653800	6659200	If you do go Luminous if you've never played it before and you haven't gotten it on any
6659200	6661320	other console like the PSP.
6661320	6667000	And yeah I would say something like Uno or go try something a little different like Catan
6667000	6669600	or Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride.
6669600	6671400	Try one of those games on for size.
6671400	6673680	But don't get Yaris.
6673680	6676160	Yeah don't get don't be enticed by it's free.
6676160	6678760	Same with Totem Ball.
6678760	6682840	Any contribution Loki?
6682840	6687640	I'm sorry I'm being distracted by people saying that I need to be in a Tingle suit for the
6687640	6688640	300th show.
6688640	6689640	Silly chat room.
6689640	6690640	That ain't happening.
6690640	6694800	Recommend five Xbox 360 games our new listener should pick up.
6694800	6695800	Or Xbox Live Arcade.
6695800	6696800	When are they picking up their 360?
6696800	6697800	They already did.
6697800	6698800	They already have it.
6698800	6699800	Okay.
6699800	6700800	Um.
6700800	6701800	Let's see.
6701800	6706320	I would do Earth Defense Force 2017.
6706320	6709760	Hey it's dirt cheap now seriously.
6709760	6711800	It's like five bucks or something.
6711800	6712800	Alright.
6712800	6713800	Alright.
6713800	6714800	Um.
6714800	6715800	Crackdown if you want.
6715800	6717320	I mean cause that's dirt cheap right now too.
6717320	6718800	The jumping game.
6718800	6719800	Um.
6719800	6721880	I would say the original Saints Row if you want.
6721880	6723600	I mean if you.
6723600	6725640	I guess that's also dirt cheap.
6725640	6730760	I agree with JVMon who's flooding Lost Odyssey if you're remotely interested in RPGs.
6730760	6731760	I guess.
6731760	6734520	There's a lot of RPGs coming out though pretty soon so.
6734520	6735520	Uh.
6735520	6738720	Lost Odyssey I guess.
6738720	6740400	Um.
6740400	6742980	Bioshock's good.
6742980	6744980	And probably.
6744980	6747460	OMG Halo 3.
6747460	6750460	Let's move on.
6750460	6751840	I would not recommend Halo 3.
6751840	6752840	Call D4.
6752840	6753840	Alright.
6753840	6755840	Is that.
6755840	6756840	No.
6756840	6757840	Alright.
6757840	6758840	More.
6758840	6759840	More.
6759840	6760840	Rob.
6760840	6761840	Anyway.
6761840	6762840	Moving forward.
6762840	6765320	Have you had any issues with any other players in Xbox Live?
6765320	6766960	People essentially being annoying or all around a-holes.
6766960	6767960	When don't I?
6767960	6769960	If so what's the best way to deal with that issue?
6769960	6770960	Don't play with strangers.
6770960	6771960	Ignore them.
6771960	6772960	Don't play with strangers.
6772960	6776880	Build up a friends list of good people and I urge you to start on orangeonshreddy.com
6776880	6781720	slash forums and if that's not enough for you go visit other forums that you like and
6781720	6785600	get other Xbox Live gamer tags and don't play with strangers play with friends.
6785600	6787340	That's the only way you're going to avoid idiocy.
6787340	6791320	Or make sure that you can play in a game where you make sure you start the game and you can
6791320	6792560	boot the players.
6792560	6793560	That's another good tip.
6793560	6794560	If you want to meet people.
6794560	6796680	That's actually a very good tip.
6796680	6799520	Also play games that idiots don't understand.
6799520	6802200	That's one reason I recommend Catan and Carcassonne.
6802200	6803200	Play games that idiots don't understand.
6803200	6806000	To laugh at the idiots instead of being offended by them.
6806000	6809880	We did that one time when we played a bunch of people in the UK at Grand Theft Auto IV
6809880	6813800	and we kicked the crap out of them and they were like spouting all these obscenities and
6813800	6814800	it was funny.
6814800	6815800	We were just like ahhh.
6815800	6816800	They're angry.
6816800	6818440	They're swearing with an accent.
6818440	6819440	Hahaha.
6819440	6820440	Exactly.
6820440	6822000	They're using words like you know.
6822000	6823000	Oh god.
6823000	6826720	I just have to say chat room remind at orange box.
6826720	6827720	None of us said orange box.
6827720	6828720	And we really should have.
6828720	6829720	Yeah.
6829720	6830720	You need portal.
6830720	6831720	Alright sorry go ahead.
6831720	6836640	But I was also going to say it just goes back to what was it I was saying a few weeks ago.
6836640	6839280	Learn to be offended.
6839280	6840280	I agree to an extent.
6840280	6841280	They're stupid.
6841280	6842280	There's so much idiocy on Xbox Live though.
6842280	6843360	There's so so much.
6843360	6844360	You get.
6844360	6845360	It gets old.
6845360	6846360	It's funny the first few times.
6846360	6847780	It gets so old.
6847780	6851320	I report every single one because I'm that guy.
6851320	6852320	No.
6852320	6853640	Last question on here.
6853640	6854640	Uh huh.
6854640	6858060	If you don't mind would you please send me a friends list to invite on Xbox Live.
6858060	6861760	My gamer tag is spazinator on PSN.
6861760	6863360	Minus the quotes obviously.
6863360	6864360	Okay.
6864360	6866560	What about Xbox Live?
6866560	6868040	This is the Xbox Live one.
6868040	6869040	Oh okay spazinator.
6869040	6870040	There you go.
6870040	6871040	Spazinator on PSN.
6871040	6875280	Um sadly my friends list is full and I probably won't ever remember but if you send me a message
6875280	6879000	asking nicely I'll boot somebody who hasn't been on in like 90 days.
6879000	6885720	I think mine is DarkSakuraLLR but I never use it because my husband we use his and he
6885720	6891640	I think he boots everybody I add out so so yeah if anyone has Dan's isn't his Gunstar
6891640	6892640	underscore hero.
6892640	6894640	Uh I don't remember to be honest.
6894640	6900120	Yeah Dan's is Gunstar hero and he um boots people that he doesn't recognize and so he's
6900120	6905800	booted some people that I added on there so if you add him and he boots you don't be offended
6905800	6907320	it's not me it's my husband.
6907320	6908320	Loki are you full yet?
6908320	6911200	No I think I'm like 70 something.
6911200	6912980	So Loki O-L-R right?
6912980	6914800	Loki space O-L-R all caps.
6914800	6915800	There you go.
6915800	6920800	Um thanks for uh taking the time to answer my questions as it's highly appreciated um
6920800	6921800	take care.
6921800	6924640	That's a really nice letter thank you.
6924640	6927720	I add everybody but you know don't expect me to play with you during the middle of the
6927720	6934600	day when I'm at work doing our two 15 minute multiplayer games we'll ignore your invites.
6934600	6937560	Yeah don't just because yeah that's another thing because this kind of happened lately
6937560	6941600	is that I I'm without fail I always get invited to games please don't be offended if I turn
6941600	6944800	them down but keep in mind sometimes when I turn on the Xbox I have a game in mind I
6944800	6948320	want to play I don't want to go back like I don't even know where my copy of Halo 3
6948320	6951800	is and like from several people I get Halo 3 invites please don't be offended when I
6951800	6953800	decline them I just don't that's not the game I feel like playing.
6953800	6957200	Yeah see I get Grand Theft Auto 4 invites when I'm not playing it and Nellie's playing
6957200	6962320	like Zuma or Bejeweled so you know but usually then I'll be smart and I'll make it look like
6962320	6963320	I'm offline so.
6963320	6964320	Nice.
6964320	6965320	You know.
6965320	6966320	I don't know.
6966320	6967320	Alright.
6967320	6971440	Uh but I do certain random things will happen like uh I got into a random Uno game the other
6971440	6974920	night with some All Games people and we had a we had a good time Bobby got in on it too
6974920	6975920	it was fun.
6975920	6979400	I'm going you know Grand Theft Auto games every now and then you know I just haven't
6979400	6980400	lately.
6980400	6981400	Right.
6981400	6983840	Like right now it's all about Braid right now and Geometry Wars which sadly are not
6983840	6988520	multiplayer so uh may if you catch me in a good mood I can do Soul Calibur 4 if you catch
6988520	6993160	me in a Soul Calibur mood anyhow sorry uh was that it for mailbag?
6993160	6994160	I think it was.
6994160	6995160	I just yeah.
6995160	7000240	Alright so send us more mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com SSG100Matt in chat says dear Microsoft expand
7000240	7001240	the friends list count.
7001240	7002240	K thanks.
7002240	7003240	I agree.
7003240	7004240	Uh Loki next story.

7073480	7080520	I just saved you about 3 hours or 2 hours or however long this damn ceremony goes.
7080520	7082880	JV Mon says Grand Theft Auto 4 kinda sucked.
7082880	7086120	He's in the minority but Niko is the best video game character in a long time.
7086120	7090080	It's not that Grand Theft Auto was like super duper awesome I mean cause it was pretty awesome
7090080	7096640	but Halo 3 wasn't that awesome let me put it that way I don't know it wasn't groundbreaking
7096640	7097640	I think.
7097640	7101240	Yeah Halo 3 wasn't quite the like the Halo 2 was.
7101240	7103240	Halo 3 new paint job.
7103240	7106660	I've mentioned this before and this is seriously like I know a lot of people call this the
7106660	7111600	cop out thing but there's a certain X factor the games need to be graded on a little bit.
7111600	7115840	You know like I said earlier like Space Giraffe kinda just was missing that uh the Tempest
7115840	7119440	2000 hat and it's hard to put your finger on what that is but it's like the X factor
7119440	7120440	you know what I mean?
7120440	7121440	Yeah.
7121440	7126960	And that's the same thing with Halo 3 it was just missing that something.
7126960	7133440	The most descriptive game review you'll ever get in your life uh anyhow chad.orangelandrater.com
7133440	7137920	if you want to comment on that uh meanwhile hey the long time chatters will love this
7137920	7142760	an Eye of Judgment tournament who knew that game was still going on actually apparently
7142760	7146820	it's got its fans they are actually going to be doing a world championships over the
7146820	7152760	playstation network on August 14th so uh get your playstation eyes hooked up and get ready
7152760	7158460	to go with your uh official booster packs cause I know you didn't copy cards or nothing.
7158460	7163720	It's pretty cool it's uh officially happening on the playstation network on August 14th.
7163720	7172120	You can actually duel uh the creator of Eye of Judgment from Japan Studio if you uh are
7172120	7173600	so lucky to in this game.
7173600	7176880	I don't know if they're actually doing like a tournament style thing or if this is one
7176880	7180360	of those hey why doesn't everybody play this game online at the same time so there's lots
7180360	7181360	of people playing.
7181360	7186580	I don't know exactly what it is but uh sounds like it could be interesting.
7186580	7191440	So there you have it play some Eye of Judgment on August 14th if you actually have it.
7191440	7197600	Well even so you've got more incentive to be able to uh play Eye of Judgment and this
7197600	7201760	is great news for Loki although it's probably not going to help at all.
7201760	7208240	The Circuit City has um Eye of Judgment and the playstation eye for uh $40.
7208240	7210880	It's on sale.
7210880	7213720	And Walmart has it for $30.
7213720	7219080	Well it's time to go buy those things off the shelves let's start moving them.
7219080	7221120	I think I might actually go pick up one.
7221120	7224560	There you go that's one in a million only $999,999 more to go.
7224560	7228120	If it's at Walmart for $30 hell yeah I'll get it just to have the webcam.
7228120	7232040	It's a good price for the uh playstation eye cause I think the playstation eye buy it sells
7232040	7233040	like $39.99.
7233040	7236880	Yeah that's actually really I even I would pick it up just because someday I'll probably
7236880	7237880	get a playstation through.
7237880	7240680	I might pick it up to burn it.
7240680	7245080	Well I'd pick it up to have the webcam cause you can use the webcam on your PC and it's
7245080	7246600	better than the webcam I have now.
7246600	7250480	I don't use my webcam for anything other than taking random pictures but you know.
7250480	7254360	The webcam we use for OLR's just in TV is an actual video camera at this point.
7254360	7255760	But we used to use an eye right?
7255760	7257280	We used to use an eyesight.
7257280	7258280	That was it.
7258280	7259280	That's what we used to use.
7259280	7260280	And then it broke cause I dropped it on the ground.
7260280	7262360	Before that we used to use an eye toy.
7262360	7268640	We did for a little while use an eye toy that oh man that was back in the day.
7268640	7270400	Good times.
7270400	7275880	So uh lots of Eye of Judgment news around aren't you excited Loki?
7275880	7278000	I was the one that posted the story so.
7278000	7279000	They're desperate.
7279000	7284440	I'm well aware of what's going on in the Eye of Judgment world or the lack thereof of what's
7284440	7287000	going on in the Eye of Judgment world.
7287000	7291280	Well something that's about as ridiculous as playing a card game over your PS3.
7291280	7294840	How about installing Windows Vista on your PS3?
7294840	7297440	Yeah well you can do it.
7297440	7299960	That doesn't really mean it's going to work well.
7299960	7306760	Basically the guy installed a version of Linux on his other partition of his hard drive.
7306760	7311560	And in Linux emulated Windows Vista.
7311560	7317400	And well it takes 25 minutes to boot and 5 minutes to access the start menu and about
7317400	7319200	12 minutes to open Notepad.
7319200	7321680	12 minutes to open Notepad?
7321680	7323520	12 minutes to open Notepad.
7323520	7325920	Power up the cell processor.
7325920	7326920	Wow.
7326920	7331960	No but seriously though I mean you're emulating an operating system within an operating system.
7331960	7333680	Within an operating system basically.
7333680	7336000	Misty says my thoughts exactly in chat.
7336000	7338640	She says ew it's bad enough on PC.
7338640	7347800	And to be honest Windows Vista just runs like that so you know really stick with Linux.
7347800	7348800	There you have it.
7348800	7349800	Or Minty.
7349800	7351800	I almost said Misty Linux.
7351800	7352800	I bet you'd be excited.
7352800	7353800	Or Minty Linux.
7353800	7358040	Well I don't know if you can install Minty Linux on a PS3.
7358040	7361420	I think it only takes Yellow Dog or something like that.
7361420	7362600	How about Misty Linux?
7362600	7365120	Would that be like a OLR based Linux system?
7365120	7366120	Misty Linux?
7366120	7367120	Misty Linux.
7367120	7368120	Instead of Minty Linux.
7368120	7369120	It's like emo Linux.
7369120	7370120	You know.
7370120	7371120	Oh my eyes are Misty.
7371120	7372120	No no.
7372120	7373560	Like our listener Misty.
7373560	7374560	Not like.
7374560	7375560	Oh forget it.
7375560	7376560	Yeah I know Misty.
7376560	7377560	Our listener.
7377560	7378560	Forget it.
7378560	7379560	I got that.
7379560	7380560	I understood that.
7380560	7381560	I was taking the joke further.
7381560	7383760	But she's Misty after the Pokemon girl with pigtails.
7383760	7386680	Remember back in the day?
7386680	7387680	Forget it.
7387680	7388680	Yeah back in the day when I played Pokemon.
7388680	7391880	Let me think back to that day.
7391880	7392880	It doesn't exist.
7392880	7396360	I hate you.
7396360	7397360	Just kidding.
7397360	7398360	Just kidding.
7398360	7401960	But I will like you a whole lot Loki if you get this for me.
7401960	7403440	It's Little Big Planet.
7403440	7405220	Of course you'd have to buy me a PS3 as well.
7405220	7407220	So get working on that.
7407220	7408220	Little Big Planet.
7408220	7412160	If you actually pre-order this game it was revealed by the official US PlayStation blog
7412160	7417440	that apparently there are five separate pre-order bonuses that you can get in North America.
7417440	7420360	It all depends on where you're going to reserve the game.
7420360	7425000	They haven't said where you reserve it will get you what prize just yet.
7425000	7428160	But one of them is a Kratos Sackboy.
7428160	7429800	That's Kratos from God of War.
7429800	7433520	This little Sackboy which is one of the ugliest fucking looking things I've ever seen in my
7433520	7434520	life.
7434520	7436600	I think you get all five if you pre-order.
7436600	7438800	But that's a lot though.
7438800	7442240	There's a Sackgirl for Nariko from Heavenly Sword.
7442240	7446780	There's Little Big Pouch, a burlap sack that can fit a...
7446780	7447780	That's awesome.
7447780	7449320	I'm going to pre-order a game and get a burlap sack.
7449320	7450320	That's rad.
7450320	7453880	A Little Big Sticker Book which is a sticker book.
7453880	7460080	And the official Little Big Planet Creator Guide by Brady Games, but only the mini guide.
7460080	7462400	It's the little guide for the little game.
7462400	7463720	So I wouldn't think you would get...
7463720	7465880	I think it's kind of cute.
7465880	7466880	That is ugly.
7466880	7467880	I bet the Nariko ones better.
7467880	7468880	Oh, I think it's cute.
7468880	7469880	To be honest...
7469880	7470880	It looks like a poop.
7470880	7471880	To be honest, I am nice.
7471880	7472880	No, it's good.
7472880	7474880	Your butt looks like a poop.
7474880	7476240	Well, thank you.
7476240	7479280	I'm not really too excited about the God of War and Heavenly Sword, so...
7479280	7481960	I was looking at the one for the Heavenly Sword one is actually...
7481960	7486200	Okay, the burlap sack is like a zipper pouch.
7486200	7487560	It's cute.
7487560	7491480	I would get the Little Big Pouch or the Nariko if it doesn't look as hideous as the Kratos
7491480	7492480	one.
7492480	7494280	Oh, so cute.
7494280	7495800	The Heavenly Sword one is really cute.
7495800	7496800	She looks like a Fraggle.
7496800	7497800	Well, you...
7497800	7500960	Now, Fraggles are rad.
7500960	7502800	Do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?
7502800	7504400	Dude, they should.
7504400	7509480	Loki, do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?
7509480	7511760	Maybe on like the ColecoVision or something like that.
7511760	7513720	Okay, they need a new Fraggle Rock game.
7513720	7518800	Well, you can wait for the remake of the Fraggle Rock, or especially a Fraggle Rock movie.
7518800	7523760	They're gonna do a remake, I guess, of it or something, and then there'll be a video
7523760	7526260	game coming out for it.
7526260	7528520	As long as it doesn't suck.
7528520	7529520	Right, DarkSakura?
7529520	7531580	If it sucks, then it sucks.
7531580	7534860	It's gonna be a remake of a series that a lot of people have forgotten about.
7534860	7536120	I'm sure it's gonna suck.
7536120	7539520	No one can forget about Fraggle Rock.
7539520	7540520	Not while I'm around.
7540520	7541520	Ever.
7541520	7542520	Ever.
7542520	7548320	Well, this is something that no one will ever be able to forget once they've heard of it,
7548320	7558760	is there's a shooter series that stars heavily-muscled men wearing Speedos, and it's called...
7558760	7564240	It's the Cho-Aniki games, and there is going to be a new Cho-Aniki game on PSP.
7564240	7567360	Now, that's a series that needs to make a comeback.
7567360	7573320	Zero Cho-Aniki, which is a remake of the original Cho-Aniki.
7573320	7576920	And it's funny, the screen capture that I'm looking at looks like they're fighting a very
7576920	7582640	muscular version of Jack, like Jack in the Box, you know, because he's got the pointy
7582640	7583640	nose and the eyes.
7583640	7584640	The big balloon head.
7584640	7585640	I know!
7585640	7590260	But he's like, uber muscled, and he's got like a little thingy over his, you know, pee-pee.
7590260	7593960	Did they wuss out on the subtle gay porn hints, though?
7593960	7596280	I don't think so at all.
7596280	7603120	But, you know what, I told my husband in no uncertain terms that I'm importing zero Cho-Aniki.
7603120	7605400	And you should also tell him that you're going to make him buy it.
7605400	7608160	I don't know, I told him.
7608160	7609160	Nice.
7609160	7615840	Also, my friend who introduced me to Linux Mint says no Mint on PS3 as of yet, sorry.
7615840	7616840	Darn.
7616840	7618440	I had to spread that on air.
7618440	7620280	Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.
7620280	7621280	That's alright.
7621280	7625920	Game Guru says, also, why, why Cho-Aniki, why?
7625920	7627520	Because Cho-Aniki is cool!
7627520	7631600	And Game Guru would also like to point out that the Fragglerock redo is coming from Jim
7631600	7632880	Hansen and Disney.
7632880	7633880	So hopefully that's a good sign.
7633880	7635840	It's coming from beyond the grave.
7635840	7636840	Exactly.
7636840	7638720	Thank God.
7638720	7644720	So there's a couple neat, I guess, mods that have come out for the PSP.
7644720	7652760	The first is actually someone that has basically put a cell phone inside of a PSP, where the
7652760	7654540	UMD drive goes.
7654540	7658080	And so now it's a PSP phone.
7658080	7660080	Awesome.
7660080	7661440	It kind of looks retarded.
7661440	7664840	But hey, it's a phone and it's a PSP.
7664840	7666240	Something a little bit more functional, though.
7666240	7669120	Is there anything this device can't do?
7669120	7674320	Something a little bit more functional, though, another modder has incorporated a touchscreen
7674320	7676040	to the PSP.
7676040	7679020	That a little bit better, I would say.
7679020	7683640	And that project now is called the Touchscreen Project for the PSP.
7683640	7691680	It's on a website called pspzproject.dcemu.co.uk.
7691680	7699640	Dude, DCEMU, I remember that site.
7699640	7700640	That was...
7700640	7703960	My Dreamcast got more action from that website than any game.
7703960	7704960	Exactly.
7704960	7708040	Remember, was it Feed a Fury?
7708040	7710000	Heck yeah.
7710000	7712280	So yeah, it's interesting.
7712280	7719160	Basically he's allowed it to, I guess, have better battery life somehow.
7719160	7722040	They've redesigned the control pad and some other crap.
7722040	7725920	And he's working on a keyboard application for it.
7725920	7727440	I don't know, I think that's pretty neat.
7727440	7733520	It would be kind of cool to have a touchscreen on the PSP, because for the love of God, typing
7733520	7735800	on that thing sucks.
7735800	7741400	Alright, so wow, we've had Wii hacks and now PSP hacks.
7741400	7745240	The hackers sure are busy.
7745240	7748160	We're going to end tonight, before we go to the Skype line, with a story that I know is
7748160	7751200	going to surprise you guys, it's going to knock the socks off of you.
7751200	7752720	You're never going to believe it.
7752720	7758600	But brace yourselves, Grand Theft Auto 4 is coming to the PC, y'all.
7758600	7759600	What?
7759600	7760780	Shock, huh?
7760780	7762840	I never would have guessed.
7762840	7763840	That is unheard of.
7763840	7767920	I never would have guessed, based on the 50 leaks that came out earlier.
7767920	7773360	Well, Rockstar finally admitting it, saying, quote, we are very excited to be releasing
7773360	7776000	the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4.
7776000	7780000	The whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the PC.
7780000	7784600	The game looks and plays beautifully on PC, and we can't wait for people to play it.
7784600	7789480	It is coming out November 18th in North America, November 21st in Europe.
7789480	7792520	There is a reason why this is following a story about hacking.
7792520	7793920	Oh, yeah.
7793920	7795800	That is all I'm going to say.
7795800	7798040	That is all I'm going to say.
7798040	7799040	Have fun.
7799040	7800760	Just in time for Christmas for the hacking community.
7800760	7801760	Oh, my god.
7801760	7802760	It's going to be so awesome.
7802760	7805960	The other thing, too, what's kind of cool about it, though, is they do have some expanded
7805960	7807940	multiplayer options in there as well.
7807940	7811700	No word on what that is exactly, but there are going to be some new multiplayer features.
7811700	7815240	Not that it would matter anyways, because people would add it anyways and recreate all
7815240	7817400	new cities and all sorts of mods.
7817400	7818400	I cannot wait.
7818400	7819400	Can't wait.
7819400	7820400	Awesome.
7820400	7824240	We're going to open up the Skype line now for your calls.
7824240	7827320	Orange Launch Radio is our username on Skype, or if you're feeling so inclined, you can
7827320	7828320	pick up the phone.
7828320	7832120	1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll-free number in the US and Canada.
7832120	7835360	Unfortunately, if you're overseas, you're going to want to stick to Skype.
7835360	7837080	We're not going to pay your phone bill, kids.
7837080	7841080	So 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, is Orange Launch Radio.
7841080	7842920	We're going to move into some last-minute stories.
7842920	7847000	I'll start tonight, and I'm not using a source or anything for this, but it's something when
7847000	7849860	I was listening to Bobby's show, I heard him mention it, and I realized we neglected to
7849860	7852560	put it on our own show roll.
7852560	7856400	Believe it or not, GameTap apparently has gone under.
7856400	7857400	Did you guys hear this?
7857400	7859400	GameTap actually went under this week.
7859400	7860400	Really?
7860400	7861400	Yeah.
7861400	7862400	Well, I got sold.
7862400	7863400	I'm sorry.
7863400	7866040	It didn't implode or go under.
7866040	7867040	It closed completely.
7867040	7868040	No, no, no.
7868040	7870520	It's being sold as a property out of Turner.
7870520	7874300	So sorry if I misrepresented that, which is good that apparently the stream went down
7874300	7876240	right at that moment that I said that.
7876240	7877240	Did it?
7877240	7878240	Yeah.
7878240	7879400	It's back up now, but we had a weird hiccup in the connection.
7879400	7881120	I was about like, oh.
7881120	7882960	But anyway, yeah, because the chat room is going crazy.
7882960	7886040	But anyway, oh shoot, Justin TV caught me saying it.
7886040	7887040	But yeah, no.
7887040	7890080	Turner sold it off, or is looking to sell it off apparently.
7890080	7893360	So we'll see.
7893360	7895240	Any other last-minute stories while we wait for some calls?
7895240	7899120	Again, since the stream went dead, 1877 GameoLR, the Skype line is open.
7899120	7900120	Or username on Skype.
7900120	7901120	You want to hear something funny?
7901120	7902120	What, Loki?
7902120	7905840	Okay, anyways, I was reading up a little bit more on that Mushroom Kingdom fusion.
7905840	7907160	They've got a bunch of different levels.
7907160	7911520	They have the Mushroom Kingdom, Alternate Earth, Mega Man's Realm, the Demon Realm,
7911520	7917680	which is based on Doom games, Genneta, Shoot Em Up's domain, Realm of the Nintendo, Sonic
7917680	7921200	Universe, Halo Ring World, Twisted Reality, and Minus World.
7921200	7927320	But in the Demon World, the boss is Loki.
7927320	7928480	How appropriate.
7928480	7929480	Let's go to the Skype line.
7929480	7930480	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7930480	7931480	Who's this?
7931480	7932480	It's the legend, Zaku.
7932480	7933480	What's up?
7933480	7934480	Hey, Zaku.
7934480	7935480	What's on your mind?
7935480	7936480	Long time, no talk.
7936480	7937480	Just random things.
7937480	7938480	Let me see.
7938480	7939480	The fact.
7939480	7944480	I'm just trying to find some stuff.
7944480	7950520	Yeah, that whole Mad Knight, which apparently is affecting me and others.
7950520	7952360	How does Mad Knight affect you?
7952360	7958120	Well, my, you know, my thugnificent little brother, who plays it out of spite of the
7958120	7963120	fact that he's all full of the whole hip hop thing, he just plays it because he knows how
7963120	7965080	to make money off of it.
7965080	7967920	How exactly do you make money off of Madden?
7967920	7970880	Through League, through League play.
7970880	7974840	Are you talking online currency, or are you talking about some type of shady, oh, okay.
7974840	7975840	Real money.
7975840	7976840	Real money through Madden.
7976840	7977840	Yes.
7977840	7978840	Through League.
7978840	7980320	He did that through NBA Live recently.
7980320	7986280	He and a bunch of other players basically did it through MLG and something like that.
7986280	7991560	I never realized there was this whole underground betting activity going on on Madden and video
7991560	7992560	games.
7992560	7993560	Oh, yeah.
7993560	7994560	It's what you think with Madden and all those others.
7994560	7996040	Is your brother making off this?
7996040	8001840	Well, actually, the team that he's in, he hasn't told me any specifics, but he did make
8001840	8005800	a lot, but most of the money is going to the team.
8005800	8009080	What does the team buy, shirts or a whole lot of pot?
8009080	8013880	No, just to pay off their players, I guess.
8013880	8018720	I don't get it, so then your brother is making money if he's paying off the players?
8018720	8024440	Well, he's actually in the League, so he's actually making money, you know, the earnings
8024440	8029360	are split pretty much amongst all the other players in his team.
8029360	8033280	So if I get good at Madden, which will never happen, if I get good at Madden, I could make
8033280	8036880	money off of it on this whole underground gambling circuit?
8036880	8038280	Yes, you could.
8038280	8040240	They do hold those things from what I hear.
8040240	8047560	They hold them and they pretty much hold the underground Madden sessions where they bet
8047560	8050880	big dollars for each game.
8050880	8051880	Underground Madden?
8051880	8056400	Is it like a rave where a bus comes to pick you up to take you to an unmarked building?
8056400	8062000	No, it's just at the private meetups, just like, you know, at people's houses where they
8062000	8067800	just like, you know, they play Madden for money, which is kind of, you know, I mean,
8067800	8072160	I can't imagine, you know, any other game, maybe DDR, unless, you know, you put money
8072160	8073160	on...
8073160	8075840	Well, I don't see an underground DDR betting circle starting anytime soon.
8075840	8080480	I mean, it could happen, think about it, you could basically put money on the number of
8080480	8086320	greats you get, you know, per song, like the less number of greats, you know...
8086320	8088920	If there's money to gamble, someone's going to gamble it.
8088920	8090720	We live in a risk-taking world, I suppose.
8090720	8095020	God, I don't know why I find this so fascinating, but I do, it's like, I want to see a documentary
8095020	8096020	done on this shit.
8096020	8099400	Uh, Zaku, okay, I'll try to get back on top of you, anything else you want to comment
8099400	8100400	on on tonight's show?
8100400	8101400	Any of the other stories?
8101400	8107160	Um, besides digital life being held next month, coinciding with an anime convention also being
8107160	8113120	held in the same place, that's pretty much it, you know, next month, digital life, $3,000.
8113120	8114640	What are you most looking forward to about digital life?
8114640	8117520	I know there was a little bit of disappointment all around last year, what are you looking
8117520	8120820	for them to most improve, what are you looking forward to this year?
8120820	8125480	I have no idea, I just want to, I don't know, if there's, if they have more, you know, they
8125480	8130080	have more like game, you know, game developers showing up instead of all this other like
8130080	8135760	marketing crap, I mean, besides all the schwag that you get for free, you know, you could
8135760	8140040	use a, could use a few more games, like in 06, which was really good, they had like the
8140040	8143360	Wii and everything, you know, before it came out.
8143360	8147080	Alright, alright, well, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but
8147080	8152040	thanks for calling in, and uh, um, good luck to your brother, hope he can make your family
8152040	8153040	a lot of money.
8153040	8156140	Yeah, I hope so too, maybe, I don't know.
8156140	8157140	Maybe you can ask for a loan.
8157140	8159140	Alright, take care, buddy.
8159140	8160640	Bye.
8160640	8164680	Get a loan out to get some of that DDR crack or something, that's, maybe, maybe if he wins
8164680	8167680	enough money, he can get a 2DX machine for the house, what do you think?
8167680	8168680	Sounds good, huh?
8168680	8171200	Would you, would you ever bet on a video game real money?
8171200	8177040	I'm like, I'm, I love gambling, but it ends at like slot machines, nickel size at the
8177040	8178040	casino.
8178040	8180320	Rob, I don't play the lottery.
8180320	8181320	Isn't it, but isn't it fascinating?
8181320	8185280	The only closest I've ever done to it is a lottery pool at work, where I was only out
8185280	8186280	$2.
8186280	8189760	Isn't that fascinating, though, that there's this whole like betting on Madden circuit?
8189760	8191160	I think it's freaking sad.
8191160	8192840	It is in a way, but it's, it's...
8192840	8195160	I don't think gambling is fun.
8195160	8201400	I don't like to give up money where I know it can go towards something useful.
8201400	8203320	Like one or two dollars, that's nothing.
8203320	8209960	I can, I'll every so often do like a dollar card at the gas station, but I wouldn't put
8209960	8213200	up anything more than $5.
8213200	8217360	For me, I, I'm willing to raise the stakes a little bit, like $20.
8217360	8219800	Most I think I've ever gambled in a night, it's like $60.
8219800	8223560	And I go, well, $60 is what I might spend on a video game or spend, you know, but I
8223560	8224560	always set a limit.
8224560	8227120	I don't take my ATM card into those places because it's dangerous.
8227120	8229900	You go in with a set amount of money and you don't expect to walk out with it.
8229900	8231400	And then you're okay.
8231400	8234280	Anyway, not that I should be endorsing gambling.
8234280	8238640	But once in a while, it's not gonna, it's okay.
8238640	8243160	You don't, you, people know their tolerance is the best for themselves.
8243160	8247040	So the Skylines are open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8247040	8250160	The username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio, while we wait to see if we get any more calls.
8250160	8252480	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us otherwise?
8252480	8254440	I'm still reading more of that wiki.
8254440	8258000	Actually, there's one thing here that's kind of funny.
8258000	8262160	On Machima.com, they have a video for, you know how they have all those meet the, you
8262160	8265880	know, classes of characters in Team Fortress 2?
8265880	8268240	Well, they have meet the cow.
8268240	8275080	I guess it's some cardboard cow or some wood cutout cow that's in Team Fortress 2 and it's
8275080	8276080	pretty funny.
8276080	8277080	All right.
8277080	8278080	We have another call.
8278080	8279080	Let's go to the phones.
8279080	8280080	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.
8280080	8281080	Who is this?
8281080	8284760	This is the one from Sweden.
8284760	8286600	Our Swedish friend.
8286600	8289920	I was hoping you'd call tonight with all the ABBA references we were making earlier in
8289920	8290920	the show.
8290920	8291920	No, I'm just, I'm...
8291920	8292920	What's that?
8292920	8297280	It wasn't about that, though, but, well, hell.
8297280	8298280	That's all right.
8298280	8299280	I'm just messing with you.
8299280	8300280	What's on your mind, buddy?
8300280	8306040	Well, I, well, the system specs for Age of Reckoning.
8306040	8308880	Warhammer has been, finally been released.
8308880	8313600	I don't know if you actually did mention it, but, well, it has been released.
8313600	8316400	Tell us a little bit about it.
8316400	8323840	The system specs for Warhammer Online has been released, which is a basic single core
8323840	8337160	Tenseum 4, 2.4, and mostly, like, a gig of RAM, if you run AXP or Vista, and if you're
8337160	8339640	running Vista, you need two.
8339640	8348000	Other than that, you need an average modern video card, and that's, you're ready to go.
8348000	8352080	That sounds like most anyone can run this, if you have a modern PC.
8352080	8353080	Yeah.
8353080	8364760	Since they're aiming for, aiming for, basically, the WoW, the WoW scale of players, even though
8364760	8374160	I'm quite a bit surprised, since, at least in my case, I'm running really on a, as current
8374160	8384920	state, unfortunately, a big, low generation 7 Geforce card, and that one isn't supported.
8384920	8396480	And the funny thing is that mostly low, mostly low ATI cards are supported, but the Nvidia
8396480	8397960	ones are not.
8397960	8402160	Here's the weird thing, you said that this game is out there, it's gonna be a potential
8402160	8406120	challenger to WoW as a lot of games have been claiming to be lately, but when your specs
8406120	8411960	are so high, you know, relatively high, I think, you know, the thing about WoW, it runs
8411960	8416400	on pretty crappy systems, and Max, where you don't even have a whole lot of games, WoW,
8416400	8420160	Blizzard's always been about having the games on both, so how much of a dent can they really
8420160	8421160	make?
8421160	8422160	Nah.
8422160	8425440	I don't know.
8425440	8429080	It'll take some people away, you know what, there'll be little bits and pieces that'll
8429080	8430360	take people away from WoW.
8430360	8440120	For instance, Dark Soccer and I both agree, the day Star Trek Online comes out, which
8440120	8444800	we saw some information about today, and we're watching the trailers, bye bye WoW, for a
8444800	8445800	little while at least.
8445800	8448800	But I'm not quitting Ragnarok.
8448800	8450280	All the cool kids are quitting their games.
8450280	8451800	I'm sorry, go ahead.
8451800	8461680	Pardon me, but I'm not that big a fan of Star Trek Geek, so I can't really say anything.
8461680	8470520	The only space science fiction MMO I played for a while was EVE Online, which, wow, is
8470520	8475040	sort of fun, even though, if you really ought to break it down on EVE, just on the EVE
8475040	8481880	front is Biff Gear's big Excel spreadsheet, so...
8481880	8482880	Awesome.
8482880	8486200	Bobby Blackwolf says in chat right now, I want to join Rob's fleet in Star Trek Online.
8486200	8488000	Dude, I'm gonna have a fleet.
8488000	8489000	That's gonna be great.
8489000	8492640	Anyway, I want to be Captain Sassy Pants.
8492640	8493640	Anyway.
8493640	8498800	It's gonna be awesome.
8498800	8500440	Captain Sassy Pants of the U.S.S.O.L.R.
8500440	8503080	Anyway, I'm sorry, we're getting off track, I know you didn't want to talk about Star
8503080	8504680	Trek because you're not that big a geek.
8504680	8507800	But go ahead.
8507800	8508800	Go ahead.
8508800	8509800	Finish your thought, because we're gonna get going.
8509800	8521380	Other than that, I've been, had the opportunity to try out Age of Conan, and, well, I'm not
8521380	8523920	that impressed, really.
8523920	8526560	You didn't cyber with anyone in the game, did you?
8526560	8528040	No, I didn't.
8528040	8529040	No, I didn't.
8529040	8530040	Good.
8530040	8531040	Good.
8531040	8532920	It sounds like you didn't think it was too high.
8532920	8534240	What did you not enjoy about it?
8534240	8536480	What turned you off?
8536480	8545120	It's really the combat system that it's, well, it's, we, ugh.
8545120	8551360	Or maybe just, I need to learn to play, really, but, well.
8551360	8555600	The combat system wasn't saved by the fact that you could lob people's heads off?
8555600	8562480	No, I didn't lob any heads off, I think, no.
8562480	8566760	But it might be also due to the following fact that I'm running, really, my computer
8566760	8574560	that I'm running Age of Conan on is really a lowest possible you can run on.
8574560	8578840	Out of curiosity, just to try and wrap things up, and I gotta wrap up the call, but, you
8578840	8582000	know, we talk about all these computer parts and high-end stuff.
8582000	8587040	You live in Sweden, and, you know, not that Sweden's like a third-world country by any
8587040	8588040	means.
8588040	8591080	I mean, obviously, it's a big part of, you know, the whole cluster of countries over
8591080	8595280	there on the other side of the pond, but do you get a lot of the high-end stuff as we
8595280	8596860	get it here?
8596860	8599640	Or do you find that you guys lag behind a little bit?
8599640	8602960	No, we don't lag behind at all.
8602960	8610240	It's just me that's not, that don't have the possibility to dish out to...
8610240	8615240	No, I know, we're poor here, too, I'm poor, but, well, I am gonna probably dish out the
8615240	8619080	money because I did a second job recently, but that's alright.
8619080	8629400	Yeah, well, if you have the opportunity, you can, it's really easy to dish out a few bucks,
8629400	8635040	so you can get a respectable gaming system, so it's no problem at all.
8635040	8636040	Alright.
8636040	8639200	Well, hey, we gotta let you go, buddy, we're running out of time, but thanks so much for
8639200	8641480	your call, as always, and letting us know how the weather is on the other side of the
8641480	8642480	pond.
8642480	8643480	Oh, well.
8643480	8644480	We appreciate it.
8644480	8645480	Take care, buddy.
8645480	8646480	Take care, buddy.
8646480	8649200	We're gonna go ahead and close up the Skype line and take any of the last minute stories
8649200	8651800	we have here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8651800	8654560	We have something else we're trying to get to live tonight, just for the live folks on
8654560	8658200	AllGames.com, so, anything else you guys have tonight?
8658200	8659720	I wish I could read German.
8659720	8662520	Why, is there a good German story in the works?
8662520	8667680	No, I'm finding out Linux install stuff, but the file I found was in German.
8667680	8670600	You're gonna become a Linux nerd by next week.
8670600	8674360	Loki, any other final thought, or, I'm sorry, any last minute stories?
8674360	8680160	No, but I finally got that Super Mario Kingdom, Mushroom Kingdom Fusion thing to run.
8680160	8683440	It takes about, like, 15 minutes to load, but it's supposedly worth it.
8683440	8684440	Jeez, Louise.
8684440	8685440	All right.
8685440	8688080	We're gonna do it, we're gonna wrap up the show, we're gonna go around and get everybody's
8688080	8689080	final thoughts.
8689080	8690640	So, Loki, we'll start with you, your final thought.
8690640	8692960	I can't wait to play this game.
8692960	8694360	DarkSakura, your final thought?
8694360	8699400	Dude, we are so going to see Journey, Heart, and Cheap Trick.
8699400	8701600	That's freaking awesome.
8701600	8710280	And my final thought is, I want to quote a Journey song, but not Don't Stop Believin'.
8710280	8712600	When the lights go down in the city.
8712600	8714120	When the lights go down.
8714120	8715120	All right, that'll work.
8715120	8716400	All right, have a good one, you guys.
8716400	8719500	Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Podcasting.
8719500	8722120	You know what, we wouldn't be here without your guys' support.
8722120	8726340	Again, all we ask if you like our show, tell a couple friends about the show, leave us
8726340	8729900	some positive reviews out there on the internet on your favorite podcasting website like iTunes
8729900	8731240	or Dig or what have you.
8731240	8735200	Help us spread the word because we're pretty stretched for resources here at Orange Launch
8735200	8736200	Radio.
8736200	8738160	Sadly, there will be no live show next week.
8738160	8740080	We're hoping to have something taped for you guys.
8740080	8744360	Stay tuned to OrangeLaunchRadio.com for the details and don't worry, if you're saddened
8744360	8749200	by the lack of shows here in August, PAX is going to more than make up for it because
8749200	8754600	we will be bringing you something not only every day ourselves, but we'll be bringing
8754600	8756640	you something with AllGames.com.
8756640	8759920	It is going to be just information freaking overload.
8759920	8763560	It's later this month, Labor Day weekend here on Orange Launch Radio.
8763560	8765680	Yay!
8765680	8766680	Have a good one, everybody.
