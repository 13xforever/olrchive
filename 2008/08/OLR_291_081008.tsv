13902	25372	Tonight, August 10th, 2008, Ozzy Osbourne gets ready to rock Guitar Hero, Sega admits to Sonic errors, and Grand Theft Auto 4 PC is announced to no one's surprise.
31721	33521	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
33581	36062	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36102	44004	We are that video game independent podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44064	45264	My name is Rob Roberts.
45344	47565	I'm one of the three hosts here on Orange Lounge Radio.
48345	54006	The other co-hosts with me as always say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
54306	54566	Yo.
54846	55887	How you doing, Jamie Summers?
56127	56628	A little warm.
57008	58929	Yeah, it is a little warm in the studio tonight.
59610	64073	Not terrible, thank God, compared to weeks past, but just a little... I'm having geek issues.
64613	65234	Geek issues?
65394	66835	Or geek drama?
66875	67795	What type of geek drama?
67815	82826	Well, no, I'm just trying to figure out, essentially, how to move over my ringtones and stuff from my laptop, iTunes, to my PC, so that I can start syncing my iPhone from my PC.
83450	86612	Oh, I thought, before the show, you were talking this whole thing about Linux.
86672	88513	I thought your geek issues had to do with Linux, not the phone.
88533	88913	Well, it does.
89093	99319	It does, because I've decided that instead of using my PC, putting another drive on my PC, I'm going to reformat my laptop to Linux Mint.
99820	100020	Nice.
100380	105243	So that I can play with it and not have to worry about the Frank and Vio going... Is it Minty Fresh?
106351	106831	You saw it.
107692	108252	It's pretty.
108312	108973	It looks fresh.
109693	110954	It's pretty and useful.
111234	114056	Remember when fresh was a word used to describe cool things?
114897	115617	That's fresh.
116198	116838	Crescent fresh.
118900	120601	Hey, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
120641	121602	How are you doing, Loki?
121922	122442	I'm doing fine.
122482	123243	Are you feeling fresh?
125123	127506	I was fresh until this fucking pizza dripped on me.
127726	128707	So now you're not so fresh?
128867	129127	No.
130349	134233	See, I think it's the curse for having white shorts.
134953	136355	Ah, it's inevitable.
137336	138557	It's a magnet for shit.
139218	140139	Seriously.
140640	146306	Everything's fine, all of a sudden a rogue drop of something will hit the shorts and...
147213	148134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
172309	183018	Also present, our always present fourth guest on the show, you in our chat room when you join us live on AllGamesRadio at AllGames.com when we tape Sunday nights right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific.
183258	187061	Although as of late, Bobby's been running over, eating up our time slot a little bit.
187141	189523	No, we forgive him because he always has us on at the end of the show anyway.
189944	193386	So you can always check that out on AllGamesRadio live on Sunday nights.
194557	198541	and SSJ100 Matt is quoting from Cifaloli.
198821	200943	Calls, calls, calls, calls from the public.
201564	216858	Anyway, we always love having our chatroom on board and the regulars and always some new faces so please feel free to stop by our chatroom chat.orangeloungeradio.com while we are taking live calls and during chat hours when we're taping live on Sunday nights.
218050	220052	No Phoenix Wright for reals.
243857	245318	I really wanted to get on a trial.
245798	247139	I really wanted to get on a trial.
247179	248179	It is fascinating stuff.
248219	249660	Everybody should do it at least once in their life.
249980	251121	I want to be civic-dutied.
251921	265229	Anyway, however, I do actually, I did sit down and start playing Oendon a little bit more, and I'm still playing Aurora Faint on my iPhone, which is crack-tastic.
265249	265969	That game is fun.
266769	269391	And Sudoku and Ragnarok.
270953	272834	Ragnarok Ragnarok Ragnarok
287561	291242	So is that so you can run your storefront in one window and so you can quest in the other?
291723	293623	Well, no, because I play on private servers.
293643	294984	All I have to do is auto trade.
295184	295664	Oh, I see.
295824	297245	And it'll vend while I am gone.
299185	306588	But no, it's just so that I really want something that runs a lot more efficiently.
306648	310850	I just need to make sure that my system is going to be okay with it for me to make the switch.
311610	330147	and right now I have to figure out because I've tried doing this before trying to get my iTunes my ringtones and contacts and everything to sync on my newer computer and so far iTunes said ah fuck it so as soon as I get that to work I can reinstall on my laptop and see how that goes
330543	333945	Well, I am considering upgrading the computer here in studio, actually.
334505	338667	I'm going to talk more about next week's plan in just a minute.
338887	346511	But since it's likely we're not going to be here with a show next week, I'm thinking about taking the time to upgrade the computer here in studio because I have my eyes on some quad-core systems and some fancy stuff.
347371	350813	Well, you can tell it's old because it's that off-white color.
351433	352974	Because all the computers nowadays are black.
353134	353975	Yeah, they're black now.
354555	355515	Black is the new off-white.
355655	356656	Exactly.
357957	358277	All right.
359989	360589	Anything else for you?
360609	363172	And it also doesn't have a window and excessive lights in it.
363612	365755	Anything else you want to share about your gaming week, DarkSakura?
366476	372642	My annoyments with my husband because he still hasn't got me The World Ends With You and he was supposed to and he didn't.
373783	374124	Liar.
375665	377908	I have it with me if you wish to play it during the break.
380804	381104	Okay.
382284	385586	Oh, and also there was a whole lot of GTA-ing going on in the house.
385766	387747	But you still won all to yourself.
387767	388607	The world ends with you.
388787	389247	Yes, I do.
389588	389868	For me.
390048	390268	For you.
390968	392489	To have.
392589	393209	Comments in chat.
393229	395230	Dreadlock Lord says, Sky, get an Alienware.
395290	397951	And SSJ100 Matt says, Alienware is overpriced.
397971	398871	Just build one from scratch.
399292	399792	Exactly.
399832	403994	I'm thinking of doing the scratch thing, but damn, there are some good deals in those package systems.
404834	405834	It's so tempting.
406315	406515	What?
406835	407175	Newegg.
408228	409349	I'm thinking about it.
409729	417293	I'm going to get so many nerdy emails from nerds everywhere that say I'm stupid, but I have my eye on a gateway.
417693	419494	It's really cheap, and it's really good.
421916	426939	I know this is radio, but I just got the look of shame twice.
427159	430581	Listen, I have a gateway laptop.
430801	432962	That's because you can't build a laptop from scratch.
433022	434103	And trust me, I looked.
434989	438270	I was going to build one from scratch, even if it's the ugliest piece of shit thing ever.
438790	439890	As long as I built it from scratch.
440250	444271	But no, I got this because it was an open box and it was just, price was right at the time.
445132	456354	Actually, I have a... One of my friends does a little bit of laptop tweaking and can build a Mac as long as it has the right hardware in it.
456774	457555	I got my iBook.
457575	458475	That's enough Mac for me.
458715	459155	For the house.
459655	462356	I'm actually, as soon as I get money set aside for it, I'm having him...
463736	466519	Help me with building a Mac from scratch.
466679	467740	What kind of hardware is required?
467780	468941	A Heen element for toast?
471203	471783	You know what?
472103	476167	I want a Mac because I deal with artsy stuff all the time and I need it.
476287	477068	So, shut up.
477248	477948	And I'll tell you what.
478249	481731	Having edited movies on PC and Mac now, it's so much easier on the Mac.
481932	483513	It is so much easier to edit movies on the Mac.
483913	484774	Anyhow, look.
484894	487096	Not every computer is meant for games.
487836	489357	Back to games for a minute.
489577	490877	Loki, how was your gaming week?
491037	491978	My gaming week was alright.
491998	493138	I didn't play too much.
494478	497039	I was trying to catch up with stuff that I meant to play.
498020	502541	This week I did check out Braid because I was like, hmm, I haven't made a random purchase online yet.
502801	503301	Random!
503361	503741	There you go.
504242	504662	Buy that.
506062	506962	So I bought it.
507743	508183	I think...
508834	512156	You know, because the big thing right now is that $15 is worth it.
512196	521743	I think everyone's kind of not really concerned whether this game's worth $15, but when these games that are $15 start selling, Microsoft goes, oh, so they'll pay $15.
522183	526406	Okay, we're going to make all of them $15, and now $20.
526526	527787	Oh, they'll pay $20.
527867	529948	We'll make them all $20, and now $25.
530168	531569	It's like the price of gasoline.
531849	533490	I was just saying something about this the other day.
533510	537733	You know how gas prices have been coming down lately, and it's about, like, what, $3.90 a gallon locally now?
538013	538654	And everybody's going,
538914	539635	Hooray!
539715	541676	Gas is under $4 a gallon, hooray!
541756	543817	And I'm like, that's what they want you to think.
543917	547840	They want you to think you're getting a good deal, but you've got to remember, a year ago, it was $2.90.
548300	550301	And even that was high.
550701	552242	So, don't buy into that.
552542	562769	Exactly, and that's what's going on with this, is I think the gamers are trying to tell Microsoft, hey, listen, we're going to buy this game, but we don't expect all these games to be $15, and we're not going to fucking buy all of them.
563089	564770	Now, all that being said, I think Braid is worth $15.
564850	566371	I would say it's worth $10.
568527	596293	but that's about it and the only reason because it it's quick I mean I know you said you had a little bit of problems with it because I'm stupid and it takes me a long time to figure out these puzzles I'm almost all the way through the game and it's only been about two hours and it's just I mean there's some of the puzzles later on are a little bit tricky but the first few ones I kind of figured out what they want me to do really quick and I kind of look back at this and like okay there's going to be speed runs you can do throughout the game um
597554	599556	But that's really the only replayability.
599596	602578	Quickly though, because I knew nothing about Braid.
602738	604580	Absolutely zilch about this game.
604640	608343	I think I might have heard it mentioned out of a game developers conference once or twice.
608643	614969	But about the game itself, I knew nothing about it except that it was supposedly this really critically acclaimed game until I got my hands on it this week.
615209	618992	So for those of our listeners who have no Xbox 360, what is this game all about?
619413	620894	I want to hear the Loki version of this.
621554	624357	It's about this dude who's going around and...
625984	629586	Being all emo about the fact that you lost somebody and you're searching for something.
629606	632347	And to be honest, it's like, text, text, text, I'm walking past it all.
632967	636309	But, yeah, thank God you can bypass the story.
637390	639070	No, but I read it.
639090	639691	I did.
640031	641211	I read it, okay?
641291	644073	But I was just like, okay.
645413	650696	My whole thing is, like, there's one of them that sounds like, you know, he had a wife or something, but now he's going after some other chick and
651544	655627	He left her to go find this old flame or princess or whatever.
655967	660890	And I'm thinking, you're just going to realize that you lost your wife because you're an idiot.
662311	670416	But at the same time, this guy is some crazy dude that's got a tie and walking through this world that's a ripoff of Super Mario Bros.
671537	674199	But the game is nothing like Super Mario Bros.
674219	674719	That's the thing, though.
674799	675059	I know.
675200	677101	But at the same time, it is...
678655	679015	I don't know.
679155	681997	It's got really cool, unique gameplay elements to it.
683158	687040	Portal could take notice of this, and maybe this would be perfect for Portal 2.
690424	690764	I don't know.
690864	699892	There are some things, though, that I did read that, you know, there's eight hidden stars in the game, which may unlock some more stuff later, which would be kind of cool.
701674	706598	But there's just... Once you're done with the game, I don't see it really going... I guess it's like Portal a little bit.
706658	707639	You know, you don't really go back.
708139	712042	But they built the speedrun thing into it, the speedrun contest, which I thought was kind of interesting.
712463	714544	Like, once you beat it once, you can go through and do the speedruns.
714564	716446	But I'm too stupid to beat it even once.
716766	718588	I mean, this game makes you feel like a dummy.
720380	722082	I don't know You're smart, you got more pieces than I do
749603	757254	Well, I'm also trying to be a completist, so I won't continue on until... Unless that last level, because I got pissed off with it, so I just ran all the way through.
757274	761640	Yeah, I just ran all the way through all the levels once, and then I went back and tried to beat them.
761941	763062	But, you know, um...
764093	764433	I don't know.
764453	766815	It would be cooler if it was longer.
767295	771779	Hopefully they'll have some download stuff later because that would be pretty cool for it.
772359	773300	Anyways, enough with Braid.
774281	782747	I also played this week the demo for Battle Fantasia which is like this weird medieval anime fighting game type thing.
784188	784649	It was okay.
784909	785249	I don't know.
785649	786490	I've heard about that game.
786530	788111	What do you think of it?
788491	788972	It's pretty.
789732	791654	It's all 3D and stuff but...
793177	793577	Thanks for watching!
818770	819090	Check it out.
820671	821591	Then Grand Theft Auto 4.
822251	824832	I also got my 360 back from Microsoft being repaired.
824872	828213	It was actually really quick, which I was surprised.
829473	830373	So that went pretty well.
830633	835355	I kept the old box just in case another one dies because so far a track record's been like 5 out of 6.
836815	838276	Or 7 if you include the new one I bought.
839836	842257	So... Yeah.
842917	843317	That's about it.
843357	845838	I'm looking... Definitely looking forward this week for...
847325	848086	by Commando.
848266	849526	Or is that this week?
849566	850087	That's this week.
850287	851327	Oh, that should be fun.
852168	856870	Xbox did a good thing with this whole Xbox Live Arcade for August.
856910	863554	Between Geometry Wars 2 last week, which I'm still playing, and Braid this week, I'm busy.
864094	865535	I've barely been touching Soul Calibur.
865555	869958	I think the only time I played Soul Calibur at all this week was when one of the listeners wanted to do some fightin'.
870638	871058	Which I did.
871699	878081	Yeah, I didn't get to play a lot this week because I was actually... I'm sorry, I felt bad because another listener wanted to battle me and I was too into Braid.
878242	882163	I just ignored all the messages that were popping up and I'm like, oh, I should go look at them.
882343	885385	Oh, the poor guy wants to play, he's so clever, and here I am all sucked into Braid.
885705	892408	I don't know, it was just this week I didn't get to play a lot because I was doing some video editing for something I'm making for work.
893108	895930	And I also didn't get to work on the PSP website at all, but...
897415	898016	Thanks for watching!
915080	916441	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
936391	938633	Dark Knight, Dark Knight, Dark Knight
960632	961313	Don't get me wrong.
961393	962574	I'm not bashing the Dark Knight.
962674	963294	Great movie.
963555	967558	But why is it okay to spend $30 there, but yet $15 feels like such a ripoff?
968739	970000	Because it's apples and oranges.
970060	970801	I get what you're saying.
970941	974665	I completely understand what you're saying about the whole you don't want to set a precedent for Microsoft.
974905	979169	Because especially the fact that, okay, then there's games like Fusion Frenzy 2 that cost, what, $50?
979789	981311	That entertain me for 30 seconds.
981331	983593	You're out of time for the logo to get on and off the screen.
983613	983693	Okay.
984233	985313	It's a retarded argument.
985353	988714	I understand what Penny Arcade was trying to say, but it's fucking a retarded argument.
989574	991654	Oh, well, let's go to Disneyland, because you can spend a day there.
991694	993315	That's about eight hours, and you spend $100.
993375	998416	So let's charge $100 for every fucking online game, because it's over eight hours of entertainment.
998456	999156	That's retarded.
999216	1008997	However, however, however, I can absolutely disprove that there's any validity to that argument, because going to Disneyland is like paying for 30 MMOs.
1009437	1011138	And going to Disneyland has Space Mountain.
1011218	1011698	End of story.
1012738	1014019	End of argument.
1014079	1014980	California Screamin'.
1015420	1015901	Alright, fine.
1015941	1018162	You pay $50 for console games.
1018282	1020344	Why can't you pay $50 for this online game?
1020964	1027029	I know it's only 6 hours long or 8 hours long, but some console games, because they suck, are only 8 hours long as well.
1028257	1029258	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1048340	1054507	Has anybody, a quick, quick poll in chat, folks, chat.orange.radio.com, did anyone drop $10 on that crossword game?
1054828	1055508	That's what I want to know.
1055749	1057531	Did you really need the achievement points that bad?
1057591	1062837	Don't be shy, this is a real needy survey, because I want to know if anyone dropped $10 on that game.
1063337	1066279	Now... Because it wasn't worth it and it sends a message.
1066419	1070121	And I do give them props for having demos for this stuff, which is nice.
1070281	1077225	That's what they really need to do because there's some companies, Nintendo, that don't put demos for their games up there.
1077525	1079867	And so you buy it and you're like, wow, this sucks.
1081388	1082268	Can I get my money back?
1082648	1082889	No?
1083229	1084410	Oh, well, fuck you.
1084510	1085370	I'm not buying it anymore.
1086351	1087772	I don't know.
1087832	1088132	It's just...
1089733	1097500	Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about it because games like this are going to sell well and they're going to say, hey, people are going to be willing to pay this kind of money, so let's raise the price.
1097801	1105788	Oh, well, we'll just use the excuse that my game's small and I'm an independent publisher and if you don't buy my game at $15, I don't make any money.
1106228	1112814	Or, you know, oh, development costs are going up more and we need more money for this stuff.
1114256	1114896	Dude, I mean...
1116024	1117646	Development costs for a game?
1117746	1118126	No offense.
1118366	1119287	The art style is awesome.
1119307	1120248	The engine is pretty cool.
1120488	1121389	I'm sure that took some time.
1122650	1126053	But seriously, they're Goombas.
1127155	1128216	They're piranha plants.
1128236	1129357	There's so much more to it than that.
1130177	1131238	We're just going to have to disagree.
1131278	1133160	That happens sometimes when you have three people on a show.
1133380	1135402	I say it's worth it and go spend the money right now.
1135502	1136303	Nintendo will sue.
1136383	1136703	I think it's...
1138803	1139963	Nintendo has nothing to sue over.
1139984	1143725	The game is an homage to Mario Bros.
1143805	1146566	and Donkey Kong and other games.
1146666	1150568	In fact, did you notice that the Donkey Kong level was called Jumpman?
1151008	1153749	Which is Mario's name in Donkey Kong.
1153769	1154750	What about stories, right?
1158532	1161356	DarkSakura, you really need to check out Braid.
1161757	1162398	You really do.
1162458	1170031	I planned on it and actually I added Major Nelson to my Twitter and so he put up a download code up for it.
1170578	1171078	Did you get it?
1171278	1171759	No, I didn't.
1171779	1172239	I was at work.
1172459	1173760	Oh, then somebody else did.
1173840	1180803	But I'm just saying, you know, if anyone wants to check out some of these games, you know, for free as they come up, he's doing crap like this all the time on Twitter.
1180943	1182004	Just pray you're first.
1182444	1183204	Seriously.
1183324	1183585	All right.
1184385	1185686	Results of our quick poll in chat.
1185706	1187146	Did anyone buy the crosswords game?
1187546	1188587	No, no, nope.
1188727	1188987	What?
1189167	1189768	Hell no.
1189928	1190428	No, no.
1190508	1191949	I didn't even know there was a crossword game.
1191989	1192689	Flash games, anyone?
1193089	1193309	Nope.
1193569	1194090	Hell no.
1194430	1194710	No.
1195510	1195991	And so on.
1196391	1197912	So I didn't see anyone say yes.
1198752	1200154	Oh, just kind of throwing that out there.
1200174	1206483	Alright, the rest of my gaming week, Geometry Wars 2, WoW, Soul Calibur, pretty much nothing else new besides Braid.
1207524	1210969	But that's okay, because Braid was a worthwhile expenditure this week.
1211409	1213212	Okay, that's it for my gaming week.
1213232	1215034	Let's get into tonight's housekeeping.
1216250	1219552	My Vegas trip I talked about last week got canceled due to personal reasons.
1219632	1220172	Nothing bad.
1220232	1222393	It just didn't end up being able to do it.
1223753	1230757	But we're still, because some of us kind of banked on there not being a show next week, we may still not be here, especially because...
1231917	1232517	Thanks for watching!
1247367	1248128	and DarkSakura.com.
1266721	1269403	The other housekeeping thing I wanted to say, iTunes reviews.
1289089	1291850	Please be so kind to leave us a five-star review on iTunes.
1291890	1292951	Just search for Orange Launch Radio.
1292991	1293791	Leave us a nice review.
1294071	1298193	I'll be posting the link in chat shortly if you guys would be so kind to post some reviews.
1298594	1300134	We would heart that very muchly.
1301135	1304316	It helps because the more positive reviews, it helps the ranking.
1304356	1306557	The higher the ranking, the more likely people are to find us.
1306977	1317022	And, you know, nothing against the shows that are all top-rated, but 80% of them are commercial, like G4, 1UP, GameSpot-style casts that don't need that attention.
1317022	1317643	What did Quiltipo say?
1317703	1318263	Waterboarding.
1341738	1342419	What the hell is that?
1342759	1345781	I have no idea, but I'm just saying... It sounds deadly.
1345841	1347422	We endorse thinking for yourself.
1347663	1354188	Waterboarding is where you pour water over someone's face when you're interrogating them and it gives them the sensation of drowning.
1354608	1358091	And apparently there's some big controversy going on in the government because they do that too.
1359012	1359752	Oh, okay.
1359792	1360253	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1360273	1362754	I do remember reading a politically oriented story on that now.
1362935	1369460	However, what we endorse is thinking for yourself and acting responsibly within the confines of your own concept of morality.
1370440	1370821	Does that work?
1371881	1372581	Okay, do that.
1372801	1373101	Alright.
1374282	1374803	Let's move on.
1375603	1379767	Hold on, we have to pause the show.
1379787	1380668	We hear an ice cream truck.
1381008	1381648	Alright, Loki.
1382149	1384090	The ice cream man does not have that kind of base.
1384711	1385271	I'm sorry.
1386152	1387233	It's the gangsta.
1388754	1389895	Ice cream man.
1389915	1391176	If I had an ice cream truck, you know.
1392057	1393578	Loki, gaming news.
1393678	1394378	Let's get to it.
1394619	1398362	If you are an attractive person looking for a cool game, well...
1399036	1399716	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1426434	1429977	Mace Suma says, so in other words, OLR supports torture?
1430558	1430718	No.
1432360	1437604	We just support people thinking for themselves and doing whatever they feel is morally and ethically correct.
1437724	1442509	Well, some of these past episodes that we've done, well... Anyhow, Strong Bad.
1442829	1444551	Are you excited about the Strong Bad game?
1444751	1447393	No, I never was one into Homestar Runner.
1447573	1448354	Alright, then screw you.
1448394	1450176	DarkSakura, I know you like Homestar Runner.
1450196	1451277	Are you going to check out the game?
1451837	1452378	Hell yeah!
1454143	1455524	I'm a cool and attractive person.
1455725	1457386	Are you going to download it on PC, Rob?
1457726	1461469	Yes, I will check it out on PC since I'm having issues.
1461609	1466072	Which is a bummer because somebody I know is... I don't know how much I should say.
1466532	1468154	I should be getting the Wii one, but I'm not.
1468174	1469054	I'm going to get the PC one.
1469735	1471296	I'm still supporting it one way or the other.
1471556	1472337	I get to revisit.
1472597	1472977	Here's the thing.
1473217	1475959	I haven't even watched Homestar Runner in like two years.
1475999	1478081	It's kind of one of those, oh, it's revisiting an old friend.
1479282	1480162	That's my plan.
1480243	1481804	I demand an Ask a Ninja game.
1483018	1484779	You'll never... We'll see, we'll see.
1485019	1485420	Someday.
1485700	1486000	Alright.
1487001	1487481	So there it is.
1488342	1489202	Check that out next week.
1489723	1491864	Meanwhile, or Monday even, you don't even have to wait a week.
1492425	1499810	Meanwhile, also on the Wii, Rock Band 2, and apparently they are saying that Rock Band 2 is not going to hold back on any of the features that you know from the other Rock Band games.
1500150	1501851	Meaning, like, download content.
1501931	1504193	Hello, that's something the first Rock Band was sorely missing.
1504213	1507675	They had to put the bonus songs on the disc and call it like a bonus exclusive.
1508015	1508636	Apparently...
1509316	1528623	uh you're going to be able to download songs do the whole online thing make your own rocker drummer whatever uh apparently this is coming from Wired Magazine Wired is saying that the Wii version of Rock Band 2 is going to be and this is right out of Harmonix's mouth fully featured DLC online play it's going to be a much more competitive product
1528783	1530104	Do they know something we don't?
1530184	1530824	I know, exactly.
1530864	1535946	I'm kind of curious to see what magical little thing is going to be implemented between now and whenever this game comes out.
1535966	1536267	Yeah.
1537387	1539448	So, very interesting.
1540348	1544250	But good news for Wii owners, especially those that want to have Rock Band.
1544270	1553174	If you didn't pony up the money for an Xbox or PlayStation 3 and this is all you got in your house and you want to experience Rock Band, I'm glad to hear finally you won't be...
1554515	1556056	Thank you for watching!
1577248	1578089	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1603342	1603782	Games!
1604022	1605023	DarkSakura games!
1605403	1609526	Alright, well, Mega Man 9, as we know, is going to be nestastic.
1610086	1613608	However, you've got an option to make it even more nestastic.
1614089	1615169	You can make it flicker!
1615870	1616330	That's right.
1616750	1617411	Real flicker.
1618551	1622133	As a built-in bug in the game, if you so choose to activate it.
1622854	1629538	So, for anyone who is so young that they don't know what flicker is, this is a good way to discover what we grew up with.
1630427	1638457	This is awesome too because companies like EA and Ubisoft and stuff like that tend to release games that have a few glitches in it.
1638577	1639338	Oh, don't worry!
1640280	1642262	It was intentional for your save to get deleted.
1643323	1644024	It's retro.
1644864	1645745	You like retro.
1645845	1649388	Well, in this case, you can select if you want it on or off.
1650188	1656253	But it's also saying that there's going to be other types of glitches that you would commonly find.
1656754	1663739	Because, you know, I found the glitch in Mega Man 3 by myself where you can kill yourself.
1664200	1673807	You jump down a hole and then you hold the left and right button so that you do the super jump and you lose all of your life and you can't shoot anything but you can still use your weapons.
1674788	1675808	and you're invincible.
1676749	1677369	Because you're dead.
1677729	1678729	You're undead Mega Man.
1679830	1682390	I have to say this from chat because this kind of goes along with the story.
1682670	1684991	Actdeft says Mega Man 9 will have flickers and bugs.
1685071	1685851	Yay for NES.
1686231	1689532	Why is this exciting news that we're going to have bugs in the game?
1689552	1691653	Well, granted they're optional but why is this exciting?
1691673	1701376	It's something that you can pick because the whole purpose of the game is to have the experience of playing one of the old 8-bit versions of a Mega Man game.
1701696	1708982	Which technically that's what it is, and if you want to have it the way the other ones were, you can have it the way the other ones were if you want to.
1709502	1712404	Why complain about something that you can turn on or off?
1712925	1714826	That earns you the STFU award.
1714906	1715687	Thank you very much.
1715707	1716267	Drive-thru, please.
1716367	1719930	It's not really so much that, but the fact that it's like, OMG, news!
1720430	1721311	You know what I mean?
1721591	1722932	I think it is newsworthy.
1723613	1724333	It's interesting.
1724373	1724954	I'll give it that.
1725014	1729877	I think that it's basically everyone's excited about the attention to details like that.
1731366	1731886	I could see that.
1732086	1732667	I could give it that.
1734128	1737532	I still say... Fine.
1738353	1738773	That's what I say.
1738833	1739474	So noted.
1740775	1746101	Well, put that on the OLR wiki, please, that DarkSakura's official statement on this episode is...
1748069	1757954	Well, one series that's been known for a few glitches at least, in fact a glitch-themed musical number that was released on the internet, Saints Row.
1758054	1762897	Well, Saints Row 2 will not be coming to the Wii, which is not surprising.
1763277	1773802	Basically, the concerns are over controversy that a game like that may cause, and also the fact that the graphics on the Wii aren't exactly what they are on the Xbox 360.
1775483	1788732	They basically are worried that because if you had weak controls for like chainsaws and satchel charges and stuff like that in the game that you may risk running into an adults only raiding kind of like Manhunt 2 did.
1790762	1819806	but I think that's stupid that they think that scene is there's been games out there that have had similar things already and been released mature and have done pretty well like Scarface or The Godfather or I don't know No More Heroes or Mad World that's coming out so I guess we'll just leave it to graphics I was going to say isn't this game just I mean controversy aside isn't this game just kind of too much graphically for the Wii?
1820868	1821068	Yeah.
1822969	1825309	That's it then, right?
1825409	1826690	Why play the controversy card?
1826850	1827270	I don't know.
1827310	1830911	Wouldn't people just accept the fact that the Wii can't handle it, period?
1831251	1831611	I guess.
1831811	1832491	And you know what?
1832511	1832731	It's weird.
1832751	1845015	I mean, what they need to do is have... It's going to take people releasing a big-name game, like another Grand Theft Auto that's on the Wii, before companies decide, hey, the Wii's viable for that kind of game.
1845035	1845835	Because right now...
1847023	1857548	Even though there has been some mature games on there and they're starting to get a little bit more adult content, it's still perceived as a kid's system, just like the GameCube was.
1858028	1860710	They're really having trouble getting past that stigmata.
1860770	1862531	Nintendo isn't helping.
1863131	1865992	They're definitely not helping with Wii music and shit like that.
1868474	1875517	It's really going to take a big game like Grand Theft Auto coming out on it before people go, hey, we can release our game on there and actually make it for the Wii only.
1876960	1877700	All right, fair enough.
1877720	1883842	Well, look, one thing that is certainly exclusive to the Wii that we haven't seen on other systems yet is waggling and motion.
1884383	1890905	And motion's about to get even better when Wii Sports Resort comes out and the Motion Plus accessory comes out.
1891225	1895727	Now, the Motion Plus was developed by a company called InvenSense, actually made this accessory.
1896007	1899548	Well, news came out this week that this Motion Plus technology exists.
1899628	1908253	There is no exclusive deal with Nintendo, meaning that if InvenSense wanted to, they could take this technology to other companies.
1908754	1910855	Are you listening, Sony or Microsoft?
1919200	1946614	I can't get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there's more interest out there so you know rumors have been abounding for a long time that Microsoft is going to get into the whole motion game although they didn't at E3 which was the expected time personally I don't see the other consoles getting into this whole motion thing in the motion plus you know where I bet this accessory ends up turning up again PC I bet you we see some type of small scale release of this accessory on a PC
1948203	1948724	Here's my thing.
1948964	1954068	If you're Nintendo and you're concerned about having all your proprietary stuff...
1955607	1968034	Why do you put out this peripheral that's supposed to make things better and supposed to make things extremely lifelike or very sensitive to your movements and then you don't make it exclusive to yourself?
1968234	1969015	That's kind of retarded.
1969035	1973898	It's like, I made this really awesome invention that'll make our game system awesome and no one else can have it.
1974018	1974858	Oh wait, no they can.
1974918	1977520	Now GameGuru in chat has a comment that's kind of along those lines.
1977560	1981662	He says, but Nintendo owns the patent on the pointer and that's the big plus for the Wii.
1982002	1982303	Granted, if
1984804	1990028	This MotionPlus technology were to be adapted by the other companies, they wouldn't be able to do it in that same style that the Wii does.
1991569	1993050	Yeah, I don't know.
1994311	1996952	Really, I mean, I think this is going to be like Rock Band and Guitar Hero.
1997473	2001155	Maybe PlayStation will adopt this technology and they'll have 12 axes.
2003477	2007179	They'll just, what they'll do is they'll make something that will work exactly the same.
2007199	2010081	It'll be just different enough so that they can't get sued.
2010222	2010642	That's it.
2012336	2012817	Over Rondo of Blood
2024858	2027000	We're going to have a fight at PAX.
2027740	2028120	Awesome.
2028281	2031183	But I said that I would win because girls play dirty.
2031323	2033485	Which, by the way, all three of us are going to be at PAX in like three weeks.
2033505	2034105	It's going to be great.
2034145	2035146	Three weeks from today.
2035206	2039229	We are going to be flying home, but we will have just spent the weekend at PAX.
2039289	2043712	He can't use the elect beam posture trick on me because the blaster master grenade trick is stronger.
2045294	2045774	Gaming news?
2046194	2047415	I counter with my Konami code.
2047615	2048096	Ha!
2048576	2048776	Okay.
2048896	2050017	They're going to LARP to the death.
2050077	2050297	Can I?
2052459	2053380	LARP to the death.
2053400	2053680	Can I?
2054568	2055468	8 now and whatever the hell 9 on DS soon
2082842	2083422	I know!
2083802	2085143	And this is the DS one.
2085783	2095166	They're talking about Dragon Quest, the Chapters of the Chosen, which is in the trilogy of The Hand of the Heavenly Bride and the Realms of Reverie coming next.
2096446	2102788	So it's supposed to be released in... Okay, here's what it is.
2103028	2106329	Dragon Quest IV was released on the NES in...
2107769	2134379	February 1990 it was Dragon Warrior 4 over here so this is a DS remake is what they're getting and they said that they're supposed to get it on September 12th over in Europe so hey cool and you get that you know fantastic Toriyama artwork so go for it cool the end oh not just the end there's more but wait even more more money more prizes I love it anyway
2135896	2137596	Someone gets a dollar if they guess what game that's from.
2138337	2138897	Smash TV.
2139197	2139677	Where's my dollar?
2140177	2141297	I gave you a dollar before.
2142197	2144278	You get a retro dollar, so I've already given it to you.
2144298	2145598	What can I buy with a retro dollar?
2145958	2146538	iTunes song.
2148019	2148379	Woo!
2148979	2151059	You can buy flashing graphics.
2151179	2153640	Oh, yeah, I can buy flashing retro graphics.
2154860	2156200	Remember things the way they used to be.
2156220	2156861	Chrono Trigger!
2157281	2157741	Ooh, yes.
2158401	2159941	See, that gets Rob's attention.
2161742	2163282	There has been a kind of...
2163322	2165083	I think the PlayStation one came out.
2192199	2192419	Really?
2192579	2192960	I think so.
2193861	2195242	I thought the Super Nintendo one never did, though.
2195703	2196664	I think you're right.
2196684	2197144	I could be wrong.
2197204	2198405	I thought that your update disappeared.
2199587	2201849	Oh, that was for... No, I think that's something else.
2204252	2204532	What was it?
2204552	2205253	What else was I going to say?
2205293	2205753	I'm sorry.
2205773	2206134	Was there more?
2206194	2206454	I'm sorry.
2206474	2206714	Yes.
2207014	2207475	Oh, go ahead.
2208896	2209616	Rob Hart.
2209736	2209957	What?
2210217	2215641	Anyway, but really the DS version, the things it's going to have is a touchscreen control.
2216142	2222567	You can use both the dual screens, a new dungeon, wireless play of some unnamed variety.
2224008	2225969	And it's actually...
2227871	2229412	Pretty cool.
2229632	2238417	And there's also, just if anyone is curious, there is a gallery up on Eurogamer that has screenshots.
2238477	2240798	I'll link that in the chat room if anyone wants to check it out.
2241240	2244684	All right, chat.orangeandre.com if you want to join our chat room.
2244704	2250110	I knew what it was I wanted to ask you about because we were talking about old video games and collecting and all that stuff.
2250130	2250110	42.
2250290	2251251	Okay, sure.
2251831	2252172	Here's the thing.
2252552	2256597	I went to a local record store the other day that was having a big video game sale, used video game sale.
2256997	2260661	I found Zelda II The Adventures of Link in a gold cartridge for $5.
2260901	2262183	Is that a good deal?
2262628	2263649	Yeah, I'd say so.
2263929	2264670	I should have picked that up.
2265030	2269794	Because I was looking at it going, wasn't that the first Zelda they remade in the gray carts?
2270014	2271756	So the gold carts are really valuable?
2272356	2274018	Or am I crazy?
2274679	2276100	But they're neat.
2276540	2277921	Especially if you've got the box.
2278882	2281064	It would be worth $5 just to have the old school cart.
2281104	2284127	We can put it up on the wall in the big blank spot we have on JustinTV.
2284327	2285168	I'm pointing at the blank spot.
2285328	2287630	The thing to watch out for those is the battery.
2288373	2289434	Well, I wouldn't play the game.
2289474	2291056	I don't have an old school Nintendo to play it on.
2291176	2293499	Well, I told you I was going to lend you one if I can find one.
2293519	2294680	Can't you replace the battery?
2295180	2296161	You can replace the battery.
2296181	2299585	If I'm right, I think it just uses a standard small lithium battery.
2301407	2303429	We replace the batteries in our Saturn all the time.
2303970	2305031	And I mean all the damn time.
2306914	2307595	All right, fair enough.
2308515	2310297	Well, all right, let's move on.
2310317	2313719	Sorry to derail the current gaming news, but I just had to know good deals or not.
2313739	2314920	We're doing a public service.
2315240	2316501	Good deal, bad deal.
2316521	2317322	Good deal, bad deal.
2317342	2318823	Your batteries can be saved.
2319644	2322186	The store was advertising a huge video game blowout.
2322206	2323266	It was like five games for $13.
2325037	2325678	Old NES Games
2351232	2352253	They had some in there.
2352413	2352933	Well, yeah.
2352953	2353833	That's where I saw Zelda.
2354314	2365679	Well, originally, before I bought you Blastworks, my intention was to go there and find an original copy of The Guardian Legend, which obviously wouldn't be there because it's too valuable, but, you know.
2367110	2368051	Pala Abdul Spellbound
2388434	2391356	Oh god, that was the one with Rush Rush on it, wasn't it?
2391417	2402245	Yes it was, and it also had such awesome songs as The Promise of a New Day, which I was trying to play a clip of here on air, but my computer's freezing up on me, which probably is a good thing.
2402265	2403486	No, it has a taste screen.
2406689	2407829	Two dollars for this!
2409611	2410512	Diet Coke, yo!
2414392	2415712	Alright, please.
2416093	2417413	Promise of a new game, Loki?
2417933	2418793	Please stop that.
2420334	2423555	There is a pretty cool hack that got released this week on the Wii.
2424435	2432977	And it will allow you to actually play region-free Wii games with no mod chips whatsoever.
2434158	2437398	This will require, though, that you have the Homebrew channel installed.
2438379	2438539	And...
2440239	2440860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2464840	2486308	and you can also remove the health warning screen that pops up in the beginning of when you turn the Wii on well thank god because that thing annoys me more than anything I believe you have to have Wii system version 3.2 I want to say so which unfortunately if you have it all the way updated now you can't use this I'm sorry I can't stop laughing
2486920	2490888	at the fact that somebody actually sat there and said, you know what I'm going to do to my Wii?
2491489	2493213	You know what project I'm going to take on?
2493774	2497421	I'm going to get rid of that health warning screen because damn it, that thing's annoying.
2501420	2506003	Meanwhile, people are starving in other countries and war breaks out.
2506343	2507844	But you got rid of the health warning.
2507864	2508444	I guess it is.
2508864	2512867	The process to patch it is safe so you won't brick your console.
2513167	2518790	The only thing that will happen is if you update your console again, it will erase all these updates that you've just made to it.
2519551	2520471	That's the only problem.
2520811	2523433	But they are working on ways to prevent that.
2523593	2527895	Like I said, I think it's only compatible right now with...
2529261	2530982	Version 3.2 firmware.
2531202	2535104	Actdeft is saying in chat that patch is only for Europe, Loki, with patching quotes.
2537004	2538645	I thought it was for more than just Europe.
2541446	2544007	Does anyone really need to remove the health warning screen that bad?
2544047	2544688	I mean, really?
2545388	2545628	Really?
2546408	2546689	I don't know.
2547009	2547789	Is it that intrusive?
2548589	2549470	Maybe you should be reading it.
2551691	2554192	Anything else in the Wii hacking world going on that we should be aware of?
2555232	2556293	No, that would be it.
2556713	2556933	Okay.
2557597	2558838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2579433	2588696	and what apparently Game Daily, in this interview, he says that he kind of admits in a way that Sonic has not been quite as good as it could have been.
2589076	2593038	I mean, he didn't come out and say Sonic sucks, but there was this interesting quote.
2593498	2595259	Some of that criticism is probably warranted.
2595519	2602041	We definitely recognize that a franchise that has been going as long as Sonic, you have to put a huge amount of effort in to make sure that you maintain that quality.
2602321	2630906	which is why you're seeing us this year take the first steps in making sure the quality is right and we're constantly looking at innovation blending classic 2D gameplay with 3D beautiful landscape rich environments and then it continues on for fans of Sonic that have been looking for the next gen experience this is the game they've been waiting for so I guess all those other games were just I like the way he does that with words kind of sweeps the other games under the table oh no no this is the game you've been waiting for right here this is the good stuff
2632700	2633180	Awesome.
2633261	2633641	Mean it.
2633801	2640385	That's all I say and mean it because you only got so many chances left before people just, you know, aren't buying this anymore.
2640646	2641646	But then again, I don't know.
2641686	2646089	You could make 20 crappy Sonic games and if one comes out and it's really good, word will get around.
2646149	2646810	People will buy it.
2647352	2649913	It's just about time they say, yeah, we fucked up.
2650613	2657396	I was going to ask you, as a Sonic fangirl, I mean, general Sega fangirl in general, look at your Classic Games of the Week.
2658576	2662117	The last Sonic game that they did right was the first Sonic Adventure, I thought.
2662797	2667379	And I did like, what was the racing game that they had on PSP?
2668239	2669340	Sonic Rush, wasn't it?
2669560	2669940	I think so.
2670320	2671500	That one was pretty fun, too.
2672201	2672421	But...
2673081	2674162	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2695414	2718290	And here's the comment you always see anytime Sega gets brought up by SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelongeradio.com Dear Sega, Shenmue 3 I liked the Shenmue series, so whatever Shenmue was one of those things that was hokey when it came out, but it aged like a fine wine It was great, and Seaman Let's play Lucky Hit Well, how about something else?
2718430	2719191	How about something else?
2720091	2725074	EA, I know people like to groan and everything, but here's something new to groan about.
2726734	2735139	EA is going to be doing a series of games for PC and DS that is going to be off of the For Dummies series of books.
2736279	2741602	You can actually, for now, download Poker for Dummies on PC off the Pogo download area.
2743523	2744964	Well, in theory, you're supposed to be able to.
2744984	2747026	That means if it's up there.
2747066	2751649	But there's also going to be Texas Hold'em, Omaha, Seven Car Stud.
2753371	2756393	And then there's going to be Solitaire for Dummies, Brain Training for Dummies.
2756874	2757714	That's in October.
2757854	2759135	The Solitaire one's in September.
2759596	2761957	Sudoku for Dummies in November.
2762358	2763699	And a whole bunch more.
2764076	2765177	How about Braid for dummies?
2765737	2767618	That's what I need.
2768279	2768879	I'm serious.
2770460	2771921	I want games for smart people.
2774143	2777205	I want Mensa Solitaire.
2777245	2784450	Then you need to go play those cruel games like I Want to Be the Guy or La Mulana or those types of games that are cruel and unusual.
2784710	2787312	No, I mean like poker and puzzle and stuff games.
2787832	2788673	I want Mensa Solitaire.
2792042	2794643	Fair enough, but here's the problem I have with this whole thing.
2795043	2799024	Although it's cute that they have the licensing for dummies, look at the games they're putting out.
2799084	2801485	Sudoku, Solitaire, Texas Hold'em.
2801525	2805266	I mean, we've got like 50,000 versions of those games across all the consoles already.
2805606	2810248	What's going to make these so special besides the four dummies tagline and the little cartoon guy pointing?
2812129	2813569	The fact that people are admitting to it.
2814209	2814829	That's pretty funny.
2815850	2816230	I guess.
2817438	2818219	GameGuru suggests Sonic for dummies.
2818259	2819200	Frisbee says dummies for dummies.
2834518	2836159	They have for dummies everything now.
2837220	2838361	They have childbirth for dummies.
2838381	2839622	They have podcasting for dummies.
2840423	2841223	Guess what?
2841904	2842924	We didn't need that book.
2842964	2846427	We're living examples of the fact that any dummy can podcast.
2847508	2847948	For real.
2849349	2850931	I thought it took a special kind of dummy.
2852011	2852332	It does.
2852492	2856635	It takes a special sort of self-depreciating dummy to do it every week.
2857356	2862600	It takes a special kind of dummy or dare I say it, idiot to do it for over six years.
2863619	2865200	And who's coming up on 300?
2865260	2866800	Practically every Sunday straight.
2866880	2869521	I mean, granted, we miss some here and there, but, you know.
2869881	2870141	I don't know.
2870161	2871021	I thought we were a little crooked.
2872582	2874242	We're all a little bent here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2874503	2875963	Hey, how about release dates for Dummies?
2876323	2876623	Yes.
2877343	2887847	Well, this week, I hope you like Madden because that's coming out on everything, including God knows why, the original Xbox.
2888800	2889861	Sinkin' Island Sinkin' Island
2915045	2916005	The island sinks!
2916546	2918106	Oh my god, spoiler alert!
2918806	2921107	And then the ship crashes into an iceberg.
2921527	2924007	And Jack dies, oh my god.
2924068	2924968	I'm glad you asked.
2925488	2931389	Sinking Island is about Walter Jones, a billionaire, who is found dead at the bottom of a huge art building.
2931409	2933110	A billionaire and his wife.
2933910	2935071	Wait, this sounds a lot like Bioshock.
2935612	2943379	Found dead at the bottom of a huge Art Deco tower that he had built as a magnificent getaway on a tropical island.
2943860	2951107	There are ten suspects who all have a motive for Mr. Jones' untimely death, as Inspector Jack Norm
2951787	2959453	3 days before the island disappears and sinks into the ocean to find the truth behind this mysterious death and catch the killer
2974785	2976725	And I hope the island does sink and you're on it.
2977026	2984087	If that's not amazing enough for you, then maybe the Cheetah Girls Passport to Stardom on the DS would be your type of game.
2984127	2985167	Best week ever!
2985807	2986287	Awesome.
2986467	2988688	Well, here's actually a game that might not be so bad.
2988768	2990488	Space Siege is coming out on the PC.
2991388	2992109	Wait, Space Age?
2992309	2994449	Space Siege, like Dungeon Siege.
2994629	2996869	I was thinking Space Ace in my mind for some reason.
2996930	2999850	Hopefully there will not be a movie being made for this.
3001250	3003811	Also this week, Imagine Teacher
3004824	3006826	for you to teach your Imagine Babies.
3006866	3007226	I don't know.
3008207	3009108	Yes, Imagine Teacher.
3009489	3010129	Imagine Teacher.
3010490	3011911	I am a teacher, kind of.
3011931	3012572	I teach adults.
3012592	3014173	That's my day job.
3014193	3018097	This game, you actually have to create lesson plans and stuff like that.
3018237	3019778	I'm kind of curious about this game.
3020940	3026044	Silent Hunter 4, the Gold Edition is coming out on PC as well.
3027766	3030528	Ford Racing Off-Road, also for the PC.
3032650	3034992	And... Oh, did I forget to mention?
3035152	3037374	Madden the 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition.
3037995	3039936	So that's a whole bunch of Madden and a whole bunch of...
3041117	3048800	Oh, I'm sorry, and I think I didn't see it on the list, but I think I thought Line Rider 2 was supposed to be coming out this week.
3049421	3054743	Although, judging that I don't see it on this list anymore, it might have been delayed.
3055803	3065667	And if you want to check out Madden, but you don't feel like shelling out that kind of money, you could probably find Madden 05 or Madden 04 for about $2 this week at certain closeout sales.
3065747	3067668	Yeah, we've got, I want to say, 900 copies of Madden 05.
3070822	3071122	Nice.
3072043	3072944	We'll sell them cheap.
3073544	3075906	Can you melt them down in a landfill or something like that?
3076247	3077548	I've told them to throw them away.
3078569	3080810	Well, let's travel over to Japan and Asia in general.
3080831	3082692	Sometimes we cover the Asian release dates as well.
3083192	3087316	Madden NFL 09 will come out in Asia as well the same day it comes out here in the U.S.
3088077	3093501	Meanwhile, Tales of Vesperia, the Japanese version, also makes its way to other Asian regions this week.
3093861	3096944	Otherwise, in Japan itself, nothing on the Xbox 360 this week.
3097525	3098425	How about on the PlayStation 3?
3099346	3099967	Same story.
3099987	3100827	There's really nothing new.
3100847	3104271	You're going to have to wait until the 21st when Vampire Reign comes out for something new.
3105312	3109776	Moving on to the Wii, nothing there either.
3110496	3112298	It's a very slow week in Japan.
3112858	3116221	I guess just not a lot of demand.
3116742	3118984	Do you think they're all importing Madden, or what the hell's going on?
3119437	3121359	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3143984	3152291	This could be DarkSakura if she had blonde hair and disproportionate sized boobies and one eye strangely larger than the other.
3155173	3158256	Sometimes I wish you sat on cam because that was really funny.
3158296	3159297	I've had blonde hair before.
3159657	3160498	It sucks.
3161158	3161539	Really?
3161759	3162640	I'd like to see that.
3162740	3163821	You've seen me with blonde bangs.
3164358	3165419	I have seen you in blonde hair.
3165439	3166640	I did not look good at all.
3167021	3167581	Wow.
3168402	3169263	Alright, fair enough.
3170064	3174849	Coming out on the Nintendo DS, a game called I'm sorry, it's not a game, it's an accessory.
3175409	3179593	Accessories for your DS to make it look like Stitch from Leo and Stitch or Jack Skellington.
3179613	3180294	That looks kind of cool.
3180714	3182656	Or Poo from Winnie the Pooh.
3182977	3183877	You can check those out.
3184198	3186400	Otherwise on the DS, there's no games coming out this week.
3186440	3187701	You can make it look like poo.
3188462	3189923	That's a really slow week.
3190303	3194744	On the PSP, Crazy Taxi Double Punch, which I thought we talked about last week.
3194784	3195504	It must have gotten delayed.
3196125	3201106	Also, Memories of Sword of Kata is coming out on the PSP from Cyberfront.
3201786	3206028	And it looks to be another game starring Anime Girls.
3207630	3212434	StrongBad's Cool Game for Attractive People Episode 1, Homestar Ruiner on PC and Wii
3230327	3241641	Fable 2 Pub Games on Xbox 360, Ferrari Challenge on Wii, Madden NFL 2009 on Xbox 360 and Wii, Puzzler Collection on Wii, and Table Football on Wii.
3243723	3245025	Well, that's a Wii-tastic week.
3245726	3246146	Madden.
3246807	3249510	All I've been hearing about that is Madden since my husband has to work the launch.
3250219	3251340	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3265666	3269409	You know my calendar, I have the Freakonomics calendar.
3269909	3280536	It actually stated why they wanted it specifically to be August 8th, 2008 to have the Olympics open is because eight's a lucky number in China.
3281590	3283051	For both And that and women swimming
3311582	3314823	Is women's volleyball still got the same outfits they had four years ago?
3315363	3315703	I don't know.
3315723	3319924	All those women are kind of like female gym teachers anyways, and no thanks.
3320184	3321484	Not really.
3321664	3331086	Also, though, I actually have to crack up because I want to see if anyone makes the same mistake that the target shoot guy did last year.
3331466	3336707	And to hit the target beyond his target, that's pretty awesome.
3336847	3338708	However, he did not hit his target.
3340458	3342340	Is Geena Davis going to be doing archery this year?
3342380	3344281	That's what I want to know.
3344702	3346903	Thelma is an archer.
3348885	3349245	Forget it.
3349986	3354149	I was going to say my favorite events are the ninjutsu events.
3355190	3355610	The what?
3355850	3356931	The ninjutsu events.
3357191	3358012	They have ninja events?
3358673	3359373	I like fencing.
3359513	3360434	You never see them.
3361415	3362075	Shut up.
3362515	3363356	He likes curling.
3363596	3365838	Curling is awesome.
3365858	3367019	That's the best part of DECA sports.
3367399	3369040	That's the best part of the summer event.
3370171	3370571	Shut up.
3371072	3371812	Gaming news.
3373894	3374575	Fable 2.
3375215	3378978	They've made the announcement that it's coming out October 21st in the US.
3379399	3380740	October 24th in Europe.
3381480	3398555	And, of course, along with that, you're going to be getting the Fable 2 Collector's Edition, which includes some, I guess they're like tarot cards, a bonus DVD with some behind-the-scenes stuff, also a little figurine,
3399495	3408445	And if you pre-order your games now, as Jamie mentioned, the Xbox Live Arcade Pub Games will be available starting August 13th.
3409526	3417995	One other cool thing, though, that you get with the limited edition is Master Chief, created in Fable 2.
3418095	3420577	As opposed to Master Chef.
3420597	3421819	Using the character creator.
3423590	3424190	Interesting.
3425131	3425631	I suppose.
3425791	3426611	That's pretty cool.
3427252	3428512	Although he looked a little weird.
3428552	3433634	I mean, it's kind of like taking a character that looks kind of like him and calling him Master Chief.
3434314	3434735	It's weird.
3435435	3441977	Well, they had something like this that they did during a demonstration at E3 where they created a character like this and I guess they kind of tweaked it a little bit more.
3442858	3443198	I don't know.
3443398	3443838	It's neat.
3443938	3444719	He has a lot of belts.
3445719	3446359	A lot of belts.
3446859	3448540	I don't know.
3449200	3453222	I mean, I'm getting the limited edition because I like crap like that
3456825	3457125	All right.
3457205	3461470	I apologize in advance if I'm horribly mispronouncing the name of this thing.
3461530	3463332	It's Onichambara?
3463472	3464514	Is that what that's called?
3464534	3464874	That's correct.
3465074	3465635	All right.
3465695	3466696	My Japanese is getting better.
3467016	3468938	But just disregard that.
3468998	3471561	You might want to know this game as Bikini Samurai Squad.
3471661	3472743	It's still Onichambara.
3472823	3473804	That's just a subtitle.
3474901	3481465	Whatever, but look, it's chicks, and speaking of women's volleyball outfits, it's chicks in bikinis wielding swords.
3481665	3484407	I mean, hello, do you need anything more in a video game?
3484587	3486128	The only thing this game is missing is zombies.
3486288	3487949	Oh wait, I think they have those too.
3488289	3489670	They're battling a zombie horde.
3489970	3491311	I mean, do games get any better?
3491411	3491911	I think not.
3492291	3495673	It's a chick wearing lingerie with a cowboy hat.
3495713	3496734	You forgot the cowboy hat.
3496774	3497274	Oh my bad.
3497474	3499696	And she has a samurai sword killing zombies.
3500256	3500776	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3515799	3517020	Thank God it's finally here.
3517040	3518121	It is coming out over here.
3518241	3521423	D3 Publisher is going to port the game to the U.S.
3522383	3530048	in hopes that people everywhere will bow down to women with swords and bikinis slashing zombies.
3530449	3531770	DarkSakura, sound like your kind of game?
3532110	3532830	That sounds like fun.
3533030	3534011	I know, it does sound like fun.
3534091	3537253	If you don't want it on 360, remember they do have the Wii version coming out as well.
3537473	3538014	All right.
3539034	3539415	Wii!
3541516	3547262	You know, I almost brought my Wii today to view that game.
3547943	3548383	Next week, though.
3548403	3548744	Next week.
3549044	3549725	Or whenever.
3550005	3550886	I must see this game.
3551046	3552968	You know, we should just have a special playing.
3553308	3554870	And make that our pre-recording.
3555371	3556312	Ooh, that might work.
3556752	3558814	Get that game imported or whatever you gotta do.
3558894	3559515	Let's check it out.
3559875	3560096	Alright.
3560436	3561497	I already have it, yeah.
3561577	3561817	Sweet!
3564147	3565067	Other news!
3565887	3570990	We've been sitting around speculating about why Final Fantasy XIII is going to be coming out on Xbox 360.
3571750	3573811	Well, Microsoft has said something.
3573891	3580394	Actually, one of their marketers, Albert Penelo, said that it was actually the Xbox 360 sales.
3580594	3581935	I had speculated before.
3582996	3586218	were what would bring Final Fantasy XIII to the system.
3587659	3592163	They said that they didn't really make any sort of behind-doors deal.
3592583	3597107	They didn't offer a lot of money for Squeenix to break their exclusive...
3599689	3602292	Exclusivity contract.
3603152	3604113	I can't speak today.
3604293	3604694	That's alright.
3605174	3606035	I've had a crap week.
3606055	3607396	They offered the market share.
3607596	3609758	That's what they offered them.
3609918	3613561	Xbox 360 does have the superior market in the United States.
3615543	3618864	So far, they've had more term on it, more sales overall.
3620365	3628890	And they're actually stating right now that that was the specific reason that Square said, you know what, let's just do it.
3628990	3631111	Let's put it out on the 360 in the US.
3631832	3636554	And they also are committed to a simultaneous launch for both of them.
3637295	3641637	But their speculation is that it's going to hold up our PS3 release date in the US.
3641917	3642178	Mm-hmm.
3643038	3650983	But, depending on how long they've had this idea forming, they may have already started work on the port.
3651043	3651703	I can hope so.
3651803	3656146	They swear they haven't, and they're not going to, but you never know.
3656346	3659828	I saw the note on there that says they haven't begun work on the 360 version yet.
3659988	3660909	But it could be a lie.
3661509	3662049	You know what I mean?
3662369	3662950	It could be a lie.
3663630	3664851	They don't have to tell us the truth.
3665350	3667133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3680158	3690642	I don't think that they... What they do when they start programming these games is just... You're not going to have, oh, we are going to do everything on this dev kit.
3690682	3694644	No, you're going to start your textures in whatever your 3D program is.
3694664	3698605	You're going to start laying out your scripts and other programs.
3698665	3703507	It's got to come together on a PC or Mac or something.
3704187	3705648	Maybe they do it in Linux, I don't know.
3706468	3718012	But anyway, whatever way, they have to come through it on some sort of computer to get everything together, and then it's made compatible with the hardware given.
3718152	3728915	So I think it's not going to be that difficult, especially since we've seen plenty of ports from one system to the other that didn't lose all that much.
3728935	3729335	Right.
3729775	3731316	Alright, let's get some comments from chat.
3731396	3735018	JV Mon says, I don't mind Final Fantasy XIII being delayed if it means I get it on the 360.
3736359	3740782	Kel Tipo says, Final Fantasy XIII seems so far off at this point, another delay doesn't seem so bad.
3741202	3742063	That's kind of how I feel.
3742183	3748867	I mean, it's that little spark way off in the distance that, you know, I'm kind of not expecting to see this game before Christmas next year anyway.
3749267	3749888	So there you have it.
3749908	3755231	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night as we tape on AllGames.com as we always do.
3755251	3758213	6 o'clock Pacific time on Sunday nights, except for next week.
3758593	3759454	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3775310	3775750	Let's move on.
3775770	3778652	We've got the classic game of the week coming up in just a couple more stories in our break.
3778932	3779192	Yes, we do.
3779212	3780813	And then part B, Loki.
3781293	3783854	Besides, I have one question for you.
3783994	3786495	What is better than Final Fantasy XIII?
3786976	3788697	Well, I'll answer that with another question.
3789317	3790858	Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
3791098	3793399	Damn straight, that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
3793739	3794699	Game of the year right there.
3794719	3796740	Will it have Death Foxworthy?
3797241	3799082	Yes, it will have CG Death Foxworthy.
3799422	3800602	It looks like a zombie, by the way.
3800682	3801102	I don't know.
3801323	3802803	Can a fifth grader beat Braid?
3802983	3803844	If so, I'm in trouble.
3805422	3807624	I don't know, maybe.
3807924	3812108	Is this going to be one of their massively online games they were teasing at E3, like 1 versus 100?
3812308	3816492	No, I'm going to guess this is going to be a crappy port of the Wii game that's coming out.
3817592	3821196	But it is being put out by THQ, which I do think they are putting out the crappy game.
3822317	3828382	And yeah, it should be coming out sometime after all the cool games come out on Xbox Live Arcade this month.
3828642	3830944	Oh well.
3832196	3833938	Hey, wait, it's Xbox Live Arcade?
3834558	3835539	Xbox Live Arcade.
3835720	3837702	Well, that's kind of interesting, I guess.
3838282	3841285	So I can embarrass myself and my friends online with what I don't know.
3842486	3842787	Yeah.
3843607	3850935	Although usually I seem to watch the show and I seem to do okay on the show, but sometimes there's like a world history question that I just don't get because history was never my strong subject.
3852481	3854683	I don't know, he's just creepy looking, man.
3855044	3859288	Seriously, it's like, if you get this question wrong, I'm gonna jump through the TV and eat your brain.
3859328	3860709	Look how small his head is!
3861390	3862932	His head's shaped like a cantaloupe.
3864834	3866856	I'm gonna show the chatroom what his head looks like, okay?
3869979	3871020	Look at his head!
3873187	3876430	Dark Tetsuya says, bye, give me the mole on Xbox Live Arcade.
3876770	3879252	Reality games on Xbox Live Arcade, I don't think that could happen, though.
3879773	3882875	They're too psychological intensive.
3882955	3889020	Anyway, speaking of Xbox Live Arcade games, we've been talking a lot, a lot, a lot about Braid tonight, as a lot of people have been talking about Braid.
3889341	3893784	What's very interesting, though, have you checked out the official walkthrough for Braid?
3894505	3897347	The creator, Jonathan Blow, actually put up an official walkthrough for Braid.
3897387	3898749	It's available at braid-game.com.
3899389	3900390	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3918480	3932402	solve the puzzles yourself and stop using a walkthrough you stupid dork all the puzzles in Braid are reasonable if you're having problems solving a puzzle don't give up please do not use a walkthrough don't give up thank you for your time
3934028	3961340	and yet might I point out the irony that currently this game is sitting at number 3 on the most requested FAQs on GameFAQs probably from people feeling as dumb as me however I will say though there are rewards to be got from this game like any game from not using a walkthrough that's not going to stop some people that want to know the story and there is going to come a point where I'm just not going to be able to freaking resist but I do like the little trick played on us by the official developers I thought it was cute if nothing else
3961880	3965243	And that was something I found, by the way, on Major Nelson's Twitter, which you were saying earlier in the show.
3965723	3967825	I've been putting that to major use.
3968665	3971307	That and there's some pretty funny stuff that he posts every so often.
3971468	3974070	You should also add on the Xbox staff, Trixie's there.
3974350	3977372	She posts a lot more random stuff, but she's a good read, too.
3977572	3979434	There's a lot of great gaming people on Twitter.
3979494	3981455	That's like the place where everybody's at right now.
3981535	3983577	I have Twitterific on my iPhone.
3983797	3986459	There's so many other indie game podcasters I'm following on Twitter.
3986519	3988381	Godfrey, GamerEaty, Bobby.
3989162	3990162	Off the top of my head.
3990182	3993885	Well, on top of that, there's other famous individuals on it.
3993905	3994686	Will Wheaton has a Twitter.
3995467	3996127	So I've been reading that.
3996147	3998029	Dude, Obama is following me.
3998750	4000471	No, that's how I found his Twitter.
4000731	4001051	Nice.
4001552	4006176	And I was like, dude, I'm not even anything on there that says anything about being Democrat.
4006296	4007217	I'm a libertarian.
4008918	4009779	Although I'm voting for him.
4009919	4010139	All right.
4011864	4013725	Danger, danger, political discussion, danger.
4014065	4014566	I know it's all right.
4014826	4016107	I can say who I'm voting for.
4016127	4016807	That's fine, that's fine.
4017147	4017388	All right.
4018368	4027494	Let's get into other topics, though, like your vote for the classic game of the week that all the kids should be playing this week because every week you like to pick a game from the archives.
4028255	4032177	And this week, as I understand it, we have a nice change of pace.
4032718	4034199	It's not Sega-related this week.
4034859	4035199	Sort of.
4035860	4036640	I'm just messing with you.
4036660	4038642	All right, here it is, folks, your classic game of the week.
4039912	4043757	What should the kiddies be dusting off and playing this week?
4044077	4047161	I think this also wins the About Damn Time award, too.
4047682	4049404	Because the game that I picked is Tempest 2000.
4051066	4051327	Nice.
4051647	4055132	Tempest 2000 is one of the only good games on the Atari Jaguar.
4056081	4060123	It is the only Atari Jaguar game that I have ever used in this segment.
4060703	4063805	And I'm actually referring to the Sega Saturn version, which is the one that I have.
4064526	4067527	So, screw a bunch of the Atari Jaguar.
4067667	4072650	I have played this on the Jaguar, believe it or not, and I endorse it on the Jaguar.
4072670	4073090	It's a good time.
4073110	4073950	You just have to play the music.
4074031	4076592	Let's take a listen to some of the hot techno music in the game.
4083322	4083802	Remember this?
4085223	4088064	Super Zapper Recharge.
4089445	4089745	Nice.
4090726	4091126	Good times.
4091186	4092567	Anyway, tell us a little more about Tempest 2000.
4093207	4099871	Well, if anyone's ever played the original Tempest, it was a vector game that was put out by Atari.
4101297	4126997	where you go on a series of different shaped fields and you can only move left or right for yourself but you'll have like ones that look like a V or some that look like a giant octagon or the first stage is basically a straight plane but this one other than just shooting the little ships as they approach your ship on this plane you have other little goodies added
4128738	4130719	You also have spikes that come up.
4131659	4133240	I think the spikes were in the original, too.
4133780	4135961	You have to shoot the spikes all the way back down to the bottom.
4137522	4141083	If the enemy ship gets up to the top of the plane, they can catch you.
4141564	4148707	Now, what they've added to this one is you get a particle laser so that you can shoot faster and more energy.
4148927	4150767	You can gain points.
4152208	4156091	for bonus ships and stuff.
4156371	4160274	You can get a jump power-up, so you can jump over the enemies when they're on the top line.
4160674	4165318	An AI droid, which is just this little vector cube that follows you around and shoots.
4165958	4174725	A warp token, so you can... Wait, wait, wait, we have to listen to this part.
4175025	4177046	Oh, this version does have the voice, did it?
4177126	4178427	No, it says it really quietly.
4178447	4180069	The Super Zapper recharges it on the...
4180729	4182130	Super Zapper Recharge is the best part.
4182211	4183912	Do we get to see the bonus stage in this clip?
4183932	4186555	Because that part of the game always tripped me out.
4186615	4187235	Oh, that's alright.
4206201	4208103	It had the weird ambient music too.
4208143	4210505	Let me turn it down a little bit because those gunshots are getting a little annoying.
4210525	4211005	Alright, go ahead.
4211285	4212006	Sorry.
4212566	4219432	But you also, as you go through, you can get warp tokens to travel to different stages.
4220193	4229200	You can also get a power-up to destroy all of the enemies that are on the screen and move you to the next level.
4229260	4230161	It's called Outta Here.
4231877	4239363	You get one that, well, the female voice in there goes, yes, yes, yes, when you get this power-up.
4240664	4243506	And you get it when you're warping off a completed one.
4244067	4252334	So when you start your next level, the first power-up that you get is an AI droid.
4252914	4259900	And it says, yes, yes, yes, but in that really high-pitched sort of, oh, baby way.
4260460	4261381	Eat electric death.
4262006	4262587	I love that.
4262628	4267718	When you use your giant zapper thing, it says, eat electric death.
4267738	4268920	It just happened in the clip here.
4269040	4269982	Eat electric death.
4270002	4270503	Caught you.
4271225	4271606	Guy died.
4272040	4273520	and when it says catchy, it goes, whoa!
4274641	4281502	So we've also got other versions, like this particular music that we're playing here is like I said, the Sega Saturn version.
4282502	4285903	It did first come out on Atari Jaguar.
4286443	4290364	There was a PlayStation version that's called Tempest X3.
4292604	4300086	It's supposed to be updated graphics and music, but it's, I don't, actually I don't think it's as much fun
4301046	4310531	Um, however, if you are, if you put, in all caps, Y-I-F-F exclamation point on the high score table, you get to play the original Tempest 2000.
4310791	4311511	Nice.
4311531	4313772	But it doesn't save any of your high scores, so that's kind of sad.
4314232	4315453	They also have this on PC, right?
4315573	4318234	Yes, there's a PC version, which I've got it somewhere.
4319115	4321756	Um, there's also, um...
4324588	4325489	Space Giraffe Space Giraffe
4341429	4344231	It was kind of funny, like it had its moments, it was really funny.
4344652	4347974	But the problem I had with it is that graphically the game was ruined.
4348535	4351257	I mean, how graphics can single-handedly ruin a game.
4352077	4356601	And the same problem I had with Tempest on Xbox Live Arcade.
4357121	4360104	They remade the original Tempest, did this whole remake of the original Tempest.
4360384	4362586	It was missing that... There's a Tempest 3000.
4362946	4369231	There's that X factor I can't put my finger on that Tempest 2000 had that the Tempest on Xbox Live Arcade most definitely doesn't have.
4369531	4375755	I do have to tell you one thing, though, that I do really like about the PlayStation version, Tempest X3, is it used the NegCon.
4377276	4385742	The NegCon for the uninitiated is, it's a Namco controller that you, it's separate in the center so it twists.
4385802	4389205	It was made for Wipeout and other racing games.
4389305	4390205	I have four of them.
4390566	4391206	Nice.
4391907	4395069	It took me forever to find them, but I have two Japanese ones and two American ones.
4395789	4409896	Um, but, um, the other thing, um, that I think is interesting is that anyone likes the music in this one, um, it was actually done by Imagine Design, which is now Brilliant Development, and they did the music for Jaguar games Alien vs. Predator and Battlemorph.
4410817	4415719	So, um, and I do recall Alien vs. Predator actually having some pretty sweet music.
4416600	4422783	Um, you can also use the Jaguar's rotary controller on this, too, so you can get your sort of unschooled.
4423163	4424004	What do we say about the Jaguar?
4424024	4424264	It sucked!
4444724	4446685	Well, you know what, I take that back.
4447186	4453430	Because there were other, there were, there was another couple of good games, but I think they were also remade, original games too.
4453470	4455911	Yeah, anything that was on the Jaguar, it was good, it was probably remade.
4456232	4460895	But at any rate, there have been people who actually went out and made a rotary controller.
4462376	4464897	So you can find them online somewhere.
4464997	4468400	And people have modified old 2600 controllers and they're doing them too.
4468900	4474663	But anyway, it was designed by Jeff Minter.
4476383	4482366	So I say go check out some of his other contributions too, even though he did give us Space Giraffe.
4483766	4485347	Alright, so that's it then.
4485607	4487108	Tempest 2000, Classic Game of the Week.
4487128	4490509	I was really just trying to talk a whole lot so you could keep your music playing because I like your music.
4490889	4492550	Well, the clip's about up, so there you have it.
4493110	4494471	Your Classic Game of the Week, Tempest 2000.
4494911	4496252	Favorite thing about the game in a nutshell?
4497239	4498079	It's awesome.
4499200	4500240	There's not a favorite thing.
4500300	4502261	It's the entire package.
4502641	4504041	It's the whole thing is one.
4504681	4505161	Fair enough.
4505261	4506282	I will accept that answer.
4506662	4511103	Alright, that's going to do it for our Classic Game of the Week and for Part A here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4511383	4512164	Stay tuned, guys.
4512184	4516745	We'll be right back after a quick free break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4523041	4526405	There are a couple of other things I just tell you when I remember.
4527226	4528267	He's crazy.
4528507	4534474	If you could not see the similarities in the personalities within the first couple of episodes, you need brain surgery.
4534674	4535095	I mean, seriously.
4535115	4535235	Slappy.
4539960	4540400	How?
4540440	4542461	You didn't have to hit me so hard.
4542481	4543521	It wasn't that hard.
4543621	4548463	Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your hosts DJ Ranma S and Kuro Usagi.
4548503	4554085	Log on to DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.
4555546	4558167	How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?
4560548	4561728	We should have a rape carnival.
4564129	4566110	Tell them to rape things because rape is funny.
4569232	4571694	Walk around the neighborhood and rape cats in your neighborhood.
4571734	4572535	Hold a plastic knife.
4572555	4573476	You have to have a plastic knife.
4574456	4575197	And take pictures.
4577379	4579480	Ladies and gentlemen, rape isn't funny.
4581202	4582203	Unless if it's clown rape.
4588775	4590177	Rape of people is not funny.
4590237	4592379	Rape of monsters is funny.
4593300	4594601	Because monsters are bad.
4595442	4596944	And when bad people... What?
4597044	4599506	I'm just not going to keep going down this line.
4599566	4600367	I'm digging myself a hole.
4600567	4602009	Orange Lounge Radio.
4602289	4605573	The video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.
4605933	4609896	Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.
4610256	4615781	To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.
4616081	4617662	Well, except that asshole.
4618483	4620745	And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4621445	4630412	There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.
4631973	4633294	It doesn't even fucking make sense.
4633455	4635156	Welcome back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4635794	4639077	August the 10th, 2008 is the night we are taping live.
4639157	4642659	Myself, Rob Roberts, joining me as always, DarkSakura, Loki.
4642679	4642719	Hi!
4643440	4646702	Back for more gaming news after feeling a little full.
4646882	4653947	I had some pretzels to snack on during the break there and some vitamin water to refresh me now, even though they say this stuff is really not as good for you as you'd think.
4654368	4655088	I'm full of energy.
4655308	4656009	It's better than soda.
4656089	4656349	Good!
4656970	4657490	Lots of energy.
4657550	4658811	Lots of energy to get through gaming news?
4659371	4659692	Yes!
4659872	4660592	How about you, Loki?
4660612	4661273	Are you energetic?
4663984	4664564	I guess not.
4664644	4666605	Will you mind doing some gaming news for us anyway?
4666745	4666965	Yeah.
4667125	4667585	Alright, sure.
4668405	4682908	So, it's already been rumored that it's coming out at some point, but Guitar Hero Metallica was pretty much confirmed by Metallica themselves during an interview with Lars Orch.
4683548	4690409	And basically, the quote is, if somebody's going to follow up Guitar Hero Aerosmith, we're talking...
4691330	4698623	We're talking and it's exciting and the people at Guitar Hero and Activision are rapidly becoming our best new friends in the world.
4699124	4700746	You can put the rest of it together yourself.
4702670	4702991	So yeah.
4703971	4708793	Guitar Hero, Metallica, once again, horning up the franchise next year.
4709494	4713496	But there's going to be a lot of people that are going to buy this game, even more so than Aerosmith, I predict.
4713536	4713836	Yeah, probably.
4713876	4718738	I mean, Aerosmith's a pretty rockin' band, don't get me wrong, but Metallica's even, like, more so.
4719198	4720759	Metallica is godly.
4720999	4725301	Even after the backlash of Napster and all that, you know, we've kind of forgotten about that.
4725341	4726202	It's such a really good light-satinger.
4727816	4731858	Am I one of the few people on the planet that actually liked Reload and Load, those albums?
4731899	4732379	I loved it.
4732399	4733679	I thought those albums were pretty good.
4733960	4737622	Like, the best part of those albums was the fact that Marianne Faithfull was on a song.
4737782	4738642	That was so rad.
4738882	4742524	But nothing ever tops the awesome that was the S&M concert.
4743605	4745686	Oh, was that the orchestra?
4745706	4751209	The one with Cayman and the, what was it, Berklee, I think?
4751489	4753090	Yeah, it was local, from where they're from.
4754312	4758983	I just thought it was funny that people who bought season passes for theater and opera had to listen to Metallica.
4759865	4761966	Comments from our chatroom, chat.orangelonceradio.com.
4762046	4765428	Actdeft says, Lars is a big sellout, according to Actdeft.
4765448	4767430	So there are still some people that are Metallica-hating.
4768090	4772272	Jvmon says, my store still has dozens and dozens of Guitar Hero Aerosmith still in my store.
4772532	4773673	You know, I've noticed the same thing.
4773793	4775414	Loki, any idea?
4775434	4779777	I don't know if you know anything from the inside, but any idea on how Aerosmith Guitar Hero has been selling?
4781097	4783038	We sold a lot of it, and then...
4784755	4785475	That's about it.
4785655	4787056	No, not a lot of reorders.
4787276	4789777	So, okay, isn't that bad, though, when there's not a lot of reorders?
4789797	4792378	Because that means the ones that were bought for the shelves aren't leaving.
4792939	4793399	Isn't that bad?
4794279	4794559	Could be.
4794839	4796800	I mean, I'm not trying to distort the facts or whatever.
4796880	4797781	Maybe they are selling really good.
4797801	4801963	We'll have to look at the MPD numbers at the end of July to see how it did.
4802303	4804464	Actually, though, it'll probably still be doing pretty well through July.
4804524	4808526	Maybe the MPD number is in September for August to see how well it's doing.
4809286	4809766	All right, good.
4809846	4813828	Because, you know, it sold a lot, but a lot of people were just picking it up
4817298	4821782	JV Mon continues, Guitar Hero Aerosmith sold really well the first week, then people stopped caring.
4822543	4825906	I do intend on picking it up, but again, I'm holding out for a price drop.
4825926	4829729	And if they're not leaving shelves, maybe that'll happen sooner than people were telling me it was going to.
4829889	4834894	The other thing, too, you have to look at is a lot of people may have already had the guitar bundles for it already.
4835054	4838918	So maybe people just bought way too many bundles.
4839418	4839899	and DarkSakura.com
4846870	4849472	Say you're in the Guitar Hero and you've had one through three already.
4849492	4851033	You probably already own a second guitar.
4851353	4854355	You probably don't need a third guitar, so maybe.
4854675	4857837	And DarkTetsuya says the mandatory in Sky.
4857877	4859218	How about Guitar Hero Journey?
4859818	4860539	You know I'm down with that.
4860579	4861179	By the way.
4861239	4862460	Rob's not going to stop believing.
4862600	4863201	Did you hear?
4863261	4863981	I'm not stopping believing.
4864001	4865802	Did you hear the Journey is going to be in town?
4866243	4866703	Where are they?
4866883	4867563	With heart.
4868144	4868344	What?
4868564	4869245	And cheap trick.
4869385	4869625	When?
4870145	4871066	Like soon.
4871926	4872707	We're going, right?
4872807	4873167	I don't know.
4873307	4874768	It might be the same weekend as PAX.
4874848	4875529	I have to look it up.
4876289	4876870	I'll find out.
4877711	4878172	I'll look it up.
4880435	4881937	I'll look it up while we read a story.
4882458	4886123	Dude, if there's one thing better than journey, it's heart and journey.
4887145	4887966	It's heart.
4888867	4889388	I don't care.
4890610	4892513	As long as I get my power ballads, I'm happy.
4893544	4895345	SSJ100Matt says Guitar Hero ABBA.
4895685	4898126	No, that's for my dream pop and music game.
4898246	4900467	That would be like Keyboard Mania.
4901467	4903508	Anyhow, sorry, let's move on.
4904208	4904788	Yes, shall we?
4905148	4908510	Rock Revolution set list was released this week.
4909730	4910611	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4931109	4931409	DarkSakura,
4948956	4950577	Queen was Stone Cold Crazy.
4950857	4951337	I love that song.
4951397	4954519	We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister, which, you know, that's the Twisted Sister song.
4954539	4955420	So this is Butt Rock's version.
4955740	4956620	Kinda, in a way.
4956660	4959542	I mean, it has Blitzkrieg Bop by the Ramones.
4959582	4962503	That's the one they failed famously on stage at E3.
4963104	4963784	Am I Evil?
4965225	4966906	Bad Reputation by Joan Jett.
4967446	4970448	And just to top it off for fun, Sk8er Boi by Avril Lavigne.
4971624	4972064	There you go.
4972284	4973005	And Linkin Park.
4974005	4975406	So it's not totally butt rock.
4975426	4976086	All the small things.
4977167	4982289	To go back to the non-gaming related stuff we were talking about just earlier.
4982709	4984550	Journey with Heart and Cheap Trick.
4985230	4986011	You were close.
4986431	4989893	It is the 27th of September.
4991113	4991513	We're going.
4991553	4991934	We can go.
4992694	4993214	We are down.
4993254	4996256	It's at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.
4996276	4996976	Guess what else is.
4997056	4997736	Mountain View?
4999597	5006183	No, there's one in SAC too, whatever they call it, Sleep Train or SAC Valley, they change the name of it every year.
5007083	5008645	But next month also is Weird Al.
5009405	5010026	That's pretty cool.
5010186	5010706	At the fair.
5011347	5013309	You know, I've never seen Weird Al live before.
5013349	5014029	You're coming with us.
5014610	5016651	Maybe we should do OLR live at the Journey concert.
5016732	5017352	Let's do that!
5017372	5018473	Oh my god, that would be fantastic.
5018593	5020234	I don't know if it's possible.
5020254	5021015	We'll find a way.
5021055	5022276	We'll go record in the bathroom.
5022316	5024237	Concord Pavilion, the 24th.
5024437	5025958	I know they're coming to Sleep Train Amphitheater.
5025978	5026359	Look it up.
5026399	5027520	Look up the Sac Valley thing.
5027900	5028580	I'll look it up later.
5028620	5029521	So, can I do my story?
5029541	5032103	Yes, Jamie, just do your story and I will look up Journey and Heart.
5032606	5038569	So they're not as, you know, didn't go through their massive 80s-tastic mode because Ozzy always rocks.
5039049	5043492	But there is going to be Ozzy and Guitar Hero World Tour.
5046033	5048954	We actually have some tracks released today.
5049855	5053917	And the two Ozzy songs are going to be Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley.
5054977	5061641	Other tracks announced is Airborne, Too Much, Too Young, At the Drive-In, One-Armed Sister, Scissor, sorry.
5063021	5069284	Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Weapon of Choice, Bob Seger, Hollywood Knights, Dinosaur Jr., Field of Pain, I love Dinosaur Jr., I'm sorry.
5073646	5080449	We also have Silver Sun Pickups, Lazy Eye, System of a Down, BYOB, Survivor, Eye of the Tiger, Rob.
5082085	5083906	Sorry, I'm sitting here squeeing.
5083946	5085206	It's September 26th.
5085246	5085886	We're going!
5085926	5086247	Friday.
5086627	5087187	Friday night!
5087287	5087927	We're going!
5087987	5088487	We're going!
5088507	5089028	We're there!
5089148	5090268	That's the one in Wheatland, right?
5090428	5090648	Yeah.
5091388	5099191	Zach Wild, Stillborn, and other tracks that were previously announced, just to repeat those for the listeners.
5099451	5101392	Billy Idol, Rebel Yell, which I'm like, hell yeah.
5101832	5106414	Blink-182, Damn It, Foo Fighters, Everlong, which, you know, that's going to make Drew all...
5107654	5108975	It makes me all pee myself.
5109035	5109755	I love that song.
5110055	5110896	Foo Fighters are pretty awesome.
5110916	5111736	Some Jimi Hendrix songs.
5111776	5112636	That makes me happy.
5112716	5119799	Purple Haze, the live version, Wind Cries Mary, Linkin Park, What Have I Done, Paramore Misery Business, Sublime Santeria.
5120039	5121560	I'm going to yawn so bad for that one.
5122120	5123401	I'm so over Sublime.
5123481	5124701	Yeah, it's really overplayed.
5124761	5125922	The Doors, Love Me Two Times.
5126622	5127382	That's a good one.
5127722	5131044	The Eagles, Hotel California, and Van Halen, Hot for Teacher.
5132764	5137646	I'm sorry, I'm not the biggest fan of the David Lee Roth era, but I love Hot for Teacher.
5137807	5139427	That was a fun one.
5140428	5142369	I love When I Kissed a Teacher by ABBA.
5145110	5145630	Never mind.
5145790	5148952	Rob, you know I've got a present for you from Ranma at my house.
5148992	5149352	What's that?
5149732	5150712	I have an ABBA album.
5151073	5151433	Awesome.
5151553	5151893	Album.
5152313	5153894	Like old art and everything?
5154014	5154214	Yeah.
5154454	5156755	Maybe we can put that in the blank space on Justin.tv.
5156975	5158236	And he got you a Bette Midler album.
5158874	5161741	I'm not as big on Bette Miller, but my mother is, so I'll take that to her.
5161821	5162824	He got you Super Trooper.
5163485	5164027	Oh, awesome.
5164648	5165170	Anyway, sorry.
5165450	5165651	Yeah.
5166371	5188889	Orange Lounge, Abba O It's Abba Lounge Radio Loki, save the show, please Anyways, since we were talking about Rock Band earlier And I mentioned that we were going to be talking about street dates Well, the street dates apparently were leaked out of some database somewhere The dates that they have It wasn't you, was it?
5189150	5194034	It wasn't me I don't do that sort of thing Anymore
5197978	5224557	and he doesn't do it any less so according to this database which I think I want to say that it was like Fred Meyer or something like that maybe it was Blockbuster probably Blockbuster the 360 version they have coming out September 24th the PS3 October 19th and the Wii November 18th that is about half true
5229614	5230114	Oh, really?
5230874	5232315	It's not entirely correct.
5233035	5236836	Is there a certain element of that that might be incorrect?
5238616	5240536	The dates for those systems are correct.
5241216	5242857	They just don't mention one thing.
5244037	5251238	In September, the game-only version for Xbox 360 is coming out and the accessories are coming out by themselves.
5251759	5258040	The bundle's not coming out until the PS3 date, which is the same time the PS3 will be getting the standalone and the bundle.
5258880	5260961	That actually makes sense if they're rushing the game out.
5261081	5266204	And then the Wii version is coming out November 18th along with the PlayStation 2 version.
5267624	5268685	Hmm.
5269325	5269865	And now you know.
5270005	5272787	They were close, but not close enough.
5273707	5275468	They're probably going to give them the game only version.
5276249	5277769	What about the achievements and trophies in the game?
5278290	5281991	Well, the achievements and trophies are going to be very similar to the last game.
5282752	5284653	They have trophies for...
5285680	5286340	Thank you for watching!
5315089	5318511	and then of course they have some drum challenge achievements and stuff like that.
5318551	5319891	It looks very similar to the first game.
5320151	5328315	Hopefully, now that Band Tour is supposed to be online playable, so I can play it with friends of mine and not have to have everybody over, I'll actually be able to unlock some of those achievements.
5328635	5328815	Yeah.
5329035	5332056	Because I don't have the full thing, so I've never got those achievements, which is sad.
5332077	5336639	I'm counting on my friend who plays Rock Band a lot more than I do to play my copy and get me the achievements.
5337059	5337679	I'll play it with you.
5337799	5339920	You should come over one day and we'll get all those achievements.
5340840	5342581	I need to get that kick-ass drum set.
5342601	5343742	You just have to learn how to drum.
5343982	5344382	Exactly.
5345580	5348502	Alright, well, onto a completely different note.
5348942	5353365	This has nothing to do with music games whatsoever, although you might say these two are making music together.
5354146	5357828	This is from a post on these forums, MMORPG.com.
5358168	5372298	They're talking about the game Age of Conan, and this user, I don't know if the user themselves did it, I don't think they did, but they're posting screenshots from the Age of Conan game, where apparently, one of these players, who plays a male character in the game, uh...
5372898	5374159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5394019	5398342	Yeah, unfortunately if we did that, who knows what PSA we would receive next week.
5398622	5404346	Well, okay, they posted these screenshots here, and apparently they were cybering a little bit with the GM.
5404886	5409249	And look, here's some of the quotes from here.
5409510	5414433	The player, with dual-wheeled barbarians though, I mean, two, that's a bit difficult for me to handle.
5414493	5416134	I'd rather stick with one big sword.
5416434	5418396	And the GM says, you like it rough, I take it.
5420208	5421669	The player says, be gentle.
5422089	5424711	The GM says, are you a real woman?
5425071	5426392	LOL, not crazy question.
5426412	5427352	You would be surprised.
5427712	5431835	And the player says, yep, I just play a male character so guys don't flirt with me in game like on WoW.
5432595	5435176	And the GM says, I'm wearing panties.
5435397	5435717	Joke.
5437626	5438507	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5465831	5467793	The GM ends up saying, hmm, you are bad.
5467853	5471156	What if I rip your panties off and fuck you hard until I'm satisfied?
5472597	5477862	Want to feel you get really... Wait, want to feel... This is, of course, cyber chat, so the grammar is all horrible.
5478502	5488191	Want to feel you get really wee so I can put it just the head of my you-know-what inside you and use my hand to slowly move it around before plunging it fully into you and making you take it all.
5488892	5489292	Wow!
5490532	5492193	I mean, that's a GM in the game.
5492713	5495114	As you can probably imagine, this guy got canned.
5495134	5498676	But here's the part that's kind of irritating.
5499656	5501397	So the whole thing was a big joke.
5501557	5505059	The player then suddenly yells, this is Sparta.
5506019	5508581	You're so kinky, you just cybered with a dude.
5509301	5513183	And then the GM says, LOL, why did you want this then?
5513243	5513943	Are you gay?
5514303	5515104	Are you serious?
5515184	5517065	And then the player says, serious about what?
5518126	5521291	I was joking about the fapping, but then I am indeed the dude.
5521632	5525037	And the GM says, LOL, okay, glad I put my clothes back on.
5525498	5529285	And then the player says, yeah, probably a good idea, I have AIDS.
5533700	5541502	You had me going here at the lulzy factor, but then this is the equivalent of me getting up on stage and telling this hilarious joke.
5541562	5548164	Imagine I'm Ellen DeGeneres, and I come out on stage, and I'm really funny, and everybody's laughing, and I'm making jokes at people's expenses.
5548444	5553845	And then at the very end of my show, I take my pants off, and I poop live on stage.
5554105	5556026	That's kind of what happened here.
5556986	5559887	LOL, you had to end it with the ha-ha gay AIDS joke.
5561876	5562437	You suck.
5563638	5564759	And it's not funny.
5565079	5569645	And this poor guy probably got fired over what you did and posting all these things on the internet.
5570045	5573188	And if you wanted to be funny, that wasn't the way to go about doing it.
5573569	5575331	So you can suck it.
5575871	5577213	And you make me very angry.
5577413	5578915	And therefore, we're going to do the FUs of the week.
5580563	5580863	Oh, I'm sorry.
5580883	5581944	Do you have a comment, DarkSakura?
5581964	5582585	I do have a comment.
5582685	5583105	Oh, go ahead.
5583145	5583345	Sorry.
5583846	5590051	First of all, though, that's a big pile of mutual stupidity, so I don't feel sorry for either of them.
5590251	5592253	The GM's no dumber than you are, my friend.
5593874	5594275	Not you.
5594555	5596437	I know I'm looking at you, but I mean the user.
5597608	5624971	the user first of all is an asshole and also pretty much dumb fuck for the little comment at the end but the GM should have been a GM in the first place if you know they were going to basically act inappropriately especially if it's like a private server that's one thing but if this is a public server where someone is technically as an employee for said company they are a representative of the company they should know better
5625852	5626372	Exactly.
5626993	5630554	Amaze Satsuma in chat says, Pooping on stage is still better than Carrot Top.
5632595	5632835	Yeah.
5633435	5635096	Look, you get my analogy, alright?
5635956	5637376	Even if you have to be a smartass about it.
5637657	5639117	Alright, now, I'm still angsty.
5639337	5640618	I still have enough residual angst.
5641638	5643759	Hopefully DarkSakura does too to the FUs of the week.
5655551	5658514	My FU of the week goes towards a hormone.
5658854	5659194	That's it.
5660756	5661597	Damn those hormones.
5661797	5662117	Loki.
5662998	5666122	My FU of the week goes to my high school reunion.
5666222	5667783	The 10 year high school reunion.
5668063	5671147	What a complete fucking waste of time and money.
5672355	5679959	Just a note for all you people maybe still in high school and thinking, hey, 10 years from now I can go see all my friends again.
5680079	5681260	Don't do it, seriously.
5681460	5686002	I mean, about 30 or 40 people will show up and they're probably the people that you weren't friends with anyways.
5686102	5687883	Just keep in touch with your friends.
5691142	5693423	Me, myself, I don't really have a whole lot of FUs of the week.
5693663	5694724	I had a fairly decent week.
5694764	5696224	If I kick you, will you have an FU?
5696985	5697525	Yes, I will.
5697565	5698826	I will have an FU.
5699586	5700406	FU to the ferret.
5700806	5701207	It stings.
5701567	5705709	No, I know I had a bad... FU to drama.
5706069	5706829	We'll leave it at that.
5707209	5709771	Because there has been drama recently and it's no fun at all.
5710231	5711071	Drama is poopy.
5711631	5712312	Drama is poopy.
5712332	5713212	Drama is no fun.
5713232	5714553	Save the drama for your llama.
5714753	5715653	A gun is no fun.
5717454	5719435	I have a character on WoW called Drama Llama.
5720054	5721154	Guns are lots of fun.
5722495	5724555	Guns are fun unless you're shooting people with guns.
5724575	5725175	Then they're not fun.
5726496	5728376	But shooting cats with guns is hilarious.
5728436	5728856	No, I'm kidding.
5728896	5729556	Don't do that.
5729596	5730577	It's not funny.
5730737	5732677	I believe that everyone should have a gun.
5734237	5735398	I'm serious.
5736198	5737398	I'm completely in the opposite.
5737418	5738739	Here we go in the political stuff again.
5739099	5741859	I'm going to say one thing about that.
5742619	5744640	Promise me we can get back to gaming after that.
5746380	5748881	Do you think that most people are good?
5750194	5750875	Most people.
5751375	5761002	If everybody had a gun, a concealed weapon, whether they carried it or not, do you think that someone would be more likely to do a violent crime on someone who may or may not be armed?
5763364	5764985	I don't want the responsibility that comes with a gun.
5765305	5767107	You don't have to have it.
5767247	5769769	I don't trust the 1% of people who shouldn't have guns.
5770609	5775011	But do you think that 1% of the population is going to be stupid enough to attack the rest of the population who might be armed?
5775231	5775572	I don't know.
5775792	5776052	I don't know.
5776092	5776772	It shouldn't have to come to that.
5776792	5778773	That's all I ever have to tell anyone to think about it.
5778793	5779514	It shouldn't have to come to that.
5779554	5779774	All right.
5780034	5780274	Okay.
5780654	5781235	I'm thinking.
5781655	5781775	Ow.
5782855	5783756	Oh, don't hurt yourself.
5785357	5786698	There's other people to hurt you for you.
5787918	5795002	Anyway, well, you know one of my favorite games ever is a Hudson game.
5796617	5797298	Star Parodia
5818274	5821396	Well, we didn't get East Book 1 and 2 when it was supposed to be out.
5821956	5825638	But Star Parodia and Break-In are going to be on Virtual Console.
5826358	5832040	And I know I've mentioned this plenty of times before, Star Parodia is a parody of Star Soldier.
5833921	5845646	And it's a game where you basically, you can play as the Twinbee, you can play as Bomberman, or you can play as a flying PC engine and shoot things with hue cards and CDs.
5846026	5846947	And that is awesome.
5847779	5849661	Guns That Shoot Hue Cards I approve of.
5850061	5850522	Hell yeah.
5851142	5851823	Okay, but I'm done.
5853144	5853324	Cool.
5853544	5854966	Well, hopefully those games actually come out.
5855706	5862493	Because I've never played this Star Parodia game, and I always hear DarkSakura rave about it, so I'm kind of curious to check it out someday.
5862933	5864114	Yeah.
5864134	5864174	Um...
5865313	5866874	Thank you for watching!
5882185	5882745	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5897837	5916345	And it's now called Mushroom Kingdom Fusion And it's got 12 playable characters now You can actually play as Arthur from Ghouls N' Ghosts You can play as Sonic, Tails, Luigi, Wario, Kirby, Zelda Or I should say Link, Samus, etc.
5916485	5916805	Tingle?
5917765	5918586	No Tingle Fail
5919962	5922604	But they have all sorts of game references in this.
5922864	5924365	A bunch of different custom levels.
5924505	5925506	It's all fan-made.
5926246	5927487	A bunch of different power-ups.
5927567	5928768	It's fan-gasmed the game.
5929308	5929809	Pretty much.
5929929	5941436	You can actually download the beta of this, which I have still yet to get to run on my PC because it's very un... I don't know.
5943249	5943789	Thanks for watching!
5961295	5975187	Power-ups you can get, including for example, if you get the Mega Man power-up, if you're playing Mario, Mario becomes Mega Mario, Luigi becomes Proto Luigi, Sonic becomes Quick Man, and Tails becomes Gyro Man Tails.

6003202	6003422	What?
6003822	6004742	IPB.
6005282	6005922	IPB.
6006883	6007763	IPB Free.
6008343	6009203	So, alright.
6010924	6011804	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
6012644	6015605	Huh, I'll have to check this game out when they fix some of their memory problems.
6015665	6019826	It sounds interesting, but it sounds like what would happen if the fans made Super Smash Bros.
6021124	6021924	That's what would happen.
6023125	6024665	Hey, talk about legitimate games though.
6024685	6027186	This one's legitimate and something the fanboys definitely want.
6027747	6030768	Raiden 4 is going to be coming out for the Xbox 360.
6030848	6034249	That has been announced by Moss, who is the developer of Raiden 4.
6034309	6042372	They are porting the old arcade shoot-em-up to the Xbox 360 and apparently they're actually going to put new aircrafts in the game through download content.
6042933	6045053	The game comes out September 11th in Japan.
6045413	6048815	The game's soundtrack is supposed to be included with the game as well, so that's pretty cool.
6049315	6051976	DarkSakura will read those few emails we did get this week right now
6083206	6085887	First email is from GS68.
6086428	6096513	Hey, OLR crew, about the issue of Wii storage space, I'm not sure if this has been brought up yet, but can't you put VC games on an SD card and then put them back on your Wii when you want to play them again?
6097113	6098414	Is there something wrong with that?
6098754	6104217	Not saying you're dumbasses or anything, just wondering why you can't transfer your VC games onto an SD card.
6104557	6106438	Does that take too long or is it too inconvenient?
6106999	6107319	P.S.
6107339	6110821	This email was brought to you by JustinTV, home of the never-ending spammers and assholes.
6112006	6113728	Yes, on the it's too inconvenient part.
6113788	6119113	It's a little silly that your Wii can read from it, but yet it can't read data from it and access games.
6119133	6121115	It's like not being able to run a picture.
6121395	6121915	Imagine this.
6121996	6127060	Every time you wanted to look at pictures on a USB card, you had to copy them to your computer to view them.
6127120	6128802	You couldn't view them right off your USB card.
6128842	6129503	That's kind of annoying.
6129863	6130283	You know what I mean?
6131260	6133181	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6152262	6165273	If I wanted to play them, you know, later on, like, you know, like, for example, if I was playing, like, a lot of Alien Crush, I wouldn't move Alien Crush off there, but if, say, I played through, you know, what's another one on there, Blaster Master, and was kind of tired of it.
6165333	6166714	Not yet, but someday.
6166774	6168776	I'm just picking, I think, arbitrary title.
6168896	6169256	Sure, sure.
6169296	6178264	You know, so that would be the case that I think that that could be okay, but if it's, if you're, but not in a,
6179867	6183108	I just want to, you know, do this every time with every game.
6184128	6185649	Alpha Cananagram has a good point.
6185749	6189630	He says it just takes too long to copy back on the Wii, especially Nintendo 64 games.
6190090	6190870	Oh, that's a good point.
6191290	6191510	Mm-hmm.
6192450	6197552	God, I wonder how those TurboGrafx CD games would be.
6198172	6198552	Don't know.
6198892	6199172	Don't know.
6199532	6201373	It's just a little silly it's not supported yet.
6201413	6206014	I don't know if the slot access is too slow, but it's just, it's the principle.
6208668	6209188	Next email.
6210009	6210969	This is from Saltech.
6211810	6212611	Hey, OLR.
6213051	6216133	I just wanted to point out one thing the R4 has done for Nintendo.
6216474	6221157	Out of the five people I know who own DSs, four of them bought it only because of the R4, myself included.
6221598	6226401	Nintendo is going to make money because the R4 since they make money on every DS sold.
6228763	6237908	where it is really bad for the third party developers because people will not be purchasing those games which is unfortunate but happens when devices like this are released.
6238388	6241770	Keep up the great work and I apologize if my grammar sucks but I'm very bad at writing.
6241890	6242270	Saltech.
6242731	6243591	That's okay, I forgive you.
6244451	6244972	This time.
6245629	6247490	To be honest, I think you're kind of in the minority, though.
6247530	6255334	You and your friends are probably kind of a group of hackers, in the sense that you enjoy these types of things in the systems.
6255374	6258376	You probably also bought a PSP so you could play NES games on it.
6258416	6259056	I could be wrong.
6259456	6265800	But do realize you and your friends are not the mass gamer, if that makes sense.
6266480	6268321	I'm not saying I disagree with you.
6268361	6272603	I'm just saying you can't say that four out of all five gamers only bought a DS for the R4.
6272663	6273163	That's the thing.
6273763	6274723	That's the only point I'm trying to make.
6275024	6277665	But I don't think the R4 is a bad device when used appropriately.
6277825	6280406	I am all for breaking region locks.
6280666	6281426	I am all for that.
6282607	6290310	Well, the next and last email I should say, I'm actually going to be kind and check and see if there's one more email because I am kind.
6294912	6295832	Actually, we did get one.
6297094	6317015	OLR, I was checking to see if OLR has any events or special guests for the 300th show and if there's any room in the studio slash garage I would like to attend pending travel arrangements slash work here is some of the reasons which can earn me a spot in the studio as an attendee slash guest this person is very fond of slashes
6318176	6332673	having met DarkSakura must meet Sky and Loki to complete meeting the trifecta of OLR hosts gave DMN a ride home 35 miles from the arcade somehow triggering the random chain of events which would include DarkSakura paying for one of my games of DDR the following month
6335530	6336371	I play DDR.
6337231	6340632	I am probably one of the oldest skilled DDR players.
6340672	6343413	I've just turned 31 and I can keep up with people nearly half my age.
6344633	6350736	This one, great scene, close pick, On My Summer Love is an indication I might have to see OLR Live in order to AAA that song.
6352776	6355657	I have DDR Player as my license plate on my car.
6356057	6357218	I must pay tribute to the fairy.
6358338	6364745	Those are just a few reasons to be there during the 300th show in some form or another, LOL.
6365286	6372934	This email was brought to you by Olive Garden, home of the never-ending Olive Garden insert contextual question mark pound 78 dot track dot google dot com.
6373715	6375557	Peace out and triple A, Jammer J.
6377165	6379627	I'm going to be honest, I haven't even thought about the 300th episode yet.
6379667	6380608	It's still two months off.
6381149	6382490	There's packs kind of in the way.
6384051	6384792	It's going to be a little while.
6385513	6386674	Yeah, I saw the pictures.
6387875	6391378	You, my friend, are a DDR fan if I've ever seen one.
6392980	6393340	I don't know.
6394041	6395162	It's a big question mark right now.
6395202	6395522	We'll see.
6395562	6396122	More to come.
6396403	6397904	What do you guys want to see for the 300th episode?
6397924	6399806	Wow, what a nice perfect attack on my summer love.
6400373	6402414	What do you guys want to see us do for our 300th episode?
6402634	6402994	I don't know.
6403194	6404935	I want pizza and beer and ice cream.
6405275	6405635	We'll see.
6406355	6409897	I want to go back real quick because I'm an idiot and I got called out on it in chat.
6409917	6413318	GameGuru says the DS has no region lock and I should know that.
6413358	6417239	I've seen the import games for sale right on the store shelves next to the American games.
6417579	6418720	I don't know what the hell I was smoking.
6419740	6422482	I'll be honest, I don't use the DS a lot for region locks.
6422942	6425984	It's more for the PlayStation games where I'd like to get around it.
6426704	6429926	And I'm thinking, I've played Owen Don on my DS, I should know better.
6430546	6431067	But anyhow.
6432267	6433768	I have Owen Don on my DS.
6433808	6434749	I bought puppies from him.
6436641	6442003	So, sorry, anyway, as far as the 300th episode, to be determined, don't know.
6442584	6446826	We're always welcoming of other people in the studio, but, you know, just try to give us a little advance warning.
6447226	6450367	Plus, I would, honestly, you really want to come out here just for the show?
6451048	6458051	I mean, if you're going to go to San Francisco and do some tourism around there, cool, but it ain't worth it to fly out here just for our little thing.
6458071	6459091	You can call in on Skype.
6460452	6464654	I mean, I'm not trying to, you know, just being honest, we're not that exciting people.
6465965	6466785	We're simple people.
6467065	6468086	We're like Amish people, right?
6468206	6469186	DarkSakura with video games.
6470386	6473727	Are we video game-ish?
6474667	6475667	Video game Amish?
6475867	6476607	Video game Amish?
6476968	6477588	One more email!
6477628	6479388	Because someone snuck in.
6479548	6480328	Comments from chat.
6480448	6483709	Actdeft says episode 300 should be on Mexico, tequila, tacos, and more.
6484369	6489150	JVMons, and he is from Mexico, so he can try to lobby us to get there just like JVMons is doing.
6489490	6491171	Episode 300 should be in New York City.
6492772	6494773	Frisbee says, Episode 300 should be in space.
6495194	6497155	Look, I said things we can realistically do.
6497215	6499878	I think OLR in space is not going to happen.
6501299	6502360	I like the ring of that.
6502940	6503220	Nice.
6504001	6505302	OLR in space.
6505362	6506003	Alright, one more email.
6507711	6520107	Okay, last one says, Hi folks, since I just got an Xbox 360 Elite on August 2nd, I have some questions for you, mainly directed at Rob, since I know he has a 360, but Loki and DarkSakura can feel free to chime in too.
6520487	6523331	Oh, well, thank you so much for your permission.
6523491	6525414	I know, it's nice that the listeners give you permission.
6527606	6537277	1.
6527966	6537277	For those in my situation where we both have the PS3 and a 360, is it worth getting the same multi-platform games over again if we already have the given game on one of the consoles?
6537677	6540640	For example, Call of Duty 4, Rock Band, etc.
6540660	6541381	Nah.
6541782	6542002	Nah.
6542907	6543107	No.
6543688	6545649	If you must, sell your other one back.
6545830	6548872	At least get some credit for it before you buy the other one.
6548912	6549953	If you feel you must.
6550794	6555357	This is how some games try to milk money out of you, though, is by trying to entice you to buy it again.
6555398	6558020	Like Soul Calibur 4, the whole Vader-Yoda thing.
6560101	6564685	Although, I liked your theory about buying that other game to get both unlocked.
6564885	6565666	It's very likely.
6568088	6569329	My simple answer is no.
6569489	6570050	I'll ask him.
6571963	6574966	Rarely is that type of thing worth it.
6575026	6578510	Sometimes the game might really have a lot extra when it comes out on the other console.
6578570	6588680	It sounds like Bioshock might have, but even then I would want to sell my Bioshock on 360 back if I'm going to get it on PlayStation 3, which is actually not something I would do in the real world, but at least do that.
6590134	6592736	Well, moving right along to the next question.
6593316	6598780	If you could come up with a top five list of games for a 360 owner should have, what games would those be?
6598860	6602682	If you like, you can have separate lists for disc-based games and Xbox Live arcade games.
6603223	6606405	I'm going to go ahead and tell you a few that I have.
6606565	6608926	First of all, get Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
6609507	6611128	I love the hell out of that game.
6611608	6612889	And the second one's coming out, too.
6613902	6614802	It's lots of fun.
6615663	6618403	Dead Rising, you can kill zombies with a lawnmower.
6618804	6620264	That's fun for five seconds.
6622385	6624585	Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live Arcade.
6624605	6627346	Who knows?
6629266	6630247	What else was it that we were playing?
6634835	6634935	Rez
6650794	6653755	Symphony of the Night if you don't already have access to it on PlayStation.
6653815	6660478	If you do, go Luminous if you've never played it before and you haven't gotten it on any other console like the PSP.
6660498	6669362	Yeah, I would say something like Uno or go try something a little different like Catan or Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride.
6669522	6671022	Try one of those games on for size.
6671903	6672663	But don't get Yaris.
6673664	6675064	Yeah, don't be enticed by it.
6675084	6675924	It's free.
6676065	6676845	Same with Totem Ball.
6678746	6681147	Any contribution, Loki?
6683227	6683707	I'm sorry.
6683747	6688429	I'm being distracted by people saying that I need to be in a Tingle suit for the 300th show.
6688629	6689469	Silly chat room.
6689969	6690729	That ain't happening.
6690770	6694030	Recommend five Xbox 360 games our new listeners should pick up.
6694811	6695691	Or Xbox Live Arcade.
6695931	6697231	When are they picking up their 360?
6697291	6697932	They already have it.
6697992	6698572	They already have it.
6698612	6700432	Okay.
6701273	6701713	Let's see.
6701733	6705554	I would do Earth Defense Force 2017.
6708058	6709319	Hey, it's dirt cheap now, seriously.
6709699	6711240	It's like five bucks or something.
6711260	6712600	Alright, alright.
6714341	6717163	Crackdown, if you want, I mean, because that's dirt cheap right now, too.
6717223	6717803	The jumping game.
6719884	6721765	I would say the original Saints Row, if you want.
6721785	6725447	I mean, if you... I guess that's also dirt cheap.
6725768	6729710	I agree with JV Mon, who's flooding Lost Odyssey, if you're remotely interested in RPGs.
6731070	6731411	I guess.
6731451	6736794	There's a lot of RPGs coming out, though, pretty soon, so... Lost Odyssey, I guess.
6737274	6737374	Um...
6740410	6747072	Bioshock's good and probably OMG Halo 3.
6747392	6747872	Let's move on.
6750553	6751533	I would not recommend Halo 3.
6751733	6752313	Call of Duty 4.
6753313	6753593	Alright.
6755394	6755734	Was that it?
6755754	6756234	No.
6756414	6756674	Alright.
6756734	6756954	More.
6757454	6757714	More.
6759415	6759735	Anyway.
6760785	6765106	Moving forward, have you had any issues with any other players in Xbox Live?
6765186	6767367	People essentially being annoying or all around a-holes.
6767827	6769587	If so, what's the best way to deal with that issue?
6769867	6770788	Don't play with strangers.
6771068	6771828	Don't play with strangers.
6772468	6774049	Build up a friends list of good people.
6774589	6777749	And I urge you to start on OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash forums.
6778290	6783231	And if that's not enough for you, go visit other forums that you like and get other Xbox Live gamer tags.
6783571	6784471	And don't play with strangers.
6784511	6785031	Play with friends.
6785472	6787172	That's the only way you're going to avoid idiocy.
6787352	6791934	or make sure that you can play in a game where you make sure you start the game and you can boot the players.
6792394	6793394	That's another good tip.
6793414	6794635	If you want to meet people.
6794675	6795755	That's actually a very good tip.
6796535	6799136	Also, play games that idiots don't understand.
6799396	6801737	That's one reason I recommended Catan and Carcassonne.
6801757	6802918	Play games that idiots don't understand.
6802938	6805719	Learn to laugh at the idiots instead of being offended by them.
6805999	6811041	We did that one time when we played a bunch of people in the UK at Grand Theft Auto 4 and we kicked crap out of them.
6811081	6811501	They were like
6811901	6814382	It was about all these obscenities, and it was funny.
6814422	6816562	We were just like, ah, they're angry.
6817022	6818363	They're swearing with an accent.
6818423	6819043	Ha, ha, ha.
6819363	6819923	Exactly.
6819983	6821684	They're using words like, you know.
6822184	6823184	Oh, God.
6824424	6826365	I just have to say, chat room reminded, orange box.
6826745	6828486	None of us said orange box, and we really should have.
6828506	6829646	Yeah, you need portal.
6830126	6830806	All right, sorry, go ahead.
6830946	6837308	But I was also going to say, it just goes back to what was it I was saying a few weeks ago, learn to be offended?
6839406	6840386	I agree to an extent.
6840426	6842127	There's so much idiocy on Xbox Live though.
6842147	6843467	There's so, so much.
6843767	6844327	It gets old.
6844667	6846988	It's funny the first few times, it gets so old.
6847948	6850208	I report every single one because I'm that guy.
6852009	6853129	Last question on here.
6854509	6857730	If you don't mind, would you please send me a friends list invite on Xbox Live?
6858070	6860791	My gamertag is Spazinator on PSN.
6861771	6863292	Minus the quotes, obviously.
6864412	6865232	What about Xbox Live?
6866522	6868704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6888624	6892587	So, yeah, if anyone has, Dan's, isn't his Gunstar underscore hero?
6892607	6894189	Uh, I don't remember, to be honest.
6894229	6894569	I think so.
6894609	6907039	Yeah, Dan's his Gunstar hero, and he, um, boots people that he doesn't recognize, and so he's booted some people that I added on there, so if you add him and he boots you, don't be offended, it's not me, it's my husband.
6907159	6908080	Loki, are you full yet?
6909222	6910643	I think I have like 70-something.
6911163	6912403	So LokiOLR, right?
6912803	6914564	Loki space OLR, all caps.
6914724	6915845	There you go.
6916245	6920846	Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions as it's highly appreciated.
6920966	6921427	Take care.
6922207	6923087	That's a really nice letter.
6923127	6923467	Thank you.
6924708	6931030	I add everybody, but don't expect me to play with you during the middle of the day when I'm at work doing our two 15-minute multiplayer games.
6931991	6933011	We'll ignore your invites.
6934502	6940547	Yeah, don't... Just because... Yeah, that's another thing, because that's kind of happened lately, is that I'm... Without fail, I always get invited to games.
6940607	6945371	Please don't be offended if I turn them down, but keep in mind, sometimes when I turn on the Xbox, I have a game in mind I want to play.
6945871	6950755	I don't want to go back... Like, I don't even know where my copy of Halo 3 is, and I can't... Like, from several people, I get Halo 3 invites.
6951116	6952397	Please don't be offended when I decline them.
6952517	6954038	I just don't... That's not the game I feel like playing.
6954058	6954278	Yeah, same.
6954298	6959242	I get granted a lot of horror invites when I'm not playing it, and Nelly's playing, like, Zuma or Bejeweled, so...
6960003	6960244	DarkSakura,
6967325	6993136	but I do certain random things will happen like I got into a random Uno game the other night with some all games people and we had a good time not that I don't join random games every now and then I just haven't lately like right now it's all about Braid and Geometry Wars which sadly are not multiplayer so if you catch me in a good mood I can do Soul Calibur 4 if you catch me in a Soul Calibur mood anyhow, sorry was that it for Mailbag?
6993276	6994857	I think it was yeah
6995137	6996157	All right, so send us more.
6996218	6997738	Mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com.
6998098	7001060	SSJ100Matt in chat says, Dear Microsoft, expand the friends list count.
7001080	7001540	Okay, thanks.
7001680	7002000	I agree.
7002841	7003781	Loki, next story.
7004181	7014886	Well, I don't know if this is, like, you know, important or anything, but G4 has announced the winners of the G4IA 2008 Awards, which were voted on by the fans.
7015046	7016087	Who cares?
7017747	7019408	And here are the winners.
7019468	7020309	Game of the Year, Halo 3.
7022781	7024123	Why no love for Grand Theft Auto 4?
7024183	7024583	Seriously.
7025504	7027946	Favorite system, Xbox 360.
7028526	7030548	Best graphics, Metal Gear Solid 4.
7031409	7033971	Best new character, Nico Bellic from Grand Theft Auto 4.
7034071	7035492	Best party game, Rock Band.
7035532	7038314	Best strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution.

7071792	7073313	And then the awards were over!
7074014	7078538	I just saved you about three hours, or two hours, or however long this damn ceremony goes.
7080460	7082562	Jvmon says, Grand Theft Auto 4 kind of sucked.
7082822	7085464	He's in the minority, but Niko is the best video game character in a long time.
7086065	7093411	It's not that Grand Theft Auto was super duper awesome, because it was pretty awesome, but Halo 3 wasn't that awesome, let me put it that way.
7094012	7094692	I don't know, it wasn't...
7095566	7096166	Halo 3, New Paintjob
7126909	7127650	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7158392	7158972	It's pretty cool.
7159032	7162193	It's officially happening on the PlayStation Network on August 14th.
7163633	7173415	You can actually duel the creator of Eye of Judgment from Japan Studio if you are so lucky to in this game.
7173756	7180997	I don't know if they're actually doing a tournament-style thing or if this is one of those, hey, why doesn't everybody play this game online at the same time so there's lots of people playing?
7181337	7185118	I don't know exactly what it is, but it sounds like it could be interesting.
7186539	7187660	So, there you have it.
7187700	7190182	Play some Eye of Judgment on August 14th if you actually have it.
7191343	7197428	Well, even so, you've got more incentive to be able to play Eye of Judgment.
7197448	7200791	And this is great news for Loki, although it's probably not going to help at all.
7201892	7206936	Circuit City has Eye of Judgment and the PlayStation Eye for $40.
7207196	7209719	It's on sale!
7210679	7212721	And Walmart has it for $30.
7212761	7212861	Well...
7216141	7218021	Time to go buy those things off the shelves.
7218061	7218862	Let's start moving them.
7219222	7220742	I think I might actually go pick up one.
7221022	7221602	There you go.
7221682	7222783	That's one in a million.
7223183	7223883	Only $999,999 more to go.
7223963	7228364	If it's at Walmart for $30, hell yeah, I'll get it just to have the webcam.
7228404	7232545	It's a good price for the PlayStation Eye because I think the PlayStation Eye by itself is like $39.99.
7234466	7237646	Even I would pick it up just because someday I'll probably get a PlayStation 3.
7237907	7238967	I'd pick it up to burn it.
7240619	7244282	Well, I'd pick it up to have the webcam because you can use the webcam on your PC.
7244923	7246284	And it's better than the webcam I have now.
7246644	7250107	I don't use my webcam for anything other than taking random pictures, but, you know.
7250447	7254370	The webcam we use for OLRs, Justin TV, is an actual video camera at this point.
7254390	7255751	But we used to use an iRite.
7255771	7256712	We used to use an iSight.
7257192	7257472	That was it.
7257492	7258353	That's what we used to use.
7258373	7260034	And then it broke because I dropped it on the ground.
7260054	7261575	Before that, we used to use an iToy.
7262316	7264077	We did, for a little while, use an iToy.
7264097	7264838	Oh, man.
7265278	7266439	That was back in the day.
7268581	7269181	Good times.
7270362	7273944	So, lots of Eye of Judgment news around.
7274264	7275285	Aren't you excited, Loki?
7275985	7278607	I was the one that posted this story, so... I think they're desperate.
7279107	7281629	I'm well aware of what's going on in the Eye of Judgment world.
7283070	7286452	Or the lack thereof of what's going on in the Eye of Judgment world.
7286852	7290994	Well, something that's about as ridiculous as playing a card game over your PS3.
7291254	7293296	How about installing Windows Vista on your PS3?
7294750	7297171	Yeah, well, you can do it.
7297691	7299591	It doesn't really mean it's going to work well.
7299631	7309774	Basically, the guy installed a version of Linux on his other partition of his hard drive, and in Linux, emulated Windows Vista.
7311414	7318596	And, well, it takes 25 minutes to boot, and 5 minutes to access the start menu, and about 12 minutes to open Notepad.
7320266	7321707	12 minutes to open Notepad.
7321727	7323728	12 minutes to open Notepad.
7323788	7325208	Power the cell processor.
7325848	7326249	Wow.
7326649	7333311	No, but seriously, though, I mean, you're emulating an operating system within an operating system, within an operating system, basically.
7333672	7335933	Misty says my thoughts exactly in chat.
7335973	7338333	She says, ew, it's bad enough on PC.
7338554	7343256	And to be honest, you know, to be honest, Windows Vista just runs like that.
7343356	7346497	So, you know, really, stick with Linux.
7347711	7348531	There you have it.
7348711	7350032	Or Minty.
7350392	7351692	I almost said Misty Linux.
7351852	7352453	I bet you'd be excited.
7352473	7353253	Or Minty Linux.
7353613	7356774	Well, I don't know if you can install Minty Linux on a PS3.
7358115	7360575	I think it only takes Yellow Dog or something like that.
7361376	7362436	How about Misty Linux?
7362516	7364837	Would that be like an OLR-based Linux system?
7364857	7365597	Misty Linux?
7365637	7366257	Misty Linux.
7366797	7367738	Instead of Minty Linux.
7367798	7369118	It'd be like Emo Linux.
7369778	7371139	Oh, my eyes are misty.
7371799	7372099	No, no.
7372159	7373380	Like our listener Misty.
7373480	7373860	Not like...
7374620	7374980	I hate you.
7375000	7375401	Just kidding.
7398683	7401804	But I will like you a whole lot, Loki, if you get this for me.
7401865	7403125	It's LittleBigPlanet.
7403465	7406907	Of course, you'd have to buy me a PS3 as well, so get working on that, okay?
7407107	7417052	LittleBigPlanet, if you actually pre-order this game, it was revealed by the official US PlayStation blog that apparently there are five separate pre-order bonuses that you can get in North America.
7417412	7420013	It all depends on where you're going to reserve the game.
7420353	7425876	They haven't said where you reserve it will get you what prize just yet, but one of them is a
7426496	7427517	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7446010	7447271	That's awesome.
7447291	7449173	I'm going to pre-order a game and get a burlap sack.
7449193	7449613	That's rad.
7450113	7453275	A little big sticker book, which is a sticker book.
7453796	7459940	And the official LittleBigPlanet Creator guide by Brady Games, but only the mini guide.
7460040	7461981	It's the little guide for the little game.
7462922	7464883	I think it's kind of cute.
7465764	7466805	That is ugly.
7466885	7468586	I bet the Naughty Girl one's better.
7468606	7469446	It looks like a poop.
7469466	7470847	Your butt looks like a poop.
7475800	7476220	Thank you.
7476320	7478041	I'm not really too excited about the God of War.
7478061	7481182	I was looking at the one for the Heavenly Sword one.
7481222	7484743	Okay, the burlap sack is like a zipper pouch.
7486123	7486723	It's cute.
7487664	7492165	I would get the little big pouch or the Nariko if it doesn't look as hideous as the Kratos one.
7494246	7495706	The Heavenly Sword one is really cute.
7495726	7496487	She looks like a Fraggle.
7497407	7498527	Now, Fraggles are rad.
7500908	7502568	Do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?
7503049	7503869	Dude, they should.
7504828	7506590	Loki, do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?
7509212	7511734	Maybe on the ColecoVision or something like that.
7511774	7513495	Okay, they need a new Fraggle Rock game.
7513615	7518339	Well, you can wait for the remake of the Fraggle Rock movie.
7518679	7522422	They're going to do a remake, I guess, of it or something.
7522842	7524584	And then there'll be a video game coming out for it.
7526255	7529019	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7543106	7547567	Well, this is something that no one will ever be able to forget once they've heard of it.
7549488	7556490	There's a shooter series that stars heavily muscled men wearing Speedos.
7558710	7560311	It's the Cho Aineke games.
7560851	7563832	And there is going to be a new Cho Aineke game on PSP.
7564844	7565804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7585069	7589994	I know, but it's like, Uber Muscles and he's got like a little thingy over his, you know, pee-pee.
7590174	7593997	Did they wuss out on the, you know, subtle gay porn hints, though?
7594117	7595699	I don't think so at all.
7595879	7596319	Amen!
7597300	7602725	But, you know what, I told my husband in no uncertain terms that I'm importing Zero Cho Aniki.
7603086	7605228	And you should also tell him that you're gonna make him buy it.
7605888	7606589	I don't know, I told him.
7607350	7607590	Nice.
7609423	7614906	Also, my friend who introduced me to Linux Mint says no Mint on PS3 as of yet.
7614926	7615226	Sorry.
7616387	7616687	Darn.
7616707	7618248	I had to spread that on air.
7618588	7619468	Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.
7620149	7620589	That's all right.
7621589	7623150	GameGuru says, also, why?
7623290	7624391	Why, Choaniki?
7624471	7624711	Why?
7625495	7627256	Because Cho Aoniki is cool!
7627517	7632520	And GameGuru would like to also point out that the Fraggle Rock redo is coming from Jim Henson and Disney.
7632861	7633781	So hopefully that's a good sign.
7633801	7635182	It's coming from beyond the grave.
7635463	7636183	Exactly.
7636583	7637844	Thank God.
7638705	7644009	So there's a couple neat, I guess, mods that have come out for the PSP.
7644770	7650914	The first is actually someone that has basically put a cell phone inside of a PSP.
7652495	7656238	Where the UMD drive goes, and so now it's a PSP phone.
7657659	7657999	Awesome.
7660100	7664043	It kind of looks retarded, but hey, it's a phone and it's a PSP.
7664683	7666304	Something a little bit more functional, though.
7666324	7668226	Is there anything this device can't do?
7668966	7670427	Something a little bit more functional, though.
7670707	7675310	Another modder has incorporated a touchscreen to the PSP.
7675870	7677952	That's a little bit better, I would say.
7678912	7680533	And that project now is called...
7681474	7683295	The Touchscreen Project for the PSP.
7683575	7689099	It's on a website called PSPZ Project.
7690079	7696683	And .dcemu.co.uk And... I don't know.
7696703	7697164	It's kind of neat.
7697204	7697964	Dude, DCEMU.
7698024	7699145	I remember that site.
7699785	7703547	That was... My Dreamcast got more action from that website than any game.
7703667	7704108	Exactly.
7704128	7706449	Remember... Was it Feet of Fury?
7706769	7707290	Heck yeah.
7707310	7707350	Um...
7709969	7711570	So yeah, it's interesting.
7711831	7718456	Basically, he's allowed it to, I guess, have better battery life somehow.
7719136	7722359	They've redesigned the control pad and some other crap.
7722599	7725361	And he's working on a keyboard application for it.
7726022	7726302	I don't know.
7726322	7727162	I think that's pretty neat.
7728283	7735229	It would be kind of cool to have a touchscreen on the PSP because, for the love of God, typing on that thing sucks.
7737614	7740757	Alright, so wow, we've had Wii hacks and now PSP hacks.
7741378	7742499	The hackers sure are busy.
7745181	7749385	We're going to end tonight before we go to the Skype line with a story that I know is going to surprise you guys.
7749405	7751046	It's going to knock the socks off of you.
7751106	7754409	You're never going to believe it, but brace yourselves.
7754890	7757933	Grand Theft Auto 4 is coming to the PC, y'all.
7758956	7759896	What?!
7759956	7760656	Shock, huh?
7760896	7761837	I never would have guessed.
7762697	7763597	That is unheard of.
7763797	7767718	I never would have guessed, based on the 50 leaks that came out earlier.
7768098	7775620	Well, Rockstar finally admitting it, saying, quote, We are very excited to be releasing the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4.
7776000	7779581	The whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the PC.
7780001	7783842	The game looks and plays beautifully on PC, and we can't wait for people to play it.
7784603	7792012	It is coming out November 18th in North America November 21st in Europe There is a reason why this is following a story about hacking
7793231	7795032	Oh yeah, that is all I'm going to say.
7795713	7796853	That is all I'm going to say.
7797674	7798094	Have fun.
7798495	7800836	Just in time for Christmas for the hacking community.
7800916	7802717	Oh my god, it's going to be so awesome.
7803358	7807600	The other thing too that's kind of cool about it though is they do have some expanded multiplayer options in there as well.
7807921	7811263	No word on what that is exactly, but there are going to be some new multiplayer features.
7811623	7817327	Not that it would matter anyways because people would add it anyways and recreate all new cities and all sorts of mods.
7817527	7818868	I cannot wait.
7819568	7819949	Can't wait.
7820809	7821129	Awesome.
7821710	7824051	We're going to open up the Skype line now for your calls.
7824211	7831835	Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype or if you're feeling so inclined, you can pick up the phone 1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll-free number in the US and Canada.
7832235	7834836	Unfortunately, if you're overseas, you're going to want to stick to Skype.
7835276	7836577	We're not going to pay your phone bill, kids.
7836937	7837237	1-877-GAME-OLR
7860962	7861843	I got sold.
7861863	7862183	I'm sorry.
7863365	7867029	It didn't implode or go under like it closed completely.
7867109	7867369	No, no, no.
7867730	7870133	It's being sold as a property out of Turner.
7870513	7875900	So sorry if I misrepresented that, which is good that apparently the stream went down right at that moment that I said that.
7876160	7876481	Did it?
7876761	7879524	Yeah, it's back up now, but we had a weird hiccup in the connection.
7879745	7880085	How was it?
7881089	7882852	But anyway, yeah, because the chat room is going crazy.
7883352	7885676	But anyway, oh shoot, Justin TV caught me saying it.
7885996	7887739	But yeah, no, Turner sold it off.
7887759	7889561	He was looking to sell it off, apparently.
7890082	7891665	So, we'll see.
7893367	7895168	Any other last minute stories while we wait for some calls?
7895268	7898730	Again, since the stream went dead, 1-877-GAME-OLR, the skype line is open.
7898750	7901131	You want to hear something funny?
7901311	7901811	What, Loki?
7902071	7905093	I was reading up a little bit more on that Mushroom Kingdom fusion.
7905773	7907134	They've got a bunch of different levels.
7907154	7920640	They have the Mushroom Kingdom, Alternate Earth, Mega Man's Realm, the Demon Realm, which is based on Doom games, Genena, Shoot'em Up's domain, Realm of Nintendo, Sonic Universe, Halo Ring World, Twisted Reality, and Minus World.
7921101	7921261	But
7921881	7924944	In the demon world, the boss is Loki.
7927306	7928127	How appropriate.
7928407	7929408	Let's go to the Skype line.
7929448	7930329	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7930369	7930689	Who's this?
7931770	7932410	Legend of Zaku.
7932430	7932791	What's up?
7933311	7933812	Hey, Zaku.
7933832	7934332	What's on your mind?
7934392	7935133	Long time no talk.
7935153	7936294	What do you want to talk to us about tonight?
7937635	7938696	Just random things.
7938976	7940097	Let me see.
7941318	7944161	In fact, I'm just trying to find some stuff.
7946024	7949908	Yeah, that whole Madden hype, which apparently is affecting me and others.
7950469	7953892	How exactly do you make money off of Madden?
7953932	7954593	Through league play.
7970878	7975261	Are you talking online currency or are you talking about some type of shady... No, real money.
7975361	7978284	Real money through Madden.
7978684	7980345	He did that through NBA Live recently.
7981186	7986189	He and a bunch of other players basically did it through MLG or something like that.
7986369	7993094	I never realized there was this whole underground betting activity going on on Madden and video games.
7993594	7995636	How much money is your brother making off this?
7996468	7998650	Well, actually, it's the team that he's in.
7999831	8002253	He hasn't told me any specifics, but he did make a lot.
8002774	8004435	But most of the money is going to the team.
8004855	8006817	Well, what does the team buy?
8006957	8008439	Shirts or a whole lot of pot?
8009379	8011601	No, just to pay off their players, I guess.
8013723	8014324	Wait, I don't get it.
8015465	8017707	So then your brother is making money if he's paying off the players?
8020349	8023451	Well, he's actually in the league, so he's actually making money.
8023992	8029056	The earnings are split pretty much amongst all the other players in his team.
8029316	8036722	So if I get good at Madden, which will never happen, if I get good at Madden, I could make money off of it on this whole underground gambling circuit?
8037523	8038183	Yes, you could.
8038243	8040145	They do hold those things from what I hear.
8040205	8045349	They pretty much hold the underground Madden sessions where they have...
8047270	8055520	They bet big dollars for each game No, it's just at the private meetups Just like, you know, at people's houses where they just like, you know, they play Madden for money
8065075	8066136	Interesting.
8067178	8075727	I mean, I can't imagine any other game, maybe DDR, unless you put money on... Well, I don't see an underground DDR betting circle starting anytime soon.
8076328	8077329	I mean, it could happen.
8077369	8078010	Think about it.
8078811	8082195	You could basically put money on the number of greats you get per song.
8082904	8084726	Like the less number of greats, you know.
8101247	8110430	Um, besides Digital Life being held next month, coinciding with an anime convention also being held in the same place, that's pretty much it, you know.
8110870	8111871	Next month, Digital Life, $3,000.
8112031	8114612	What are you most looking forward to about Digital Life?
8114652	8116792	I know there was a little bit of disappointment all around last year.
8116832	8119753	What are you looking for them to most improve, or what are you looking forward to this year?
8120934	8121934	I have no idea.
8121974	8126936	I just want to, I don't know if there's, they have more, you know, they have more like game, you know,
8127546	8130868	Game developers showing up instead of all this other marketing crap.
8131769	8139514	I mean, besides all the swag that you get for free, you could use a few more games like in 06, which was really good.
8139534	8143236	They had the Wii and everything before it came out.
8144737	8144937	All right.
8144957	8150341	Well, Zaku, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks for calling in, and good luck to your brother.
8150361	8152542	I hope he can make your family a lot of money.
8153547	8154547	Yeah, I hope so, too.
8154868	8155348	I don't know.
8155988	8156968	Maybe you can ask for a loan.
8157148	8157889	All right, take care, buddy.
8159089	8159349	Bye.
8160590	8163051	Get a loan out to get some of that DDR crack or something.
8163931	8166632	Maybe if he wins enough money, he can get a 2DX machine for the house.
8166672	8167112	What do you think?
8167513	8168093	Sounds good, huh?
8169193	8171174	Would you ever bet on a video game real money?
8171594	8176436	I love gambling, but it ends at slot machines nickel size.
8177016	8178317	Rob, I don't play the lottery.
8180525	8185349	The only closest I've ever done to it is a lottery pool at work where I was only out $2.
8186489	8189752	Isn't that fascinating though that there's this whole betting on Madden circuit?
8189772	8191032	I think it's freaking sad.
8191153	8194155	It is in a way, but it's... I don't think gambling is fun.
8195279	8196000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8213188	8216290	For me, I'm willing to raise the stakes a little bit, like 20.
8217091	8219392	Most, I think I've ever gambled at night, it's like 60 bucks.
8219753	8223175	And I go, well, 60 bucks is what I might spend on a video game or spend, you know.
8223455	8224296	But I always set a limit.
8224456	8226778	I don't take my ATM card into those places because it's dangerous.
8227038	8229540	You go in with a set amount of money and you don't expect to walk out with it.
8229840	8231061	And then you're okay.
8231701	8233322	Anyway, not that I should be endorsing gambling.
8234163	8238406	But once in a while, it's not gonna... It's okay.
8238606	8239006	You know, you...
8240302	8242903	People know their tolerance is the best for themselves.
8244504	8245484	The Skype lines are open.
8245504	8246945	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8247025	8248566	Use name on Skype as Orange Launch Radio.
8248726	8252347	While we wait to see if we get any more calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us otherwise?
8252687	8254188	I'm still reading more of that wiki.
8254728	8257009	Actually, there's one thing here that's kind of funny.
8258010	8265753	On Machima.com, they have a video for... You know how they have all those meet the classes of characters in Team Fortress 2?
8265893	8266814	Well, they have Meet the Cow.
8268355	8275579	I guess it's some cardboard cow or some wood cutout cow that's in Team Fortress 2 and it's pretty funny.
8276840	8277720	Alright, we have another call.
8277760	8278721	Let's go to the phones.
8278761	8279702	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8279742	8280222	Who is this?
8281743	8284064	This is the one from Sweden.
8284725	8286106	Our Swedish friend.
8286706	8290288	I was hoping you'd call tonight with all the ABBA references we were making earlier in the show.
8290809	8292590	No, I'm just... What's that?
8293610	8295211	It wasn't about that, though, but...
8297045	8298566	That's alright, I'm just messing with you.
8298766	8299486	What's on your mind, buddy?
8302148	8309132	Well, the system specs for Age of Reckoning Warhammer has finally been released.
8309232	8313094	I don't know if you actually did mention it, but it has been released.
8313515	8314795	Tell us a little bit about it.
8316517	8322560	The system specs for Warhammer Online has been released, which is a basic single-core...
8324738	8336283	Pentium 4, 2.4, and mostly like a gig of RAM if you run AXP or Vista.
8336883	8338584	And if you're running Vista, you need two.
8339524	8345427	Other than that, you need an average modern video card, and you're ready to go.
8347888	8351489	That sounds like most anyone can run this if you have a modern PC.
8351529	8351689	Yeah.
8353749	8362273	since they're aiming for basically the WoW scale of players.
8364074	8381223	Even though I'm quite a bit surprised since, at least in my case, I'm running really on a, as current state, unfortunately a big low generation 7 GeForce card.
8381866	8383889	And that one isn't supported.
8384870	8397346	And the funny thing is that mostly low ATI cards are supported, but the NVIDIA ones are not.
8397665	8397905	Nah.
8424611	8425752	I'm not quitting Ragnarok.
8425792	8426852	All the cool kids are quitting their games.
8426872	8427553	I'm sorry, go ahead.
8451894	8461380	I'm not, pardon me, but I'm not that big a fan of a Star Trek geek, so I can't really say anything.
8461660	8480693	The only space science fiction MMO I played for a while was EVE Online, which, well, is sort of fun, even though if you're really out of breaking down on EVE, just on the EVE front, it's basically a big Excel spreadsheet, so...
8481972	8482312	Awesome.
8482512	8486435	Bobby Blackwolf says in chat right now, I want to join Rob's fleet in Star Trek Online.
8486455	8487496	Dude, I'm going to have a fleet.
8487876	8488717	That's going to be great.
8489217	8491558	Anyway, I want to be Captain Sassy Pants.
8494460	8494781	Anyway.
8495841	8498343	That would be awesome.
8498563	8500625	Captain Sassy Pants of the USS OLR.
8500885	8501465	Anyway, I'm sorry.
8501565	8502166	We're getting off track.
8502186	8504087	I know you didn't want to talk about Star Trek because you're not that big a geek.
8504467	8506589	Go ahead.
8506629	8506929	Go ahead.
8507749	8509130	Go ahead, finish your thought.
8509570	8516272	Other than that, I've had the opportunity to try out Age of Conan.
8517152	8523634	And, well, I'm not that impressed, really.
8523874	8526014	You didn't cyber with anyone in the game, did you?
8527055	8529515	No, I didn't.
8530476	8532576	It sounds like you didn't think it was too high.
8532836	8534017	What did you not enjoy about it?
8534397	8534937	What turned you off?
8536397	8543980	It really is the combat system that it's, well, it's weird.
8545101	8548262	Or maybe just I need to learn to play, really.
8551384	8554565	The combat system wasn't saved by the fact that you could lob people's heads off?
8556646	8559988	No, I didn't lob any heads off, I think.
8562409	8564650	But it might be also due to the following fact that I'm
8566128	8571100	My computer that I'm running Ejikonan on is really a lowest
8572165	8575888	Do you get a lot of the high end stuff as we get it here?
8575968	8577770	Or do you find that you guys lag behind a little bit?
8600194	8602596	No, we don't like behind at all.
8602856	8609721	It's just me that don't have the possibility to dish out.
8611142	8611562	No, I know.
8611802	8612683	We're poor here, too.
8612743	8613223	I'm poor.
8614003	8617606	Well, I am going to probably dish out the money because I did a second job recently.
8617666	8618066	That's all right.
8619948	8624711	Well, if you have the opportunity, you can...
8626356	8634743	It's really easy to dish out a few bucks, so you can get a respectable gaming system, so it's no problem at all.
8635644	8637445	Well, hey, we've got to let you go, buddy.
8637846	8641769	We're running out of time, but thanks so much for your call, as always, and letting us know how the weather is on the other side of the pond.
8642890	8643971	We appreciate it.
8644071	8644471	Take care, buddy.
8646098	8651363	Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line and take any other last minute stories we have here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8651803	8657768	We have something else we're trying to get to live tonight just for the live folks on allgames.com so anything else you guys have tonight?
8658349	8659450	I wish I could read German.
8660273	8661074	Thank you for watching.
8661114	8661674	See you next time.
8680146	8684767	It takes about 15 minutes to load, but it's supposedly worth it.
8685547	8686127	We're going to do it.
8686167	8687167	We're going to wrap up the show.
8687208	8688848	We're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
8688908	8689668	Loki, we'll start with you.
8689708	8690368	Your final thought.
8690728	8691528	I can't wait to play this game.
8692989	8694069	DarkSakura, your final thought.
8694669	8698530	Dude, we are so going to see Journey, Heart, and Cheap Trick.
8699230	8700450	That's freaking awesome.
8701551	8708292	And my final thought is I want to quote a Journey song, but not Don't Stop Believin'.
8710194	8712416	When the lights go down in the city.
8712536	8714277	When the lights go down.
8714317	8714898	All right, that'll work.
8714918	8716399	All right, have a good one, you guys.
8716419	8719181	Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting.
