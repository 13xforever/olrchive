7000	12000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco
14000	16000	Tonight, August 3rd, 2008
16000	19000	Will Nintendo's latest move in court stop DS piracy?
19000	22000	Is Jet Set Radio making a comeback on the Wii?
22000	27000	And rumors abound about the Xbox 360 getting a price cut next month
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	41000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture and the gamer lifestyle
41000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
47000	50000	Roar, roar, beware I hunger
50000	52000	No I'm not hunger
52000	54000	I'm full of tasty epic salad
54000	57000	So then we should not beware
57000	59000	We should beware
59000	61000	Beware of what?
61000	64000	Angst?
64000	69000	See it's even worse if I don't tell you what to beware of because then you're just like extra
69000	72000	I see then you're scary, you're like Silent Hill scary
72000	75000	Alright say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki
75000	76000	Hello
76000	77000	How you doing, Loki?
77000	78000	Good
78000	81000	Alright and I see you're drinking a milkshake right now
81000	84000	Yes it's one of those diet milkshakes from Jack in the Box
84000	86000	Wait it's a diet milkshake?
86000	90000	You know the milkshake diet, what they're not all like that?
90000	93000	No I don't think a milkshake is a part of a good diet so
93000	96000	Actually milkshakes can be very good for you if you do them right
96000	100000	Well I doubt Jack in the Box does them the healthy way, call it a hunch
100000	106000	Make them with no sugar added ice cream and protein powder and low fat milk
106000	108000	Then it's only half bad
108000	110000	It's very healthy, give good dairy
110000	112000	I just finished my nutrition class
112000	115000	Orange Lounge Foodio everybody, welcome to it
115000	120000	Anyhow let's talk about games and we always start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week
120000	122000	First though let me introduce the one and only chat room
122000	128000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com is the place to be if you're listening live on this Sunday evening August 3rd of 2008
128000	131000	For our 290th show if you can believe it
131000	135000	And old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio kind of back in the spotlight
135000	137000	I'll talk a little bit about that as we move on
137000	140000	But first we gotta talk about our gaming weeks, the types of games you've been playing
140000	142000	Dark soccer as always, start us off
142000	144000	We have Soul Calibur IV now
144000	148000	And I'm going to sit down and make characters tomorrow
148000	151000	I haven't had a chance to actually play it yet but we have it
151000	153000	Have you been watching it at all?
153000	155000	Ready? Yes?
155000	158000	Rob, this has been the last week of class
158000	160000	It's a fair question, yes or no?
160000	166000	No, this has been the last week of class for me so I actually took my final on Saturday morning and then played
166000	168000	I took a hooky day though
168000	169000	What did you do with hooky day?
169000	170000	Watched movies
170000	172000	But you didn't play Soul Calibur fail
172000	174000	No I didn't
174000	175000	I'm just kidding
175000	177000	But but but but but I did play some Portal
177000	179000	And how was that?
179000	180000	Portal-rific!
180000	181000	Alright
181000	183000	And of course Ragnarok
183000	184000	Ragnarok
184000	186000	I have a story just for you later tonight
186000	190000	I downloaded a game for my phone, I downloaded a Sudoku game
190000	192000	I've been playing Sudoku on my phone
192000	193000	Why?
193000	196000	How bored have you been on a scale of one to ten?
196000	197000	It's actually kind of fun
197000	199000	Keep in mind you can only use each number once
199000	201000	It's actually kind of fun
201000	203000	Just for something when you've got three minutes to kill and
203000	206000	Sudoku is a huge time waster
206000	209000	But like that's it, it's a time waster
209000	213000	If you're looking to waste time you know at least try to put your brain to work right?
213000	215000	I guess that's what most any game's for right?
215000	216000	I don't know
216000	217000	Alright
217000	219000	Well what about the show?
219000	220000	Hey wait a minute
220000	221000	Alright
221000	222000	Is that it for your gaming week?
222000	223000	Yes Rob
223000	225000	Tech Master Loki, how was your gaming week?
225000	226000	Um
226000	228000	I didn't play any of my games this week actually
228000	231000	I only played Grand Theft Auto IV
231000	234000	I meant to play a bunch of stuff this week but never got around to it
234000	237000	Grand Theft Auto IV and um
237000	241000	The Shit Game but we'll talk about that later
241000	243000	The Shit Game huh?
243000	244000	Yes
244000	246000	Now this isn't a game that is just shitty
246000	248000	It's actually The Shit Game
248000	249000	The Shit Game
249000	250000	Is it The Shit?
250000	251000	No it's Shitty
251000	252000	Okay
252000	253000	But it's so fun
253000	254000	Alright
254000	255000	It's so much fun
255000	256000	I wish it was longer
256000	257000	Alright
257000	260000	Well god I feel like I'm the only one that's actually played a lot of games this week
260000	261000	I have played quite a few games
261000	264000	I played Soul Calibur IV on the Xbox 360
264000	266000	Ran out and bought it the day it came out
266000	270000	I don't have a Playstation 3 so I had to get it on Xbox 360
270000	272000	I'm really enjoying the game
272000	274000	I'm having a lot of fun with it especially in single player mode
274000	276000	I love create a character mode
276000	278000	Granted I had fun with it in Soul Calibur III
278000	282000	But I don't know I like in this one getting to kind of edit the characters that are already there
282000	287000	Getting to you know make characters based off of the existing fighting styles
287000	291000	Because I'll tell you what it's really funny to have this chick with a giant afro
291000	294000	Doing Young Sung's move where she does the splits and everything
294000	295000	It's really funny to me
295000	300000	The only thing that kind of stinks is that you can't have the bonus characters
300000	304000	Yoda and Starkiller you can't use them or the apprentice as he's called in the game
304000	306000	Which makes them sound like a Donald Trump flunky
306000	308000	But Starkiller from The Force Unleashed
308000	311000	You can't customize characters based off of them which sucks
311000	313000	Because I would have loved to have made a
313000	315000	I can understand Yoda
315000	318000	Because you know it's kind of hard to base characters off Yoda
318000	320000	Unless you're going to have midget fighters
320000	322000	Which would be an awesome fighting game by the way
322000	326000	I was just thinking that you should totally make your Final Fantasy XI character
326000	328000	Lil' Kim in Soul Calibur
328000	331000	I could but only if I could do Yoda because she was very tiny
331000	333000	That's what I was going to say
333000	335000	I mean if you could do the midget size
335000	337000	Well I made Sassy Pants my Warcraft character
337000	339000	I made her based off of Young Sung
339000	341000	She's the chick with the giant afro and she's quite sassy
341000	343000	And very cool
343000	345000	And I also made a male guy based off of
345000	347000	He kind of looks like Robin from the old school
347000	350000	Because he has the little mask and very vibrant colors
350000	352000	But he's based off of Tyra
352000	354000	Who's the hula hoop girl
355000	357000	But I gave him a very very manly voice
357000	360000	So as he's like dancing around with the little hula hoop thing
360000	361000	He's like
361000	363000	You can kiss my ass
363000	365000	Things like that or whatever he's saying
365000	366000	It's really funny
366000	368000	I love customization modes, it's great
368000	371000	That's the only reason why I would play wrestling games
371000	373000	To make my own character
373000	375000	So it's great
375000	377000	I had a lot of fun with customization
377000	379000	And online mode plays like fun
379000	381000	I played DMN from understation live
381000	383000	On Saturday nights at all games radio
383000	385000	I was playing DMN one night
385000	387000	I played him as Sassy Pants
387000	389000	Because you can use your custom characters online
389000	391000	That's so great
391000	393000	What the hell is this
393000	395000	Of course he was Yoda
395000	397000	Because everybody online is playing Yoda
397000	399000	He's like what the hell
399000	401000	So it was fun
401000	403000	And for the record, I beat his ass
403000	405000	But no, we had a lot of fun playing Soul Calibur
405000	407000	Here's the things I don't like about Soul Calibur
407000	409000	I actually like the Star Wars characters
409000	411000	I don't know why people are so like
411000	413000	Uh, they throw things off balance
413000	415000	I've never been that hardcore into Soul Calibur
415000	417000	So I don't study the game mechanics or the science
417000	419000	I think it's fun
419000	421000	Deal, I especially think
421000	423000	Starkiller is a great, great character
423000	425000	I love playing as him
425000	427000	So he's awesome to get in the game
427000	429000	By the way, if you want to unlock him
429000	431000	You have to beat arcade mode with Yoda
431000	433000	Or I imagine Vader on the 360
433000	435000	So there you have it
435000	437000	I think he's a great addition
437000	439000	On the PS3
439000	441000	So I like playing as him
441000	443000	I like the new characters
443000	445000	What I don't like, I don't like the single player modes
445000	447000	Story mode is very, very short
447000	449000	It doesn't need to go on forever
449000	451000	But climbing the tower up and down mode
451000	453000	Which is basically just an excuse
453000	455000	To fight
455000	457000	Like five people all at once
457000	459000	In a row
459000	461000	And unlock things that you have no idea
461000	463000	What the conditions are to unlock them
463000	465000	Until you actually do it
465000	467000	Then it'll go, oh, you made it through a whole match without getting hit
467000	469000	That was the surprise, to unlock something
469000	471000	Ta-da, you get a new bra for using
471000	473000	Custom character mode
473000	475000	I mean, that's literally what it is
475000	477000	I am hearing, and I do see it a little bit
477000	479000	That some of the game mechanics
479000	481000	Of some of the old characters
481000	483000	Kind of got screwed up a little bit
483000	485000	Like for instance, Shaoran
485000	487000	Says Talim got slightly less hot
487000	489000	Between two and three
489000	491000	And she plays a little different too
491000	493000	And Ivy, I noticed especially, plays different
493000	495000	It's hard to explain
495000	497000	But some characters I still have a lot of fun with
497000	499000	I want to make a character
499000	501000	I love him, he's awesome
501000	503000	I want to make one that's more foul than Voldo
503000	505000	Here's the other interesting thing about the Soul Calibur
505000	507000	The online content
507000	509000	Some of it is available and you can download
509000	511000	For just 100 Microsoft points
511000	513000	You can get some extra customization
513000	515000	Which is basically like old
515000	517000	Costumes
517000	519000	And the cool thing is you can actually customize the existing characters
519000	521000	Like change the colors of their outfits and stuff
521000	523000	So that's kind of neat
523000	525000	It is pay to unlock content though
525000	527000	Because it's only like 100 kilobytes
527000	529000	But it's only 100 points, that's not the end of the world
529000	531000	But here's what I thought was a little weird
531000	533000	You can also download extra
533000	535000	Songs for use in stages
535000	537000	From the old Soul Calibur games
537000	539000	So pretty much there's 12 songs
539000	541000	From the old Soul Calibur games all available
541000	543000	At 100 points a pop
543000	545000	Practically, or maybe even it was like 120
545000	547000	But you can get the pack of all of them for like 1200
547000	549000	I apologize if I'm misappropriating those points
549000	551000	But I think it was 80 points per song
551000	553000	But you can get, maybe it was more like 16 or something
553000	555000	Because you can get it for like 1200 points
555000	557000	You can get them all
557000	559000	Which I think is a little silly
559000	561000	You know, why not
561000	563000	Xbox supports custom soundtracks
563000	565000	Why don't I like get the Soul Calibur soundtrack
565000	567000	Through methods online
567000	569000	Burn it to a CD, rip it to my Xbox
569000	571000	Ta-da! Custom soundtracks of the old music
571000	573000	So, a little bit weak
573000	575000	So, yeah
575000	577000	The cons would be single player mode
577000	579000	But the pros would be customization
579000	581000	I think the Star Wars characters are a good thing
581000	583000	Despite what people say
583000	585000	They're not, they're just like
585000	587000	Link being in Soul Calibur 2 on the GameCube and Spawn
587000	589000	There's something different
589000	591000	You don't have to play with them
591000	593000	But expect to see a lot of them online
593000	595000	And online mode is nice
595000	597000	Other games I've been playing this week
597000	599000	Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2
599000	601000	On the Xbox 360
601000	603000	Which I would say
603000	605000	Is the best game on Xbox Live Arcade right now
605000	607000	I think it's great
607000	609000	And it's a
609000	611000	Even though they upped the price from $5 to $10
611000	613000	I think it's a heck of a deal
613000	615000	Because you get the six different modes in the game
615000	617000	Pacifism mode
617000	619000	So much, like, that mode is fun
619000	621000	And it's weird because you don't even shoot
621000	623000	In that mode, you just fly around the screen
623000	625000	Dodging enemies
625000	627000	But it's so disgustingly simple
627000	629000	Like the old Atari 2600 games
629000	631000	And the old 80's games
631000	633000	That was just, you know, shoot things
633000	635000	Don't get hit, that's it, it's so simple
635000	637000	That's one of the reasons I think I love Geometry Wars
637000	639000	Is it really kind of
639000	641000	Kind of, I don't know, kind of
641000	643000	Recalls those days of the past
643000	645000	These very simple video games
645000	647000	And you practically have like six different games in a way
647000	649000	Kind of in there
649000	651000	And I really like the way they've incorporated the leaderboard into the game
651000	653000	They've basically made the game all about
653000	655000	Beating your friends
655000	657000	The achievements are interesting
657000	659000	They're a lot easier to get than they were in Geometry Wars 1
659000	661000	But like, you know, for instance
661000	663000	There's these two achievements, Wax On and Wax Off
663000	665000	And you do it in Pacifism mode
665000	667000	And the Wax On is
667000	669000	Circling around the screen
669000	671000	Touching every wall
671000	673000	But as you start to do it
673000	675000	Then the game realizes you're going through the achievement
675000	677000	And it starts lighting up the wall
677000	679000	On how much of it you've circled
679000	681000	And then Wax Off is doing the same thing twice
681000	683000	Which is kind of hard to do when Pacifism mode
683000	685000	Gets going
685000	687000	So I was pretty impressed by how they
687000	689000	Kind of worked in the achievements
689000	691000	I like that they made it very competitive with a friend's leaderboard
691000	693000	And I got to try multiplayer
693000	695000	Which sadly is not on
695000	697000	Xbox Live because we all know that's what they're going to do
697000	699000	For Retro Evolve 3, I'm sure
699000	701000	To make that fresh
701000	703000	But with Retro Evolve 2 you can play at least in the same house
703000	705000	Multiplayer, which is a surprising amount of fun
705000	707000	Again, if you like old classic arcade games
707000	709000	With excellent graphics
709000	711000	I think the graphics are so great
711000	713000	They're really a step up from
713000	715000	Geometry Wars 1
715000	717000	Where it really has that kind of
717000	719000	Neon glow to the graphics
719000	721000	It really looks like you're playing a freaking
721000	723000	Vetrex or something
723000	725000	I think it's great
725000	727000	I highly recommend Geometry Wars 2
727000	729000	If you even like shooters in the slightest
729000	731000	It's a great deal at $10
731000	733000	I know the price went up, but you get six different games now
733000	735000	It's worth it
735000	737000	Check it out, highly, highly recommend
737000	739000	Besides Final Fantasy 4
739000	741000	And Warcraft and the usual affair
741000	743000	That's pretty much it for my gaming week
743000	745000	But those two are the new, new games I've been playing
745000	747000	Looking at comments in the chat room
747000	749000	GS68 says
749000	751000	Geometry Wars Retro Evolve 2 sequence mode
751000	753000	Is reminding me of GigaWing
753000	755000	Son of Dad says GigaWing should be
755000	757000	On Xbox Live Arcade along with Mars Matrix
757000	759000	As if
759000	761000	There weren't enough shooters on Xbox Live Arcade
761000	763000	Mars Matrix was a cool game though
763000	765000	I don't know much about that, you're going to have to
765000	767000	I've got it somewhere
767000	769000	I'll have to hook up the Dreamcast
769000	771000	Alright, you'll have to do that
771000	773000	Anyhow, let's talk about a little bit
773000	775000	Of housekeeping tonight
775000	777000	First off in housekeeping
777000	779000	It is All Games Listener Appreciation
779000	781000	Month

821000	823000	Sadly
823000	825000	We will not be live in two weeks
825000	827000	Since this is housekeeping, there will be
827000	829000	No live show, Sunday
829000	831000	August 17th, this is the first time actually
831000	833000	The folks in the studio are hearing about this too
833000	835000	Surprise, Loki
835000	837000	I heard about it earlier
837000	839000	That's because I was
839000	841000	Looking to win, but Loki ran through the door
841000	843000	At the last minute and I neglected to tell him
843000	845000	Last minute, but like a half an hour
845000	847000	I forgot, I forgot
847000	849000	Here's the thing
849000	851000	I don't talk about my personal life too much
851000	853000	But this is too funny to pass up
853000	855000	I've been seeing William for a year and a half now
855000	857000	The thing about William and I is that we're both
857000	859000	Really big nerds
859000	861000	We actually spent our first anniversary
861000	863000	We actually drove down to Long Beach and went to the
863000	865000	Star Trek tour at the Queen Mary
865000	867000	That's how big nerds we are
867000	869000	Well here's the thing, we've always talked about
869000	871000	How we're going to go to the Star Trek experience
871000	873000	Because I haven't been since I was like 20
873000	875000	Like right before I started working at my
875000	877000	Current job, so it was about 7 years ago
877000	879000	So it was a long time ago when I was last at the
879000	881000	Star Trek experience, and we keep talking about how
881000	883000	We're going to go back, we're going to go back because I've never ridden the Borg
883000	885000	4D ride, well then I read
885000	887000	On the internet last night
887000	889000	They are shutting down the Star Trek experience
889000	891000	On September 1st, which is so
891000	893000	Sad, like, I don't know
893000	895000	Why they would shut that down, it's so cool
895000	897000	So it really lit a fire
897000	899000	Under our ass to go to the Star Trek
899000	901000	Experience before it closes, but because
901000	903000	Of Penny Arcade Expo, because of
903000	905000	Some other commitment I have in Reno
905000	907000	In 3 weeks, because of the fact
907000	909000	There's a huge convention in Vegas next week
909000	911000	It really only made sense
911000	913000	We have to go to Vegas in 2 weeks, so
913000	915000	We booked a trip, and we're going to Vegas in 2 weeks
915000	917000	Very last minute trip
917000	919000	Thank you to the various websites
919000	921000	Online, so yes I am a
921000	923000	Giant nerd going to the Star Trek experience
923000	925000	In Vegas in 2 weeks, so there will be a live show
925000	927000	We might pre-tape something, I don't know yet
927000	929000	Nerd. So
929000	931000	What? What was
931000	933000	By the way, for the record folks
933000	935000	The first thing that DarkSakura said
935000	937000	To me, I want to go
937000	939000	I do
939000	941000	I do not want to go
941000	943000	I haven't seen, I haven't
943000	945000	Been on the Borg ride
945000	947000	Bobby Blackwolf says they're shutting it down because Star Trek
947000	949000	Is irrelevant these days, bite your tongue
949000	951000	There's that new movie coming out
951000	953000	That's an awful thing to say, you take that back
953000	955000	You take that back Bobby Blackwolf
955000	957000	Alright
957000	959000	So I'll be in Vegas in 2, yeah
959000	961000	Blackwolf says, I actually tried to see if I could
961000	963000	Get to Vegas this month too
963000	965000	Because I've never seen the Star Trek experience, ha!
965000	967000	Anyhow
967000	969000	So 2 weeks
969000	971000	And we'll fill you in more on what's going to happen that week
971000	973000	I don't know if DarkSakura and Loki are going to do a show
973000	975000	Or if we'll pre-tape something or what we're going to do
975000	977000	So we'll see
977000	979000	I'll just burn things live on air
979000	981000	For the imagination show
981000	983000	Yeah, that'd be great
983000	985000	Or the fuck show, no you can't do the fuck show without me
985000	987000	We can't do the fuck show until we're all here
987000	989000	You can't do it without me
989000	991000	Alright, that's it for pretty much housekeeping
991000	993000	Otherwise, join our MySpace at Orange Launch Radio
993000	995000	Join our Facebook, OL Army, our live journal

999000	1001000	If you check out the Orange Lounge Radio forums
1001000	1003000	The OL archive has been built
1003000	1005000	It's this, I don't know
1005000	1007000	They use SkyDrive
1007000	1009000	Or some website where you can share
1009000	1011000	Masses of big files
1011000	1013000	Because I am a generous, nice, kind, giving person
1013000	1015000	I actually uploaded
1015000	1017000	20 old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio
1017000	1019000	Old, moldy
1019000	1021000	Stanky episodes
1021000	1023000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
1023000	1025000	Episode 20-40 I think are up there on the OL archive
1025000	1027000	Along with some other old school
1027000	1029000	Orange Lounge Radio stuff
1029000	1031000	I'm going to warn you in advance
1031000	1033000	It was a much different show 5 years ago
1033000	1035000	Be warned, if you're expecting the same stuff
1035000	1037000	Here now, it's even worse
1037000	1039000	If you can believe it
1039000	1041000	So there you have it, the OL archive
1041000	1043000	More information available on our forums
1043000	1045000	Alright, enough whoring ourselves out, let's get to some gaming news
1045000	1047000	Yes, this week, Nintendo
1047000	1049000	Along with 54 other developers
1049000	1051000	Filed a lawsuit against
1051000	1053000	I don't know
1053000	1055000	A lawsuit against the makers
1055000	1057000	Of the R4 device
1057000	1059000	As well as, I'm assuming they're going to try to
1059000	1061000	Expand it
1061000	1063000	Against all the devices out there
1063000	1065000	Basically trying to make laws passed now
1065000	1067000	To prevent people
1067000	1069000	From pirating their games
1069000	1071000	That's funny
1071000	1073000	Yeah
1073000	1075000	Don't you think that'll just make it worse, or what?
1075000	1077000	Well
1077000	1079000	Yes, I actually
1079000	1081000	Because of the news, I went ahead and bought another one
1081000	1083000	Just to stick it to it
1083000	1085000	No, just
1085000	1087000	Cause my wife wanted one
1087000	1089000	She plays puzzle games
1089000	1091000	And I don't see
1091000	1093000	I don't know
1093000	1095000	Well, let me read this real fast before we talk a little more about this
1095000	1097000	Cause this is right in the same line with us
1097000	1099000	Talking about how, you know, you guys are running off and buying one
1099000	1101000	And all this
1101000	1103000	Actually, the word is that the R4
1103000	1105000	Pricing and the sales of them are
1105000	1107000	Increasing a lot
1107000	1109000	After this whole lawsuit happened
1109000	1111000	Apparently, in two days time
1111000	1113000	The price of an R4 at
1113000	1115000	Some stores in Japan went from
1115000	1117000	Just under 3,000 yen
1117000	1119000	To just under 5,000 yen
1119000	1121000	From $28 to $55
1121000	1123000	Literally overnight
1123000	1125000	The question is, is maybe that what Nintendo was trying to go for
1125000	1127000	Driving the price of these up
1127000	1129000	Due to the fear
1129000	1131000	I don't know, that seems a little counterproductive to me
1131000	1133000	Cause it makes the demand of them go up in a way
1133000	1135000	I don't think that's really gonna affect anything
1135000	1137000	Because people are just buying them really fast
1137000	1139000	And now they're just figuring, hey, we can cash in on it now
1139000	1141000	But
1141000	1143000	I mean, when the demand goes back down, they're just gonna clear out their
1143000	1145000	Inventory somewhere, and they'll still be sold
1145000	1147000	You know, somewhere
1147000	1149000	But, hey, I mean
1149000	1151000	At least they're taking notice of this, I guess
1151000	1153000	In a way, though, let's get
1153000	1155000	Devil's advocate Loki, these devices
1155000	1157000	Can promote piracy
1157000	1159000	So why should they be allowed on the market?
1159000	1161000	Well, because
1161000	1163000	Guns can kill people, so
1163000	1165000	You know
1165000	1167000	It's not the gun killing the people
1167000	1169000	It's the people killing the people
1169000	1171000	With the guns
1171000	1173000	It's just like, these devices, sure, they can
1173000	1175000	Allow you to pirate games
1175000	1177000	But it's the people pirating the games that are actually
1177000	1205000	Pirating the games
1205000	1207000	Well, I mean, honestly
1207000	1209000	I don't think that they necessarily should be
1209000	1211000	Allowed
1211000	1213000	I mean
1213000	1215000	But people are gonna do it anyway
1215000	1217000	You know, it's, I look at it as sort of, you know
1217000	1219000	The whole, like, the whole
1219000	1221000	Drug trade
1221000	1223000	I was just saying, as you were saying,
1223000	1225000	You know, I think
1225000	1227000	You know, I think
1227000	1229000	You know, I think
1229000	1231000	You know, I think
1231000	1233000	You know, I think
1233000	1235000	I was just saying, as you were saying
1235000	1237000	That I'm almost thinking in my mind
1237000	1239000	Like, marijuana, you know
1239000	1241000	A lot of people smoke pot
1241000	1243000	I personally choose to not smoke pot
1243000	1245000	That's a personal preference
1245000	1247000	But it's kind of one of those things that even though it's against the law
1247000	1249000	A lot of people do it anyway
1249000	1251000	Well, that's what my thought would be
1251000	1253000	That Nintendo talk to the developers
1253000	1255000	And make multi-packs
1255000	1257000	Of old games
1257000	1259000	So that, um
1259000	1261000	You know, say you buy x number of
1261000	1267000	They can market something like that, or even have their own download service for old games like that.
1267000	1268000	Like virtual consoles?
1268000	1270000	Well, I'm talking about for the DS.
1270000	1276000	Perhaps they're looking at the virtual console and perhaps expanding it to the DS
1276000	1280000	and going to put a device similar to that to do such a thing anyways,
1280000	1284000	and they're worried people are going to pirate the virtual console games, which are five to ten bucks a pop.
1284000	1289000	You know, it's not twenty dollars a pop, but still, that's a lot more games that you can fit on those cartridges
1289000	1295000	because those things are a few kilobytes versus 32 megs, 42 megs, and stuff like that.
1295000	1300000	But that may be something that they're worried about.
1300000	1306000	Or the fact that they're worried that sales are going to dip a lot, like the PSP, because they blame piracy on that.
1306000	1308000	I blame bad games, but you know.
1308000	1314000	But piracy, being able to play old Nintendo games on the PSP kind of drove sales in the beginning.
1314000	1317000	Jamie, I wanted to let you finish your thought before I go to chat comments.
1317000	1318000	Yes, thank you.
1318000	1325000	My whole point is that I honestly do think that Nintendo might be looking to market something like that,
1325000	1330000	and it doesn't really matter because piracy is illegal, that's the end of the story.
1330000	1338000	If you use something that is non-proprietary that is not sponsored by Nintendo to play copies of their games,
1338000	1340000	it is technically theft.
1340000	1347000	So, I don't think they're ever going to be okay, but I think Nintendo might be looking for a way to sort of market the idea for their own benefit.
1347000	1350000	So I can see why they would want to push it.
1350000	1358000	Although honestly, Nintendo has had the easiest way to pirate or play imports or anything on their systems.
1358000	1365000	Because in the past it was just a physical lockout, you adjust a tab and boom, you can play your imports on your Super Nintendo.
1365000	1370000	You know, there were absolutely no lockouts on the old Game Boys.
1370000	1375000	You can still play imports on the DS and you can buy those multi-game cartridges for dirt cheap.
1375000	1385000	So really, the whole problem I think is that Nintendo needs to look at how they're actually allowing it, is how I see it.
1385000	1393000	They've had to have built in some way because they have not been the best at preventing the piracy from going on.
1393000	1398000	Let's look at some comments from chat at chat.orangelaunchradio.com because it's your show too here at Orange Launch Radio.
1398000	1400000	We'd like to hear what you guys have to say.
1400000	1405000	Blake says, it's the law of software, stopping piracy is impossible no matter how hard you try.
1405000	1411000	ActDef says, disclaimer, use it for homebrew only as in programs and stuff, don't pirate please.
1411000	1413000	To which I think this is kind of a good follow up comment.
1413000	1419000	Joshi16 says, it would be like banning smoking pipes because you can put illegal drugs in it but you can also put tobacco in them.
1419000	1422000	So it's kind of like how you choose to use it.
1422000	1424000	Interesting approach.
1424000	1428000	Dark Tetsuya says, I agree with Loki though, I probably wouldn't risk my DS by using one of those.
1428000	1430000	If it breaks, I'm screwed.
1430000	1432000	MissingNo says, I heart the R4.
1432000	1437000	That's the thing though, it won't hurt your DS at all because it's a device that runs on a cart.
1437000	1440000	You're not flashing your DS, you're not doing anything to your DS.
1440000	1446000	AlphaCananagram says, this is bullshit but if they do take down these devices, they need to leave the homebrew only flash carts alone.
1446000	1451000	TigerClaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a homebrew up to listen to internet radio on your DS.
1451000	1455000	GameGuru says, well if Nintendo makes their own R4, that would be cool.
1455000	1458000	And I love this name too, the original Snake.
1458000	1465000	Lieutenant Pliskin says, absolutely okay, sure it makes it possible but there are lots of homebrew and other features.
1465000	1468000	People will always find a way to pirate.
1468000	1471000	I thought this comment was interesting though.
1471000	1474000	Hitstun says, I guess I still don't understand how piracy is theft.
1474000	1480000	I'm not sure if you're being facetious but do keep in mind, you know, people get paid to make games.
1480000	1484000	Just like people get paid to make movies and paid to write music and what have you.
1484000	1488000	And when you take it without paying for it, that's less money.
1488000	1495000	Now granted you get into this whole step, step, step thing about, you know, especially in the record industry.
1495000	1499000	Well, how much of the money is really going to the artist and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1499000	1503000	But, you know, regardless, you are taking money out of the system by copying.
1503000	1506000	Yes, this Dark Knight says, copy kills music.
1506000	1510000	Remember what Captain Jack always used to say, copy kills music.
1510000	1515000	Alright, so if you have further comments on this story, mail back at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
1515000	1523000	Well, in other news, there is an interesting thing in regards to the whole piracy idea.
1523000	1537000	It was actually stated by David Reeves for Sony Europe that you could download the PS3 films on BitTorrent while you're waiting for the European PSN network.
1537000	1549000	So, yeah, he's actually saying that we, and this is a quote, we are a PAL market and we are going to do it in PAL and we are going to do it properly.
1549000	1558000	So, he said that if you want the good quality, then you can, you know, I guess just wait for it or download it like everyone else does.
1558000	1565000	It's not often you hear people acknowledging. He's an idiot.
1565000	1572000	I have something I want to say about Sony, which is completely off base, so before I go on tangent, does anyone want to comment on the actual story?
1572000	1579000	Okay, I saw Casino Royale for the first time last night, which by the way, I forgot how sexy Bond movies are.
1579000	1582000	Isn't James Bond just a sexy fucking franchise of movies?
1582000	1584000	I don't know, I haven't watched the last movie.
1584000	1589000	But just in general, all the way back to the Sean Connery days, Dark Sakura?
1589000	1590000	If you say so.
1590000	1591000	Really? I think they're hot.
1591000	1594000	I like certain movies, I'll put it that way.
1594000	1599000	This is how it's relevant. They hoard Sony in that movie.
1599000	1607000	James Bond uses a VAIO, the cell phones were from Sony, like the movie studio to put that out, I'm sure, was Sony Pictures.
1607000	1611000	I just lolled at the fact how much Sony was hoarded in that movie. It was just kind of fun.
1611000	1614000	Like, I noticed. Usually, I don't notice those things, but...
1614000	1618000	And like if we made a movie, we would be putting orange on stuff all over it?
1618000	1620000	Well, that's different.
1620000	1624000	We're trying to buy dinner. These people have a lot of money.
1624000	1627000	Well, they're trying to buy a lot of dinner at the same time.
1627000	1628000	Alright, forget it. Move on.
1628000	1637000	Anyways, so, in case you had some hope out there that Final Fantasy XIII Versus was possibly coming to the Xbox 360,
1637000	1646000	Square says, no it's not. In fact, according to their video that they played during their latest kind of fan event,
1646000	1652000	I don't even know how you would pronounce this, DKS3713 party.
1652000	1659000	Anyways, they had the video for Final Fantasy Versus which said, PlayStation 3 only worldwide.
1659000	1664000	And in small print, fuck you, Xbox 360 fanboys. No, just kidding.
1664000	1670000	It was not coming out on the 360. Although, I'd be interested to see if that's actually going to be the case
1670000	1677000	when the 360 version of Final Fantasy XIII comes out and kicks ass sales-wise.
1677000	1683000	But, we'll see. At least it's exclusive for the meantime.
1683000	1687000	It gives the fanboys something to hold onto, right?
1687000	1689000	Sure.
1689000	1695000	I'm interested in Final Fantasy XIII Versus. If it stays a PlayStation 3 exclusive, I will probably have to pick up the PlayStation 3.
1695000	1702000	Isn't anyone at all disturbed at the fact that they're releasing like four different Final Fantasy XIII games at the same time?
1702000	1705000	No, because they've released like seven different Final Fantasy VII games.
1705000	1711000	Yeah, over the course of like five years or something, but now it's just like, hey, those all sold really well.
1711000	1714000	Let's make a lot of games all, you know, portioned apart.
1714000	1716000	And you won't be buying them?
1716000	1726000	I will be buying every single... No, two of the three. One of which happens to be on, well, one of them that I will not be buying is on the PSP.
1726000	1730000	But, you know, that's a whole other story we already touched on.
1730000	1734000	Let's talk about this, though, as far as Final Fantasy XIII is concerned.
1734000	1737000	The question is when. When is this game going to come out?
1737000	1741000	The game will be coming out in Japan in 2009. That is confirmed.
1741000	1746000	It was announced at Squeenix's little get-together thing they had in Japan this past week.
1746000	1753000	Now, keep in mind that means only the PlayStation 3 version and only in Japan, because they're not going cross-platform over in Japan.
1753000	1759000	However, it will be out in 2009, and then they're going to start the localization and the port for the Xbox 360,
1759000	1767000	which probably means we'll see it in 2010, because when they say they're going to get it in 2009, that probably means Christmas of 2009.
1767000	1771000	But we'll see. We could be pleasantly surprised. Who knows?
1771000	1775000	All I know, I can't wait to see what the game actually looks like.
1778000	1779000	We'll see.
1779000	1788000	Well, in other news related to Squeenix, they actually have a bunch of games that are going to be coming out for the DS in Japan,
1788000	1791000	and they're calling this new line Pure Dreams.
1791000	1799000	There are two games that are going to be the first two out. One is Snoopy DS, Let's Go Meet Snoopy and His Friends,
1799000	1802000	and then Pingu Waku Waku Carnival.
1802000	1808000	I don't really know much about these games, except one of them is Snoopy, and the other one has a funny name,
1808000	1812000	but there's no release date for them in anywhere but Japan, and it just says Autumn.
1812000	1816000	Really, it should be called Fozzie Waka Waka Carnival.
1816000	1817000	That's Waku.
1817000	1818000	I know.
1818000	1819000	Okay.
1819000	1821000	He was making a bad joke.
1821000	1822000	That was a really bad joke.
1822000	1824000	I'm going to throw a tomato at Loki.
1824000	1829000	At least it's a lot better than, I don't know, a Snoopy game.
1829000	1832000	Peanuts are still very popular overseas.
1832000	1836000	Peanuts are still very popular in my house. I love peanuts.
1836000	1841000	You know what will never stop being awesome? Ever? Snoopy snow cone machines.
1841000	1843000	Those are the greatest thing ever.
1843000	1845000	See? I rest my case.
1845000	1849000	Loki, remember? Remember when we lived together and I bought one?
1849000	1853000	And it took me like an hour to make a goddamn little slushie?
1853000	1855000	To be honest, I don't remember that at all.
1855000	1857000	I think that was a bastard.
1857000	1859000	No, seriously, I think you did that at your other apartment.
1859000	1862000	No, I'm almost positive it was when I lived with you.
1862000	1864000	We were buying all sorts of random shit.
1864000	1868000	I remember when you got the deep fryer for your birthday.
1868000	1870000	That was a Christmas gift, okay?
1870000	1871000	Okay, Christmas.
1871000	1877000	And yes, I remember it because it was awesome. The only problem was it wasn't as awesome as it needed to be for deep frying.
1877000	1882000	And that apartment did not have any sort of ventilation, which also sucked for deep frying.
1882000	1886000	I really like video games. I just thought I'd let you guys know that.
1886000	1889000	Really? Well good, I like deep frying and we're going to talk about that some more.
1889000	1891000	Let's deep fry some video games.
1891000	1893000	Yeah. Whatever.
1893000	1895000	Let's see.
1895000	1897000	Not deep frying.
1897000	1901000	Dark Tetsuya says, good grief, Rob.
1901000	1906000	Alright, well something that's not Snoopy related, but a lot cooler.
1906000	1915000	Japanese Advent Children fans are going to be happy that a brand new Director's Cut will be coming to Blu-Ray soon.
1915000	1920000	And with it will be coming the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
1920000	1924000	And with that will also be coming a new PS3 bundle.
1924000	1932000	All this is supposed to happen March 2009, and I don't know. I'm excited.
1932000	1934000	May have to import it.
1934000	1943000	So is it just me, or is it one of those things where I should have known the whole time this is why Final Fantasy VII Advent Children was kind of short?
1943000	1946000	This was just coming the whole time.
1946000	1949000	Bonus! 20 minutes deleted footage or whatever.
1949000	1952000	Sucker. I should just tattoo it on my forehead.
1952000	1953000	I should everyone else who bought it.
1953000	1958000	I would also like to remind listeners of the show not to text me while I'm doing the show. Thank you.
1958000	1960000	I get that too.
1960000	1962000	Especially when I don't know who you are.
1962000	1965000	I don't get that because I turn my phone off.
1965000	1967000	Well good for you.
1967000	1973000	Alright, the PSP game which Loki earlier referred to is that kind of missing Final Fantasy XIII game.
1973000	1976000	You've heard a lot about Final Fantasy XIII and Versus XIII.
1976000	1983000	Well there's also Agito XIII is coming out as well. Agito. Agito. Agito.
1983000	1984000	It's a cell phone game.
1984000	1986000	That's the one that was supposed to be the cell phone game.
1986000	1990000	However, it's apparently also heading to the PSP.
1990000	1992000	It's part of the big franchise.
1992000	1997000	I think this is great. It's going to allow the PSP to, especially in the US where our cell phones aren't going to be able to run it.
1997000	2001000	I'm sure it's going to allow this to reach a much broader audience here.
2001000	2004000	I'm sure the success of Crisis Core had something to do with that as well.
2004000	2008000	So, more multi-platformism in the Square Enix world.
2008000	2011000	And this game soon to be on the PSP. Well not soon.
2011000	2015000	But eventually, one day, far in the future, to be on the PSP.
2015000	2022000	Well speaking of which, I don't know if anyone remembers that the latest Parasite Eve game was supposed to be exclusive on mobile phones.
2022000	2026000	Well, Squeenix actually said that it will be out on PSP.
2026000	2030000	And it doesn't say anything about there being a mobile phone version in development.
2030000	2033000	But it's called The Third Birthday.
2033000	2042000	And they had some sort of trailer of it up that has the main character Aya in a wedding dress.
2042000	2046000	So, I don't know. Oh, with a gun.
2046000	2048000	Well, because you have to have a gun.
2048000	2049000	You have to have a gun.
2049000	2053000	I was going to say, this is a franchise people have been waiting for for a long, long time.
2053000	2055000	I think it's been bigger since the last one.
2055000	2056000	It's been a long time.
2056000	2058000	Will she be in her birthday suit?
2058000	2060000	I wish they'd translate the novel.
2060000	2065000	Yeah, that's right. There was like a novel. Wasn't there something else that was like a cell phone game or something?
2065000	2067000	There was also a live action movie.
2067000	2069000	There was a movie. I've got the movie somewhere, but I haven't watched it yet.
2069000	2072000	But my friends read the novel a couple of times and it says it's pretty good.
2072000	2074000	I saw the movie. It was pretty cool.
2074000	2076000	I don't remember much of it though.
2076000	2079000	I remember your mitochondria are full of evil.
2079000	2082000	Son of Dad in chat says, Parasite Eve 2 is kind of a let down.
2082000	2084000	Well, I didn't play it.
2084000	2088000	Um, let's move on.
2088000	2090000	Alright.
2090000	2095000	Well, we're still waiting for home. Still.
2095000	2098000	But the Japanese home beta has finally opened up.
2098000	2102000	And they've added some interesting things to it as well.
2102000	2106000	Including some Namco arcade classic games.
2106000	2110000	Including Pacman, Dig Dug, that sort of stuff.
2110000	2117000	That will be playable in the arcades that are strewn about the home interface.
2117000	2124000	So they'll have the first few games that they mention Pacman, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Xevious.
2124000	2128000	And there will be three secret titles that are still on the way.
2128000	2131000	Mappy for the win.
2131000	2136000	You know what? One good thing about this though, and I assume you don't have to pay to play these games,
2136000	2138000	is that you don't have to pay to play these games.
2138000	2140000	That's a hell of an assumption, by the way.
2140000	2142000	Yeah.
2142000	2146000	Wouldn't it be interesting if you, because a lot of people thought this should be Xbox Live's prize model,
2146000	2150000	wouldn't it be interesting if you have to insert a quarter, quote unquote, to play the games?
2150000	2152000	I will not be playing those games, then. That's the case.
2152000	2156000	Because I have them on 360.
2156000	2159000	Dark Soccer, I'm kind of curious what you think about the Namco games being in home,
2159000	2162000	because, you know, I know you're an avid collector of the museum games,
2162000	2165000	so it kind of feels like we've had to buy them before, and now they're going to be free, maybe?
2165000	2168000	If they're free, I'll get them. If not, I don't care.
2168000	2172000	I mean, if they're not, I'm just not going to get them. I've got 50 million other copies.
2172000	2178000	I have an actual cartridge of Mappy somewhere in my house, so it doesn't really matter.
2178000	2185000	I've actually got, I think, almost the entire Namco PS1 collection.
2185000	2187000	That was the letters, right? M-A-M, yeah.
2187000	2190000	Although I'm still trying to find the trademark for the Japanese releases.
2190000	2191000	Ooh.
2191000	2193000	Yeah, I still had a hard time with that.
2193000	2195000	Pooface in chat, I love that name, says,
2195000	2198000	I hope that's not how the Xbox Prime Time games will work.
2198000	2203000	Interesting thought. We haven't heard anything about how that 1 versus 100 or any of that stuff's going to work.
2203000	2204000	So, who knows?
2204000	2207000	ActDef says, free is good, except for Yaris.
2207000	2210000	I want to say those Prime Time games are probably going to be free,
2210000	2214000	and they're going to probably finance them with advertisements.
2214000	2219000	You know, that makes sense, I think.
2219000	2221000	Yeah, advertisements will make sense.
2221000	2224000	It just, oh man, it's going to be just like the old Acrophobia days.
2224000	2225000	I can't wait.
2225000	2227000	That's how the Berkeley Systems games were funded, too.
2227000	2232000	Anyhow, not all the news in Squeenix Land is good this week.
2232000	2236000	We have a crap ton of Final Fantasy news, but this is also Final Fantasy related.
2236000	2239000	It has to do with Final Fantasy XI.
2239000	2241000	Oh, remember my old crack?
2241000	2244000	Remember Final Fantasy XI, the old crack game?
2244000	2245000	I try not to.
2245000	2249000	Well, how hard was it for you to cancel Final Fantasy XI when you finally did it?
2249000	2251000	Not that hard.
2251000	2252000	I didn't find it to be that hard, either.
2252000	2253000	Do you remember, Loki?
2253000	2254000	It was fucking easy.
2254000	2255000	Yeah?
2255000	2256000	It was just like stupid easy.
2256000	2257000	Well, here's the thing.
2257000	2262000	Apparently, someone does not agree, and the name is Alex Edwards, and he is actually kind
2262000	2267000	of, it's not so much a lawsuit, but what has happened is one thing has led to another.
2267000	2273000	There is now a new Illinois law that mandates that MMO providers have to make an online
2273000	2277000	cancellation option available, that you have to be able to do it online.
2277000	2278000	It is online.
2278000	2280000	That's what I was thinking, but here's the deal.
2280000	2281000	Here's how the story goes.
2281000	2283000	This guy was playing Final Fantasy XI.
2283000	2285000	He grew tired of the game.
2285000	2290000	His parents were paying $13 a month, and they tried to cancel the account online, but the
2290000	2295000	claim is that Final Fantasy didn't offer them a way to do it online, didn't offer a contact
2295000	2300000	phone number, so finally, they went to the credit card statement to get the phone number,
2300000	2302000	spent an hour and 45 minutes on hold.
2302000	2305000	Finally, someone answered the phone, and they got it canceled.
2305000	2306000	That's just because they're stupid.
2306000	2308000	You have to do it through Play Online.
2308000	2309000	They're retarded.
2309000	2311000	They're absolutely retarded.
2311000	2313000	You don't do it through the website.
2313000	2314000	You do it through Play Online.
2314000	2319000	I bet what happened is he uninstalled all the crap, and then was like, and you know
2319000	2324000	how awful Play Online is to uninstall, and then it was like, oh crap, I can't delete
2324000	2325000	it from the website.
2325000	2326000	I was supposed to do that on Play Online.
2326000	2330000	Well, duh, that's what the instructions say, and you have a manual.
2330000	2331000	Hi.
2331000	2335000	Well, maybe in that regard, does it have some merit then that you actually have to still
2335000	2337000	have the game installed to be able to cancel it?
2337000	2340000	I mean, to be honest, you don't for Warcraft.
2340000	2341000	You can do that all on the website.
2341000	2342000	It's super easy.
2342000	2345000	I mean, if you can't figure out how to cancel, wow, you're dumb.
2345000	2349000	I mean, it's really, really easy to cancel, wow.
2349000	2354000	He just pissed off that there's no big, giant button that encompasses the entire screen
2354000	2356000	that says, to cancel, click here.
2356000	2357000	The easy button.
2357000	2360000	I mean, seriously, it was not that hard to figure out how to cancel.
2360000	2361000	It wasn't hidden in menus.
2361000	2363000	It was so easy.
2363000	2368000	It was right on the Play Online screen if you wanted to cancel it.
2368000	2373000	And obviously they had to have signed up for an account, and it's done the exact same way
2373000	2376000	as you cancel it, so they're retarded.
2376000	2377000	I'm sorry.
2377000	2382000	And the fact that this went all the way to become a law, wow.
2382000	2385000	It's a case of people overcomplicating a simple issue.
2385000	2390000	Hey, folks in Illinois, I hope that you're happy that your tax money's being used this way.
2390000	2394000	Just because I wanted to read the summary of the actual law.
2394000	2398000	An Internet gaming service provider that provides service to a consumer for a stated term
2398000	2402000	that is automatically renewed for another term, unless a consumer cancels the service,
2402000	2406000	must give a consumer who is an Illinois resident a secure method
2406000	2408000	at the Internet gaming service provider's Web site
2408000	2410000	that the consumer may use to cancel the service,
2410000	2413000	which method shall not require the consumer to make a telephone call
2413000	2416000	or send US Postal Service mail to effectuate the cancellation,
2416000	2420000	and two, instructions that the consumer may follow to cancel the service
2420000	2422000	at the Internet gaming service provider's Web site.
2422000	2425520	site. Makes it an unlawful business practice for an internet gaming service provider to
2425520	2429300	violate the new provisions. Now is it just me though, or was it a heck of a lot easier
2429300	2436300	to cancel Final Fantasy XI than it was to cancel America Online? Maybe I'm crazy, but
2436540	2441780	at least they weren't begging me to stay. Actually, if you call them and do it, they'd
2441780	2446620	try to get you to stay by giving you free months. On Final Fantasy XI even? No, on...
2446620	2451500	Oh, oh yeah. Oh yeah, America Online tries to pull it all out, so... I was like, um,
2451500	2458500	my account was already free. Retention. Anyhow, so, there you have it, new laws. Ridiculous.
2458700	2465700	Oh my god, this is stupid. But anyway, how about some release dates? Like, three items
2465800	2471800	coming out on the 8th in Europe. We have Beijing 2008, the official video game of the Olympic
2471800	2478800	Games on PC, Race Driver Grid on DS, and The Mummy Tomb of the Emperor on Playstation 2.
2478800	2485800	That's it. Sorry. I can't say that the US is much better. This week we have the King
2487280	2494280	of Clubs, which is some crappy golf game on the Wii. There's Summer Athletics, I believe
2495700	2502300	the 360 version coming out this week, for some reason it was delayed from last week.
2502300	2507920	Rock Blast, which is a DS puzzle game. Monster Madness, Grave Danger, which apparently is
2507920	2514360	a slightly upgraded version of the Monster Madness game that was on the 360. So, I don't
2514360	2521360	know what you get when you upgrade crap, but I'm probably guessing it's not that great.
2524080	2530360	And yeah, B-Boy is also coming out this week on PS2 and PSP. And to be honest, I think
2530360	2536200	that's about it. I mean, slow week. Wow, is it just me, or is it kind of a slow release
2536200	2543200	week in general over there? Well, it's slow because of Madden coming out next week. Ah,
2543360	2547080	yeah. That's the game I don't get too excited about. Oh, there's a Cheetah Girls game coming
2547080	2554080	out, my mistake. How could I have missed that? Damn, fired. I know, seriously. Why am I not
2554900	2558800	keeping up with the Cheetah Girls games? Well, in Japan we have a lot of stuff coming out.
2558800	2562380	They also have a sports game coming out this week. It's NBA 2K8 is coming out in Japan
2562380	2566900	on August the 7th, as well as Tales of Vesperia comes out. There also is a super premium pack
2566900	2570440	for Tales of Vesperia coming out this week. I believe that is the one that comes with
2570440	2574600	the Xbox 360, if I'm not mistaken. I think there was a bundle pack coming out in Japan.
2574600	2579120	Don't quote me on that. Also, a PlayStation 3 version of NBA 2K8 is being released this
2579120	2586120	week. Moving on to the Nintendo Wii. Survival Kids Wii. I wonder if that's lost in blue.
2586400	2591800	It is lost in blue. Yeah, I think it is. Yes, it's lost in blue on the Wii. So that's coming
2591800	2598800	out. Imabikiosu Kamihan comes out as well on the Wii this week from Sega. And this game
2600000	2607000	looks to be, what the heck, it looks like it might be kind of a horror type game on
2607200	2610720	the Wii. Looks like the graphics are pretty cool. Got some neat little cut scenes there.
2610720	2614800	I don't know, that's either a horror game or a dating sim. But seeing as it looks like
2614800	2618920	it's a horror game. Yeah, it looks like a horror game, but seriously, in this one screen
2618920	2624760	you have ABC choices. That looks like a dating sim to me. It's a super emo horror game. That'd
2624760	2631760	be awesome. A horror dating sim. I think the brains at the O.L. Army headquarters need
2633040	2638920	to get to work on a horror dating sim. Not a whore, but a horror. On the PlayStation
2638920	2642480	2, God of War 2 gets a price reduction this week in Japan, moving into the best price
2642480	2649480	series. Also, Grim Grimoire and Sengoku Barasa 2 Heroes also move into that same series.
2650440	2656760	Some new games coming out this week. True Tears is coming out as well as Aokoro no Kusabi.
2656760	2662760	Hiro no Kakeru 3 comes out in Japan this week, which is, looks like some type of role
2662760	2669080	playing-ish game. You play a dude with a sword. I don't know, it kind of looks like a dating
2669080	2676080	sim. Why would he have a sword if it's a dating sim? Because all cool kids have swords who
2677160	2683680	date, because if it goes bad, you know, they can commit suicide. Just stop. Just stop.
2683680	2688440	Hey, I just wanted to mention real quick that in a couple weeks, actually, we're going to
2688440	2694880	be getting Lion Rider 2, which is exciting for the DS and the Wii. On the Nintendo DS,
2694880	2701880	Monster Farm 2 DS in Japan this week, as well as Fire Emblem. Shinankoku Ryotun Hikari no
2703280	2710280	Ken comes out this week, as well as Choshiotu Kadukistu, which is a game from Atlus, comes
2711160	2717960	out on the Nintendo DS this week, which, oh, it's Trauma Center 2. Nice. You finally get
2717960	2724960	that in Japan this week. Coming out on the Sony PSP, just some price reductions on Quiz
2725040	2732040	Mobile Suit Gundam Tonsenshi, as well as Daisenryaku Portable 2 and Doku Maki Murikai. They all
2733920	2739460	get price reductions this week, but as far as new games go, Crazy Taxi Double Punch comes
2739460	2744080	out on the PSP this week in Japan. That's happy. Get ready to make some crazy money.
2744080	2748920	That's it for your Japanese release dates. Back to some gaming news. Well, in other gaming
2748920	2755700	news, and this actually isn't necessarily just Just Just Game, but this is for our cosplay
2755700	2762160	people as well. Gamefly is having an open casting for the next commercial, so they actually
2762160	2768680	want cosplayers to send them videos saying why they love Gamefly, and why the character
2768680	2775680	that they're dressed up at is their favorite. But, you know, I think it's going to be kind
2776680	2781760	of iffy, but here's the details if anyone wants it. There are live casting calls that
2781760	2788600	are going to be in LA, New York, and Chicago. That's in September, and you actually send
2788600	2795600	a 45 second entry after August 26th. As far as more information on this, the live casting
2795600	2801600	calls are September 9th, Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Highland Center, and that's 12 to 6 p.m.
2801600	2808600	PST. September 16th in Chicago, ESPN Zone on East Ohio Street from 12 to 6 central time,
2810600	2817600	and September 23rd, New York at Hawaiian Tropic Zone on 7th Avenue and 49th Street at 12 to
2818600	2823600	6 p.m. EST. All those cosplayers are going to fit right in at Hollywood and Highland.
2823600	2830600	I actually told Rama the minute I read about this, I went to Twitter and I posted, Rama,
2831600	2835600	Black Luigi needs to be in this commercial. Make it happen. So he said he's going to go,
2835600	2840600	so I hope if he... Cover it for us. Yeah, cover it for us. I want to know if it is any
2840600	2846600	good or if it seems like a scam or whatever, but I think it'll be good. I want lots of
2846600	2850600	photos from this event. You know people are going to go just for the photo ops because
2850600	2855600	that's like half the big thing about cosplay is your photo ops too. Any excuse to be on
2855600	2859600	TV, people are going to go nuts. You know people are going to see these commercials
2859600	2865600	and go, what? Yeah, I know. But there will be other people that get it. Hey, cosplay
2865600	2871600	opportunity, go for it. Exactly. Hey, cosplayers can get like actual real recognition in the
2871600	2876600	real world. I think it's a good thing. So there you go. Loki is going to be giving us
2876600	2880600	a massive homebrew update tonight. What is this? There's like massive amounts of news
2880600	2886600	in the homebrew world. Just a bunch of little small things. Okay, so first off we're going
2886600	2891600	to start with the Wii. If you've never done homebrew or are having trouble figuring it
2891600	2897600	out, they actually have a website now that'll make it a lot easier for you and it's presented
2897600	2902600	by Wii Brew and it's the Wii Pack generator and what it does is it allows you to kind
2902600	2908600	of toggle different things you want to be installed in one giant zip file and you download
2908600	2914600	it and you drag and drop it to your SD memory card and if you have Twilight Princess you
2914600	2918600	can use the Twilight Hack to install the homebrew channel and a bunch of different homebrew
2918600	2923600	programs on there and they've got a huge list of stuff and they keep adding more to it so
2923600	2928600	definitely the way to go if you haven't done homebrew stuff yet or if you just want to
2928600	2933600	take it easy to find all your programs in one spot. Rob I think will get some use out
2933600	2939600	of this but they have the Any Title Deleter. It's a space-freeing program for the Wii.
2939600	2946600	It allows you to remove previously unremovable tiles including the weather and news channel.
2946600	2950600	Unfortunately though if you have any games that have updates they will reinstall them
2950600	2957600	for you. But I like the weather channel because I like the music. What about the news channel?
2957600	2962600	Okay news channel is kind of a waste. Okay so you can remove stuff if you want to and
2962600	2965600	some other things like that and they have protection so you don't break your console
2965600	2970600	and that kind of thing. One thing though that is a little bit more risky but you can do
2970600	2975600	it as well with this is the Wii Region Changer. You can actually use this device to change
2975600	2980600	the region of your Wii so that it's a Japanese console. Of course everything will be in Japanese.
2980600	2984600	There is some risk involved with it though. You have to read the instructions very carefully
2984600	2988600	because you can actually break your console with this if it's not done right.
2988600	2994600	So don't do it. Yeah. Just don't. Just don't. There's region free players on the Wii so
2994600	3002600	just use those instead. Guitar Fun which is the Fretz of Fire game that they have now
3002600	3009600	for the Wii and that of course for those who may not know is a Guitar Hero sim or emulator
3009600	3014600	I guess. And you can import custom songs and all sorts of things. Well the new version
3014600	3020600	2.9 has come out. It's still in beta but it now has online support and so they have
3020600	3026600	instructions on how you can set up your PC or router I guess to be able to play online
3026600	3030600	with other people. So that's kind of neat though. You can do online. I don't know if
3030600	3035600	you can actually do online on the Wii with Guitar Hero 3. I think you might be able to
3035600	3042600	but either way it's so cool. Now for the PS3. It's actually interesting. There's some
3042600	3046600	sort of a homebrew scene actually starting up on the PS3 now that people figured out
3046600	3052600	that you can use the Blu-ray Java dev kit to actually create programs that can run on
3052600	3060600	the PS3 and no modding is needed whatsoever because it's running off the BDJ Java that's
3060600	3065600	built into any Blu-ray disc. So it's already built into the system and so people are actually
3065600	3069600	creating like Pong programs and all the simple stuff that comes out in the very beginning
3069600	3074600	but it's only going to lead to more and the best part you know they aren't really going
3074600	3079600	to be disabling it anytime soon since it's built into all the Blu-ray discs so basically
3079600	3086600	you just load the programs onto a jump drive and away you go. So that's pretty cool. And
3086600	3094600	let's see. And that's it. Alright. Lots to do in the homebrew world. Yes. But I don't
3094600	3098600	have time for homebrew unless there's something really really good that I'm really missing
3098600	3102600	but lately I haven't been that excited about it. Well there's actually one thing that they've
3102600	3106600	been kind of trailering on a bunch of websites this week. Remember that game I was playing
3106600	3112600	before called No Gravity? It was a homebrew PSP game that was kind of a space shooter.
3112600	3117600	Like a 3D space shooter. It's actually now becoming a full game on the Playstation Network
3117600	3122600	that's going to be downloadable via them. You actually have to pay for it now. But you'll
3122600	3126600	be able to download it to your PSP and play it but it's the first time that a homebrew
3126600	3132600	game like this has become downloadable on the Playstation platform so that's kind of
3132600	3138600	neat. And hopefully they'll be coming soon. Okay. Well I wanted to read this comment from
3138600	3144600	chat. Going back to the cosplay gamefly commercial thing. SSJ100Matt I believe was the one that
3144600	3152600	said this. Manfay. Could Manfay make an appearance? Manfay would either be scary or fantastic.
3152600	3159600	That's kind of both extremes don't you think? I want the male Utena cosplayer to show up
3159600	3164600	who looked perfectly female. I wish I lived in New York with Rama because I'd go and dress
3164600	3171600	as Black Mage. So maybe we could both be in it. I'm not sure what Black Mage has in common
3171600	3178600	with Luigi but you never know. I am very excited about this upcoming game and Dark Sakura.
3178600	3184600	I don't know about you but maybe you'll play this with me. Sing Star Musicals is a new
3184600	3190600	rumored game to be coming out. Supposedly it's going to be coming out in 2009 and some
3190600	3195600	songs that are rumored to be in it. Bad Guys from Bugsy Malone. Can You Feel the Love Tonight
3195600	3200600	from The Lion King. If I Were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof and Over the Rainbow from
3200600	3207600	Wizard of Oz. However I need this song to be in it. If at all possible.
3207600	3224600	Oh not Springtime for Hitler. No you should find the one from the movie. Is that the one
3224600	3231600	from the movie? No. It's just because John Barrowman sang the one in the movie. I don't
3231600	3236600	think they have the one from the movie on iTunes. The recent movie because well I think
3236600	3241600	he's wonderful. So yeah this is a rumored game that's going to be coming out. That being
3241600	3245600	said I actually think this rumor is bull. I think this rumor is a load of crap. I don't
3245600	3250600	believe that it's true. One of the big reasons I don't think it's true is that this rumored
3250600	3255600	song list has Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King. Disney owns that and if
3255600	3260600	Disney was going to put that in a game Disney would be making a Disney game. Disney I don't
3260600	3264600	think would be likely to loan this out. One of their biggest songs. I mean granted I don't
3264600	3267600	know I guess Elton John wrote it so maybe there's a way around it. And it's not really
3267600	3272600	a musical either. Actually yes they did a Lion King musical. I know they did but it's
3272600	3276600	Disney's musical. It's not Sony's you know what I mean and I don't think Sony would be
3276600	3280600	able to license that from Disney. Does that make sense? I don't know if it's necessarily
3280600	3286600	Disney that owns Soul Rites. Plus I mean would there really be that many people that are
3286600	3293600	going to buy this? I mean maybe. I would. I would too but we're kind of weird. So? Okay
3293600	3298600	then again I guess Poofy said they made Sing Star Bollywood so I guess anything's possible.
3298600	3304600	Well yeah. Well then again I mean that would. That makes sense though for a European release.
3304600	3308600	It does. It does. And maybe this isn't something that's going to be coming out here. Maybe
3308600	3311600	this will be coming out in other areas where Sing Star is bigger. Well if it's a Sing Star
3311600	3318600	game I would suspect that it would be a European release. Well I still want to import it. This
3318600	3324600	will be fun. Well you know there's also been a big surge in West End theater now. Especially
3324600	3329600	with those shows that they're doing now. Sort of like an American. Well not like. Sort of
3329600	3335600	like a pop idol though for musicals. How do you solve a problem like Maria? And the other
3335600	3339600	one. Hey that was a John Barrowman show. Yes it was. I'm thinking you're a fangirl. I'm
3339600	3345600	a little bit of a fangirl. But it just seemed to me that theater's having such a bigger
3345600	3350600	resurgence overseas that it could be possible that that's why there'd be a Sing Star game.
3350600	3354600	So I could sort of see it happening. I do have one other request for Sing Star musicals.
3354600	3360600	You are ruining my song. Oh me sorry. Me no mean to. Well if you wouldn't mind please
3360600	3367600	being quiet for a minute so I can finish. Okie dokie. Good. I'm glad we have this new
3367600	3377600	technology. For porn. Which gives us untold opportunity. For porn. Oh sorry. God it'll
3377600	3385600	never get old. Avenue Q is playing in town Rob. We need to go seriously. I know. For
3385600	3391600	porn. We've said that as the previous cage match winner if I do recall correctly. I'm
3391600	3397600	sure. I think it was a cage match winner at one point. Love it. And a very good question
3397600	3402600	from chat. Very very good informed question. SSJ100Matt says Rob what about Sing Star
3402600	3409600	Rocky Horror Edition? Yes please. That would be hot. How do you do I? See you've met my
3409600	3417600	faithful handyman. But it has to have an audience participation subtract. Yes. But people
3417600	3421600	and you know this. Do you know how much money I would pay for Loki to sing Sweet Transvestite
3421600	3426600	Live on Air? I would put money in that pot seriously. I totally would. You should just
3426600	3433600	sing it for us right now anyway. In a single costume. We're waiting. No. Chirp chirp chirp.
3433600	3437600	Alright Sing Star musicals hopefully coming to a Playstation near you. I have something
3437600	3443600	that's even more in the special category if we can get on to our next segment. We absolutely
3443600	3447600	can. It's a segment we love to do every week. It's very special. It's the classic video
3447600	3450600	game of the week. Dark Soccer will dig through the archive and tell you kids what you should
3450600	3457600	be playing. What should the children be paying a little respect to this week? The game of
3457600	3466600	the week is Jumping Flash. Nice. I love Jumping Flash. But I've mentioned this show on air
3466600	3474600	many many many times. When I first moved into my college dorm room I was put in charge of
3474600	3481600	my friend's boyfriend's Playstation. And he had Jumping Flash and I played the hell out
3481600	3487600	of it and it was an awesome game. So the story behind this and I love this. That a demented
3487600	3495600	astrophysicist named Baron Aloha removed pieces from earth with land lifting machines
3495600	3505600	and so this cute little electric bunny named Robin has to use these jet pods to you know
3505600	3511600	I guess break these jet pods and get the little islands back to earth. What? Can I just say
3511600	3516600	to son of dad in chat this is not Jumping Jack Flash with Whoopi Goldberg. No. This
3516600	3521600	is different. Stop it. Anyway the way that the game plays is it is very first person
3521600	3530600	and I will tell you that this totally totally made me motion sick as hell but it's great.
3530600	3535600	Actually the article makes a note that it's actually just like a game called Geograph
3535600	3541600	Seal which is for the Sharp X68000 so I'll have to look for that later on. But anyway
3541600	3546600	you play as Robin looking through Robin's eyes and you've got a screen showing you how
3546600	3552600	much time you have remaining and your score and the sidekick called Kumagoro which gives
3552600	3559600	you hints and warnings and helps you out. You've also got fireworks items as your sort
3559600	3564600	of like your firing mechanism, power ups, jet pods, all this other neat stuff that goes
3564600	3569600	with it. But so the big thing about it though is you have to jump and you can make him jump
3569600	3575600	three times. You can jump off the ground twice in mid air and you can get really high over
3575600	3584600	the ground. And instead of though being faced horizontally when you jump the camera tilts
3584600	3590600	down towards the ground. So it's, you see why I'm talking about getting motion sick
3590600	3597600	there too? But you can also use your enemies to bounce off of in some cases. But you get
3597600	3602600	different fireworks for attacks like cherry bombs, rockets, roaming candles, and twisters.
3602600	3609600	You can get time extensions, you can get different jet pods that are EXIT and so when you get
3609600	3615600	them you go to the exit pad and you can leave the level. You also have hidden levels, you
3615600	3621600	have a roller, the roller coaster level was fun I have to say. And you have a time attack
3621600	3628600	mode so you can try to get out of the levels in a certain amount of time. There also was
3628600	3635600	a sequel that was called Jumping Flash 2 that did not do as well. But it was still a fun
3635600	3642600	game. And apparently there were pseudo sequels that were only released in Japan. There was
3642600	3650600	Robert Mundo on Playstation and Pocket Moomoo that was on Pocket Station and they were released
3650600	3662600	by Sugar and Rockets whereas these were actually released by Exact. Was Baron Aloha in Project
3662600	3666600	Moomoo or Pocket Moomoo? I actually do not know, I have not played Pocket Moomoo. It
3666600	3670600	sounds like someone needed a vacation in Hawaii. But I came really close to actually importing
3670600	3677600	Robert Mundo once. I guess now I could find it a lot cheaper I'm sure. But it's actually,
3677600	3684600	you can get Jumping Flash at the Playstation store. And coming soon the next sequel, Captain
3684600	3692600	Uma Uma Nuka Nuka Appa Waha. Never mind. Bad joke. Oh come on Ferret. I never actually
3692600	3698600	played Jumping Flash. You didn't! No I never did. I have Jumping Flash in the massive old
3698600	3704600	Playstation cases. Keep in mind, Playstation 1 era was around the time I was in college.
3704600	3709600	So the only Playstation 1 games I really got into, yeah but I kind of left gaming for a
3709600	3713600	little while. I really only was playing like Final Fantasy 7 and Puzzle Fighter. I didn't
3713600	3721600	play a whole lot during that era. Puzzle Fighter came out years after. At any rate, if you
3721600	3725600	want to play this game then I will see about locating my copy of it and bringing it over
3725600	3732600	or something. But it's really, it's cheese ball and it's you know, it's early Playstation
3732600	3738600	but it's a fun little game. Alright. That's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge
3738600	3742600	Radio with that Jumping Flash, your classic game of the week. We're going to take a quick
3742600	3747600	break but we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after some music for the
3747600	3752600	live listeners. And actually if things get sent to me in time here we'll do some music,
3752600	3755600	oh yes we're going to have some music on the podcast as well tonight as well. I'll tell
3755600	3759600	you a little bit more about that in just a minute. But we'll be back with more of Orange
3759600	3767600	Lounge Radio.
3767600	3772600	Hey all our listeners, this is GS68 with a public service announcement. When playing
3772600	3777600	Super Smash Brothers, do not have fun. Do not play with items on. Items ruin the balance
3777600	3782600	of the game and add randomness. Do not pick low tier characters. You will not win them
3782600	3787600	with them no matter what. The best balance repair will always lose to the worst fox player.
3787600	3792600	The only stage allowed is Final Destination. If a stage has more than a flat plane on it,
3792600	3797600	it's bad. It ruins the balance of the game by giving characters advantages. Take your
3797600	3802600	episode of gimmicks and shove it. Huge stages like Hammer Castle for camping morons. Even
3802600	3806600	Smashville is barely acceptable but there's a freaking moving platform on top of the main
3806600	3811600	platform. And finally, remember, I don't care if you're at a party and just want to have
3811600	3815600	fun with your friends. Video games are not about fun. They're about winning. So shut
3815600	3820600	the fuck up and stop having fun because video games are serious business. Thank you and
3820600	3824600	good night. This PSA was brought to you by Mushroom Kingdom, one of the never-ending
3824600	3826600	scrolling bullshit.
3826600	3830600	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Be sure to navigate through the forums and find the
3830600	3859600	O.L. Archive, where you can find such clips as this.
3859600	3869600	Oh yes, the good old days of Orange Lounge Radio.
3869600	3872600	That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter closet, wasn't it?
3872600	3876600	I think so. I think it was one of those weekends back when Karaoke Revolution was funny.
3876600	3881600	Anyhow, thanks to our listeners who provided the bumpers that break. GS68 was the first
3881600	3887600	one and PKJR92 did the second one. So thank you guys so much for those bumpers. If you
3887600	3891600	have a bumper you want to send, go look at the forums. There's a whole post about us
3891600	3897600	accepting things for our free break and that would be fake PSAs, promos for non-profit
3897600	3902600	shows and things like that and so on. So hope to get some stuff from you.
3902600	3906600	Meanwhile, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August
3906600	3913600	the 3rd of 2008, for more Orange Lounge Radio gaming news, gaming chat, gaming bitching
3913600	3917600	and whatever we can come up with. Loki, how about some Xbox news?
3917600	3925600	Yeah, so there's another rumor coming out. Yeah, another one. I know. This one actually
3925600	3933600	has come from Ars Technica and apparently they have their Microsoft insider who lets
3933600	3939600	them know all the wonderful rumors and information and stuff like that. They were ones, I believe
3939600	3945600	he was the one that was kind of clueing people in on that 68 model that was going to be introduced.
3945600	3954600	Well now, apparently sometime in September, there is going to be another price drop and
3954600	3958600	it's going to be dropping. This is actually the price drop because if you remember the
3958600	3963600	last one was kind of the phase out 20 gig models but I guess by that time they'll be
3963600	3971600	all gone. What's going to happen is the Elite is going to drop down to $399 from $449 so
3971600	3978600	that's a pretty nice drop there, another $50. The 68 system will drop down to what the
3978600	3988600	Pro system is now for $299 and the Arcade system will drop from $279 to $199. So that's
3988600	3994600	pretty cool. And apparently around that time also the hard drive, the 120 hard drive is
3994600	3999600	supposed to drop in price and I think probably the 60 as well will be coming out at some
3999600	4005600	point. And the other interesting thing about that that kind of coincide with all that is
4005600	4015600	there was some screenshots on VG charts apparently from the inside of their, some system, I don't
4015600	4021600	know what store this is from but it's saying that the price drop is going to happen confirmed
4021600	4028600	on the Arcade system on September 7th, 2008. So that seems to give us a little more legitimacy
4028600	4032600	than when this rumor usually flies around because I was just about to ask, what makes
4032600	4036600	this any different from any other price cut rumor? Yeah, and well what's interesting though
4036600	4041600	September 7th, that's another Sunday and they like to drop them on Sundays so they can have
4041600	4045600	the ads and everything. And if you think about it, it makes sense too because everyone's
4045600	4051600	saying, oh it's because the exclusives are coming out for the Xbox 360, you know Infinite
4051600	4058600	Undiscovery and Rock Band 2, well a time exclusive for Rock Band 2, but I say it's because the
4058600	4063600	Playstation 3 exclusives are going to be coming out around that time too. Actually they're
4063600	4070600	going to start coming out with a lot of their big Playstation exclusives around October
4070600	4074600	7th and if they kind of get a jump on everything, especially now that they're talking about
4074600	4083600	putting out a core 80GB system out there for $399, you know it's kind of funny though,
4083600	4090600	it just kind of nullifies all that. Well I say they're doing it to be ready for Christmas
4090600	4094600	and also to get down there to where the Wii's at because now they're going to be the same
4094600	4102600	price. Almost. Right? The Wii's, is Wii 199 or is Wii 250? Wii's 250. Oh, see they're
4102600	4107600	going to be cheaper than the Wii at this point, that's huge. Yeah. That's really huge I think.
4107600	4112600	Do you think Nintendo's going to have to follow suit? No. I guess not, Wii's are still in
4112600	4116600	demand. Because they're very, I would say they're very arrogant, so unless the Wii system
4116600	4121600	takes some hits as far as sales goes, then they may. I don't think they are because they're
4121600	4125600	still high in demand and they're selling over retail anyways, so people have no problem
4125600	4131600	paying the $400 for a Wii system right now. I don't know why you would, but they are.
4131600	4136600	Alright, well we'll see. I'm sure it will drive sales come Christmas time if they do
4136600	4141600	end up doing that. And I'm sure this is only a rumor because none of these rumors ever
4141600	4145600	come true. I think there seems to be a lot of truth in this. I think we all know Xbox
4145600	4150600	is going to cut the price and to really get below Nintendo I think is going to be huge
4150600	4155600	for them. So we'll see. Anyhow though, I want to talk about this one reason that might sell
4155600	4161600	a lot of Xbox is zombies. I love zombies. We don't have enough zombies on Xbox. I mean
4161600	4166600	yeah, we have Dead Rising, but we don't have zombies on Xbox Live Arcade that I can think
4166600	4171600	of. And when I talk about zombies, I'm talking about the actual tabletop game Zombies. I
4171600	4174600	don't know if you've ever seen this game. It's an actual tabletop game that kind of
4174600	4179600	uses cards. And you know, tabletop games have been kind of popular on Xbox Live lately.
4179600	4183600	I mean you have Carcassonne, Catan, Ticket to Ride. You know, why not? Let's get zombies
4183600	4188600	in there as well. And this actually had to do with a gamer who was actually like sending
4188600	4195600	ideas on how to turn a zombie game into an Xbox Live Arcade game. Well apparently, according
4195600	4201600	to a joystick report, that's joystick with a Q, they actually ran into Todd Breitenstein.
4201600	4206600	He's from Twilight Creations who actually made the tabletop game. Ran into him at Comic
4206600	4210600	Con, which happened recently. And in response to are they going to make a zombies game for
4210600	4216600	Xbox Live, got the ever famous I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a project.
4216600	4223600	But don't you think it would be cool? And the answer is yes. Zombies are always cool.
4223600	4227600	Zombies are fantastic. So there you have it. Chat room, what do you think? Yes or no to
4227600	4231600	zombies on Xbox Live? I'm all for more of the board game type fare on Xbox Live Arcade
4231600	4237600	too. I think those games are fun. Well, and other fun. And this makes me particularly
4237600	4245600	happy because you know I love Valve. Right? Well, you know that there's going to be a
4245600	4252600	Portal Still Alive coming out on Xbox Live, but it looks like Valve is really considering
4252600	4258600	bringing other titles from their services. So I think that's pretty cool. And that they
4258600	4265600	actually don't yet have any immediate plans to try the Wii or PS3. So hey, they love you
4265600	4273600	Microsoft Xbox owners. You have the love of Valve. Indeed. Very much. But you do not have
4273600	4279600	GLaDOS in this one. And that is not as great. So do you think it's kind of a money milking
4279600	4282600	thing? Kind of a cheap... Well, all business is money milking when you think about it.
4282600	4288600	Yes, that's true. Only if you're a non-profit organization do you not look to make a profit,
4288600	4294600	right? True. Commenting to a question Lieutenant Pliskin asked in chat says, can you put a
4294600	4298600	hard drive in the no hard drive model of the 360? Let's say you want to download Portal
4298600	4302600	Still Alive and these other possible future Valve releases. Yes, you can. You can put
4302600	4306600	a hard drive in the core model. It's very easy. Actually, when I first got an Xbox 360,
4306600	4310600	I actually bought mine when they were really hard to come by and Best Buy was only getting
4310600	4315600	like five of them at a time. And when I got there, they didn't have elites. I was only
4315600	4319600	able to get a core so I actually paid the slight extra money to get the core and the
4319600	4322600	hard drive with it. Which at the time was worth it because you couldn't get an Xbox
4322600	4327600	360 really. It was so hard. And then to put icing on the cake, I got the Red Ring of Death
4327600	4331600	three days later. Remember that? Good times. Because I came on here and I bitched, whined
4331600	4337600	and moaned on the show so bad. I was so pissed. But all is better now in Rob's world. Especially
4337600	4346600	after the yumminess of Soul Calibur IV and Geometry Wars 2 this week. You know, I'm going
4346600	4350600	to have to get that Geometry Wars, I think. At least get the demo. The demo from what
4350600	4354600	I hear is almost the full deadline mode which is get as many points as you can in three
4354600	4358600	minutes and it's a really good way to test if you're going to like the game or not. So,
4358600	4366600	at least get the demo. So, let's move on. Okay, shit. Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you
4366600	4372600	over there. Well, you guys were still talking about freaking Geometry Wars. I was waiting.
4372600	4379600	Anyways, so, you may remember that the Bourne Supremacy just came out beginning of June
4379600	4386600	and stuff and that was part of the whole VinVidi license and stuff, actually Sierra Entertainment.
4386600	4392600	Well, now that they've been purchased by Activision and Blizzard have merged together, they're
4392600	4397600	starting to, or Activision and VinVidi and Blizzard and all those companies have merged
4397600	4402600	together, they're starting to kind of go through what franchises they own and kind of slim
4402600	4411600	it down a bit. And one of those franchises, of course, is the Bourne Supremacy and, or
4411600	4416600	Bourne Conspiracy, I'm sorry. And actually the whole Bourne lineup. In fact, there's
4416600	4420600	some other stuff about that as well. But they're actually giving back the Bourne Conspiracy
4420600	4427600	to Lundrum Entertainment, you know, because Robert Lundrum, of course, was the guy that
4427600	4432600	wrote the Bourne books. So, it's kind of going back to them and I guess, I don't know if
4432600	4438600	they want to put any other games out, they have to find a new publisher, I guess. Interesting.
4438600	4444600	Well, you know, it didn't just stop there with the Bourne series. Activision and Blizzard,
4444600	4448600	they're kind of looking at some of the other franchises as well. And some of the franchises
4448600	4452600	that were rumored this week, Brutal Legend, Ghostbusters, the video game, were supposed
4452600	4457600	to be lost. It actually came out a little later in the week, that is not true. Ghostbusters
4457600	4463600	absolutely not canceled, according to Vivendi Sierra, not canceled. That is still happening.
4463600	4467600	The spokesperson for Sierra had actually said, quote, first and foremost, the game is not
4467600	4472600	canceled. However, the game may not have a publisher right now. That was a little more
4472600	4480600	in the blue there. Also, Brutal Legend is fine. So, that series is still supposed to
4480600	4485600	be on the way. Well, it's really weird, though, that they would keep Spyro, Crash, and all
4485600	4489600	that stuff and get rid of, I don't know, the good games. Spyro's kind of a money machine.
4489600	4494600	Yeah, and they kept 50 Cent, Blood in the Sand, or whatever that thing is. That game
4494600	4499600	sounds very interesting. Chronicles of Riddick, apparently, was booted to the curb, too. Yeah,
4499600	4503600	I mean, that, I think, was a long ways away, anyways. Well, I just hope they didn't get
4503600	4509600	rid of the Island of Dr. Brain, am I right? What? Because the Island of Dr. Brain was
4509600	4516600	an awesome Sierra game. If you say so. Remember, it was probably like a year ago, we had those
4516600	4521600	kids that were making the Silver Lining, remember that, the unofficial King's Quest sequel,
4521600	4524600	the Silver Lining? And then they went through that whole song and dance where they had to
4524600	4528600	lose the King's Quest ties, and now the game is just being released as the Silver Lining.
4528600	4533600	I wonder if all this recent, you know, Mergy-merge news means maybe they can get away with doing
4533600	4539600	it as a King's Quest game again. I doubt it, but it's still nice to imagine. I suppose,
4539600	4545600	if you want to keep dreaming. Yeah, I know. But hey, if we didn't have Dreamers, we also
4545600	4550600	wouldn't have Bums, so, kidding. Lieutenant Pliskin makes a very excellent point in chat,
4550600	4557600	chat.orangelsonsray.com. 50 Cent greater than Chronicles of Riddick? Both great. Question
4557600	4561600	mark, question mark. You know what we need, speaking of like movie franchises from like
4561600	4565600	10 years ago. What? When I went to see The Dark Knight the other day, they were showing
4565600	4571600	on the screen a preview for Starship Troopers 3. Why did we never get a video game for that?
4571600	4576600	I think there were video games. There was a PC game. Yes. We need more. And there's a
4576600	4580600	comic right now. I know there's like comics and other types of things, but no good game
4580600	4587600	where you can just go blow up bugs in the good old American way. Forget it. I tried.
4587600	4594600	Anyway, well you know, I'm not sure if everyone's familiar, but there were screen captures and
4594600	4600600	video out for Soul Calibur IV that was showing Darth Vader and Yoda in the same game, which
4600600	4608600	as we knew, Yoda was in the Xbox 360 edition and Darth Vader was in the PS3 one. And the
4608600	4616600	director of the game, Katsutoshi Sasaki, said that they don't have any plans for making
4616600	4622600	either one downloadable content for either console. But then again, apparently those
4622600	4628600	screen captures and the video that was out are supposed to be legitimate. You know, actual
4628600	4636600	same versions of the game. So, maybe that was just like a... I would assume that in
4636600	4640600	programming both characters would have been included, right? So it might just be from
4640600	4646600	the developer's kit or something. You know, it could be either from the developer's kit
4646600	4650600	or there's a rumor floating around and you really would have to read in between the lines.
4650600	4654600	This guy is saying it's not going to be download content, right? But some of the rumors that
4654600	4659600	are going around say that you will actually, if you buy The Force Unleashed, the game that
4659600	4663600	The Apprentice or Starkiller is actually starring in, it unlocks the other Star Wars character
4663600	4668600	on your respective system. That's smart. It's an interesting way of doing it. It's a way
4668600	4672600	of saying, hey, buy this game and please don't think that it sucks. And so, you know, no,
4672600	4680600	it's not download content... It's the biggest version of Pay to Unlock ever. Seriously.
4680600	4685600	Well, the question is then, if that's the case, then I wonder if it's a save file or
4685600	4689600	something like that. Who knows? But the other thing to consider, there's a trailer for The
4689600	4694600	Force Unleashed in the game. And I'm sure that's part of how they were able to negotiate
4694600	4698600	Starkiller and Yoda being in the game. But just very interesting. It kind of makes you
4698600	4703600	think, ah, maybe there's... I see what you did there. I would bet 10 to 1 that's going
4703600	4707600	to be the way you unlock it is that you have to get Force Unleashed, which means it'll
4707600	4713600	be impossible to find on Gamefly. And I wonder if having the fact that you have Soul Calibur
4713600	4719600	IV if that unlocks something for you on The Force Unleashed. Perhaps. Maybe an alternate
4719600	4725600	costume for Starkiller since he does have two in Soul Calibur. Who knows? Might be a
4725600	4729600	little silly, but you never know. The unlocks aren't always that great. They should just
4729600	4734600	chain them and they'll have something else and then you'll unlock... Just time release,
4734600	4738600	Vader. You know, like three months from now, just time release them. Do a patch that unlocks
4738600	4742600	them. It's obvious something's going to go there. There's one square in the game that
4742600	4747600	is not filled in. And if you look on the PlayStation... That goes for nobody. It's very obvious.
4747600	4752600	That's like, you know, one for me and one for my homies. They looped like six characters
4752600	4758600	in one screen. The star screen. Not to be confused with Starkiller. They had famous
4758600	4763600	anime creators make Soul Calibur characters, but they're just all filed under the star
4763600	4767600	icon in the select menu. And some of them are pretty cool, actually. But anyhow, sorry.
4767600	4775600	Getting off topic. That's interesting, though. Good theory. Something completely unrelated
4775600	4783600	to Star Wars. The shit game, as I mentioned during my gaming week. It's a game that looks
4783600	4789600	like shit. Literally. It basically looks like the whole game was made out of MS Paint, and
4789600	4794600	it very well may have. But the whole reason, I guess, is it's supposed to be like all the
4794600	4798600	shovelware games that you play out there. Just the absolute worst of the worst. But
4798600	4803600	it is a pretty fun game, and it's just really strange looking. It's all black and white.
4803600	4808600	Really strange stuff in there, from a level with crashing planes to a giant foot like
4808600	4818600	Monty Python. Floating eyeballs. Awesome. Fire. All sorts of crazy stuff. And basically
4818600	4823600	the game, I mean, it's very short, but it challenges you to try to beat it, losing the
4823600	4828600	least amount of lives and getting through it quickly. And there are a lot of quick ways
4828600	4833600	you can kind of glitch through the game and beat it a lot faster. So it is worth a download
4833600	4840600	if you're looking to check it out. Go to Doomlaser.com, and there's an article there called
4840600	4845600	a game by any other name would still be shit. I would actually like to see a game where
4845600	4856600	a giant foot comes down and squashes your character and then suddenly... Yes. I knew
4856600	4863600	this was coming. Oh, and the best part about the game, I forgot to mention, is that all
4863600	4871600	the music in it is MIDI. And it's all like, you know, like pop music MIDI. Like they have
4871600	4877600	Spice Girls in there, and it's all randomly selected too. Like Lenny Kravitz and Spice
4877600	4882600	Girls and stuff. I think that from here on out, all the rest of Loki's stories should
4882600	4893600	be done to Monty Python's Flying Circus opening. Okay, we can arrange that. Okay. We'll see
4893600	4897600	how that works, we'll try. Now here's the thing though, wouldn't this be Shit Game 2?
4897600	4903600	Because I've played Ping Pals. Well, Shit Game 3, because I've also played Yaris. Oh,
4903600	4908600	I see. But see, that's the thing, is this game's actually better. But seriously though,
4908600	4913600	the character looks like he's made from MS Paint, and I think he was. He looked all...
4913600	4918600	It was hilarious, I watched the video of it. I did download the game before the show. Haven't
4918600	4924600	played it yet, but I'm gonna give it a try. Is it maybe a minimalist thing? Like irony
4924600	4929600	through minimalism? It's special. It is a very special game. You know, when we start
4929600	4933600	putting naughty words into the names of video games, it makes us want to use other naughty
4933600	4937600	words here on the program. We have one very naughty segment we do every week here on Orange
4937600	4959600	Radio. You know what it's called? The FUs of the Week. My FU of the Week, it first of
4959600	4967600	all goes towards my cat and her passengers. I have had to bathe the cat today. She has
4967600	4975600	bad fleas, and they did not all wash off, so I have to get ahold of Heather, you know,
4975600	4978600	I have to get ahold of Heather and get some front lines for my kitty cat. Well, I know
4978600	4982600	Heather, but the listeners don't know Heather. Heather's awesome! Okay, that's all you need
4982600	4989600	to know. That's all you need to know. But I have to get her treated and so she stops
4989600	4994600	going bald out from her allergies and I don't know because I've been treating her for the
4994600	5000600	last three months and nothing has helped her, so I'm just, I hate them. I hate the little
5000600	5007600	squirmy things on my baby cat. Death to fleas. All of them! Except for Red Hot Chili Peppers.
5007600	5015600	Because that flea is awesome. Okay. That flea may survive the flea holocaust. Yes. Alright.
5015600	5019600	Lowkey, your FUs of the Week. A few people driving around, still talking on their cell
5019600	5025600	phones without their Bluetooth headsets. Amen! I followed some chick today because... The
5025600	5030600	speakerphone's okay, right? The speakerphone's fine. If you have a hands-free phone, I am
5030600	5035600	fine with that because that's following the law and you shouldn't be as much of a nuisance
5035600	5039600	on the road. But there's still these fucking people and they're idiots, they're talking
5039600	5044600	around, you know, with their cell phones and just driving fucking slow and just really
5044600	5049600	annoying. In fact, this woman actually, she drove through the parking lot really slow
5049600	5053600	and then, oh, my other favorite thing is when there's a slight dip in the road or something
5053600	5059600	like that and people slow the fuck down. Well, they're in an SUV, an off-roading vehicle
5059600	5064600	and they slow the fuck down because it's a little dip in the road. Oh my god. That's
5064600	5068600	also annoying. Just a point, though. Somebody talking on the cell phone in their parking
5068600	5073600	lot wouldn't technically be illegal. They're still driving. I know, but it's technically
5073600	5077600	they can't pull you over in the parking lot. Well, she's still driving around, so that
5077600	5082600	still counts. Just a technicality. I'm just saying. And I followed her there, but she's
5082600	5085600	a dumb bitch and I actually thought about knocking on her window and going, get off
5085600	5091600	the fucking phone, ass. But no, I had better things to do. Alright, is that it? That's
5091600	5096600	it. Alright. F you to clothes shopping. I went clothes shopping yesterday. Actually,
5096600	5100600	shopping for clothes is fun. It's grown a meal. I used to hate it when I was younger,
5100600	5104600	but now I love shopping for clothes. The only thing I don't like is paying for them. And
5104600	5108600	I'm not advocating theft of clothes, but I went to Mervyn's this week because I heard
5108600	5112600	they were filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy and I want to make sure I get all the good sales
5112600	5117600	before the chain goes under. And also, thanks to me being sick earlier this year and the
5117600	5122600	diet that has resulted, I've lost another waist size. So I had to buy all new jeans,
5122600	5130600	and that's expensive. Clothes are expensive. So F you to expensive clothes. But a non-F
5130600	5135600	you to Mervyn's and a non-F you to Mervyn's sales, because those are both awesome. I still
5135600	5139600	need to go to the outlets though this week, because the outlets are the best thing ever.
5139600	5144600	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news. I will bring it back with Mega Man 9 news.
5144600	5148600	It seems like every week there's something new about Mega Man 9. People loving the retro,
5148600	5152600	you know, coming back to this. Here's the neat thing is that Capcom has said this week
5152600	5156600	that the WiiWare version of Mega Man 9, it will have different control options. You can
5156600	5161600	turn the Wii mode on its side to play the game. You can also use the classic controller.
5161600	5166600	Anything that will go into the GameCube port you can also use to play. So if you think
5166600	5171600	about it, you could go all the way back to the Wii NES Retro port. You know, this is
5171600	5177600	a device that was released that allows you to, yes, plug in your old school NES controller
5177600	5182600	and play Mega Man 9 the way it might have been meant to be played with the old school
5182600	5187600	NES controller. What do you guys think? Is this worth going through the hassle just to
5187600	5191600	play with the old school NES controller? Or, forget it, just use the Wii mode. I think
5191600	5196600	that sounds like fun. It does not. It sounds like a challenge. And who doesn't love a
5196600	5200600	challenge? It sounds like another excuse for G4 to bring out their giant NES controller
5200600	5207600	to do something stupid on TV. Yippee! Can't wait. Out of curiosity, would this sway you
5207600	5211600	to buy this on the Wii, or are you still like, eh, not good enough, I'm still going to get
5211600	5216600	it on 360? That's right. That's kind of where I'm at. I'm like, oh that's cute. Well actually,
5216600	5225600	actually. Cute, but. I may still get it on the Wii. But. I'm still on my silly boycott.
5225600	5228600	I have no room. And that's where I stand. I have no room for games. Don't worry, don't
5228600	5234600	worry Rob. We won't have to purchase it. I will get it on the 360 I'm sure. But I like,
5234600	5237600	I like the prospect of being able to use the old controller. Why don't they put it on the
5237600	5242600	DS? They need to put like another Mega Man collection on the DS and release this along
5242600	5247600	with it. Do you think Capcom might release a remake of the game later on? I mean, they've
5247600	5251600	never done that before. Never ever, right? Do you think there might be a Mega Man 9 Championship
5251600	5259600	Turbo Edition next year? I doubt it. You never know. You never know. Well, moving forward.
5259600	5266600	And forward is a good way to move. Konami wants to hop on the, the old school bandwagon.
5266600	5271600	Because, well everyone else is doing it, why can't they? Well, then again, they were already
5271600	5276600	doing the Castlevania one, right? Rumored. But, yeah, well here's more rumor. It was
5276600	5286600	actually in EGM, put up by Wii Fanboy, said that in the September 2008 issue, that there
5286600	5292600	will be one of the most beloved yet overlooked action-adventure franchises of yore will soon
5292600	5302600	get a surprise retro-revival sequel. Hmm. It better not be Bomberman. Still a Bomberman,
5302600	5311600	but we've already had Bomberman. Go Emon! It'll be, um, um, um, what if it was Turtles
5311600	5316600	Tournament Fighter? That would be awesome. They lost the Turtles license to EA. That's
5316600	5324600	right, damn. Or it could be, um, no they lost it, they could be soft. Or it could be, um,
5324600	5332600	Rocky O'Hare! Gradius, since they already said they were gonna do a Gradius a couple
5332600	5338600	of weeks ago. Yeah. Who knows. How about a bunch of stuff? How about Blades of Steel?
5338600	5341600	I'm gonna pretend you just didn't see that. Do not roll your eyes at me, young lady. I
5341600	5347600	love Blades of Steel. That was the first NES hockey game where you could actually fight.
5347600	5351600	Like, not crappy like ice hockey. I'm talking about punching people in the face. That's
5351600	5357600	great. And why else should there be hockey in the world? For blood, because blood bounces
5357600	5363600	on ice. AgDef suggests double dribble. How about Skate or Die? Was that a Konami game?
5363600	5367600	I don't think it was. I think, actually. No, Ultra, it was Ultra games. Yeah, yeah. So
5367600	5374600	that was Skate or Die, hey. Hmm, maybe. We'll see. I don't think they would do that game.
5374600	5380600	A man can dream. I know. Yeah, that's all, unfortunately, it will ever become. Um, but
5380600	5386600	here's some games that will be coming at some point, but they have been rated by the ESRB.
5386600	5392600	Man, you know that ESRB, they still can't quite lock down those games from being announced.
5392600	5398600	Mega Man 1 and 2 have been spotted on there, as well as Earthworm Jim 2, so that's pretty
5398600	5405600	cool. Earthworm Jim. Remember the opening to Earthworm Jim? I love that. Some other things,
5405600	5413600	um, Ys Book 1 and 2 will be coming out, and Samurai Showdown 2. Yes, that was the best
5413600	5422600	one. Wasn't Ys a CD game? Or am I wrong? I would like to say that Ys Book 1 and 2 came
5422600	5430600	out on CD, so the two games were released as a single CD. Have we gotten CD games here
5430600	5435600	yet? Yeah. We have? Oh. They got Dracula X in Japan, didn't they? Yeah, I knew they were
5435600	5440600	coming, I just didn't know we had any yet. That's awesome. But no, the Ys games are good,
5440600	5446600	now I won't. Yeah, I might actually, ugh, I don't have room for Ys. You know what, Rob,
5446600	5452600	I'll tell you what, just come over to my house, we'll hook up the PC Engine. Deal! Anything
5452600	5458600	else, Loki, coming out? That's it. Alright, I thought there might be more. Well, two games
5458600	5462600	coming out very soon that people are very much looking forward to. StarCraft II and
5462600	5468600	Diablo III. Now, you might have heard in last episode or elsewhere around the internet that
5468600	5472600	Wrath of the Lich King, the new Warcraft expansion, is going to be getting an achievement system
5472600	5477600	in the game. Um, achievements for, you know, exploring every zone in the game or completing
5477600	5480600	certain quests or beating certain instances or what have you. Well, here's the kind of
5480600	5484600	interesting thing. Blizzard is creating somewhat of an achievement system of their own because
5484600	5490600	guess what, StarCraft II and Diablo III, yep, they're going to have achievements as well.
5490600	5497600	Every achievement earned is going to go towards this Blizzard level that every Blizzard user
5497600	5501600	is going to use. You could basically think of it like an Xbox Live type thing where you
5501600	5506600	have a gamer score, but now you're going to have a Blizzard level. Definitely a way to
5506600	5509600	kind of tie in all the Blizzard universes together. Because you know there's going to
5509600	5513600	be plenty of people playing all three. I'm not as huge on StarCraft, I might still check
5513600	5518600	it out. Plus, William loves StarCraft. I don't know if you know that. He's not that big of
5518600	5523600	a gamer, but he loves StarCraft. So he is all excited about StarCraft II. So he'll probably
5523600	5526600	make me buy that for him. And then Diablo III I'm excited about because I did like Diablo
5526600	5535600	II quite a bit. Achievement Whore Loki, are you excited? Eh. But you don't really play
5535600	5541600	Blizzard games on the computer, do you? No, I used to. I used to play like, um, what was
5541600	5546600	it? I used to play StarCraft, or not StarCraft, World of Warcraft, not World of Warcraft,
5546600	5552600	Warcraft! The original Warcraft and Diablo. Never played Diablo II though. Should have.
5552600	5557600	It's interesting. I was just looking at a chat room here. Pooface says, too bad the
5557600	5561600	life of a Blizzard game lasts the same of a game console. I don't know, it seems like
5561600	5565600	Blizzard games last a long time. There's still people that frickin' play Diablo II like it
5565600	5570600	just came out yesterday. Lieutenant Pliskin says, achievements are all the rage these
5570600	5575600	days. Yeah, kinda. You see trophies now, and pretty soon I'm sure Nintendo will have something
5575600	5583600	as well, who knows. Well, something else that is pretty, this makes me very, very, very
5583600	5593600	happy. There is a rumor now that Sega is going to be bringing back the Jet Set Radio games.
5593600	5598600	As we know, there was a Dreamcast one, which we actually got as Jet Grind Radio, and then
5598600	5605600	Xbox had Jet Set Radio Future, and then there was a Jet Set Radio for the Game Boy Advance.
5605600	5613600	So, there is definite speculation that Sega is going to be bringing this out, but I'll
5613600	5622600	tell you what's an interesting thing that actually supports this rumor, is that Sega
5622600	5631600	did file a trademark on July 24th, this year, that's separate from their original filing
5631600	5638600	for the Jet Set Radio license. Well, I think Jet Set Radio on the Wii would be a pretty
5638600	5642600	cool thing, don't you? Can you imagine, of course you can do graffiti with the Wii logo.
5642600	5648600	What if we had it on the iPhone? Too tiny, too tiny. Well, they've been quoted as saying,
5648600	5656600	well, the president of Sega is quoted as saying that the iPhone is the new Dreamcast. Interesting.
5656600	5660600	Could you imagine doing your graffiti with your finger? That would be kind of weird to
5660600	5666600	me, I don't know. And fun. Yeah, maybe for a little while, but I don't know. I do hope
5666600	5671600	the rumor is true, though. I don't know if I'd be calling the iPhone the new Dreamcast,
5671600	5676600	that's not a good thing to compare it to. Well, do you have some more news for us, Loki?
5676600	5686600	Yeah. Well, this kind of goes back to the whole story about achievements. With all these
5686600	5690600	different systems coming out with their own achievement and trophy and, you know, whatever
5690600	5695600	systems, there's actually going to be a new site to track all these at the same time.
5695600	5701600	It's actually being created by Rooster Teeth, who you may remember from the Red vs. Blue
5701600	5707600	series, among all their other animated machima series. But now they have a brand new website
5707600	5715600	that's going to database all these, and that site is, what's it called? Small Rewards.
5715600	5720600	Achievement Hunter, I'm sorry. That's what it's called. And right now I know that they
5720600	5727600	were saying that they're going to do the 360, the PS3, and of course the iPhone, and maybe
5727600	5733600	of course they're going to add on these Blizzard ones as well. So, that's pretty cool. They'll
5733600	5736600	have to track all these different sites. I wonder if they're going to have some sort
5736600	5743600	of way to add them all together or something like that. Is that really necessary?
5743600	5745600	Yes, it's very necessary.
5745600	5746600	Actually, it is kind of funny. I don't know why.
5746600	5747600	It is. I think it's hilarious.
5747600	5754600	Darktitsuya says, I'm liking the theme music for stories. You know, I once listened to
5754600	5758600	a gaming podcast, I don't remember who it was, but they actually play music in the background
5758600	5763600	the entire show, which is cool because I think they play mostly indie bands and stuff, and
5763600	5768600	you know, it makes their show unique, so more power to them, but just kind of funny. I never
5768600	5773600	thought of doing theme music for stories. I think it would be cool if we could actually,
5773600	5777600	when we're talking about a certain game, have the music from the game playing in the background,
5777600	5782600	but that takes a lot of coordinated effort, you guys don't even know. I would do it if
5782600	5788600	we could, but in the meantime, you get Monty Python's Flying Circus.
5788600	5795600	I don't know what theme music would be appropriate for this. Maybe something about moving on
5795600	5799600	or something. Wasn't that a DDR song moving on? Penny Arcade Expo is going to the East
5799600	5803600	Coast in 2010. That is the current rumor going around. Actually, it's not really a rumor.
5803600	5809600	Tycho himself has said that Penny Arcade Expo is going to be going to the East Coast, and
5809600	5813600	that doesn't mean that the West Coast show is going to go anywhere. They're turning packs
5813600	5821600	into multiple places at multiple times type events. Apparently, it's quoted by, the Penny
5821600	5826600	Arcade team has been quoted from saying, frankly, it should be global. An East Coast show is
5826600	5830600	only the beginning. So one thing they might announce at Penny Arcade Expo this year is
5830600	5834600	that there's going to be probably an East Coast show next year, and who knows, maybe
5834600	5844600	something in Europe? Canada? Who knows? Somewhere maybe outside the US. Hawaii? Australia?
5844600	5850600	Penny Arcade Expo, Luxembourg. Yes. Penny Arcade, Mozambique. Wouldn't that be fun?
5850600	5859600	Monaco. To Las Vegas or Monaco, win a fortune in the game. My life would never be the same.
5859600	5863600	Rob. Ah yes, let's uh. Let's get this part over with.
5863600	5870600	Yes, it's the mailbag, kids. Every week you email us. Mailbag at orangelauncherator.com.
5870600	5874600	Let's open up the mailbag, see what you guys have to say this week.
5874600	5881600	Oh, did we ever get some doozies? I got to say doozy. Well first of all, this comes from
5881600	5890600	Dave. Hi Dave! Hi Dave. You can't do that, Dave. Sorry. Hey OLR crew, great work on the
5890600	5895600	show. I was wondering if any of you have checked out giantbomb.com, the new website from former
5895600	5901600	game spotter Jeff Gertsman and company. It's basically a potentially awesome game focused
5901600	5906600	wiki. What do you think of it if you've tried it? I'm sure there are tons of randomly awesome
5906600	5912600	games on Sega systems in its desperate need of Dark Sakura's careful attention. Love the
5912600	5917600	show and other nice closing pleasantries. Forgive the shit punctuation. Oh, you're forgiven.
5917600	5923600	Dave from Yeild, England. You're forgiven. Chat room, I'm not stupid. When I said Hawaii
5923600	5929600	being outside the US, I meant continental US, of course. I'm not dumb. Anyhow, sorry,
5929600	5937600	email is giantbomb.com. Yes, I actually did visit it and it's sleek. But here's the thing,
5937600	5943600	if I want game wiki, I usually go to Wikipedia. I'm not exactly sure what is going to make
5943600	5948600	me visit this site on a daily basis, which is what it's all about, right? That's just
5948600	5952600	some friendly feedback. I'm not trying to knock the site or anything because it's rather
5952600	5957600	slick. It's put together rather well and I think they'll get a lot of listeners and certainly
5957600	5960600	they have some knowledgeable people from the gaming industry working for it, but I'm not
5960600	5963600	sure there's anything there just yet that's going to make me want to click reload every
5963600	5967600	six hours. You know what I mean? But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, okay.
5967600	5971600	But there's a lot of neat information on it. Like there's bios that are pretty well written
5971600	5975600	for most big people in the game industry and then it ties into the games that they've done.
5975600	5980600	Um, so if I were looking for specific information that place to go, you know, it does have some
5980600	5984600	advantages over Wikipedia. I'll give it that. It's not, it's not a bad site by any means
5984600	5993600	and it's different. It's something different. So props to them. Next. Yes. Our weekly letter
5993600	6000600	from cheeseburger. You know, you don't have to read every single email. Yes, I do. All
6000600	6005600	right. No, mostly. All right. Hey guys, today I got a subscription to Xbox live with a headset
6005600	6010600	camera and some other stuff including two arcade games. I only have halo three and no
6010600	6014600	arcade games. So what arcade games do you think I should get? I don't like sports and
6014600	6019600	have things like Pac-Man be Jordan Zuma on my iPod. Well, if you were listening to part
6019600	6022600	a, I would tell you to go right now and get geometry wars retro evolve too, because I
6022600	6026600	think it's probably the best game on Xbox live arcade right now. There's symphony of
6026600	6032600	the night. Which is also a great game. Get it. If you don't have a PS1. Get it. Also
6032600	6035600	good games. If you like music games, which a lot of our audience does, I don't know where
6035600	6041600	you stand on that. Not UNO, but Every Extent Extra Extreme, maybe Luminous as well, would
6041600	6047600	both be good things to look into. Luminous is sweet. If you like music games. If you're
6047600	6050600	not so much on music games, if you like role playing games, a penny arcade game is actually
6050600	6055600	pretty low worthy, although it is a little more pricier. But stay away from some of those
6055600	6062600	retro classic change games. I do like the Pac-Man though, tournament edition. Oh god,
6062600	6068600	yes, thank you chat. Run, do not walk, rez HD. Yeah. Which could also very well be the
6068600	6074600	best game on Xbox live arcade. It is a virtual tie with Geometry Wars 2. They are both great.
6074600	6079600	So run, do not walk, rez and Geometry Wars. Pac-Man Championship Edition, honestly. Whether
6079600	6083600	you have the original on your iPhone or not, the act-def, I completely agree with that
6083600	6086600	act-def just saying in chat. It doesn't matter if you already have the original version,
6086600	6090600	it's different enough. The only thing better than that though was the GameCube Pac-Man
6090600	6096600	versus. But you don't get that on Xbox Live, so make do. So next up, Hello Sky, DarkSakura
6096600	6101600	and Loki. Hello emailer. First things first, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy listening
6101600	6105600	to your show. Not all gaming podcasts are created equal, and yours is a testament to
6105600	6110600	that. Thank you. That doesn't necessarily mean we're above the rest, the way that's
6110600	6115600	working. Oh yes we are, hush. So, moving forward, I just wanted to chime in with my opinion
6115600	6120600	on Nintendo and this year's E3. As far as I am concerned, the lukewarm reception Nintendo
6120600	6124600	received was entirely deserving. DarkSakura correctly pointed out that they are a business
6124600	6129600	and their primary concern is making money, but I fear that their current hard-on for
6129600	6135600	casual gamer is going to come back and bite them in the ass. The casual market is supporting
6135600	6139600	them, but it will not sustain them. The Wii has the lowest attach rate of all the current
6139600	6144600	gen consoles. The fact remains that it is still the hardcore gamers who are the lifeblood
6144600	6148600	of the gaming companies. Nintendo has the most loyal fanbase of any of the big three,
6148600	6153600	but if these hardcore fans are made to feel more and more alienated, not all of the Mario
6153600	6157600	and Zelda sequels in the world will keep them from defecting to another camp that can offer
6157600	6162600	them more. And by more, I mean hassle-free online and disk-based storage. As someone
6162600	6166600	who grew up with an NES controller in my hands disappoints me to see Nintendo apparently
6166600	6171600	dropping me for kindergarteners and soccer moms, and I now know I am not alone in this.
6171600	6176600	Loki will back me up, I'm sure. Keep on rocking like the proverbial hurricane, raw fish and
6176600	6181600	beer. This email is brought to you by Mixed Metaphors, home of the ass-biting hard-ons.
6181600	6187600	Really? That's the best home of thing ever.
6187600	6190600	Uh, the beat goes on when Nintendo. Beat goes on.
6190600	6196600	Next up. Hey, O-L-R. Hi. I know Rob is a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and I wanted
6196600	6201600	to know what his reaction was to the news of MTV creating a remake of the classic film.
6201600	6209600	If he didn't know yet, I'm sorry to be the bearer of what I see as terrible news. Harry.
6209600	6218600	Um, yeah, it's, uh, it's, you know, I don't like to judge things until I see them or watch
6218600	6224600	them or play them or whatever, but in this case, you just kinda know. This has, you know,
6224600	6231600	remember the old Animaniacs segment? Good idea, bad idea? Bad idea, this right here.
6231600	6238600	Okay, this is my thought, though. Okay, we saw the redone play, right? Yes. And that
6238600	6249600	was good. Yeah. What if they had it carry, I guess, the updated music of the new play,
6249600	6253600	but keep the feel of the old one? Again, I don't want to judge it until I've seen it.
6253600	6257600	A casting choice is very important as, you know, a lot of it that goes into it, and I
6257600	6261600	don't want to say that everything MTV touches necessarily turns to shit, because, you know,
6261600	6266600	rock band's cool, but then again, this is the network that brought us the hills. I mean,
6266600	6273600	shit, enough said, right? This is the network that started reality TV. I think this is kind
6273600	6280600	of unnecessary, but it's also inevitable at the same time. If it ain't broke, don't remake
6280600	6284600	it. I liked the idea better five years ago when the rumor was that the guy who did Priscilla
6284600	6288600	Queen of the Desert was going to be remaking it with Alan Cumming playing Frank-N-Furter.
6288600	6292600	Oh my god, wouldn't that be great? See, I was totally fine with that. That would just
6292600	6297600	be... Now we're five years later, and the rumor's a little less cool. So, we'll see.
6297600	6305600	SSG100Matt says, OLR needs a Wheel of Morality segment. We do! Wheel of Morality, turn, turn,
6305600	6313600	turn, show us the lesson that we should learn. Love it. Okay, email! Dun dun dun. Yo, OLR,
6313600	6321600	this be the GS68. Um, yo, dude. Okay. Okay, enough of the speaking in GhettoSpeak. In response
6321600	6325600	to Akdeft's call last week, how people who play Rock Band should learn real instruments.
6325600	6330600	I'd like to say that. Ooh, this is bulleted, too. I'm impressed. People who play One Gun
6330600	6335600	or Initial D should invest shitloads of money in a real car and then illegally street race
6335600	6340600	down Highway 101 at 200 miles an hour. People who play Pokeman should capture real animals
6340600	6345600	and train them. Hi, PETA. Well, that's okay. PETA's a bunch of psycho assholes, anyway.
6345600	6350600	People who play GTA should learn to hijack cars and kill people in real life. Hi, um,
6350600	6356600	he who shall not be named. People who play Mulana should explore real life ruins and
6356600	6360600	get killed in the process. People who play Shoot Em Up should invest in a real space
6360600	6366600	fighter jet. Oh, wait, those don't exist. That is all, GS68. PS, this email is brought
6366600	6373600	to you by Tekken, home of the never-ending stages. DJ Ratchet makes a good point going
6373600	6378600	back to the hills. The hills makes the soup funny. That is true. Without MTV, the soup
6378600	6383600	would not be nearly as funny. Oh, yes, to that other email. There's more email. Okay,
6383600	6388600	more email. Um, actually, Robwith2B sent us a couple of stories. Yay! And this one, I
6388600	6398600	think, is hilarious. It's the top seven irritating female characters in video games. So, if the
6398600	6405600	stupid ad would ever disappear, because I fucking hate ads. Oh, you know what, I'm about
6405600	6413600	to just say, screw this, because I hate ads. Stop. Someone's gotta pay the bills. Number
6413600	6423600	seven is Ashley Williams from Mass Effect. Um, I don't know, I didn't play Mass Effect.
6423600	6430600	Six is Minnie Mouse. I guess I'm talking about the- Mickey Mousecapade was awesome. Yeah,
6430600	6440600	Mickey Mousecapade. Screw whoever wrote that. Ashley Graham from Resident Evil 4. Um, moving
6440600	6455600	forward. God, the internet sucks. Sorry. Four is, um, Mikiko Ebihara from Daikatana. And
6455600	6471600	then, um, stupid webpage. Next up is, um, it looks like Catalina from Grand Theft Auto
6471600	6479600	3. And then the Beggar Lady in Assassin's Creed. And then, um, our last one's on the
6479600	6488600	list. Number one is Navi from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Hey, listen. Hey, listen.
6488600	6497600	Hey, listen. Hey, listen. So, uh. Hey, Yuna was not annoying. That was my roommate contributing
6497600	6506600	there, Yuna. That was awful, she needed to die. No. Wow, I think, that's like the first
6506600	6509600	time I think my roommate's kind of gotten into the video game discussion here on the
6509600	6513600	program. Usually, usually he turns his nose up at the show. He's cooking something that
6513600	6518600	smells delightful right outside the door, though. Yeah, what's funny is we have the
6518600	6521600	tornado bringing out, that's how we finally fixed our air conditioning problem. We bought
6521600	6525600	a tornado to suck in air conditioning from the house and blow it out here. But tonight,
6525600	6531600	since the roommate is cooking, it sucks and it blows. His very delightful dish is, uh,
6531600	6536600	we can smell nothing but that out here because it's sucking air from the kitchen. Anyway,
6536600	6544600	sorry. So, um, another one from Rob, um, I haven't really read the article, but he said,
6544600	6549600	um, I got this link in GamePolitics.com, a judge disenfranchises the class in class action
6549600	6554600	suit. And, um, it's about the Grand Theft Auto, um, thing. I'll link it in the chat
6554600	6559600	room. Um, it says, I'm actually a little surprised since the original suit was not over state
6559600	6565600	laws, but just about getting more than he paid for. I'd rather be broke, be broken by
6565600	6571600	providing, by proving the class didn't actually exist. So I'd rather it be broken by proving
6571600	6576600	the class didn't actually exist. I also retract my E3 2008 as boring comment. If you really
6576600	6580600	dig into the third-party games and the, uh, non-big announcements, there are a lot of
6580600	6585600	good information. My original opinion was based, um, all on the A-list games news being
6585600	6591600	leaked to the interwebs. So it was, uh, spoiled for me. Level up, you now have three character
6591600	6596600	points to apply towards your stats, Rob. With two Bs. And I'm just looking at this article
6596600	6603600	real quick. Can I put three points in Awesomeness? Hmm. Okay. Um, it said that the settlement
6603600	6610600	over the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, um, uh, settlement was actually hitting a snag
6610600	6616600	because they're saying on there that the, those who were to benefit from the, uh, that,
6616600	6622600	that class that they're referring to actually isn't there. So, because not everybody knew
6622600	6626600	about it until something came out on the internet. But I'll link this in the chat room. It's
6626600	6632600	an interesting little article. It's, um, for anyone who's interested, just go to, um, it's
6632600	6637600	actually on the, uh, New York Times blog is, uh, where I linked it to me in the technology
6637600	6643600	section. Just look up, um, settlement over sex scenes in Grand Theft Auto hits a snag.
6643600	6649600	I'll link it in the chat room. That's it. All right. If you want to email us, mailbag
6649600	6656600	at orangelaungeradio.com. All right. It's dot com. We have a couple more news articles
6656600	6660600	for you guys, and then we're going to be opening up the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR, username
6660600	6666600	on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Yeah, it's not just coincidence. Well, um, it's only
6666600	6671600	fair since Rock Band's getting really awesome peripherals from a third-party company that
6671600	6677600	Guitar Hero World Tour will get awesome peripherals from a third-party company. The third-party
6677600	6683600	company providing these would be Logitech, and of course they already make the USB microphones
6683600	6689600	that are used by almost, I'd say, almost all of the music games out there right now. And
6689600	6696600	they're going to be doing some high-end guitars and drum sets as well. No word exactly what
6696600	6701600	features these will have, but, you know, if it's Logitech, you can probably guess it's
6701600	6707600	going to be put together at least pretty well. So, um, yeah. I guess we'll just have to
6707600	6716600	wait and see when they show these off. Uh, yay, more peripherals to put on the Best Buy
6716600	6720600	shelves and other gaming stores to take up space. Well, these things are damn expensive.
6720600	6727600	I mean, if it's anything like that $399 drum set, which I do still want, I don't know why
6727600	6732600	because I don't play Rock Band, but I want it anyways. Speaking of music games, I've
6732600	6736600	been kind of brainstorming how I would make a game like Beatmania 2DX work, and I've thought
6736600	6741600	about, like, a game that would combine Beatmania 2DX and Popin' Music. I think it would be
6741600	6748600	actually kind of cool. I just wish I had a game company to make it for me. Moving on,
6748600	6752600	not that anyone cares, but Jamie's going to care about this one. This is a news article
6752600	6758600	just for you, Dark Sakura. Yes, it's about Ragnarok Online. Not just that, but Ragnarok
6758600	6764600	Online DS. Now, here's the thing. This was announced quite some time ago, and now we're
6764600	6768600	starting to wonder, is this game ever going to come out? Well, here's the thing. Ragnarok
6768600	6772600	Online on the DS, it's not actually going to be an MMO. You don't get to play it with
6772600	6775600	other people. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be. Right, and that kind of makes sense, but
6775600	6780600	it is going to be a single-player role-playing game that apparently has some online features
6780600	6786600	in it, whatever that means. Some screenshots have come out for the game this week as well,
6786600	6789600	and it does have that same chibi style that you've come to know and love from the original
6789600	6794600	Ragnarok Online. I looked at the pictures and I saw a bunny band. Apparently you do
6794600	6798600	have gestural attack inputs. You use the stylus to kind of draw your attacks and things like
6798600	6804600	that. December 18th is the day this comes out overseas. Import! Yep, I bet you will.
6804600	6808600	You know I will. I know you will. Whether or not I can read most of it or not. You know
6808600	6813600	what I know will happen right now is that we are going to open up the Skype line at
6813600	6818600	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and we're going to take a few calls
6818600	6822600	here on this Part B of our show tonight. We actually kind of jammed through the stories
6822600	6826600	part of our show tonight. It's only about 815 on the West Coast. That's not bad! Because
6826600	6830600	here we've got a 10 minute late start tonight. Oh, I thought you said on the East Coast,
6830600	6834600	I'm like, wait, what? No, no, no, 815 here, but usually we don't get to the Skype line
6834600	6839600	until like 9 o'clock, so we're doing good tonight. 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype,
6839600	6842600	Orange Lounge Radio, it's not ringing right now, so Loki, do you have any last minute,
6842600	6846600	or I should start with Dark Soccer, do you have any last minute stories for us? Um, no,
6846600	6853600	not really. Uh, Loki? Um, I haven't really been looking at last minute stories. Oh, here's
6853600	6860600	some, yay. Um, Sony's Life, you may remember that, um, as the, their version of the globe
6860600	6867600	spinning news thing, so that's not coming out right away. It's been delayed. Wow, surprise.
6867600	6874600	Sony delaying something? Yeah. Anyways. Rock Band, download content. We've got some stuff
6874600	6879600	coming out this week, including, uh, Crewfest Pack 2, and we're going to be getting with
6879600	6885600	that, uh, Face Down in the Dirt by Motley Crue for 80 points or a dollar. Um, Rescue
6885600	6892600	Me by Buck Cherry, another 80 points or a dollar, and Life is Beautiful by 6 AM, and
6892600	6897600	that's also 80 points or a dollar, whole pack for 240 or 3 bucks. And then each, um, they're
6897600	6902600	going to have individual songs for BYOB from System of a Down for 2 bucks, and Toxicity
6902600	6907600	from System of a Down, also 2 bucks, and you might remember those were part of the System
6907600	6913600	of a Down exclusive download content for when you, um, bought their album, so that's kind
6913600	6921600	of interesting. And, um, you remember there's a game coming out called Last Guy on the PlayStation
6921600	6925600	Network, and what's interesting about this game is it's actually very similar to a game
6925600	6929600	that came out on WTF, the PSP game. Well, they have a website where you can play it
6929600	6935600	on any URL, which is kind of cool, and of course it's lastguy.jp, go there and you can...
6935600	6936600	Does it work on our own website?
6936600	6937600	It'll work on any website.
6937600	6939600	Would it be fun on our website?
6939600	6940600	Um...
6940600	6941600	Let's check it out.
6941600	6944600	Yeah, lastguy.jp.
6944600	6946600	Alright.
6946600	6947600	And, uh...
6947600	6951600	Skypline's open and no one's calling, that's weird. I just checked it to make sure it works.
6951600	6954600	I called 1877 Game OLR. Well, it happens sometimes.
6954600	6955600	Yeah, because I was...
6955600	6956600	I was supposed to just quiet.
6956600	6960600	I was supposed to be looking up, um, you know, stories, but I was working on trying to get
6960600	6964600	the Wiimotes to work with that Love is Blind game, you know, the one that makes the sex
6964600	6966600	noises, but, uh...
6966600	6971600	Apparently my Bluetooth adapter says, fuck you, Wiimote, I ain't working with you, bitch.
6971600	6972600	And so...
6972600	6975600	Aw, so now we get to play the chat, uh, the sex game?
6975600	6978600	No, we can, we can. They have a keyboard version too, so...
6978600	6979600	Oh, well, hooray.
6979600	6981600	It's just not quite, you know, as...
6981600	6982600	That's a little bonus thing after the show, right?
6982600	6983600	Yes.
6983600	6984600	Okay, that sounds good.
6984600	6989600	I found, by accident, I found a funny MMO that's, um, all about, uh, getting laid.
6989600	6991600	And partying.
6991600	6992600	Right.
6992600	6995600	It's like some sort of social networking thing, but I thought it was hilarious.
6995600	6997600	It was called Red Light Center.
6997600	6999600	I just thought it was funny.
6999600	7002600	I don't think I'm going to play it, but I think it was funny.
7002600	7006600	Yeah, so, um...
7006600	7007600	Yeah, that's pretty much...
7007600	7012600	The only other story I had was Ubisoft's localizing Armored Core 4 answer for the US,
7012600	7014600	and it should be coming out in September.
7014600	7016600	And that's kind of cool, I guess.
7016600	7019600	Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by Armored Core 4.
7019600	7021600	I don't know if I'll pick this up.
7021600	7022600	Probably not.
7022600	7024600	But...
7024600	7025600	I don't know.
7025600	7026600	Can't get too excited anymore.
7026600	7027600	I used to love Armored Core games.
7027600	7030600	I used to buy every single one that came out, but...
7030600	7031600	Oh, well.
7031600	7035600	Oh, I guess I did miss a game that was supposed to be coming out on the Wii and DS this week.
7035600	7038600	Little League World Series 2008.
7038600	7039600	I know. Sad.
7039600	7041600	Oh, and this week on Xbox Live Arcade.
7041600	7044600	We've got Braid for, like, 15 bucks.
7044600	7045600	Is that game supposed to be cool?
7045600	7046600	It looks kind of neat from the previews.
7046600	7047600	It's supposed to be pretty cool.
7047600	7048600	You can kind of, like, it's...
7048600	7052600	Imagine, like, a 2D platform game with the sands of time built into it.
7052600	7053600	All right.
7053600	7055600	Finally, our phone's ringing.
7055600	7056600	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
7056600	7057600	Who's this?
7057600	7059600	It's a dead, tired Rama.
7059600	7060600	Hey, Rama.
7060600	7064600	You know, and I'm kind of glad somebody called, even if, you know, you call us quite often.
7064600	7066600	Are you looking at Justin.tv, by the way?
7066600	7072600	Actually, I'm not because I just got off the bus ride from hell about 40 minutes ago.
7072600	7076600	I'm wearing your shirt that you got when you were out here in California, the one you bought.
7076600	7078600	Give me a second.
7078600	7080600	Let me fire it up and see what you got over there.
7080600	7081600	Well, no rush.
7081600	7083600	I'll still be here after we hang up.
7083600	7084600	What's on your mind?
7084600	7087600	You went to a con because you've been sending me pictures.
7087600	7089600	Yeah, did you like the pictures I sent?
7089600	7091600	Yes, they're really hard to see on my phone.
7091600	7095600	I liked them because you sent me Knights or Riala, one of them.
7095600	7096600	I think I sent you both.
7096600	7098600	I got a Frank-N-Furter one.
7098600	7100600	I know.
7100600	7102600	I see Scott.
7102600	7103600	I also got a Bubble Bobble.
7103600	7104600	Heart.
7104600	7105600	There you go.
7105600	7106600	Heart.
7106600	7107600	Right, I heart and why.
7107600	7108600	There you have it.
7108600	7110600	All right, so how was the con?
7110600	7112600	What con was it you went to?
7112600	7113600	It was called what?
7113600	7114600	Kinetic Con.
7114600	7115600	Kinetic Con.
7115600	7117600	How was that?
7117600	7120600	Much better than I thought it was.
7120600	7125600	It gave me a Fonami feel to it, so you know what that means, I'll be going back to that convention next year.
7125600	7127600	Fonami is a good time.
7127600	7132600	Fonami is a great con.
7132600	7138600	I got there late Friday night because I had to work and I missed my bus, but I got there Saturday.
7138600	7139600	I left my camera.
7139600	7141600	It showed up an hour later.
7141600	7146600	It wasn't as packed, but it was just really roomy, really flowing.
7146600	7150600	And then when I got to the room, my roommate tells me, oh, there's going to be furries here.
7150600	7152600	What?
7152600	7155600	That was exactly my reaction.
7155600	7160600	Correct me if I'm wrong, Rama, but did you not say that you missed the bus?
7160600	7162600	Yeah, getting Friday I missed the bus.
7162600	7167600	I was stuck waiting at Greyhound for almost an hour to get my ticket changed.
7167600	7170600	Ha ha ha ha.
7170600	7174600	I see what you did there, sir.
7174600	7176600	I missed the bus.
7176600	7177600	I couldn't help it, I'm sorry.
7177600	7181600	I know it's probably not funny, but in years you'll look back and laugh at it.
7181600	7183600	It's all good, man.
7183600	7186600	It's all good.
7186600	7192600	Well, I have to ask, what gaming things were going on at the convention?
7192600	7195600	Would you believe I saw DDR?
7195600	7196600	At an anime convention?
7196600	7198600	DDR you don't say?
7198600	7201600	First I was seen in like five cons.
7201600	7203600	Was there Smash Brothers?
7203600	7205600	Yes, there was.
7205600	7207600	I'll be damned.
7207600	7211600	Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. Was there Guitar Hero?
7211600	7212600	Yes, there was.
7212600	7214600	I'm on a fucking roll. Look at this. I'm like the psychic con man.
7214600	7216600	Here's the fun thing to ask was if there was...
7216600	7220600	Was there a Naruto game?
7220600	7223600	Actually, not in the dealer's room.
7223600	7227600	One of the gaming dealers was showing off one of the Naruto games for PlayStation 2.
7227600	7229600	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
7229600	7233600	Psychic con man, hold on, hold on.
7233600	7241600	Was there a woman overweight dressed to Sailor Moon?
7241600	7242600	No.
7242600	7244600	Ah, I lose.
7244600	7248600	That's impossible. That's a prerequisite for any con.
7248600	7251600	Did you have Manfay? I miss Manfay.
7251600	7254600	God, no. I think we shoot him.
7254600	7258600	All right. Anything else you want to share with the listeners, Rama?
7258600	7261600	There was beat mania, I tell you that much.
7261600	7263600	Oh, all right.
7263600	7270600	And one thing I loved about the con was they had a place set up in the convention where you could actually sit down and eat on tables.
7270600	7277600	Wow. Ooh, Frisbee asked a good question. Was there an overweight man dressed to Sailor Moon?
7277600	7281600	Actually, no. Believe it or not, there really wasn't any overweight people.
7281600	7284600	There was, but most of them were wearing Lolita outfits.
7284600	7285600	Con fails.
7285600	7286600	Con fails.
7286600	7292600	Metacon is a combination of a, it's a majority of a webcomic convention with anime, sci-fi, fantasy.
7292600	7294600	That sounds like fun.
7294600	7295600	Yeah, it does.
7295600	7298600	I forget his name, but the guy that played Neelix on Voyager was there as well.
7298600	7299600	Cool.
7299600	7300600	Ethan something isn't his name?
7300600	7301600	I wanted his own.
7301600	7302600	Yes.
7302600	7304600	You didn't give me his autograph, did you?
7304600	7307600	I had no money.
7307600	7310600	I didn't even know he was there until I showed up Saturday.
7310600	7312600	Okay, I forgive you.
7312600	7314600	There's a, you know, if you go to...
7314600	7317600	You didn't give me your ominous autograph. I mean, that shouldn't be something.
7317600	7320600	I know, I found my book. Finally, I found my book.
7320600	7321600	Woot.
7321600	7324600	Yes, dear Richard, there was anime. Tons of it.
7324600	7326600	I'll be sending you my book.
7326600	7328600	Rama, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, okay?
7328600	7329600	You too, all right.
7329600	7330600	Later.
7330600	7332600	That's great.
7332600	7334600	Something tells me the callers are fairly apathetic tonight.
7334600	7337600	Thank you, Ethan Phillips is his game guru. That's his name.
7337600	7340600	The other one, you know what, Tuvok is from Sacramento, so you sometimes catch,
7340600	7343600	I've never seen him, but I see stories about him on the local news once in a while.
7343600	7347600	You know, celebrity Tim something, what's his name?
7347600	7349600	Tim something?
7349600	7351600	What the hell is Tuvok's name? I don't remember.
7351600	7352600	Oh well.
7352600	7353600	Let's go to the phone so we have another call.
7353600	7355600	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
7355600	7357600	Oh my god, we got through.
7357600	7358600	Yes, we did.
7358600	7359600	Hi.
7359600	7361600	Whoa, we've got like a party chat on the line.
7361600	7363600	Introduce yourselves.
7363600	7366600	Wow, this is like a party line from like the 80s or something.
7366600	7367600	I know.
7367600	7368600	Let's call anything.
7368600	7370600	It's party chat.
7370600	7372600	We should meet up at Chuck E. Cheese afterwards.
7372600	7375600	Who's on the line?
7375600	7379600	We've got Toshin, Footy Monster, Jack Ransom, and the Rod D.
7379600	7382600	Wow, it's like an all-games party line.
7382600	7383600	It is a party line.
7383600	7384600	Awesome.
7384600	7385600	Call 1-900.
7385600	7386600	Here to call.
7386600	7387600	1-900.
7387600	7389600	I'm around, it's always a party. That's the way it rolls.
7389600	7392600	What do we owe this phone call tonight?
7392600	7395600	I just wanted to say I beat your deadline score on Geometry Wars and you're going down.
7395600	7396600	F you.
7396600	7399600	F you.
7399600	7401600	I just did, like five seconds ago.
7401600	7405600	Geometry Wars brings out the most competitive in all of us, doesn't it?
7405600	7406600	Yeah.
7406600	7407600	How about my pacifism score?
7407600	7408600	It's Geometry Wars, baby.
7408600	7412600	Dude, I played pacifism for an hour trying to get that stupid wax off achievement.
7412600	7414600	Have you beat my pacifism score?
7414600	7416600	Um, I don't think so.
7416600	7419600	Well, at least I'm still cool at something.
7419600	7423600	Yeah, but I bumped up my, uh, I know everybody's probably shut up about Geometry Wars,
7423600	7426600	but I'm up to five million for my deadline.
7426600	7429600	Did you hear about the Easter egg in Geometry Wars,
7429600	7431600	that at any point during the game you don't even have to pause it?
7431600	7435600	You just hit the right bumper and back, and then if you use the sticks,
7435600	7438600	the both analog sticks, the game is rendered in 3D.
7438600	7440600	It's crazy.
7440600	7443600	It's so crazy, like, you don't pause the game at all,
7443600	7446600	just while you're playing it hit the right bumper, not the trigger, but the bumper,
7446600	7449600	hit right bumper and the back button, and you can, like, render the field in 3D.
7449600	7451600	It's so cool.
7451600	7453600	And then if you touch the dot in the room with the dragon ducks,
7453600	7456600	then you can see, created by Warren Robinette, and it's awesome.
7456600	7458600	It's like that.
7458600	7460600	Oh, God.
7460600	7461600	But in 3D, dude.
7461600	7462600	That's awesome.
7462600	7463600	3D.
7463600	7465600	How do you get, how do you go back?
7465600	7467600	Because now it's in the moment of my game.
7467600	7469600	Uh, hit right bumper and back again.
7469600	7471600	Okay, oh, okay, there we go.
7471600	7473600	Wow, you're playing Geometry Wars while you talk to us?
7473600	7474600	That's very impressive.
7474600	7475600	I know.
7475600	7477600	So what about the other folks on the line?
7477600	7479600	He's a savant of Geometry Wars.
7479600	7482600	Are you guys playing Geometry Wars, or are you guys playing?
7482600	7487600	Well, I can't play anything anymore, because my 360 died after five months,
7487600	7488600	so I can't play anything.
7488600	7490600	So, nephew of the week.
7490600	7493600	Being in Argentina, you're kind of screwed, huh?
7493600	7494600	I'm totally screwed.
7494600	7497600	I called Microsoft, they said basically, well, fuck you, we don't care.
7497600	7499600	And, uh, yeah.
7499600	7501600	So I'm out of 500 bucks and a 360.
7501600	7502600	It's awesome.
7502600	7503600	That sucks.
7503600	7505600	That is crappy customer service.
7505600	7507600	I mean, I understand you're at a regional, I didn't really do business with it.
7507600	7510600	I tried, I tried messaging, like, through Twitter to Major Nelson.
7510600	7512600	He tried my luck there.
7512600	7513600	Of course, nothing happened.
7513600	7516600	Well, yeah, he probably gets 500 emails a day.
7516600	7517600	Sucks, though.
7517600	7520600	I will say this before I end my part of talking here,
7520600	7523600	because I know you probably have a lot more calls to take.
7523600	7524600	Actually, not really tonight.
7524600	7528600	But, uh, Rhythm Heaven or Rhythm Tengoku Gold on the DS,
7528600	7530600	you guys need to play that.
7530600	7536600	I know there's a lot of rhythm fans, you know, in the audience, rhythm game fans.
7536600	7537600	You need to play that.
7537600	7541600	It's like the WarioWare game of rhythm games, and it's so fun.
7541600	7542600	Ooh, I like WarioWare.
7542600	7545600	Tell us really quickly, is that what the game's like, WarioWare?
7545600	7551600	It's, yeah, I imagine, uh, each stage, four, five minigames per stage,
7551600	7553600	with a final stage being a remix,
7553600	7558600	each game is totally different in gameplay, and it's a small song, or a small thingy.
7558600	7561600	And from that, you advance the remix stage,
7561600	7565600	and in the remix you play all those minigames crumpled together into one cohesive song.
7565600	7568600	So you gotta switch gameplays on the fly all the time.
7568600	7571600	And it goes like that for many, many levels, and it's so fun.
7571600	7577600	Great music, really catchy, the action on the stylus works perfectly, and it's so fun.
7577600	7580600	Alright, sounds pretty cool, I will have to look at that.
7580600	7587600	Yeah, I've just been playing an old copy of Super Robot Wars Alpha I got from a friend a while ago,
7587600	7591600	since I'll be going to Otacon next week to see Jam Project.
7591600	7594600	And actually, I'm gonna meet up with Rama, probably.
7594600	7598600	He didn't even know it was too lame to go, even though Rama and I offered to pay his way.
7598600	7601600	Aww. What?
7601600	7602600	Yep.
7602600	7605600	Sorry, I have to reflect on that. That's horrible.
7605600	7609600	What about games you've been playing, JackRansom?
7609600	7614600	Well, my PSP miraculously, after a year and a half, fixed itself this weekend,
7614600	7617600	so I decided I'd go out and pick up Patapon.
7617600	7619600	Pata-pata-pata-pon!
7619600	7622600	Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom. That game is nuts!
7622600	7626600	Oh, my friend is freaking nuts, and I absolutely love it.
7626600	7629600	I actually got how many goddamn great games there were on the PSP.
7629600	7633600	You start hearing those little drum beats in your sleep if you've played that game long enough.
7633600	7635600	It's terrible. You're lying there, trying to go to sleep, and then,
7635600	7639600	PON PON PATA PON PON PON PON PON PON PON PON.
7639600	7642600	I cannot wait to get to that stage, because at the moment, I need more of that game.
7642600	7645600	I want more of that game. I'm loving it.
7645600	7648600	Hooray for a PSP getting a lot of good games lately. It's great.
7648600	7649600	Certainly.
7649600	7650600	All right, well, guys...
7650600	7651600	Hooray for the Summer of Arcade...
7651600	7653600	Sorry, go ahead, Toushin, real quick.
7653600	7657600	I said Summer of Arcade for Xbox Live. I'm going to be broke. That's all I'm saying.
7657600	7661600	For real. I don't know about that Braid game. I'll have to check out the demo first, because I haven't heard much about it.
7661600	7662600	I'm skipping that.
7662600	7665600	But the rest of that looks great. I know, I'm going to be broke.
7665600	7670600	Playing Bionic Force next week. Galaga Legion's the next. I need money.
7670600	7673600	You know what, though? If you add it all up, it's the price of, like, Soul Calibur IV.
7673600	7675600	So, honestly, it's, you know...
7675600	7679600	That also kicks ass. I highly recommend that for all the Soul Calibur fans.
7679600	7681600	Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD coming.
7681600	7683600	Oh, yes. Hopefully soon.
7683600	7687600	Toushin, we need to play custom characters in Soul Calibur IV. Soon.
7687600	7689600	You going to be around later? Because I'm around.
7689600	7693600	I might. I have a wow date after the show, but maybe later.
7693600	7694600	We'll talk.
7694600	7697600	All right. Take care, guys. I've got to let you go. We're going to wrap up the show. Have a good one, though.
7697600	7698600	All right.
7698600	7700600	Bye, Party Chat.
7702600	7703600	That's great.
7704600	7708600	It's like we leveled up together. It was a party adventure.
7708600	7712600	All right. We're going to go around to this point and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap it up for tonight.
7712600	7714600	Let's go ahead and start with...
7714600	7717600	And when I say a wow date, I don't mean, like, I'm literally going on a date in wow.
7717600	7720600	I mean, I have an appointment or whatever you want to call it.
7720600	7722600	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
7722600	7723600	Ouch.
7724600	7727600	My final thought is paper cuts really suck.
7728600	7729600	Loki, your final thought?
7730600	7733600	Red Bull BC one's actually pretty good on the DS.
7734600	7735600	All right.
7735600	7740600	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading Orange Launch Radio Independent Podcasting.
7740600	7746600	Remember, the only way we survive is that you guys tell two friends about our show and the word continues to travel throughout the galaxy.
7746600	7749600	And one day, Yoda and Darth Vader will be in our show.
7750600	7751600	Or not.
7751600	7753600	But anyhow, tune in. We'll be back next week.
7753600	7755600	It's two weeks that we're going to be off.
7755600	7756600	Next week, we will be back here.
7756600	7760600	The All Games Listener Appreciation Month should be in full swing by next week.
7760600	7764600	I can tell you there will be a prize token given away to live listeners.
7764600	7767600	We will also have a way you can enter over email, so stay tuned for that.
7767600	7768600	It's going to be a lot of fun.
7768600	7773600	And we'll be seeing those of you that are going to PAX four weeks away, if you can believe it.
7773600	7775600	We're going to PAX.
7775600	7777600	We're going to have some seafood and maybe play some video games.
7778600	7779600	And?
7779600	7780600	And.
7780600	7781600	I have to look around the city.
7781600	7783600	And we need some coffee.
7783600	7784600	Lots of it.
7784600	7787600	And we are going to be going to Space Needle at some point.
7787600	7788600	Yes.
7788600	7789600	I have to.
7789600	7790600	And I want it to rain.
7790600	7791600	And I'm going to try to push Loki off the Space Needle.
7791600	7792600	And I want it to rain.
7792600	7793600	Yes.
7793600	7794600	Come on, Loki.
7794600	7795600	Sounds awesome.
7795600	7796600	Alright.
7796600	7797600	Alright, have a good one everybody.
7797600	7798600	Thank you so much.
7798600	7823600	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7828600	7830600	See you next week.
