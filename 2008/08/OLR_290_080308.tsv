13985	19552	Tonight, August 3, 2008, will Nintendo's latest move in court stop DS piracy?
19952	22535	Is Jet Set Radio making a comeback on the Wii?
22816	27101	And rumors abound about the Xbox 360 getting a price cut next month.
31997	33678	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
33698	35860	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35880	41584	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41644	42765	My name is Rob Roberts.
43026	46788	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47129	47729	Roar.
47969	48690	Roar.
48930	50111	Beware, I hunger.
50651	51612	No, I'm not hunger.
52693	54494	I'm full of tasty epic salad.
54714	56196	So then we should not beware.
57036	58297	We should be... Oh, you should beware.
59178	59838	Beware of what?
60279	60899	Beware of what?
61660	61700	Um...
62842	65224	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
90239	90599	My mistake.
90639	92840	No, I don't think a milkshake is a part of a good diet.
93661	95882	Actually, milkshakes can be very good for you if you do them right.
96522	98924	Well, I doubt Jack in the Box does them the healthy way.
99244	99824	Call it a hunch.
100164	105107	With no sugar added ice cream and protein powder and low fat milk.
106327	107368	Then it's only half bad.
108499	109139	It's very healthy.
109219	110440	Give good dairy.
110820	112420	I just finished my nutrition class.
112781	114121	Orange Lounge Foodio, everybody.
114821	115362	Welcome to it.
116122	117802	Anyhow, let's talk about games.
117942	120143	We always start off the show with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week.
120223	122184	First, though, let me introduce the one and only chat room.
122564	127486	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be if you're listening live on this Sunday evening, August 3rd of 2008, for our 290th show.
130547	132509	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
154306	154866	Pretty, yes.
154946	157687	Rob, this has been the last week of class.
157707	159587	It's a fair question, yes or no?
159807	159987	No.
160408	165749	This has been the last week of class for me, so I actually took my final on Saturday morning and then played.
165849	166749	I took a hooky day, though.
167829	168650	What'd you do with hooky day?
169230	169910	Watched movies.
169970	171670	But you didn't play Soul Calibur, fail.
172851	173411	No, I didn't.
173471	173991	I'm just kidding.
174351	177052	But, but, but, but, but, I did play some Portal.
177652	178132	And how was that?
178752	179452	Portal-rific.
179652	180132	All right.
180553	181913	And, of course, Ragnarok.
182699	185721	I have a story just for you later tonight.
185781	187563	I downloaded a game for my phone.
187723	189044	I downloaded a Sudoku game.
190205	191566	I've been playing Sudoku on my phone.
191886	192246	Why?
193187	195369	How bored have you been on a scale of 1 to 10?
195789	196429	It's actually kind of fun.
196449	198031	Keep in mind you can only use each number once.
198471	199272	It's actually kind of fun.
200232	202654	Just for something when you've got three minutes to kill.
203395	205396	Sudoku is a huge time waster.
206197	207798	But that's it.
207978	208719	It's a time waster.
209565	212647	If you're looking to waste time, at least try to put your brain to work, right?
212687	214407	I guess that's what most any game's for, right?
215668	216829	I don't know.
217309	217949	What about this show?
219430	219930	Hey, wait a minute.
221471	222351	Is that it for your gaming week?
222551	223372	Yes, Rob.
223412	224772	Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?
225833	228414	I didn't play that many games this week, actually.
228534	230575	I only played Grand Theft Auto 4.
231235	233597	I meant to play a bunch of stuff this week, but never got around to it.
234197	234757	Grand Theft Auto 4 and...
237762	240105	The Shit Game, but we'll talk about that later.
253257	253557	All right.
254118	254558	It's so much fun.
282575	283496	Thanks for watching!
298248	301450	have the bonus characters, Yoda and Starkiller.
301510	306193	You can't use them, or the Apprentice, as he's called in the game, which makes him sound like a Donald Trump flunky.
306613	311696	But Starkiller from The Force Unleashed, you can't customize characters based off of them, which sucks.
311936	319381	Because I would have loved to have made... I can understand Yoda, because it's kind of hard to base characters off Yoda, unless you can have midget fighters.
319861	321442	Which would be an awesome fighting game, by the way.
321462	326705	I was just thinking that you should totally make your Final Fantasy XI character, Lil' Kim...
328765	331326	I could, but only if I could do Yoda, because she was very tiny.
331646	332606	That's what I was going to say.
333006	334727	I mean, if you could do the midget size.
334927	337327	Well, I made Sassy Pants, my Warcraft character.
337467	338848	I made her based off Young Sung.
338868	340888	She's the chick with the giant afro, and she's quite sassy.
341608	342368	And very cool.
342388	350490	And I also made a male guy based off of... He kind of looks like Robin from the old school, because he has the little mask and very vibrant colors.
350810	353491	But he's based off of Tira, who's the hula hoop girl.
353511	353591	Yeah.
355342	357103	I love customization modes.
357344	357984	It's great.
358004	360286	That's the only reason why I would play wrestling games.
361227	363568	To make my own character.
374289	376010	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
402557	405279	But no, we had a lot of fun playing Soul Calibur.
405819	407861	Here's the things I don't like about Soul Calibur.
408341	410202	I actually like the Star Wars characters.
410362	413625	I don't know why people are so like, oh, they throw things off balance.
413765	418208	I've never been that hardcore into Soul Calibur, so I don't study the game mechanics or the science.
418808	419569	I think it's fun.
420009	420269	Deal.
420469	423531	I especially think Starkiller is a great, great character.
423871	424832	I love playing as him.
425172	427274	So he's awesome to get in the game.
427314	428775	By the way, if you want to unlock him, you have to...
429476	431827	Beat Arcade Mode with Yoda or I imagine Vader on the 360.
432048	432992	So there you have it.
434764	437545	I think he's a great addition on the PS3.
438045	439845	So I like playing as him.
439985	440905	I like the new characters.
441325	443646	What I don't like, I don't like the single player modes.
444026	447947	Story mode is very, very short, which is fine because it doesn't need to go on forever.
448367	459309	But climbing the tower up and down mode, which is basically just an excuse to fight five people all at once in a row and unlock...
459969	460890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
475610	481213	I am hearing, and I do see it a little bit, that some of the game mechanics of some of the old characters kind of got screwed up a little bit.
481493	488657	Like, for instance, Shaoran in chat, Shaoran, sorry, says Talim got slightly less hot between 2 and 3, and she plays a little different, too.
488697	491878	And Ivy, I noticed, especially, plays, like, different.
492078	492859	It's hard to explain.
493739	496741	But some characters I still have a lot of fun with, like Zalasamel.
496841	497441	I love him.
497501	498041	He's awesome.
498161	499882	I want to make one that's more foul than Voldo.
502271	503192	It's probably possible.
503512	505254	Here's the other interesting thing about the Soul Calibur.
505954	510699	The online content, some of it is available and you can download for just 100 Microsoft points.
510739	516144	You can get some extra customization, which is basically like old costumes.
516745	520909	And the cool thing is you can actually customize the existing characters, like change the colors of their outfits and stuff.
520929	521630	So that's kind of neat.
522290	523752	It is pay to unlock content, though.
524172	524692	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
547788	548669	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
574949	576310	Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 on the Xbox 360
601189	605991	Which, I would say, is the best game on Xbox Live Arcade right now.
606392	607412	I think it's great.
607932	614095	And even though they upped the price from $5 to $10, I think it's a heck of a deal because you get six different modes in the game.
614496	617277	I have been playing pacifism mode so much.
617757	621919	Like, that mode is fun, and it's weird because you don't even shoot in that mode.
621939	623879	You just fly around the screen dodging enemies.
624360	633003	But it's so disgustingly simple, like the old Atari 2600 games and the old 80s games that was just, you know, shoot things, don't get hit.
633103	633523	That's it.
633603	634243	It's so simple.
634563	638385	That's one of the reasons I think I love Geometry Wars, is it really kind of, kind of...
639557	644179	I don't know, kind of recalls those days of the past with these very simple video games.
644499	647460	And you practically have like six different games in a way kind of in there.
647780	650501	And I really like the way they've incorporated the leaderboard into the game.
650741	653682	They've basically made the game all about beating your friends.
654262	656043	The achievements are interesting.
656163	658404	They're a lot easier to get than they were in Geometry Wars 1.
658984	663125	But like, you know, like for instance, there's these two achievements, Wax On and Wax Off.
663445	664786	And you do it in pacifism mode.
665126	665366	And you...
665946	670970	Wax On is circling around the screen touching every wall.
671270	678335	But as you start to do it, then the game realizes you're going through the achievement and it starts lighting up the wall on how much of it you've circled.
678595	684039	And then Wax Off is doing the same thing twice, which is kind of hard to do when pacifism mode gets going.
684459	684739	So I
685680	688202	I was pretty impressed by how they kind of worked in the achievements.
688322	691324	I like that they made it very competitive with a friend's leaderboard.
691825	699931	And I got to try multiplayer, which sadly is not on Xbox Live because we all know that's what they're going to do for Retro Evolved 3, I'm sure, to make that fresh.
701432	701872	Retro Evolved 2
724113	724714	I think it's great.
725355	726918	I highly recommend Geometry Wars 2.
727099	729924	If you even like shooters in the slightest, it's a great deal at $10.
730525	732929	I know the price went up, but you get six different games now.
733290	734352	It's worth it.
734452	734853	Check it out.
735053	735835	Highly, highly recommend.
737340	762118	so that's besides Final Fantasy 4 and Warcraft and the usual affair that's pretty much it for my gaming week but those two are the new new games I've been playing looking at comments in the chat room GS68 says Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 sequence mode is reminding me of Giga Wing Son of Dad says Giga Wing should be on Xbox Live Arcade along with Mars Matrix as if there weren't enough shooters on Xbox Live Arcade Mars Matrix was a cool game though
763396	764278	I don't know much about that.
764318	767023	You're going to have to... I've got it somewhere.
767063	768826	I'll have to hook up the Dreamcast.
768846	769106	All right.
769627	770208	You'll have to do that.
771351	774252	Anyhow, let's talk about a little bit of housekeeping tonight.
774932	779794	First off in housekeeping, it is All Games Listener Appreciation Month.
780494	785776	And during All Games Listener Appreciation Month, we're going to be giving away free shit to our listeners.
786156	796079	Here's the thing, you're going to win tokens this month that will allow you to basically kind of enter a larger contest going on at allgames.com where you can win prizes.
796099	799180	They're talking about giving away like game systems and games.
799460	799921	Thanks for watching!
823764	826685	We will not be live in two weeks since this is housekeeping.
826725	830166	There will be no live show Sunday, August 17th.
830206	833047	This is the first time actually the folks in studio are hearing about this too.
833687	834908	Surprise, Loki and DarkSakura.
834928	835668	I heard about it earlier.
835788	837549	Well, because you were here nice and early this week.
837589	838229	That's because I was.
838249	842090	So I got to fill you in, but Loki ran through the door at the last minute and I neglected to tell him.
842370	844131	Last minute, but like a half an hour.
844491	845091	Well, I forgot.
845191	845531	I forgot.
846132	846592	Here's the thing.
848914	853155	I don't talk about my personal life too much, but this is too funny to pass up.
853395	855056	I've been seeing William for a year and a half now.
855296	858137	The thing about William and I is that we're both really big nerds.
858537	864839	We actually spent our first anniversary, we actually drove down to Long Beach and went to the Star Trek tour at the Queen Mary.
865079	866319	That's how big nerds we are.
867099	867599	Here's the thing.
867879	872281	We've always talked about how we're going to go to the Star Trek experience because I haven't been since I was 25.
874041	876782	Right before I started working at my current job, so it was about seven years ago.
877142	879723	So it was a long time ago when I was last at the Star Trek experience.
880023	883904	And we keep talking about how we're going to go back, we're going to go back, because I've never ridden the Borg 4D ride.
884384	889646	Well, then I read on the internet last night they are shutting down the Star Trek experience on September 1st.
890586	891587	Which is so sad.
891807	894009	I don't know why they would shut that down.
894049	894669	It's so cool.
895930	900373	So it really lit a fire under our ass to go to the Star Trek experience before it closes.
900694	910821	But because of Penny Arcade Expo, because of some other commitment I have in Reno in three weeks, because of the fact there's a huge convention in Vegas next week, it really only made sense.
911001	912202	We have to go to Vegas in two weeks.
912523	915305	So we booked a trip and we're going to Vegas in two weeks.
915865	916846	Very last minute trip.
916966	917706	Thank you to the...
918567	919847	Various websites online.
919907	924108	So, yes, I am a giant nerd going to the Star Trek experience in Vegas in two weeks.
924368	925208	So there won't be a live show.
925228	926188	We might pre-tape something.
926228	926609	I don't know yet.
926629	926849	Nerd.
928589	929389	So what?
931389	936791	By the way, for the record, folks, the first thing that DarkSakura said to me, I want to go.
936811	938291	I do.
939891	940691	I do not want to go.
941852	944032	I haven't been on the Borg ride.
944740	948001	Bobby Blackwolf says they're shutting it down because Star Trek is irrelevant these days.
948121	948862	Bite your tongue.
949482	950963	There's that new movie coming out.
951363	952643	That's an awful thing to say.
952663	953524	You take that back.
953544	955204	You take that back, Bobby Blackwolf.
956545	956785	Alright.
957165	958465	So I'll be in Vegas.
958766	962007	Blackwolf says, I actually tried to see if I could get to Vegas this month too.
963107	964628	Because I've never seen the Star Trek experience.
964728	964888	Ha!
966809	970893	Anyhow, so two weeks and we'll fill you in more on what's going to happen that week.
970933	974696	I don't know if DarkSakura and Loki are going to do a show or if we'll pre-tape something or what we're going to do.
975517	975918	So we'll see.
976158	977459	I'll just burn things live on air.
978100	978480	Awesome.
978660	979741	The Burnination Show.
979881	981002	Yeah, that'd be great.
981042	981603	Or the Fuck Show.
981643	982664	No, you can't do the Fuck Show without me.
982684	983284	We can't do the Fuck Show.
983745	983925	Huh?
984205	985306	We can't do the Fuck Show until we're all here.
985326	986047	No, you can't do it without me.
986067	986788	You can't do it without me.
987881	990082	Alright, that's it for pretty much housekeeping.
990122	992683	Otherwise, join our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio.
992703	995645	Join our Facebook, OL Army, our live journal, Orange Lounge.
996325	997345	Where else are we, Social Horde?
997666	998486	Oh, we have a new one!
999645	1004989	If you check out the Orange Lounge Radio forums, the OL Archive has been built.
1005530	1010274	It's this, I don't know, they use SkyDrive or some website where you can share masses of big files.
1010794	1017279	And because I am a generous, nice, kind, giving person, I actually uploaded 20 old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.
1017980	1025306	Old, moldy, stanky episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, like episode 20 through 40, I think, are up there on the OL Archive.
1025646	1027648	along with some other old school Orange Lens Radio stuff.
1027888	1031471	I'm going to warn you in advance, it was a much different show five years ago.
1031871	1033032	So, be warned.
1033073	1038117	If you're expecting the same stuff you hear now, it's even worse, if you can believe it.
1038477	1039698	So there you have it, the OL Archive.
1039738	1041139	More information available in our forums.
1041500	1044202	Alright, enough whoring ourselves out, let's get to some gaming news.
1044622	1052449	Yes, this week Nintendo, along with 54 other developers, filed lawsuit against or
1053610	1056592	I don't know, a lawsuit against the makers of the R4 device.
1057073	1062477	As well as, I'm assuming they're going to try to expand it, you know, against all the devices out there.
1062497	1068122	But they're basically trying to make laws pass now to prevent people from pirating their games.
1069903	1070504	That's funny.
1071625	1071885	Yeah.
1072245	1072906	That's hilarious.
1072926	1074987	Don't you think that'll just make it worse, or what?
1075728	1077449	Well, yes.
1077749	1080852	I actually, because of the news, I went ahead and bought another one.
1081432	1081653	Just...
1082604	1083827	Just in case.
1083867	1090484	No, just, you know, because my wife wanted one for, you know, she plays puzzle games and I don't see, you know,
1092525	1099510	Well, let me read this real fast before we talk a little more about this because this is right in the same line with us talking about how you guys are running off and buying one and all this.
1100291	1108216	Actually, the word is that the R4 pricing and the sales of them are increasing a lot after this whole lawsuit happened.
1108936	1117822	Apparently, in two days' time, the price of an R4 at some stores in Japan went from just under 3,000 yen to just under 5,000 yen.
1118062	1119183	We're talking from $28 to $55 literally overnight.
1122785	1125446	The question is, is maybe that what Nintendo was trying to go for?
1126306	1128307	Driving the price of these up due to the fear?
1128767	1129127	I don't know.
1129147	1132148	That seems a little counterproductive to me because it makes the demand of them go up in a way.
1132408	1136470	I don't think that's really going to affect anything because people are just buying them really fast now.
1136510	1138410	They're just figuring, hey, we can cash in on it now.
1138890	1145252	But when the demand goes back down, they're just going to clear out their inventory somewhere and they'll still be sold somewhere.
1146553	1146833	I don't know.
1148465	1150948	Hey, I mean, at least they're taking notice of this, I guess.
1151068	1157436	In a way, though, devil's advocate, Loki, these devices can promote piracy.
1157917	1159619	So why should they be allowed on the market?
1160280	1164365	Well, because guns can kill people, so, you know...
1165993	1169977	It's not the gun killing the people, it's the people killing the people with the guns.
1170538	1177866	It's just like, these devices, sure, they can allow you to pirate games, but it's the people pirating the games that are actually pirating the games.
1177966	1180950	Chat room, I'm very, very curious to hear what you guys have to say in our chat room.
1180970	1183232	Chat.OrangeLauncher.com I want to read some of your comments.
1183432	1183512	Is...
1184674	1185534	What do you think of this?
1185654	1188797	Are these devices okay?
1189277	1190178	Or are you against these devices?
1190218	1194782	I remember we had a listener a while ago that was very, very anti-piracy that would usually chime in on these issues.
1194802	1195623	He hasn't been around in a while.
1196383	1198065	But maybe you pissed him off finally, Loki.
1198085	1198365	I don't know.
1199446	1199926	I'm curious.
1200326	1201887	There's got to be folks on both ends of the spectrum.
1202547	1205349	What do you guys in chat think about this whole deal?
1206069	1208350	DarkSakura, you say you're interested in buying one.
1208770	1210311	I'm going to ask the same question to you.
1210811	1214313	Devil's Advocate, these devices, you could say they do promote piracy.
1214353	1216193	They do allow you to play copied games on your system.
1216514	1217314	Why should they be allowed?
1218695	1222956	Well, I mean, honestly, I don't think that they necessarily should be allowed.
1223857	1224157	I mean...
1225051	1225551	www.DarkSakura.com
1247110	1255311	Well, this is what my thought would be, is that Nintendo talk to the developers and make multi-packs of old games so that...
1258212	1260092	X number of games on a cartridge for $30.
1260673	1263074	They could market something like that.
1263534	1266576	Or even have their own download service for old games like that.
1267396	1268837	Like Virtual Console?
1269017	1270157	I'm talking about for the DS.
1270497	1279882	Perhaps they're looking at the Virtual Console and perhaps expanding it to the DS and going to put out a device similar to that to do such a thing anyways.
1280282	1283023	And they're worried people are going to pirate the Virtual Console games which are $5-$10 a pop.
1284524	1285586	Thanks for watching!
1300154	1305499	or the fact that they're worried that sales are going to dip a lot like the PSP because they blame piracy on that.
1305620	1308302	I blame bad games, but you know.
1308342	1313688	But piracy kind of being able to play old Nintendo games on the PSP kind of drove sales in the beginning.
1314288	1316611	Jamie, I want to let you finish your thought before I go to chat comments.
1316631	1317211	Yes, thank you.
1317311	1317632	You're welcome.
1319073	1325336	My whole point is that I honestly do think that Nintendo might be looking to market something like that.
1325776	1328518	And it doesn't really matter because piracy is illegal.
1328598	1329699	That's the end of the story.
1330119	1339284	If you use something that is non-proprietary that is not sponsored by Nintendo to play copies of their games, it is technically theft.
1339964	1365482	so I don't think they're ever going to be okay but I think Nintendo might be looking for a way to sort of market the idea for their own benefit so I can see why they would want to push it although honestly Nintendo has had the easiest way to pirate or play imports or anything on their systems because in the past it was just a physical lockout you adjust a tab and boom you can play your imports on your Super Nintendo you know
1366761	1369442	There were absolutely no lockouts on the old Game Boys.
1370343	1374905	You can still play imports on the DS and you can buy those multi-game cartridges for dirt cheap.
1375665	1384770	So really, the whole problem I think is that Nintendo needs to look at how they're actually allowing it, is how I see it.
1385150	1392334	They've had to have built in so much because they have not been the best at preventing the piracy from going on.
1393203	1397604	Let's look at some comments from chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because it's your show too here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1397624	1399324	We'd like to hear what you guys have to say.
1400024	1401984	Blake says, it's the law of software.
1402025	1404825	Stopping piracy is impossible no matter how hard you try.
1405805	1409366	Actdeft says, disclaimer, use it for homebrew only as in programs and stuff.
1409446	1410586	Don't pirate, please.
1411026	1412806	To which I think this is kind of a good follow-up comment.
1412846	1419307	Joshi16 says, it would be like banning smoking pipes because you can put illegal drugs in it, but you can also put tobacco in them.
1419708	1421628	So it's kind of like how you choose to use it.
1422028	1422448	Interesting.
1424370	1426012	DarkTetsuya says, I agree with Loki though.
1426032	1428195	I probably wouldn't risk my DS by using one of those.
1428255	1429497	If it breaks, I'm screwed.
1430237	1431759	MissingNo says, I heart the R4.
1431819	1437206	But that's the thing though, is it won't hurt your DS at all because it's a device that runs on a cart.
1437246	1438728	You're not flashing your DS.
1438748	1440170	You're not doing anything to your DS.
1440590	1446112	Alpha Cananogram says, this is bullshit, but if they do take down these devices, they need to leave the homebrew-only flash carts alone.
1446733	1450875	TigerClaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a homebrew up to listen to internet radio on your DS.
1451515	1454916	GameGuru says, well, if Nintendo makes their own R4, that would be cool.
1455396	1456937	And I love this name, too.
1456977	1461939	The original snake, Lieutenant Plissken, says, absolutely okay.
1462039	1465261	Sure, it makes it possible, but there are lots of homebrew and other features.
1465581	1467802	People will always find a way to pirate.
1469242	1470663	I thought this comment was interesting though.
1470703	1474025	Hitstun says, I guess I still don't understand how piracy is theft.
1474386	1483912	I'm not sure if you're being facetious, but do keep in mind, you know, people get paid to make games just like people get paid to make movies and paid to write music and what have you.
1484372	1488535	And when you take it without paying for it, that's less money.
1488915	1490577	Now, granted, you get into this whole...
1491653	1492714	Thank you for watching!
1516124	1520608	PS3 films on BitTorrent while you're waiting for the European PSN network.
1539463	1548650	So, yeah, he's actually saying that we, and this is a quote, we are a PAL market and we are going to do it in PAL and we are going to do it properly.
1549290	1557616	So he said that if you want the good quality, then you can, you know, I guess just wait for it or download it like everyone else does.
1560875	1561235	Uh-huh.
1561296	1563697	It's not often you hear people acknowledging.
1564037	1564698	He's an idiot.
1565158	1571363	I have something I want to say about Sony, which is completely off-base, so before I go on tangent, does anyone want to comment on the actual story?
1572704	1572924	Okay.
1573704	1579328	I saw Casino Royale for the first time last night, which, by the way, I forgot how sexy Bond movies are.
1579448	1582470	Isn't James Bond just a sexy fucking franchise of movies?
1582490	1584112	I don't know if I watched the last movie.
1584692	1587434	But just in general, all the way back to the Sean Connery days.
1588455	1589095	DarkSakura?
1589175	1589756	If you say so.
1590456	1590736	Really?
1590916	1591457	I think they're hot.
1592097	1593078	I like certain movies.
1593118	1593719	I'll put it that way.
1594439	1595340	This is how it's relevant.
1595760	1598642	They whored Sony in that movie.
1599063	1600904	James Bond uses a VAIO.
1601204	1603306	The cell phones were from Sony.
1604246	1606908	The movie studio to put that out, I'm sure, was Sony Pictures.
1607349	1610811	I just lulled at the fact how much Sony was whored in that movie.
1610831	1611712	It was just kind of fun.
1611772	1612373	I noticed.
1612653	1614074	Usually, I don't notice those things.
1614534	1618197	And if we made a movie, we would be putting orange on stuff all over it?
1618477	1619658	Well, that's different.
1620404	1621984	We're trying to buy dinner.
1622724	1623905	These people have a lot of money.
1624265	1627085	Well, they're trying to buy a lot of dinner at the same time.
1627105	1627546	Alright, forget it.
1627586	1629166	Move on.
1629486	1639168	So, in case you had some hope out there that Final Fantasy XIII Versus was possibly coming to the Xbox 360, Square says no, it's not.
1639228	1647710	In fact, according to their video that they played during their latest fan event, I don't even know how you would pronounce this...
1649594	1652296	DKS3713 party.
1652756	1659181	Anyways, they had the video for Final Fantasy Versus which said PlayStation 3 only worldwide.
1660262	1663344	And in small print, fuck you Xbox 360 fanboys.
1663964	1664325	No, just kidding.
1664725	1666806	It was not coming out on the 360.
1667647	1676894	Although, I'd be interested to see if that's actually going to be the case when the 360 version of Final Fantasy 13 comes out and kicks ass sales-wise.
1677975	1678135	But...
1679195	1680296	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1699586	1702049	4 different Final Fantasy 13 games at the same time.
1702089	1704731	No, because they've released 7 different Final Fantasy 7 games.
1704811	1708074	Yeah, over the course of 5 years or something.
1708114	1711337	But now it's just like, hey, those all sold really well.
1711357	1714480	Let's make a lot of games all portioned apart.
1714760	1715841	And you won't be buying them?
1716522	1718724	I won't be buying every single... No, 2 of the 3.
1720546	1723829	One of which happens to be on... Well, one of them...
1724460	1725461	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1748340	1752822	Only the PlayStation 3 version and only in Japan because they're not going cross-platform over in Japan.
1753222	1767146	However, it will be out in 2009 and then they're going to start the localization and the port for the Xbox 360, which probably means we'll see it in 2010 because when they say they're going to get it in 2009, that probably means Christmas of 2009.
1767686	1768107	But we'll see.
1768567	1769947	It could be pleasantly surprised.
1770507	1770928	Who knows?
1771688	1775149	All I know, I can't wait to see what the game actually looks like.
1778137	1780038	Pingu Waku Waku Carnival
1802626	1807588	I don't really know much about these games except one of them is Snoopy and the other one has a funny name.
1808548	1812249	But there's no release date for them in anywhere but Japan and it just says Autumn.
1812730	1816351	Really, it should be called Fozzy Waka Waka Carnival.
1816691	1817351	That's Waku.
1817972	1818332	I know.
1818912	1819192	Okay.
1819852	1820933	He was making a bad joke.
1821153	1822013	That was a really bad joke.
1822884	1824204	I'm going to throw a tomato at Loki.
1825364	1828745	At least it's a lot better than, I don't know, a Snoopy game.
1829725	1831846	Peanuts are still very popular overseas.
1832526	1834486	Peanuts are still very popular in my house.
1835446	1836107	I love peanuts.
1836587	1838507	You know what will never stop being awesome?
1839227	1839487	Ever?
1840047	1841388	Snoopy snow cone machines.
1841888	1843368	Those are the greatest thing ever.
1843408	1843668	See?
1844068	1844768	I rest my case.
1846428	1848949	Loki, remember when we lived together and I bought one?
1849707	1850087	and DarkSakura.com.
1868803	1869504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1896512	1902300	DarkTetsuya says, good grief, Rob.
1903101	1906485	Well, something that's not Snoopy related, but a lot cooler.
1906886	1910451	Japanese Advent Children fans are going to be happy that
1911280	1919909	A brand new Director's Cut will be coming to Blu-ray soon, and with it will be coming the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
1921010	1924253	And with that, will also be coming a new PS3 bundle.
1924734	1930960	All this is supposed to happen March 2009, and I don't know, I'm excited.
1932522	1933343	May have to import it.
1934122	1941286	So is it just me or is it one of those things where I should have known the whole time this is why Final Fantasy VII Advent Children was kind of short.
1943407	1945227	This was just coming the whole time.
1946028	1948489	Bonus, 20 minutes deleted footage or whatever.
1949610	1950010	Sucker.
1950130	1951511	I should just tattoo it on my forehead.
1952091	1953091	I should everyone else who bought it.
1953311	1956773	I would also like to remind listeners of this show not to text me while I'm doing the show.
1957233	1957614	Thank you.
1959074	1959835	I get that too.
1961136	1964498	I don't get that because I turn my phone off.
1964938	1965759	Well, good for you.
1967360	1973243	Alright, the PSP game which Loki earlier referred to is that kind of missing Final Fantasy XIII game.
1973263	1976285	You've heard a lot about Final Fantasy XIII and Versus XIII.
1976525	1979867	Well, there's also Gaito XIII is coming out as well.
1980207	1980608	Agito.
1981508	1981848	Agito
2005623	2010454	More multi-platformism in the Square Enix world and this game soon to be on the PSP.
2010514	2014443	Well, not soon, but eventually, one day, far in the future, to be on the PSP.
2015168	2021970	Well, speaking of which, I don't know if anyone remembers that the latest Parasite Eve game was supposed to be exclusive on mobile phones.
2022511	2026352	Well, Squeenix actually said that it will be out on PSP.
2026852	2032894	And it doesn't say anything about there being a mobile phone version in development, but it's called The Third Birthday.
2033695	2041858	And they had some sort of trailer of it up that has the main character, Aya, in a wedding dress.
2042538	2042718	So...
2044335	2044655	I don't know.
2045395	2045895	Oh, with a gun.
2046876	2047676	Because you have to have a gun.
2047856	2048476	You have to have a gun.
2050696	2053317	This is a franchise people have been waiting for for a long, long time.
2053337	2054917	I think it's been eight years since the last one.
2054937	2055777	It's been a long time.
2056518	2057798	Will she be in her birthday suit?
2058178	2059398	I wish they'd translate the novel.
2060998	2061699	Yeah, that's right.
2061719	2062459	There was like a novel.
2062499	2065199	Wasn't there something else that was like a cell phone game or something?
2065219	2066780	There was also a live action movie.
2066800	2067340	There was a movie.
2067440	2069500	I've got the movie somewhere, but I haven't watched it yet.
2069540	2071981	But my friends read the novel a couple of times and says it's pretty good.
2072301	2072841	I saw the movie.
2072861	2073401	It was pretty cool.
2074522	2075502	I don't remember much of it, though.
2075522	2078884	I remember your mitochondria are full of evil.
2079364	2082165	Son of Dad in chat says Parasite Eve 2 is kind of a letdown.
2083245	2084006	Well, I didn't play it.
2087247	2087767	Let's move on.
2088408	2088688	All right.
2090568	2093249	Well, we're still waiting for Home.
2094110	2094370	Still.
2095222	2096603	Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Xevious
2124378	2127160	and there'll be three secret titles that are still on the way.
2128161	2129201	Mappy for the win.
2131023	2131383	You know what?
2131743	2138228	One good thing about this, though, and I assume you don't have to pay to play these games, is that you don't have to pay to play these games.
2138248	2139769	That's a hell of an assumption, by the way.
2140569	2140769	Yeah.
2141830	2145733	Wouldn't it be interesting if you... Because a lot of people thought this should be Xbox Live's price model.
2145753	2149015	Wouldn't it be interesting if you have to insert a quarter, quote-unquote, to play the games?
2150036	2151037	I will not be playing those games.
2151417	2151937	That's the case.
2152117	2152498	Because...
2153464	2164802	I have them on 360 DarkSakura, I'm kind of curious what you think about the Namco games being at home because I know you're an avid collector of the museum games so it kind of feels like we've had to buy them before and now they're going to be free maybe?
2165503	2167346	If they're free I'll get them, if not I don't care
2168137	2169318	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2184952	2187194	Actdeft says free is good except for Yaris.
2187214	2194000	I want to say those primetime games are probably going to be free and they're going to probably finance them with advertisements.
2215290	2216392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2229517	2231739	Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI
2251234	2252575	I didn't find it to be that hard either.
2252715	2253436	Do you remember, Loki?
2253456	2254396	It was fucking easy.
2254856	2256297	It was just like stupid easy.
2256457	2257318	Well, here's the thing.
2257378	2267544	Apparently, someone does not agree, and the name is Alex Edwards, and he is actually kind of... It's not so much a lawsuit, but what has happened is one thing has led to another.
2267804	2276950	There is now a new Illinois law that mandates that MMO providers have to make an online cancellation option available, that you have to be able to do it online.
2277390	2278330	It is online!
2278430	2281091	That's what I was thinking, but here's the deal, here's how the story goes.
2281411	2289313	This guy was playing Final Fantasy XI, he grew tired of the game, his parents were paying $13 a month, and they tried to cancel the account online.
2289753	2305256	But the claim is that Final Fantasy didn't offer them a way to do it online, didn't offer a contact phone number, so finally they went to the credit card statement to get the phone number, spent an hour and 45 minutes on hold, finally someone answered the phone, and they got it cancelled.
2305336	2305837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2318511	2347305	and then was like you know how awful play online is to uninstall and then it was like oh crap I can't delete it from the website I was supposed to do that on play online well duh that's what the instructions say and you have a manual hi well maybe in that regard does it have some merit then that you actually have to still have the game installed to be able to cancel it I mean to be honest you don't for Warcraft you can do that all on the website it's super easy I mean if you can't figure out how to cancel wow you're dumb I mean it's really really easy to cancel wow
2348966	2356692	He just pissed off that there's no big, giant button that encompasses the entire screen that says, TO CANCEL, CLICK HERE!
2357773	2360275	I mean, seriously, it was not that hard to figure out how to cancel.
2360295	2362837	It wasn't hidden in menus, it was so easy.
2363378	2368442	It was right on the Play Online screen, if you wanted to cancel it.
2368522	2375148	And obviously they had to have signed up for an account, and it's done the exact same way as you cancel it, so...
2376189	2377030	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2390904	2394546	Just because I wanted to read the summary of the actual law.
2394726	2414315	An internet gaming service provider that provides service to a consumer for a stated term that is automatically renewed for another term unless a consumer cancels the service must give a consumer who is an Illinois resident a secure method at the internet gaming service provider's website that the consumer may use to cancel the service, which method shall not require the consumer to make a telephone call or send U.S.
2414355	2417157	Postal Service mail to effectuate the cancellation, and to...
2417837	2444310	instructions that the consumer may follow to cancel the service at the internet gaming service provider's website makes it an unlawful business practice for an internet gaming service provider to violate the new provisions now is it just me though or was it a heck of a lot easier to cancel Final Fantasy XI than it was to cancel America Online maybe I'm crazy but at least they weren't begging me to stay actually if you call them and do it they try to get you to stay by giving you free months
2445137	2446398	On Final Fantasy XI even?
2446538	2446738	No.
2446938	2447779	Oh, yeah.
2447819	2449780	America Online tries to pull it all out.
2450180	2452401	I was like, my account was already free.
2453822	2454302	Retention.
2454883	2456263	Anyhow, so there you have it.
2456283	2456664	New laws.
2458285	2459045	Ridiculous.
2460006	2460366	Oh, my God.
2460426	2460986	It's so stupid.
2461326	2463227	But anyway, how about some release dates?
2464108	2467850	Like three items coming out on the 8th in Europe?
2469317	2479323	Beijing 2008, The Official Video Game of the Olympic Games, Race Driver Grid, and The Mummy Tomb of the Emperor on PlayStation 2.
2489488	2490709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2517844	2518204	B-Boy PS2, PSP
2529738	2530258	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2552813	2553734	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2569108	2572211	I believe that is the one that comes with the Xbox 360, if I'm not mistaken.
2572411	2574133	I think there was a bundle pack coming out in Japan.
2574553	2575134	Don't quote me on that.
2576175	2579498	Also, a PlayStation 3 version of NBA 2K8 is being released this week.
2580158	2581539	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii.
2581880	2584202	Survival Kids Wii.
2584522	2586083	I wonder if that's Lost in Blue.
2586444	2587304	It is Lost in Blue.
2587405	2588345	Yeah, I think it is.
2588486	2589046	Survival Kids.
2589086	2590587	Yes, it's Lost in Blue on the Wii.
2591368	2592049	So that's coming out.
2593610	2598580	and Imabikiyosu Kamihen comes out as well on the Wii this week from Sega.
2599422	2604011	And this game looks to be... What the heck?
2604051	2605013	It looks like it might be a...
2605714	2606114	DarkSakura.com
2628848	2634777	I think the brains at the OL Army headquarters need to get to work on a horror dating sim.
2635178	2636941	Not a whore, but a horror.
2638197	2642819	On the PlayStation 2, God of War 2 gets a price reduction this week in Japan, moving into the Best Price series.
2643719	2649661	Also, Grim Grimoire and Sengoku Barasa 2 Heroes also move into that same series.
2650361	2651562	Some new games coming out this week.
2651622	2664126	True Tears is coming out, as well as Aoi Koro no Kusabi Hiro no Kakera 3 comes out in Japan this week, which is looks like some type of role-playing-ish game.
2665267	2666187	You play a dude...
2667048	2669409	I don't know, it kind of looks like a dating sim.
2671089	2672650	Why would he have a sword if it's a dating sim?
2673390	2677711	Because all cool kids have swords who date.
2678032	2681873	Because if it goes bad, you know, they can commit suicide.
2682033	2682533	Just stop.
2683113	2683653	Just stop.
2684073	2691956	Hey, I just wanted to mention real quick that in a couple weeks, actually, we're going to be getting Line Rider 2, which is exciting for the DS and the Wii.
2693772	2694773	on the Nintendo DS.
2694873	2699656	Monster Farm 2 DS in Japan this week, as well as Fire Emblem.
2699996	2712765	Shin Ankoku Ryoutu Nihikari no Ken comes out this week, as well as Chou Shoutou Kadoukis 2, which is a game from Atlus, comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.
2713345	2714967	Oh, it's Trauma Center 2.
2716167	2716408	Nice.
2717548	2718849	You finally get that in Japan this week.
2719689	2733718	Coming out on the Sony PSP, just some price reductions on Quiz Mobile Suit Gundam Tonsenshi, as well as Dai Senryaku Portable 2 and Doku Makimuri Kai.
2733758	2734898	They all get price reductions this week.
2735138	2741022	But as far as new games go, Crazy Taxi Double Punch comes out on the PSP this week in Japan.
2741222	2741802	That's happy.
2742002	2743343	Get ready to make some crazy money.
2743904	2745344	That's it for your Japanese release dates.
2745364	2746205	Back to some gaming news.
2747472	2756617	Well, in other gaming news, and this actually isn't necessarily just Just Just Game, but this is for our cosplay people as well.
2757938	2770945	Gamefly is having an open casting for the next commercial, so they actually want cosplayers to send them videos saying why they love Gamefly and why the character that they're dressed up at is their favorite.
2771806	2771886	Um...
2773579	2779285	But, you know, I think it's going to be kind of iffy, but here's the details if anyone wants it.
2779766	2784231	There are live casting calls that are going to be in LA, New York, and Chicago.
2786473	2792860	That's in September, and you actually send a 45 second entry after August 26th.
2794661	2800964	As far as more information on this, the live casting calls are September 9th, Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Highland Center.
2801444	2802825	And that's 12 to 6 p.m.
2802885	2803425	PST.
2804465	2811428	September 16th in Chicago, ESPN Zone on East Ohio Street from 12 to 6 Central Time.
2812448	2819451	And September 23rd, New York at Hawaiian Tropic Zone on 7th Avenue and 49th Street at 12 to 6 p.m.
2819491	2819591	EST.
2822059	2824465	All those cosplayers are going to fit right in at Hollywood and Highland.
2826910	2831160	I actually told Ranma, the minute I read about this, I went to Twitter and I posted, Ranma!
2832179	2833960	Black Luigi needs to be in this commercial.
2834100	2834640	Make it happen.
2835000	2836021	So he said he's going to go.
2836081	2837862	So I hope if he... Cover it for us.
2837962	2838702	Yeah, cover it for us.
2838722	2843924	I want to know if it is any good or if it seems like a scam or whatever.
2844304	2845065	But I think it'll be good.
2845925	2848166	I want lots of photos from this event.
2848746	2854749	You know people are going to go just for the photo ops because that's like half the big thing about cosplay is your photo ops too.
2854809	2857370	Any excuse to be on TV, people are going to go nuts.
2858451	2860832	But you know people are going to see these commercials too and go, what?
2862714	2863154	Yeah, I know.
2863975	2865056	But there'll be other people that gets it.
2865096	2866537	Hey, cosplay opportunity, go for it.
2866757	2867257	Exactly.
2867817	2872381	Hey, cosplayers can get like actual real recognition in the real world.
2872681	2873421	I think it's a good thing.
2873842	2875062	So there you go.
2876203	2879485	Loki is going to be giving us a massive homebrew update tonight.
2879505	2879886	What is this?
2879906	2882067	There's like massive amounts of news in the homebrew world.
2882187	2883788	It's just a bunch of little small things.
2884028	2884909	So I just thought I'd mention it.
2885289	2886031	WeBrew.com
2901253	2925696	and what it does is it allows you to kind of toggle different things you want to be installed in one giant zip file and you download it and you drag and drop it to your SD memory card and if you have Twilight Princess you can use the Twilight hack to install the homebrew channel and a bunch of different homebrew programs on there and they've got a huge list of stuff and they keep adding more to it so definitely the way to go if you haven't
2926897	2930660	Don Homebrew Stuff Yet, or if you just want to make it easy to find all your programs in one spot.
2932242	2936686	Rob, I think we'll get some use out of this, but they have the Any Title Deleter.
2937086	2939608	It's a space-freeing program for the Wii.
2939908	2946694	It allows you to remove previously unremovable tiles, including the weather and news channel.
2946734	2951398	Unfortunately, though, if you have any games that have updates, they will reinstall them for you, but...
2952401	2953421	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2979093	2989984	and of course everything will be in Japanese there is some risk involved with it though you have to read the instructions very carefully because you can actually brick your console with this if it's not done right so don't do it
2992008	2992368	Just don't.
2992548	2992949	Just don't.
3011182	3039009	and you can import custom songs and all sorts of things well the new version 2.9 has come out it's still in beta but it now has online support and so they have instructions on how you can set up your PC or router I guess to be able to play online with other people so that's kind of neat though you can do online in it I don't know if you can actually do online on the Wii with Guitar Hero 3 I think you might be able to but either way it's still cool um
3039434	3040254	Thanks for watching!
3060118	3060579	and that's it
3090404	3091304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3112534	3132397	Like a 3D space shooter, it's actually now becoming a full game on the PlayStation Network That's going to be downloadable via them, you actually have to pay for it now But you'll be able to download it to your PSP and play it But it's the first time that a homebrew game like this has become downloadable on the PlayStation platform So that's kind of neat
3134085	3135125	And hopefully they'll be coming soon.
3135966	3136346	Okay.
3137146	3139487	Well, I wanted to read this comment from chat.
3139727	3142348	Going back to the cosplay Gamefly commercial thing.
3143048	3144848	SSJ100Matt, I believe, was the one that said this.
3145609	3146189	Manfei.
3146729	3148050	Could Manfei make an appearance?
3148350	3151551	Manfei would either be scary or fantastic.
3153151	3155492	That's kind of both extremes, don't you think?
3155632	3161614	I want the male Utena cosplayer to show up who looked perfectly female.
3162717	3166180	I wish I lived in New York with Ranma because I'd go and dress as Black Mage.
3167381	3168782	So maybe we could both be in it.
3168862	3169462	I'm not sure what...
3171131	3173091	Black Mage has in common with Luigi, but you never know.
3175072	3181353	I am very excited about this upcoming game, and DarkSakura, I don't know about you, but maybe you'll play this with me.
3181893	3186774	SingStar Musicals is a new rumored game to be coming out.
3187434	3196916	Supposedly, it's going to be coming out in 2009, and some songs that are rumored to be in it, Bad Guys from Bugsy Malone, Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King,
3197296	3201379	If I Were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof and Over the Rainbow from Wizard of Oz.
3201980	3204422	However, I need this song to be in it.
3206443	3207284	If at all possible.
3209606	3214530	Oh, not Springtime for Hitler?
3216151	3219554	No, you should find the one from the movie.
3219694	3219994	Okay.
3224885	3227048	Is that one from the movie?
3227068	3228069	No.
3228209	3232133	It's from... Well, no, it's just because John Barrowman sang the one in the movie.
3232153	3234055	I don't think they have the one from the movie on iTunes.
3234095	3237319	The recent movie, because... Well, I think he's wonderful.
3238612	3241093	So yeah, this is a rumored game that's going to be coming out.
3241453	3243574	That being said, I actually think this rumor is bull.
3243974	3245254	I think this rumor is a load of crap.
3245874	3246894	I don't believe that it's true.
3248295	3253816	One of the big reasons I don't think it's true is that this rumored song list has Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King.
3254737	3259418	Disney owns that, and if Disney was going to put that in a game, Disney would be making a Disney game.
3259858	3262099	Disney, I don't think, would be likely to loan this out.
3262139	3266920	One of their biggest songs, I mean, granted, I don't know, I guess Elton John wrote it, so maybe there's a way around it.
3267080	3268621	Not really a musical either.
3268742	3270343	Actually, yes, they did a Lion King musical.
3270723	3273206	I know they did, but it's Disney's musical.
3273606	3274367	It's not Sony's.
3274507	3275047	You know what I mean?
3275107	3277129	And I don't think Sony would be able to license that from Disney.
3277149	3277730	Does that make sense?
3279111	3281833	I don't know if it's necessarily Disney that owns Soul Rites.
3281953	3286517	Plus, I mean, would there really be that many people that are going to buy this?
3287018	3287858	I would.
3288499	3290281	I would too, but we're kind of weird.
3291542	3291822	So?
3294329	3294849	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3317147	3318288	I still want to import it.
3318448	3319509	This will be fun.
3319529	3326294	There's also been a big surge in West End Theater now, especially with those shows that they're doing now.
3326394	3332598	Sort of like a pop idol for musicals.
3332918	3335240	How do you solve a problem like Maria?
3335360	3337822	Hey, that was a John Barrowman show.
3337922	3338362	Yes, it was.
3338382	3339763	I'm thinking you're a fangirl.
3339943	3340503	You are ruining my song!
3340523	3342184	Oh, me sorry, me no mean to!
3342204	3346027	Well, if you wouldn't mind, please, being quiet for a minute so I can finish?
3365927	3369589	I'm glad we have this new technology.
3369609	3370550	Poor porn.
3371010	3373752	Which gives us untold opportunities.
3374773	3375473	Poor porn.
3375574	3377055	Oh, sorry.
3377435	3378496	God, it'll never get old.
3378676	3380457	Avenue Q is playing in town, Rob.
3380657	3381177	We have to go see it.
3381197	3381718	We need to go.
3381738	3382058	Seriously.
3382078	3382498	I know.
3386021	3386781	Poor porn.
3388543	3392666	We've said that as the previous cage match winner, if I do recall correctly.
3392686	3394587	I think it was a cage match winner at one point.
3395575	3395895	Love it!
3397176	3398798	And a very good question from chat.
3399198	3400719	Very, very good informed question.
3400799	3404002	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what about SingStar Rocky Horror Edition?
3404622	3405283	Yes, please.
3406023	3407725	That would be hot.
3407765	3408565	How do you do I?
3408926	3412308	See you've met my faithful handyman.
3412669	3415371	An audience participation sub-track.
3415471	3421956	Do you know how much money I would pay for Loki to sing Sweet Transvestite live on air?
3422529	3427090	DarkSakura will dig through the archive and tell you kids what you should be playing
3454833	3457074	What should the children be paying a little respect to this week?
3457415	3460016	The game of the week is Jumping Flash.
3461217	3461537	Nice.
3461797	3462818	I love Jumping Flash.
3464159	3468521	But I've mentioned this show on air many, many, many times.
3469002	3478868	When I first moved into my college dorm room, I was put in charge of my friend's boyfriend's PlayStation.
3479988	3481129	Jumping Flash, Barren Aloha, Robot,
3501406	3510071	has to use these jetpods to, you know, I guess break these jetpods and get the little islands back to Earth.
3510791	3510991	What?
3511311	3516194	Can I just say to Son of Dad in chat, this is not Jumpin' Jack Flash with Whoopi Goldberg.
3516374	3517014	No!
3517355	3517735	Stop it!
3519409	3530333	Anyway, the way that the game plays is it is very first person, and I will tell you that this totally, totally made me motion sick as hell, but it's great.
3530673	3541077	And actually, the article makes a note that it's actually just like a game called Geograph Seal, which is for the Sharp X68000, so I'll have to look for that later on.
3541917	3555181	But anyway, you play as Robert looking through Robert's eyes and you've got a screen showing you how much time you have remaining in your score and the sidekick called Kumagoro, which gives you hints and warnings and helps you out.
3555221	3565763	You've also got fireworks items as your firing mechanism, power-ups, jetpods, all this other neat stuff that goes with it.
3566143	3567964	So the big thing about those, you have to jump.
3568604	3570589	And you can make him jump three times.
3570670	3573918	You can jump off the ground twice in mid-air.
3574019	3576345	And you can get really high over the ground.
3579051	3585657	and instead of being faced horizontally, when you jump, the camera tilts down towards the ground.
3586838	3591302	So, you see why I'm talking about getting motion sick there too?
3591962	3596907	But you can also use your enemies to bounce off of in some cases.
3596967	3602131	But you get different fireworks for attacks, like cherry bombs, rockets, roman candles, and twisters.
3603292	3605093	You can get time extensions.
3605754	3609236	You can get different jetpods that are EXIT.
3609596	3613339	And so when you get them, you go to the exit pad and you can leave the level.
3613359	3616040	You also have hidden levels.
3616601	3618482	The rollercoaster level was fun, I have to say.
3620377	3627079	and you have a time attack mode so you can try to get out of the levels in a certain amount of time.
3628499	3633881	There also was a sequel that was called Jumping Flash 2 that did not do as well.
3634621	3635861	But it was still a fun game.
3636542	3642183	And apparently there were pseudo-sequels that were only released in Japan.
3642243	3647445	There was Robert Mundu on PlayStation and Pocket Mumu that was on Pocket Station.
3647465	3648145	Awesome.
3648405	3648585	What?
3648965	3650605	PocketMuMu PocketMuMu
3675706	3680307	But, um, it's actually, you can, you can get Jumping Flash at the PlayStation Store.
3681588	3686029	And, uh, coming soon, uh, the next sequel, Captain Uma Uma Nuka Nuka Apawaha.
3687710	3688130	Never mind.
3688910	3689330	Bad joke.
3691191	3692091	Oh, come on, Ferret.
3692531	3694912	I never actually played, uh, Jumping Flash.
3694932	3695332	You didn't!
3695432	3696192	No, I never did.
3696412	3699253	I have Jumping Flash in the massive old PlayStation cases.
3700444	3701145	I was in college.
3701725	3703326	Puzzle Fighter came out years after.
3719211	3726541	At any rate, if you want to play this game, then I will see about locating my copy of it and bringing it over or something.
3727363	3728304	Awesome.
3728985	3733972	It's cheeseball and it's early PlayStation, but it's a fun little game.
3735635	3739739	Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
3739839	3742041	With that, Jump and Flash, your classic game of the week.
3742341	3748607	We're going to take a quick break, but we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after some music for the live listeners.
3749047	3752950	And actually, if things get sent to me in time here, we'll do some music.
3753131	3755573	Oh yes, we're going to have some music on the podcast as well tonight.
3756233	3757815	I'll tell you a little bit more about that in just a minute.
3758115	3761218	But we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
3767810	3771452	Hey all our listeners, this is GS68 with a public service announcement.
3771912	3774653	When playing Super Smash Brothers, do not have fun.
3775153	3776594	Do not play with items on.
3777134	3779375	Items ruin the balance of the game and add randomness.
3779915	3781396	Do not pick low-tier characters.
3781736	3784137	You'll not win with them, no matter what.
3784637	3787799	The best Bowser player will always lose to the worst Fox player.
3788419	3790300	The only stage allowed is Final Destination.
3790840	3793741	If a stage has more than a flat plane on it, it's bad.
3794301	3796862	It ruins the balance of the game by giving characters advantages.
3797382	3799163	Take your F-Zero gimmicks and shove it.
3799783	3802064	Huge stages like Howard Castle are for camping morons.
3802644	3807586	Even Smashville is barely acceptable because there's a freaking moving platform on top of the main platform.
3808106	3809247	And finally, remember,
3809947	3812508	I don't care if you're at a party and just want to have fun with your friends.
3813028	3814388	Video games are not about fun.
3814748	3815669	They're about winning.
3816009	3819930	So shut the fuck up and stop having fun because video games are serious business.
3820590	3821650	Thank you and good night.
3822070	3826092	This PSA was brought to you by Mushroomy Kingdom, of the never-ending scrolling bullshit.
3827252	3828792	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
3828932	3834574	Be sure to navigate through the forums and find the OL Archive, where you can find such clips as this.
3837692	3839553	I fucking hate this game!
3839913	3841514	Goddamn you, Konami!
3841534	3842494	Goddamn you!
3866582	3869823	Ah yes, the good old days of Orange Lounge Radio.
3869863	3872524	That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter closet, wasn't it?
3872684	3873284	I think so.
3873344	3874344	I think it was one of those weekends.
3874664	3876565	Back when Karaoke Revolution was funny.
3877485	3880606	Anyhow, thanks to our listeners who provided the bumpers that break.
3880646	3883727	GS68 was the first one and PKJR92.
3884887	3887348	Did the second one, so thank you guys so much for those bumpers.
3887388	3890390	If you have a bumper you want to send, go look at the forums.
3890410	3899894	There's a whole post about us accepting things for our free break, and that would be fake PSAs, promos for non-profit shows and things like that, and so on.
3899954	3901955	So hope to get some stuff from you.
3903248	3907172	Meanwhile, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 3rd of 2008.
3908173	3915521	For more Orange Lounge Radio gaming news, gaming chat, gaming bitching, and whatever we can come up with.
3915621	3917644	Loki, how about some Xbox news?
3918174	3922316	Yeah, so there's another rumor coming out.
3922836	3923476	Yeah, another one.
3924016	3925297	I know.
3925517	3937562	This one actually has come from Ars Technica, and apparently they have their Microsoft insider who lets them know all the wonderful rumors and information and stuff like that.
3938222	3939123	They were once...
3940123	3942185	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3962523	3963964	I guess by that time they'll be all gone.
3965666	3973673	What's going to happen is the Elite's going to drop down to $399 from $449, so that's a pretty nice drop there, another $50.
3974974	3984983	The 68 system will drop down to what the Pro system is now for $299, and the Arcade system will drop from $279 to $199.
3987745	3989806	So that's pretty cool.
3989866	3995829	And apparently around that time also the hard drive is supposed to... The 120 hard drive is supposed to drop in price.
3995849	3997690	And I think probably the 60 as well.
3997810	4000031	So we'll be coming out at some point.
4001211	4012696	And the other interesting thing about that that kind of coincides with all that is there was some screenshots on VGCharts apparently from the inside of their...
4014333	4025782	Some system, I don't know what store this is from, but it's saying that the price drop is going to happen, confirmed on the arcade system on September 7th, 2008.
4027123	4034089	So that seems to give this a little more legitimacy than when this rumor usually flies around, because I was just about to ask, what makes this any different from any other price cut rumor?
4034383	4035164	XBOX 360 XBOX 360
4051404	4053165	Infinite Undiscovery, and Rock Band 2.
4053565	4055987	Well, a time exclusive for Rock Band 2.
4056387	4062311	But I say it's because the PlayStation 3 exclusives are going to be coming out around that time too.
4063012	4070297	Actually, they're going to start coming out with a lot of their big PlayStation exclusives around October.
4071037	4075920	And if they kind of get a jump on everything, especially now that they're talking about putting out a core...
4076921	4078102	and DarkSakura.com
4099702	4100644	Is Wii $1.99 or is Wii $2.50?
4100704	4104492	Oh, see, they're going to be cheaper than the Wii at this point.
4104532	4105193	That's huge.
4106316	4107398	That's really huge, I think.
4108340	4109923	Do you think Nintendo's going to have to follow suit?
4110083	4110164	No.
4111294	4112735	I guess not, Wii's are still in demand.
4131636	4131916	XBOX ZOMBIES
4158510	4159351	I love zombies.
4176551	4177611	XBOX LIVE Arcade Game
4194238	4195559	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4217216	4218657	But don't you think it would be cool?
4219398	4220959	And the answer is, yes.
4221659	4223100	Zombies are always cool.
4223261	4224622	Zombies are fantastic.
4225582	4226443	So they have a chat room.
4226463	4226923	What do you think?
4226983	4228705	Yes or no to zombies on Xbox Live?
4228805	4231667	I'm all for more of the board game type fare on Xbox Live Arcade, too.
4231707	4232627	I think those games are fun.
4234729	4236230	Well, and other fun.
4236370	4239853	And this makes me particularly happy because you know I love Valve.
4241334	4241534	Right?
4242395	4242635	Mm-hmm.
4243226	4256494	Well, you know that there's going to be a Portal Still Alive coming out on Xbox Live, but it looks like Valve is really considering bringing other titles from their services.
4256534	4257615	So I think that's pretty cool.
4258276	4263039	And that they actually don't yet have any immediate plans to try the Wii or PS3.
4263919	4267682	So, hey, they love you, Microsoft Xbox owners.
4268682	4269783	You have the love of Valve.
4270706	4276508	indeed very much but you do not have GLaDOS in this one and that is not as great
4277393	4279815	So do you think it's kind of a money milking thing?
4280015	4282936	Kind of a cheap... All business is money milking when you think about it.
4282956	4283377	Yes, it's true.
4283917	4289220	Only if you're a non-profit organization do you not look to make a profit, right?
4289380	4289600	True.
4290421	4297245	Commenting to a question Lieutenant Plissken asked in chat, says, can you put a hard drive in the no hard drive model of the 360?
4297805	4301808	Let's say you want to download Portal Still Alive and these other possible future Valve releases.
4302388	4303069	Yes, you can.
4303129	4304550	You can put a hard drive in the core model.
4304590	4305230	It's very easy.
4305610	4306771	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4329983	4333484	Good times, because I came on here and I bitched, whined, and moaned on the show so bad.
4333524	4334304	I was so pissed.
4335004	4336324	But all's better now in Rob's world.
4337264	4342045	Especially after the yumminess of Soul Calibur 4 and Geometry Wars 2 this week.
4346046	4348406	You know, I'm going to have to get that Geometry Wars, I think.
4349206	4350106	At least get the demo.
4350126	4355027	The demo, from what I hear, is almost the full deadline mode, which is get as many points as you can in three minutes.
4355367	4357368	And it's a really good way to test if you're going to like the game or not.
4358188	4359168	So, at least get the demo.
4362853	4364014	So, let's move on.
4364355	4365236	Okay, shit.
4365856	4367318	Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you over there.
4367638	4371162	Well, you guys were still talking about freaking Geometry Wars.
4371602	4372103	I was waiting.
4372683	4373464	Anyways, so...
4375148	4386176	You may remember that the Bourne Supremacy just came out beginning of June and that was part of the whole Vividi license and stuff, actually Sierra Entertainment.
4386656	4403669	Well now that they've been purchased by Activision and Blizzard have merged together, they're starting to, or Activision and Vividi and Blizzard and all those companies have merged together, they're starting to kind of go through what franchises they own and kind of slim it down a bit.
4404230	4408397	and one of those franchises, of course, is The Bourne Supremacy.
4411235	4412656	or Born Conspiracy, I'm sorry.
4413938	4415959	And actually the whole Born lineup.
4416019	4418582	In fact, there's some other stuff about that as well.
4418942	4429472	But they're actually giving back the Born Conspiracy to Lundrum Entertainment because Robert Lundrum, of course, was the guy that wrote the Born books.
4430072	4431473	So it's kind of going back to them.
4431554	4434476	And I guess, I don't know if they want to put any other games out.
4434716	4436118	They have to find a new publisher, I guess.
4437058	4437459	Interesting.
4439321	4442842	Well, you know, it didn't just stop there with the Bourne series.
4443922	4447443	Activision, Blizzard, they're kind of looking at some of the other franchises as well.
4447843	4453884	And some of the franchises that were rumored this week, Brutal Legend, Ghostbusters, the video game, were supposed to be lost.
4454224	4455924	It actually came out a little later in the week.
4455964	4456825	That is not true.
4456905	4461666	Ghostbusters, absolutely not canceled, according to Vivendi Sierra.
4461846	4462606	Not canceled.
4462626	4463406	That is still happening.
4464286	4468227	The spokesperson for Sierra had actually said, quote, First and foremost, the game is not canceled.
4468827	4471128	However, the game may not have a publisher right now.
4471588	4473909	That was a little more in the blue there.
4474809	4477710	Also, Brutal Legend is fine.
4478970	4482171	So that series is still supposed to be on the way.
4482251	4487953	Well, it's really weird, though, that they would keep Spyro, Crash, and all that stuff and get rid of, I don't know, the good games.
4487973	4489133	Spyro's kind of a money machine.
4490113	4490794	Yeah, and they kept 50 Cent.
4492014	4493835	Blood in the Sand, or whatever that thing is.
4494175	4495456	That game sounds very interesting.
4496236	4499238	Chronicles of Riddick, apparently, was booted to the curb, too.
4499258	4502019	Yeah, but that, I think, was a long ways away anyway.
4502780	4505361	Well, I just hope they didn't get rid of the Island of Dr. Brain.
4505381	4505841	Am I right?
4507342	4507662	What?
4508143	4510784	Because the Island of Dr. Brain was an awesome Sierra game.
4510804	4512365	If you say so.
4513567	4519290	I wonder, you remember, it was probably like a year ago, we had those kids that were making The Silver Lining, remember that?
4519330	4541342	The unofficial King's Quest sequel The Silver Lining, and then they went through that whole song and dance where they had to lose the King's Quest ties, and now the game is just being released as The Silver Lining I wonder if all this recent, you know, mergey merge news means maybe they can get away with doing it as a King's Quest game again I doubt it, but it's still nice to imagine I suppose, if you want to keep dreaming Yeah, I know
4542352	4542812	The Hay.
4543252	4546294	If we didn't have Dreamers, we also wouldn't have Bums.
4546454	4547775	So, kidding.
4548835	4550716	Lieutenant Plissken makes a very excellent point in chat.
4550736	4551777	Chat.orange.com.
4552377	4554058	50 cent greater than Chronicles of Riddick?
4554218	4555458	Question mark, exclamation point.
4555658	4556379	Both great.
4557839	4558860	Question mark, question mark.
4559620	4560281	You know what we need?
4560321	4568464	Speaking of movie franchises from 10 years ago, when I went to see The Dark Knight the other day, they were showing on the screen a preview for Starship Troopers 3.
4570186	4571888	Why did we never get a video game for that?
4591451	4619699	well you know I'm not sure if everyone's familiar but there were screen captures and video out for Soul Calibur 4 that was showing Darth Vader and Yoda in the same game which as we knew Yoda was in the Xbox 360 edition and Darth Vader was in the PS3 one and the director of the game Katsuto Shisasaki said that they don't have any plans for making either one downloadable content for either console
4620580	4631280	um but then again apparently those screen captures and uh and the video that was out are supposed to be legitimate you know actual same versions of the game so
4633146	4639333	Maybe, I mean, maybe that was just like a... I would assume that in programming both characters would have been included, right?
4639493	4642877	So it might just be from the developer's kit or something.
4644458	4650445	You know, it could be either from the developer's kit or there's a rumor floating around and you really would have to read in between the lines.
4650765	4652968	This guy's saying it's not going to be download content, right?
4653588	4665216	Some of the rumors that are going around say that if you buy The Force Unleashed, the game that The Apprentice or Starkiller is actually starring in, it unlocks the other Star Wars character on your respective system.
4665476	4666157	That's smart.
4666957	4668378	It's an interesting way of doing it.
4668518	4672160	It's a way of saying, hey, buy this game and please don't think that it sucks.
4672501	4675943	No, it's not download content.
4676623	4680086	It's the biggest version of Pay to Unlock ever.
4680766	4686670	Well, the question is then, if that's the case, then I wonder if it's a save file or something like that.
4687651	4688131	Who knows?
4688251	4692054	But the other thing to consider, there's a trailer for the Force Unleashed in the game.
4692735	4697378	And I'm sure that's part of how they were able to negotiate Starkiller and Yoda being in the game.
4697698	4698579	But just very interesting.
4698619	4700981	It kind of makes you think, ah, maybe this is it.
4701081	4702462	I see what you did there.
4702562	4706545	I would bet 10 to 1 that's going to be the way you unlock it, is that you have to get Force Unleashed.
4707205	4709126	Which means they'll be impossible to find on Gamefly.
4709567	4717312	And I wonder if having the fact that you have Soul Calibur IV, if that unlocks something for you on the Force Unleashed.
4717832	4718413	Perhaps.
4718753	4723616	Maybe an alternate costume for Starkiller, since he does have two in Soul Calibur.
4723716	4724077	Who knows?
4725117	4726598	It might be a little silly, but you never know.
4726919	4728440	The unlocks aren't always that great.
4729431	4730272	They should just chain them.
4730292	4735037	They'll have something else and then you'll unlock... Just time release Vader.
4735437	4737800	You know, like three months from now, just time release him.
4738180	4739462	Do a patch that unlocks him.
4739762	4741604	It's obvious something's going to go there.
4741644	4744187	There's one square in the game that is not filled in.
4744647	4746769	And if you look on the PlayStation... That goes for nobody.
4746789	4747570	It's very obvious.
4748091	4748812	That's like, you know...
4750146	4751467	One for me and one for my homies.
4751487	4757929	They looped like six characters in one screen, the star screen, not to be confused with Starkiller.
4758109	4765111	They had famous anime creators make Soul Calibur characters, but they're just all filed under the star icon in the select menu.
4765151	4766612	And some of them are pretty cool, actually.
4766912	4768733	But anyhow, sorry, getting off topic.
4769173	4769413	Yeah.
4770773	4771554	That's interesting, though.
4772194	4772534	Good theory.
4773752	4774973	Star Wars, The Shit Game
4803984	4818032	Really strange stuff in there, from a level with crashing planes to a giant foot like Monty Python, floating eyeballs, fire, all sorts of crazy stuff.
4818673	4826457	Basically, the game is very short, but it challenges you to try to beat it, losing the least amount of lives and getting through it quickly.
4826857	4830219	There are a lot of quick ways you can glitch through the game.
4831500	4834142	Monty Python's Flying Circus I knew this was coming
4860470	4864914	Oh, and the best part about the game, I forgot to mention, is that all the music in it is MIDI.
4865394	4869237	And it's all like, you know, like pop music MIDI.
4871139	4878365	Like they have Spice Girls in there, and it's all randomly selected to, like Lanny Kravitz and Spice Girls and stuff.
4879365	4884650	I think that from here on out, all the rest of Loki's story should be done to Monty Python's Flying Circus opening.
4885310	4886571	Okay, we can arrange that.
4887912	4888333	Okay.
4889554	4889934	Okay.
4893069	4893950	We'll see how that works.
4893970	4894250	We'll try.
4894510	4895671	Now, here's the thing, though.
4895791	4897012	Wouldn't this be Shit Game 2?
4897993	4899254	Because I've played Ping Pals.
4901076	4903538	Well, it's Shit Game 3, because I've also played Yaris.
4903558	4904099	Oh, I see.
4905240	4907121	But see, that's the thing, is this game's actually better.
4907882	4911065	But seriously, though, the character looks like he's made from MS Paint, and I think he was.
4912606	4914748	He looked... Oh, it was hilarious.
4914788	4915889	I watched the video of it.
4916369	4917910	I did download the game before the show.
4918311	4920713	Haven't played it yet, but I'm gonna give it a try.
4921035	4921556	The FUs of the Week
4956007	4963088	My FU of the week, um, it first of all goes towards my cat and her passengers.
4964108	4966209	I have had to bathe the cat today.
4967389	4970810	She has bad fleas, and they did not all wash off.
4971650	4978331	So I have to get a hold of Heather, you know, I have to get a hold of Heather and get some front lines for my kitty cat.
4978531	4980291	Well, I know Heather, but the listeners don't know Heather.
4980491	4981452	Heather is awesome!
4981772	4982772	Okay, that's all you need to know.
4982792	4983552	That's all you need to know.
4985683	4987284	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5016075	5017435	Loki, your FU's of the week
5040640	5048747	with their cell phones and just driving fucking slow and just really annoying in fact this woman actually she drove through the parking lot really slow
5050008	5056070	Oh, my other favorite thing is when there's a slight dip in the road or something like that and people slow the fuck down.
5056230	5062992	When they're in an SUV, an off-roading vehicle, and they slow the fuck down because it's a little dip in the road.
5063832	5065773	Oh my god, that's also annoying.
5065833	5070514	Just a point though, somebody talking on the cell phone in their parking lot wouldn't technically be illegal.
5070794	5071715	They're still driving.
5072295	5075536	I know, but technically they can't pull you over in the parking lot.
5076274	5078216	Well, she's still driving around, so that still counts.
5078457	5079317	Just a technicality.
5079337	5079798	I'm just saying.
5080319	5081600	And I followed her there, so.
5082021	5087587	But she's a dumb bitch, and I actually thought about knocking on her window and going, get off the fucking phone, ass.
5089189	5090250	But no, I had better things to do.
5090779	5091359	FU to Clothes Shopping
5107146	5128440	but I went to Mervin's this week because I heard they were filing chapter 11 bankruptcy and I want to make sure I get all the good sales before the chain goes under and also thanks to me being sick earlier this year and the diet that has resulted I've lost another waist size so I had to buy all new jeans and that's expensive clothes are expensive so F you to expensive clothes
5130000	5132962	But a non-FU to Mervin's and a non-FU to Mervin's sales.
5133923	5135264	Because those are both awesome.
5136304	5137785	Still need to go to the outlets though this week.
5138326	5139687	Because the outlets are the best thing ever.
5140700	5142281	All right, let's get back into some gaming news.
5165675	5171599	So if you think about it, you could go all the way back to the Wii NES Retro port.
5171879	5184227	This is a device that was released that allows you to, yes, plug in your old school NES controller and play Mega Man 9 the way it might have been meant to be played with the old school NES controller.
5185168	5185969	What do you guys think?
5186129	5189391	Is this worth going through the hassle just to play with the old school NES controller?
5189631	5189771	Maybe.
5190332	5190712	Forget it.
5190752	5191392	Just use the Wiimote.
5191432	5192293	I think that sounds like fun.
5192713	5195315	It does sound like a challenge.
5196015	5197196	And who doesn't love a challenge?
5197516	5202880	It sounds like another excuse for G4 to bring out their giant NES controller to do something stupid on TV.
5202900	5203560	Yippee!
5205322	5205722	Can't wait.
5206022	5211946	Out of curiosity, would this sway you to buy this on the Wii, or are you still like, eh, not good enough, I'm still going to get it on 360?
5212186	5212627	That's right.
5214048	5214948	That's kind of where I'm at.
5215008	5220292	I'm like, oh, that's cute, cute, but I may still get it on the Wii.
5223735	5225756	I'm still on my silly boycott.
5225856	5226537	I have no room.
5227117	5227938	And that's where I stand.
5228238	5229559	Don't worry, Rob.
5229819	5230820	We won't have to purchase it.
5232941	5234522	I will get it on the 360, I'm sure.
5234562	5237564	But I like the prospect of being able to use the old controller.
5237584	5238925	Why don't they put it on the DS?
5239005	5243108	They need to put another Mega Man collection on the DS and release this along with it.
5243408	5247111	Do you think Capcom might release a remake of the game later on?
5247191	5248492	I mean, they've never done that before.
5248992	5250034	Never ever, right?
5250414	5253558	Do you think there might be a Mega Man 9 Championship Turbo Edition next year?
5254099	5254579	I doubt it.
5256161	5256702	You never know.
5256862	5257283	You never know.
5258874	5261695	Well, moving forward, and forward is a good way to move.
5262495	5266276	Konami wants to hop on the old school bandwagon.
5267137	5269217	Because, well, everyone else is doing it, why can't they?
5270738	5273819	Well, then again, they were already doing the Castlevania one, right?
5274099	5274519	Rumored.
5274619	5276340	But, yeah, well, here's more rumor.
5277160	5280621	It was actually an EGM put up by WeFanboy.
5281441	5282241	Said that...
5284082	5295354	In the September 2008 issue, there will be one of the most beloved yet overlooked action-adventure franchises of yore will soon get a surprise retro-revival sequel.
5298698	5299058	Hmm.
5299719	5301301	It better not be Bomberman.
5301321	5304444	I do love Bomberman, but we've already had Bomberman.
5304524	5305045	Going on!
5306739	5312201	It'll be... What if it was Turtles Tournament Fighter?
5313101	5313782	That would be awesome.
5313822	5315963	They lost the Turtles license to EA.
5316083	5316543	That's right.
5316663	5317003	Damn.
5317443	5320584	Or it could be... No, they lost it to Ubisoft.
5321265	5326266	Or it could be... Lucky O'Hare!
5326506	5328427	Gradius, since they already said they were going to do Gradius.
5328447	5329488	We did talk about Gradius a couple weeks ago.
5329848	5330188	Yeah.
5330468	5330828	Who knows?
5332749	5333729	How about a bunch of stuff?
5334349	5335670	How about Blades of Steel?
5338749	5339550	Actdeft suggests double dribble.
5361889	5362770	How about Skate or Die?
5362790	5363611	Was that a Konami game?
5363711	5364212	I don't think it was.
5364472	5366635	No, it was Ultra Games.
5368017	5369579	So that was Skate or Die.
5369980	5370260	Maybe.
5371482	5371842	We'll see.
5372623	5373925	I don't think they would do that game.
5374943	5375783	Earthworm Jim Earthworm Jim
5401517	5403179	Remember the opening to Earthworm Jim?
5403219	5403600	I love that.
5405021	5405742	Some other things.
5406323	5408585	Ys Book 1 and 2 will be coming out.
5409486	5411388	And Samurai Showdown 2.
5412489	5413751	Yes, that was the best one.
5415352	5416654	Wasn't Ys a CD game?
5418029	5418610	Or am I wrong?
5418870	5423598	I would like to say that the East Book 1 and 2 came out on CD.
5424219	5428646	So the two games were released as a single CD.
5429026	5430609	Have we gotten CD games here yet?
5430789	5431210	Yes.
5431450	5431771	We have?
5432051	5432132	Oh.
5432699	5434199	They got Dracula X in Japan, didn't they?
5434599	5435800	Yeah, I knew they were coming.
5435960	5437080	I just didn't know we had any yet.
5437680	5438280	That's awesome.
5438940	5441441	But no, the Ys games are good now.
5441461	5444241	Yeah, I might actually... I don't have room for Ys.
5445882	5446422	You know what, Rob?
5446502	5447082	I'll tell you what.
5447302	5448082	Just come over to my house.
5448102	5449402	We'll hook up the PC engine.
5449622	5449903	Deal!
5452763	5454103	Anything else, Loki, coming out?
5454804	5455144	That's it.
5455624	5455864	Alright.
5456324	5457064	I thought there might be more.
5458052	5458632	StarCraft 2 and Diablo 3
5487561	5490405	Yep, they're going to have achievements as well.
5491206	5498396	Every achievement earned is going to go towards this Blizzard level that every Blizzard user is going to use.
5498776	5504564	You could basically think of it like an Xbox Live type thing where you have a gamer score but now you're going to have a Blizzard level.
5505064	5506865	Achievement Horror Loki, are you excited?
5535422	5537463	But you don't really play Blizzard games on the computer, do you?
5537723	5538923	No, well, I used to.
5538943	5541884	I used to play, like, what was it?
5541924	5543025	I used to play StarCraft.
5543345	5545065	Or not StarCraft, World of Warcraft.
5545546	5546626	Not World of Warcraft.
5546646	5547146	Warcraft!
5547286	5549047	The original Warcraft and Diablo.
5549967	5551027	Never played Diablo 2, though.
5551327	5551627	Should have.
5552508	5553088	It's interesting.
5554677	5556218	I was just looking at a chat room here.
5557139	5560782	Pooface says, too bad the life of a Blizzard game lasts the same of a game console.
5561242	5561562	I don't know.
5561642	5563524	It seems like Blizzard games last a long time.
5563544	5567266	There's still people that freaking play Diablo 2 like it just came out yesterday.
5568627	5571009	Lieutenant Plissken says, achievements are all the rage these days.
5571409	5571970	Yeah, kind of.
5571990	5575953	You see trophies now and pretty soon I'm sure Nintendo will have something as well.
5576033	5576353	Who knows?
5577174	5577274	So...
5578843	5584528	Well, something else that is pretty, this makes me very, very, very happy.
5586630	5593236	There is a rumor now that Sega is going to be bringing back the Jet Set Radio games.
5594717	5600582	As we know, there was a Dreamcast one, which we actually got as Jet Grind Radio, and then Xbox had Jet Set Radio Future.
5601892	5603734	Jet Set Radio Game Boy Advance
5620268	5622569	What if we had it on the iPhone?
5646397	5646878	Too tiny.
5647118	5647538	Too tiny.
5647658	5653861	They've been quoted as saying, well, the president of Sega is quoted as saying that the iPhone is the new Dreamcast.
5655621	5656202	Interesting.
5657042	5659943	Could you imagine doing your graffiti with your finger?
5659963	5661104	That'd be kind of weird to me.
5661144	5661864	I don't know.
5662465	5663765	Yeah, maybe for a little while.
5664566	5665006	But I don't know.
5667007	5668147	I do hope the rumor is true, though.
5668827	5671669	I don't know if I'd be calling the iPhone the new Dreamcast.
5671749	5672029	That's...
5673863	5675045	Not a good thing to compare it to.
5675526	5676769	Well, do you have some more news for us, Loki?
5677410	5678933	Yeah.
5685441	5691686	with all these different systems coming out with their own achievement and trophy and whatever systems.
5692567	5696230	There's actually going to be a new site to track all these at the same time.
5696290	5704917	It's actually being created by Rooster Teeth, who you may remember from the Red vs. Blue series, among all their other animated Makima series.
5705317	5709621	But now they have a brand new website that's going to database all these.
5710382	5711663	And that site is...
5714605	5715266	What's it called?
5715306	5715986	Small Rewards.
5716126	5717167	Achievement Hunter, I'm sorry.
5717527	5718228	That's what it's called.
5718969	5731558	And right now I know that they were saying that they're going to do the 360, the PS3, and of course the iPhone, and maybe of course they're going to add on these Blizzard ones as well.
5731939	5732699	So that's pretty cool.
5733840	5735822	They'll have to track all these different sites.
5735842	5738844	I wonder if they're going to have some sort of way to add them all together or something like that.
5742607	5743608	Is that really necessary?
5744912	5745573	Yes, it's very necessary.
5745593	5746693	Actually, it is kind of funny.
5746733	5747174	I don't know why.
5747194	5747354	It is.
5747374	5748175	I think it's hilarious.
5748395	5750877	DarkTetsuya says, I'm liking the theme music for stories.
5753659	5755660	You know, I once listened to a gaming podcast.
5755680	5766629	I don't remember who it was, but they actually play music in the background the entire show, which is cool because I think they play mostly indie bands and stuff, and it makes their show unique, so more power to them.
5766689	5768150	But just kind of funny.
5768190	5770011	I never thought of doing theme music for stories.
5770492	5771392	I think it would be cool.
5772449	5778076	If we could actually, when we're talking about a certain game, have the music from the game playing in the background.
5778096	5779678	But that takes a lot of coordinated effort.
5779698	5780579	You guys don't even know.
5782101	5783382	I would do it if we could.
5784544	5787948	But in the meantime, you get Monty Python's Flying Circus.
5789869	5791770	I don't know what theme music would be appropriate for this.
5791910	5796130	Maybe something about moving on or something.
5797031	5798251	Wasn't that a DDR song, Moving On?
5798951	5801232	Penny Arcade Expo is going to the East Coast in 2010.
5801552	5803032	That is the current rumor going around.
5803072	5804012	Actually, it's not really a rumor.
5804332	5809033	Tycho himself has said that Penny Arcade Expo is going to be going to the East Coast.
5809493	5812754	And that doesn't mean that the West Coast show is going to go anywhere.
5813114	5817635	They're turning PAX into multiple places at multiple times type events.
5818315	5824836	Apparently, it's quoted by the Penny Arcade team has been quoted from saying, frankly, it should be global.
5825557	5827977	An East Coast show is only the beginning.
5828577	5833438	So one thing they might announce at Penny Arcade Expo this year is that there's going to be probably an East Coast show next year.
5833778	5834278	And who knows?
5834378	5835539	Maybe something in Europe?
5836479	5836919	Canada?
5837799	5838159	Who knows?
5839659	5841100	Somewhere maybe outside the U.S.
5842140	5842620	Hawaii?
5842980	5843500	Australia?
5844800	5846741	Penny Arcade Expo Luxembourg.
5846921	5847141	Yes.
5848448	5849589	Penny Arcade, Mozambique.
5849909	5850569	Wouldn't that be fun?
5851350	5851830	Monaco.
5853591	5856013	To Las Vegas or Monaco.
5856693	5857894	Win a fortune in a game.
5858394	5859635	My life would never be the same.
5859695	5860035	Rob.
5860396	5860676	Ah, yes.
5862357	5863437	Let's get this part over with.
5863898	5865659	Yes, it's the mailbag, kids.
5867760	5869221	Every week you email us.
5869301	5870742	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
5870762	5871683	Let's open up the mailbag.
5872383	5873564	See what you guys have to say this week.
5875125	5877006	Oh, did we ever get some doozies.
5878345	5879286	I got to say doozy.
5879946	5882649	Well, first of all, this comes from Dave.
5883569	5884350	Hi, Dave!
5884570	5885211	Hi, Dave.
5885731	5886592	You can't do that.
5887773	5888033	Sorry.
5888814	5891035	Hey, OLR crew, great work on the show.
5891156	5898281	I was wondering if any of you have checked out GiantBomb.com, the new website from former game spotter Jeff Gertzman and company.
5899642	5902184	It's basically a potentially awesome game focused wiki.
5902824	5904525	What do you think of it if you've tried it?
5904646	5912130	I'm sure there are tons of randomly awesome games on Sega systems in its desperate need of DarkSakura's careful attention.
5912671	5915352	Love the show and other nice closing pleasantries.
5915672	5916953	Forgive the shit punctuation.
5917133	5918074	Oh, you're forgiven.
5918494	5919595	Dave from ye old England.
5921363	5921844	You're forgiven.
5935675	5937676	It's sleek, but here's the thing.
5937716	5940217	If I want GameWiki, I usually go to Wikipedia.
5940897	5948920	I'm not exactly sure what is going to make me visit this site on a daily basis, which is what it's all about, right?
5948940	5950021	That's just some friendly feedback.
5950041	5953422	I'm not trying to knock the site or anything because it's rather slick.
5953462	5954362	It's put together rather well.
5955763	5965602	and I think they'll get a lot of listeners and certainly they have some knowledgeable people from the gaming industry working for it but I'm not sure there's anything there just yet that's going to make me want to click reload every six hours you know what I mean?
5967481	5968702	Next, our weekly letter from Cheeseburger.
5997469	5999270	You know you don't have to read every single email.
5999730	6000171	Yes, I do.
6000771	6001412	No, mostly.
6002112	6008916	Hey guys, today I got a subscription to Xbox Live with a headset, camera, and some other stuff, including two arcade games.
6009317	6012919	I only have Halo 3 and no arcade games, so what arcade games do you think I should get?
6013519	6017122	I don't like sports and have things like Pac-Man be jeweled in Zuma on my iPod.
6018643	6025087	Well, if you're listening to Part A, I would tell you to go right now and get Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 because I think it's probably the best game on Xbox Live Arcade right now.
6025927	6026908	There's Symphony of the Night.
6027594	6029855	which is also a great game if you don't have a PS1.
6032076	6032976	Also, good games.
6033356	6036618	If you like music games, which a lot of our audience does, I don't know where you stand on that.
6037518	6043060	Not Uno, but Every Extent Extra Extreme, maybe Luminous as well, would both be good things to look into.
6043501	6045221	Boom Boom Rocket, if you like music games.
6047222	6053725	If you're not so much on music games, if you like role-playing games, the Penny Arcade game is actually pretty low-worthy, although it is a little more pricier.
6054825	6058646	But stay away from some of those retro classic change games.
6058787	6062068	I do like the Pac-Man, though, Tournament Edition.
6062808	6063628	Oh, God, yes.
6063708	6064429	Thank you, chat.
6064549	6066389	Run, do not walk, Res HD.
6066690	6067030	Yeah!
6067150	6069911	Which could also very well be the best game on Xbox Live Arcade.
6070691	6072412	It is a virtual tie with Geometry Wars 2.
6074129	6075050	They are both great.
6075110	6076131	So run, do not walk.
6076231	6077332	Rez and Geometry Wars.
6077732	6079513	Pac-Man Championship Edition, honestly.
6080094	6084657	Whether you have the original on your iPhone or not, the Actdeft, I completely agree with what Actdeft is saying in chat.
6084918	6086499	It doesn't matter if you already have the original version.
6086839	6087620	It's different enough.
6087640	6090642	The only thing better than that, though, was the GameCube Pac-Man Versus.
6091283	6093584	But you don't get that on Xbox Live, so make do.
6093865	6097027	So next up, hello Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.
6097147	6098048	Hello, emailer.
6099346	6102370	First things first, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy listening to your show.
6102711	6106115	Not all gaming podcasts are created equal, and yours is a testament to that.
6106495	6106796	Thank you.
6118130	6132680	DarkSakura correctly pointed out that they are a business and their primary concern is making money, but I fear that their current hard-on for casual gamer is going to come back and bite them in the ass.
6134187	6137709	The casual market is supporting them, but it will not sustain them.
6138069	6140951	The Wii has the lowest attack rate of all the current-gen consoles.
6141311	6145834	The fact remains that it is still the hardcore gamers who are the lifeblood of the gaming companies.
6146234	6157320	Nintendo has the most loyal fanbase of any of the big three, but if these hardcore fans are made to feel more and more alienated, not all of the Mario and Zelda sequels in the world will keep them from defecting to another camp.
6157640	6162221	that can offer them more, and by more I mean hassle-free online and disk-based storage.
6162661	6172403	As someone who grew up with an NES controller in my hands, it disappoints me to see Nintendo apparently dropping me for kindergartners and soccer moms, and I now know I am not alone in this.
6172463	6173743	Loki will back me up, I'm sure.
6174383	6177124	Keep on rocking like the proverbial hurricane, raw fish and beer.
6177484	6180985	This email is brought to you by Mixed Metaphors, home of the ass-biting hard-ons.
6182625	6183105	Really?
6184425	6187226	That's the best home of thing ever.
6188050	6189311	The beat goes on when Nintendo.
6189872	6190412	Beat goes on.
6191273	6191853	Next up.
6192354	6193235	Hey, OLR.
6193255	6193855	Hi.
6194576	6201422	I know Rob is a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and I wanted to know what his reaction was to the news of MTV creating a remake of the classic film.
6202062	6205485	If he didn't know yet, I'm sorry to be the bearer of what I see as terrible news.
6205705	6210329	Harry.
6211670	6212451	Yeah, it's...
6216265	6222569	I don't like to judge things until I see them or watch them or play them or whatever, but in this case, you just kind of know.
6224591	6226152	Remember the old Animaniacs segment?
6226432	6227873	Good idea, bad idea?
6229274	6231835	Bad idea, this right here.
6232556	6234137	This is my thought, though.
6235318	6237499	Okay, we saw the redone play, right?
6238280	6238460	Yes.
6238945	6239785	And that was good.
6240766	6250991	What if they had it carry, I guess, the updated music of the new play, but keep the feel of the old one?
6252312	6253892	Again, I don't want to judge it until I've seen it.
6254192	6257654	A casting choice is very important, a lot of it that goes into it.
6257694	6262557	And I don't want to say that everything MTV touches necessarily turns to shit, because, you know, rock band's cool.
6262877	6265118	But then again, this is the network that brought us The Hills.
6266590	6268232	I mean shit, enough said, right?
6270315	6272498	This is the network that started reality TV.
6273339	6277805	I think this is kind of unnecessary, but it's also inevitable at the same time.
6278325	6279607	If it ain't broke, don't
6281043	6288607	I liked the idea better five years ago when the rumor was that the guy who did Priscilla Queen of the Desert was going to be remaking it with Alan Cumming playing Frank and Furter.
6288627	6289928	Oh my god, wouldn't that be great?
6290008	6291649	See, I was totally fine with that.
6292849	6295951	That would just be... Now we're five years later and the rumor's a little less cool.
6296731	6297432	So, we'll see.
6298973	6302595	SSJ100Matt says, OLR needs a Wheel of Morality segment.
6302835	6303575	We do!
6303595	6306216	Wheel of Morality, turn, turn, turn.
6306276	6308057	Show us the lesson that we should learn.
6308818	6309078	Love it.
6310432	6321025	Email, YoOLR, this be the GS68 Enough of the speaking in ghetto speak.
6321105	6326932	In response to Actdeft's call last week, how people who play rock bands should learn real instruments, I'd like to say that
6329895	6337957	People who play Wangan or Initial D should invest shitloads of money in a real car and then illegally street race down Highway 101 at 200 miles an hour.
6338697	6341558	People who play Pokemon should capture real animals and train them.
6341658	6342298	Hi, PETA.
6342558	6343039	Well, that's okay.
6343159	6344839	PETA's a bunch of psycho assholes anyway.
6345519	6349420	People who play GTA should learn to hijack cars and kill people in real life.
6349940	6352081	Hi, he who shall not be named.
6353479	6357985	People who play Mulana should explore real life ruins and get killed in the process.
6358906	6361730	People who play Shoot Em Up should invest in a real space fighter jet.
6361850	6363272	Oh wait, those don't exist.
6363953	6365595	That is all, GS68.
6365936	6366296	P.S.
6366336	6369521	This email is brought to you by Tekken, home of the never-ending stages.
6372588	6375429	DJ Ratchet makes a good point going back to the hills.
6375530	6376930	The hills makes the soup funny.
6377290	6377831	That is true.
6377871	6379992	Without MTV, the soup would not be nearly as funny.
6381993	6382833	Oh, yes, to that other email.
6382853	6383293	There's more email.
6383534	6385335	Okay, more email.
6385415	6387576	Actually, Rob with 2B sent us a couple of stories.
6387736	6388016	Yay.
6388636	6390257	And this one I think is hilarious.
6390357	6394619	It's the top seven irritating female characters in video games.
6396640	6401743	So if the stupid ad would ever disappear because I fucking hate ads.
6405489	6405769	You know what?
6405789	6409091	I'm about to just say screw this because I hate ads.
6410793	6411213	Stop.
6411794	6412874	Someone's got to pay the bills.
6413855	6417178	Number seven is Ashley Williams from Mass Effect.
6421721	6422362	I don't know.
6422622	6423442	I didn't play Mass Effect.
6423823	6424924	Six is Minnie Mouse.
6427626	6430448	I guess I'm talking about... Mickey Mousecapade was awesome.
6430488	6431549	Yeah, Mickey Mousecapade.
6432029	6433030	Screw whoever wrote that.
6433729	6435510	Ashley Graham from Resident Evil 4.
6440232	6440912	Moving forward.
6443954	6445134	God, the internet sucks.
6446515	6446835	Sorry.
6447215	6451517	Four is Mikiko Ebihara from Daikatana.
6455759	6458720	And then... Stupid webpage.
6461841	6462802	Next up is...
6467429	6471592	It looks like... Catalina from Grand Theft Auto 3.
6473834	6476055	And then the Beggar Lady in Assassin's Creed.
6477857	6480198	And then our last ones on the list.
6480799	6484802	Number one is Navi from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
6486163	6487204	Hey, listen!
6487404	6488585	Hey, listen!
6488665	6489605	Hey, listen!
6489906	6490766	Hey, listen!
6492447	6492928	So, uh...
6495363	6497023	Hey, Yuna was not annoying!
6497063	6498844	That was my roommate contributing there, Yuna.
6498864	6499904	That was awful.
6500024	6502545	She needed to die.
6502565	6502605	No!
6505085	6510146	Wow, I think that's like the first time I think my roommate's kind of gotten into the video game discussion here on the program.
6510246	6512707	Usually he turns his nose up at the show.
6513447	6516808	He's cooking something that smells delightful right outside the door, though.
6517645	6521708	Yeah, what's funny is we have the Vornado bringing out... That's how we finally fixed our air conditioning problem.
6521728	6525110	We bought a Vornado to suck in air conditioning from the house and blow it out here.
6525470	6529192	But tonight, since the roommate is cooking... It sucks and it blows.
6529292	6534576	His very delightful dish is... We can smell nothing but that out here because it's sucking air from the kitchen.
6534816	6536277	Anyway, sorry.
6537444	6540368	So another one from Rob.
6541389	6546655	I haven't really read the article, but he said, I got this link in GamePolitics.com.
6546735	6549819	A judge disenfranchises the class in class action suit.
6550660	6553824	And it's about the Grand Theft Auto thing.
6554084	6555045	I'll link it in the chat room.
6556466	6562909	I'm actually a little surprised since the original suit was not over state laws, but just about getting more than you paid for.
6563610	6569752	I'd rather be broken by proving the class didn't actually exist.
6573414	6576215	I also retract my E3 2008 is boring comment.
6576555	6581537	If you really dig into the third party games and the non-big announcements, there are a lot of good information.
6581617	6587180	My original opinion was based all on the A-list games news being leaked to the interwebs.
6587820	6589621	So it was spoiled for me.
6589861	6593262	Level up, you now have three character points to apply towards your stats, Rob.
6593582	6594042	With two Bs.
6595603	6597344	And I'm just looking at this article real quick.
6597364	6598804	Can I put three points in awesomeness?
6599465	6599585	Okay.
6600025	6600205	Okay.
6601924	6615066	um it said that the settlement over the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas um uh settlement was actually hitting a snag because they're saying on there that the those who were to benefit from the uh
6616921	6619223	That class that they're referring to actually isn't there.
6620604	6624928	Because not everybody knew about it until something came out on the internet.
6625248	6626229	But I'll link this in the chat room.
6626729	6627710	It's an interesting little article.
6629271	6638579	For anyone who's interested, just go to... It's actually on the New York Times blog where I linked it to me in the technology section.
6639059	6642802	Just look up Settlement Over Sex Scenes in Grand Theft Auto Hits a Snag.
6644543	6645324	I'll link it in the chat room.
6646045	6646365	That's it.
6647466	6653067	Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Alright.
6653187	6654547	It's dot com.
6656068	6660008	We have a couple more news articles for you guys, and then we're going to be opening up the Skype line.
6660028	6662629	1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
6663889	6664069	Yeah.
6664329	6665109	It's not just coincidence.
6665589	6673931	Well, it's only fair since Rock Band's getting really awesome peripherals from a third-party company, that Guitar Hero World Tour gets...
6674787	6676831	Awesome peripherals from a third-party company.
6677552	6688890	The third-party company providing these would be Logitech, and of course they already make the USB microphones that are used by almost all of the music games out there right now.
6690367	6696113	They're going to be doing some high-end guitars and drum sets as well.
6696253	6707246	No word exactly what features these will have, but if it's Logitech, you can probably guess it's going to be put together at least pretty well.
6707406	6710830	I guess we'll just have to wait and see when they show these off.
6714738	6719221	Yay, more peripherals to put on the Best Buy shelves and other gaming stores to take up space.
6719261	6720842	Well, these things are damn expensive.
6720862	6726866	I mean, if it's anything like that $299 drum set, which I do still want.
6727167	6730549	I don't know why, because I don't play Rock Band, but I want it anyways.
6731430	6740956	Speaking of music games, I've been kind of brainstorming how I would make a game like Beatmania 2DX work, and I've thought about a game that would combine Beatmania 2DX and poppin' music.
6741556	6742937	I think it would be actually kind of cool.
6744900	6746804	I just wish I had a game company to make it for me.
6748242	6748682	Moving on.
6749103	6749763	Not that anyone cares.
6750623	6751964	But Jamie's going to care about this one.
6751984	6754685	This is a news article just for you, DarkSakura.
6755005	6755625	Yes.
6755925	6757346	It's about Ragnarok Online.
6757766	6760287	Not just that, but Ragnarok Online DS.
6761667	6762428	Now here's the thing.
6762448	6766249	This was announced quite some time ago, and now we're starting to wonder, is this game ever going to come out?
6766669	6767850	Well, here's the thing.
6768350	6771791	Ragnarok Online on the DS, it's not actually going to be an MMO.
6772111	6773172	You don't get to play it with other people.
6773192	6774052	I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be.
6774272	6775473	Right, and that kind of makes sense.
6775513	6782718	But it is going to be a single-player role-playing game that apparently has some online features in it, whatever that means.
6783658	6791023	Some screenshots have come out for the game this week as well, and it does have that same chibi style that you've come to know and love from the original Ragnarok Online.
6791203	6793305	I looked at the pictures and I saw a bunny band.
6794385	6796947	Apparently you do have gestural attack inputs.
6796987	6799569	You use the stylus to kind of draw your attacks and things like that.
6799849	6802451	December 18th is the day this comes out overseas.
6803251	6803632	Import!
6804554	6805094	I bet you will.
6805394	6805975	You know I will.
6806895	6807335	I know you will.
6807355	6808956	Whether or not I can read most of it or not.
6809276	6821120	You know what I know will happen right now is that we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and we're going to take a few calls here on this Part B of our show tonight.
6822040	6824301	We actually kind of jammed through the stories part of our show tonight.
6824341	6825901	It's only about 8.15 on the West Coast.
6825941	6826762	That's not bad.
6826782	6829142	Because here we've got a 10-minute late start tonight.
6829182	6829823	That's not bad at all.
6829943	6831443	For a moment I thought you said on the East Coast.
6831463	6832103	I'm like, wait, what?
6832323	6833184	No, no, no.
6833204	6833444	8.15 here.
6833504	6835945	But usually we don't get to the skyline until like 9 o'clock.
6836065	6837225	So we're doing good tonight.
6837245	6840866	1-877-GAME-OLR.
6840906	6841807	It's not ringing right now.
6841867	6843927	So, Loki, do you have any last- I should start with DarkSakura.
6843947	6845828	Do you have any last-minute stories for us?
6846908	6847589	No, not really.
6848269	6848389	Loki?
6848429	6848649	Loki?
6850161	6853183	I haven't really been looking at last minute stories.
6853403	6854224	Oh, here's some.
6854564	6855724	Yay.
6855844	6856665	Sony's Life.
6856905	6862348	You may remember that as their version of the globe spinning news thing.
6862448	6864809	So that's not coming out right away.
6865049	6865870	It's been delayed.
6866730	6867931	Wow, surprise.
6868371	6869852	Sony delaying something?
6870833	6871313	Yeah.
6871813	6872094	Anyways.
6872714	6873875	Rock Band, download content.
6873895	6878158	We've got some stuff coming out this week, including Crew Fest Pack 2.
6878738	6884962	And we're going to be getting with that Face Down in the Dirt by Motley Crue for 80 points or a dollar.
6885883	6889145	Rescue Me by Buckcherry, another 80 points or a dollar.
6889525	6891987	And Life is Beautiful by 6AM.
6892767	6894409	And that's also 80 points or a dollar.
6894509	6895349	Whole Pack for $2.40 or $3.
6896990	6914133	and then each they're going to have individual songs for BYOB from System of a Down for two bucks and Toxicity from System of a Down also two bucks and you remember those were part of the System of a Down exclusive download content for when you bought their album so that's kind of interesting
6915394	6917415	LastGuy.jp
6947711	6949092	Skyline's open and no one's calling.
6949112	6949612	That's weird.
6949872	6951312	I just checked it to make sure it works.
6951392	6953533	I call 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6953653	6956254	Well, it happens sometimes.
6956895	6963738	I was supposed to be looking up stories, but I was working on trying to get the Wiimotes to work with that Love is Blind game.
6964198	6965898	You know, the one that makes the sex noises.
6967799	6970200	Apparently my Bluetooth adapter says, Fuck you, Wiimote.
6970280	6971721	I ain't working with you, bitch.
6972581	6974202	So now we get to play the chat.
6975782	6976462	No, we can.
6977062	6978363	They have a keyboard version, too.
6978663	6979343	Oh, well, hooray.
6979363	6983124	That's a little bonus thing after the show, right?
6983164	6984044	Yes.
6984424	6990845	I found, by accident, a funny MMO that's all about getting laid and partying.
6992045	6992745	Right.
6992905	6995746	It's some sort of social networking thing, but I thought it was hilarious.
6995786	6996946	It was called Red Light Center.
6997666	6998566	I just thought it was funny.
6999927	7002087	I don't think I'm going to play it, but I think it was funny.
7006945	7007665	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
7007685	7016687	The only other story I had was Ubisoft localizing Armored Core 4 Answer for the US, and it should be coming out in September, and that's kind of cool, I guess.
7016787	7019148	Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by Armored Core 4.
7020168	7021328	I don't know if I'll pick this up.
7022148	7025309	Probably not, but I don't know.
7025449	7026529	Can't get too excited anymore.
7026569	7027950	I used to love Armored Core games.
7027970	7029690	You just buy every single one that came out, but
7031519	7031799	Oh well.
7032239	7036080	Oh, I guess I did miss a game that was supposed to be coming out on the Wii and DS this week.
7036420	7037440	Little League World Series 2008.
7039001	7039701	I know, sad.
7040381	7044862	Oh, and this week on Xbox Live Arcade, we've got Braid for like 15 bucks.
7045062	7046022	Is that game supposed to be cool?
7046042	7046943	It looked kind of neat from the previews.
7046963	7047583	It's supposed to be pretty cool.
7047603	7052444	You can kind of like, imagine like a 2D platform game with the Sands of Time built into it.
7053864	7054864	Finally, our phone's ringing.
7055805	7056725	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7056745	7057065	Who's this?
7058032	7060473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7088044	7089425	Yeah, did you like the pictures I sent?
7089465	7091566	Yes, they were really hard to see on my phone.
7091586	7095268	I liked the, was it, you sent me Knights or Riala, one of them.
7095768	7096669	I think I sent you both.
7096949	7099130	I got a Frankenfurter one.
7099330	7099791	I know.
7100111	7101712	I see, I see, Scott, I see.
7101992	7103573	I also got a Bubble Bobble.
7103593	7104353	Heart.
7104613	7105154	One, there you go.
7105274	7105774	Heart.
7105794	7108335	Right, I heart NY, there you have it.
7109076	7111377	All right, so how was the con?
7111417	7112378	What con was it you went to?
7112398	7113018	It was called what?
7113998	7114739	Kineticon.
7114779	7115579	Kineticon.
7116100	7116520	How was that?
7118075	7119778	Much better than I thought it was.
7120980	7123305	It gave me a Fanime feel to it, so you know what that means.
7123345	7125268	I'll be going back to that convention next year.
7125989	7127512	Aw, Fanime's a good time.
7127532	7128394	Fanime's a great con artist.
7132838	7136900	I got there like late Friday night because I had to work and I missed my bus.
7137040	7138561	But I got there Saturday.
7138641	7139762	I left my camera.
7139802	7141042	It showed up about an hour later.
7141642	7146345	It wasn't as packed, but it was just like really roomy, really flowing.
7146525	7150927	And then when I got to the room, my roommate tells me, oh, there's going to be furries here.
7151127	7151327	What?
7153208	7154789	That was exactly my reaction.
7156469	7159651	Correct me if I'm wrong, Ranma, but did you not say that you missed the bus?
7161195	7162156	Yeah, good Friday.
7162196	7162877	I missed the bus.
7162897	7170605	I was stuck waiting at Greyhound for about almost an hour to get my ticket changed.
7171325	7172887	I see what you did there, sir.
7176871	7177452	I couldn't help it.
7177492	7177912	I'm sorry.
7177972	7179153	I know it's probably not funny.
7179654	7181376	But in years, you'll look back and laugh at it.
7182497	7183638	It's all good, man.
7183698	7184399	It's all good.
7187520	7191223	Well, I have to ask, what gaming things were going on at the convention?
7193244	7195065	Would you believe I saw DDR?
7195885	7197286	Oh my, at an anime convention?
7197346	7198487	DDR you don't say.
7199327	7202929	Let me guess, was there Smash Brothers?
7203990	7204550	Yes there was.
7205971	7206532	I'll be damned.
7207612	7208753	Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
7209013	7210534	Was there Guitar Hero?
7210554	7210594	No.
7212013	7213034	I'm on a fucking roll.
7213094	7213494	Look at this.
7213554	7216116	I'm like the psychic con man.
7216136	7218517	Was there a Naruto game?
7221139	7223501	Actually, not in the dealer's room.
7223761	7227963	One of the gaming dealers was showing off one of the Naruto games for PlayStation 2.
7228203	7229284	Wait, hold on, hold on.
7229304	7230785	Psychic con man.
7230845	7231466	Hold on, hold on.
7233487	7239891	Was there a woman overweight dressed as Sailor Moon?
7241949	7246392	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7274013	7276522	Was there an overweight man dressed as Sailor Moon?
7278206	7281787	I actually know, believe it or not, there really wasn't any overweight people.
7281847	7285348	There was, but most of them were wearing Lolita outfits and long corsets.
7285668	7294391	Because KineticCon is a combination of a majority of a webcomic convention with anime, sci-fi, fantasy.
7294951	7298493	I forget his name, but the guy that played Neelix on Voyager was there.
7299833	7301914	Ethan something, isn't his name?
7302634	7304094	You didn't get me his autograph, did you?
7305235	7305835	I had no money.
7308487	7310648	I didn't even know he was here until I showed up Saturday.
7311409	7312429	Okay, I forgive you.
7312950	7316552	I'm getting you Amino's autograph.
7316612	7318773	I mean, that should be something.
7318813	7319414	I found my book.
7319494	7320454	Finally, I found my book.
7321355	7321655	Woot.
7322095	7324176	Yes, DJ Ratchet, there was anime.
7324337	7325057	Tons of it.
7325257	7326178	I'll be sending you my book.
7326598	7328279	Ranma, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, okay?
7329019	7329380	You too.
7329400	7329600	Later.
7331206	7331906	That's great.
7333047	7335147	Something tells me the callers are fairly apathetic tonight.
7335167	7336968	Thank you, Ethan Phillips.
7337008	7337488	That's his name.
7337808	7338209	The other one.
7338389	7338829	You know what?
7338849	7341230	Tuvok is from Sacramento.
7341250	7344051	I've never seen him, but I see stories about him on the local news once in a while.
7344611	7346952	Celebrity Tim something.
7346992	7347552	What's his name?
7348592	7349293	Tim something?
7350213	7351393	What the hell is Tuvok's name?
7351433	7351954	I don't remember.
7352594	7352854	Oh, well.
7353134	7353754	Let's go to the phones.
7353774	7354294	We have another call.
7354334	7355175	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
7355195	7355515	Who's this?
7356809	7357790	Oh my god, we got through.
7358350	7358970	Yes, we did.
7358990	7361752	Whoa, we've got like a party chat on the line.
7361812	7362712	Introduce yourselves.
7364393	7366934	Oh, this isn't like a party line from like the 80s or something?
7367295	7368355	I know.
7368495	7369356	It's party chat.
7370756	7372477	We should meet up at Chuck E. Cheese afterwards.
7372617	7373398	Who's on the line?
7375499	7379021	We've got Toshin, FootyMonster, JackRansom, and TheRobD.
7379501	7381242	Wow, it's like an all-games party line.
7382469	7383190	It is a party line.
7383530	7386233	Awesome.
7386313	7387054	Call 1-900.
7387074	7387514	1-900.
7387574	7388455	It's always a party.
7388596	7389336	That's the way it rolls.
7390097	7391418	To what do we owe this phone call tonight?
7392780	7395843	I just wanted to say I beat your deadline score on Geometry Wars and you're going down.
7396143	7396544	F you.
7397165	7397485	F you.
7399427	7400848	I just did it like five seconds ago.
7400989	7403992	Geometry Wars brings out the most competitive in all of us, doesn't it?
7406060	7407941	How about my pacifism score?
7408422	7412125	Dude, I played pacifism for an hour trying to get that stupid wax off achievement.
7412165	7413386	Have you beat my pacifism score?
7415087	7415868	I don't think so.
7416709	7418090	At least I'm still cool at something.
7419619	7420159	Thanks for watching!
7441047	7441868	It's so crazy.
7442388	7443429	You don't pause the game at all.
7443469	7446091	Just while you're playing it, hit the right bumper, not the trigger, but the bumper.
7446351	7449734	Hit right bumper and the back button, and you can render the field in 3D.
7449814	7450355	It's so cool.
7451436	7456219	And then if you touch the dot in the room with the dragon ducks, then you can see created by Warren Robinette, and it's awesome.
7456560	7459322	It's like that.
7460063	7462024	But in 3D, dude.
7462044	7462284	3D.
7463926	7465427	How do you go back?
7465767	7467549	Because now it's in the middle of my game.
7467629	7468870	Hit right bumper and back again.
7470026	7471447	Geometry Wars Geometry Wars Geometry Wars
7494406	7495207	I'm totally screwed.
7495227	7495927	I called Microsoft.
7495947	7497628	They said, basically, well, fuck you.
7497688	7498108	We don't care.
7499709	7501070	So I'm out of $500 and a 360.
7501350	7502131	It's awesome.
7502831	7503512	That sucks.
7503732	7505273	That is crappy customer service.
7506134	7507534	I mean, I understand you're an original.
7507574	7508635	I didn't really do business with it.
7508655	7512257	I tried messaging through Twitter to Major Nelson to try my luck there.
7512838	7513939	Of course, nothing happened.
7513979	7515660	Yeah, he probably gets 500 emails a day.
7516860	7517661	It sucks, though.
7517941	7523362	I will say this before I end my part of talking here, because I know you probably have a lot more calls to take.
7523822	7525643	Actually, not really tonight.
7525783	7530724	Rhythm Heaven or Rhythm Tengoku Gold on the DS, you guys need to play that.
7530904	7536305	I know there's a lot of Rhythm fans in the audience, Rhythm game fans.
7536805	7537505	You need to play that.
7537545	7542386	It's like the WarioWare game of Rhythm games, and it's so fun.
7542746	7545087	Tell us really quickly, is that what the game's like, WarioWare?
7547448	7553612	Yeah, imagine each stage, four or five mini-games per stage, with a final stage being a remix.
7554253	7558415	Each game is totally different in gameplay, and it's a small song, or a small thingy.
7559296	7566220	And from that, you advance the remix stage, and in the remix you play all those mini-games crumpled together into one cohesive song.
7566601	7568782	So you gotta switch gameplays on the fly all the time.
7569482	7572203	and it goes like that for many, many levels and it's so fun.
7572404	7577066	Great music, really catchy, the action on the cellos works perfectly and it's so fun.
7578506	7578866	Alright.
7579287	7580967	Sounds pretty cool.
7581327	7594213	I've just been playing an old copy of Super Robot Wars Alpha I got from a friend a while ago since I'll be going to Otakon next week to see Jam Project and actually I'm going to meet up with Rama probably.
7594953	7598175	DJ Dark Knight was too lame to go even though Rama and I offered to pay his way
7600212	7608420	What about games you've been playing, JackRansom?
7610222	7616728	Well, my PSP miraculously, after a year and a half, fixed itself this weekend, so I decided I'd go out and pick up Patapon.
7617868	7644806	Pata, Pata, Pata, Pawn Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom That game is nuts It's freaking nuts and I absolutely love it I forgot how many god damn great games there were on the PSP You start hearing those little drum beats in your sleep if you play that game long enough It's terrible, you're lying there trying to go to sleep Pawn, Pawn, Pata, Pawn Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom I cannot wait to get to that stage because at the moment I need more of that game, I want more of that game I'm loving it

7671225	7673605	If you add it all up, it's the price of Soul Calibur 4.
7673826	7674826	So honestly, it's...
7676513	7677533	That also kicks ass.
