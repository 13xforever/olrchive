00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Roto!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, August 24th, 2008, the Guitar Hero be adding yet another instrument to the mix,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sony announces the iPad, and rumors of an Xbox motion controller begin to circulate yet again.

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We missed you last week, our aim is improving though, isn't it Dark Sakura? Jamie Summers, lovely co-host of OLR.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Splaat! And speaking of shooting things, say hello to Tech Master Loki, who apparently spent this morning shooting people in the face.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes. And getting shot in the face. I went and played Airsoft, it's a new hobby I'm getting into now.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Nice. What's Airsoft for the uninitiated?

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Airsoft is kind of like paintball, but instead of actually shooting balls of paint at people, you have kind of like souped up BB guns that shoot plastic pellets at people.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And actually it doesn't hurt at all.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So you're not shooting balls at people's face?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We are shooting balls at people's face.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not going to judge.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Tiny little white balls.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Depending on their color BBs.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Alright. But did you win or did you lose?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Actually we won three.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How does one win or lose? Just don't get shot? You win?

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, because we had different scenarios for each one we played.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The first game we played was you had to occupy, there was like a, they call them kill houses, they were basically little structures that they built.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And the first game you had to be the team that's occupying that at the end of the 30 minute match.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And then the second game that I sat out on was a capture the flag game.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then the third game we came back, it was also kind of capture the flag, but basically capturing a sniper post.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And you'd get the flag and raise it and wave it in the air.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And then the last game was just played on the field sideways and was basically just kill the other team.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And it's kind of cool though because it's like a video game because you get different respawns.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So if you get shot you have to go back to this one spot and when three people get there you all respawn and stuff like that.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Wow, they actually say respawns. Are there video games based on this out of curiosity?

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Not like dodge ball video games? No, no airsoft games. Tons of paintball games but no airsoft.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The ever present fourth co-host on our show, you through the chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And poor Leno in chat says airsoft rocks. Airsoft rocks.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's pretty fun. I have a, I bought a P90 which is like the Stargate machine gun type thing.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Not because I like Stargate, because I don't, but just because it looks neat and it's shot well.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And then I have a sidearm as well so I was playing the entire game with a sidearm and you know the P90.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And actually at one point I charged at people with the P90 in one hand because you can fire it with one hand and then the sidearm and I got shot.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But it was still fun.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Dark Dead Studios says wow, OLR is getting violent. I know lots of gun talk tonight.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's OLR and gun night. It's gun show night on OLR.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Did I tell you that I'm going to be, that I've got a rifle?

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh my gosh, too many guns.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No, I have a.22 caliber rifle. Dan's going to take me out shooting, but I told him that I wanted my own handgun.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's one thing I have no interest in, unless it's a laser gun. Laser guns are alright.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, there was a very good point made, that if everybody in the country could have a concealed weapon on them, even if they did or didn't, do you think someone's going to be likely to attack someone who could be armed?

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You know I'm still not a gun fan, but we're not going to talk politics tonight because we've got games to talk about.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It was Ragnarok-tastic, and I also played Final Fantasy 6 while I had jury duty last week.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Now you know, I don't think there's guns in Ragnarok.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes there are.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There's a gunslinger class. You could even have a humongous gatling gun. It's freaking sexy.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My favorite class in Final Fantasy 11 since you brought up Final Fantasy was Corsair, and they used guns, and that was pretty cool.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Guns are fun in video games.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Pirates like guns.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Anyhow, sorry, Final Fantasy 6, yes.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I played some of that while I had jury duty, and I was very pissed off that I was one alternate away from getting on the trial, and it was like a little three day criminal trial, and I was looking forward to it.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So I didn't get on the trial, disappointment, blah blah, cry cry, wham.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Aw, you don't get to do your civic duty. Well I mean, you kind of did, but you know what I mean.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, but I met some cool people and watched the Olympics, which was kind of eh.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And then really that's about all I played, except for playing a lot of solitaire on my iPhone.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Do you have Michael Phelps fever? I know this has nothing to do with video games, but at the same time he'll probably have a game or something named after him in the future.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I do not, but I did go looking at pictures on the interwebs today of people kissing during the Olympics, and there was a guy kissing his horse.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What? What the? Okay!

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There was like people kissing their medals, and you know, like couples kissing, you know, and there actually, I was looking at the marksman competition, and there was a wife who won the gold, and her husband won the silver in one of the marksman competitions.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But they were actually really cute. You would be watching the marksman competitions.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, so I like guns, and I especially think it was hilarious that, you know, the last time there was the guy who shot the wrong target that was further away than the target he was supposed to do and hit it perfectly.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I just want to warn you all tonight in chat room, don't piss Jamie off tonight, she's prepared.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, I'm armed and dangerous. I've got two of them.

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm armed and fabulous.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That has, you know, not the sunnies, I have the patella. I have my humerus and my radius.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Alright. Low-key, tell us something about your gaming...

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
My biceps break your eye too.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That doesn't involve guns or Michael Phelps.

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, I can guarantee one of the two of those. Michael Phelps sucks.

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I hope to God they don't make a game, because really, how exciting...

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can send that hate mail to lokioworangelaunchradio.com

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How exciting could a game be that's all swimming? I mean...

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Wii Sports 2, I thought.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Swimming in Wii Sports 2, wait for it.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The Olympic games are boring enough, you know, not the game as in the actual Olympics, but the games made about the Olympics.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Those are boring. And let alone just, you know, cutting out all the other events that you might find exciting and just leaving swimming in there.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
See, call me sick, but the things I like about the Olympics, I don't really like the dream stories about like Michael Phelps.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I mean, yeah, great swimmer and all, I'm not going to knock him, but that's the stuff that's boring to me.

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I like the crazy stuff, like the craziness that happens in the Olympics, like the weightlifter who had to get the paramedics stalled in on him.

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And Frisbee in chat says, who saw the Cuban guy get mad and kick the ref? That's the kind of stuff I love about the Olympics.

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Or the guy that bit that guy in the shoulder, the boxer.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The Jerry Springer stuff you won't see on NBC, yes.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you have Blue on your friends list on LiveJournal?

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No, sadly I do not.

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He posted a translation of an article that I thought was a really sweet article, and I want to mention it real quick, about the South Korean women's handball team.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Right, because they were already ahead, they were going to win the bronze, but their coach pulled out, called a timeout right before, and put in all the old players.

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The ones that were, not old, but older players, that used to be their last Olympics, so that they could be in the winning match, and all be the ones to take home the medal.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because they wouldn't be able to do another Olympics.

97
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And some of them were housewives, and their children were watching, and so he put like I think four people that would have to retire after this Olympics in the match for the last few minutes of the game.

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'd be fucking pissed.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why is it that all Olympic video games usually suck? Like I don't remember playing an Olympics video game thinking, wow that was awesome. You know what I mean?

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Because none of the crazy stuff happens in the video game.

101
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think that's a darn good explanation. We don't get that crazy stuff happening. We need more craziness.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And whoever's developing London 2012 for next gen consoles, make it happen. Give us the crazy.

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Alright, I'm sorry. Gaming week, my bad.

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Anyways, um, well the games I play, sorry.

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
JoeShe16 says someone should put Michael Phelps in place of Echo the Dolphin. That would be cool.

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That would be cool, I'd play that.

107
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Phelps the Dolphin, exactly, Frisbee. Alright, sorry.

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Chat.orangelandradio.com if you want to join this.

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Michael the Phelps.

110
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay. Um, so I play basically Bionic Commando Rearmed, which is awesome and I love Bionic Commando. So, you know, pretty much the game is as frustrating as the original, which is fine.

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And, I don't know, I enjoy it quite a bit.

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And then, I played more Grand Theft Auto IV, because that's what I do, and I just have to address this because I have had a lot of people sending me requests to play with them for, you know, different games.

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Listen, if I'm at work, if it's during the day, yes I'm online playing, you know, Grand Theft Auto twice a day or possibly three times a day depending on lunch.

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Um, but I'm not going to play with you during those times because I have other people playing with me. I have five other people that play, and I've tried to get other people in there, but they don't want outside people playing, so, sorry.

115
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But, I don't know.

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You need to set up certain hours.

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Exactly. And, you know, I'm not trying to be rude and I would love to type back to you, but I'm limited on time and typing on the fucking, you know, Xbox controller sucks.

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So, I don't know.

119
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You need to get it to light up USB keyboard like mine for the 360.

120
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I have the chat pad. I have it at home, but I just, you know, I don't have it at work. And I don't have a headset at work either, so I can't, you know, tell you no.

121
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But, um, I don't know. Other than that, um, I meant to download Galaga Legions because that looked kind of cool, but I never did. So, I'm just not going to.

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I am highly looking forward to this week, though, with the release of Castle Crashers. Oh my god, it's going to be awesome.

123
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So, that's what I'll be playing.

124
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I hope you're not pumping something up for disappointment. That's why I have no feelings whatsoever about Castle Crashers.

125
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, Alien Hominid is pretty awesome, and Castle Crashers, just all the video looks freaking awesome.

126
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Alright, I've got to say this, even though this was sent over a private message, and I usually don't encourage people to send me chat comments over a private message because it's a bit overwhelming.

127
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is pretty funny. Tigerclaw, going on the Olympic thing, said, what about the one female water polo player who had her breasts exposed all over the net?

128
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's another good example of the dark side.

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How did I miss that? Oh, I know, because it's water polo, and I would never watch it.

130
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But I'm thinking, you know, I could go for some boobs in my Olympic games. Yes, Dark Sakura?

131
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm looking on the internet right now.

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Here's what we were talking about, because, you know, obviously when we were watching the Olympics, you know, you have to heckle it because it's fun.

133
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But we were watching men's diving, and I was like, wouldn't it be awesome if, now, that's a sport I'll watch.

134
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Wouldn't it be awesome if those diving boards have, like, some sort of pneumatic thing on them that launched them into the air really high?

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I mean, that would be fucking awesome. They're doing, like, you know, ten somersaults in the air and stuff. I mean, come on.

136
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Who wouldn't watch that? And then they have BMX bike racing in this Olympics. That's not really an Olympic sport.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Or a little Benny Hill-style gag that when the divers dive off the board, there's like a little device, like a little hook or something that just rips their swimsuit right off as they're falling.

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Men and women, you know, for everybody, you know. And then the music plays.

139
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Ah, forget it.

140
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I did think it's kind of cool, though, that when they're doing, like, the whitewater rafting event or something like that, I'm like, that's pretty cool. It's like having that, you know, water ride from, like, Great America in there.

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Gsquared68 asks if you're talking about the man cannon from Halo.

142
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Exactly. That's what they need to have, a man cannon.

143
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That should be an Olympic event, man cannon.

144
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Man cannon? I like that. Hey.

145
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And woman cannon. You know, man and women.

146
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I smell a new list, or not list list, or something like that.

147
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
A new dream game?

148
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Not a dream game, but just like, you know.

149
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's an expansion upon the dream games. It's an Olympic event.

150
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No, a list list. The Olympic events that you'd want to see.

151
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, we might have to do that in the near future.

152
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe we can convince Bobby to do a live list list at PAX somehow when we're there for the panel, which we'll talk more about in a little while.

153
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Moving on, though, anything else in your gaming week you want to share, Logie?

154
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's all that I remember.

155
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Alright, I actually haven't played a lot new this week. I had a very busy personal life this week.

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And I don't feel right basing reviews off demos alone, but I will say I did at least play the demos for Force Unleashed, which I enjoyed.

157
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I have some reservations about the full game, but I'll check out the full game and see if that carries over.

158
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But I enjoyed myself more than I thought I would for a 3D action game, which usually isn't my kind of thing.

159
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm not even that into Star Wars either, but I liked the apprentice guy, a Starkiller or whatever his name is in Soul Calibur, and I thought, ah, what the hell, I'll check out Force Unleashed. It might be fun.

160
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's interesting. Very interesting.

161
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I also checked out the new Galaga game on Xbox Live, the Galaga Legion, the new souped up one.

162
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I had a lot of fun with the demo for that one. I probably will end up upgrading to the full version and tell you more about it later.

163
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But I was very pleased that it's much faster paced than the old Galaga, because it's really hard to go back and play the old 80's Galaga these days.

164
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I mean, no disrespect to a true classic game that brought us so many, inspired so many other great space games, but it's nice to have something very fast paced and competitive for a shooter.

165
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't know Dark Soccer, if you haven't checked out Galaga Legion yet, I think this is a game you'd really enjoy.

166
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What did you think?

167
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Flashy. Very flashy.

168
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, well the other big game that's been going on in our house was Bionic Commando.

169
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Alright, I checked that out too, I did download that.

170
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I haven't played enough of it yet, I don't want to review it yet, but I'm having fun with it.

171
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And I really enjoyed the new soundtrack, I gotta say. Very happy with that.

172
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ryoma in chat says, I destroy a Galaga. Awesome.

173
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Alright, Dark Tetsuya says, and now representing the USA in the 1000 meter man cannon, Rob Roberts.

174
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Love it.

175
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Gerardimo in chat says, Pac-Man Championship Edition is to Pac-Man as Galaga Legion is to R-Type.

176
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, it's kind of true, the Galaga Legion isn't really a lot like Galaga at all, actually.

177
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But it's fun. I had a really good time playing it.

178
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I was thinking it was going to be too much like Geometry Wars, and we just had that a few weeks ago, but it's different enough.

179
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's different enough.

180
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, and of course the big thing on all of our minds,

181
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Penny Arcade Expo is next week, it's going to be awesome.

182
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sadly there will be no live Orange Lounge radio next week, because we're going to be on a plane coming back,

183
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but you know what, you're going to have plenty to hold you over.

184
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Not only are we going to be a part of the live coverage with AllGames.com,

185
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
they're doing some live stuff every day starting at 4 Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern.

186
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They're doing coverage Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from the floor.

187
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We're going to be a part of that. We won't be there the whole time, but we will definitely be dropping in and spending a good chunk of time with them.

188
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Especially if he has Nintendo on, because I have to heckle them.

189
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Alright, but we'll also be doing our own stuff, and we haven't exactly decided what we're doing.

190
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I know there will be video involved to some extent, because we'll want to shoot some video from the floor,

191
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
so we'll be showing you some things via our YouTube channel, and giving you updates via our brand new Twitter,

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
which I also wanted to mention. We have a brand new Twitter at Twitter.com.

193
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The username, very easy, O-L-R is our Twitter name. So follow us on Twitter, we'll be giving you updates from the floor,

194
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
letting you know what to expect, and a couple podcasts from PAX as well. It'll be fun!

195
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Are you guys getting excited about PAX? What are you guys most looking forward to at PAX?

196
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
For me, the networking. I can't wait to meet other podcasters, because a whole crap load of them are going to be there.

197
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Not just in the All Games Network, but other indie podcasters. I'm looking forward to the networking.

198
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I want to see which celebrity I bump into this year. Like at E3.

199
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Alright, Loki?

200
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I need to smack Konami upside their head, because seriously, I don't know what they're doing.

201
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They're not showing at PAX.

202
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Well good! We don't have anything to show.

203
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Alright, if you guys want to meet us, we'll be around the show floor, and most certainly at the All Games broadcast going on right by the Sumo Lounge.

204
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on and talk about, I plugged the Twitter, I plugged Penny Arcade Expo.

205
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We'll be playing a promo for the Penny Arcade Expo coverage tonight during our free break.

206
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Stay tuned for that right after party is over, but for now, news! Loki, start us off tonight.

207
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Anyways, I'm sure everyone's seen the information about the Space Invaders meets 9-11 art exhibit that was at Leipzig.

208
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's basically kind of a homemade version of the game, attacking the Twin Towers.

209
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And it has some sort of interactive elements with it where people can actually put their hand over this railing that's near the exhibit.

210
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And it will fire bullets up at the screen, killing the Space Invaders.

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But, you know, it's pretty much impossible to win, so the towers always get destroyed.

212
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And apparently people, you know, are like, too soon! Too soon!

213
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So, I don't know. It's interesting.

214
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's basically the game's convention press release calls the installation an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy,

215
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and a social tale that can be related to historical tales without losing its poetic power.

216
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.

217
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Sounds like art fluff. Artsy speak.

218
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I, you know, I don't know. I will give you my opinion here in just a second, but there's some more.

219
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So, because this happened, of course the news got back to Taito, who responded by saying that they had no idea that this sort of thing was going on,

220
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and of course they obviously did not license Space Invaders for them to use,

221
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and they're going to take legal actions against the person who infringed upon their trademark.

222
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Uh oh. But then what happened, Loki?

223
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But then, the artist who put it up there decided to pull it.

224
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And basically, you know, after three days of steady downward spiral in the public discussion of the piece, I have just given my agreement to the organizers of Leipzig Games Convention to simply turn off the installation invaders.

225
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You had quite the little manifesto posted. I mean, it was a manifesto.

226
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, it was all contrary to previous reports. I am American, and it saddens me that people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside some obscure but tactically understood criteria of purely,

227
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
let's see, I have no idea what the hell he's trying to say here.

228
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Eh, whatever. Anyways.

229
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Uh, it's fancy talk.

230
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Fancy, what do you think? Fancy talk. Anyways.

231
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So, I think it's retarded that they took it out, because you can interpret it in many ways.

232
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:23,000
One, you can interpret it as, I think, based on the fact that people can interact with it and actually fire bullets from the bottom of the screen,

233
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:33,000
it's kind of invoking, like, togetherness. Basically, you have to, people have to come together if they want to overcome this great evil type thing.

234
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So you would need, you know, a lot more people firing bullets.

235
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You of all people, I never pegged for interpreting art in strange, mysterious ways. Very interesting, though.

236
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I have an interpretation of the reaction.

237
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
DarkSakura, I know you have strong opinions on this, because I heard you on Bobby's show, I see you type it in the chat now, what do you think?

238
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
People need to learn to be offended.

239
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Stop being a goddamn whiny bitch, get the stick out of your ass and deal with it.

240
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's the end of the story. I'm sorry, you don't like it, boo-fucking-who, okay?

241
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't like having to go to work, but guess what, I gotta.

242
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't like hearing, you know, my husband yell at playing Grand Theft Auto 4, but guess what, I gotta.

243
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I married him, it's my choice. You know, you, if you want to live in a country where you've got free speech, stay in America.

244
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You've got it, may as well flaunt it. If you don't want your free speech, by all means, move to North Korea or something.

245
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You know, but, if you, I think that if you want to be free to express your freedom of speech, you also need to let other people be free to express theirs.

246
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If you do not like it, shut the fuck up, that's what your blog is for.

247
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Or maybe if you didn't like it, and you just probably didn't understand the piece, and maybe if you asked the artist what he meant by it, there you go.

248
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But then again, at the same time, at the same time though, I kind of get from this, you know, artist or whatever, he was just trying to invoke a reaction.

249
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry, that's not an excuse for art.

250
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
No, that's what art is to be for. If you do a piece, and no one reacts to it, you have failed as an artist.

251
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But I don't think that just making an artistic piece just to get a reaction is considered art.

252
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Because, I mean, if you think about it, if I paint a painting that I want people to think is sad, you know, and if I invoke a sad reaction, then yes, mission accomplished for me.

253
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But, if, you know, I paint a painting that's just, you know, offensive, and people get offended by it, I don't know.

254
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That was your purpose. That's why you did the art. But the whole thing is that if people's comfort zones are not pushed, if people are not challenged to think, they're not going to.

255
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's gonna, you know, cause a very stagnant society. I mean, even think about, you know, some of the greatest artists of their time were so unappreciated in their time, told that their work was crap.

256
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yet, you know, years after they've died, they're now considered masterpieces. They're considered the, you know, geniuses of their age, the innovators.

257
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
If we didn't have people that challenged the way that people think, then there would be, I think, no cultural progression. That's what this is about.

258
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I think the problem comes down to that it's space invaders and not geometry wars.

259
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Look, I have an opinion on this too, which is, I kind of like mostly agree. Here's my thing, I mostly agree.

260
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because I'm all for free speech, that's this country we live in, this guy has a right to do, even though he's exhibiting in Germany, you know, whatever.

261
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I still support he has a right to say what he wants to say. I personally may go, that wasn't very smart, and I might go, well, the price you pay for expression is people disagreeing with you and going to be expressing their opinion in return.

262
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:53,000
That's kind of part of it, you know, a little bit of, if you open yourself up for that with your art, then you're going to get it back at you.

263
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But here's the thing, I actually understand why Taito's pissed.

264
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, now I agree, pulling it because of the licensing issue, I agree with that. He did use their licensed material without permission.

265
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Right, and here's the thing, it's not so much that I think Taito had a right to do it because of what is going on, but because people are so ignorant when they see this, they are going to think, oh, Taito or space invaders endorse this, or this is a gamer thing where gamers just want to pretend to blow up the train.

266
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You know all this ignorant crap that's out there in the media about video games, that people like Jack Voldemort just perpetuate, you know, this whole thing.

267
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So I understand why Taito's pissed, and I think the guy made a bad judgment in that regard where maybe he should have done something similar yet different, you know what I mean, if he was going to invoke such emotions.

268
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Parity is legal. Parity is legal. If we didn't have parity being legal, we would have no Jonathan Coulton or Weird Al. End of story.

269
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But I also, I think that he should have been a little, especially as an artist, he should have recognized the difference between, you know, stealing somebody else's intellectual property and done something.

270
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:20,000
He could have used the concept, I mean, how many video games do we have out there with, you know, aliens invading Earth, shoot. Die, aliens, bang bang. No, we've got a ton of games of those, so it wouldn't be any type of problem.

271
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Well, I'm offended. You know why I'm offended? Because I love aliens, and aliens are creatures too. Aliens are creatures of the great god of the universe, and I'm offended by these games where we just haphazardly kill aliens who only come in peace.

272
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You want to hear something really ironic about this whole story?

273
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
What? And that I'm sure that they didn't realize?

274
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What? Next week on the Japanese WiiWare service, Space Invaders Get Even will be released.

275
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That is great.

276
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You know, where the Space Invaders will destroy buildings.

277
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's like Rampage with aliens, that's great.

278
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But here's the thing, I bet you there are tons of paintings out there that depict the events of 9-11, a horrific tragedy in American times in very controversial ways.

279
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I bet there are tons of paintings out there and books and newspapers and movies that, but the funny thing is, the media is never going to show that to you because they love to pick on video games.

280
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That's why Taito's pissed.

281
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's all whatever is, you know, going to cause the biggest stir. It's already a hot topic right now.

282
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So, of course since, you know, basically since He Who Shall Not Be Named is getting disbarred, and basically having all of his arguments disproven in a public forum, they've got to find something else to keep that topic alive, right?

283
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Sharon in chat says, I'm offended by games where you kill monsters. I know plenty of monsters and they're not all like that. It's an unfair stereotype. I'm a monster activist, hear me roar.

284
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Hey look, we have a new segment on our show. It's involving our new Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR and we invite you guys to respond to one story every week before we go live.

285
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That way if you're not going to be here for the live show, you still have a chance to interact with us and we asked listeners tonight what they thought about this story.

286
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
GS68 on Twitter says, blaming terrorism on video games or inevitable destruction of civilization?

287
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
ActDeaf says, well if 9-11 wouldn't happen, this wouldn't even be catching the media's attention.

288
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Offensive, kind of, but there have been other stuff that have also done this.

289
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't, see for me, I'm like, you can't really, for me, I mean I respect what you're saying dude, but like 9-11 did happen. That's just something we all kind of like have to deal with.

290
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You know what I mean? I don't know. It's a weird statement to me.

291
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
PodCulture says, a bit too soon for stuff like that.

292
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Justin says, I think it was pretty tasteless and the guy was obviously going for press via controversy despite his insistence that he wasn't.

293
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
AlphaCananagram says, I think that it was a risky move by the artist. He must have known that he would piss people off, but he has the right to show it. Yum.

294
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Darktacuya says, I don't blame Taito for wanting to distance themselves from something so controversial. Talk about bad PR. Exactly what I'm saying yo.

295
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And Rama, as a New Yorker that lives here and works two blocks from ground zero, it doesn't bother me, really. Some people need to get their heads out of their asses.

296
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
There you go. Comments from our Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

297
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I just remember reading just how, you know, in fact, I honestly think that the biggest, you know, if people are so worried about, you know, recovery and about moving past it, then that's what they actually need to be doing.

298
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You know, recovering, moving past it, business as usual.

299
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Kind of the ideas of people who laugh at funerals. Yeah. You know, because sometimes that's the best way to deal with it is to laugh at it.

300
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And forgive me for being a little philosophical about this, but if their whole point of, you know, running airplanes into the buildings was to shake our, you know, our morale and to weaken us, wouldn't the biggest slap in their face back would be to go back to business as usual?

301
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We welcome your comments. Mailbag OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have further comments on the issue.

302
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
All right. And I'm sure there's a lot of people with very differing opinions on that. Let's get to some more gaming news tonight, though. And we're going to talk a lot about music games.

303
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And, you know, this game will not be coming to Xbox Live, this whole Space Invaders controversial thing.

304
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But guess what is? A very interesting report coming from BamaniStyle.com. They got the pictures to prove it. There's a new game coming out. It's called Beat and Groovy coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

305
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Now here's the thing about Beat and Groovy. If you look at the screenshots, it's a game you longtime Bamani fans know and love. The art style is just like that of pop and music.

306
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That's right. Pop and music looks like it is making its way to Xbox Live Arcade as beat and groovy.

307
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But instead of having a pop music controller, because obviously you can't get one of those through Xbox Live Arcades, instead you will be hitting five different colored buttons.

308
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:03,000
They're all different colors. Purple, blue, red, green, yellow. You use left arrow, up arrow, right arrow or X, Y or B, I'm sorry, Y or A, and then B are kind of like the different buttons.

309
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I should call my pop and music controller. Like old school Beatmania. But I don't know. Would a pop and music controller be able to convert to the Xbox and use it? I don't know.

310
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I wouldn't think there would be a problem with that as long as you take the circuit board out of the Xbox controller and map it into the Poppin'.

311
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Well I will bet there will be lots of third party support too. By the way, some of the songs already announced, some of the songs are supposed to be in this.

312
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Ryu with Starmind, the Poppin' Mix, DJ Taka with Moon, La La More, We Two Are One, Good Cool with Gotta Get My Groove On, and I know a lot of our listeners may have no idea who these people are.

313
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But there are lots of Bamani bands. If you've been listening to the DDR music for years and years, you know a lot of these folks. Of course you would know these guys.

314
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Orange Lounge with the 100 Second Kitchen Battle also supposed to be in this. Loki, what do you think as a long time music fan?

315
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Sounds evil. I think he's retarded. No seriously, because they had an opportunity to bring over a game that some of the fans were looking for and what are they trying to do?

316
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The problem with Konami, they're trying to bring on new people into their music games, I guess. They're trying to appeal to different people.

317
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Problem is, these types of games are bought by a certain group of people, and if you try to appeal to other people, they're not going to buy it.

318
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And I heard a rumor that pretty much those songs that you see on there, those seven songs, I think there was two more, that's it.

319
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well I'm sure there will be download things.

320
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What if this is a testing round?

321
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's stupid though, because at least with the music it's fine, because the music's good. The art style is kind of a slap in people's face, because it's not really pop music, it's just kind of like ghetto characters, I don't know.

322
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And at the same time, I don't know, this is in Rock Revolution, they don't know what they're doing.

323
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Comments from chat, Gsquared68 says, if it has Vic Viper as a character, maybe I might get a 360.

324
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Our faithless webmaster, our ever faithful webmaster says, I can't believe they kept pop music songs in the song list.

325
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I am kind of surprised that it's at least a bit of an authentic song list, all things considered, if this game is being targeted for the US as well.

326
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Very interesting, but of course very cheap for them too.

327
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And Katamari's Forever says pop music should have more pop, like Avril Lavigne and Leona Lewis, and I've been saying that for a long time, that that's one way they could try and grow their audience here.

328
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But they won't on Xbox Live Arcade.

329
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Exactly, but this is what they need to do in order to appeal to the original fans and to expand it.

330
00:32:46,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You take the game as it was, you add a lot of the songs that were originally in the game, or songs that should be in a pop music release, release it here, and you also add songs that people that may not be used to pop music would like.

331
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Like licensed songs or just songs that are really cool that kind of appeal, that aren't necessarily pop music types of music.

332
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Same should have been done with Rock Revolution.

333
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
They should have put some of the Bamani songs in there.

334
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And yes, I understand that Bamani songs may not translate well for your average Guitar Hero fan, but at the same time, the fans will appreciate it and they will buy the game because of that.

335
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And you can still have all those covers of licensed songs out there, so you can appeal to both people.

336
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Putting these songs that you have in your library anyway, it's not going to hurt nothing. It's going to add to the game.

337
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Let me try reading a couple more comments from chat here. Gerardimo has a very long comment here, but it's pretty good.

338
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
My problem right now is that people were bitching that Konami needed to Americanize their music games, but their hardcore fans got pissy because they wanted to keep in Konami songs.

339
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So Konami is trying to appeal to American audience by making it less cute to appeal to Americans, but still rewarding their hardcore fans.

340
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Now yes, they took out the controller, but perhaps they're just trying to test it.

341
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And then SSJ100Matt says, put ABBA in there. Yeah, that'll work. ABBA will make it all better.

342
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Absolutely.

343
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You know, again, I'm going to withhold judgment until I actually play the game. I do think it might be a little bit of a water-testing thing, but I don't know.

344
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Let's just say I'm not getting my expectations very high, but I'd love to have Konami folks come on the show and talk about the game.

345
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Could be very interesting. So, we shall see.

346
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Well, if you're looking for a seven-button controller, you remember that they are releasing a drum pad that has seven inputs on it.

347
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Well, too bad this game only uses five.

348
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Well, actually, it uses seven because you can use the two trigger buttons for the seven, whatever.

349
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
We'll see when it comes out.

350
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Anyway, shall I continue?

351
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
There is another peripheral that's going to be coming out for Guitar Hero 4, but Neversoft isn't saying what it is.

352
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The speculation, though, is that it's either going to be some type of keyboard or a turntable, because this is stated to work more specifically with the studio mode.

353
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I kind of think of a mixing board. I wouldn't be surprised to see a mixing board.

354
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Interesting. A lot of people speculate a keyboard, because that's like the obvious thing, but that would be interesting, a mixing board, like Kraken DJ.

355
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Dude, wouldn't that be cool? They do that, and then they actually release Kraken DJ. That'd be sweet.

356
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I don't know about that. Wasn't Kraken DJ a Sega thing?

357
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It was indeed.

358
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Or perhaps they could, I don't know, stop releasing peripherals. Seriously, four peripherals for this fucking game.

359
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Granted, it will probably be great, but seriously, it's a little overkill.

360
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I know people are really enthusiastic about making their songs and stuff like that, but...

361
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But they're totally in a penis envy war with Rock Band and all those folks right now.

362
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Whatever. They could try to get a jump on it, I guess. Release all the peripherals you want. I just won't buy them.

363
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So, whatever.

364
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Anyways, there's going to be some pretty cool stuff coming out for, well, another DS release of Guitar Hero.

365
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's Guitar Hero On Tour Decades, and of course we'll have music from the 80s and all sorts of other genres.

366
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:37,000
They've got Modern Music, which includes Dirty Little Secret by the All-American Rejects, Crush Crush Crush by Paramore,

367
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
The Takeover, The Break's Over from Fall Out Boy, and The Pretender from Foo Fighters and Smashing Pumpkins with Tarantula.

368
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And then they also have the 2000s with Linkin Park One Step Closer, Can't Stop by Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Middle with Jimmy Eat World,

369
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and I Can't Believe in Things Called Love by The Darkness and many more.

370
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So they're going to basically have different decades to go along with all this.

371
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Pretty much the game is going to be exactly like Guitar Hero On Tour.

372
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,000
They've just kind of tweaked a few things, including where they'd have you sign autographs and sign different things,

373
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
signing wristbands and stuff like that.

374
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I don't know, it's more of the same, just different track list.

375
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Much like all the music games.

376
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Much like all the other Guitar Hero games have been lately.

377
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That's why they need to add new peripherals, because they're starting to feel like the same damn game over and over again.

378
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah, that's what it is. I don't know.

379
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You know, this isn't our show world, but I heard rumors also that, or I should say I read rumors,

380
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
that they were talking about doing yet another peripheral for a Tony Hawk game on the DS.

381
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Seriously, stop making on the DS?

382
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Like a fingerboard?

383
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Possibly a fingerboard, or possibly, they were suggesting that maybe it's like,

384
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
there was that mag game that they had where you basically would slide the DS around, kind of like a motion sensor almost.

385
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Interesting.

386
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I don't know, it's still retarded though. Stop releasing games with peripherals.

387
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Do you guys remember those fingerboards from back in the day?

388
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Like when I was in high school, they actually had those little things on keychains,

389
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and you actually used your fingers to move this little thing around.

390
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You did little tricks, like they had little miniature ramps.

391
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I remember you having one of those.

392
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Years and years ago, yeah.

393
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
When we were first hanging out.

394
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah, because I thought they were funny.

395
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That dates back to like the early 90s when those things started, I don't know.

396
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Anyhow, sorry, it just made me think of that whole talk about a Tony Hawk peripheral.

397
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Anyhow, going back to music games for a minute, and of course going way back to a series that has been going on for a long, long time,

398
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
it is still going. Dance Dance Revolution has some new games coming out,

399
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and the DDR community over at DDROnlineCommunity.com, the official Dance Dance Revolution community,

400
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
has released some teasers for the upcoming songs for their new games, such as Dance Dance Revolution X.

401
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
That's the new game that's coming out on the Playstation 2 a little later this year,

402
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and they have announced some of the songs in the game.

403
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Big Girls Don't Cry, it's just a cover, so it's a more dancey version of the old Fergie classic.

404
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You Can't Touch This by MC Hammer, that would be the original, is going to be in there.

405
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But of note, brand new remixes, 2008 X edits of Butterfly and Dubby Dub.

406
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Remember Dubby Dub, or you would probably know this as...

407
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So they're basically just re-cutting the song, it doesn't look like a remix, they're just taking a different portion.

408
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Well it says, enjoy the familiar, impossible to resist melody while exploring the fresh new arrangement.

409
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's been reworked exclusively for DDRX.

410
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That's coming with some new Konami originals as well, lots of new Konami originals.

411
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
If you want to see the entire list of the 33 songs, you can check that out at ddronlinecommunity.com.

412
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
They've also released some of the songs that are going to be in DDR Hottest Party 2, that's the Wii version of DDR.

413
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Remember the Wii version of DDR does things a little differently, they do all covers.

414
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And so like there's Umbrella, you knew that had to be in there, the Rihanna classic, during the cover of that.

415
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Black and White by Michael Jackson, Tootsie Roll, that song's awesome.

416
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I Want Candy, Bust a Move, Obsession, I thought that was kind of interesting, the old synth pop song you still hear at goth clubs till today.

417
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Call on Me, but this one I thought was most interesting, Nelly Furtado's All Good Things Come to an End.

418
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
They've remade that as a dance classic, but then again if they can do that to Lips of an Angel, why not do it to that song too.

419
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That's DDR Hottest Party 2 coming to the Nintendo Wii a little later this year.

420
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,000
There was one of those tracks on DDRX, I'm not going to say what it was, number 4, that song was awesome.

421
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It's an awesome remix of another song from DDR.

422
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Also I was going to mention though, this is a cool title for a song, the 30 lives up up down dance mix, that's awesome.

423
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That is a pretty good name for a dinner song.

424
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
DDROnlineCommunity.com if you want to see a list of songs coming to your DDR games later this year.

425
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And I'm sure it's just a matter of time before we start talking about Universe 3, and who knows what else in the DDR franchise on into 2009.

426
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Well how about something that is a little on the different end going into the Sega world, because this is super super happy.

427
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Well, Samba de Amigo is going to be actually coming out on the Wii. Did we know this?

428
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
We did know this.

429
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
But the other good thing about it is that they are actually talking about download content.

430
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So with that, the Wii exclusive track list, if you are ready for this.

431
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Sure.

432
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We have Baila Mae via Gypsy Kings and I Love Gypsy Kings. They do a really good cover of Hotel California.

433
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Papa loves Mambo, Mambo number 8, sorry.

434
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Conga, Miami Sound Machine.

435
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Lowrider, Mambo number 5.

436
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Okay, I really have very little idea how to pronounce just about anything in Spanish.

437
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Oye Como Va by Santana.

438
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Just a bunch of stuff.

439
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So there is actually a Jennifer Lopez song on here too, which I am like meh about.

440
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:43,000
There are some previously returning tracks like Tubthumping, The Cup of Life, Samba De Janeiro, Bombalayo, Take On Me the Real Big Fish version, Tequila, Soul Bossa Nova.

441
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Downloadable tracks are with Mambo Mambo and I Want Candy and Are You Going to Be My Girl.

442
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
That's cool that some of the songs from the old school Samba De Amigo or Coming Back like the Real Big Fish Take On Me.

443
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I seem to remember that was in the Dreamcast. That was the download song on the Dreamcast.

444
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Although they weren't really downloads. They were pay to unlock. Well no, they weren't pay. You didn't have to pay back then.

445
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
They were download.

446
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,000
They were download to unlock. Which though that does give me this bad feeling especially because we're talking about the Wii here. Is this going to be pay to unlock content?

447
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's supposedly not pay to unlock content.

448
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Oh that would be good.

449
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Now this is what's cool. The maracas controller are going to be that bright hot red.

450
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:39,000
One of them has a nunchuck attachment inside and the other one is for your wiimote attachment. I'll be putting a picture of this up on the chatroom.

451
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
chat.ownerslaunchedrader.com

452
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And everybody say a big thank you to Sega for giving us the maracas controller so this game feels right.

453
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Thank you Sega.

454
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It wasn't Sega. I don't think they're licensed.

455
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
They're not licensed by Nintendo or something.

456
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Well still, somebody got it out there one way or another. I hope they make the little shakey shake noise.

457
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I think they do.

458
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Awesome. And this game better still make you pose.

459
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Posing is the best part. But you know what? We still need the tambourine game too.

460
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I know. This needs to sell a million zillion copies so that we can get the tambourine game next. Because we never even got that on the Dreamcast.

461
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But you know I'm all about the tambourine. There's that giant A button. You can press that to do a little slapping thing.

462
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We've got to get the tambourine game here in the US.

463
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,000
In fact, if we have a chance to talk to Sega at Penny Arcade Expo next week, that's the one question I want to ask. Where's the tambourine game?

464
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I talked to Sega.

465
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'll talk to Sega. We want the tambourine game.

466
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Well let's all bug them.

467
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I got to say because we had our games conference at work not last week but the week before last.

468
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And I got to say Sega's lineup was probably one of the coolest lineups I've seen. They actually kind of get it. Which is surprising.

469
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Is that because there's been a couple years where they have not been getting it?

470
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I guess. Well it's not just Sonic stuff. They're putting out stuff. Like they're taking risks I guess.

471
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
With like Mad World, the House of Dead game that's coming out and stuff like that.

472
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Everybody's got to be picky in chat. SSG100Matt says, I will not say thank you to Sega until Shenmue 3 comes out.

473
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Hold your breath?

474
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I want it to come out too, but don't hold your breath.

475
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Act Deaf calls what happened this week at your work the Loki Zig games convention.

476
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Yeah it wasn't very exciting. I got to see people act like idiots so that was fun.

477
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Alright how about some release dates Loki? Let's travel the world and look at release dates from around the world.

478
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Alright this week we've got quite a bit of stuff coming out actually. Some good stuff.

479
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Starting off we've got Commando Steel Disaster on the DS. Now this game might not sound familiar to you guys.

480
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But it plays exactly like Metal Slug. And it looks kind of like Metal Slug.

481
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So definitely check it out if you're into the fast shooter games like Contra, Metal Slug. Worth checking out.

482
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So that's on the DS. Also on the DS MLB Power Pros 2008, Konami's super deformed baseball game.

483
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Nintendo, not to be outdone by Konami, is putting out Mario Super Sluggers on the Wii.

484
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Funnel family baseball game.

485
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:42,000
On pretty much all systems, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09. That's coming out on Playstation 2, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and the PSP.

486
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
On the PS3 we have Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice.

487
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli on Playstation 2, PS3, Wii, and the DS.

488
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Vampire Rain Altered Species on Playstation 3. In case you forgot, this game really sucked on the Xbox 360 just so you know.

489
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Picto Image on the DS, Kid Sports Crazy Golf by Destineer, which is a company only known for great games.

490
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Oh wait, that's right. All their games are shovelware. Much like this game.

491
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:35,000
GTR Evolution on the PC, Pajama Sam Don't Fear the Dark on the Wii, and Freddy Fish in the Kelp Seed Mystery on the Wii.

492
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And Spy Fox in Dry... That sounds like fun, Freddy Fish in the Kelp Mystery.

493
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And Spy Fox in Dry Cereal on the Wii, all of which are meant for little kids.

494
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Wait, what? Spy Fox in Dry Cereal.

495
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Nice. You know, like the episode's called Dry Cereal.

496
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Alright, some guy kidnapped the milk.

497
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Let's travel the world.

498
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Whoa whoa whoa, I'm not done yet!

499
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Damn, there's a lot coming out this week after weeks of nothing.

500
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yes, Tales of Vesperia on Xbox 360, N Plus on PSP and DS, From the Abyss on DS, Harvest Moon Island of Happiness on the DS, Digimon World Championship on the DS, Sims 2 Apartment Pets on the DS, Falling Stars on the Playstation 2,

501
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Um, Penumbra Requiem on PC, Prison Tycoon 4 Super Max on PC, The Sims Apartment Life on DS and PC.

502
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I think that's only on the PC because the DS is something different.

503
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And let's see, Garfield Fun Fest on the DS, Sid Meier's Pirates on the Mac.

504
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Sounds like fun.

505
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Ford Racing Offroad on the Wii, Hacker Evolution Reinsertion on PC.

506
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
That's the worst subtitle ever.

507
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And Project Powder on PC, and that's not a good follow.

508
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Project Powder? Is that based on the movie from like ten years ago?

509
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I can only hope.

510
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:23,000
James Pond, Codename Robocod, my god these are all horrible names on the DS, Mind Habits on the Mac, Flat Out Ultimate Carnage on PC, and Operation Mania on PC.

511
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Do you think Tales of Vesperia will be as big here as it was over in Japan?

512
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Because I don't know if you've heard, but it's been selling like crazy over in Japan.

513
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's been pushing 360 units out the door.

514
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I know, that's crazy.

515
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That's one of the big stories we missed by not being here last week.

516
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
No, I don't think it's going to do us well because Infinino Discovery is coming out next week.

517
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Oh snap.

518
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Alright, well speaking of Japan.

519
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And Mercenaries 2, where the hell is Mercenaries 2?

520
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Jesus Christ, are we done with the USA?

521
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
No, Mercenaries 2, it's coming out on PC, PlayStation 2, PS3, and Xbox 360.

522
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Next time just go, a bunch of shit, a bunch of shit is coming out in the US.

523
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Hey, I have to inform them what's coming out.

524
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Alright.

525
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Are you done? Are we finally done?

526
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Amanda, Steel Disaster picked it up on DS.

527
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
That's all, I'm done.

528
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Are you sure? Are you sure? Alright, I'm finished.

529
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Moving over to Japan, if I can.

530
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
We've been talking about the release dates over there on the Xbox 360.

531
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
2 Human finally makes its way to Japan on August 28th.

532
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Also coming out, Clannad is coming out in Japan on the Xbox 360.

533
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
This is not to be confused with the Irish music group.

534
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I think Enya's sister is in Clannad.

535
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Yes.

536
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Because Enya was once in the band.

537
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Clannad is also a Japanese manga.

538
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So this is coming out on 360, they're making a game of it.

539
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So that sounds exciting.

540
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Although I don't know, an Enya game might be kind of exciting too.

541
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
On the PlayStation 3, guess what Japan is getting this week?

542
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Africa comes out finally on the PlayStation 3 this week.

543
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Oh, Loki has that look on his face of maybe I should import that.

544
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Alright, Battlefield Bad Company and Disgaea 3, but the English language version comes out.

545
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It's all Asia regions. Sometimes some Asian dates sneak on my list too.

546
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So Disgaea 3 is something to look forward to.

547
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii over in Japan.

548
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You ready for it? Captain Rainbow on August 28th.

549
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh yeah.

550
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
You need to import that shit, Loki. Get that game instead.

551
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Alright, on the PlayStation 2, lots of games coming out.

552
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Another Mahjong game, Mahjong Sangokushi coming out.

553
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:35,000
As well as Yotsuno, a Journey of Sincerity comes out from Gadgetsoft on the 28th.

554
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Nariai Ring Cross Bongol Returns comes out on the PlayStation 2 as well.

555
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yes, it's a baseball game.

556
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Moving on to the handheld, seeing what's coming out over there.

557
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
We've got on the Nintendo DS, Johnny no Dasutsu Daisukusen.

558
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And just because it would not be a week in Japanese release dates without something coming to us from Broccoli known as Neon Genesis Evangelion.

559
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
More Eva!

560
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
This time, Ayanami Ikusei Kyaku DS with Asuka, Hokkan Kyaku.

561
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Okay, what about Rei and Asuka?

562
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I don't know, I'm looking at the more details on this game.

563
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Rei is the character I hate, Ayanami.

564
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And Asuka's the awesome one that speaks German.

565
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
There you have it, another DS game coming out there.

566
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Tactical Guild also coming out and To Love, Rue Trouble comes out from Marvelous as well.

567
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Quickly taking a look at the PSP to see if there's anything of note to mention to you guys.

568
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Fate Tiger Coliseum Upper is the only game coming out.

569
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
There you go.

570
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That's your week in Japanese release dates.

571
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Well how about our European release dates?

572
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
We've got a bunch, they're all the 29th.

573
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
GTR Evolution, that's on PC.

574
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We have Driving Theory Training, I guess so you learn how to drive in theory from Atari.

575
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Ferrari Challenge on Wii, Legend of Sayuki, Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution on DS, Smash Court Tennis 3, Soul Calibur Legends on Wii, Super Swing Golf, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 on a bunch of systems, and Two Human on Xbox 360.

576
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Sweet. Busy week around the world. Crazy stuff.

577
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Alright, and we've got some quick mentions with more release dates, not stuff coming out soon, but soon enough I guess, among other things.

578
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Fallout 3 was announced this week that it will be coming out on October 28th on PlayStation 3 and on the Xbox 360 as well as the Special Edition.

579
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And that should be as big as Oblivion, if not bigger.

580
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
This week on Hot Shots Golf, there was Kratos download content.

581
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You can actually play as the God of War using, I'm trying to remember what the blades were, the Clubs of Chaos in the golf game. I guess that's cute.

582
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Silent Hill Homecoming.

583
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
How much are they going to whore that guy out, seriously?

584
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Forever.

585
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Silent Hill Homecoming was kind of in question whether it's going to be still coming out in September, since the European version was delayed a bit.

586
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
It is still set for September in North America, and the PC version will be coming out as well.

587
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:49,000
It will only be available on Steam, however, and if I remember correctly, Silent Hill Homecoming is just barely in September. I think it's on the 30th if I remember correctly.

588
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And then Nintendo, there's some Nintendo stuff announced, or maybe not announced.

589
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Wii Music, slated for October 27th. I can't imagine that's a really good date to release that, but more power to them, I guess.

590
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Pokemon Ranger Shadows of Almia on the 10th of November, and Animal Crossing City Folk on the 16th of November, along with the Wii Speak speaker, conference room, mic, whatever you want to call it.

591
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Although, what you may not know, despite what they announced at E3, it will not be coming with the Wii Speak microphone. You will have to buy that separately, and the microphone will cost you $29.99.

592
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Is that a secret? I have not heard that. This is like the first time I'm hearing this.

593
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Well, that's because no one knows about it yet.

594
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Interesting, alright. Well, that's too bad.

595
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You know, from a retail standpoint, that's good because then there won't be shortages on the game, but...

596
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I guess that's true.

597
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Alright, well, thanks for the updates, Loki.

598
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
AlphaCananagram says it was already known, I think, so who knows.

599
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Well, here's one game that people are definitely anticipating, Final Fantasy XIII, and the question is, when is the demo coming?

600
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And you might have heard that there is a demo coming, I think we talked about it a couple of weeks ago.

601
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It's coming with the Final Fantasy Advent Children Blu-Ray release, the complete version, which has the extra footage.

602
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Well, here's the interesting thing, it's being reported by IGN that apparently in Famitsu PS3 edition, apparently the director of Final Fantasy XIII, Motomu Toriyama, has said that it's going to be a two-hour demo.

603
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:55,000
So, that's a heck of a lot of demo. He says, quote, like the Final Fantasy VII demo that was included with PlayStation's Tow Ball number one, it will be similar to that, it will allow folks to experience the opening sequence and prologue.

604
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:07,000
So that could be pretty interesting. They're trying to accomplish with this demo, get people acquainted with the party system, seeing the game through multiple characters, points of view, and you will actually be controlling more than one character in the demo.

605
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Apparently, in Final Fantasy XIII, there is no central character. You will be controlling one character after another in classic Final Fantasy form. So that could be interesting.

606
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So I'm very curious to see what this demo looks like. I'm not surprised they're saying it's two hours, but I still think there's people that are going to blast right through it, but it's probably one of those things where there might be a lot of hidden depth to it, and you can milk two hours out of it, but I imagine most people will burn through it in an hour.

607
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
But we'll see. I know I will definitely be getting this demo.

608
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I will be importing this bitch.

609
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:50,000
You should import that bitch. I want to see this demo, although there will be YouTubes all over, I still don't see it on a high def TV, and you just can't get that on YouTube.

610
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Well, we at least would know people that would do it anyway.

611
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Sure, true. Well, for people who are fans of Street Fighter IV, that is actually, I do believe, just recently had a console version announced.

612
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:18,000
There is going to be Kami in the game, so she will be included in the console release of Street Fighter IV, and that makes people happy because they like to see her butt crack.

613
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Who doesn't?

614
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
No answer.

615
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
No answer.

616
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Alright.

617
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So, totally unrelated to Kami and butt crack, well actually this is kind of funny.

618
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:45,000
The PlayStation 3 will be getting a wireless keypad with mouse input, and I guess the way it kind of relates to butt crack is it sort of looks like a COD piece.

619
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:55,000
But, I don't understand where the mouse input is coming from because I don't see any sort of touchpad or anything, unless they're having you rub your fingers over the letters, I don't know.

620
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But, yeah, it's kind of interesting, kind of cool, and it snaps to the joystick much like, I don't know, the chatpad, but this time instead of being below the actual controller, it's above it.

621
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
So, that's kind of neat.

622
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And other things that it will feature, quick keys for your friends lists and for your messages, as well as the ability to type and all that fun stuff.

623
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Very interesting that the PS3 has been compared a lot of times to a computer, and even have a lot of games that have these PC boards, and now they're giving mouse inputs on there.

624
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I think it's awesome, I mean it has a web browser.

625
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It's not a bad thing.

626
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It has a web browser, I mean, that would be useful.

627
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You know what would also be useful to have a keyboard? The PSP! Seriously folks, where the fuck is the PSP keyboard?

628
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
ActDeft in chat says, Sony, we don't innovate, we imitate.

629
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I always thought that was kind of Microsoft's thing, is that, you know, anything you can do, I can do better, remember that?

630
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
But that's innovating.

631
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I guess that's true, when you make it better.

632
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Yeah, Sony has been playing a lot of catch up though, you know, but I don't know, this mouse thing is kind of neat, I guess.

633
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Now this is good though, what better on the PlayStation 3 than something free?

634
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And we like free things, the only bad news for us is that it's happening in Europe.

635
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Oh well, we still have some friends overseas that listen to our show.

636
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Guess what, you guys are getting something called vidzone.

637
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
It's something for the PS3 that involves music videos.

638
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It's a streaming music video service that's going to be launching on the PlayStation 3.

639
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
The trial of this whole thing is supposed to be starting in early 2009.

640
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It's going to be taking place in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

641
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,000
What the vidzone will include, a full playlist of videos from hip hop to punk, heavy metal, and classics.

642
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And you'll actually be able to build your own playlist, you can download songs and music videos and ringtones, but some of that might actually end up costing you.

643
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:05,000
So while I guess it'll probably be free to maybe watch some of the videos on demand and stuff, if you actually want to take away the ringtones or download the songs, that's going to cost you a little bit of money.

644
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
By the way though, now this is kind of cool, it will do the whole remote play thing.

645
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So if you download a music video, you can put it on your PSP.

646
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So if there's a music video that you just have to have with you on the go, you can do that.

647
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And that's one of Sony's strengths right now, is that they've built a really good relationship between the PS3 and the PSP for those that own both.

648
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
So that does sound kind of cool, I've got to admit.

649
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I mean how neat would it be to say, oh there's this great new song, oh wait you haven't heard it? Oh here, I got it on my PSP.

650
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Kind of neat. So props to them for that, really.

651
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I can do that, I have an iPhone.

652
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Touché.

653
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Well, in other, this has just been exactly like you said, a music loaded, you know.

654
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:59,000
It really has, it's a music filled show tonight, and it's not just because we love music games based on our history, but it really has been dominating the news this week.

655
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
But consider how much music games are selling these days, between Guitar Hero, Rock Band and all that, it's big business now.

656
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Whereas we were nerds back in the day for playing them.

657
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Well, still. There actually was an announcement at Leipzig that was said that there is going to be a SingStar songs that, let me start over.

658
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:35,000
There are, it says over 2.2 million SingStar songs were downloaded from the SingStore that launched about a year ago.

659
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So now there's actually new plans for a Disney version for PS2 that's all Disney songs.

660
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And you know, there was a rumor about this a while back, and I called bullshit on it, because I thought Disney would do it themselves.

661
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
They are doing it themselves.

662
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Well there's more.

663
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Okay, go ahead, sorry.

664
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It's exclusively for PAL territories.

665
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Exactly, because in the North American territories, and possibly Japan, I don't know.

666
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:16,000
But it's compatible with the SingStar PS3, and of course if you have an HDTV it won't matter if it's PAL or not.

667
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Loki, it's not just because SingStar performs better in Europe?

668
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah, it does perform better in Europe, but in the US, or North America I should say, they are releasing Disney's Sing It.

669
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Which is basically like SingStar, but it's all the Disney songs, and you know, they're kind of a version of a karaoke game.

670
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Now something that did make our show roll tonight, but apparently there's a SingStar queen on the way too.

671
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Like the band, Queen?

672
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I would be so all over that.

673
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Yeah, exactly.

674
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I actually like SingStar better than Karaoke Revolution.

675
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
They both have their strengths and weaknesses to me.

676
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I think Karaoke Revolution is a better game as a package, but I think SingStar has the better music overall.

677
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Lips though, I have really high hopes for Lips. I think it's going to take what's great from both games, honestly.

678
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Well what's kind of cool also, I was going to say, there's another announcement that they're going to do a patch for SingStar PS3 where you can use your PlayStation 2 disc to import songs from that as well.

679
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Like you can with the PlayStation 2 version.

680
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Good! I think that's a great idea. Good for them.

681
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Something else that's kind of neat, and no, I was reading in the chat room, well actually that was for Africa, but no more games are going to get added on to the bet.

682
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So you can forget about it.

683
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And this is another game that will not be added on to the bet, but it also uses the PlayStation Eye.

684
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It's Eye Pet.

685
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It's basically a game where you prod what looks to be a little monkey creature.

686
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And to be honest, it is very cute looking.

687
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And if I didn't have a TV that was, you know, kind of with a plastic screen, you know, an LCD TV, I would let my cat play with this.

688
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But yeah, so it's a virtual pet.

689
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And you get the Poked.

690
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And it's coming out in 2009.

691
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Oh goody. Just what the world needs.

692
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
More virtual pets.

693
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:30,000
They'll probably have, well this is kind of cool because you can like pick it up and stuff, or pretend to pick it up and throw it around.

694
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Alright, well one more story for you guys before we get to the end of part A in the Classic Game of the Week.

695
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And it's more music games.

696
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I mean we just had a lot to talk about tonight, and the question is, what's Harmonix going to do next?

697
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I mean, you know, they've obviously had mega success with Rock Band.

698
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:54,000
The rumor is that apparently Harmonix is dealing in the new game that has to do with music creation.

699
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
It's something that their PR rep John Drake said, talking to MTV's multiplayer blog.

700
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
We've done the whole MIDI creation thing.

701
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
We think we can do something really ambitious and really great that's going to speak across all the users of the game, not just hardcore users.

702
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And that will result in some awesome stuff and not just Final Fantasy covers.

703
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So, interesting that Harmonix might get into a little more of the creation.

704
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
You know, Harmonix has put out a lot of solid products.

705
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I assume if they're going to go this way, it's going to be some pretty good stuff.

706
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I look forward to their next project, and I hope it's just not, you know, Rock Band 3, Rock Band 4, Rock Band 5, you know what I mean?

707
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I'm looking forward to new, original things they come out with. Wouldn't you agree?

708
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Yes. You know, um, that's right. What, Loki? I was going to say, kind of going back to the last story that we had.

709
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I was checking out the trailer for that iPad. It actually looks really cute, actually.

710
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by it.

711
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I'm surprised to hear you describing a game as cute. What makes it so cute?

712
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Well, the creature is incredibly fuzzy and cute. It kind of looks like a little miniature monkey Simba.

713
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Anyways, what's kind of neat, though, is some of the technology that they're using with it, you can draw your pet toys.

714
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So, basically, you draw a little car, and it becomes a car.

715
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
It's kind of like some of those tech demos they were showing off using the PlayStation Eye.

716
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:25,000
That's the kind of thing with the PlayStation Eye. They're actually doing some really cool things with it, unlike the Eye toy, which is just a lot of crap.

717
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:34,000
So, I'm kind of excited to see what they're going to do with this, and I may actually have to pick up this game, just because my cat would love playing with this thing.

718
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That's why.

719
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Alright. Sounds good.

720
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Alright, well, we've got one more bit for you guys here before we go to a break, and that is the Classic Game of the Week.

721
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:57,000
That's right. Every week, Dark Sakura goes to the archives and finds a game suitable for all of you out there in Orange Lawn's radio podcast land to check out and play.

722
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And she's got a good one for you tonight. It's going to be one of those games where you're like, oh, she hasn't done this game yet. Amazing.

723
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
So, Dark Sakura, what should the kids be playing this week?

724
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:16,000
The game of the week is Jet Set Radio, which is one of my all-time favorite games.

725
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Let's have some music, shall we, Rob?

726
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Working on it.

727
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Okay. Well, at any rate, Jet Set Radio is a game where you start off as this guy named Beat who is a runaway who got shoved from gang to gang until he decided to make one of his own, and they basically just go around tagging shit.

728
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
That's really the purpose of the game, is to tag stuff and wipe out your opposition.

729
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And it's got some good music in it. We've got some Guitar Vader, which I like Guitar Vader.

730
01:08:46,000 --> 01:09:09,000
In the U.S. version, there was a track by Mixmaster Mike and by, actually Dragula was in it, Rob Zombie. And there were a few that were only in the PAL release, too, such as, let's see, some of the groups was Semi Detached and Jurassic Five.

731
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:18,000
In the Japanese version, there was one by David Soul. So each release had its own stuff. Let's play some music.

732
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
This game really was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed this game when they were in gas.

733
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Well, at any rate, the way that you go through the game is that you've got basically rollerblades, and you pick up different people in the game to bring them into your own little gang of Rudy's, they're called.

734
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Like, the main guy, Beat, is very, you know, all around, you know, even. He's very balanced.

735
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:06,000
But you get another guy later, I don't remember his name, he was the guy who had the big boom box. He was really slow and really tough, so you could use him for, like, endurance.

736
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:15,000
But as the game goes through, you know, the police come after you and you have to knock them over, and you can actually tag the head detective who comes after you.

737
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,000
But in later stages, like, they send out helicopters to shoot you down and all kinds of stuff. It's crazy.

738
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And then the last level is you're fighting this guy on top of a giant record album who's trying to use the album to summon a demon, but that won't ruin that for anybody.

739
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
But there were other releases after this first coin came out.

740
01:10:35,000 --> 01:11:01,000
By the way, the Jet Set Radio thing is, actually, this Professor K is a DJ in a pirate radio station in the city of Tokyo-cho. There's also different areas in the game that represent a different time of day, like Shibuya-cho is daytime, Benten-cho is nighttime, and Kogane-cho is, like, a residential area at sunset. That's pretty cool.

741
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:12,000
But you've also got your rival gangs in there. There is the Poison Jam that wear fish costumes. They're kind of stupid.

742
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:21,000
The Noise Tanks are cyborg types, and Love Shockers are a girl game that look like the emo rangers, which I thought was funny.

743
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And then you have to fight the Golden Rhinos later. The other versions that I was talking about is there was a Jet Set Radio Future that came out on Xbox, and we got it in America as JSRF, Jet Set Radio Future.

744
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:44,000
It came out in Europe, too. Basically, it was just a bit more touched up, you know, had different music.

745
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Jet Set Radio came out on Game Boy Advance that was from an isometric perspective. It was alright, you know, it was cute.

746
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Then there was actually one that was actually released called De La Jet Set Radio, which was the deluxe version, that was only in Japan via Dreamcast Direct.

747
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:21,000
It later came out of Sega Direct. So it's really hard to get a hold of, but you actually could download it in Europe.

748
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
You could actually set it for English, and the text of the game would be in English, but all the voices were in Japanese.

749
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,000
But it was also in German, French, and Spanish, too. So if anyone's got that, I'd like to see it.

750
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And then a headstrong game actually talked to Sega about making Jet Set Radio Wii, and Sega's like, nuh-uh.

751
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Bastards! That would be so great! Or especially with all the Dreamcast love we've seen on Xbox Live Arcade lately, what with Soul Calibur and some of these games.

752
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I would love to see Jet Set Radio take a new form on Xbox Live Arcade or something, you know what I mean? Don't let this franchise rot away.

753
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Well, the other thing that I also didn't mention is that, as much as I hate the name, we did get our first release in America as Jet Grind Radio.

754
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So I don't know why I think maybe someone else had licensed Jet Set Radio or something. It was stupid, so now they fixed it for later versions.

755
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Alright, well there you have it, your classic game of the week. Jet Set Radio or Jet Grind Radio, whatever you prefer.

756
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Just go do some graffiti, but not in real life. Strictly for the games.

757
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Oh, the other thing about that, you actually had a graffiti editor.

758
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
That's right, I remember that.

759
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
So I thought that was pretty cool.

760
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:48,000
See, that's why they need it. Imagine, with download content and everything, we could have OLR gang signs that you could use as graffiti. Alright, there you have it.

761
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
A very excellent classic game of the week. True, true classic there.

762
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Alright, we are going to take a break, but fear not, we'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

763
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:07,000
For those of you on the podcast, you'll just hear some quick not-commercials, because there are promos for other podcasts or other commercials for things going on out in the world that is completely free.

764
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
So we call it a free break. We're going to take a free break and we'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

765
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
For those of you guys listening live to us, though, on AllGames.com as we do tape live on Sunday nights, you'll hear some music.

766
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Just a quick couple of songs and then some free break and we'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio Part B.

767
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Lots of stuff to come. Rumors abound about the 360 and this apparent price drop that's coming and if Microsoft's going to be taking some cues from Nintendo and what have you.

768
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:39,000
And then, by the way, something a lot of our listeners call in to talk about, canned, not happening this year.

769
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
We're going to talk about all that in Part B when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

770
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:57,000
So you've got a bunch of websites and podcasts about anime, manga, or video games, but you just don't have the time to read and listen to them all.

771
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
When are you actually going to find the time to play games or watch anime?

772
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:12,000
That's why there's Antigamers. Not only are we a comprehensive anime, manga, and video game blog with news and reviews, but we've also got a podcast.

773
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Tune in to hear our insightful conversation about your favorite geeky topics. We do news, reviews, con reports, debates, and even reporting convention panels.

774
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Plus, you can expect something different from the Antigamers podcast every time.

775
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
That's because we always bring in new co-hosts, including our own staff, other podcasters, and industry insiders.

776
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:40,000
To subscribe, visit www.antigamers.com or search for us in the iTunes store.

777
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:50,000
The Antigamers podcast. Because we all need another anime and gaming podcast. Right?

778
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts from OLR here. You know, I hate it when people come up to me and tell me I just lost the game.

779
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I can't help but think to myself, what game? I'm not playing any video games right this second. Or I don't remember signing up to play Monopoly.

780
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Apparently it's some stupid internet joke where if I think about the game, I lose the game.

781
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
You know, next time some kid tells me I just lost the game, I'm gonna tell them that they just lost their balance.

782
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Then when they look at me like a puppy dog and say, what? I'll kick them in the shin. Then I'll point and laugh. Because I'm not playing your fucking stupid game.

783
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Can't make it to this year's Penny Arcade Expo? All Games Radio has you covered.

784
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,000
We're totally excited. I was at PAX last year when we announced that we were doing the game, and this is like twice as big. It's just unbelievably amazing.

785
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:51,000
For three days, All Games Radio will bring you a total of eight hours of live coverage from the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle.

786
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I hear ninjas take away five durability points.

787
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
You know, I haven't run into a ninja in the burning scene, but if they mythically did exist, I suspect they would take away five durability points.

788
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Oh, they do exist. They're coming for you.

789
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Come join Bobby Blackwolf along with some of your favorite All Games Radio personalities live as they talk about the games and the gamers at the show.

790
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
It is the freaking Voltron of independent podcasting.

791
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Participating shows include Dead Pixel Live, Super Happy Funtime Show, Orange Lounge Radio, Under Sedation Live, Electric Sisterhood, Game Addict Hotline, Chatterbox Video Game Radio, Evil Avatar Radio.

792
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Our trip to PAX has turned into a very interesting journey.

793
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:35,000
It could be the best trip of all time, or it has quite a few opportunities to go wrong on a lot of different levels.

794
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Coverage begins at 7 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Pacific on August 29th, 30th, and 31st, and you can join us either on All Games Radio at allgames.com or be a part of our live audience in one of the Sumo Lounges near Tabletop Gaming.

795
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
It just kind of feels like, yeah, these are my folks. This is our people. You kind of walk in and say, yeah, I feel like I'm home.

796
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
All Games Radio presents PAX08 Live. You won't want to miss this.

797
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Music

798
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

799
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Moochawky.

800
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

801
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
PAXCon.

802
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

803
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I am so freaking excited about PAX. Can't get here any sooner.

804
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
But it's only a few days away from tonight.

805
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Just to clarify, gang, some folks in the chat were asking, there will be no live Orange Lounge Radio on All Games next week, because it's 6 o'clock Pacific.

806
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:49,000
That's right when things are going to be wrapping up with the live PAX coverage, and Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki will be on a plane ride, so we can't do all our live next week.

807
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But for those of you that listen on the podcast, which I hope all of you that listen live are still subscribed to our podcast feed,

808
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:04,000
we will be producing some shows that will go directly there from our hotel room, as well as participating in the Penny Arcade coverage that you heard there during the free break on AllGames.com.

809
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
And that's available if you want more information on that.

810
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:20,000
pax.allgames.com has all the information you need to know about that. And by the way, I love that ad. I love the fact that they have a guy in a radio voice going, and joining them is Super Happy Funtime Show.

811
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Some of those other awesomely named podcasts that we're going to be attending with.

812
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news. Loki, what's this about the price drop? Is it happening?

813
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Probably. Where there's smoke, there's fire, and there's Xbox 360 price drops.

814
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Well, you remember back a few weeks ago that there was a rumor that the Xbox 360 would be dropping in price on all three SKUs, including the recently introduced 60GB Pro system.

815
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Well, if the rumor is true, then on September 7th, the arcade will be dropping to $1.99, the Pro system, the 60GB, will be dropping to $2.99, and the Elite to $3.99.

816
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And there's a little bit more proof that it will probably happen, because guess what? Just like all those other price drops that have ever happened, there have been some ads leaked.

817
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:30,000
And wouldn't you know it, Radio Shack is listing the Elite for $3.99, and the arcade for $1.99, and the ad says it's good starting September 7th.

818
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Damn you Radio Shack, for ruining it all.

819
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,000
So, you know, sure we could go and say that this is all rumor and stuff, but come on.

820
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I mean, I'm not going to insult your intelligence. Of course there's going to be a fucking price drop happening.

821
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,000
The same thing happens every time there's a price drop or new SKU introduced that's always leaked out by these stupid ads.

822
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:59,000
And, well, what can I tell you? Just going to have to wait a couple more Sundays and we'll see.

823
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Do you think maybe next time they should take a different approach and not tell retailers until the day they're ready to do it?

824
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
They can't, because they have to set up their advertising that way and co-op and stuff.

825
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:16,000
So there's really no way to do it other than punish the people leaking the stuff out.

826
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
It's too hard though, it could be anybody.

827
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It's probably a small list of people, but I don't know.

828
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I think what's interesting though is you've got a few things happening.

829
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:42,000
One, they've dropped their system down now to match what the Playstation 3 is kind of doing with their Elite system that has 120GB of hard drive space.

830
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And it's priced the same as the soon to be introduced 80GB core system from Sony's PS3 line there.

831
01:21:52,000 --> 01:22:03,000
And also the arcade system, which there's some info on that too coming later, priced lower than the Wii.

832
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I mean that's kind of interesting right there.

833
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:13,000
If there are Wii shortages during the holiday, people might go, hey, let's buy a 360, it's cheaper.

834
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
That's probably exactly what they want people to do.

835
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Cheaper and easier to find, more games out there.

836
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And now they've got family friendly titles, they're really going to pull out some good game plan, that's all I've got to say.

837
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Alright, well I'm looking at comments in chat here.

838
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Joshi16 says, I may buy an arcade just so I can put an Xbox in another room.

839
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Let's see, Rama says, hey Sony, 360 is getting a price drop, do the same for PS3 you fuckers.

840
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Darktosuius says, my brother keeps bugging me about when's the PS3 coming down.

841
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:55,000
And IkumaJP, our good friend from Japan, agrees with Loki, they can't advertise this stuff in advance.

842
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
But he does say, every time a leak happens, kittens get killed.

843
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
You know the old saying.

844
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Alright, anyhow, you know, Loki mentioned where there's smoke there's fire, but could there be a freaking nuclear bomb?

845
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I don't know about this one, but apparently the arcade skew, coming down to $199 based on what Loki said.

846
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Here it comes again, rumors that there is a motion controller coming with that Xbox 360 arcade this holiday.

847
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Apparently this new arcade system, again this may not necessarily be the one that comes on September 7th,

848
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I would think if it is we would have heard about it a long time ago,

849
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
but possibly one that's coming later on by the holidays,

850
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
says that it's going to come with a 512 megabyte memory card,

851
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and the new Xbox experience is already there on the system so you don't even have to get online to get it,

852
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:49,000
and a motion controller is supposed to be coming with it along with some compatible mini games that have been developed by Rare.

853
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Now here's where it gets weird, apparently this controller is also supposed to be sold separately with even more mini games by Rare.

854
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So I don't know, the controller though is supposedly going to work with any Xbox 360 that's already out there,

855
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
so it's not like you have to get a new Xbox just to have this motion controller.

856
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I don't know, fact or crap? I say it's crap.

857
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:20,000
If it actually does happen, it will have to happen by the end of October.

858
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Because the end of October is when Microsoft has to announce this as Penny Arcade or E4A in other words.

859
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I mean I can't imagine they would just keep it a freaking secret.

860
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
They would want everybody in the whole freaking world to know that this is coming,

861
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:43,000
and I don't know why they'd bother to put out a new SKU to lower the price to $199 unless they're trying to clear the shelves of the existing arcade units.

862
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That's as far as I can believe.

863
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I don't think so, because if they were going to release, if they were going to try to clear off the shelves of arcade units,

864
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
they would have dropped it down to $199 and this would come out at $239 or whatever.

865
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
What's going to happen though is it does have to come out though by the end of October,

866
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
because the end of October is when the new scenic game comes out and it has Avatar support already built in.

867
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,000
So the new firmware update is coming out before that, and if this firmware update is being included on the actual console,

868
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
it has to come out before the end of October.

869
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,000
But still Loki, September 7th, then they're not going to do two SKU things back to back like that.

870
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
But they're going to do this because including the 512 megabyte memory unit makes it on par with Nintendo's system,

871
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and it's cheaper and it has motion controlled stuff.

872
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:37,000
But I just, why would Microsoft not say anything official about this and then drop this on us on September 7th?

873
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Doesn't that seem a little bit far fetched?

874
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Unless they're going to reveal it at Penny Arcade Expo, but I somehow doubt it.

875
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I somehow doubt it too.

876
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I don't know. Price drop probably. Motion controls, I don't know.

877
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Dark Sakura, any interest in motion control on 360 at all?

878
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Not really.

879
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I mean, is it just because maybe it's like, yeah, I've been there, done that at this point?

880
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I hated it on PS3.

881
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Oh, with the whole six axis. Oh true, you always forget about that.

882
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And honestly, I don't really play that many Wii games, you know. I don't really enjoy them as much using the controller that way, so I'm not excited.

883
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Alright, well, we'll see what happens.

884
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
ActDeft in chat says, Microsoft Smart, they will make the arcade have the 20 gigabyte drive.

885
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I don't know, as long as they keep selling that separately, why not?

886
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
But then again, it makes a lot of sense because Microsoft's trying to do a lot more digital distribution.

887
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I don't know. We'll see.

888
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Well, speaking of other Microsoft stuff, there was, at the Leipzig convention, a controller that was almost identical except for being kind of a pukey green color.

889
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:52,000
That had corrected a D-pad. Supposed to be a lot more easy to use, better control on it.

890
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And it was supposed to be, you know, coming out along with Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 and, you know, people were pretty excited about it except that it was stated to be a limited edition promotional item that is going to be out on October 24th.

891
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,000
However, it's as long as supplies last and only available in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.

892
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I think the color of that controller is limited edition. I think if they're going to fix the controller, they're not just going to fix it on some and just say forget it.

893
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I hope you're right, Loki, because I know when I first heard about this news that Darth Sireth was telling us, I was like, why won't they just fix it across the board?

894
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Okay, here's why I know that it's just the colors. Because the colors, the red and that ugly green are coming out. They were announced at E3 because they're coming out as well around the time of Gears of War.

895
01:27:50,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I think it's actually at the end of October also. So if they decide to redesign the controller, those colors will probably be limited edition for a while because they already announced that those were going to be limited.

896
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And then they'll probably just tweak the whole controller because there's no reason to make an entirely different mold and circuit board setup or whatever they have to do for the Xbox 360 controller.

897
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Fix the problem and just say, okay, we're done. No more fixing. They're just going to fix it. Period.

898
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I hope you're right. I would love, you know, although I kind of resent the fact I'm going to have to buy a whole new Xbox 360 controller to fix what was essentially their crappy D-pad, but I'll do it because I mean, I don't know how you guys feel.

899
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I hate that D-pad on the Xbox. I mean, it really does take away from some of those games. I don't know how you guys feel, but I hate it. Do you use that control pad a lot?

900
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I don't really hate it.

901
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I can't stand it. It does not feel nearly as slick as Sony's pad.

902
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
No, that's true, but I never had a problem with it really. Not that much of a problem.

903
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Alright. Well, there you have it.

904
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:03,000
It should be like the Wii D-pad. That'd be awesome. But, you know, we're never going to see it.

905
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Just a little more defined when you push it in different directions. I mean, seriously, playing Soul Calibur or any fighting game with that stinks.

906
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Yeah. So Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts. That's going to be coming out this fall.

907
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And kind of with that is a little bonus. You actually get early access to the Banjo-Kazooie Xbox Live Arcade game release early and you get it for free.

908
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:45,000
So that's pretty awesome. And Banjo-Kazooie, of course, coming out for $40. If I remember correctly, mid-November. That would be like the 17th or 16th? I don't remember.

909
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I don't know. It's kind of neat. Not my game.

910
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Not my thing.

911
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
No, seriously.

912
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
There's tons of Banjo-Kazooie fans out there that I'm sure are very excited about.

913
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
It's not... I don't know. I have to go back and play Cameo.

914
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
You're going to go back and play Cameo?

915
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I think I should.

916
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Why? Just to get the achievement points. Admit it, Loki. That's what you want to do. You want to go back and get the achievement points.

917
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Yeah, I do. But also I want to just play through the game because it was supposed to be pretty cool.

918
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Alright. Also coming out to Xbox Live Arcade some day is a Lode Runner remake. I think we've talked about this on the show before because I seem to remember rumblings of this a while back.

919
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I don't know how many of you remember this old game. It's a real classic game from the 80s personal computing era. They had it on Apple IIe. I had this game on Commodore 64.

920
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Basically it was a very simple game with little sticks. It was kind of like a puzzle slash action game. You play this little stick man who ran around and there were ladders and monkey bars that you could kind of crawl across.

921
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,000
But what you would know this game best for was how you could dig a hole in the bricks and fall through them in a certain strategy.

922
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:01,000
By the way, if you've never played this game before, the TurboGrafx version I believe is on a virtual console. Like there's a version of it that's on any... sorry, Wii's virtual console.

923
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Well apparently an Xbox Live Arcade remake is going on right now and IGN actually found this at the Leipzig show going on that there is a build of the arcade version that apparently is just about done.

924
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Ready to go. So it's coming somewhat soon. Maybe before the holidays. I don't know.

925
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
They've got a lot of good releases coming on Xbox Live Arcade.

926
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,000
You know, I don't know though. I've got to admit, Lode Runner is kind of one of those 80's early games that was a lot of fun back in the day.

927
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
But I think if you played it now, I think the nostalgia would be gone soon unless they've made a lot of updates and changes to it.

928
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:45,000
This game has gone through a lot of different stages. There was a version put out in the early 90's, I want to say by Sierra, on Windows 95 or 3.1. I don't remember.

929
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
There was a kind of version with souped up graphics that added some stuff to it.

930
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So, I don't know. Queltipo in chat says, Lode Runner was the game of choice in my school library. Ours was Monzuma Revenge in the early early days.

931
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And then when I got into junior high school, Scorched Earth. It's all about Scorched Earth.

932
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Kix. Kix.

933
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Sorry, Kix is what I was playing in school.

934
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Well, you had to issue Classic Game of the Week a few weeks ago for a reason.

935
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
You saw that they're making a Scorched Earth type game that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

936
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:23,000
That's awesome. I hope it has. You know like, Worms is kind of like Scorched Earth though.

937
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:33,000
But I want something that's really scaled back a bit in terms of you are a tank, you do not move.

938
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I love the craziness of Scorched Earth. Remember how you could get those nuclear bombs that would blow up off the screen?

939
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
That was what I was talking about.

940
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Just port Scorched Earth to Xbox Live Arcade. There would be a heck of people that would play it.

941
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:51,000
There was another one too, VGA Tank or something like that. There was a game just like it that came first.

942
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Whatever happened to Scorched Earth? What a great game.

943
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Alright, well anyhow, Lode Runner is also coming to Xbox Live Arcade soon.

944
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Well, there are certain people who I believe need anger management issues.

945
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Well, need anger management training. Well, not really so much as just need to not take out their frustrations on the inanimate object.

946
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:28,000
However, there was a man who had warned his three sons about how they were misbehaving while playing their Xbox.

947
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:38,000
And this is an old monstrosity, humongous Xbox. And so, he took their Xbox and nailed it to a tree.

948
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Ripped out the circuit board and everything and nailed it to a tree.

949
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Just like Jesus. Stop it. That must have been a big nail.

950
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:57,000
And their mother is saying that the problem was addressed properly. I think it was addressed very poorly.

951
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And if they feel like wasting however much it cost at the time, feel free to waste the money all you want to.

952
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:11,000
However, they are putting the nailed to a tree Xbox.

953
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Well, I should say the, or maybe as Loki was saying, the Jesus Edition Xbox on eBay. It's on an auction right now.

954
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Of course, because people are retarded and will pay lots of money for that crap. Remember that one? There was a kid...

955
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I was still, actually there was more to that.

956
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Sorry.

957
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Half of the proceeds are going to be going to their local schools and the other half will be going to the Children's College Fund.

958
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I hope no one buys this at all. Remember that supposed story that someone's kid or whatever smoked pot and so they sold his guitar hero online?

959
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
And they got like over a thousand dollars for it.

960
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Preposterous.

961
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It was just retarded. I mean, people do not buy this thing. It's a broken Xbox and you're really going to pay good money for it?

962
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I hope someone buys it because then I can laugh at them for being a big fucking idiot.

963
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:12,000
However, as was the most important question that rises from this as Joystiq asks, will it blend?

964
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
No.

965
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I bet it will.

966
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
This type of idiocy will not blend.

967
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Well, at any rate, I definitely, I want to find out who wins the auction just so that I can publicly ridicule them.

968
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I need good laughing water.

969
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Some people disagree. Shouran in chat says this dad kicks ass.

970
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:38,000
There you go. I find it interesting that it's funding the Kids College Fund though. It's kind of an interesting little side effect to it.

971
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Alright. I hate to back up and go to the last story, but damn, I was curious and Bobby Blackwell filled me in as well on some stuff going on.

972
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Apparently, there is a like Java version of Scorched Earth that you can play online and he actually gave me the address here scorched2000.com.

973
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
You can actually still play Scorched Earth and I was looking at Wikipedia though. I don't think that's an official port.

974
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It's some type of clone game, but apparently, according to Wikipedia, back in 2005, the original developer said that more information on the official version might surface soon.

975
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:18,000
It was reiterated in 2006. Apparently, there's some type of Scorched Earth project that's been going on since March of 2006.

976
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:24,000
You can get a CD called Totally Scorched through the official website of Scorched Earth for 20 bucks.

977
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I might have to see if I can find this guy and get him on the show. I think it would be awesome. I want to talk about Scorched Earth.

978
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Alright. However, I do not want Xbox Tree Dad on our show. I think I would just not be able to control it.

979
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I'd have to make fun of him too.

980
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:49,000
A little silly. I don't know. You're right. It's more the person who buys this than him. I mean, you know, however you want to parent your kids is your business.

981
01:36:50,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I think that he was right to punish the children, but why not just put the functional Xbox on eBay and then that way you're getting money for selling a functional product?

982
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Whatever happened to just taking the cord? Seriously?

983
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
See, that never worked with me because I would always find it.

984
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
It never worked with me either.

985
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:22,000
My mother took my TV away. This is how much of a brat I was. My mother took my TV away and I went and took it back and hooked everything back up and told her she couldn't do that because it was theft because she never bought it for me.

986
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Better yet, and I know we're kind of contributing to this, why is this news? I know. I mean, seriously, it's like kids get punished in some creative way and I mean, who reported on this first?

987
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I mean, obviously we reported on a story that someone else reported on, but did this like make the paper? I mean, is this like in Iowa or something, you know, where nothing happens?

988
01:37:46,000 --> 01:38:00,000
The person who needs to actually make themselves a username instead of being OL army, recruit, whatever, just linked the article up, well, the eBay auction, I should say.

989
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
So it is...

990
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Well, right now 850. So good. No one's really bidding on this.

991
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Sick sad world.

992
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,000
But the user's name is blocked, whoever's bid on it. I don't know, part of me wants to go in or bid on this.

993
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
No, do not. I'm tempted. I'm so tempted.

994
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:28,000
All right. I just, what else do I want to say real quick about, ah, I forgot. Train derailed. Oh, well, we'll move on. Maybe I'll think of it later.

995
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Did your train sink in the ocean?

996
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Yes, it did. There was something else I wanted to say about this whole thing. Was it something I wanted to read and chat? I think it was.

997
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Sorry. I'm sorry for the quietness. I'm reading the chat here. Joshi, Joshi 16 says, I don't believe it. This is a quick way to sell a broken console.

998
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Very interesting.

999
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I can just make up a cockamamie story about...

1000
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Yes.

1001
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Yes, and you get it on the news and people will do it.

1002
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:06,000
But, see, I'm not an idiot that ruins my own systems. Everything that I have is still functional except for one 7800 that needs a new power supply.

1003
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Like, take a console system and say it's haunted or something and, like, come up with some sort of YouTube viral video and sell it.

1004
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Tiger Claw says, what the dad did was appalling. There was a perfectly good Xbox. The kids are going to be screwed when they find out their brand new Xbox 360 has limited backwards compatibility.

1005
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I know what I wanted to say earlier about the whole taking the cord thing. What I found out was that when my mom would take the cord to my Nintendo, that the cord from her VCR would work just fine in replacement.

1006
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Sony?

1007
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Yeah, it was the old RCA red, yellow things. They're all the same. So I would just take the cord from her VCR and it would work just fine in the Nintendo and she was not happy. Not happy.

1008
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I, you know, and I'm not condoning any other kids to be exactly as brat-tastic as I was. And dark tastic, yeah, the 7800s have a really weird power supply.

1009
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:06,000
But they were also fairly unreliable as far as how well they stayed functional. So if you find a working one, you hold on to it.

1010
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:13,000
But I was, I was, yeah, thank you, Bobby. I was a real big brat and I'm not ashamed of myself.

1011
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I have to read it. Bobby says you all, you were all brats. You should be ashamed. We really were.

1012
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I'm not ashamed because my bratliness meant that I actually had a brain and was willing to use it to my own benefit. And now that I'm an adult, I can use my brain even better.

1013
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Bobby says you will never grow up to amount to anything. Happy face.

1014
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Yeah, too many people said that. Look at me now.

1015
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Here we are on the internet. Alright, look at me now.

1016
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Yeah, well, I'm a celebrity on the internet, so whatever.

1017
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I do what I want. Alright, let's move on please, Loki, before we get too ghetto.

1018
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Well, something that's not going to amount to anything apparently is the 2008 edition of the Digital Life Expo.

1019
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It's been cancelled because of poor economic conditions. You people are too poor, so I don't know.

1020
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:09,000
So, yes, apparently the last two years, you know, they had a significant gaming presence and facing lack of interest in the show.

1021
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:20,000
In 2007, Ziff Davis' apparent strategy was to put more focus on gaming for the 2008 edition, but that's not going to happen this year obviously.

1022
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
So, here's hoping for 2009.

1023
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,000
So, just because of the recession, that's what they're chalking it up to?

1024
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Yep.

1025
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Huh. Well, I guess that's too bad.

1026
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Apparently the conventions run off of pure gasoline, and so, you know, gas price is going up.

1027
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I love that they had to use twigs and, you know, fire.

1028
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Alright, well, sorry to say, but Digital Life 2008 is cancelled.

1029
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
There you go. For those of you that have already butchered plane tickets.

1030
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Anyhow, I'm sure we have a lot of New Yorkers who are very pissed off at the news that Digital Life 2008 is cancelled because there were some that used to always call in and talk to us about it.

1031
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
So, in your honor, we will do the FUs of the Week right now.

1032
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:36,000
My FU of the week goes towards my husband being at the GameCrazy Manager Conference in Las Vegas and me not being able to go to Las Vegas.

1033
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I'm sorry, did I say that out loud? Oops. But no, I actually do miss my boy a bit, and the sad thing is that he'll be coming back Wednesday, but we'll be leaving Thursday, so I actually have to miss my art class.

1034
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Like, maybe go to an hour of it, so I'm trying to think of how I can balance going to school and going to school.

1035
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Yeah, because you still have to get to the airport like an hour and a half early for all the check-ins and all that crap. So, fun fun.

1036
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Leave the house at four, because you've got traffic on top of that.

1037
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Lowkey, what are your FUs of the Week?

1038
01:43:51,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Like a normal American, I'm not going to take responsibility for it anyways.

1039
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:22,000
This is why you play video games instead of real games.

1040
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:36,000
As long as you're in direct sunlight for fifteen minutes, your body will make a sufficient amount of vitamin D, which you need to be healthy, so good for you being outside.

1041
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Um, I'll make my FUs short. Um, FU to breakups. They're no fun at all. We'll just leave it at that. The end. Let's go on, talk about other stuff, such as...

1042
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:09,000
A stupid award to give away tonight. To this woman, Kimberly Jernigan. What the hell did she do?

1043
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Well, she played Second Life, but that's not the only reason why we're giving her one.

1044
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:28,000
This is why we have to give a lot of people a stupid award. Apparently, here's the thing, she was actually having a romance in Second Life, and when her Second Life boyfriend guy dumped her or whatever...

1045
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Who was a lion. Or a tiger.

1046
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:51,000
And bears, oh my. Apparently, here's what happened. The cops said that what this chick tried to do, she tried to kidnap her ex-boyfriend guy online, and he was some 52 year old guy, and he was a lion, and she was a human.

1047
01:45:51,000 --> 01:46:06,000
She tried not only to just kidnap him once, she tried to kidnap him three times. And she was driving up from North Carolina to come kidnap this guy or whatever, and she brought her dog with her the third time.

1048
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:22,000
And so she cut the screen to get into this person's house, and was waiting for him to get home from work, and the dog kept barking, and so what did the gal do? She bound the dog and locked him in the bathroom.

1049
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
So, F you to this lady right here for being so cruel to animals.

1050
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Finally, the lion guy gets home, and she had a pair of handcuffs with her, and a laser. Yes, that's right, a laser. Like, I'm gonna shine it in your eyes, you little bastard! I don't know.

1051
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:51,000
So finally, she runs from the scene, leaving the poor dog behind. She did, by the way, get caught at a turnpike rest stop in the state of Maryland, and there it is.

1052
01:46:51,000 --> 01:47:01,000
There it is. I mean, you're not helping the whole stereotypes around Second Life players, seriously.

1053
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I was gonna say, there was also another one I had posted as part of, like, the Stupid Awards there, about some stupid kid who snuck onto his grandpa's eBay account and bought a Wii for almost 200,000 euros, and the funny thing was, he already had a Wii.

1054
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
So parents, watch your kids, because they're bastards.

1055
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And in regards to our recipient of the Stupid Award this week, DJ Dark Knight in Chat says, that's a crazy bitch. I couldn't have said it any better myself.

1056
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I mean, is she really surprised that her relationship with the lion didn't work out? I mean, seriously, that wouldn't have ended well anyways, and think of what the babies would have looked like.

1057
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Footy Monster says she was gonna go pew pew pew on the lion dude. Seems like a flawless plan.

1058
01:47:50,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Mm-hmm. I am pleased to see, though, it's not just, you know, the guys becoming crazy and going after the women. You know, equal sexual representation here.

1059
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Women are capable of going crazy too, right Dark Sakura?

1060
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
What do you mean by that?

1061
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Never mind.

1062
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
You just need to stop that train of thought right there, and just be nice.

1063
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I'm always nice. I'm the king of nice on the internet.

1064
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
The king of something.

1065
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Do we have more gaming news by chance?

1066
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Yes, and we have good gaming news. Very, very good gaming news.

1067
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:50,000
As I'm sure everyone knows by now, I've been super, super excited about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Cross Generation, which is going to be out in Japan this year, and they're actually talking about bringing it out on Wii because they're saying that the title will be on a Wii-compatible board.

1068
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:57,000
So, I don't know. I guess maybe. So that would be kind of neat.

1069
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,000
But I would be afraid of what it would look like on the Wii because it doesn't look like a Nintendo 64 game right now.

1070
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I'm sorry, did I say that out loud? No, I'm kidding.

1071
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I think it would actually be okay on Wii. I think it would be alright.

1072
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
But I don't want to play a fighting game on the Wii. I do not want to play a fighting game on the Wii.

1073
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Unless we, you know, maybe on the classic controller or something.

1074
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Or Smash Brothers.

1075
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I want this to be out on PS3 or Xbox 360. That's what I want.

1076
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I want an arcade machine in my house. Now.

1077
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
How long until this game comes out?

1078
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Soon?

1079
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Fair enough.

1080
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
We don't have much year left.

1081
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I guess that's true. That's true. So I'm sure Dark Soccer will be importing this sooner rather than later.

1082
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
It's always next year. But, I don't know.

1083
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
No!

1084
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:56,000
So, it's another day and Nintendo's been sued again for the Wii.

1085
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Oh yes, someone else claims that they thought of the Wii first in Hillcrest Laboratories this time.

1086
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
They are basically suing them for using their motion controller inventions.

1087
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:15,000
And Hillcrest is seeking to block imports of the Wii and Wii Remote.

1088
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Why just imports? That's kind of weird.

1089
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:24,000
And according to a complaint filed with the US International Trade Commission,

1090
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:31,000
they are also filing a civil lawsuit in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland.

1091
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And it says, while Hillcrest Labs has a great deal of respect for Nintendo and the Wii,

1092
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Hillcrest Labs believes that Nintendo is in clear violation of its patent and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights.

1093
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And the three patents that they hold are for motion controller technology.

1094
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
The fourth is for a graphic user interface.

1095
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:04,000
And I guess they're behind the motion control technology of FreeSpace and a graphic interface called Home.

1096
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I don't know if that's the same as Sony's home, I assume not.

1097
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,000
So, everybody wants a piece of the wee pie.

1098
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Apparently.

1099
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I think they should just go on Judge Judy and settle this all, don't you think?

1100
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Well, I mean, I don't know. I know patent lawsuits take a while, but seriously, it's like two years after this console's been out and you're just now suing them.

1101
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I mean, I have a hard time believing that they heard that this was coming out, they knew what it was, and they saw it come out, and it's using their technology,

1102
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:58,000
and if they were legitimately trying to block them because they were planning on releasing something like that, I think they waited too long, and this is just a cry for money.

1103
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Can you imagine what it might be like if Nintendo and these guys did go to Judge Judy?

1104
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Get a life, you know, get a real job.

1105
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I eat morons like you up for breakfast.

1106
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:19,000
You may live as, hopefully, as long as I'm, but you're not as smart as I am yet.

1107
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
That's right, just as the American way on Judge Judy.

1108
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
All right.

1109
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Well, hopefully Nintendo doesn't get too sued, or the game that Dark Soccer and I are most looking forward to, Animal Crossing City Folk, is never going to come out.

1110
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It has to!

1111
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Yes, it definitely has to. Well, here's some new things that have been announced about Animal Crossing City Folk.

1112
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I mean, not just, you know, what Loki talked to us about earlier, but apparently, here's some interesting things.

1113
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:53,000
If you actually played Animal Crossing Wild World on the DS, you can now send your avatar from the DS game to the new game.

1114
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Also, you can take your travel data and actually download it to the DS.

1115
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,000
So I'm wondering if that means that you can actually, like, take your Wii game, download the travel information to the DS, and go to a friend's house,

1116
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
so that we don't have to haul, like, everything over, since there's, like, no memory cards, really, on the Wii.

1117
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I mean, I guess technically they have the SD card, but not a lot of people have that, so, kind of interesting.

1118
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
My question, and this is kind of interesting, how the fuck would you do that?

1119
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Because if you, I guess you could, no, you can't even really save it to your DS, because there's no storage on the DS.

1120
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I don't know.

1121
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Unless they're hinting that there's storage on the DS, and they accidentally admitted to it.

1122
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Or there's extra storage data available on the cartridge, maybe?

1123
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Or why don't they have it where you can, I don't know, save it to an SD memory card, since there's an SD memory card slot on the damn machine that they don't use for anything? Seriously.

1124
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Well, anyhow, in a little less rantable news, holiday events are also coming back for the Wii.

1125
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Jingle the Reindeer comes back for Toy Day, which, you know, is just Christmas in a non-offensive way.

1126
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Apparently there's a new character, Zipper T. Bunny, who shows up for Bunny Day.

1127
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Hmm, I wonder what Bunny Day could be. Could it be a random Sunday between March and April? Who knows?

1128
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:22,000
That was stolen from pagan religions. That was a fertility holiday.

1129
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Well, that would make sense that it's a rabbit.

1130
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Hi! Eggs, bunnies! It's a holiday about screwin'.

1131
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:37,000
But really, we should really focus on the true nature of Animal Crossing, is that it hasn't changed in three games.

1132
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Look, all I want to know, can I still hit people with bug nets?

1133
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
That's all I want to know.

1134
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I'm pretty sure you can't, because it hasn't changed in three games.

1135
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Alright. Every week you send us your love and adoration and cards and letters to our mailbag.

1136
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Mailbag at orangelandrater.com and DarkSakura opens up the old mailbag and reads some of her favorite emails.

1137
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
But if I remember right, there's not a lot this week, is there?

1138
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
There are three.

1139
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Which means we got an extra during the show.

1140
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Mailbag at orangelandrater.com if you'd like to send in your emails.

1141
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
What? Uh oh.

1142
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Sauce just said Jesus died so he can eat chocolate.

1143
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Alright, let's open up the old mailbag.

1144
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
The first email, um, it says, uh,

1145
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Dear C4 and Kagabra and the OLR crew, I've been listening to your show since, oh my god the spelling is atrocious, since episode 1 and I filled up my mp3 player for years and gave me all the gaming info before...

1146
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Bad grammar makes Jamie cry.

1147
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Before is not spelled letter B number 4, it's B-E-F-O-R-E. V is spelled T-H-E, not D-A. Magazines is spelled M-A-G-I-Z-I-N-E-S, not M-A-G-A-Z-E-E-N-S.

1148
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Ugh!

1149
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Did and saved me tons of cash in the year to buy, you spell anime right? What the fuck?

1150
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:10,000
And manga, my collection, my girlfriend, cheer princess wants a D-S for PS, god use periods! I'm not reading this email.

1151
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
No, you have to read the very end, because it does explain a little bit of the crappy email.

1152
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I know, but it was typed on a Wii, no spell or grammar check, well screw it! I don't need grammar check! And they make a thing called a dictionary.

1153
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Actually, they do have the mode where you type it in stuff, you start to type it in and it spells it for you, so...

1154
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
That's lame.

1155
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:39,000
You know, if I was all into the sound boards as much as the chat room thinks I am, this is the part where I would play the clip from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

1156
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
You get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!

1157
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Next email.

1158
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Okay, now I'm gonna finish it, because I'm a nice person.

1159
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Alright.

1160
01:56:50,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I'm trying to be nicer to people, and I mean nothing bad against this person as a person, just don't be so fucking lazy. It's not hard, it doesn't take that much more time to type it.

1161
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Or to use your actual email.

1162
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Alright, yeah.

1163
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Okay. She loves MySpace and mystery and roleplay games, what should I get her? PSP or a DS? Get her a DS. And advice on how to get more than five listeners on my podcast, Pokefan Radio.

1164
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:35,000
You know, advertise, dude. Go out and whore yourself out. We used to post on all these different message boards and put a link to our podcast and our radio station and our signatures and just posted the fuck out of them, so go for that.

1165
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
That's what you should do.

1166
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:47,000
And I feel bad that you have a level 70 and your girlfriend only has a level 10, but you do need to study.

1167
01:57:47,000 --> 01:58:00,000
You know, to translate his email into English, he says that his girlfriend says to log off and study or he's gonna drop out and live in his mother's basement.

1168
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:06,000
And that he sleeps in class. Your email is quite evident of this.

1169
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:15,000
It's really a good idea if you log off of World of Warcraft and pay more attention in English class. Please.

1170
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Please. I'm urging you to take the goddamn time to pay attention and to spell shit right and use periods.

1171
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
He used one period. Okay, I'm impressed. He used one.

1172
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Oops, sorry about that. You just got a break in the podcast there. We had some live difficulties in the studio when I tried to play a sound clip.

1173
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:43,000
It screwed up the recording of the show. Right in the middle of Jamie's rant, which is probably to the blessing of the email.

1174
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Hey! Well, during the middle of this though, Loki and I made some special announcements that only the live listeners get to hear.

1175
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,000
There you go. All the more reason to tune in live Sunday nights.

1176
01:58:54,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Yeah. So, next email. Dun dun dun. Just in case you guys needed some mail. Thank you, cause we did. Anyways, I'm a new listener. A.K.A. the 56 care came in on episode 283, but just wanted to say what's up. Your show is the best. I need to get all the back episodes as possible, being as it's the only thing that gets me through the night at work.

1177
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:23,000
You guys rock. Keep on doing your thing and I'll keep on listening. I'm gonna try to change my hours at work so I can tune in live on Sundays. I'll let you know how that goes anyway later.

1178
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Also, you need to use capitalization and punctuation and through is spelled T-H-R-O-U-G-H, not T-H-R-E-W.

1179
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:40,000
But thanks for listening. But seriously, it's time to go broadband. I mean, if you're still on 56k, you poor thing. Poor, poor thing.

1180
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I know. But, you know, I provide these grammar and spelling lessons as a public service. It's free. I am trying to better the world through proper grammar and spelling.

1181
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
One word at a time.

1182
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Exactly. Last email, I think. Regarding your latest PSA, if Triple H retires from wrestling, would it be acceptable to walk up to McMahon and say you just lost the game? Didn't think so. I love wrestling jokes, really. That made me laugh.

1183
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Blink, blink, blink, blink.

1184
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Rob doesn't watch wrestling. He likes glow. The gorgeous ladies of wrestling.

1185
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Yeah, I like watching-

1186
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
And it's all about Godiva.

1187
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I like watching lady wrestling. One night at Rocky Horror, we actually did a wrestling themed night at Rocky Horror Picture Show. We did a TLC match. We did a tables, ladders, and cookie sheets. It was fun.

1188
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
That sounds pretty great.

1189
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:37,000
It was pretty awesome.

1190
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Also, also, also, last part to this.

1191
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I got to play the A-hole guy that's in charge of the W-D- what's his name?

1192
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:43,000
He has to be McMahon.

1193
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
McMahon. Yeah, but we changed everybody's name slightly, so I was him.

1194
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Also, is it acceptable to be offended by people being offended? What about being offended by people being- this is from Robert M.

1195
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:01,000
You know what, just everyone needs to learn how to get over themselves and be a little bit more accepting of everybody else around them.

1196
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
The end!

1197
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:13,000
If you want to send us some emails and get Taunted by Jamie, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com. Have your spelling and grammar evaluated.

1198
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I corrected my teacher!

1199
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,000
You should start grading their emails based on their spelling and grammar.

1200
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Well, those last two just got an E.

1201
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Look, well not the very last one, but my teacher put in the syllabus that if we can ever find any spelling or grammatical errors that he puts in any of the documentation he puts out on the website for my painter class, then we get an extra bonus point for class.

1202
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:46,000
And I found one right away and emailed it to him, so I now have a bonus point for the class. We hadn't even done anything.

1203
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Alright, let's get back to gaming news before we turn into the grammar podcast or whatever.

1204
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
There's a really good one too!

1205
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
We inspire you all to do more gooder on your emails.

1206
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Alright, Loki. Well, yet another rumor that came true. The PSP 3000 was announced at Leipzig this week, and like the rumors had stated, it has a built-in microphone and a PlayStation button instead of a home button.

1207
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Other changes that have happened, the LCD screen is a lot more responsive and also a little bit brighter or easily viewed in the highlight situations.

1208
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:49,000
And supposedly they're going to be updating the core pack, which will be coming out in November, which will come with a black system, a 4GB memory stick, and a voucher for everyday shooter.

1209
02:02:50,000 --> 02:03:00,000
And what's kind of neat also, the PSP 3000 is a little bit more rounded, but that's basically it.

1210
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
And it comes with pie. And that's why I want one.

1211
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
No, the pie is a lie.

1212
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
What? No free Marie Callender's pie? What's up with that?

1213
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,000
I don't know.

1214
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I just thought with everything else they were throwing in, maybe they'd throw in a pie. Who doesn't like pie?

1215
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I don't like pie.

1216
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Well, you're the devil.

1217
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Rob, let's go get pie.

1218
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Pie would be amazing right now.

1219
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
It would be. And I have to drown my sorrows in pie.

1220
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I gotta move on. You can drown your sorrows in two new games coming out. They're coming out on the PSP, but here's the neat thing about it.

1221
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:38,000
These games are not only going to be hitting stores for the PSP, they're actually going to hit PSN at the exact same time. In Japan, anyway.

1222
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
And it's all happening in October.

1223
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:51,000
The games that are going to be released simultaneously, Bleach Soul Carnival, because you just need another Bleach game, and Yusha no Kusei ni Namikadikida is coming out.

1224
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Digital distribution and the exact same day a PSP retail counterpart, exact same time.

1225
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Both versions are only going to send you back 1000 yen. That's about $10 or so.

1226
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
So, kind of interesting there.

1227
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I take that back. The downloadable version is actually $10 less.

1228
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,000
So, huh. I wonder if, you know, because there's no case, no manual, no disc, whatever.

1229
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
So, kind of interesting there, the approach they're taking.

1230
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
I don't know if that's a dangerous one or what.

1231
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:27,000
But, it's happening in Japan, not here, so it'll be interesting to see if it sets any precedence for here or if they try to do something similar here.

1232
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Who knows? We'll see.

1233
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I'm sorry, I gotta say this.

1234
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
May Satsuma in chat says this.

1235
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,000
PSP 3000 came with Pi. It should be called PSP 3.14 then.

1236
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Nice. I get it. I see what you did there.

1237
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Good job.

1238
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Math joke.

1239
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I love math jokes.

1240
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Okay.

1241
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:55,000
I know I have mentioned this before that there, in Brazil, there is a big following for the Mega Drive.

1242
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:06,000
To the extent that even some games that were released on the Sega Genesis were actually released in Brazil on the Master System because it was so popular.

1243
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Well, now, because it's still popular, what has been released now by Tech Toy, which is a Sega licensee,

1244
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:28,000
the Master System 3 is now out and it looks sort of like an old Genesis and it has a Sonic painted on it in blue, like an outline Sonic.

1245
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:40,000
It has 131 built-in games on it, G-rated games, so it has no cartridge slot and retails for about $133.

1246
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:46,000
It actually, and I'm going to the webpage to see if it's hopefully not written in Portuguese.

1247
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Okay, some of the games that are on it.

1248
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Shadow Dancer, which was one of the really good Shinobi games.

1249
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Alice Kid in Miracle World, Shinobi World, Lost Stars, High Tech World, those.

1250
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
You also have Enduro Racer, E-SWAT, which was one of those games that was downgraded.

1251
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2, Fantasy Zone 3, Golden Axe, hang on.

1252
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Ken Seiden, what's another good one that was on here?

1253
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Thunder Blade, Super Space Invaders, Sonic Drift 2, and Rainbow Islands, Rastan Saga.

1254
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Lots of good stuff.

1255
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Huh, well...

1256
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Oh, and Battle Outrun.

1257
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:44,000
You know, hey, there's lots of folks that love the nostalgia. I'm sure if they released something like that up here, some people would buy it.

1258
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Because hey, they do those, the Genesis controller type things that have all the Sonic games in them, those sell really well.

1259
02:06:51,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I'll have to tell you, Rob, I actually am very, even though I have almost all of the games on the list that were out as actual Master System games,

1260
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:05,000
I'm actually considering that this might be a worthwhile purchase for my house.

1261
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Why not? Add it to the museum.

1262
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:15,000
You can actually download a lot of them emulated, and really, they're very solid ports of the games.

1263
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:24,000
There's even, I believe, a copy of Strider that came out on Master System in Brazil that was supposed to be pretty darn good for a Master System game.

1264
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:29,000
I'd like to hear from some of our Brazilian listeners. Let us know what you think of this.

1265
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Do we have any Brazilian listeners?

1266
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
I think we do.

1267
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
You don't even have to tell us what you think of this. Just say, hi, I'm from Brazil, because I'm curious if we actually have listeners there.

1268
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Alright, moving on.

1269
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Right, we've got a bunch of homebrew news and hacking news to tell you about.

1270
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,000
So, real quickly, I mentioned four things that are kind of neat.

1271
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:56,000
First, Sailor Moon. Apparently, there's some guy making a few homebrew Sailor Moon games,

1272
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:04,000
some of which are going to be on the Wii, and they are sprite-based brawlers, which is kind of interesting.

1273
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Well, they've released actual Sailor Moon fighting games. My first important game was the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game.

1274
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:23,000
But, what's even bigger than that, of course, and how we cannot forget this, the Wii has been hacked to allow DVD video playback.

1275
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:40,000
There's a patch, well actually, you can install a program using the homebrew channel, and it will allow you to play DVDs, like DVD movies.

1276
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:53,000
And also, they have enabled DVD-capable homebrew programs, such as Nintendo 64 emulators that can read ROMs straight off of a DVD disc.

1277
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
So, way to go beating Nintendo at their own game.

1278
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,000
That is actually all kinds of funny, I have to admit. Come on, who isn't thinking this is hilarious?

1279
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:11,000
For the DS, there are some interesting homebrew games out there. One that I thought looked really weird was Magnetic Shaving Derby.

1280
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Basically, you control a magnet using your DS stylus, and you attract a razor blade across a weird-looking face, and try not to cut the guy.

1281
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:39,000
So, I don't know. That's kind of interesting. If that's not your cup of tea, then maybe you should check out one of the many games that are available, thanks to the Nioh Summer Coding Competition 2008.

1282
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:53,000
They have lots of cool games for the DS, Game Boy Advance, and the PSP, and they're all homebrew, including updates, of course, to still-live DS.

1283
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:03,000
There's some other neat things. There's some sort of, I don't know, chess game. They've got some puzzle games.

1284
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Lots of neat-looking stuff. There's some platformers in there. Lots of cool stuff to check out, especially if you have homebrew-enabled portable systems.

1285
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,000
And you can find that on the forums of neoflash.com.

1286
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Lots of stuff going on in the hacking and homebrew world this week. We DVD players sometimes.

1287
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
And we'll have some more stuff for Last Minute Stories as well.

1288
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Alright, well then, before we get to Last Minute Stories, we've got one more story for you before we open up the Skype line.

1289
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,000
And by the way, tonight's Skype line is only accessible tonight at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1290
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
The 800 number is down. It's not the 800 number that's down. Our Skype end number is down.

1291
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Because I failed at renewing it on time, so I'll have to do that after the show.

1292
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,000
So tonight, guys, we can only get access through the Orange Lounge Radio username on Skype.

1293
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
That's how the majority of you are calling us anyway.

1294
02:10:50,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Something that has been announced at X08 in Toronto. Duke Nukem 3D is coming out for the Xbox Live Arcade sometime in September.

1295
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Which is pretty cool, because that means, like, soon.

1296
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:11,000
And new to Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade? A saved film and gameplay rewind feature.

1297
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I mean, if you thought it was cool in Braid, it's going to be even more awesome when you can actually just rewind.

1298
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I don't know if it's the touch of a button or how that's going to work, but you'll actually be able to rewind gameplay if you want to undo something you screwed up.

1299
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
And then if you want to share...

1300
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Like with an emulator?

1301
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
I guess so. Which is kind of neat.

1302
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:39,000
You can also save films, like if you have an especially memorable time that you shot a stripper and you want to share it with your friends, you could put it on a film.

1303
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:47,000
And YouTube's galore! Just wait for it. Duke Nukem 3D. I hope the graphics are getting a little bit of a touch up, though.

1304
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
That's one thing I'm kind of looking forward to.

1305
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Alright, if you want to give us a call, you can on the Skype line. OrangeLoungeRadio is our username on Skype.

1306
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Please, if you're going to use Skype to give us a call, please make sure you've contacted Echo123 at some point before you call us. It's already ringing.

1307
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1308
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Hey, hey, it's Ronmo.

1309
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Well, hello! You always seem to get through first. What's on your mind, buddy?

1310
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Not too much. I have a few things I want to discuss. I'll make everything as quick as possible.

1311
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Sure.

1312
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:31,000
I remember as a kid, I got in trouble for doing something stupid and my mother grabbed my new Tetris 2 game, the power adapter, and both my controllers and sent me off somewhere.

1313
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:37,000
When she left, I waited about a good hour after she left the house, I went and found myself and hooked it back up.

1314
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
She probably was not happy when she got back home.

1315
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Yeah, there's still a mark on the back of my back as a reminder when she discovered what I did.

1316
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Ouch, sorry to hear it, but bad boy, bad boy.

1317
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
What else is on your mind?

1318
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:13,000
That was then, but as for this whole digital life thing, my theory is that because digital life is the same weekend as New York Anime Festival and the people that run NYAF, real expeditions, need a large space, I don't think it was able to accommodate. That's my theory.

1319
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Interesting. You don't think it has anything to do with just competing expos or maybe general, like a lot of folks say that digital life was not all that last year.

1320
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:27,000
I would think if it's conflicting space issues that they could, I don't know, reschedule.

1321
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Yeah, because the thing was, all the second floor was going to be digital life and downstairs was going to be NYAF.

1322
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,000
But from what I'm hearing, NYAF is going to be the entire second floor like Comic Con was this past year.

1323
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:49,000
And from my understanding that they were letting people have free passes to digital life, so you know, I went last year and I had a great time.

1324
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Well, who knows? I mean, I guess they are rescheduling it for 2009.

1325
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
No sweat off my back.

1326
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Well, you know, it sucks to be the DDR people who are all excited about it.

1327
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Exactly. For them, there's Dave & Busses and Chinatown Fair.

1328
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Exactly. Anything else, Rama?

1329
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Quick wrap-up of Otacon, because I know the Rob D is trying to call in to cover the game room aspect of it, so we went this year and it was great.

1330
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:23,000
What about, since you're an anime expert, what were some of the good cosplays you saw? Actually, I'm curious about video game cosplay specifically, though.

1331
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:33,000
There was more video gaming cosplay at Otacon than anime cosplay. The most popular was, believe it or not, Super Mario Bros.

1332
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Everybody was running around as Mario or Luigi. That was the thing this year.

1333
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Interesting. Kind of seems a little like a standard. You know, it's kind of like expecting to see, you're going to see a Naruto at some point or a Sailor Moon.

1334
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Yeah, there was some Sailor Moon cosplays, a lot of Naruto cosplays. I mean, there wasn't even as many Final Fantasy cosplays this year as normally.

1335
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:04,000
It's like, I guess, retro video gaming is a big thing, and my theory is after Super Mario Bros. came out, everybody wants to do Mario Bros. cosplay.

1336
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Plus, it's not that difficult, all things considered. I mean, it might be kind of complicated to do a really good one.

1337
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
If you really want to be precise, you get someone to make the nice hat, the gloves, but you know.

1338
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Right, right. Well, Rama, thank you so much for the varied call tonight.

1339
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Of course, of course.

1340
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Alright, have a good one, and have fun at that New York Anime Festival. It should be fun.

1341
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Later, I will.

1342
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Bye-bye. If you want to give us a call, OrangeLoungeRadio is our username on Skype. Our 800 number is down tonight.

1343
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,000
It will be back in a couple weeks when we're back live taking calls.

1344
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Hi, on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1345
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Hey, what's up? It's the Rob D.

1346
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Well, hey, speak of the devil. Rama just talked about you in the last call, so you went to Otakon this year.

1347
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Indeed I did. I took the 12 hour drive over to Baltimore, and that was rough.

1348
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Wow.

1349
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Especially going through Ohio. No offense to anyone. Actually, no complete offense to everyone in Ohio. Ohio sucked to drive through.

1350
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:05,000
It can't be as bad as some of the West Coast states to drive through. Like, have you ever really driven through New Mexico?

1351
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
No, I haven't.

1352
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,000
There are some very beautiful parts of New Mexico, don't get me wrong. No offense to the people that live there.

1353
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:19,000
But there's some parts of New Mexico that are like, damn. Or just anything east of Reno or Las Vegas and Nevada. It's pretty terrible, too.

1354
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Well, and we got a ticket while we were driving through Ohio, so that kind of taints my view on things, too.

1355
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Ouch. Yeah, that'd do it.

1356
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:32,000
That's something that was beautiful. But, as for the con itself, I posted the link to my photo album in chat, my photo bucket.

1357
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I went through some stuff. I actually see me dressed up as Terry Beauregard, which, I gotta say, I've been to Anime Central, and I went to Otakon this year.

1358
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:47,000
And I got a much better response over at Otakon. I had people, I couldn't actually take like, I don't know, 20 steps through the convention without someone yelling,

1359
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Are you okay? Or, hey, come on, come on, at me.

1360
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Nice.

1361
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
It was fun. But the game room was huge.

1362
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Is it just because, you know, as Ramo was saying, there's more people doing video game cosplay this year, or do you think that's why more people recognize you?

1363
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Ha, I like this Metal Gear one. That's great. Two people put their little faces in a transmitter cutout there. Love it.

1364
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Yeah, especially with the name reference, too, with Otakon and Otakon.

1365
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Ah, true, true.

1366
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I don't know, there was a lot of anime stuff. I actually kept an account of how many Shinigami versus how many Akatsuki I saw, you know, from Bleaching Naruto.

1367
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
It ended up being tied at 154.

1368
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Wow, I'm trying to, I, okay, wait, I found one of your Terry Beauregard, there, oh, you even got the hat there that says Fatal Fury.

1369
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
You cannot have the hat.

1370
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Whether it's the metal plate for Fatal Fury, or whether it says Neo Geo or Fatal Fury, you gotta have it.

1371
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Let's see, what else is there that you got pictures of here?

1372
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Lucas from Mother 3, I want to see that one.

1373
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Ah, I'm looking at your photo bucket, your username on photo bucket if other people want to look at this, it's TheReabd.

1374
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
The Reabd, because someone already had TheReabd, so.

1375
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Oh, what a jerk.

1376
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
It's T-H-E-R-E-A-B-O-D.

1377
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Nice, Aness and Lucas.

1378
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Yeah, I've got a pyramid hat. You can actually see Rama, and there's a black mage, too.

1379
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Really?

1380
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Yes, ah, you can look at the tags on the left. I have a tag that's Rama.

1381
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Oh, he's got a new outfit.

1382
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,000
In the dealer's room.

1383
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Nice, don't call him Heedy.

1384
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Oh, there's Rama, O-L-R.

1385
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Oh, no, that's the old one I knew. Okay, you have two black mages in there.

1386
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Oh, interesting. Sorry, this is making for a horrible radio, so.

1387
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
But definitely lots of video game cosplay.

1388
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,000
The game room was gigantic. There's actually a couple, a YouTube video, I think, of the game room.

1389
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Much, much bigger than the one over at ASN, but this one had pretty much an entire, I don't even know how to put it.

1390
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Probably about, if you took a Sam's Club and split it in half, that half would be how big the game room was.

1391
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Or a Costco, or whatever your regional giant bulk store would be.

1392
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,000
And they had everything. Lots of shooters, lots of fighting games.

1393
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Mostly, you know, most of the anime-related stuff.

1394
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Fatal Fury, Street Fighter.

1395
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I saw two people dressed up as Kenso from King of Fighters, which confused the heck out of me, because...

1396
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Kenso? Really?

1397
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,000
That's cool.

1398
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
And they kind of wanted to hang out with me since they found another guy with KOF cosplay, but...

1399
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Oh well.

1400
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I used to do Leona cosplay.

1401
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Look at YouTube here, just looks like a big line.

1402
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Let's see, I'm trying to find, let's see.

1403
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Yeah, I guess there's a huge line to get in the game room.

1404
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I've never seen a Leona cosplayer. That would have been nice, because a friend of mine and I went as Ralph and Clark to ASUN.

1405
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Well, at Anime Expo, two of my friends that I used to hang out with online, who each had a Ralph and Clark name for a while,

1406
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:46,000
we ended up going for the big KOF meet there, but my costume is about three sizes too big for me now.

1407
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
But I was thinking about remaking it.

1408
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Yeah, I think my favorite picture in that whole album is of Sergeant Frog as L from Death Note.

1409
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
So great.

1410
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
That's cool.

1411
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
But again, the game room, lots of stuff, lots of rhythm games, you know, again, it's pretty much all rhythm and fighting games.

1412
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Tons of people playing Brawl, I think they probably had like, I don't even know, eight or twelve TVs, giant HGTVs playing Brawl.

1413
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Gears of War, Halo 3, and Call of Duty 4 were there, which surprised me a little bit, but you know, you've got a lot of people that like to play that online, so it's not too shocking, I suppose.

1414
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Pretty much any fighting game you could ever want. KOF 98 on Neo Geo, KOF 11, what else, Marvel vs. Capcom.

1415
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I think I said I had one KVN, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Capcom vs. SNK 2, even Street Fighter Alpha 3 was there.

1416
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:44,000
So it's just fighting game heaven, but that doesn't surprise me really, considering, you know, it's, you know, anime con and all that.

1417
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Yeah, lots of rhythm games, Pop'n Music, DDR, I saw Beatmania there, what else?

1418
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Oh, and the best part about that was that those were hooked up to standard TVs instead of HDTVs, just so you didn't have the lag.

1419
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:05,000
What do you think of, speaking of Pop'n Music, what do you think of, I don't know if you were here during Part A, we talked about Beat'n Groovy, the Xbox Live Arcade port of Pop'n Music.

1420
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:08,000
I didn't hear about that. What's it gonna have on there?

1421
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Oh god, it's gonna be interesting.

1422
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
I don't know how that'll really work with the Xbox 360 controller.

1423
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Yeah, especially with that D-Pad.

1424
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Well, not really my thing, and I wouldn't expect it to work very well, especially since, is there even a 360 Pop'n Music controller? I doubt it.

1425
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:29,000
No, no. So it's gonna be different. Let's just leave it at that.

1426
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Alright, RobD, anything else you wanna share about Otacon with us?

1427
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I've got tons of stories, but honestly, nothing really short enough to say here.

1428
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Well, except the Kool-Aid Man made it quite a stir.

1429
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:47,000
There was a guy with a boombox in front of him, playing one of the jingles from the Kool-Aid commercial.

1430
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:53,000
It was almost like the Red Sea party wherever he went, because everyone just got out of the way and started taking pictures.

1431
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,000
That's pretty awesome, though. But what the hell does the Kool-Aid Man have to do with Otamakons?

1432
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
You see the most random stuff, but it's awesome.

1433
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Three people were thirsty. They needed Kool-Aid.

1434
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Alright, take care, RobD.

1435
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,000
See you later.

1436
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Hey, hey, hey!

1437
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Actually, that was fat Albert, but, you know, same thing.

1438
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Alright, we'll take one more call.

1439
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1440
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Hello?

1441
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Hi, who's this?

1442
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Hey, it's Ryama.

1443
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Hey, you're very, very quiet. Can you get a little closer to your mic?

1444
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Yeah, how's this?

1445
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Hello?

1446
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Any better? Hello?

1447
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,000
We can barely hear you. Get out your question and we'll try to answer it.

1448
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Uh, no, I just wanted to say hi. I don't know where my mic is.

1449
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Um, I just wanted, I haven't listened to Orange Launch Radio in forever, and I figured tonight I'd listen.

1450
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:58,000
So, hi, um, I don't really have a question. I just want to say I'm getting raped at Dr. Mario, and it's making me feel really bad about myself.

1451
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Alright, well thank you for the call, and good luck finding the microphone.

1452
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I'm hearing too much feedback on that call.

1453
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:13,000
I think he said something about getting raped at Dr. Mario? I don't know, maybe I misheard that, I don't know.

1454
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Anyway, well thanks for listening, and especially Mr. Hiyus.

1455
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1456
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Hello, Orange Launch Radio Land. It is a long-time listener, disappearing for a long time, reappearing for a short time, and, uh, lather, rinse, repeat.

1457
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Yeah, where the hell have you been?

1458
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Uh, busy. Life Sundays are not the most free for me anymore for a number of reasons, and that's about to start over, eh, excuse me, start over again.

1459
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Yeah, I'm sorry, I should have had you introduce yourself for those that don't know your voice.

1460
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Hi, I'm Jason. I'm a cool guy. I'm technically part of Orange Launch Radio 2.

1461
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:51,000
You are, you are. So I'm just looking at the awesome Pyramid Head cosplay that Rob D. is sharing with us.

1462
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Alright, so what's on your mind? So you've been busy, but what provokes the call tonight?

1463
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Um, I think that Konami should not make any more music games for America.

1464
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,000
You think that's it? They've used up all their chances.

1465
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:15,000
It's, it's not even that. I love Rock Band. I absolutely do. That game is absolutely amazing, and it is way more than Guitar Freaks' Drummania ever were.

1466
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:26,000
I loved Drummania. I loved Guitar Freaks. There's an arcade here that has the both of them. The Guitar Freaks is first mix, so I don't really play it, but the Drummania is V, and I go back and play it.

1467
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:38,000
It had good music. I liked it. It was a fun game, but for Americans, for sales, and the ability to persist and survive in this market, this market ain't gonna happen.

1468
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Well, you say they shouldn't make any more music games, but what about, you know, DDR, which, you know, has, you know, we covered that earlier. There's always those games coming out.

1469
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Okay, minus that one, because that one actually got popular somehow. Without, I guess it's the fact that so many other songs are English.

1470
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:01,000
It's so frustrating, though, because, you know, games like Beatmania had so much potential, and it's just, to see a whimper out is just very sad.

1471
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:09,000
You remember all the, uh, yay, tongue-tied, woo-hoo! Do you remember all the hoops we had to jump through to get 7 style?

1472
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
And now look how big 2DX is for consoles in Japan again.

1473
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Yeah, I remember. I wish I, I, which back then, I was highly critical of that whole thing, and I thought it was stupid.

1474
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Yes, I absolutely remember this. Years ago. It was one of the first things we talked about on the show, probably, at least, probably within the first year of OLR.

1475
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:31,000
And for those that weren't around, you know, six years ago, basically what Konami was doing is they, they, everybody had to sign a petition or something?

1476
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:37,000
A hundred and thousand, it was either a hundred thousand or two thousand, two hundred thousand signatures, and then a hundred thousand pre-orders.

1477
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Oh my, yeah, and then, like, if they didn't get so many pre-orders on the official website, they weren't gonna make the game.

1478
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:51,000
It was so dumb, like, you know, just, it was so, like, the way they were just teasing us, and well, I guess it worked, you know, the game eventually came out.

1479
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
And it's been doing very good ever since, at least in Japan, of course.

1480
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:59,000
So is that what they need to do here? If they're gonna release another BeatMania game here, force ten thousand people to pre-order?

1481
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:08,000
No, it's not gonna happen. People, it's, it's too weird, and the DJ culture is, while there are, of course, a lot of DJs, music performers and whatnot,

1482
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:17,000
it just doesn't have the same, I don't even know what the word is that I'm looking for, it's not American in the sense that it's not gonna take off like that.

1483
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:28,000
I mean, rock band is traditional, that is, in that genre of music, that is what, you know, American is all about, live performance, I am completely and totally screwing this up.

1484
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Sorry, no, no, no, would you say that Konami's biggest problem, outside of the DDR series, because that's successful, but Konami's biggest problem in launching these other series is that they have no idea how to choose songs?

1485
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:46,000
That's part of it, and just the manner of playing the games, how the games are played is just too different.

1486
02:26:46,000 --> 02:27:00,000
I mean, pop and music and 2DX are very out there, even people who would understand what the concept of a DJ is, is not gonna pick up on 2DX immediately, and you know us, and if I can't do it now, I'm not gonna do it.

1487
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:11,000
By us, I mean, you know, typical people who, ADHD, run through arcades, play something and then never again, unless it actually, you know, gave them something special or something along those lines.

1488
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:15,000
So why Rock Revolution? Why did Konami do this?

1489
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Because Konami is in America, because Konami is supposed to be the name, game, and face of music games, and because they have to exert their fantabulousness and it's not gonna work.

1490
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
It's a stripped down Guitar Freaks.

1491
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Why do this, though, why embarrass themselves with this game when they could explore a new idea in the music game world? Why go through this embarrassment?

1492
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Because they tried new in America, and it didn't work. That was Beatmania. They're trying new in America, that's beat and groovy, it's not gonna work.

1493
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:58,000
So they're trying what was popular, Rockband, Guitar Hero, let's bring a guitar game, but the unfortunate thing is, it's not gonna work, comparatively speaking, of course.

1494
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,000
What about what Bobby's saying in chat right now, they're only doing it for the patent lawsuit against MTV?

1495
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:14,000
A lot of people say that's the only reason why Supernova came out. I'm half tempted to believe them just because Supernova, the interface and all things associated, was done pretty horribly by comparison.

1496
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:22,000
I said this three years ago until I was blue in the face and I say it again now, the reason why In the Groove got smacked down is because they dared to enter the home console.

1497
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:27,000
If they had never done that, we'd still have In the Groove arcade machines today. Mark my words?

1498
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Mark my words. If they had just kept it in their pants and not tried to invade the home market, this would have never happened.

1499
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I'd like to mark your words, but I don't have a time machine, I'm sorry. We are not brave, we cannot hold the button and go backwards.

1500
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Fair enough. Alright, Jason, we gotta go soon and wrap up the show, any final thoughts?

1501
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
No, don't leave me, no.

1502
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
We have to, we'll be back.

1503
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Okay, alright, see you later, Jason.

1504
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Alright, guys. Alright, we always like hearing from the long time money fans.

1505
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Sorry for those who didn't get through tonight, but we gotta get out of here, wrap things up, but not before we get some last minute stories.

1506
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Narsak, have you got anything for us tonight?

1507
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
No, I do not.

1508
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,000
What? Who and blah?

1509
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Oh, yeah, actually the Ferret does.

1510
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Lowkey, do you have any last minute stories tonight?

1511
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Yeah, yeah, time.

1512
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I got time.

1513
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Make it quick, I'll try to.

1514
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Anyway, let's get started here.

1515
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Apparently, Sony thinks that the Mirror's Edge will be exclusive to them for some time bearing.

1516
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:44,000
It says, according to Reeves, Mirror's Edge will initially be exclusive to the PS3 this year, and the PC and Xbox 360 versions will be following much later.

1517
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Thankfully, they're wrong, so EA has come out and said, no, that's not true, and why they're spreading those kinds of rumors, they will never know.

1518
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Mega Man Star Force 3 got announced at, apparently, the Mega Man festival that was going on.

1519
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Yes, there was a Mega Man festival going on, and it'll be coming out in two different flavors, Black Ace and Red Joker, going for the card theme there.

1520
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Conduit is supposed to be shown at PAX, and they're going to be shown off at Nintendo's booth, which is kind of interesting, making you wonder, possibly, could Nintendo be publishing that game?

1521
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
That would make sense.

1522
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:40,000
I would hope that they would do that, but who knows, because right now they're saying that they still don't have a publisher, but that could be an announcement, you never know.

1523
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Let's see here.

1524
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Apparently, someone has finally hacked the PS3 to run backups. They're almost ready to release the exploit, I should say.

1525
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:11,000
It's being done kind of strangely. You have to have two hard drives for the PS3, and it will allow you to run games, any game, as long as you have a Playstation 3 game in the disk drive.

1526
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:24,000
I'm not sure how that's going to work, but they do have a video showing it being done, and I don't know, it's kind of weird.

1527
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Finally, let's see here, a couple other things. The Last Guy is coming out on August 28th on the Playstation Network, so that should be pretty cool, it's only about $10.

1528
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:54,000
And Disaster Day in Crisis may actually be coming out eventually. Apparently, the Australian version of the ESRB has raided the game, so maybe it's not disappeared after all. That's kind of cool.

1529
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Also, not to be outdone by the iPets, Nintendo is going to be getting Monkey Madness on the Wii, which is a monkey pet sim, so you can play with your monkey. Hooray.

1530
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Konami showed off a new game at Leipzig. It's not scheduled to come out until 2010. It is a game called Lords of Shadow, and kind of looks a little bit like a next-gen Castlevania.

1531
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Because it has the main character Gabriel, who sort of looks like he could be a Belmont, fighting off some sort of monster with a flaming chain whip.

1532
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:48,000
And if that doesn't scream Castlevania, I don't know what will. And those bastards in the UK have gotten Super Mario RPG on the Virtual Console, and I am angry.

1533
02:32:48,000 --> 02:33:06,000
But it's part of the new Hanabi Festival, which they will be getting a bunch of Japanese-only games. Hopefully that will be coming over here as well. The other thing they're going to be getting is the real Mario 2, or Mario The Lost Levels, as it was called over here.

1534
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Harmonix is teasing their next music game. They haven't really said what it is, but it... I talked about this at the end of part A. Oh, never mind. Never mind.

1535
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Fable 2, the pub games. There was an exploit in there where you can cheat and get lots of gold. Well, they're going to be fixing that, so if you want to still cheat, you'll just have to play it offline, so it doesn't patch.

1536
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:41,000
I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet by downloading it. Apparently Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be having some interesting modes for the Wii.

1537
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:48,000
You're going to be able to put your Miis in there and play Mii Freestyle, which is kind of like Wii Music a little bit.

1538
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:54,000
That's kind of interesting because Guitar Hero World Tour will actually be coming out before Wii Music does.

1539
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Speaking of music games, Bobby is quick to point out that we are neglecting that Moving Pictures is coming to Rock Band this Tuesday. That would be a Rush album, for those that don't know. That's going to be their big download content this week.

1540
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Grand Theft Auto IV for the PC is going to be getting a replay editor and also higher resolutions and enhanced multiplayer, so that's kind of cool. That's going to be coming out in November. Rock the Vote is going to be canvassing Xbox Live. That's kind of dumb.

1541
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Alone in the Dark, the PS3 version which is coming out in November, is going to be getting a whole bunch of patches to fix all the problems in the game. Well thankfully, if you bought a version of the Xbox 360 version of Alone in the Dark, you will also be getting those same patches that will be coming with a downloadable patch, probably around the time of the PS3 game.

1542
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:55,000
So, if you have the game that long, well then, it will be fixed.

1543
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:18,000
We talked a little bit about PS3 SKUs and stuff like that. There are some new announced SKUs for the UK, including a 160GB PlayStation 3 SKU with Uncharted and Pain and DualShock 3 for $4.99. That is going to be replacing the 80GB system that's currently available right now with Metal Gear Solid 4.

1544
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:33,000
And finally, the last thing, Red Alert 3. They announced the cast for the game, and I gotta say it's got a lot of pretty awesome people in there.

1545
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Everybody from Jenny McCarthy, to Tim Curry, to Kelly Hugh, to George Takei, and just a whole bunch of people. So, it will be really funny.

1546
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Alright, that's it for Last Minute Stories.

1547
02:35:54,000 --> 02:36:09,000
One last one. I thought this was interesting. Apparently, someone found a glitch in Tiger Woods 08 that would allow Tiger Woods to basically walk on water and hit a ball on top of a lake.

1548
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Well, in response to that, EA decided to put out a viral video of Tiger Woods walking on water and hitting a golf ball off the water. Because apparently, he's Jesus.

1549
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Okay.

1550
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Completely off topic, Rob, for Christmas. I want a Bluetooth LED keyboard.

1551
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Good luck with that. And I want a pony.

1552
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I need a pony.

1553
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Alright, we're going to wrap up the show. It's time for us to get out of here. But not before we get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought.

1554
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:50,000
My final thought is PAX.

1555
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:55,000
My final thought is PIE. Dark Sakura.

1556
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:05,000
