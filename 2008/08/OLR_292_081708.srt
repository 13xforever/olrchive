1
00:00:15,643 --> 00:00:23,982
[SPEAKER_13]: The Guitar Hero be adding yet another instrument to the mix, Sony announces the iPad, and rumors of an Xbox motion controller

2
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:35,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:41,098
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:42,419
[SPEAKER_03]: We missed you last week.

5
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Our aim is improving though, isn't it DarkSakura?

6
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:46,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Splat.

8
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:48,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Lovely co-host of OLR.

9
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:49,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Splatter.

10
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:50,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Splat.

11
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:55,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of shooting things, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

12
00:00:57,018 --> 00:01:08,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Who apparently spent this morning shooting people in the face Yes And getting shot in the face I went and played Airsoft, it's a new hobby I'm getting into now Nice, what is Airsoft for the uninitiated?

13
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:21,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Airsoft is kind of like paintball, but instead of actually shooting balls of paint at people You have kind of like souped up BB guns that shoot plastic pellets at people And actually it doesn't hurt at all So you're not shooting balls at people's face?

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,361
[SPEAKER_02]: We are shooting balls at people's face.

15
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:24,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to judge.

16
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:26,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiny little white balls.

17
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:27,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

18
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:29,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on their color babies.

19
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:31,848
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

20
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:34,570
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you win or did you lose?

21
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we won three.

22
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:37,893
[SPEAKER_03]: How does one win or lose?

23
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:38,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't get shot?

24
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:39,614
[SPEAKER_02]: You win.

25
00:01:39,794 --> 00:01:42,276
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because we had different scenarios for each one we played.

26
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:48,261
[SPEAKER_02]: The first game we played was you had to occupy, there was like a, they call them kill houses.

27
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:50,223
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically little structures that they built.

28
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:52,056
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:31,271
[SPEAKER_02]: and you get the flag and then raise it and wave it in the air and then the last game was just played on the field sideways and was basically just kill the other team and it's kind of cool though because it's like a video game because you get different respawns so if you get shot you have to go back to this one spot and when three people get there you all respawn and stuff like that wow they actually say respawn that's cool

30
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:33,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there video games based on this, out of curiosity?

31
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:35,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not like dodgeball video games.

32
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:36,577
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no Airsoft games.

33
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:38,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of paintball games, but no Airsoft.

34
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:46,267
[SPEAKER_03]: The ever-present fourth co-host on our show, you, through the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and poor Leno in chat says, Airsoft rocks.

35
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:48,632
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fun.

36
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:54,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a P90, which is like the Stargate machine gun type thing.

37
00:02:55,096 --> 00:03:01,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Not because I like Stargate, because I don't, but just because it looks neat and it's shot well.

38
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:03,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have a sidearm as well.

39
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:07,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was playing the entire game with a sidearm and the P90.

40
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:10,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually at one point I charged at people with

41
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:16,873
[SPEAKER_02]: P90 in one hand because you can fire it with one hand and then the sidearm and I got shot, but it was still fun.

42
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:19,815
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, wow, OLR is getting violent.

43
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:21,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I know lots of gun talk tonight.

44
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,177
[SPEAKER_03]: It's OLR gun night.

45
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:24,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gun show night on OLR.

46
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I tell you that I've got a rifle?

47
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, too many guns.

48
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,844
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I have a .22 caliber rifle.

49
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:34,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Dad's going to take me out shooting, but I told him that I wanted my own handgun.

50
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,549
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing I have no interest in, unless it's a laser gun.

51
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:39,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Laser guns are alright.

52
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:41,662
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a very good point made.

53
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:51,609
[SPEAKER_09]: If everybody in the country could have a concealed weapon on them, even if they did or didn't, do you think someone's going to be likely to attack someone who could be armed?

54
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:57,013
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm still not a gun fan, but we're not going to talk politics tonight because we've got games to talk about.

55
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,194
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

56
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:03,377
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Ragnarok-tastic.

57
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I also played Final Fantasy VI while I had jury duty last week.

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's guns in Ragnarok.

59
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:11,083
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

60
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:37,212
[SPEAKER_09]: So I played some of that at, well, I had jury duty and I was very pissed off that I was one alternate away from getting on the trial.

61
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:40,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was like a little three-day criminal trial and I was looking forward to it.

62
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:45,875
[SPEAKER_09]: So I didn't get on the trial, disappointment, blah, blah, cry, cry, wham.

63
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, you don't get to do your civic duty.

64
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:49,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you kind of did, but you know what I mean.

65
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but I met some cool people and watched the Olympics, which was kind of eh.

66
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:03,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And then really that's about all I played, except for playing a lot of Solitaire on my iPhone.

67
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have Michael Phelps fever?

68
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:11,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this has nothing to do with video games, but at the same time he'll probably have a game or something named after him in the future.

69
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:19,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not, but I did go looking at pictures on the interwebs today of people kissing during the Olympics, and there was a guy kissing his horse.

70
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:22,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

71
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,774
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

72
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:06,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm armed and dangerous.

73
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:07,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got two of them.

74
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:09,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm armed and fabulous.

75
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:16,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I have my humerus and my radius.

76
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:17,859
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

77
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, tell us something about your gaming week.

78
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I have biceps brachii, too.

79
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,823
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't involve guns or Michael Phelps.

80
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:28,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can guarantee one of the two of those.

81
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:31,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Phelps sucks.

82
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:33,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope to God they don't make a game.

83
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:42,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really, how exciting... Send that hate mail to Loki at OrangeLawnRadio.com How exciting could a game be that's all swimming?

84
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:46,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... Swimming and Wii Sports 2.

85
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:47,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait for it.

86
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:50,339
[SPEAKER_02]: The Olympic Games are boring enough.

87
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:56,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the game as in the actual Olympics, but the games made about the Olympics.

88
00:06:56,481 --> 00:07:01,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are boring, let alone just cutting out all the other events that you might find exciting and just leaving swimming in there.

89
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:07,584
[SPEAKER_03]: See, call me sick, but the things I like about the Olympics, I don't really like the dream stories about Michael Phelps.

90
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:08,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, great swimmer and all.

91
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:10,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to knock him, but...

92
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,726
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the stuff that's boring to me.

93
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:14,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the crazy stuff.

94
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:16,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the craziness that happens in the Olympics.

95
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:20,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the weightlifter who had to get the paramedics called in on him.

96
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And Frisbee in chat says, who saw the Cuban guy get mad and kick the ref?

97
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:26,854
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the kind of stuff I love about the Olympics.

98
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:29,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the guy that bit the guy in the shoulder, the boxer.

99
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,696
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jerry Springer stuff you won't see on NBC.

100
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:36,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have Blue on your friends list on LiveJournal?

101
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:38,704
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sadly I do not.

102
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:47,009
[SPEAKER_09]: He posted a translation of an article that I thought was a really sweet article, and I want to mention it real quick, about the South Korean women's handball team.

103
00:07:49,531 --> 00:08:07,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they were already going to win the bronze, but their coach called a timeout right before and put in all the old players, not old, but older players, that this would be their last Olympics, so that they could be in the winning match and all be the ones to take home the medal.

104
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:07,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

105
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:10,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they wouldn't be able to do another Olympics.

106
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,968
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of them were housewives and their children were watching.

107
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:22,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he put, I think, four people that would have to retire after this Olympics in the match for the last few minutes of the game.

108
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:24,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be fucking pissed.

109
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:26,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it that all Olympic video games usually suck?

110
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:30,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't remember playing an Olympics video game thinking, wow, that was awesome.

111
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,103
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

112
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:33,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's a lot of Olympic video games that are kind of crappy.

113
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Because none of the crazy stuff happens in the video game.

114
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:36,345
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, I think that's a darn good explanation.

115
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,565
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't get that crazy stuff happening.

116
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:40,266
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more craziness.

117
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:46,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And whoever's developing London 2012 for, you know, next-gen consoles, make it happen.

118
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:47,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a crazy.

119
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:48,248
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm sorry.

120
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming week, my bad.

121
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:50,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

122
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the games I play... Sorry.

123
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:59,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Joshi16 says, Someone should put Michael Phelps in place of Echo the Dolphin.

124
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:00,154
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.

125
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:02,056
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.

126
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:02,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd play that.

127
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:03,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Phelps the Dolphin.

128
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:04,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, Frisbee.

129
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:05,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sorry.

130
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLawsRadio.com if you want to join this.

131
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:08,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael the Phelps.

132
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:09,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

133
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:10,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

134
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:16,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So I play basically Bionic Commando Rearmed, which is awesome, and I love Bionic Commando.

135
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:21,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much the game is as frustrating as the original, which is fine.

136
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:25,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, I enjoy it quite a bit.

137
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:30,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played more Grand Theft Auto 4, because that's what I do.

138
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:34,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just have to address this because I have had a lot of people...

139
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:36,164
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

140
00:09:56,016 --> 00:10:11,409
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've tried to get other people in there but they don't want outside people playing so sorry but in the evening you have to set up certain hours exactly and I'm not trying to be rude and I would love to type back to you but I'm limited on time and

141
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:15,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Typing on the fucking Xbox controller sucks.

142
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:19,980
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get a light-up USB keyboard like mine.

143
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the chatpad.

144
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:24,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it at home, but I don't have it at work.

145
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:26,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have a headset at work either, so I can't tell you no.

146
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:30,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

147
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:37,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, I meant to download Galaga Legions because that looked kind of cool, but I never did.

148
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just not going to.

149
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I am highly looking forward to this week though with the release of Castle Crashers.

150
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:47,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, it's going to be awesome.

151
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:49,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'll be playing.

152
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're not pumping something up for disappointment.

153
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:57,388
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I have no feelings whatsoever about Castle Crashers.

154
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:02,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Alien Hominid is pretty awesome and Castle Crashers, just all the video looks freaking awesome.

155
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:03,975
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

156
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:04,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say this.

157
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:11,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though this was sent over a private message, and I usually don't encourage people to send me chat comments over a private message because it's a bit overwhelming, this is pretty funny.

158
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:17,687
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw, going on the Olympic thing, said, What about the one female water polo player who had her breasts exposed all over the net?

159
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:20,129
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another good example of the dark side.

160
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:21,650
[SPEAKER_03]: How did I miss that?

161
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, because it's water polo, and I would never watch it.

162
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:27,756
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm thinking, you know, I could go for some boobs in my Olympic games.

163
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:28,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, DarkSakura?

164
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:28,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

165
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:30,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking on the internet right now.

166
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:36,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what we were talking about, because obviously when we were watching the Olympics, you have to heckle it because it's fun.

167
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:43,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were watching men's diving, and I was like, wouldn't it be awesome if... Now, that's a sport I'll watch.

168
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:51,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't it be awesome if those diving boards had some sort of pneumatic thing on them that launched them into the air really high?

169
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:53,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that would be fucking awesome.

170
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:57,137
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing like, you know, ten somersaults in the air and stuff.

171
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:57,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

172
00:11:58,772 --> 00:11:59,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wouldn't watch that?

173
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:03,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have BMX bike racing in this Olympics.

174
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not really an Olympic sport.

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a little Betty Hill style gag.

176
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:10,612
[SPEAKER_03]: G-Squared68 asks if you're talking about the man cannon.

177
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,119
[SPEAKER_02]: from Halo.

178
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:38,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

179
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,280
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they need to have, a man cannon.

180
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,162
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be an Olympic event, man cannon.

181
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:43,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Man cannon, I like that.

182
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:46,155
[SPEAKER_03]: and Woman Cannon.

183
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I smell a new list list or something like that.

184
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:53,817
[SPEAKER_02]: A new dream game?

185
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:56,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an expansion upon the dream games.

186
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:57,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an Olympic event.

187
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,898
[SPEAKER_02]: No, a list list.

188
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:01,218
[SPEAKER_03]: The Olympic events that you'd want to see.

189
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,359
[SPEAKER_03]: We might have to do that in the near future.

190
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:09,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can convince Bobby to do a live list list at PAX somehow when we're there for the panel, which we'll talk more about in a little while.

191
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on though, anything else in your gaming week you want to share, Loki?

192
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:14,822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all that I remember.

193
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I actually haven't played a lot new this week.

194
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:28,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a very busy personal life this week, and I don't feel right basing reviews off demos alone, but I will say I did at least play the demos for Force Unleashed, which I enjoyed.

195
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:33,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some reservations about the full game, but I'll check out the full game and see if that carries over.

196
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:37,857
[SPEAKER_03]: But I enjoyed myself more than I thought I would for a 3D action game, which usually isn't my kind of thing.

197
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even that into Star Wars either, but I, you know...

198
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the Apprentice guy, Starkiller or whatever his name is, and Soulcalibur, and I thought, what the hell, I'll check out Force Unleashed, it might be fun.

199
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:50,905
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

200
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:51,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

201
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:56,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I also checked out the new Galaga game on Xbox Live, the Galaga Legions, the new souped up one.

202
00:13:57,188 --> 00:13:58,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a lot of fun with the demo for that one.

203
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:02,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably will end up upgrading to the full version and tell you more about it later.

204
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:07,414
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was very pleased that it's much faster paced than the old Galaga games.

205
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:07,814
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

206
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:34,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but the other big game that's been going on in our house, though, was Bionic Commando.

207
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:35,484
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

208
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:36,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I checked that out, too.

209
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:37,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I did download that.

210
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:37,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, made it easy.

211
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:39,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played enough of it yet.

212
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to review it yet, but I'm having fun with it.

213
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:44,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really enjoy the new soundtrack, I've got to say.

214
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy with that.

215
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:49,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryoma in chat says, I destroy it, Galaga.

216
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:50,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

217
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:51,294
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

218
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:57,337
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, and now representing the USA in the 1,000 meter man cannon, Rob Roberts.

219
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

220
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:06,696
[SPEAKER_03]: and Gerardimo in chat says Pac-Man Championship Edition is to Pac-Man as Galaga Legions is to our type.

221
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:09,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of true.

222
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,961
[SPEAKER_03]: The Galaga Legions isn't really a lot like Galaga at all, actually.

223
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:13,842
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's fun.

224
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:15,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a really good time playing it.

225
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:20,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking it was going to be too much like Geometry Wars and we just had that a few weeks ago, but it's different enough.

226
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:22,488
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

227
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:38,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Allgames.com Allgames.com

228
00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:26,513
[SPEAKER_03]: but we'll also be doing our own stuff and we haven't exactly decided what we're doing I know there will be video involved to some extent because we want to shoot some video from the floor so we'll be showing you some things via our YouTube channel and giving you updates via our brand new Twitter which I also wanted to mention we have a brand new Twitter at twitter.com the username very easy OLR is our Twitter name so follow us on Twitter we'll be giving you updates from the floor letting you know what to expect and a couple podcasts from PAX as well it'll be fun

229
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys getting excited about PAX?

230
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:31,392
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys most looking forward to at PAX?

231
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:35,413
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, the networking.

232
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to meet other podcasters because a whole crap load of them are going to be there.

233
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:43,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just in the All Games Network, but other indie podcasters.

234
00:16:43,434 --> 00:16:44,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to the networking.

235
00:16:44,815 --> 00:16:47,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see which celebrity I bump into this year.

236
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:48,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at E3.

237
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:48,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

238
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:55,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to smack Konami upside their head because, seriously, I don't know what they're doing.

239
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:56,124
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not showing it, Pax.

240
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:57,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good.

241
00:16:57,364 --> 00:17:00,446
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have anything to show.

242
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:08,710
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, if you guys want to meet us, we'll be around the show floor and most certainly at the All Games broadcast going on right by the Sumo Lounge.

243
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:14,293
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow, let's move on and talk about... I plugged the Twitter, I plugged Penny Arcade Expo.

244
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:15,394
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be playing a promo...

245
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:16,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

246
00:17:36,883 --> 00:18:00,991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically kind of a homemade version of the game, attacking the Twin Towers, and it has some sort of interactive elements with it where people can actually put their hand over this railing that's near the exhibit, and it will fire bullets up at the screen, killing the space invaders, but, you know, it's pretty much impossible to win, so the towers always get destroyed.

247
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:06,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently people, you know, are like, too soon, too soon, so...

248
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:08,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

249
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:10,509
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

250
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:28,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically the Games Convention press release calls the installation an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy and a social tale that can be related to historical tales without losing its poetic power.

251
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:30,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.

252
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:33,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like art fluff.

253
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Artsy speak.

254
00:18:34,674 --> 00:18:35,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know...

255
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:36,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

256
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I will give you my opinion here in just a second, but there's some more.

257
00:18:41,265 --> 00:19:04,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So, because this happened, of course, the news got back to Taito, who responded by saying that they had no idea that this sort of thing was going on, and of course, they obviously did not license Space Invaders for them to use, and they're going to take legal actions against the person who infringed upon their

258
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:06,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Trademark.

259
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:08,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

260
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:10,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But then what happened, Loki?

261
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:16,284
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the artist who put it up there decided to pull it.

262
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:30,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, after three days of steady downward spiral in the public discussion of the piece, I have just given my agreement to the organizers of Leipzig Games Convention to simply turn off the installation Invaders.

263
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,123
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, you know.

264
00:19:33,143 --> 00:19:35,264
[SPEAKER_03]: He had quite the little manifesto posted.

265
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it wasn't quite, it was a manifesto.

266
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:57,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's all, contrary to previous reports, I am American and it saddens me that people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside some obscure but tactically understood criteria of purely, um, let's see, uh, I have no idea what the hell he's trying to say here.

267
00:19:58,803 --> 00:19:59,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, whatever.

268
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:00,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, uh,

269
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:03,536
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

270
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Fancy talk.

271
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:04,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

272
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:09,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think it's retarded that they took it down.

273
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, you can interpret it in many ways.

274
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:25,867
[SPEAKER_02]: One, you can interpret it as, I think, based on the fact that people can interact with it and actually fire bullets from the bottom of the screen, it's kind of invoking, like,

275
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:31,971
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, I know you have strong opinions on this because I heard you on Bobby's show.

276
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:34,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you typing it in chat now.

277
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:34,793
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

278
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:53,164
[SPEAKER_09]: People need to learn to be offended.

279
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:56,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop being a goddamn whiny bitch.

280
00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:58,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the stick out of your ass and deal with it.

281
00:20:58,828 --> 00:20:59,629
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the end of the story.

282
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:00,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

283
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,250
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't like it.

284
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Boo fucking hoo, okay?

285
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:05,073
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like having to go to work, but guess what?

286
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:05,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta.

287
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:11,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like hearing, you know, my husband yell at playing Grand Theft Auto 4, but guess what?

288
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:12,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta.

289
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:13,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I married him.

290
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:13,659
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my choice.

291
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,700
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you...

292
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:22,046
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to live in a country where you've got free speech, stay in America.

293
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:22,806
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got it.

294
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:24,187
[SPEAKER_09]: May as well flaunt it.

295
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:28,611
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't want your free speech, by all means, move to North Korea or something.

296
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:40,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that if you want to be free to express your freedom of speech, you also need to let other people be free to express theirs.

297
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:42,763
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do not like it, shut the fuck up.

298
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:43,744
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what your blog is for.

299
00:21:44,488 --> 00:22:08,972
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe if you didn't like it and you just probably didn't understand the piece and maybe if you asked the artist what he meant by it there you go but then again at the same time but at the same time though I kind of get from this you know artist or whatever he was just trying to invoke a reaction I'm sorry that's not an excuse for art no that's what art is to be for if you do a piece and no one reacts to it you have failed as an artist

300
00:22:09,574 --> 00:22:15,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that just making an artistic piece just to get a reaction is considered art.

301
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:25,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you think about it, if I paint a painting that I want people to think is sad, if I invoke a sad reaction, then yes, mission accomplished for me.

302
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:28,595
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I paint a painting that's just

303
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:32,773
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, offensive, and people get offended by it, I don't know.

304
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:41,915
[SPEAKER_09]: That was your purpose, that's why you did the art, but the whole thing is that if people's comfort zones are not pushed, if people are not challenged to think, they're not going to.

305
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:45,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna, you know, cause a very stagnant society.

306
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:54,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, even think about, you know, some of the greatest artists of their time were so unappreciated in their time, told that their work was crap, yet, you know...

307
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:58,022
[SPEAKER_09]: years after they've died, they're now considered masterpieces.

308
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:01,186
[SPEAKER_09]: They're considered the geniuses of their age, the innovators.

309
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:07,213
[SPEAKER_09]: If we didn't have people that challenge the way that people think, then there would be, I think, no cultural progression.

310
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,494
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what this is about.

311
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:12,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the problem comes down to that it's space invaders and not geometry wars.

312
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:20,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I have an opinion on this too, which is I kind of like mostly agree.

313
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:20,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my thing.

314
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:23,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I mostly agree because I'm all for free speech.

315
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:25,020
[SPEAKER_03]: That's this country we live in.

316
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,102
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy has a right to do – even though he's exhibiting in Germany, whatever.

317
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:31,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I still support he has a right to say what he wants to say.

318
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:36,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally may go, that wasn't very smart, and I might go –

319
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:43,730
[SPEAKER_03]: The price you pay for expression is people disagreeing with you and going to be expressing their opinion in return.

320
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,651
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of part of it.

321
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:53,256
[SPEAKER_03]: If you open yourself up for that with your art, then you're going to get it back at you.

322
00:23:53,657 --> 00:23:54,377
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing.

323
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:56,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually understand why Taito's pissed.

324
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:58,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now I agree.

325
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:02,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Pulling it because of the licensing issue, I agree with that.

326
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:05,715
[SPEAKER_09]: He did use their licensed material without permission.

327
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:06,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and here's the thing.

328
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:19,149
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not so much that I think Taito had a right to do it because of what is going on, but because people are so ignorant when they see this, they are going to think, oh, Taito or Space Invaders endorsed this, or this is a...

329
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:32,559
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all this ignorant crap that's out there in the media about video games that people like Jack Voldemort just perpetuate this whole thing.

330
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand why Taito's pissed.

331
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:43,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the guy made a bad judgment in that regard where maybe he should have done something similar yet different.

332
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:43,648
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

333
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:47,190
[SPEAKER_09]: If he was going to invoke such emotion.

334
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:48,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Parody is legal.

335
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:50,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Parody is legal.

336
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:54,514
[SPEAKER_09]: If we didn't have parody being legal, we would have no Jonathan Colton or Weird Al.

337
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:55,474
[SPEAKER_09]: End of story.

338
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:10,079
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also, I think that he should have been a little, especially as an artist, he should have recognized the difference between, you know, stealing somebody else's intellectual property and done something.

339
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,299
[SPEAKER_09]: He could have used the concept.

340
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how many video games do we have out there with, you know, aliens invading Earth's chute?

341
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Die, Aliens, Bang Bang.

342
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:20,223
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we've got a ton of games of those, so it wouldn't be any time of trouble.

343
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:20,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm offended.

344
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:21,704
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why I'm offended?

345
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:22,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I love aliens.

346
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And aliens are creatures, too.

347
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:28,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Aliens are creatures of the great god of the universe.

348
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:33,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm offended by these games where we just haphazardly kill aliens who only come in peace.

349
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:36,190
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hear something really ironic about this whole story?

350
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,670
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

351
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And that I'm sure that they didn't realize?

352
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:48,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week on the Japanese WiiWare service Space Invaders Get Even will be released.

353
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,651
[SPEAKER_09]: That is great.

354
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:53,771
[SPEAKER_02]: The space invaders will destroy buildings.

355
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:56,552
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Rampage with aliens.

356
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:57,032
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

357
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:57,512
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing.

358
00:25:57,692 --> 00:26:07,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you there are tons of paintings out there that depict the events of 9-11, a horrific tragedy in American times in very controversial ways.

359
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:11,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet there are tons of paintings out there and books and newspapers and movies.

360
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:18,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But the funny thing is the media is never going to show that to you because they love to pick on video games.

361
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:20,058
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Taito's pissed.

362
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:45,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaoran in chat says, I'm offended by games where you kill monsters.

363
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:47,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I know plenty of monsters and they're not all like that.

364
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:48,855
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an unfair stereotype.

365
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:50,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a monster activist.

366
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:50,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Hear me roar.

367
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:54,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, look, we have a new segment on our show.

368
00:26:54,677 --> 00:26:57,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It's involving our new Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

369
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And we invite you guys to respond to...

370
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

371
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:21,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Offensive, kind of, but there have been other stuff that have also done this.

372
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:29,919
[SPEAKER_03]: See, for me, I respect what you're saying, dude, but 9-11 did happen.

373
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,820
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just something we all kind of have to deal with.

374
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,601
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

375
00:27:32,661 --> 00:27:33,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

376
00:27:33,561 --> 00:27:35,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird statement to me.

377
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:39,364
[SPEAKER_03]: PodCulture says a bit too soon for stuff like that.

378
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:39,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 70!

379
00:27:41,972 --> 00:27:48,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin says, I think it was pretty tasteless and the guy was obviously going for press via controversy despite his insistence that he wasn't.

380
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Cananogram says, I think that it was a risky move by the artist.

381
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:55,276
[SPEAKER_03]: He must have known that he would piss people off, but he has the right to show it.

382
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:55,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Yum.

383
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,617
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, I don't blame Taito for wanting to distance themselves from something so controversial.

384
00:28:00,677 --> 00:28:01,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about bad PR.

385
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:03,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly what I'm saying, yo.

386
00:28:03,658 --> 00:28:09,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ranma, as a New Yorker that lives here and works two blocks from Ground Zero, it doesn't bother me, really.

387
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people need to get their heads out of their asses.

388
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:12,852
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

389
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments from our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

390
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:32,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I just remember reading just how, you know, in fact, I honestly think that the biggest, you know, if people are so worried about, you know, recovery and about moving past it, then that's what they actually need to be doing, you know, recovering, moving past it, business as usual.

391
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:34,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of the ideas of people who laugh at funerals.

392
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:39,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because sometimes that's the best way to deal with it is to laugh at it.

393
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:54,869
[SPEAKER_09]: And forgive me for being a little philosophical about this, but if their whole point of running airplanes into the buildings was to shake our morale and to weaken us, wouldn't the biggest slap in their face back would be to go back to business as usual?

394
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,317
[SPEAKER_03]: We welcome your comments.

395
00:28:57,357 --> 00:29:00,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have further comments on the issue.

396
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:02,020
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

397
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure there's a lot of people with very differing opinions on that.

398
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:07,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to some more gaming news tonight, though.

399
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:09,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to talk a lot about music games.

400
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:14,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this game will not be coming to Xbox Live, this whole Space Invaders controversial thing.

401
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:15,866
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what is?

402
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:17,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Beat & Groovy Beat & Groovy

403
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:42,170
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, poppin' music looks like it is making its way to Xbox Live Arcade as beat and groovy.

404
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:50,855
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead of having a pop music controller, because obviously you can't get one of those through Xbox Live Arcade, instead you will be hitting five different colored buttons.

405
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:53,677
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all different colors, purple, blue, red, green, yellow.

406
00:29:54,157 --> 00:30:03,322
[SPEAKER_03]: You use left arrow, up arrow, right arrow or X, Y or B, I'm sorry, Y or A, and then B, or kind of like the different buttons.

407
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:05,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I should buy my poppin' music controller.

408
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:06,525
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

409
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:23,183
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Taka, La La More, We Two Are One, Good Cool, Gotta Get My Groove On

410
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:50,760
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, you would know these guys Orange Lounge with the 100 second kitchen battle also supposed to be in this Loki, what do you think?

411
00:30:50,820 --> 00:31:12,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's retarded no, seriously they had an opportunity to bring over a game that some of the fans were looking for and what they tried to do the problem with Konami they're trying to bring on new people into their music games, I guess they're trying to appeal to different people

412
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:19,204
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, these type of games are bought by a certain group of people.

413
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:23,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you try to appeal to other people, they're not going to buy it.

414
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:33,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And I heard a rumor that pretty much those songs that you see on there, those seven songs, I think there was two more, that's it.

415
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:35,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure there will be download things.

416
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,177
[SPEAKER_01]: What if this is a testing round?

417
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:37,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be.

418
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid, though, because, I mean...

419
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:42,638
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

420
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:00,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

421
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:01,546
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't Rock Revolution.

422
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:03,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they don't know what they're doing.

423
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:04,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments from chat.

424
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:10,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Gsquared68 says, If it has Vic Viper as a character, maybe I might get a 360.

425
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:17,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Our ever-faithful webmaster VXJSXV says, I can't believe they kept poppin' music songs in the song list.

426
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:23,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I am kind of surprised that it's at least a bit of an authentic song list, all things considered, if this game is being targeted for the US as well.

427
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting, but of course very cheap for them too.

428
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And KatamarisForever says, Poppin' music should have more pop.

429
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:30,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Avril Lavigne, Leona Lewis

430
00:32:55,603 --> 00:33:01,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Release it here and you also add songs that people that may not be used to poppin' music would like.

431
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:08,528
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like licensed songs or just songs that are really cool that kind of appeal that aren't necessarily poppin' music types of music.

432
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:13,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Same should have been done with Rock Revolution.

433
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:17,712
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have put some of the Bomani songs in there.

434
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:22,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I understand that Bomani songs may not translate well

435
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:23,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

436
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me try reading a couple more comments from chat here.

437
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:50,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo has a very long comment here, but it's pretty good.

438
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:58,028
[SPEAKER_03]: My problem right now is that people were bitching that Konami needed to Americanize their music games, but their hardcore fans got pissy because they wanted to keep in Konami songs.

439
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:04,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So Konami is trying to appeal to American audience by making it less cute to appeal to Americans, but still rewarding their hardcore fans.

440
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:08,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, yes, they took out the controller, but perhaps they're just trying to test it.

441
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:11,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And then SSJ100Matt says, put ABBA in there.

442
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:12,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'll work.

443
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:13,639
[SPEAKER_03]: ABBA will make it all better.

444
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

445
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:18,818
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, again, I'm going to withhold judgment until I actually play the game.

446
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think it might be a little bit of a water testing thing, but I don't know.

447
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say I'm not getting my expectations very high, but I'd love to have Konami folks come on the show and talk about the game.

448
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:30,465
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be very interesting.

449
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:31,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we shall see.

450
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:38,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're looking for a seven-button controller, you remember that they are releasing a drum pad that has seven inputs on it.

451
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, too bad this game only uses five.

452
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:45,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually it uses 7 because you can use the two trigger buttons for the 7.

453
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:47,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

454
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:48,654
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see when it comes out.

455
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:52,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, shall I continue?

456
00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:52,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

457
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:59,582
[SPEAKER_09]: There is another peripheral that's going to be coming out for Guitar Hero 4, but Neversoft isn't saying what it is.

458
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:10,988
[SPEAKER_09]: The speculation, though, is that it's either going to be some type of keyboard or a turntable because this is stated to work more specifically with the studio mode.

459
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:13,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of think of a mixing board.

460
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:17,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be surprised to see a mixing board.

461
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:18,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

462
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:23,275
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people have speculated keyboard because that's like the obvious thing, but that would be interesting, a mixing board, like Kraken DJ.

463
00:35:24,315 --> 00:35:24,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't that be cool?

464
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:26,817
[SPEAKER_09]: They do that and then they actually release Kraken DJ.

465
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:27,337
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be sweet.

466
00:35:28,348 --> 00:35:29,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

467
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't Kraken DJ a Sega thing?

468
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:32,649
[SPEAKER_09]: It was indeed.

469
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:37,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Or perhaps they could stop releasing peripherals.

470
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:41,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, four peripherals for this fucking game.

471
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:47,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, it will probably be great, but seriously, it's a little overkill.

472
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:54,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people are really enthusiastic about making their songs and stuff like that.

473
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:59,067
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're totally in a penis envy war with Rock Band and all those folks right now.

474
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:00,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

475
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,111
[SPEAKER_02]: They could try to get a jump on it, I guess.

476
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:04,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Release all the peripherals you want.

477
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:05,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I just won't buy them.

478
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:08,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever.

479
00:36:10,078 --> 00:36:13,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, there's going to be some pretty cool stuff coming out for...

480
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:19,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirty Little Secret by the All-American Rejects Crush Crush Crush by Paramore

481
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:45,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The Takeover, The Breaks Over from Fall Out Boy, The Pretender from Foo Fighters, and Smashing Pumpkins with Tarantula.

482
00:36:46,443 --> 00:37:01,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they also have the 2000s with Linkin Park One Step Closer, Can't Stop by Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Middle with Jimmy Eat World, and I Can't Believe in Things Called Love by The Darkness, and many more.

483
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:04,630
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to basically have different decades to go along with all this.

484
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:05,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

485
00:37:06,531 --> 00:37:10,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much the game is going to be exactly like Guitar Hero on tour.

486
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:18,554
[SPEAKER_02]: They've just kind of tweaked a few things including before where they'd have you sign autographs and sign different things.

487
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:22,715
[SPEAKER_02]: You're signing wristbands and stuff like that.

488
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:23,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

489
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:25,576
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of the same, just different track list.

490
00:37:27,096 --> 00:37:28,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like all the music games.

491
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:29,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Much like all the other Guitar Hero games have been lately.

492
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:35,718
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they need to add new peripherals because they're starting to just feel like the same damn game over and over again.

493
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:37,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what it is, I don't know.

494
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:48,556
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this isn't a show role, but I heard rumors also that, or I should say I read rumors, that they were talking about doing yet another peripheral for a Tony Hawk game on the DS.

495
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:52,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, stop making... On the DS?

496
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,199
[SPEAKER_02]: On the DS.

497
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:54,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a fingerboard?

498
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly a fingerboard, or possibly... They were suggesting that maybe it's like...

499
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:08,822
[SPEAKER_02]: There was that mag game that they had where you basically would slide the DS around, kind of like a motion sensor almost.

500
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:09,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

501
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:09,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

502
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:11,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still retarded, though.

503
00:38:11,543 --> 00:38:15,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop releasing games with peripherals.

504
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:17,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys remember those fingerboards from back in the day?

505
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:23,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I was in high school, they actually had those little things on keychains, and you actually used your fingers to move this little thing around.

506
00:38:23,408 --> 00:38:25,609
[SPEAKER_03]: You did little tricks, like they had little miniature ramps.

507
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:27,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember you having one of those.

508
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:29,119
[SPEAKER_03]: DDRonlineCommunity.com

509
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:56,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution X

510
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:26,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Brand new remixes, 2008 X-edits of Butterfly and Dubby Dub.

511
00:39:27,272 --> 00:39:28,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Dubby Dub?

512
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:29,652
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably know this.

513
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:33,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're basically just recutting the song.

514
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:34,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look like a remix.

515
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,674
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just taking a different portion.

516
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:42,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it says, enjoy the familiar, impossible-to-resist melody while exploring the fresh new arrangement.

517
00:39:43,336 --> 00:39:45,617
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been reworked exclusively for DDRX.

518
00:39:46,357 --> 00:39:47,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Black and White by Michael Jackson Tootsie Roll

519
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:16,684
[SPEAKER_03]: That song's awesome.

520
00:40:17,085 --> 00:40:20,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I Want Candy, Bust a Move, Obsession.

521
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:21,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was kind of interesting.

522
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:24,928
[SPEAKER_03]: The old synth pop song you still hear at goth clubs until today.

523
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Call on Me.

524
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:28,630
[SPEAKER_03]: But this one I thought was most interesting.

525
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelly Furtado's All Good Things Come to an End.

526
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:33,373
[SPEAKER_03]: They've remade that as a dance classic.

527
00:40:33,393 --> 00:40:36,794
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, if they can do that to Lips of an Angel, why not do it to that song too?

528
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:40,736
[SPEAKER_03]: That's DDR Hottest Party 2 coming to the Nintendo Wii a little later this year.

529
00:40:40,756 --> 00:40:42,797
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one of those tracks on DDRX.

530
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say what it was, number four.

531
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:49,163
[SPEAKER_02]: That song was awesome.

532
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:53,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an awesome remix of another song from DDR.

533
00:40:53,288 --> 00:40:55,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I was going to mention, though, this is a cool title for a song.

534
00:40:57,092 --> 00:41:01,236
[SPEAKER_02]: The 30 Lives Up Up Down Dance Mix.

535
00:41:01,957 --> 00:41:02,497
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

536
00:41:02,998 --> 00:41:05,000
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a pretty good name for a dinner song.

537
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:05,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

538
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:18,191
[SPEAKER_03]: ddronlinecommunity.com if you want to see a list of songs coming to your DDR games later this year and I'm sure it's just a matter of time before we start talking about Universe 3 and who knows what else in the DDR franchise on into 2009

539
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:21,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Samba de Amigo Samba de Amigo

540
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:42,573
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other good thing about it is that they're actually talking about download content.

541
00:41:42,994 --> 00:41:43,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

542
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:51,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that, the Wii exclusive track list, if you are ready for this.

543
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:53,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

544
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:57,364
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Byla Mae by Gypsy Kings, and I love Gypsy Kings.

545
00:41:58,084 --> 00:41:59,765
[SPEAKER_09]: They do a really good cover of Hotel California.

546
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Papa Loves Mambo, Mambo No.

547
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:03,828
[SPEAKER_09]: 8, sorry.

548
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:08,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Konga, Miami Style Machine, Lowrider, Mambo No. 5...

549
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:12,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Oye Como Va by Santana

550
00:42:26,604 --> 00:42:43,433
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some previously returning tracks like Tub Thumping, The Cup of Life, Samba de Janeiro, Bomboleo, Take on Me, the Real Big Fish version, Tequila, Soul Bossa Nova.

551
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:49,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Downloadable tracks are Mambo Mambo and I Want Candy and Are You Going to Be My Girl.

552
00:42:50,597 --> 00:42:55,862
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool that some of the songs from the old school Samba de Migo are coming back, like the Real Big Fish take on me.

553
00:42:55,922 --> 00:42:58,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember that was in the Dreamcast.

554
00:42:58,504 --> 00:42:59,785
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a download song on the Dreamcast.

555
00:43:00,066 --> 00:43:01,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Although they weren't really downloads.

556
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:03,148
[SPEAKER_03]: They were pay to unlock.

557
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:03,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, they weren't pay.

558
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:04,950
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have to pay back then.

559
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,472
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just download to unlock.

560
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:11,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, though, that does give me this bad feeling, especially because we're talking about the Wii here.

561
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:14,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this going to be pay to unlock content?

562
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:17,120
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposedly not pay to unlock content.

563
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:17,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be good.

564
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:39,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is what's cool, is the Maracas controller are going to be that bright hot red, you know, and that you slip your, of course, one of them has a nunchuck attachment inside, and the other one is for your Wiimote attachment, and I'll be putting a picture of this up on the chat room.

565
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:46,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody say a big thank you to Sega for giving us the Maracas controller so this game feels right.

566
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Sega.

567
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Sega.

568
00:43:49,298 --> 00:43:51,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're licensed.

569
00:43:51,898 --> 00:43:54,919
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not licensed by Nintendo or something.

570
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, still, somebody got it out there one way or another.

571
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they make the little shaky shake noise.

572
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:02,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they do.

573
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:03,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

574
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:06,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And this game better still make you pose.

575
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:09,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Posing is the best part.

576
00:44:10,075 --> 00:44:10,655
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

577
00:44:10,675 --> 00:44:11,997
[SPEAKER_09]: We still need the tambourine game.

578
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:33,580
[SPEAKER_03]: at Penny Arcade Expo next week.

579
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,780
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one question I want to ask.

580
00:44:34,821 --> 00:44:35,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the tambourine game?

581
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:38,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to Sega.

582
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,484
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to the tambourine game.

583
00:44:41,524 --> 00:44:43,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's all bug them.

584
00:44:43,966 --> 00:44:51,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to say, because we had our games conference at work not last week, but the week before last.

585
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:57,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to say, Sega's lineup is probably one of the coolest lineups I've seen.

586
00:44:57,873 --> 00:44:59,234
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually kind of get it.

587
00:45:00,205 --> 00:45:01,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is surprising.

588
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that because there's been a couple years where they have not been getting it?

589
00:45:05,148 --> 00:45:06,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

590
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just Sonic stuff.

591
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,672
[SPEAKER_02]: They're putting out stuff.

592
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:12,493
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking risks, I guess.

593
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:19,058
[SPEAKER_02]: With Mad World, the House of Dead game that's coming out and stuff like that.

594
00:45:19,338 --> 00:45:20,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got to be picky in chat.

595
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:25,002
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, I will not say thank you to Sega until Shenmue 3 comes out.

596
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:33,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't hold your breath I want it to come out too, but don't hold your breath

597
00:45:34,669 --> 00:45:38,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft calls what happened this week at your work the Loki Zig Games Convention.

598
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:40,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it wasn't very exciting.

599
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:43,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to see people act like idiots, so that was fun.

600
00:45:44,232 --> 00:45:45,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, how about some release dates, Loki?

601
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:48,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel the world and look at release dates from around the world.

602
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:51,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this week we've got quite a bit of stuff coming out, actually.

603
00:45:52,395 --> 00:45:52,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Some good stuff.

604
00:45:53,596 --> 00:45:57,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off, we've got Commando Steel Disaster on the DS.

605
00:45:57,397 --> 00:46:00,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this game might not sound familiar to you guys, but...

606
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:03,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays exactly like Metal Slug.

607
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks kind of like Metal Slug.

608
00:46:06,461 --> 00:46:12,164
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely check it out if you're into the fast shooter games like Contra, Metal Slug.

609
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:14,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Worth checking out.

657
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:29,481

00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:06,079
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Driving Theory Training, I guess so you learn how to drive in theory from Atari.

718
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:09,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Ferrari Challenge on Wii.

719

724
00:53:29,861 --> 00:53:30,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

725
00:53:30,461 --> 00:53:31,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Busy week around the world.

726
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:32,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

727
00:53:32,261 --> 00:53:32,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy stuff.

728
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:37,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and we've got some quick mentions with more release dates.

729
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:42,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Not stuff coming out soon, but soon enough, I guess.

730
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:53,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Among other things, Fallout 3 was announced this week that it will be coming out on October 28th on PlayStation 3 and on the Xbox 360 as well as the Special Edition.

731
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:58,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And that should be as big as Oblivion, if not bigger.

732
00:53:59,186 --> 00:54:04,548
[SPEAKER_02]: This week on Hot Shots Golf, there was Kratos download content.

733
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:15,093
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually play as the God of War using the Clubs of Chaos in the golf game.

734
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:16,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's cute.

735
00:54:17,374 --> 00:54:18,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill Homecoming.

736
00:54:18,394 --> 00:54:20,155
[SPEAKER_02]: How much are they going to whore that guy out?

737
00:54:20,235 --> 00:54:20,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

738
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:24,178
[SPEAKER_02]: SILENT HILL HOMECOMING

739
00:54:45,603 --> 00:55:14,704
[SPEAKER_02]: barely in September I think it's on the 30th if I remember correctly and then Nintendo there's some Nintendo stuff announced or maybe not announced Wii Music slated for October 27th I can't imagine that's a really good date to release that but more power to them I guess Pokemon Ranger Shadows of Almia on the 10th of November and Animal Crossing City Folk

740
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:16,353
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

741
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:34,581
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not be coming with the WeSpeak microphone.

742
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:36,623
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have to buy that separately.

743
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:39,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And the microphone will cost you $29.99.

744
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a secret?

745
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not heard that.

746
00:55:43,387 --> 00:55:44,728
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like the first time I'm hearing this.

747
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:47,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's because no one knows about it yet.

748
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

749
00:55:49,131 --> 00:55:49,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

750
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:51,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's too bad.

751
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:56,556
[SPEAKER_02]: From a retail standpoint, that's good because then there won't be shortages on the game.

752
00:55:56,836 --> 00:55:57,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

753
00:55:58,938 --> 00:55:59,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

754
00:56:00,007 --> 00:56:02,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, thanks for the updates, Loki.

755
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Cananagram says it was already known, I think.

756
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,090
[SPEAKER_03]: So who knows?

757
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:14,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's one game that people are definitely anticipating, Final Fantasy XIII.

758
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:16,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question is, when is the demo coming?

759
00:56:16,734 --> 00:56:17,735
[SPEAKER_03]: When is the demo coming?

760
00:56:17,795 --> 00:56:19,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might have heard that there is a demo coming.

761
00:56:19,816 --> 00:56:21,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we talked about it a couple weeks ago.

762
00:56:21,517 --> 00:56:26,800
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming with the Final Fantasy Advent Children Blu-ray release, the complete version, which has the extra footage.

763
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the interesting thing.

764
00:56:28,161 --> 00:56:30,462
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being reported by IGN.

765
00:56:30,962 --> 00:56:43,147
[SPEAKER_03]: That apparently in Famitsu PS3 edition, apparently the director of Final Fantasy XIII, Motomo Toriyama, has said that it's going to be a two-hour demo.

766
00:56:43,928 --> 00:56:45,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a heck of a lot of demo.

767
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:50,651
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, quote, like the Final Fantasy VII demo that was included with PlayStation's ToeBall number one.

768
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:51,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be similar to that.

769
00:56:52,171 --> 00:56:55,413
[SPEAKER_03]: It will allow folks to experience the opening sequence and prologue.

770
00:56:55,973 --> 00:56:56,473
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

771
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:24,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very curious to see what this demo looks like.

772
00:57:24,391 --> 00:57:28,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not surprised they're saying it's two hours, but I still think there's people that are going to blast right through it.

773
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:33,120
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's probably one of those things where there might be a lot of hidden depth to it, and you can milk two hours out of it.

774
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,382
[SPEAKER_03]: But I imagine most people will burn through it in an hour.

775
00:57:36,394 --> 00:57:37,555
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

776
00:57:56,138 --> 00:58:20,207
[SPEAKER_09]: well for people who are fans of Street Fighter 4 that is actually I do believe just recently had a console version announced there is going to be Cammy in the game so she will be included in the console release of Street Fighter 4 and that makes people happy because they like to see her butt crack who doesn't?

777
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:25,389
[SPEAKER_02]: um no answer alright um

778
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:28,791
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

779
00:58:46,743 --> 00:58:52,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand where the mouse input is coming from because I don't see any sort of touchpad or anything.

780
00:58:52,626 --> 00:58:57,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're having you rub your fingers over the letters, I don't know.

781
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,172
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting, kind of cool.

782
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:08,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It snaps to the joystick much like, I don't know, the chatpad.

783
00:59:09,177 --> 00:59:13,720
[SPEAKER_02]: But this time, instead of being below the actual controller, it's above it.

784
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

785
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:27,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And other things that it will feature, quick keys for your friends lists and for your messages as well as the ability to type and all that fun stuff.

786
00:59:28,751 --> 00:59:32,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting that the PS3 has been compared a lot of times to a computer.

787
00:59:33,499 --> 00:59:35,220
[SPEAKER_03]: ActDeft in chat says, Sony, we don't innovate, we imitate.

788
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:39,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought that was kind of Microsoft's thing, is that, you know, anything you can do, I can do better.

789
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:40,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

790
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:40,803
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's innovating.

791
01:00:03,843 --> 01:00:05,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's true when you make it better.

792
01:00:05,965 --> 01:00:07,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sony has been playing a lot of catch-up, though.

793
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:09,108
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

794
01:00:09,148 --> 01:00:10,770
[SPEAKER_03]: This mouse thing is kind of neat, I guess.

795
01:00:12,271 --> 01:00:13,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is good, though.

796
01:00:13,973 --> 01:00:16,255
[SPEAKER_03]: What better on the PlayStation 3 than something free?

797
01:00:16,975 --> 01:00:17,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And we like free things.

798
01:00:18,016 --> 01:00:20,298
[SPEAKER_03]: The only bad news for us is that it's happening in Europe.

799
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:23,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, we still have some friends overseas that listen to our show.

800
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:23,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

801
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,721
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are getting something called VidZone.

802
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:29,263
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something for the PS3 that involves music videos.

803
01:00:29,323 --> 01:00:32,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a streaming music video service that's going to be launching on the PlayStation 3.

804
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:36,006
[SPEAKER_03]: The trial of this whole thing is supposed to be starting in early 2009.

805
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:39,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be taking place in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

806
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:47,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Vidzone will include a full playlist of videos from hip-hop to punk, heavy metal, and classics.

807
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:49,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll actually be able to build your own playlist.

808
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:55,734
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download songs and music videos and ringtones, but some of that might actually end up costing you.

809
01:00:56,074 --> 01:01:05,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So while I guess it'll probably be free to maybe watch some of the videos on demand and stuff, if you actually want to take away the ringtones or download the songs, that's going to cost you a little bit of money.

810
01:01:05,557 --> 01:01:07,418
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, though, now this is kind of cool.

811
01:01:08,218 --> 01:01:36,550
[SPEAKER_03]: it will do the whole remote play thing so if you download a music video you can put it on your PSP so like if there's a music video that you just like have to have with you on the go you can do that so you know that's and that's one of Sony's strengths right now is that they've built a really good relationship between the PS3 and the PSP for those that own both so that that does sound kind of cool I got to admit I mean how neat would it be to see say you know oh there's this great new song oh wait you haven't heard it oh here I got it on my PSP you know kind of neat

812
01:01:37,133 --> 01:01:38,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So props to them for that, really.

813
01:01:39,954 --> 01:01:40,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do that.

814
01:01:40,694 --> 01:01:41,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I have an iPhone.

815
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:43,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Touche.

816
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:53,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this has just been exactly like you said, a music-loaded, you know... It really has.

817
01:01:53,400 --> 01:02:00,022
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a music-filled show tonight, and it's not just because we love music games based on our history, but it really has been dominating the news this week.

818
01:02:00,323 --> 01:02:04,664
[SPEAKER_03]: But consider how much music games are selling these days between Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and all that.

819
01:02:04,944 --> 01:02:05,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big business now.

820
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,571
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

821
01:02:24,611 --> 01:02:35,078
[SPEAKER_09]: There are over 2.2 million SingStar songs were downloaded from the Sing Store that launched about a year ago.

822
01:02:36,259 --> 01:02:42,763
[SPEAKER_09]: So now there's actually new plans for a Disney version for PS2 that's all Disney songs.

823
01:02:44,807 --> 01:02:49,512
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a rumor about this a while back and I called bullshit on it because I thought Disney would do it themselves.

824
01:02:49,713 --> 01:02:51,595
[SPEAKER_03]: They are doing it themselves.

825
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:53,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's more.

826
01:02:53,497 --> 01:02:53,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, go ahead.

827
01:02:53,997 --> 01:02:54,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

828
01:02:54,898 --> 01:02:58,142
[SPEAKER_09]: It's exclusively for PAL territories.

829
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:05,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, because in the North American territories, and possibly Japan, I don't know.

830
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:16,407
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's compatible with the SingStar PS3, and of course if you have an HD TV, it won't matter if it's PAL or not.

831
01:03:16,768 --> 01:03:19,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, it's not just because SingStar performs better in Europe?

832
01:03:19,611 --> 01:03:19,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

833
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,263
[SPEAKER_02]: It does perform better in Europe, but in the U.S.

834
01:03:24,203 --> 01:03:36,874
[SPEAKER_02]: or North America, I should say, they are releasing Disney Sing It, which is basically like SingStar, but it's all the Disney songs and their kind of version of a karaoke game.

835
01:03:37,432 --> 01:03:39,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually like SingStar better than Karaoke Revolution.

836
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:53,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I have really high hopes for Lips.

837
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:55,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to take what's great from both games.

838
01:04:08,408 --> 01:04:08,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly.

839
01:04:08,908 --> 01:04:23,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's kind of cool also, I was going to say, there's another announcement that they're going to do a patch for SingStar PS3 where you can use your PlayStation 2 discs to import songs from that as well, like you can with the PlayStation 2 version.

840
01:04:24,055 --> 01:04:24,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

841
01:04:24,515 --> 01:04:25,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great idea.

842
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:26,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for them.

843
01:04:29,656 --> 01:04:39,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else that's kind of neat, and I was reading in the chatroom, well actually that was for Africa, but no more games are going to get added onto the bet.

844
01:04:40,124 --> 01:04:41,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can forget about it.

845
01:04:42,025 --> 01:04:46,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is another game that will not be added onto the bet, but it also uses the PlayStation Eye.

846
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:48,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Eye Pet.

847
01:04:49,091 --> 01:04:54,075
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a game where you prod what looks to be a little monkey creature.

848
01:04:55,439 --> 01:04:57,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, it is very cute looking.

849
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:07,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I didn't have a TV that was, you know, kind of a, with a plastic screen, you know, an LCD TV, I would let my cat play with this.

850
01:05:09,344 --> 01:05:12,245
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, so it's a virtual pet.

851
01:05:13,446 --> 01:05:14,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to poke it.

852
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:15,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's coming out in 2009.

853
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:20,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh goody, just what the world needs.

854
01:05:20,906 --> 01:05:21,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll probably have pets.

855
01:05:22,106 --> 01:05:29,690
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll probably have, well this is kind of cool because you can pick it up and stuff or pretend to pick it up and throw it around.

856
01:05:31,351 --> 01:05:35,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the end of Part A in the Classic Game of the Week.

857
01:05:36,535 --> 01:05:38,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's more music games.

858
01:05:38,296 --> 01:05:39,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we just had a lot to talk about tonight.

859
01:05:39,877 --> 01:05:42,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question is, what's Harmonix gonna do next?

860
01:05:42,499 --> 01:05:45,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, they've obviously had mega success with Rock Band.

861
01:05:46,461 --> 01:05:54,147
[SPEAKER_03]: The rumor is that apparently Harmonix is dealing in the new game that has to do with music creation.

862
01:05:54,587 --> 01:05:59,850
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that their PR rep John Drake said talking to MTV's multiplayer blog.

863
01:06:00,851 --> 01:06:02,712
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done the whole MIDI creation thing.

864
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:09,094
[SPEAKER_03]: We think we can do something really ambitious and really great that's going to speak across all the users of the game, not just hardcore users.

865
01:06:09,374 --> 01:06:12,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will result in some awesome stuff and not just Final Fantasy covers.

866
01:06:13,255 --> 01:06:18,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So interesting that Harmonix might get into a little more of the creation.

867
01:06:18,576 --> 01:06:20,837
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Harmonix has put out a lot of solid products.

868
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:23,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I assume if they're going to go this way, it's going to be some pretty good stuff.

869
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:29,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to the next project and I hope it's just not, you know, Rock Band 3, Rock Band 4, Rock Band 5.

870
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

871
01:06:30,942 --> 01:06:34,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to new original things they come out with.

872
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:35,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't you agree?

873
01:06:36,206 --> 01:06:37,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

874
01:06:37,647 --> 01:06:38,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I had mine.

875
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:39,669
[SPEAKER_02]: What, Loki?

876
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, kind of going back to the last story we had.

877
01:06:44,028 --> 01:06:46,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I was checking out the trailer for that iPad.

878
01:06:46,189 --> 01:06:48,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually looks really cute, actually.

879
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:50,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by it.

880
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:53,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised to hearing you describing a game as cute.

881
01:06:53,612 --> 01:06:54,572
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes it so cute?

882
01:06:55,073 --> 01:06:57,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the creature is incredibly fuzzy and cute.

883
01:06:58,274 --> 01:07:00,495
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of looks like a little miniature monkey Simba.

884
01:07:01,095 --> 01:07:06,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, what's kind of neat, though, is some of the technology that they're using with it.

885
01:07:06,157 --> 01:07:07,318
[SPEAKER_02]: You can draw your pet.

886
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:08,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Toys.

887
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:12,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you draw a little car and it becomes a car.

888
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:16,868
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like some of those tech demos they were showing off using the PlayStation Eye.

889
01:07:17,608 --> 01:07:19,410
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of thing with the PlayStation Eye.

890
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:25,355
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually doing some really cool things with it unlike the Eye toy which is just a lot of crap.

891
01:07:25,976 --> 01:07:29,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of excited to see what they're going to do with this.

892
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:34,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And I may actually have to pick up this game just because my cat would love playing with this thing.

893
01:07:36,581 --> 01:07:40,363
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

894
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:08,801
[SPEAKER_03]: What should the kids be playing this week?

895
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:16,563
[SPEAKER_09]: The game of the week is Jet Set Radio, which is one of my all-time favorite games.

896
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have some music, shall we, Rob?

897
01:08:19,684 --> 01:08:20,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Working on it.

898
01:08:20,444 --> 01:08:20,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

899
01:08:21,545 --> 01:08:34,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at any rate, Jet Set Radio is a game where you start off as this guy named Beat, who is a runaway who got shoved from gang to gang until he decided to make one of his own, and they basically just go around tagging shit.

900
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:39,513
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really the purpose of the game, is to tag stuff and wipe out your opposition.

901
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:41,915
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's got some good music in it.

902
01:08:43,476 --> 01:08:46,519
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got some Guitar Vader, which I like Guitar Vader.

903
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:57,369
[SPEAKER_09]: In the US version, there was a track by Mix Master Mike, and by, actually Dragula was in it, Rob Zombie.

904
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:09,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And there were a few that were only in the PAL release, too, such as, let's see, some of the groups was Semi-Detached and Jurassic 5.

905
01:09:09,123 --> 01:09:15,170
[SPEAKER_09]: The Japanese version, there was one by David Soule.

906
01:09:15,511 --> 01:09:17,573
[SPEAKER_09]: So each release had its own stuff.

907
01:09:17,593 --> 01:09:18,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's play some music.

908
01:09:20,692 --> 01:09:28,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set a bomb in the city, get close to it and it'll go beep, and then boom!

909
01:09:31,994 --> 01:09:33,876
[SPEAKER_03]: This game really was a lot of fun.

910
01:09:34,016 --> 01:09:35,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed this game on the Dreamcast.

911
01:09:36,318 --> 01:09:47,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at any rate, the way that you go through the game is that you've got basically rollerblades, and you pick up different people in the game to bring them into your own little gang of Rudies, they're called.

912
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:54,295
[SPEAKER_09]: The main guy, Beat, is very all-around even.

913
01:09:54,495 --> 01:09:55,476
[SPEAKER_09]: He's very balanced.

914
01:09:55,936 --> 01:09:57,077
[SPEAKER_09]: But you get another guy later.

915
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember his name.

916
01:09:58,177 --> 01:10:00,559
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the guy who had the big boombox.

917
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:03,280
[SPEAKER_09]: He was really slow and really tough.

918
01:10:04,021 --> 01:10:06,502
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could use him for like endurance.

919
01:10:07,242 --> 01:10:11,205
[SPEAKER_09]: But as the game goes through, you know, the police come after you and you have to knock them over.

920
01:10:12,405 --> 01:10:30,197
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can actually tag the head detective who comes after you um but in later stages like they send out helicopters to shoot you down and all kinds of stuff it's crazy and then the last level is you're fighting this guy on top of a giant record album who's trying to use the album to summon a demon but and I won't ruin that for anybody

921
01:10:31,434 --> 01:10:35,017
[SPEAKER_09]: But there were other releases after this first one came out.

922
01:10:36,678 --> 01:10:46,626
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, the Jet Set Radio thing is actually this Professor K is a DJ in a pirate radio station in the city of Tokyo-cho.

923
01:10:47,547 --> 01:11:00,457
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also different areas in the game that represent a different time of day, like Shibuya-cho is daytime, Benten-cho is nighttime, and Kogane-cho is like a residential area at sunset.

924
01:11:00,737 --> 01:11:02,058
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

925
01:11:03,758 --> 01:11:05,439
[SPEAKER_09]: But you've also got your rival gangs in there.

926
01:11:05,539 --> 01:11:11,782
[SPEAKER_09]: There is the Poison Jam that wear fish costumes.

927
01:11:11,802 --> 01:11:12,682
[SPEAKER_09]: They're kind of stupid.

928
01:11:12,722 --> 01:11:14,963
[SPEAKER_09]: The Noise Tanks are cyborg types.

929
01:11:15,503 --> 01:11:22,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And Love Shockers are a girl game that look like the emo rangers, which I thought was funny.

930
01:11:22,106 --> 01:11:23,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have to fight the golden rhinos later.

931
01:11:24,888 --> 01:11:36,537
[SPEAKER_09]: The other versions that I was talking about is there was Adjusted Radio Future that came out on Xbox and we got it in America as JSRF, Adjusted Radio Future.

932
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:38,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out in Europe too.

933
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically it was...

934
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:44,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a bit more touched up, you know, had different music.

935
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:51,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Just That Radio came out on Game Boy Advance that was from an isometric perspective.

936
01:11:51,914 --> 01:11:54,678
[SPEAKER_09]: It was alright, you know, it was cute.

937
01:11:54,758 --> 01:11:55,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there was actually...

938
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:10,269
[SPEAKER_09]: One that was actually released called De La Jet Set Radio, which was the deluxe version that was only in Japan via Dreamcast Direct.

939
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:12,050
[SPEAKER_09]: It later came out as Sega Direct.

940
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:17,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really hard to get a hold of, but you actually...

941
01:12:18,914 --> 01:12:19,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

942
01:12:42,384 --> 01:12:43,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards!

943
01:12:43,705 --> 01:12:44,865
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be so great!

944
01:12:45,226 --> 01:12:51,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Or especially with all the Dreamcast love we've seen on Xbox Live Arcade lately, what with Soul Calibur and some of these games.

945
01:12:51,769 --> 01:12:57,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see Jet Set Radio kind of take a new form on Xbox Live Arcade or something, you know what I mean?

946
01:12:57,752 --> 01:12:59,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let this franchise rot away.

947
01:13:01,098 --> 01:13:09,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the other thing that I also didn't mention is that, as much as I hate the name, we did get our first release in America as Jet Grind Radio.

948
01:13:09,821 --> 01:13:11,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know why.

949
01:13:11,322 --> 01:13:14,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I think maybe someone else had licensed Jet Set Radio or something.

950
01:13:15,363 --> 01:13:18,524
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's stupid, so now they fixed it for later versions.

951
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:19,905
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

952
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:25,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well there you have it, your classic game of the week.

953
01:13:26,086 --> 01:13:29,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet Set Radio, or Jet Grind Radio, whatever you prefer.

954
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:32,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go do some graffiti, but not in real life.

955
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:33,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Strictly for the games.

956
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the other thing about that, you actually had a graffiti editor.

957
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,092
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, I remember that.

958
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:38,733
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

959
01:13:40,705 --> 01:13:42,167
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's why they need that.

960
01:13:42,187 --> 01:13:47,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine, with download content and everything, we could have OLR gang signs that you could use as graffiti.

961
01:13:47,694 --> 01:13:48,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there you have it.

962
01:13:48,556 --> 01:13:51,519
[SPEAKER_03]: A very excellent classic game of the week.

963
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,961
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true classic there.

964
01:13:53,422 --> 01:13:55,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we are going to take a break, but...

965
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:56,365
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time.

966
01:14:17,234 --> 01:14:20,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick couple of songs and then some free break.

967
01:14:20,477 --> 01:14:24,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio Part B. Lots of stuff to come.

968
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:28,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumors abound about the 360 and this apparent price drop that's coming.

969
01:14:28,644 --> 01:14:33,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And if Microsoft's going to be taking some cues from Nintendo and what have you.

970
01:14:33,788 --> 01:14:36,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, by the way, something a lot of our listeners call in to talk about.

971
01:14:37,551 --> 01:14:38,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Canned.

972
01:14:38,612 --> 01:14:39,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Not happening this year.

973
01:14:39,653 --> 01:14:44,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about all that in Part B when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

974
01:14:50,839 --> 01:14:57,806
[SPEAKER_14]: So you've got a bunch of websites and podcasts about anime, manga, or video games, but you just don't have the time to read and listen to them all.

975
01:14:58,347 --> 01:15:01,711
[SPEAKER_14]: When are you actually going to find the time to play games or watch anime?

976
01:15:04,654 --> 01:15:06,015
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why there's Anigamers.

977
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:12,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only are we a comprehensive anime, manga, and video game blog with news and reviews, but we've also got a podcast.

978
01:15:12,867 --> 01:15:16,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Tune in to hear our insightful conversation about your favorite geeky topics.

979
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:22,034
[SPEAKER_00]: We do news, reviews, con reports, debates, and even recorded convention panels.

980
01:15:22,294 --> 01:15:26,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, you can expect something different from the Anti-Gamers Podcast every time.

981
01:15:26,978 --> 01:15:32,703
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because we always bring in new co-hosts, including our own staff, other podcasters, and industry insiders.

983
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,711
[SPEAKER_16]: The Annie Gamers Podcast.

984
01:15:42,731 --> 01:15:45,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we all need another anime and gaming podcast.

985
01:15:46,795 --> 01:15:46,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Right?

986
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:53,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts from OLR here.

987
01:15:54,094 --> 01:15:57,936
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I hate it when people come up to me and tell me I just lost the game.

988
01:15:58,557 --> 01:16:00,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help but think to myself, what game?

989
01:16:01,178 --> 01:16:06,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not playing any video games right this second, or I don't remember signing up to play Monopoly.

990
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:10,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it's some stupid internet joke where if I think about the game, I lose the game.

991
01:16:11,584 --> 01:16:16,708
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, next time some kid tells me I just lost the game, I'm gonna tell them that they just lost their balance.

992
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:19,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when they look at me like a puppy dog and say, what?

993
01:16:19,571 --> 01:16:20,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll kick them in the shin.

994
01:16:21,012 --> 01:16:22,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll point and laugh.

995
01:16:22,413 --> 01:16:24,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm not playing your fucking stupid game.

996
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:35,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't make it to this year's Penny Arcade Expo?

997
01:16:35,384 --> 01:16:36,986
[SPEAKER_04]: All Games Radio has you covered.

998
01:16:37,765 --> 01:16:38,586
[SPEAKER_11]: We're totally excited.

999
01:16:38,646 --> 01:16:43,131
[SPEAKER_11]: I was at PAX last year when we announced that we were doing the game, and this is like twice as big.

1000
01:16:43,172 --> 01:16:44,493
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just unbelievably amazing.

1001
01:16:44,753 --> 01:16:51,762
[SPEAKER_04]: For three days, All Games Radio will bring you a total of eight hours of live coverage from the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle.

1002
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear ninjas take away five durability points.

1003
01:16:54,700 --> 01:17:00,766
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I haven't run into a ninja in the Burning Sea, but if they mythically did exist, I suspect they would take away five durability.

1004
01:17:00,846 --> 01:17:01,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they do exist.

1005
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:02,367
[SPEAKER_05]: They're coming for you.

1006
01:17:02,588 --> 01:17:09,814

[SPEAKER_04]: It could be the best trip of all time or it has.

1010
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:35,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite a few opportunities to go wrong on a lot of different levels.

1011
01:17:35,446 --> 01:17:40,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Coverage begins at 7pm Eastern, 4pm Pacific on August 29th, 30th, and 31st.

[SPEAKER_04]: This is our people.

1018
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:58,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

1019
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:07,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1020
01:18:07,647 --> 01:18:08,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1021
01:18:08,428 --> 01:18:11,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1022
01:18:28,666 --> 01:18:30,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so freaking excited about PAX.

1023
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:31,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't get here any sooner.

1024
01:18:32,802 --> 01:18:34,162
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1025
01:18:59,387 --> 01:19:26,738
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as participating in the Penny Arcade coverage that you heard there during the free break on allgames.com and that's available if you want more information on that pax.allgames.com has all the information you need to know about that and by the way I love that ad I love the fact that they have a guy in a radio voice going and joining them is Super Happy Funtime Show some of those other awesomely named podcasts that we're going to be attending with alright

1026
01:19:27,578 --> 01:19:28,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back into some gaming news.

1027
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's this about the price drop?

1028
01:19:32,363 --> 01:19:32,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it happening?

1029
01:19:34,004 --> 01:19:34,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1030
01:19:35,085 --> 01:19:40,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Where there's smoke, there's fire, and there's Xbox 360 price drops.

1031
01:19:41,251 --> 01:19:52,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you remember back a few weeks ago that there was a rumor that the Xbox 360 would be dropping in price on all three SKUs, including the recently introduced 60GB Pro system.

1032
01:19:53,902 --> 01:19:59,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if the rumor is true, then on September 7th, the arcade will be dropping to $199.

1033
01:20:00,406 --> 01:20:06,630
[SPEAKER_02]: The pro system, the 60 gig, will be dropping to $299 and the elite to $399.

1034
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:11,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a little bit more proof that it will probably happen because guess what?

1035
01:20:11,132 --> 01:20:17,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like all those other price drops that have ever happened, there have been some ads leaked.

1036
01:20:18,116 --> 01:20:20,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And wouldn't you know it, Radio Shack is listing...

1037
01:20:21,607 --> 01:20:30,171
[SPEAKER_02]: The Elite for $3.99, and the Arcade for $1.99, and the ad says it's good starting September 7th.

1038
01:20:30,471 --> 01:20:33,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you, Radio Shack, for ruining it all.

1039
01:20:33,592 --> 01:20:40,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, sure we could go and say that this is all rumor and stuff, but come on.

1040
01:20:41,115 --> 01:20:43,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not going to insult your intelligence.

1041
01:20:43,196 --> 01:20:45,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course there's going to be a fucking price drop happening.

1042
01:20:46,297 --> 01:20:47,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1043
01:21:00,677 --> 01:21:06,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think maybe next time they should take a different approach and not tell retailers until the day they're ready to do it?

1044
01:21:06,342 --> 01:21:06,862
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't.

1045
01:21:07,022 --> 01:21:10,565
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't because they have to set up their advertising that way and co-op and stuff.

1046
01:21:10,946 --> 01:21:16,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's really no way to do it other than punish the people leaking the stuff out.

1047
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:18,952
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too hard though.

1048
01:21:18,972 --> 01:21:19,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be anybody.

1049
01:21:20,734 --> 01:21:24,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a small list of people, but I don't know.

1050
01:21:25,777 --> 01:21:29,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what's interesting though is you've got a few things happening.

1051
01:21:44,225 --> 01:21:52,610
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's priced the same as the soon-to-be-introduced 80GB core system from Sony's PS3 line there.

1052
01:21:53,430 --> 01:22:03,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the arcade system, which there's some info on that too coming later, priced lower than the Wii.

1053
01:22:04,676 --> 01:22:06,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's kind of interesting right there.

1054
01:22:06,437 --> 01:22:07,518
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very interesting.

1055
01:22:07,538 --> 01:22:11,020
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are Wii shortages during the holiday, people might go, hey,

1056
01:22:12,131 --> 01:22:12,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy a 360.

1057
01:22:12,692 --> 01:22:13,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheaper.

1058
01:22:14,114 --> 01:22:15,696
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably exactly what they want people to do.

1059
01:22:15,716 --> 01:22:16,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheaper and easier to find.

1060
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:17,579
[SPEAKER_02]: More games out there.

1061
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:20,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they've got family-friendly titles.

1062
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:27,694
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really pulling out some good game plan.

1063
01:22:27,714 --> 01:22:28,495
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I've got to say.

1064
01:22:29,301 --> 01:22:31,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, I'm looking at comments in chat here.

1065
01:22:32,263 --> 01:22:35,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Joshi16 says, I may buy an arcade just so I can put an Xbox in another room.

1066
01:22:37,425 --> 01:22:40,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Ranma says, hey Sony, 360 is getting a price drop.

1067
01:22:40,827 --> 01:22:42,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the same for PS3, you fuckers.

1068
01:22:44,589 --> 01:22:47,671
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTesturious says, my brother keeps bugging me about when's the PS3 coming down.

1069
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:53,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And IkumaJP, our good friend from Japan, agrees with Loki.

1070
01:22:53,174 --> 01:22:55,195
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they can't advertise this stuff in advance.

1071
01:22:55,895 --> 01:22:58,457
[SPEAKER_03]: But he does say, every time a leak happens, kittens get killed.

1072
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:01,008
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the old saying.

1073
01:23:01,448 --> 01:23:06,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, you know, Loki mentioned where there's smoke, there's fire, but could there be a freaking nuclear bomb?

1074
01:23:08,354 --> 01:23:14,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about this one, but apparently, you know, the arcade skew, you know, coming down to $199 based on what Loki said, here it comes again.

1075
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:21,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumors that there is a motion controller coming with that Xbox 360 arcade this holiday.

1076
01:23:21,626 --> 01:23:26,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently this new arcade system, now this, again, this may not necessarily be the one that comes on September 7th,

1077
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:33,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think if it is, we would have heard about it a long time ago, but possibly one that's coming later on by the holidays.

1078
01:23:33,813 --> 01:23:42,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It says that it's going to come with a 512MB memory card, and the new Xbox experience is already there on the system, so you don't even have to get online to get it.

1079
01:23:42,878 --> 01:23:49,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And a motion controller is supposed to be coming with it, along with some compatible minigames that have been developed by Rare.

1080
01:23:50,601 --> 01:23:51,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here's where it gets weird.

1081
01:23:52,042 --> 01:23:57,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, this controller is also supposed to be sold separately with even more minigames by Rare.

1082
01:23:58,666 --> 01:23:59,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

1083
01:23:59,787 --> 01:24:04,409
[SPEAKER_03]: The controller, though, is supposedly going to work with any Xbox 360 that's already out there.

1084
01:24:04,449 --> 01:24:07,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's not like you have to get a new Xbox just to have this motion controller.

1085
01:24:08,632 --> 01:24:09,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1086
01:24:09,593 --> 01:24:10,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Fact or crap?

1087
01:24:10,873 --> 01:24:11,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I say it's crap.

1088
01:24:12,895 --> 01:24:14,756
[SPEAKER_02]: This time.

1089
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:18,218
[SPEAKER_02]: If it actually does happen, it will have to happen by...

1090
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:20,170
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1091
01:24:44,862 --> 01:24:55,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so because if they were going to release, if they were going to try to clear off the shelves of arcade units they would have dropped it down to $199 and this would come out at $239 or whatever.

1092
01:24:56,491 --> 01:25:05,678
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen though is it does have to come out by the end of October because the end of October is when the new Scenic game comes out and it has Avatar support already built in.

1093
01:25:06,039 --> 01:25:08,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So the new firmware update is coming out before that.

1094
01:25:09,261 --> 01:25:14,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this firmware update is being included on the actual console, it has to come out before the end of October.

1095
01:25:14,766 --> 01:25:20,111
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, Loki, they're not going to do two SKU things back-to-back like that.

1096
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:30,141
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to do this because including the 512MB memory unit makes it on par with Nintendo's system, and it's cheaper, and it has motion-controlled stuff.

1097
01:25:31,394 --> 01:25:33,295
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, any interest in motion control on 360 at all?

1098
01:25:33,315 --> 01:25:33,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

1099
01:25:33,655 --> 01:25:34,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated it on PS3.

1100
01:26:00,566 --> 01:26:03,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, with the whole six axis, oh true, we always forget about that.

1101
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:15,206
[SPEAKER_09]: And honestly, I don't really play that many Wii games, you know, I don't really enjoy them as much using the controller that way, so I'm not excited.

1102
01:26:15,697 --> 01:26:17,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we'll see what happens.

1103
01:26:17,878 --> 01:26:21,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft in chat says, If Microsoft's smart, they will make the arcade have the 20 gigabyte drive.

1104
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:23,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1105
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,001
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as they can keep selling that separately, why not?

1106
01:26:25,521 --> 01:26:28,842
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, it makes a lot of sense because Microsoft's trying to do a lot more digital distribution.

1107
01:26:29,222 --> 01:26:29,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1108
01:26:29,803 --> 01:26:30,063
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1109
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:46,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking of other Microsoft stuff, there was, at the Leipzig convention, a controller that was almost identical except for being kind of a pukey green color that had a corrected D-pad.

1110
01:26:46,068 --> 01:26:58,056
[SPEAKER_09]: It was supposed to be a lot more easy to use, better control on it, and it was supposed to be coming out along with Pro Evolution Soccer 2009.

1111
01:27:01,538 --> 01:27:18,870
[SPEAKER_09]: people were pretty excited about it except that it was stated to be a limited edition promotional item that is going to be out on October 24th however it's as long as supplies last and only available in Europe, Asia, and Latin America

1112
01:27:19,395 --> 01:27:20,436
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1113
01:27:34,574 --> 01:27:35,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Fix it across the board!

1114
01:28:02,409 --> 01:28:17,441
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they'll probably just tweak the whole controller because there's no reason to make an entirely different mold and you know circuit board setup or whatever they have to do for you know the Xbox 360 controller fix the problem and just say okay we're done no more fixing you know

1115
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:19,534
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just gonna fix it.

1116
01:28:20,014 --> 01:28:20,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

1117
01:28:20,555 --> 01:28:21,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're right.

1118
01:28:21,216 --> 01:28:31,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love... You know, although I kind of resent the fact I'm gonna have to buy a whole new Xbox 360 controller to fix what was essentially their crappy D-pad, but I'll do it because, I mean, I don't know how you guys feel.

1119
01:28:31,766 --> 01:28:33,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that D-pad on the Xbox.

1120
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:35,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it really does take away from some of those games.

1121
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:38,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you guys feel, but I hate it.

1122
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use that control pad a lot, DarkSakura?

1123
01:28:42,061 --> 01:28:42,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really hate it.

1124
01:28:43,601 --> 01:28:44,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stand it.

1125
01:28:44,762 --> 01:28:47,623
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not feel nearly as slick as Sony's pad.

1126
01:28:47,843 --> 01:28:51,124
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's true, but I never had a problem with it, really.

1127
01:28:51,385 --> 01:28:52,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that much of a problem.

1128
01:28:52,585 --> 01:28:52,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1129
01:28:53,525 --> 01:28:53,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1130
01:28:54,486 --> 01:28:55,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you have it.

1131
01:28:56,086 --> 01:28:59,848
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be like the Wii D-pad.

1132
01:29:00,228 --> 01:29:01,048
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome.

1133
01:29:01,929 --> 01:29:02,149
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

1134
01:29:02,802 --> 01:29:03,703
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1135
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,653
[SPEAKER_02]: and eat it for free.

1136
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:31,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty awesome.

1137
01:29:31,734 --> 01:29:33,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And Banjo-Kazooie, of course, coming out for $40.

1138
01:29:34,015 --> 01:29:39,577
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly, mid-November.

1139
01:29:40,157 --> 01:29:43,819
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be like the 17th or 16th?

1140
01:29:44,299 --> 01:29:44,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

1141
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1142
01:29:47,781 --> 01:29:48,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat.

1143
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:49,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Not my game.

1144
01:29:51,242 --> 01:29:51,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my thing.

1145
01:29:52,523 --> 01:29:53,023
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously.

1146
01:29:53,203 --> 01:29:55,964
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tons of Banjo-Kazooie fans out there, though, that I'm sure are very excited.

1147
01:29:55,984 --> 01:29:57,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not... I don't know.

1148
01:30:02,511 --> 01:30:03,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I should.

1149
01:30:04,113 --> 01:30:04,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1150
01:30:05,534 --> 01:30:07,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to get the achievement points.

1151
01:30:07,596 --> 01:30:08,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Admit it, Loki.

1152
01:30:08,117 --> 01:30:08,697
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you want to do.

1153
01:30:08,717 --> 01:30:10,439
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to go back and get the achievement points.

1154
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:16,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do, but also I want to just play through the game because it's supposed to be pretty cool.

1155
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:23,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out to Xbox Live Arcade someday is a Lode Runner remake.

1156
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:34,470
[SPEAKER_03]: They had it on Apple IIe.

1157
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:36,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I had this game on Commodore 64.

1158
01:30:36,752 --> 01:30:38,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically it was a very simple game.

1159
01:30:38,213 --> 01:30:40,474
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like a puzzle slash action game.

1160
01:30:40,774 --> 01:30:45,678
[SPEAKER_03]: You played this little stick man who ran around and there were ladders and monkey bars that you could kind of crawl across.

1161
01:30:46,218 --> 01:30:51,882
[SPEAKER_03]: What you would know this game best for was how you could dig a hole in the bricks and fall through them in a certain strategy.

1162
01:30:52,082 --> 01:30:52,842
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1163
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:16,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming.

1164
01:31:17,355 --> 01:31:18,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhat soon.

1165
01:31:18,816 --> 01:31:20,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe before the holidays, I don't know.

1166
01:31:21,477 --> 01:31:24,638
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a lot of good releases coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

1167
01:31:24,798 --> 01:31:25,539
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know though.

1168
01:31:25,559 --> 01:31:35,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to admit, Lode Runner is kind of one of those 80s early games that was a lot of fun back in the day, but I think if you played it now, I think the nostalgia would be gone soon, unless they've made a lot of updates and changes to it.

1169
01:31:36,663 --> 01:31:39,064
[SPEAKER_03]: This game has gone through a lot of different stages.

1170
01:31:39,084 --> 01:31:43,086
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a version put out in the early 90s, I want to say by Sierra, on Windows 9.

1171
01:31:43,726 --> 01:31:44,568
[SPEAKER_03]: either Windows 95 or 3.1.

1172
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:45,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1173
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:49,019
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a kind of version with souped up graphics that added some stuff to it.

1174
01:31:50,848 --> 01:31:52,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1175
01:31:52,368 --> 01:31:55,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Queltipo in chat says, Lode Runner was the game of choice in my school library.

1176
01:31:56,089 --> 01:31:59,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Ours was Montzuma Revenge in the early, early days.

1177
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I got into junior high school, Scorched Earth.

1178
01:32:03,331 --> 01:32:04,171
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about Scorched Earth.

1179
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:05,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Scorched Earth.

1180
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:05,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Kicks.

1181
01:32:06,012 --> 01:32:08,912
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw that they're making a Scorched... Sorry, Kicks was what I was playing in school.

1182
01:32:09,212 --> 01:32:11,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you had to issue Classic Game of the Week a few weeks ago for a reason.

1183
01:32:11,973 --> 01:32:16,354
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw that they're making a Scorched Earth type game that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1184
01:32:17,154 --> 01:32:18,254
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1185
01:32:18,635 --> 01:32:19,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it has... You know, like...

1186
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:23,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Worms is kind of like Scorched Earth, though.

1187
01:32:23,816 --> 01:32:27,776
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want something that's really kind of scaled.

1188
01:32:28,156 --> 01:32:32,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's actually scaled back a bit in terms of, you know, you are a tank.

1189
01:32:32,457 --> 01:32:33,237
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not move.

1190
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:36,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the craziness of Scorched Earth.

1191
01:32:36,578 --> 01:32:39,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember how you could get those nuclear bombs that would blow up past the screen?

1192
01:32:40,279 --> 01:32:41,639
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what I was talking about.

1193
01:32:42,419 --> 01:32:44,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Just port Scorched Earth to Xbox Live Arcade.

1194
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,800
[SPEAKER_03]: There'd be a heck of people that would play it.

1195
01:32:46,735 --> 01:32:47,895
[SPEAKER_03]: VGA Tank Anger Management Issues

1196
01:33:08,183 --> 01:33:10,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, need anger management training.

1197
01:33:11,425 --> 01:33:17,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really so much as just need to not take out their frustrations on the inanimate object.

1198
01:33:18,568 --> 01:33:29,174
[SPEAKER_09]: However, there was a man who had warned his three sons about how they were misbehaving while playing their Xbox.

1199
01:33:29,194 --> 01:33:32,656
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is an old, monstrosity, humongous Xbox.

1200
01:33:33,756 --> 01:33:38,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, he took their Xbox and nailed it to a tree.

1201
01:33:41,339 --> 01:33:44,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Ripped out the circuit board, everything, and nailed it to a tree.

1202
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:45,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Jesus.

1203
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:47,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

1204
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:48,921
[SPEAKER_03]: That must have been a big nail.

1205
01:33:51,858 --> 01:33:55,299
[SPEAKER_09]: and their mother is saying the problem was addressed properly.

1206
01:33:55,759 --> 01:33:57,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was addressed very poorly.

1207
01:33:58,019 --> 01:34:02,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if they feel like wasting however much it cost at the time, feel free.

1208
01:34:02,721 --> 01:34:03,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Waste the money all you want to.

1209
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:13,223
[SPEAKER_09]: However, they are putting the Nailed to a Tree Xbox... Well, I should say the...

1210
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:20,392
[SPEAKER_09]: or maybe as Loki was saying, the Jesus Edition Xbox on eBay.

1211
01:34:21,633 --> 01:34:22,914
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on an auction right now.

1212
01:34:23,054 --> 01:34:26,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, because people are retarded and will pay lots of money for that crap.

1213
01:34:26,337 --> 01:34:26,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that one?

1214
01:34:27,298 --> 01:34:29,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, there was more to that.

1215
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:29,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1216
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:30,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1217
01:34:31,621 --> 01:34:38,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Half of the proceeds are going to be going to their local schools and the other half will be going to the Children's College Fund.

1218
01:34:38,507 --> 01:34:39,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1219
01:34:50,572 --> 01:34:52,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Over a thousand dollars for it.

1220
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:52,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Preposterous.

1221
01:34:53,113 --> 01:34:54,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just retarded.

1222
01:34:54,234 --> 01:34:56,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people do not buy this thing.

1223
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:59,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a broken Xbox, and you're really going to pay good money for it?

1224
01:34:59,457 --> 01:35:02,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope someone buys it, because then I can laugh at them for being a big fucking idiot.

1225
01:35:04,099 --> 01:35:12,624
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the most important question that rises from this, as Joystick asks, will it blend?

1226
01:35:14,685 --> 01:35:14,905
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1227
01:35:15,365 --> 01:35:15,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet it will.

1228
01:35:16,346 --> 01:35:18,027
[SPEAKER_03]: This type of idiocy will not blend.

1229
01:35:18,871 --> 01:35:26,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at any rate, I definitely... I want to find out who wins the auction just so that I can publicly ridicule them.

1230
01:35:27,386 --> 01:35:28,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I need good laughing fodder.

1231
01:35:28,748 --> 01:35:29,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people disagree.

1232
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:31,393
[SPEAKER_03]: ShowerAnne in chat says, This dad kicks ass.

1233
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:36,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it interesting that it's funding the kids' college fund, though.

1234
01:35:36,542 --> 01:35:38,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of an interesting little side effect to it.

1235
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:43,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to back up and go to the last story, but damn, I was curious.

1236
01:35:43,187 --> 01:35:46,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby Blackwell filled me in as well on some stuff going on.

1237
01:35:46,409 --> 01:35:50,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there is a Java version of Scorched Earth that you can play online.

1238
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:51,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And he actually gave me the address here.

1239
01:35:51,773 --> 01:35:54,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Scorch2000.com You can actually still play Scorched Earth.

1240
01:35:55,236 --> 01:35:56,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was looking at Wikipedia, though.

1241
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:57,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's an official port.

1242
01:35:57,797 --> 01:36:01,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some type of clone game.

1243
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:11,042
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently, according to Wikipedia, back in 2005, the original developer said that more information on the official version might surface soon.

1244
01:36:11,343 --> 01:36:12,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It was reiterated in 2006.

1245
01:36:13,503 --> 01:36:17,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, there's some type of Scorched Earth project that's been going on since March of 2006.

1246
01:36:19,345 --> 01:36:24,126
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a CD called Totally Scorched through the official website of Scorched Earth for $20.

1247
01:36:26,121 --> 01:36:27,043
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1248
01:36:34,181 --> 01:36:34,421
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1249
01:36:35,302 --> 01:36:37,743
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I do not want Xbox Tree Dad on our show.

1250
01:36:37,823 --> 01:36:40,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would just not be able to control it because it's a little silly.

1251
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:41,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to make fun of him, too.

1252
01:36:41,686 --> 01:36:42,166
[SPEAKER_03]: A little silly.

1253
01:36:42,226 --> 01:36:42,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1254
01:36:43,067 --> 01:36:43,447
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

1255
01:36:43,507 --> 01:36:46,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more the person who buys this than him.

1256
01:36:46,809 --> 01:36:49,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, however you want to parent your kids is your business.

1257
01:36:49,811 --> 01:36:56,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that he was right to punish the children, but, you know, why not just put the functional Xbox on eBay?

1258
01:36:57,196 --> 01:36:59,177
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that way you're, you know...

1259
01:37:00,458 --> 01:37:02,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting money for selling a functional product?

1260
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to just taking the cord?

1261
01:37:06,082 --> 01:37:06,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1262
01:37:07,063 --> 01:37:10,125
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that never worked with me because I would always find it.

1263
01:37:11,667 --> 01:37:12,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It never worked with me either.

1264
01:37:12,587 --> 01:37:13,908
[SPEAKER_09]: My mother took my TV away.

1265
01:37:13,928 --> 01:37:15,189
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how much of a brat I was.

1266
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:22,015
[SPEAKER_09]: My mother took my TV away and I went and took it back and hooked everything back up and told her she couldn't do that because it was theft because she never bought it for me.

1267
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:26,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Better yet, and I know we're kind of contributing to this, why is this news?

1268
01:37:27,589 --> 01:37:28,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

1269
01:37:28,829 --> 01:37:36,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, it's like, kid gets punished in some creative way, and I mean, who reported on this first?

1270
01:37:36,793 --> 01:37:41,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously we reported on a story that someone else reported on, but did this, like, make the paper?

1271
01:37:41,855 --> 01:37:44,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is this like in Iowa or something, you know?

1272
01:37:45,856 --> 01:38:00,319
[SPEAKER_09]: The person who needs to actually make themselves a username instead of being OLR me recruit whatever just linked the article up via eBay auction I should say.

1273
01:38:01,879 --> 01:38:02,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now $8.50.

1274
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:03,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.

1275
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,020
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's really bidding on this.

1276
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Sick sad world.

1277
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:11,001
[SPEAKER_03]: But the user's name is blocked whoever's bid on it.

1278
01:38:12,099 --> 01:38:14,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, part of me wants to go in or a bit on this.

1279
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,241
[SPEAKER_03]: No, do not.

1280
01:38:16,701 --> 01:38:17,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tempted.

1281
01:38:17,902 --> 01:38:18,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so tempted.

1282
01:38:19,242 --> 01:38:19,523
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1283
01:38:21,543 --> 01:38:24,565
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do I want to say real quick about... Ah, I forgot.

1284
01:38:25,785 --> 01:38:26,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Train derailed.

1285
01:38:27,086 --> 01:38:27,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, we'll move on.

1286
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:29,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Did your train sink in the ocean?

1287
01:38:29,407 --> 01:38:30,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it did.

1288
01:38:30,148 --> 01:38:31,808
[SPEAKER_03]: There was something else I wanted to say about this whole thing.

1289
01:38:32,409 --> 01:38:34,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it something I wanted to read in chat?

1290
01:38:36,571 --> 01:38:37,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was.

1291
01:38:40,845 --> 01:38:42,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for the quietness.

1292
01:38:42,425 --> 01:38:45,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading the chat here.

1293
01:38:45,966 --> 01:38:47,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Joshi16 says, I don't believe it.

1294
01:38:47,706 --> 01:38:49,847
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a quick way to sell a broken console.

1295
01:38:50,707 --> 01:38:51,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

1296
01:38:51,147 --> 01:38:58,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I can just make up a cockamamie story about... Yes, and you get it on the news and people will do it.

1297
01:38:59,169 --> 01:39:02,169
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I'm not an idiot that ruins my own systems.

1298
01:39:02,589 --> 01:39:06,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything that I have is still functional except for one 7800 that needs a new power supply.

1299
01:39:08,313 --> 01:39:13,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a console system and say it's haunted or something and come up with some sort of YouTube viral video.

1300
01:39:16,169 --> 01:39:45,025
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw says what the dad did was appalling there was a perfectly good Xbox the kids are going to be screwed when they find out there's a brand new Xbox 360 has limited backwards compatibility I know what I wanted to say earlier about the whole taking the cord thing what I found out was that when my mom would take the cord to my Nintendo that the cord from her VCR would work just fine in place of it yeah it was the old RCA red yellow things they're all the same so I would just take the cord from her VCR and it would work just fine in the Nintendo and she was not happy so

1301
01:39:46,646 --> 01:39:47,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Not happy.

1302
01:39:48,427 --> 01:39:53,189
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not condoning any other kids to be exactly as brat-tastic as I was.

1303
01:39:54,210 --> 01:40:04,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And DarkTestia, yeah, the 7800s have a really weird power supply, but they were also fairly unreliable as far as how well they stayed functional.

1304
01:40:04,915 --> 01:40:06,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you find a working one, you hold on to it.

1305
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:27,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a real big brat and I'm not ashamed of myself I'm not ashamed because my bratliness meant that I actually had a brain and was willing to use it to my own benefit and now that I'm an adult I can use my brain even better

1306
01:40:28,462 --> 01:40:30,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby says you will never grow up to amount to anything.

1307
01:40:31,003 --> 01:40:31,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy face.

1308
01:40:31,703 --> 01:40:33,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, too many people said that.

1309
01:40:33,284 --> 01:40:34,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are on the internet.

1310
01:40:34,785 --> 01:40:35,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, look at me now.

1311
01:40:35,545 --> 01:40:37,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, I'm a celebrity on the internet, so whatever.

1312
01:40:38,266 --> 01:40:39,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I do what I want.

1313
01:40:39,907 --> 01:40:42,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on, please, Loki, before we get too ghetto.

1314
01:40:43,757 --> 01:40:49,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, something that's not going to amount to anything apparently is the 2008 edition of the Digital Life Expo.

1315
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:56,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been cancelled because of poor economic conditions.

1316
01:40:56,596 --> 01:40:58,659
[SPEAKER_02]: You people are too poor, so I don't know.

1317
01:41:00,261 --> 01:41:09,950
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, apparently the last two years they had a significant gaming presence and facing lack of interest in the show.

1318
01:41:10,671 --> 01:41:16,756
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2007, Ziff Davis' apparent strategy was to put more focus on gaming for the 2008 edition.

1319
01:41:17,377 --> 01:41:20,820
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not going to happen this year, obviously.

1320
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:23,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's hoping for 2009.

1321
01:41:27,006 --> 01:41:30,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because of the recession, that's what they're chalking it up to?

1322
01:41:30,507 --> 01:41:31,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1323
01:41:32,808 --> 01:41:33,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

1324
01:41:34,189 --> 01:41:34,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess that's too bad.

1325
01:41:35,009 --> 01:41:40,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the conventions run off of pure gasoline, and so, you know, gas prices going up.

1326
01:41:40,051 --> 01:41:43,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that they had to use twigs and, you know, fire.

1327
01:41:45,273 --> 01:41:45,733
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1328
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:49,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sorry to say, but Digital Life 2008 is canceled.

1329
01:41:56,516 --> 01:41:56,937
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1330
01:41:57,457 --> 01:41:59,140
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you that had already bought your plane tickets.

1331
01:42:00,021 --> 01:42:08,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, I'm sure we have a lot of New Yorkers who are very pissed off at the news that Digital Life 2008 is canceled because there were some that used to always call in and talk to us about it.

1332
01:42:09,113 --> 01:42:12,618
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your honor, we will do the FUs of the week right now.

1333
01:42:28,669 --> 01:42:44,679
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week goes towards my husband being at the Game Crazy Manager Conference in Las Vegas and me not being able to go to Las Vegas to go to Star Trek Experience while he has to work.

1334
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:46,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?

1335
01:42:47,021 --> 01:42:48,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1336
01:42:48,422 --> 01:42:49,843
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, I actually do...

1337
01:42:52,012 --> 01:42:59,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I do miss my boy a bit, and the sad thing is that he'll be coming back Wednesday, but we'll be leaving Thursday, so I actually have to miss my art class.

1338
01:43:00,193 --> 01:43:08,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, maybe go to an hour of it, so I'm trying to think of how I can balance going to school and going to... and, you know, still getting to the airport on time.

1339
01:43:08,075 --> 01:43:13,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because you still have to get to the airport like an hour and a half early for all the check-ins and all that crap, so... Fun fun!

1340
01:43:13,436 --> 01:43:16,476
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be... I'd have to... Leave the house at four.

1341
01:43:17,196 --> 01:43:18,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you've got traffic on top of that.

1342
01:43:18,837 --> 01:43:20,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to probably miss school that day.

1343
01:43:20,637 --> 01:43:21,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, bummer.

1344
01:43:21,584 --> 01:43:22,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just finding out what I have to draw.

1345
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:48,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty beat.

1346
01:43:48,832 --> 01:43:51,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I had to wake up really early and I went to bed at 1 in the morning.

1347
01:43:52,575 --> 01:43:54,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all stuff that's my fault, but you know.

1348
01:43:56,198 --> 01:44:01,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a normal American, I'm not going to take responsibility for it anyways.

1349
01:44:02,764 --> 01:44:03,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So F you then.

1350
01:44:03,705 --> 01:44:06,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackwolf says this is why you play video games instead of real games.

1351
01:44:07,583 --> 01:44:11,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I'm trying to get out more because it's supposedly good for me.

1352
01:44:11,326 --> 01:44:13,568
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we can't have nice things.

1353
01:44:14,249 --> 01:44:16,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides, it's shooting guns.

1354
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:17,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

1355
01:44:17,411 --> 01:44:19,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't like shooting guns at people?

1356
01:44:19,673 --> 01:44:20,994
[SPEAKER_02]: And without them getting hurt.

1357
01:44:21,074 --> 01:44:21,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's awesome.

1358
01:44:22,315 --> 01:44:28,581
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you're in direct sunlight for 15 minutes, your body will make a sufficient amount of vitamin D, which you need to be healthy.

1359
01:44:28,661 --> 01:44:29,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So good for you being outside.

1360
01:44:30,042 --> 01:44:34,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I've got my outside quota done for about the next few weeks, so I'm good.

1361
01:44:37,274 --> 01:44:38,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make my FUs short.

1362
01:44:40,277 --> 01:44:41,217
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to breakups.

1363
01:44:42,378 --> 01:44:43,279
[SPEAKER_03]: They're no fun at all.

1364
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,221
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just leave it at that.

1365
01:44:46,662 --> 01:44:47,122
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

1366
01:44:48,643 --> 01:45:00,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go on, talk about other stuff, such as... A stupid award to give away tonight.

1367
01:45:02,735 --> 01:45:05,297
[SPEAKER_03]: To this woman, Kimberly Jernigan.

1368
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:09,182
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell did she do?

1369
01:45:10,683 --> 01:45:15,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she played Second Life, but that's not the only reason why we're giving her one.

1370
01:45:15,368 --> 01:45:18,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Because otherwise we'd have to give a lot of people a stupid award.

1371
01:45:19,311 --> 01:45:23,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, here's the thing, she was actually having a romance in Second Life.

1372
01:45:23,575 --> 01:45:29,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And when her Second Life boyfriend guy dumped her or whatever... Who was a lion.

1373
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:30,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a tiger.

1374
01:45:31,241 --> 01:45:32,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And bears, oh my.

1375
01:45:32,963 --> 01:45:34,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, here's what happened.

1376
01:45:34,725 --> 01:45:34,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1377
01:45:36,206 --> 01:45:37,247
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1378
01:45:58,806 --> 01:46:19,170
[SPEAKER_03]: and she was driving up from North Carolina to come kidnap this guy or whatever and she brought her dog with her the third time and so she cut the screen to get into this person's house and was waiting for him to get home from work and the dog kept barking and so what did the gal do?

1379
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:27,232
[SPEAKER_03]: She bound the dog and locked him in the bathroom so F you to this lady right here for being so cruel to animals um

1380
01:46:28,212 --> 01:46:32,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, the lion guy gets home and she had a pair of handcuffs with her and a laser.

1381
01:46:34,816 --> 01:46:36,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right, a laser.

1382
01:46:36,898 --> 01:46:39,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm going to shine it in your eyes, you little bastard.

1383
01:46:39,639 --> 01:46:39,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1384
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:44,222
[SPEAKER_03]: So finally, she runs from the scene, leaving the poor dog behind.

1385
01:46:44,923 --> 01:46:49,506
[SPEAKER_03]: She did, by the way, get caught at a turnpike rest stop in the state of Maryland.

1386
01:46:50,126 --> 01:46:51,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And there it is.

1387
01:46:54,329 --> 01:46:54,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

1388
01:46:56,826 --> 01:47:01,432
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not helping the whole stereotypes around Second Life players, seriously.

1389
01:47:01,912 --> 01:47:15,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, there was also another one I had posted as part of the stupid awards there about some stupid kid who snuck onto his grandpa's eBay account and bought a Wii for almost 200,000 euros.

1390
01:47:18,869 --> 01:47:20,950
[SPEAKER_02]: and the funny thing was he already had a Wii.

1391
01:47:21,851 --> 01:47:23,793
[SPEAKER_02]: So parents, watch your kids.

1392
01:47:24,153 --> 01:47:24,373
[SPEAKER_02]: For real.

1393
01:47:24,393 --> 01:47:25,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're bastards.

1394
01:47:26,015 --> 01:47:31,600
[SPEAKER_03]: And in regards to our recipient of the Stupid Award this week, DJ Dark Knight in chat says, that's a crazy bitch.

1395
01:47:32,912 --> 01:47:34,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't have said it any better myself.

1396
01:47:34,693 --> 01:47:38,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is she really surprised that her relationship with the lion didn't work out?

1397
01:47:38,556 --> 01:47:39,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

1398
01:47:40,357 --> 01:47:42,079
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't have ended well anyways.

1399
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:44,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And think of what the babies would have looked like.

1400
01:47:44,841 --> 01:47:48,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I am pleased to see, though, it's not just the guys becoming crazy and going after the women.

1401
01:47:59,456 --> 01:48:01,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Equal sexual representation here.

1402
01:48:01,718 --> 01:48:04,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Women are capable of going crazy too, right DarkSakura?

1403
01:48:05,601 --> 01:48:06,481
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean by that?

1404
01:48:07,562 --> 01:48:08,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

1405
01:48:10,224 --> 01:48:14,047
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need to stop that train of thought right there and just be nice.

1406
01:48:14,748 --> 01:48:15,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always nice.

1407
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the king of nice on the internet.

1408
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:18,931
[SPEAKER_09]: King of something.

1409
01:48:18,951 --> 01:48:22,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have more gaming news by chance?

1410
01:48:22,954 --> 01:48:25,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and we have good gaming news.

1411
01:48:25,516 --> 01:48:27,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very good gaming news.

1412
01:48:29,805 --> 01:48:42,991
[SPEAKER_09]: As I'm sure everyone knows by now, I've been super, super excited about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Cross Generation, which is going to be out in Japan this year.

1413
01:48:43,631 --> 01:48:50,814
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're actually talking about bringing it out on Wii because they're saying that the title will be on a Wii-compatible board.

1414
01:48:52,114 --> 01:48:52,334
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1415
01:48:53,996 --> 01:48:55,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1416
01:48:55,599 --> 01:48:56,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess maybe.

1417
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:57,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be kind of neat.

1418
01:48:58,885 --> 01:49:03,574
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would be afraid of what it would look like on the Wii because it doesn't look like a Nintendo 64 game right now.

1419
01:49:04,396 --> 01:49:05,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?

1420
01:49:06,519 --> 01:49:06,959
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

1421
01:49:07,559 --> 01:49:08,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would actually be okay on Wii.

1422
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:09,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be alright.

1423
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,680
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't want to play a fighting game on the Wii.

1424
01:49:12,981 --> 01:49:14,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not want to play a fighting game on the Wii.

1425
01:49:15,361 --> 01:49:18,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless Wii may be on the classic controller or something.

1426
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:19,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Smash Brothers.

1427
01:49:19,922 --> 01:49:24,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I want this to be out on PS3 or Xbox 360.

1428
01:49:24,423 --> 01:49:25,023
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want.

1429
01:49:26,264 --> 01:49:27,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I want an arcade machine in my house.

1430
01:49:29,404 --> 01:49:29,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Now.

1431
01:49:31,785 --> 01:49:32,945
[SPEAKER_03]: How long until this game comes out?

1432
01:49:35,706 --> 01:49:35,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon?

1433
01:49:36,994 --> 01:49:37,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

1434
01:49:37,975 --> 01:49:39,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have much year left.

1435
01:49:39,496 --> 01:49:40,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's true.

1436
01:49:41,699 --> 01:49:43,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure DarkSakura will be importing this sooner rather than later.

1437
01:49:44,414 --> 01:49:45,514
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always next year.

1438
01:49:46,675 --> 01:49:48,875
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

1439
01:49:48,895 --> 01:49:48,935
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1440
01:49:49,336 --> 01:49:56,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's another day and Nintendo's been sued again for the Wii.

1441
01:49:57,038 --> 01:50:04,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, someone else claims that they thought of the Wii first in Hillcrest Laboratories this time.

1442
01:50:04,521 --> 01:50:08,702
[SPEAKER_02]: They are basically suing them for using their motion controller inventions.

1443
01:50:09,924 --> 01:50:15,772
[SPEAKER_02]: and Hillcrest is seeking to block imports of the Wii and Wii Remote.

1444
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:17,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Why just imports?

1445
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:18,700
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of weird.

1446
01:50:19,501 --> 01:50:22,483
[SPEAKER_02]: According to a complaint filed with the U.S.

1447
01:50:22,684 --> 01:50:31,211
[SPEAKER_02]: International Trade Commission, they are also filing a civil lawsuit in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland.

1448
01:50:32,392 --> 01:50:45,783
[SPEAKER_02]: While Hillcrest Labs has a great deal of respect for Nintendo and the Wii, Hillcrest Labs believes that Nintendo is in clear violation of its patent and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights.

1449
01:50:46,881 --> 01:50:51,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And the three patents that they hold are for motion controller technology.

1450
01:50:51,324 --> 01:50:53,906
[SPEAKER_02]: The fourth is for a graphic user interface.

1451
01:50:55,087 --> 01:51:04,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess they're behind the motion control technology of FreeSpace and a graphic interface called Home.

1452
01:51:06,494 --> 01:51:09,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's the same as Sony's Home.

1453
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:09,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume not.

1454
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:16,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wants a piece of the Wii Pi.

1455
01:51:18,812 --> 01:51:19,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently.

1456
01:51:21,955 --> 01:51:24,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they should just go on Judge Judy and settle this all.

1457
01:51:24,476 --> 01:51:25,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think?

1458
01:51:26,718 --> 01:51:27,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1459
01:51:27,259 --> 01:51:32,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I know patent lawsuits take a while, but seriously.

1460
01:51:32,162 --> 01:51:35,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like two years after this console's been out and you're just now suing them.

1461
01:51:37,326 --> 01:51:39,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a hard time believing that

1462
01:51:41,161 --> 01:51:42,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a life, you know, get a real job.

1463
01:52:09,463 --> 01:52:11,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I eat morons like you up for breakfast.

1464
01:52:14,605 --> 01:52:19,607
[SPEAKER_01]: You may live, hopefully, as long as I am, but you're not as smart as I am yet.

1465
01:52:21,368 --> 01:52:21,748
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1466
01:52:21,788 --> 01:52:23,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Justice the American Way on Judge Judy.

1467
01:52:24,189 --> 01:52:24,490
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1468
01:52:26,951 --> 01:52:34,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully Nintendo doesn't get too sued, or the game that DarkSakura and I are most looking forward to, Animal Crossing City Folk, is never going to come out.

1469
01:52:35,698 --> 01:52:36,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1470
01:52:58,095 --> 01:53:06,981
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wondering if that means that you can actually take your Wii game, download the travel information to the DS, and go to a friend's house so that we don't have to haul everything over since there's no memory cards, really, on the Wii.

1471
01:53:07,401 --> 01:53:10,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess technically they have the SD card, but not a lot of people have that.

1472
01:53:10,423 --> 01:53:11,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So, kind of interesting.

1473
01:53:11,784 --> 01:53:15,887
[SPEAKER_02]: My question, and this is kind of interesting, how the fuck would you do that?

1474
01:53:15,907 --> 01:53:23,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you... I guess you could... No, you can't even really save it to your DS because there's no storage on the DS.

1475
01:53:25,894 --> 01:53:26,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1476
01:53:26,854 --> 01:53:27,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless...

1477
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,641
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1478
01:53:52,031 --> 01:53:53,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Zipper T. Bunny Bunny Day

1479
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, I wonder what Bunny Day could be.

1480
01:54:12,902 --> 01:54:15,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it be a random Sunday between March and April?

1481
01:54:16,284 --> 01:54:16,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1482
01:54:16,784 --> 01:54:20,267
[SPEAKER_09]: That was stolen from pagan religions.

1483
01:54:20,647 --> 01:54:21,908
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a fertility holiday.

1484
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:24,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

1485
01:54:49,163 --> 01:54:52,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week you send us your love and adoration and cards and letters to our mailbag.

1486
01:54:52,927 --> 01:54:54,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com.

1487
01:54:54,828 --> 01:54:58,311
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura opens up the old mailbag and reads some of her favorite emails.

1488
01:54:58,391 --> 01:55:00,353
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I remember right, there's not a lot this week, is there?

1489
01:55:00,613 --> 01:55:01,194
[SPEAKER_09]: There are three.

1490
01:55:01,454 --> 01:55:01,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1491
01:55:01,854 --> 01:55:02,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Very slow.

1492
01:55:02,415 --> 01:55:04,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Which means we got an extra during the show.

1493
01:55:04,637 --> 01:55:07,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com if you'd like to send in your emails.

1494
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:08,460
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1495
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:09,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

1496
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:12,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Sauce just said Jesus died so he can eat chocolate.

1497
01:55:12,904 --> 01:55:13,384
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1498
01:55:13,584 --> 01:55:14,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's open up the old mailbag.

1499
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:39,153
[SPEAKER_09]: The first email, um, it says, uh, Dear C4 and Kadabra and the OLR crew, I've been listening to your show since, oh my god, the spelling is atrocious, since episode one and have filled up my MP3 player for years and gave me all the gaming info before...

1500
01:55:43,066 --> 01:56:09,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Before is not spelled letter B number 4, it's B-E-F-O-R-E V is spelled T-H-E, not D-A Magazines is spelled M-A-G-I-Z-I-N-E-S, not M-A-G-A-Z-E-N-S Did, and saved me tons of cash in the year to buy You spelled anime right, what the fuck And manga, my collection, my girlfriend, cheer princess wants a D-S or P-S God, use periods!

1501
01:56:09,791 --> 01:56:10,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not reading this email

1502
01:56:11,209 --> 01:56:14,272
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you have to read the very end, because it does explain a little bit of the crappy email.

1503
01:56:14,292 --> 01:56:17,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but it was typed on a Wii, no spell or grammar check, well screw it!

1504
01:56:17,834 --> 01:56:18,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need grammar check!

1505
01:56:19,436 --> 01:56:20,797
[SPEAKER_09]: And they make a thing called a dictionary.

1506
01:56:22,178 --> 01:56:27,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they do have the mode where you type it in stuff, you start to type it in, and it spells it for you, so.

1507
01:56:29,244 --> 01:56:29,604
[SPEAKER_02]: That's lame.

1508
01:56:31,041 --> 01:56:38,529
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I was all into the soundboards as much as the chatroom thinks I am, this is the part where I would play the clip from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

1509
01:56:38,889 --> 01:56:39,951
[SPEAKER_03]: You get nothing!

1510
01:56:40,431 --> 01:56:41,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You lose!

1511
01:56:41,772 --> 01:56:42,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Good day, sir!

1512
01:56:45,129 --> 01:56:45,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

1513
01:56:45,970 --> 01:56:48,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, now I'm going to finish it because I'm a nice person.

1514
01:56:49,051 --> 01:56:49,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1515
01:56:49,311 --> 01:56:51,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm really trying to be nicer to people.

1516
01:56:51,552 --> 01:56:55,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean nothing bad against this person as a person.

1517
01:56:56,435 --> 01:56:57,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Just don't be so fucking lazy.

1518
01:56:58,716 --> 01:56:59,357
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not hard.

1519
01:56:59,457 --> 01:57:01,278
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't take that much more time to type it.

1520
01:57:01,738 --> 01:57:03,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Or to use your actual email.

1521
01:57:03,639 --> 01:57:04,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, yeah.

1522
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1523
01:57:07,121 --> 01:57:10,242
[SPEAKER_09]: She loves Myspace and mystery and roleplay games.

1524
01:57:10,342 --> 01:57:11,263
[SPEAKER_09]: What should I get her?

1525
01:57:11,343 --> 01:57:11,963
[SPEAKER_09]: PSP or DS?

1526
01:57:12,163 --> 01:57:12,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Get her a DS.

1527
01:57:14,955 --> 01:57:19,079
[SPEAKER_09]: and advice on how to get more than five listeners on my podcast, PokeFan Radio.

1528
01:57:22,242 --> 01:57:23,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Advertise, dude.

1529
01:57:23,563 --> 01:57:25,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Go out and whore yourself out.

1530
01:57:25,765 --> 01:57:35,574
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to post on all these different message boards and put a link to our podcast and our radio station and our signatures and just posted the fuck out of them, so go for that.

1531
01:57:35,795 --> 01:57:36,435
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you should do.

1532
01:57:37,456 --> 01:57:47,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and I'm, I'm very, and I feel, you know, bad that you have a level 70 and your girlfriend only has a level 10, but you do need to study.

1533
01:57:49,119 --> 01:58:00,522
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, she's, okay, to translate his email into English, he says that his girlfriend says to log off and study or he's going to drop out and live in his mother's basement.

1534
01:58:01,782 --> 01:58:01,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

1535
01:58:03,419 --> 01:58:04,520
[SPEAKER_09]: and that he sleeps in class.

1536
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:06,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Your email is quite evident of this.

1537
01:58:08,441 --> 01:58:14,344
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really a good idea if you log off of World of Warcraft and pay more attention in English class.

1538
01:58:14,824 --> 01:58:15,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

1539
01:58:17,005 --> 01:58:17,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

1540
01:58:18,386 --> 01:58:27,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm urging you to take the goddamn time to pay attention and dispel shit right and use periods and use one period.

1541
01:58:27,891 --> 01:58:28,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm going to press use one.

1542
01:58:30,071 --> 01:58:30,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, sorry about that.

1543
01:58:31,632 --> 01:58:33,193
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got a break in the podcast there.

1544
01:58:33,213 --> 01:58:36,554
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some live difficulties in the studio when I tried to play a sound clip.

1545
01:58:36,594 --> 01:58:37,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It screwed up the recording of the show.

1546
01:58:38,315 --> 01:58:43,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in the middle of Jamie's rant, which is probably to the blessing of the emailer.

1547
01:58:43,678 --> 01:58:44,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

1548
01:58:45,579 --> 01:58:50,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, during the middle of this, though, Loki and I made some special announcements that only the live listeners get to hear.

1549
01:58:50,262 --> 01:58:51,542
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1550
01:58:51,662 --> 01:58:54,484
[SPEAKER_03]: All the more reason to tune in live Sunday nights.

1551
01:58:55,816 --> 01:58:56,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1552
01:58:56,457 --> 01:58:57,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So, next email.

1553
01:58:57,558 --> 01:58:58,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Dun-dun-dun.

1554
01:58:59,179 --> 01:59:02,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Just in case you guys needed some mail, thank you, because we did.

1555
01:59:02,622 --> 01:59:04,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I'm a new listener, a.k.a.

1556
01:59:04,324 --> 01:59:08,868
[SPEAKER_09]: The56Ker, came in on episode 283, but just wanted to say, what's up?

1557
01:59:08,908 --> 01:59:09,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Your show is the best.

1558
01:59:10,209 --> 01:59:11,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to get all the back episodes.

1559
01:59:12,891 --> 01:59:16,574
[SPEAKER_09]: as possible, being as it's the only thing that gets me through the night at work.

1560
01:59:16,614 --> 01:59:17,195
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys rock.

1561
01:59:17,215 --> 01:59:18,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep on doing your thing, and I'll keep on listening.

1562
01:59:18,996 --> 01:59:22,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try to change my hours at work so I can tune in live on Sundays.

1563
01:59:22,279 --> 01:59:23,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let you know how that goes anyway later.

1564
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:32,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, you need to use capitalization and punctuation, and through is spelled T-H-R-O-U-G-H, not T-H-R-E-W.

1565
01:59:33,007 --> 01:59:33,828
[SPEAKER_03]: But thanks for listening.

1566
01:59:34,328 --> 01:59:35,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for listening.

1567
01:59:35,149 --> 01:59:36,730
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, it's time to go broadband.

1568
01:59:37,070 --> 01:59:39,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're still on 56K, you poor thing.

1569
01:59:39,613 --> 01:59:40,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor, poor thing.

1570
01:59:40,518 --> 01:59:48,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I provide these grammar and spelling lessons as a public service.

1571
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:48,840
[SPEAKER_09]: It's free.

1572
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:52,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I am trying to better the world through proper grammar and spelling.

1573
01:59:52,740 --> 01:59:53,540
[SPEAKER_03]: One word at a time.

1574
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:54,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1575
01:59:55,741 --> 01:59:57,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Last email, I think.

1576
01:59:58,041 --> 02:00:06,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Regarding your latest PSA, if Triple H retires from wrestling, would it be acceptable to walk up to McMahon and say you just lost the game?

1577
02:00:07,343 --> 02:00:07,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't think so.

1578
02:00:09,457 --> 02:00:10,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I love wrestling jokes, really.

1579
02:00:11,698 --> 02:00:12,558
[SPEAKER_09]: That made me laugh.

1580
02:00:12,658 --> 02:00:13,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Blink, blink, blink, blink.

1581
02:00:13,858 --> 02:00:14,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob doesn't watch wrestling.

1582
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:15,498
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I do not.

1583
02:00:15,538 --> 02:00:18,099
[SPEAKER_09]: He likes Glow, the gorgeous ladies of wrestling.

1584
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:21,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I like watching... It was all about Godiva.

1585
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:23,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I like watching lady wrestling.

1586
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:24,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mount Fuji.

1587
02:00:24,421 --> 02:00:29,182
[SPEAKER_03]: One night at Rocky Horror, we actually did a wrestling-themed night at Rocky Horror Picture Show.

1588
02:00:29,202 --> 02:00:30,422
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a TLC match.

1589
02:00:30,822 --> 02:00:32,622
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a tables, ladders, and cookie sheets.

1590
02:00:32,762 --> 02:00:33,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

1591
02:00:35,919 --> 02:00:36,819
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds pretty great.

1592
02:00:36,919 --> 02:00:37,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty awesome.

1593
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, also, also, last part to this.

1594
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:43,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play the a-hole guy that's in charge of the WD... What's his name?

1595
02:00:43,221 --> 02:00:43,521
[SPEAKER_03]: McMahon.

1596
02:00:43,621 --> 02:00:44,062
[SPEAKER_03]: McMahon.

1597
02:00:44,182 --> 02:00:46,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but we changed everybody's name slightly, so I was him.

1598
02:00:47,463 --> 02:00:50,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, is it acceptable to be offended by people being offended?

1599
02:00:50,644 --> 02:00:56,746
[SPEAKER_09]: What about being offended by people being... This is from Robert M. You know what?

1600
02:00:56,786 --> 02:01:02,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Just everyone needs to learn how to get over themselves and be a little bit more accepting of everybody else around them.

1601
02:01:02,908 --> 02:01:03,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1602
02:01:03,108 --> 02:01:03,648
[SPEAKER_09]: The end!

1603
02:01:04,619 --> 02:01:13,946
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us some emails and get taunted by Jamie, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Have your spelling and grammar evaluated.

1604
02:01:15,109 --> 02:01:16,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I corrected my teacher.

1605
02:01:17,110 --> 02:01:22,073
[SPEAKER_03]: You should start grading their emails based on their spelling and grammar.

1606
02:01:22,093 --> 02:01:43,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Those last two just got an E. My teacher put in the syllabus that if we can ever find any spelling or grammatical errors that he puts in any of the documentation he puts it on the website for my painter class then we get an extra bonus point for class and I found one right away and emailed it to him.

1607
02:01:43,805 --> 02:01:45,267
[SPEAKER_09]: So I now have a bonus point for the class.

1608
02:01:45,287 --> 02:01:46,248
[SPEAKER_09]: We hadn't even done anything.

1609
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:53,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get back to gaming news before we turn into the grammar podcast or whatever.

1610
02:01:54,395 --> 02:01:55,416
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a really good one too.

1611
02:01:56,197 --> 02:01:58,699
[SPEAKER_03]: We inspire you all to do more gooder on your emails.

1612
02:01:58,919 --> 02:01:59,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1613
02:02:01,101 --> 02:02:01,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1614
02:02:02,963 --> 02:02:05,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yet another rumor that came true.

1615
02:02:05,425 --> 02:02:08,889
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP 3000 was announced at Leipzig this week.

1616
02:02:10,354 --> 02:02:18,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the rumors had stated, it has a built-in microphone and a PlayStation button instead of a home button.

1617
02:02:19,522 --> 02:02:34,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Other changes that have happened, the LCD screen is a lot more responsive and also a little bit brighter or easily viewed in the highlight situations.

1618
02:02:36,683 --> 02:03:02,206
[SPEAKER_02]: and supposedly they're going to be updating the core pack which will be coming out in November which will come with a black system a 4 gig memory stick and a voucher for everyday shooter and what's kind of neat also the PSP 3000 is a little bit more rounded but that's basically it and it comes with Pi

1619
02:03:03,342 --> 02:03:04,103
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's why I won.

1620
02:03:04,123 --> 02:03:05,183
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the pie is a lie.

1621
02:03:05,323 --> 02:03:05,523
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1622
02:03:06,664 --> 02:03:08,145
[SPEAKER_03]: No free Marie Callender's pie?

1623
02:03:08,205 --> 02:03:08,726
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up with that?

1624
02:03:09,266 --> 02:03:09,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1625
02:03:10,227 --> 02:03:12,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought with everything else they were throwing in, maybe they'd throw in a pie.

1626
02:03:12,848 --> 02:03:14,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who doesn't like pie?

1627
02:03:16,420 --> 02:03:17,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like pie.

1628
02:03:37,754 --> 02:03:38,555
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, anyway.

1629
02:03:38,895 --> 02:03:40,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all happening in October.

1630
02:03:40,878 --> 02:03:51,473
[SPEAKER_03]: The games that are going to be released simultaneously, Bleach Soul Carnival, because, you know, you just need another Bleach game, and Yusha no Kusei ni Namikadikira is coming out.

1631
02:03:52,586 --> 02:03:58,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital distribution and the exact same day a PSP retail counterpart, exact same time.

1632
02:03:59,088 --> 02:04:02,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Both versions are only going to send you back 1,000 yen.

1633
02:04:02,029 --> 02:04:04,110
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about $10 or so.

1634
02:04:04,510 --> 02:04:05,690
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of interesting there.

1635
02:04:05,890 --> 02:04:06,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1636
02:04:06,391 --> 02:04:06,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that back.

1637
02:04:06,971 --> 02:04:09,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The downloadable version is actually $10 less.

1638
02:04:09,772 --> 02:04:10,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So, huh.

1639
02:04:10,872 --> 02:04:14,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if, you know, because there's no case, no manual, no disk, whatever.

1640
02:04:14,393 --> 02:04:17,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of interesting there, the approach they're taking.

1641
02:04:18,054 --> 02:04:19,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's a dangerous one or what.

1642
02:04:21,644 --> 02:04:27,329
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening in Japan, not here, so it'll be interesting to see if it sets any precedence for here, or if they try to do something similar here.

1643
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:28,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1644
02:04:29,171 --> 02:04:29,511
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1645
02:04:30,512 --> 02:04:31,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I gotta say this.

1646
02:04:31,433 --> 02:04:37,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Amaze Satsuma in chat says this, PSP 3000 came with Pi, it should be called PSP 3.14 then.

1647
02:04:37,357 --> 02:04:40,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, I get it.

1648
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:41,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what you did there.

1649
02:04:41,901 --> 02:04:42,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

1650
02:04:42,281 --> 02:04:43,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Math joke.

1651
02:04:46,580 --> 02:04:48,442
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1652
02:05:06,556 --> 02:05:25,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Well now, because it's still popular, what has been released now by TechToy, which is a Sega licensee, the Master System 3 is now out, and it looks sort of like an old Genesis, and it has a Sonic painted on it in blue.

1653
02:05:26,369 --> 02:05:28,511
[SPEAKER_09]: and like an Outline Sonic.

1654
02:05:29,171 --> 02:05:33,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has 131 built-in games on it, G-rated games.

1655
02:05:34,195 --> 02:05:35,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So it has no cartridge slot.

1656
02:05:36,437 --> 02:05:37,558
[SPEAKER_09]: And retails for about $133 US dollars.

1657
02:05:41,764 --> 02:05:46,106
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually, and I'm going to the webpage to see if it's hopefully not written in Portuguese.

1658
02:05:47,607 --> 02:05:51,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, some of the games that are on it.

1659
02:05:52,209 --> 02:05:57,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Shadow Dancer, which was one of the really good Shinobi games.

1660
02:05:57,991 --> 02:06:01,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Alex Kidd in Miracle World, Shinobi World, Lost Stars, High Tech World, those.

1661
02:06:02,932 --> 02:06:07,214
[SPEAKER_09]: You also have Enduro Racer, eSWAT, which was one of those games that was downgraded.

1662
02:06:07,774 --> 02:06:14,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2, Fantasy Zone 3, Golden Axe, Hang On, Ken Seiden.

1663
02:06:15,616 --> 02:06:17,436
[SPEAKER_09]: What's another good one that was on here?

1664
02:06:19,317 --> 02:06:19,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Thunder Blade.

1665
02:06:21,577 --> 02:06:29,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Space Invaders, Sonic, Sonic Drift 2, and Rainbow Islands, Rastan Saga.

1666
02:06:31,409 --> 02:06:32,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of good stuff.

1667
02:06:35,935 --> 02:06:37,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and Battle Outrun.

1668
02:06:39,921 --> 02:06:41,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there's lots of folks that love the nostalgia.

1669
02:06:41,962 --> 02:06:44,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure if they released something like that up here, some people would buy it.

1670
02:06:44,463 --> 02:06:49,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, hey, they do the Genesis controller type things that have all the Sonic games in them.

1671
02:06:49,565 --> 02:06:50,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Those sell really well.

1672
02:06:50,266 --> 02:06:51,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to tell you, Rob.

1673
02:06:51,066 --> 02:06:51,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not one of these?

1674
02:06:51,906 --> 02:07:04,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually am very... Even though I have almost all of the games on the list that were out as actual Master System games, I'm actually considering that this might be a worthwhile purchase for my house.

1675
02:07:06,041 --> 02:07:06,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1676
02:07:06,842 --> 02:07:07,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Add it to the museum.

1677
02:07:08,323 --> 02:07:11,166
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually download a lot of them emulated.

1678
02:07:12,408 --> 02:07:15,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, they're very solid ports of the games.

1679
02:07:15,511 --> 02:07:23,719
[SPEAKER_09]: There's even, I believe, a copy of Strider that came out on Master System in Brazil that was supposed to be pretty darn good for a Master System game.

1680
02:07:26,082 --> 02:07:28,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to hear from some of our Brazilian listeners.

1681
02:07:28,164 --> 02:07:29,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us know what you think of this.

1682
02:07:29,943 --> 02:07:31,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any Brazilian listeners?

1683
02:07:31,184 --> 02:07:31,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we do.

1684
02:07:31,704 --> 02:07:33,126
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even have to tell us what you think of this.

1685
02:07:33,166 --> 02:07:35,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say, hi, I'm from Brazil, because I'm curious if we actually have listeners there.

1686
02:07:37,169 --> 02:07:38,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1687
02:07:39,238 --> 02:07:44,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, we've got a bunch of homebrew news and hacking news to tell you about.

1688
02:07:44,662 --> 02:07:48,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So, real quickly, I'm going to mention four things that are kind of neat.

1689
02:07:48,585 --> 02:07:51,087
[SPEAKER_02]: First, Sailor Moon.

1690
02:07:51,767 --> 02:08:04,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's some guy making a few homebrew Sailor Moon games, some of which are going to be on the Wii, and they are sprite-based brawlers, which is kind of interesting, so...

1691
02:08:05,886 --> 02:08:08,667
[SPEAKER_09]: They've released actual Sailor Moon fighting games.

1692
02:08:08,707 --> 02:08:11,328
[SPEAKER_09]: My first important game was the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game.

1693
02:08:12,928 --> 02:08:23,112
[SPEAKER_02]: But, what's even bigger than that, of course, and how we cannot forget this, the Wii has been hacked to allow DVD video playback.

1694
02:08:24,492 --> 02:08:34,076
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a patch where actually you can install a program using the Homebrew channel and it will allow you to...

1695
02:08:36,049 --> 02:08:53,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Play DVDs, like DVD movies, and also the enabled DVD-capable homebrew programs such as Nintendo 64 emulators that can read ROMs straight off of a DVD disc.

1696
02:08:54,826 --> 02:08:57,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So way to go beating Nintendo at their own game.

1697
02:08:58,208 --> 02:09:00,551
[SPEAKER_03]: That is actually all kinds of funny, I have to admit.

1698
02:09:00,711 --> 02:09:02,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, who isn't thinking this is hilarious?

1699
02:09:03,013 --> 02:09:03,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1700
02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:04,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Magnetic Shaping Derby

1701
02:09:24,787 --> 02:09:26,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

1702
02:09:27,008 --> 02:09:28,349
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of interesting.

1703
02:09:28,890 --> 02:09:38,155
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's not your cup of tea, then maybe you should check out one of the many games that are available thanks to the Neo Summer Coding Competition 2008.

1704
02:09:38,315 --> 02:09:43,939
[SPEAKER_02]: They have lots of cool games for the DS, Game Boy Advance, and the PSP.

1705
02:09:44,759 --> 02:09:48,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all homebrew, including updates, of course, to...

1706
02:09:52,057 --> 02:09:53,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1707
02:10:19,073 --> 02:10:19,453
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

1708
02:10:44,149 --> 02:10:48,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight, guys, we can only get access through the Orange Lounge Radio username on Skype.

1709
02:10:48,233 --> 02:10:50,475
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how the majority of you are calling us anyway.

1710
02:10:52,397 --> 02:11:04,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that has been announced at X08 in Toronto, Duke Nukem 3D is coming out for the Xbox Live Arcade sometime in September, which is pretty cool because that means, like, soon.

1711
02:11:04,927 --> 02:11:07,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And new to Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade?

1712
02:11:08,230 --> 02:11:28,184
[SPEAKER_03]: a saved film and gameplay rewind feature I mean if you thought it was cool and braid it's going to be even more awesome when you can actually just rewind I don't know if it's the touch of a button or how that's going to work but you'll actually be able to rewind gameplay if you want to undo something you screwed up and then if you want to share with an emulator

1713
02:11:28,824 --> 02:11:29,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Like with an emulator?

1714
02:11:29,966 --> 02:11:31,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so, which is kind of neat.

1715
02:11:31,908 --> 02:11:32,989
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also save films.

1716
02:11:33,029 --> 02:11:39,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you have an especially memorable time that you shot a stripper and you want to share it with your friends, you could put it on a film.

1717
02:11:40,036 --> 02:11:41,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And YouTube's galore.

1718
02:11:42,819 --> 02:11:43,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait for it.

1719
02:11:43,980 --> 02:11:45,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Duke Nukem 3D.

1720
02:11:45,141 --> 02:11:47,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the graphics are getting a little bit of a touch-up, though.

1721
02:11:48,284 --> 02:11:49,806
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing I'm kind of looking forward to.

1722
02:11:52,016 --> 02:11:56,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.

1723
02:11:56,360 --> 02:12:03,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, if you're going to use Skype to give us a call, please make sure you have contacted Echo123 at some point before you call us.

1724
02:12:03,386 --> 02:12:04,147
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already ringing.

1725
02:12:04,788 --> 02:12:05,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1726
02:12:05,849 --> 02:12:06,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1727
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:08,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's Ranma.

1728
02:12:08,971 --> 02:12:09,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hello.

1729
02:12:09,712 --> 02:12:10,913
[SPEAKER_03]: You always seem to get through first.

1730
02:12:10,933 --> 02:12:11,634
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1731
02:12:12,731 --> 02:12:13,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Not too much.

1732
02:12:13,432 --> 02:12:15,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a few things I want to discuss.

1733
02:12:15,613 --> 02:12:17,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make everything as quick and possible.

1734
02:12:17,955 --> 02:12:18,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1735
02:12:18,455 --> 02:12:18,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1736
02:12:19,536 --> 02:12:23,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember as a kid, I got in trouble for doing something stupid.

1737
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:31,085
[SPEAKER_07]: My mother grabbed my new Tetris 2 game, the power adapter, and both my controllers and sent me off somewhere.

1738
02:12:31,685 --> 02:12:35,288
[SPEAKER_07]: When she left, I waited about a good hour after she left the house.

1739
02:12:35,388 --> 02:12:37,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I went and found myself and hooked it back up.

1740
02:12:38,250 --> 02:12:40,312
[SPEAKER_03]: She probably was not happy when she got back home.

1741
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:46,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's still a mark on the back of my back as a reminder when she discovered what I did.

1742
02:12:48,349 --> 02:12:51,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch, sorry to hear it, but bad boy, bad boy.

1743
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:55,141
[SPEAKER_03]: What else was on your mind?

1744
02:13:14,904 --> 02:13:15,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1745
02:13:15,905 --> 02:13:23,352
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't think it has anything to do with just competing expos or maybe general, like a lot of folks say that digital life was not all that last year.

1746
02:13:23,432 --> 02:13:27,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think if it's conflicting space issues that they could, I don't know, reschedule.

1747
02:13:29,329 --> 02:13:35,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because the thing was, all the second floor was going to be Digital Life, and downstairs was going to be NYAF.

1748
02:13:36,292 --> 02:13:41,295
[SPEAKER_07]: But from what I'm hearing, NYAF is going to be the entire second floor, like Comic Con was this past year.

1749
02:13:41,775 --> 02:13:46,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And from my understanding, they were letting people have free passes to Digital Life, so, you know.

1750
02:13:47,497 --> 02:13:48,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I went last year, and I had a great time.

1751
02:13:51,099 --> 02:13:51,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, who knows?

1752
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:53,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess they are rescheduling it for 2009.

1753
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:54,301
[SPEAKER_03]: No sweat off my back.

1754
02:13:57,796 --> 02:14:00,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, sucks to be the DDR people that were all excited about it.

1755
02:14:02,019 --> 02:14:02,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1756
02:14:02,859 --> 02:14:05,120
[SPEAKER_07]: For them, there's Dave and Busses and Chinatown Fair.

1757
02:14:06,161 --> 02:14:06,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1758
02:14:06,721 --> 02:14:07,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else, Ranma?

1759
02:14:08,583 --> 02:14:15,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick wrap-up of Otacon, because I know the Rob D is trying to call in to cover the game room aspect of it, so we went this year and it was great.

1760
02:14:17,412 --> 02:14:21,434
[SPEAKER_03]: What about, since you're an anime expert, what were some of the good cosplays you saw?

1761
02:14:21,854 --> 02:14:24,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'm curious about video game cosplay specifically, though.

1762
02:14:24,875 --> 02:14:29,677
[SPEAKER_07]: There was more video gaming cosplay at Otacon than anime cosplay.

1763
02:14:30,358 --> 02:14:34,079
[SPEAKER_07]: The most popular was, believe it or not, Super Mario Brothers.

1764
02:14:34,099 --> 02:14:36,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody was running around as Mario or Luigi.

1765
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:37,361
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the thing this year.

1766
02:14:38,146 --> 02:14:38,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1767
02:14:38,807 --> 02:14:42,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of seems a little like a standard.

1768
02:14:42,890 --> 02:14:47,674
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's kind of like expecting to see, you're going to see a Naruto at some point or a Sailor Moon.

1769
02:14:48,374 --> 02:14:51,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was some Sailor Moon cosplays, a lot of Naruto cosplays.

1770
02:14:51,897 --> 02:14:55,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there wasn't even as many Final Fantasy cosplays this year as normally.

1771
02:14:56,021 --> 02:14:59,483
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I guess, retro video gaming is a big thing.

1772
02:14:59,604 --> 02:15:02,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And my theory is after New Super Mario Bros.

1773
02:15:02,446 --> 02:15:04,407
[SPEAKER_07]: came out, everybody wants to do Mario Bros.

1774
02:15:04,447 --> 02:15:04,888
[SPEAKER_07]: cosplay.

1775
02:15:06,294 --> 02:15:08,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, it's not that difficult, all things considered.

1776
02:15:10,318 --> 02:15:12,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it might be kind of complicated to do a really good one.

1777
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:14,662
[SPEAKER_07]: You get someone to make the nice hat, the gloves, but you know.

1778
02:15:14,842 --> 02:15:15,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

1779
02:15:15,883 --> 02:15:16,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1780
02:15:16,403 --> 02:15:16,643
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1781
02:15:17,444 --> 02:15:22,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Ranma, thank you so much for the varied call tonight.

1782
02:15:23,469 --> 02:15:24,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, of course.

1783
02:15:24,470 --> 02:15:27,513
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have a good one, and have fun at that New York Anime Festival.

1784
02:15:27,533 --> 02:15:27,993
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be fun.

1785
02:15:28,954 --> 02:15:29,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Laters.

1786
02:15:29,475 --> 02:15:29,875
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1787
02:15:30,055 --> 02:15:30,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

1788
02:15:31,305 --> 02:15:34,227
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.

1789
02:15:34,287 --> 02:15:35,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Our 800 number is down tonight.

1790
02:15:36,128 --> 02:15:39,049
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be back in a couple weeks when we're back live taking calls.

1791
02:15:40,630 --> 02:15:41,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1792
02:15:42,851 --> 02:15:43,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up?

1793
02:15:43,392 --> 02:15:45,693
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Rob D. Well, hey, speak of the devil.

1794
02:15:45,953 --> 02:15:47,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma just talked about you in the last call.

1795
02:15:47,474 --> 02:15:48,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So you went to Otacon this year.

1796
02:15:49,035 --> 02:15:49,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Indeed I did.

1797
02:15:49,575 --> 02:15:52,837
[SPEAKER_12]: I took the 12-hour drive over to Baltimore, and that was rough.

1798
02:15:53,177 --> 02:15:53,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

1799
02:15:54,178 --> 02:15:55,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially going through Ohio.

1800
02:15:56,359 --> 02:15:56,959
[SPEAKER_12]: No offense to anyone.

1801
02:15:56,999 --> 02:15:58,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, no, complete offense to everyone in Ohio.

1802
02:15:58,940 --> 02:15:59,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Ohio sucked to drive through.

1803
02:16:01,085 --> 02:16:03,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't be as bad as some of the West Coast states to drive through.

1804
02:16:03,848 --> 02:16:05,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, have you ever really driven through New Mexico?

1805
02:16:06,871 --> 02:16:07,391
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't.

1806
02:16:07,491 --> 02:16:09,553
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some very beautiful parts of New Mexico.

1807
02:16:09,593 --> 02:16:10,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.

1808
02:16:10,194 --> 02:16:11,355
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense to the people that live there.

1809
02:16:11,655 --> 02:16:13,857
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's some parts of New Mexico they're like, damn.

1810
02:16:14,458 --> 02:16:18,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just anything east of Reno or Las Vegas and Nevada.

1811
02:16:18,622 --> 02:16:19,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty terrible, too.

1812
02:16:20,083 --> 02:16:24,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and we got a ticket while we were driving through Ohio, so that kind of taints my view on things, too.

1813
02:16:24,187 --> 02:16:24,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Ouch.

1814
02:16:24,528 --> 02:16:25,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd do it.

1815
02:16:26,718 --> 02:16:27,598
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that was beautiful.

1816
02:16:27,698 --> 02:16:32,600
[SPEAKER_12]: But as for the con itself, I posted the link to my photo album in chat, my photo bucket.

1817
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:43,423
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually see me dressed up as Terry Bogard, which I got to say, I've been to Anime Central and I went to Otakon this year and I got a much better response over at Otakon.

1818
02:16:43,463 --> 02:16:49,024
[SPEAKER_12]: I had people, I couldn't actually take like, I don't know, 20 steps through the convention without someone yelling, are you okay?

1819
02:16:49,265 --> 02:16:50,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Or hey, come on, come on at me.

1820
02:16:51,738 --> 02:16:52,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.

1821
02:16:53,159 --> 02:16:53,539
[SPEAKER_12]: It was fun.

1822
02:16:54,360 --> 02:16:55,721
[SPEAKER_12]: The game room was huge.

1823
02:16:55,921 --> 02:17:01,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just because, you know, as Ranma was saying, there's more people doing video game cosplay this year, or do you think that's why more people recognize you?

1824
02:17:01,785 --> 02:17:03,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha, I like this Metal Gear one.

1825
02:17:03,526 --> 02:17:04,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

1826
02:17:04,087 --> 02:17:07,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Two people put their little faces in a transmitter cutout there.

1827
02:17:07,749 --> 02:17:08,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

1828
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:11,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, especially with the name reference to you with Otacon and Otacon.

1829
02:17:11,732 --> 02:17:12,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, true, true.

1830
02:17:12,352 --> 02:17:14,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, there was a lot of anime stuff.

1831
02:17:15,234 --> 02:17:20,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually kept a count of how many Shinigami versus how many Akatsuki I saw, you know, from Bleach and Naruto.

1832
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:22,901
[SPEAKER_12]: It ended up being tied at 154.

1833
02:17:25,522 --> 02:17:31,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I'm trying to... Okay, wait, I found one of your Terry Bogard... Oh, you even got the hat there that says Fatal Fury.

1834
02:17:32,687 --> 02:17:33,647
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot have the hat.

1835
02:17:34,047 --> 02:17:38,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Whether it's a metal plate for Fatal Fury, or whether it says Neo Geo or Fatal Fury, you gotta have it.

1836
02:17:39,290 --> 02:17:41,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what else is there that you got pictures of here?

1837
02:17:41,872 --> 02:17:43,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucas from Mother 3, I want to see that one.

1838
02:17:45,180 --> 02:17:48,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at your photobucket, your username on photobucket if other people want to look at this.

1839
02:17:48,341 --> 02:17:52,162
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the Reobd.

1840
02:17:52,382 --> 02:17:54,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone already had the Reobd.

1841
02:17:54,323 --> 02:17:54,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, what a jerk.

1842
02:17:54,843 --> 02:17:56,704
[SPEAKER_12]: It's T-H-E-R-E-A-B-O-D.

1843
02:17:58,104 --> 02:17:58,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1844
02:17:58,564 --> 02:17:59,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a pyramid head.

1845
02:17:59,524 --> 02:18:01,465
[SPEAKER_12]: You can actually see Ranma and there's a black mage too.

1846
02:18:01,845 --> 02:18:02,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

1847
02:18:02,805 --> 02:18:03,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1848
02:18:03,686 --> 02:18:04,806
[SPEAKER_12]: You can look at the tags on the left.

1849
02:18:05,026 --> 02:18:06,166
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a tag that's Ranma.

1850
02:18:08,467 --> 02:18:10,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's got a new outfit.

1851
02:18:11,068 --> 02:18:11,628
[SPEAKER_12]: In the dealer's room.

1852
02:18:12,948 --> 02:18:13,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1853
02:18:13,409 --> 02:18:14,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't call him Evie.

1854
02:18:14,029 --> 02:18:14,709
[SPEAKER_12]: He was pawning Hentai.

1855
02:18:16,181 --> 02:18:17,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's RanmaOLR.

1856
02:18:18,582 --> 02:18:19,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, that's the old one I knew.

1857
02:18:19,782 --> 02:18:21,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you have two Black Mages in there.

1858
02:18:22,704 --> 02:18:23,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.

1859
02:18:23,504 --> 02:18:24,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, this is making for horrible radio.

1860
02:18:25,725 --> 02:18:28,026
[SPEAKER_03]: But definitely lots of video game cosplay.

1861
02:18:28,106 --> 02:18:29,066
[SPEAKER_12]: The game room was gigantic.

1862
02:18:29,086 --> 02:18:31,547
[SPEAKER_12]: There's actually a YouTube video, I think, of the game room.

1863
02:18:32,227 --> 02:18:38,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Much, much bigger than the one over at ASEN, but this one had pretty much an entire... I don't even know how to put it.

1864
02:18:38,110 --> 02:18:43,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably about... If you took a Sam's Club and split it in half, that half would be how big the game room was.

1865
02:18:45,854 --> 02:18:49,737
[SPEAKER_12]: or Costco or whatever your regional giant bulk store would be.

1866
02:18:50,317 --> 02:18:51,078
[SPEAKER_12]: And they had everything.

1867
02:18:51,698 --> 02:18:55,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of shooters, lots of fighting games, mostly, you know, most of the anime-related stuff.

1868
02:18:56,742 --> 02:18:58,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Fatal Fury, Street Fighter.

1869
02:18:59,004 --> 02:19:04,427
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw a few people dressed up as Kenso from King of Fires, which confused the heck out of me because... Kenso?

1870
02:19:04,528 --> 02:19:04,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

1871
02:19:04,808 --> 02:19:05,488
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cool.

1872
02:19:07,710 --> 02:19:12,033
[SPEAKER_12]: And they kind of wanted to hang out with me since they found another guy with KOF cosplay, but oh well.

1873
02:19:13,376 --> 02:19:15,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually trying to look at YouTube here.

1874
02:19:15,697 --> 02:19:16,797
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks like a big line.

1875
02:19:18,658 --> 02:19:18,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1876
02:19:19,058 --> 02:19:22,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to find... Yeah, I guess there's a huge line to get in the game room.

1877
02:19:24,359 --> 02:19:25,620
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never seen a Leona cosplayer.

1878
02:19:25,640 --> 02:19:29,641
[SPEAKER_12]: That would have been nice because a friend of mine and I went as Ralph and Clark at the Ascent.

1879
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:57,926
[SPEAKER_09]: well at Anime Expo two of my friends that I used to hang out with online who each had a Ralph and Clark name for a while we ended up going for the big KOF meet there but my costume is about three sizes too big for me now but I was thinking about remaking it I think my favorite picture in that whole album is Sergeant Frog as L from Death Note so great that's cool

1880
02:19:59,141 --> 02:20:21,433
[SPEAKER_12]: but um again the game room lots of stuff lots of the games you know again it's pretty much all rhythm fighting rhythm and fighting games um tons of people playing brawl i think they probably had like i don't even know eight or twelve tvs giant hgtvs playing brawl um gears of war was gears of war halo 3 and call of duty 4 were there which surprised me a little bit but you know you've got a lot of people that like to play that online so it's not too shocking i suppose

1881
02:20:23,172 --> 02:20:25,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, pretty much any fighting game you could ever want.

1882
02:20:25,853 --> 02:20:31,176
[SPEAKER_12]: KOF 98 on Neo Geo, um, KOF 11, um, what else?

1883
02:20:31,236 --> 02:20:32,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Marvel vs. Capcom.

1884
02:20:32,417 --> 02:20:37,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I said, uh, 1K we had Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Capcom vs. SNK 2, even Street Fighter Alpha 3 was there.

1885
02:20:37,879 --> 02:20:44,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just fighting game heaven, but that doesn't surprise me really, considering, you know, it's, uh, you know, anime con and all that.

1886
02:20:44,783 --> 02:20:44,863
Hmm.

1887
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:46,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, lots of rhythm games.

1888
02:20:46,390 --> 02:20:49,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Poppin' Music, DDR, I saw Beatmania there.

1889
02:20:50,892 --> 02:20:51,272
[SPEAKER_12]: What else?

1890
02:20:51,572 --> 02:20:56,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the best part about that was that those were hooked up to standard TVs instead of HDTVs, just so you didn't have the lag.

1891
02:20:57,595 --> 02:21:05,778
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of, speaking of Poppin' Music, what do you think of, I don't know if you were here during Part A, we talked about Beat and Groovy, the Xbox Live Arcade port of Poppin' Music.

1892
02:21:07,679 --> 02:21:08,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't hear about that.

1893
02:21:08,639 --> 02:21:09,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

1894
02:21:09,180 --> 02:21:10,360
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be interesting.

1895
02:21:11,401 --> 02:21:13,642
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how that will really work with the Xbox 360 controller.

1896
02:21:14,002 --> 02:21:15,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, especially with that D-pad.

1897
02:21:18,364 --> 02:21:21,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Not really my thing, and I wouldn't expect it to work very well.

1898
02:21:21,745 --> 02:21:24,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there even a 360 pop music controller?

1899
02:21:24,466 --> 02:21:25,287
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no.

1900
02:21:26,147 --> 02:21:28,528
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to be different.

1901
02:21:28,828 --> 02:21:29,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just leave it at that.

1902
02:21:30,669 --> 02:21:33,090
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Rob D., anything else you want to share about Otacon with us?

1903
02:21:34,448 --> 02:21:39,211
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got tons of stories, but honestly nothing really short enough to say here.

1904
02:21:39,932 --> 02:21:41,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, except the Kool-Aid Man made quite a stir.

1905
02:21:41,513 --> 02:21:47,696
[SPEAKER_12]: When the Kool-Aid Man went through, there was a guy with a boombox in front of him playing one of the jingles from the Kool-Aid commercial.

1906
02:21:48,717 --> 02:21:53,480
[SPEAKER_12]: It was almost like the Red Sea Party wherever he went because everyone just got out of the way and started taking pictures.

1907
02:21:54,602 --> 02:21:55,443
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome, though.

1908
02:21:55,463 --> 02:21:58,625
[SPEAKER_03]: But what the hell does a Kool-Aid man have to do with anime cons?

1909
02:21:59,145 --> 02:22:00,787
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the most random stuff, but it's awesome.

1910
02:22:00,987 --> 02:22:01,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure you've heard it.

1911
02:22:01,867 --> 02:22:02,888
[SPEAKER_12]: People are thirsty.

1912
02:22:02,908 --> 02:22:03,549
[SPEAKER_03]: They need a Kool-Aid.

1913
02:22:03,629 --> 02:22:04,810
[SPEAKER_03]: They need a Kool-Aid, absolutely.

1914
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:07,231
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, take care, Rob D. See you later.

1915
02:22:07,251 --> 02:22:07,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to you later.

1916
02:22:09,733 --> 02:22:10,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey.

1917
02:22:10,734 --> 02:22:13,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that was Fat Albert, but, you know, same thing.

1918
02:22:14,117 --> 02:22:16,158
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll take one more call.

1919
02:22:16,799 --> 02:22:17,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1920
02:22:17,819 --> 02:22:18,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1921
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:19,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Kool-Aid man.

1922
02:22:20,421 --> 02:22:20,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1923
02:22:21,622 --> 02:22:22,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, who's this?

1924
02:22:22,703 --> 02:22:23,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's Rielman.

1925
02:22:24,758 --> 02:22:25,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you're very, very quiet.

1926
02:22:26,039 --> 02:22:27,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you get a little closer to your mic?

1927
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just... Hello.

1928
02:22:31,443 --> 02:22:31,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Any better?

1929
02:22:32,323 --> 02:22:32,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1930
02:22:33,444 --> 02:22:34,665
[SPEAKER_03]: We can barely hear you.

1931
02:22:34,725 --> 02:22:36,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out your question and we'll try to answer it.

1932
02:22:38,768 --> 02:22:39,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no.

1933
02:22:39,729 --> 02:22:41,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say hi.

1934
02:22:41,710 --> 02:22:43,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where my mic is.

1935
02:22:43,992 --> 02:22:48,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I just wanted... I haven't listened to Orange Line on this radio in forever.

1936
02:22:49,055 --> 02:22:50,636
[SPEAKER_05]: And I figured tonight I'd listen.

1937
02:22:50,937 --> 02:22:52,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hi.

1938
02:22:52,618 --> 02:22:52,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1939
02:22:53,516 --> 02:22:54,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a question.

1940
02:22:54,477 --> 02:22:58,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say I'm getting raped at Dr. Mario and it's making me feel really bad about myself.

1941
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:04,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well thank you for the call and good luck finding the microphone.

1942
02:23:05,743 --> 02:23:07,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hearing too much feedback on that call.

1943
02:23:07,604 --> 02:23:11,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he said something about getting raped at Dr. Mario.

1944
02:23:11,746 --> 02:23:12,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1945
02:23:12,047 --> 02:23:13,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I misheard that.

1946
02:23:13,427 --> 02:23:13,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1947
02:23:14,148 --> 02:23:16,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, well thanks for listening and especially Mr. Hyattis.

1948
02:23:16,489 --> 02:23:17,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1949
02:23:17,330 --> 02:23:17,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1950
02:23:18,310 --> 02:23:20,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.

1951
02:23:20,892 --> 02:23:21,212
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a...

1952
02:23:22,392 --> 02:23:28,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Long time listener, disappearing for long time, reappearing for short time, and lather, rinse, repeat.

1953
02:23:28,515 --> 02:23:29,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, where the hell have you been?

1954
02:23:30,776 --> 02:23:31,016
[SPEAKER_17]: Busy.

1955
02:23:31,337 --> 02:23:31,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Life.

1956
02:23:31,777 --> 02:23:38,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Sundays are not the most free for me anymore for a number of reasons, and that's about to start over again.

1957
02:23:38,620 --> 02:23:39,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

1958
02:23:39,221 --> 02:23:41,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have had you introduce yourself for those that don't know your voice.

1959
02:23:42,242 --> 02:23:42,983
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, I'm Jason.

1960
02:23:43,163 --> 02:23:43,743
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a cool guy.

1961
02:23:43,923 --> 02:23:46,204
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm technically part of Orange Lounge Radio, too.

1962
02:23:46,324 --> 02:23:46,685
[SPEAKER_03]: You are.

1963
02:23:46,965 --> 02:23:47,285
[SPEAKER_03]: You are.

1964
02:23:47,984 --> 02:23:51,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just looking at the awesome Pyramid Head cosplay that Rob D is sharing with us.

1965
02:23:51,329 --> 02:23:52,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so what's on your mind?

1966
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:54,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've been busy, but what provokes the call tonight?

1967
02:23:55,714 --> 02:24:01,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think that Konami should not make any more music games for America.

1968
02:24:02,483 --> 02:24:02,804
Ha ha!

1969
02:24:03,684 --> 02:24:04,584
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that's it.

1970
02:24:04,644 --> 02:24:06,565
[SPEAKER_03]: They've used up all their chances.

1971
02:24:07,885 --> 02:24:08,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even that.

1972
02:24:09,346 --> 02:24:10,766
[SPEAKER_17]: I love Rock Band.

1973
02:24:10,846 --> 02:24:11,666
[SPEAKER_17]: I absolutely do.

1974
02:24:11,706 --> 02:24:15,987
[SPEAKER_17]: That game is absolutely amazing and it is way more than Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania ever were.

1975
02:24:16,567 --> 02:24:17,528
[SPEAKER_17]: I loved Drum Mania.

1976
02:24:17,648 --> 02:24:18,708
[SPEAKER_17]: I loved Guitar Freaks.

1977
02:24:19,288 --> 02:24:21,129
[SPEAKER_17]: There's an arcade here that has the both of them.

1978
02:24:21,669 --> 02:24:26,910
[SPEAKER_17]: The Guitar Freaks is first mix, so I don't really play it, but the Drum Mania is V and I go back and play it.

1979
02:24:27,722 --> 02:24:28,662
[SPEAKER_17]: It had good music.

1980
02:24:28,763 --> 02:24:29,203
[SPEAKER_17]: I liked it.

1981
02:24:29,223 --> 02:24:29,983
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a fun game.

1982
02:24:30,643 --> 02:24:38,707
[SPEAKER_17]: But for Americans, for sales and the ability to persist and survive in this market, it ain't going to happen.

1983
02:24:40,288 --> 02:24:41,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you say they shouldn't make any more music games.

1984
02:24:42,108 --> 02:24:43,469
[SPEAKER_03]: What about DDR?

1985
02:24:43,569 --> 02:24:45,570
[SPEAKER_03]: We covered that earlier.

1986
02:24:45,830 --> 02:24:47,151
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always those games coming out.

1987
02:24:47,811 --> 02:24:50,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, minus that one because that one actually got popular somehow.

1988
02:24:52,615 --> 02:24:54,819
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess it's the fact that so many other songs are English.

1989
02:24:55,279 --> 02:25:02,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so frustrating, though, because games like Beatmania had so much potential, and to see a whimper out is just very sad.

1990
02:25:02,751 --> 02:25:03,812
[SPEAKER_17]: You remember all the...

1991
02:25:05,506 --> 02:25:06,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay, tongue-tied!

1992
02:25:06,407 --> 02:25:06,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Woo-hoo!

1993
02:25:07,307 --> 02:25:10,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you remember all the hoops we had to jump through to get 7-style?

1994
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:13,092
[SPEAKER_17]: And now look how big 2DX is for consoles in Japan again.

1995
02:25:13,552 --> 02:25:14,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.

1996
02:25:14,253 --> 02:25:18,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, back then, I was highly critical of that whole thing, and I thought it was stupid.

1997
02:25:18,296 --> 02:25:19,136
[SPEAKER_17]: I absolutely remember this.

1998
02:25:19,176 --> 02:25:19,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Years ago.

1999
02:25:19,797 --> 02:25:24,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the first things we talked about on the show, probably within the first year of OLR.

2000
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:32,085
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that weren't around six years ago, basically what Konami was doing is everybody had to sign a petition or something?

2001
02:25:32,786 --> 02:25:39,671
[SPEAKER_17]: It was either 100,000 or 200,000 signatures and then 100,000 pre-orders.

2002
02:25:39,711 --> 02:25:42,793
[SPEAKER_03]: If they didn't get so many pre-orders on the official website, they weren't going to make the game.

2003
02:25:43,453 --> 02:25:44,594
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so dumb.

2004
02:25:46,615 --> 02:25:48,837
[SPEAKER_03]: The way they were just teasing us.

2005
02:25:49,417 --> 02:25:50,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it worked.

2006
02:25:50,478 --> 02:25:51,679
[SPEAKER_03]: The game eventually came out.

2007
02:25:52,259 --> 02:25:54,821
[SPEAKER_17]: and it's been doing very good ever since, at least in Japan, of course.

2008
02:25:55,621 --> 02:25:56,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that what they need to do here?

2009
02:25:56,802 --> 02:25:59,604
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're going to release another Beatmania game here, force 10,000 people to pre-order?

2010
02:25:59,624 --> 02:26:00,444
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's not going to happen.

2011
02:26:01,905 --> 02:26:12,692
[SPEAKER_17]: It's too weird and the DJ culture is, while there are, of course, a lot of DJs, music performers and whatnot, it just doesn't have the same... I don't even know what the word is that I'm looking for.

2012
02:26:12,872 --> 02:26:17,095
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not American in the sense that it's not going to take off like that.

2013
02:26:17,595 --> 02:26:19,156
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, Rock Band is traditional.

2014
02:26:19,217 --> 02:26:19,597
[SPEAKER_17]: That is...

2015
02:26:20,904 --> 02:26:22,646
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm completely and totally screwing this up

2016
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:40,971
[SPEAKER_17]: That's part of it.

2017
02:26:41,471 --> 02:26:46,316
[SPEAKER_17]: And just the manner of playing the games, how the games are played is just too different.

2018
02:26:46,776 --> 02:26:50,500
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, Poppin' Music and 2DX are very out there.

2019
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:56,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Even people who would understand what the concept of a DJ is is not going to pick up on 2DX immediately.

2020
02:26:57,086 --> 02:27:00,109
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know us, and if I can't do it now, I'm not going to do it.

2021
02:27:00,990 --> 02:27:10,917
[SPEAKER_17]: By us I mean typical people who ADHD, run through arcades, play something and then never again unless it actually gave them something special or something along those lines.

2022
02:27:11,917 --> 02:27:13,378
[SPEAKER_03]: So why Rock Revolution?

2023
02:27:14,899 --> 02:27:16,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did Konami do this?

2024
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:26,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Because Konami is in America, because Konami is supposed to be the name, game, and face of music games, and because they have to exert their fantabulousness and it's not going to work.

2025
02:27:28,743 --> 02:27:37,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Why embarrass themselves with this game when they could explore a new idea in the music game world?

2026
02:27:38,017 --> 02:27:39,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Why go through this embarrassment?

2027
02:27:39,839 --> 02:27:42,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they tried new in America and it didn't work.

2028
02:27:43,144 --> 02:27:43,945
[SPEAKER_17]: That was Beatmania.

2029
02:27:44,305 --> 02:27:45,826
[SPEAKER_17]: They're trying new in America.

2030
02:27:45,946 --> 02:27:46,847
[SPEAKER_17]: That's beat and groovy.

2031
02:27:47,047 --> 02:27:48,307
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not gonna work.

2032
02:27:48,708 --> 02:27:50,369
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're trying what was popular.

2033
02:27:50,529 --> 02:27:51,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Rock band, guitar hero.

2034
02:27:52,050 --> 02:27:53,071
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's bring a guitar game.

2035
02:27:53,351 --> 02:27:56,052
[SPEAKER_17]: But the unfortunate thing is, it's not gonna work.

2036
02:27:56,293 --> 02:27:57,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Comparatively speaking, of course.

2037
02:27:58,974 --> 02:28:00,515
[SPEAKER_03]: What about what Bobby's saying in chat right now?

2038
02:28:00,555 --> 02:28:02,657
[SPEAKER_03]: They're only doing it for the patent lawsuit against MTV.

2039
02:28:04,146 --> 02:28:06,427
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of people say that's the only reason why Supernova came out.

2040
02:28:07,088 --> 02:28:14,432
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm half tempted to believe them just because Supernova, the interface and all things associated was done pretty horribly by comparison.

2041
02:28:14,912 --> 02:28:17,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I said this three years ago until I was blue in the face and I say it again now.

2042
02:28:17,934 --> 02:28:22,196
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why In The Groove got smacked down is because they dared to enter the home console.

2043
02:28:22,616 --> 02:28:25,718
[SPEAKER_03]: If they had never done that, we'd still have In The Groove arcade machines today.

2044
02:28:26,718 --> 02:28:28,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark my words.

2045
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:29,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark my words.

2046
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:34,903
[SPEAKER_03]: If they had just kept it in their pants and not tried to invade the whole market, this would have never happened.

2047
02:28:35,283 --> 02:28:38,105
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to mark your words, but I don't have a time machine.

2048
02:28:38,125 --> 02:28:38,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

2049
02:28:39,105 --> 02:28:39,866
[SPEAKER_17]: We are not great.

2050
02:28:39,906 --> 02:28:41,567
[SPEAKER_17]: We cannot hold the button and go backwards.

2051
02:28:42,307 --> 02:28:42,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2052
02:28:42,707 --> 02:28:43,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

2053
02:28:43,408 --> 02:28:45,149
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Jason, we've got to go soon and wrap up the show.

2054
02:28:45,189 --> 02:28:45,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Any final thoughts?

2055
02:28:46,489 --> 02:28:47,950
[SPEAKER_08]: No, don't leave me.

2056
02:28:48,210 --> 02:28:49,091
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2057
02:28:49,531 --> 02:28:50,051
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

2058
02:28:50,071 --> 02:28:50,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, bye.

2059
02:28:50,652 --> 02:28:51,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, all right.

2060
02:28:51,152 --> 02:28:51,953
[SPEAKER_03]: See you later, Jason.

2061
02:28:52,033 --> 02:28:52,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2062
02:28:52,333 --> 02:28:52,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, guys.

2063
02:28:54,225 --> 02:28:56,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we always like hearing from the long time Imani fans.

2064
02:28:57,147 --> 02:29:02,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for those who didn't get through tonight, but we gotta get out of here, wrap things up, but not before we get some last minute stories.

2065
02:29:02,891 --> 02:29:04,532
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you got anything for us tonight?

2066
02:29:05,253 --> 02:29:06,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I do not.

2067
02:29:06,373 --> 02:29:08,155
[SPEAKER_09]: What, who, when, blah.

2068
02:29:08,395 --> 02:29:08,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

2069
02:29:08,835 --> 02:29:09,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, actually the ferret does.

2070
02:29:12,426 --> 02:29:13,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories tonight?

2071
02:29:13,947 --> 02:29:14,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had time.

2072
02:29:14,268 --> 02:29:15,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I said you had something earlier.

2073
02:29:15,389 --> 02:29:16,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I got time.

2074
02:29:16,330 --> 02:29:16,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it quick.

2075
02:29:17,270 --> 02:29:18,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to.

2076
02:29:19,853 --> 02:29:21,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's get started here.

2077
02:29:23,996 --> 02:29:26,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Sony thinks that...

2078
02:29:28,703 --> 02:29:30,284
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2079
02:29:51,398 --> 02:29:54,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Why they're spreading those kinds of rumors, they will never know.

2080
02:29:55,361 --> 02:30:01,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Mega Man Star Force 3 got announced at apparently the Mega Man Festival that was going on.

2081
02:30:01,266 --> 02:30:03,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there was a Mega Man Festival going on.

2082
02:30:04,308 --> 02:30:10,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be coming out in two different flavors, Black Ace and Red Joker.

2083
02:30:11,234 --> 02:30:12,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Going for the card theme there.

2084
02:30:13,736 --> 02:30:13,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

2085
02:30:15,020 --> 02:30:29,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Conduit is supposed to be shown at PAX, and they're going to be shown off at Nintendo's booth, which is kind of interesting, making you wonder, possibly, could Nintendo be publishing that game?

2086
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:30,490
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make sense.

2087
02:30:30,990 --> 02:30:33,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hope that they would do that, but who knows.

2088
02:30:35,433 --> 02:30:39,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now they're saying that they still don't have a publisher, but that could be an announcement.

2089
02:30:39,916 --> 02:30:40,396
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

2090
02:30:40,416 --> 02:30:42,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

2091
02:30:44,701 --> 02:30:45,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2092
02:30:54,526 --> 02:30:55,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Exploit, I should say.

2093
02:30:55,926 --> 02:30:58,787
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being done kind of strangely.

2094
02:30:59,067 --> 02:31:12,090
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have two hard drives for the PS3, and it will allow you to run any game as long as you have a PlayStation 3 game in the disk drive.

2095
02:31:12,210 --> 02:31:21,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure how that's going to work, but they do have kind of a video showing it being done, and I don't know.

2096
02:31:24,793 --> 02:31:35,474
[SPEAKER_02]: The Last Guy is coming out on August 28th on the PlayStation Network, so that should be pretty cool.

2097
02:31:35,514 --> 02:31:35,955
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only about $10.

2098
02:31:39,755 --> 02:31:43,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Disaster Day and Crisis may actually be coming out eventually.

2099
02:31:44,436 --> 02:31:48,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the Australian version of the ESRB has raided the game.

2100
02:31:50,015 --> 02:31:52,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it's not disappeared after all.

2101
02:31:53,158 --> 02:31:53,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

2102
02:31:57,822 --> 02:32:08,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, not to be outdone by the iPets, Nintendo is going to be getting Monkey Madness on the Wii, which is a monkey pet sim.

2103
02:32:09,571 --> 02:32:10,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can play with your monkey.

2104
02:32:12,994 --> 02:32:19,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Canami showed off a new game at Leipzig that's not scheduled to come out until 2010.

2105
02:32:19,735 --> 02:32:36,538
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a game called Lords of Shadow and kind of looks a little bit like a next-gen Castlevania because it has the main character Gabriel, who sort of looks like he could be a Belmont, fighting off some sort of monster with a flaming chain whip.

2106
02:32:37,359 --> 02:32:39,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that doesn't scream Castlevania, I don't know what will.

2107
02:32:42,108 --> 02:32:47,089
[SPEAKER_02]: and those bastards in the UK have gotten Super Mario RPG on the virtual console.

2108
02:32:47,129 --> 02:32:47,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Bastards!

2109
02:32:47,889 --> 02:32:48,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I am angry.

2110
02:32:49,670 --> 02:32:57,711
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's part of the new Hanabi Festival which they will be getting a bunch of Japanese only games.

2111
02:32:58,051 --> 02:32:59,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that will be coming over here as well.

2112
02:33:00,172 --> 02:33:06,533
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing they're going to be getting is the real Mario 2 or Mario The Lost Levels as it was called over here.

2113
02:33:07,794 --> 02:33:10,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Harmonix is teasing their next music game.

2114
02:33:10,957 --> 02:33:12,459
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't really said what it is.

2115
02:33:12,679 --> 02:33:15,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about this at the end of Part A. Oh, never mind.

2116
02:33:16,803 --> 02:33:17,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

2117
02:33:18,604 --> 02:33:19,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Fable 2, the pub games.

2118
02:33:19,986 --> 02:33:23,289
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an exploit in there where you can cheat and get lots of gold.

2119
02:33:23,669 --> 02:33:25,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're going to be fixing that.

2120
02:33:25,631 --> 02:33:30,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to still cheat, you'll just have to play it offline so it doesn't patch.

2121
02:33:33,393 --> 02:33:36,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't got a chance to play it yet, but I downloaded it.

2122
02:33:36,516 --> 02:33:40,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be having some interesting modes for the Wii.

2123
02:33:41,581 --> 02:33:48,208
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be able to put your Miis in there and play Mii Freestyle, which is kind of like Wii Music a little bit.

2124
02:33:49,109 --> 02:33:54,435
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of interesting because Guitar Hero World Tour will actually be coming out before Wii Music does.

2125
02:33:56,758 --> 02:33:57,759
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2126
02:34:20,548 --> 02:34:23,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock the Vote is going to be canvassing Xbox Live.

2127
02:34:24,571 --> 02:34:25,372
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of dumb.

2128
02:34:27,254 --> 02:34:33,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Alone in the Dark, the PS3 version, which is coming out in November, is going to be getting a whole bunch of patches to fix all the problems in the game.

2129
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:40,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thankfully, if you bought a version of the Xbox 360 version of Alone in the Dark...

2130
02:34:41,266 --> 02:34:48,810
[SPEAKER_02]: You will also be getting those same patches that will be coming with a downloadable patch probably around the time of the PS3 game.

2131
02:34:49,390 --> 02:34:55,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you have the game that long, well then, it'll be fixed.

2132
02:34:56,894 --> 02:35:00,075
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked a little bit about PS3 SKUs and stuff like that.

2133
02:35:00,496 --> 02:35:09,160
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some new announced SKUs for the UK, including a 160GB PlayStation 3 SKU with Uncharted and Pain.

2134
02:35:09,890 --> 02:35:11,693
[SPEAKER_02]: DualShock 3 for $4.99.

2135
02:35:11,793 --> 02:35:18,121
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be replacing the 80GB system that's currently available right now with Metal Gear Solid 4.

2136
02:35:21,043 --> 02:35:24,805
[SPEAKER_02]: and finally, the last thing, Red Alert 3.

2137
02:35:24,925 --> 02:35:33,731
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced the cast for the game and I gotta say it's got a lot of pretty awesome people there.

2138
02:35:33,771 --> 02:35:48,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody from Jenny McCarthy to Tim Curry to Kelly Hugh to George Takei and just a whole bunch of people.

2139
02:35:48,579 --> 02:35:49,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be really funny.

2140
02:35:52,708 --> 02:35:52,968
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2141
02:35:53,368 --> 02:35:54,549
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for last-minute stories?

2142
02:35:55,149 --> 02:35:55,609
[SPEAKER_02]: One last one.

2143
02:35:55,709 --> 02:35:56,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jesus.

2144
02:35:56,570 --> 02:35:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, sorry.

2145
02:35:57,610 --> 02:35:58,010
[SPEAKER_02]: One last one.

2146
02:35:58,390 --> 02:35:59,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this was interesting.

2147
02:36:00,131 --> 02:36:09,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, someone found a glitch in Tiger Woods 08 that would allow Tiger Woods to basically walk on water and hit a ball from on top of a lake.

2148
02:36:09,695 --> 02:36:20,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in response to that, EA decided to put out a viral video of Tiger Woods walking on water and hitting a golf ball off the water because apparently he's Jesus.

2149
02:36:23,681 --> 02:36:24,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2150
02:36:26,123 --> 02:36:28,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Completely off topic, Rob, for Christmas.

2151
02:36:29,286 --> 02:36:29,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2152
02:36:29,827 --> 02:36:32,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a Bluetooth LED keyboard.

2153
02:36:33,931 --> 02:36:34,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck with that.

2154
02:36:35,172 --> 02:36:35,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2155
02:36:35,452 --> 02:36:36,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want a pony.

2156
02:36:36,973 --> 02:36:37,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I can eat a pony.

2157
02:36:37,954 --> 02:36:38,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really want a pony.

2158
02:36:39,536 --> 02:36:40,937
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to wrap up the show.

2159
02:36:40,977 --> 02:36:44,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for us to get out of here, but not before we get everybody's final thought.

2160
02:36:44,701 --> 02:36:45,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

2161
02:36:46,742 --> 02:36:49,365
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is PAX.

2162
02:36:51,161 --> 02:36:55,065
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is pie, DarkSakura.

2163
02:36:58,735 --> 02:37:03,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, thank you guys so much for downloading us and listening to us and supporting independent podcasting.

2165

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to you guys that left nice reviews on iTunes or any other podcasting website.

2166

[SPEAKER_03]: Help spread the word.

2167
02:37:16,889 --> 02:37:19,771
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any fancy magazines or commercialized things to back us.

2168
02:37:20,111 --> 02:37:21,553
[SPEAKER_03]: We do this out of love.

2169
02:37:22,153 --> 02:37:22,433

2170
02:37:22,834 --> 02:37:27,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will see you next week at Penny Arcade Expo and back here in the OLR studios in two weeks.

2171
02:37:27,417 --> 02:37:28,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Until then...

2172
02:37:28,718 --> 02:37:30,479
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2173
02:37:47,384 --> 02:37:49,905
