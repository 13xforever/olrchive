George, Lounge, Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, August 3rd, 2008

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Will Nintendo's latest move in court stop DS piracy?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Is Jet Set Radio making a comeback on the Wii?

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And rumors abound about the Xbox 360 getting a price cut next month

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture and the gamer lifestyle

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Roar, roar, beware I hunger

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
No I'm not hunger

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm full of tasty epic salad

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
So then we should not beware

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
We should beware

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Beware of what?

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Angst?

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
See it's even worse if I don't tell you what to beware of because then you're just like extra

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I see then you're scary, you're like Silent Hill scary

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Alright say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Hello

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Good

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Alright and I see you're drinking a milkshake right now

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Yes it's one of those diet milkshakes from Jack in the Box

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Wait it's a diet milkshake?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
You know the milkshake diet, what they're not all like that?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
No I don't think a milkshake is a part of a good diet so

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Actually milkshakes can be very good for you if you do them right

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Well I doubt Jack in the Box does them the healthy way, call it a hunch

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Make them with no sugar added ice cream and protein powder and low fat milk

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Then it's only half bad

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
It's very healthy, give good dairy

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I just finished my nutrition class

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Orange Lounge Foodio everybody, welcome to it

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Anyhow let's talk about games and we always start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
First though let me introduce the one and only chat room

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com is the place to be if you're listening live on this Sunday evening August 3rd of 2008

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
For our 290th show if you can believe it

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
And old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio kind of back in the spotlight

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I'll talk a little bit about that as we move on

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
But first we gotta talk about our gaming weeks, the types of games you've been playing

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Dark soccer as always, start us off

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
We have Soul Calibur IV now

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
And I'm going to sit down and make characters tomorrow

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I haven't had a chance to actually play it yet but we have it

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Have you been watching it at all?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Ready? Yes?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Rob, this has been the last week of class

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
It's a fair question, yes or no?

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
No, this has been the last week of class for me so I actually took my final on Saturday morning and then played

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I took a hooky day though

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
What did you do with hooky day?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Watched movies

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
But you didn't play Soul Calibur fail

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
No I didn't

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I'm just kidding

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
But but but but but I did play some Portal

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And how was that?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Portal-rific!

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Alright

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And of course Ragnarok

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Ragnarok

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I have a story just for you later tonight

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I downloaded a game for my phone, I downloaded a Sudoku game

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I've been playing Sudoku on my phone

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Why?

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
How bored have you been on a scale of one to ten?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
It's actually kind of fun

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Keep in mind you can only use each number once

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
It's actually kind of fun

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Just for something when you've got three minutes to kill and

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Sudoku is a huge time waster

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
But like that's it, it's a time waster

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
If you're looking to waste time you know at least try to put your brain to work right?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I guess that's what most any game's for right?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I don't know

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Alright

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Well what about the show?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Hey wait a minute

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Alright

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Is that it for your gaming week?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yes Rob

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Tech Master Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Um

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I didn't play any of my games this week actually

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
I only played Grand Theft Auto IV

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I meant to play a bunch of stuff this week but never got around to it

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Grand Theft Auto IV and um

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
The Shit Game but we'll talk about that later

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
The Shit Game huh?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yes

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Now this isn't a game that is just shitty

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
It's actually The Shit Game

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
The Shit Game

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Is it The Shit?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
No it's Shitty

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Okay

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
But it's so fun

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Alright

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
It's so much fun

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
I wish it was longer

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Alright

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Well god I feel like I'm the only one that's actually played a lot of games this week

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I have played quite a few games

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I played Soul Calibur IV on the Xbox 360

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Ran out and bought it the day it came out

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
I don't have a Playstation 3 so I had to get it on Xbox 360

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm really enjoying the game

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I'm having a lot of fun with it especially in single player mode

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I love create a character mode

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Granted I had fun with it in Soul Calibur III

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
But I don't know I like in this one getting to kind of edit the characters that are already there

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
Getting to you know make characters based off of the existing fighting styles

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Because I'll tell you what it's really funny to have this chick with a giant afro

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Doing Young Sung's move where she does the splits and everything

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
It's really funny to me

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
The only thing that kind of stinks is that you can't have the bonus characters

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Yoda and Starkiller you can't use them or the apprentice as he's called in the game

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Which makes them sound like a Donald Trump flunky

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
But Starkiller from The Force Unleashed

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
You can't customize characters based off of them which sucks

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Because I would have loved to have made a

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I can understand Yoda

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Because you know it's kind of hard to base characters off Yoda

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Unless you're going to have midget fighters

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Which would be an awesome fighting game by the way

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
I was just thinking that you should totally make your Final Fantasy XI character

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Lil' Kim in Soul Calibur

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I could but only if I could do Yoda because she was very tiny

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
That's what I was going to say

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I mean if you could do the midget size

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Well I made Sassy Pants my Warcraft character

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I made her based off of Young Sung

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
She's the chick with the giant afro and she's quite sassy

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
And very cool

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
And I also made a male guy based off of

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
He kind of looks like Robin from the old school

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Because he has the little mask and very vibrant colors

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
But he's based off of Tyra

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Who's the hula hoop girl

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
But I gave him a very very manly voice

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
So as he's like dancing around with the little hula hoop thing

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
He's like

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
You can kiss my ass

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Things like that or whatever he's saying

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
It's really funny

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I love customization modes, it's great

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
That's the only reason why I would play wrestling games

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
To make my own character

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
So it's great

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I had a lot of fun with customization

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And online mode plays like fun

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I played DMN from understation live

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
On Saturday nights at all games radio

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I was playing DMN one night

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I played him as Sassy Pants

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Because you can use your custom characters online

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
That's so great

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
What the hell is this

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Of course he was Yoda

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Because everybody online is playing Yoda

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
He's like what the hell

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
So it was fun

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And for the record, I beat his ass

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
But no, we had a lot of fun playing Soul Calibur

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Here's the things I don't like about Soul Calibur

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I actually like the Star Wars characters

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I don't know why people are so like

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Uh, they throw things off balance

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I've never been that hardcore into Soul Calibur

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
So I don't study the game mechanics or the science

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I think it's fun

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Deal, I especially think

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Starkiller is a great, great character

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I love playing as him

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
So he's awesome to get in the game

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
By the way, if you want to unlock him

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You have to beat arcade mode with Yoda

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Or I imagine Vader on the 360

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
So there you have it

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I think he's a great addition

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
On the PS3

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
So I like playing as him

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I like the new characters

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
What I don't like, I don't like the single player modes

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Story mode is very, very short

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It doesn't need to go on forever

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
But climbing the tower up and down mode

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Which is basically just an excuse

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
To fight

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Like five people all at once

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
In a row

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And unlock things that you have no idea

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
What the conditions are to unlock them

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Until you actually do it

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Then it'll go, oh, you made it through a whole match without getting hit

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
That was the surprise, to unlock something

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Ta-da, you get a new bra for using

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Custom character mode

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I mean, that's literally what it is

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I am hearing, and I do see it a little bit

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
That some of the game mechanics

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Of some of the old characters

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Kind of got screwed up a little bit

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Like for instance, Shaoran

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Says Talim got slightly less hot

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Between two and three

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And she plays a little different too

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And Ivy, I noticed especially, plays different

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It's hard to explain

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
But some characters I still have a lot of fun with

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I want to make a character

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I love him, he's awesome

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I want to make one that's more foul than Voldo

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Here's the other interesting thing about the Soul Calibur

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
The online content

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Some of it is available and you can download

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
For just 100 Microsoft points

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
You can get some extra customization

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Which is basically like old

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Costumes

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And the cool thing is you can actually customize the existing characters

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Like change the colors of their outfits and stuff

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So that's kind of neat

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
It is pay to unlock content though

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Because it's only like 100 kilobytes

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
But it's only 100 points, that's not the end of the world

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
But here's what I thought was a little weird

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
You can also download extra

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Songs for use in stages

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
From the old Soul Calibur games

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
So pretty much there's 12 songs

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
From the old Soul Calibur games all available

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
At 100 points a pop

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Practically, or maybe even it was like 120

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
But you can get the pack of all of them for like 1200

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I apologize if I'm misappropriating those points

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
But I think it was 80 points per song

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
But you can get, maybe it was more like 16 or something

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Because you can get it for like 1200 points

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
You can get them all

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Which I think is a little silly

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
You know, why not

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Xbox supports custom soundtracks

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Why don't I like get the Soul Calibur soundtrack

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Through methods online

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Burn it to a CD, rip it to my Xbox

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Ta-da! Custom soundtracks of the old music

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
So, a little bit weak

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
So, yeah

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
The cons would be single player mode

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
But the pros would be customization

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I think the Star Wars characters are a good thing

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Despite what people say

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
They're not, they're just like

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Link being in Soul Calibur 2 on the GameCube and Spawn

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
There's something different

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
You don't have to play with them

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
But expect to see a lot of them online

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And online mode is nice

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Other games I've been playing this week

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
On the Xbox 360

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Which I would say

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Is the best game on Xbox Live Arcade right now

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I think it's great

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And it's a

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Even though they upped the price from $5 to $10

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I think it's a heck of a deal

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Because you get the six different modes in the game

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Pacifism mode

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
So much, like, that mode is fun

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
And it's weird because you don't even shoot

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
In that mode, you just fly around the screen

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Dodging enemies

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
But it's so disgustingly simple

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Like the old Atari 2600 games

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And the old 80's games

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
That was just, you know, shoot things

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Don't get hit, that's it, it's so simple

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
That's one of the reasons I think I love Geometry Wars

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Is it really kind of

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Kind of, I don't know, kind of

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Recalls those days of the past

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
These very simple video games

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And you practically have like six different games in a way

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Kind of in there

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
And I really like the way they've incorporated the leaderboard into the game

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
They've basically made the game all about

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Beating your friends

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
The achievements are interesting

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
They're a lot easier to get than they were in Geometry Wars 1

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
But like, you know, for instance

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
There's these two achievements, Wax On and Wax Off

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
And you do it in Pacifism mode

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
And the Wax On is

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Circling around the screen

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Touching every wall

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
But as you start to do it

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Then the game realizes you're going through the achievement

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And it starts lighting up the wall

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
On how much of it you've circled

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And then Wax Off is doing the same thing twice

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Which is kind of hard to do when Pacifism mode

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Gets going

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So I was pretty impressed by how they

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Kind of worked in the achievements

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I like that they made it very competitive with a friend's leaderboard

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
And I got to try multiplayer

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Which sadly is not on

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Xbox Live because we all know that's what they're going to do

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
For Retro Evolve 3, I'm sure

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
To make that fresh

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But with Retro Evolve 2 you can play at least in the same house

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Multiplayer, which is a surprising amount of fun

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Again, if you like old classic arcade games

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
With excellent graphics

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I think the graphics are so great

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
They're really a step up from

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Geometry Wars 1

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Where it really has that kind of

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Neon glow to the graphics

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
It really looks like you're playing a freaking

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Vetrex or something

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I think it's great

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I highly recommend Geometry Wars 2

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
If you even like shooters in the slightest

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
It's a great deal at $10

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I know the price went up, but you get six different games now

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
It's worth it

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Check it out, highly, highly recommend

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Besides Final Fantasy 4

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
And Warcraft and the usual affair

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
That's pretty much it for my gaming week

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
But those two are the new, new games I've been playing

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Looking at comments in the chat room

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
GS68 says

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Geometry Wars Retro Evolve 2 sequence mode

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Is reminding me of GigaWing

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Son of Dad says GigaWing should be

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
On Xbox Live Arcade along with Mars Matrix

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
As if

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
There weren't enough shooters on Xbox Live Arcade

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Mars Matrix was a cool game though

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I don't know much about that, you're going to have to

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I've got it somewhere

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I'll have to hook up the Dreamcast

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Alright, you'll have to do that

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Anyhow, let's talk about a little bit

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Of housekeeping tonight

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
First off in housekeeping

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It is All Games Listener Appreciation

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Month

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
During All Games Listener Appreciation Month

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
We're going to be giving away free shit

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
To our listeners, here's the thing

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
You're going to win tokens this month

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
That will allow you to basically

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Kind of enter a larger contest

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Going on at AllGames.com

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Where you can win prizes, they're talking about giving away

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Like game systems and games

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
It's huge, all you have to do is listen

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
We're going to be giving away three tokens redeemable

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
For various prizes, we'll have more details

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
On that next week, but definitely stay tuned

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
For All Games Listener Appreciation Month

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
You must be a forum member

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
So if you haven't already checked out the forums

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
At AllGames.com, you should be

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Be ready to win, free shit

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Sadly

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
We will not be live in two weeks

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Since this is housekeeping, there will be

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
No live show, Sunday

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
August 17th, this is the first time actually

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
The folks in the studio are hearing about this too

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Surprise, Loki

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I heard about it earlier

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
That's because I was

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Looking to win, but Loki ran through the door

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
At the last minute and I neglected to tell him

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Last minute, but like a half an hour

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I forgot, I forgot

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Here's the thing

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I don't talk about my personal life too much

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
But this is too funny to pass up

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I've been seeing William for a year and a half now

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
The thing about William and I is that we're both

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Really big nerds

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
We actually spent our first anniversary

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
We actually drove down to Long Beach and went to the

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Star Trek tour at the Queen Mary

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
That's how big nerds we are

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Well here's the thing, we've always talked about

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
How we're going to go to the Star Trek experience

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Because I haven't been since I was like 20

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Like right before I started working at my

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Current job, so it was about 7 years ago

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
So it was a long time ago when I was last at the

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Star Trek experience, and we keep talking about how

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
We're going to go back, we're going to go back because I've never ridden the Borg

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
4D ride, well then I read

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
On the internet last night

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
They are shutting down the Star Trek experience

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
On September 1st, which is so

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Sad, like, I don't know

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Why they would shut that down, it's so cool

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
So it really lit a fire

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Under our ass to go to the Star Trek

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Experience before it closes, but because

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Of Penny Arcade Expo, because of

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Some other commitment I have in Reno

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
In 3 weeks, because of the fact

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
There's a huge convention in Vegas next week

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
It really only made sense

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
We have to go to Vegas in 2 weeks, so

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
We booked a trip, and we're going to Vegas in 2 weeks

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Very last minute trip

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Thank you to the various websites

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Online, so yes I am a

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Giant nerd going to the Star Trek experience

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
In Vegas in 2 weeks, so there will be a live show

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
We might pre-tape something, I don't know yet

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Nerd. So

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
What? What was

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
By the way, for the record folks

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
The first thing that DarkSakura said

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
To me, I want to go

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I do

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I do not want to go

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I haven't seen, I haven't

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Been on the Borg ride

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Bobby Blackwolf says they're shutting it down because Star Trek

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Is irrelevant these days, bite your tongue

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
There's that new movie coming out

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
That's an awful thing to say, you take that back

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
You take that back Bobby Blackwolf

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Alright

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So I'll be in Vegas in 2, yeah

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Blackwolf says, I actually tried to see if I could

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Get to Vegas this month too

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Because I've never seen the Star Trek experience, ha!

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Anyhow

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
So 2 weeks

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And we'll fill you in more on what's going to happen that week

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I don't know if DarkSakura and Loki are going to do a show

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Or if we'll pre-tape something or what we're going to do

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
So we'll see

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I'll just burn things live on air

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
For the imagination show

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah, that'd be great

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Or the fuck show, no you can't do the fuck show without me

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
We can't do the fuck show until we're all here

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
You can't do it without me

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Alright, that's it for pretty much housekeeping

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Otherwise, join our MySpace at Orange Launch Radio

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Join our Facebook, OL Army, our live journal

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Orange Lounge

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Where else are we social hoard? Oh, we have a new one

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
If you check out the Orange Lounge Radio forums

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
The OL archive has been built

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
It's this, I don't know

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
They use SkyDrive

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Or some website where you can share

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Masses of big files

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Because I am a generous, nice, kind, giving person

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I actually uploaded

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
20 old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Old, moldy

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Stanky episodes

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Episode 20-40 I think are up there on the OL archive

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Along with some other old school

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Orange Lounge Radio stuff

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm going to warn you in advance

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
It was a much different show 5 years ago

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Be warned, if you're expecting the same stuff

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Here now, it's even worse

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
If you can believe it

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
So there you have it, the OL archive

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
More information available on our forums

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Alright, enough whoring ourselves out, let's get to some gaming news

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Yes, this week, Nintendo

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Along with 54 other developers

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Filed a lawsuit against

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I don't know

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
A lawsuit against the makers

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Of the R4 device

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
As well as, I'm assuming they're going to try to

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Expand it

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Against all the devices out there

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Basically trying to make laws passed now

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
To prevent people

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
From pirating their games

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
That's funny

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Yeah

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Don't you think that'll just make it worse, or what?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Well

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Yes, I actually

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Because of the news, I went ahead and bought another one

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Just to stick it to it

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
No, just

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Cause my wife wanted one

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
She plays puzzle games

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And I don't see

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I don't know

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Well, let me read this real fast before we talk a little more about this

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Cause this is right in the same line with us

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Talking about how, you know, you guys are running off and buying one

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
And all this

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Actually, the word is that the R4

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Pricing and the sales of them are

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Increasing a lot

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
After this whole lawsuit happened

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Apparently, in two days time

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
The price of an R4 at

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Some stores in Japan went from

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Just under 3,000 yen

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
To just under 5,000 yen

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
From $28 to $55

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Literally overnight

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
The question is, is maybe that what Nintendo was trying to go for

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Driving the price of these up

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Due to the fear

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I don't know, that seems a little counterproductive to me

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Cause it makes the demand of them go up in a way

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I don't think that's really gonna affect anything

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Because people are just buying them really fast

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And now they're just figuring, hey, we can cash in on it now

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
But

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I mean, when the demand goes back down, they're just gonna clear out their

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Inventory somewhere, and they'll still be sold

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
You know, somewhere

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
But, hey, I mean

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
At least they're taking notice of this, I guess

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
In a way, though, let's get

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Devil's advocate Loki, these devices

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Can promote piracy

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
So why should they be allowed on the market?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Well, because

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Guns can kill people, so

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
You know

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
It's not the gun killing the people

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
It's the people killing the people

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
With the guns

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
It's just like, these devices, sure, they can

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Allow you to pirate games

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
But it's the people pirating the games that are actually

19:37.000 --> 20:05.000
Pirating the games

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Well, I mean, honestly

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I don't think that they necessarily should be

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Allowed

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I mean

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
But people are gonna do it anyway

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
You know, it's, I look at it as sort of, you know

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
The whole, like, the whole

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Drug trade

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I was just saying, as you were saying,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
You know, I think

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
You know, I think

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
You know, I think

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
You know, I think

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
You know, I think

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I was just saying, as you were saying

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
That I'm almost thinking in my mind

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Like, marijuana, you know

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
A lot of people smoke pot

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I personally choose to not smoke pot

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
That's a personal preference

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But it's kind of one of those things that even though it's against the law

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
A lot of people do it anyway

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Well, that's what my thought would be

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
That Nintendo talk to the developers

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
And make multi-packs

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Of old games

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
So that, um

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You know, say you buy x number of

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
They can market something like that, or even have their own download service for old games like that.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Like virtual consoles?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, I'm talking about for the DS.

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
Perhaps they're looking at the virtual console and perhaps expanding it to the DS

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
and going to put a device similar to that to do such a thing anyways,

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
and they're worried people are going to pirate the virtual console games, which are five to ten bucks a pop.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
You know, it's not twenty dollars a pop, but still, that's a lot more games that you can fit on those cartridges

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
because those things are a few kilobytes versus 32 megs, 42 megs, and stuff like that.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
But that may be something that they're worried about.

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
Or the fact that they're worried that sales are going to dip a lot, like the PSP, because they blame piracy on that.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I blame bad games, but you know.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
But piracy, being able to play old Nintendo games on the PSP kind of drove sales in the beginning.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Jamie, I wanted to let you finish your thought before I go to chat comments.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Yes, thank you.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
My whole point is that I honestly do think that Nintendo might be looking to market something like that,

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
and it doesn't really matter because piracy is illegal, that's the end of the story.

22:10.000 --> 22:18.000
If you use something that is non-proprietary that is not sponsored by Nintendo to play copies of their games,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
it is technically theft.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
So, I don't think they're ever going to be okay, but I think Nintendo might be looking for a way to sort of market the idea for their own benefit.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
So I can see why they would want to push it.

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
Although honestly, Nintendo has had the easiest way to pirate or play imports or anything on their systems.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
Because in the past it was just a physical lockout, you adjust a tab and boom, you can play your imports on your Super Nintendo.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
You know, there were absolutely no lockouts on the old Game Boys.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
You can still play imports on the DS and you can buy those multi-game cartridges for dirt cheap.

22:55.000 --> 23:05.000
So really, the whole problem I think is that Nintendo needs to look at how they're actually allowing it, is how I see it.

23:05.000 --> 23:13.000
They've had to have built in some way because they have not been the best at preventing the piracy from going on.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
Let's look at some comments from chat at chat.orangelaunchradio.com because it's your show too here at Orange Launch Radio.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
We'd like to hear what you guys have to say.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
Blake says, it's the law of software, stopping piracy is impossible no matter how hard you try.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
ActDef says, disclaimer, use it for homebrew only as in programs and stuff, don't pirate please.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
To which I think this is kind of a good follow up comment.

23:33.000 --> 23:39.000
Joshi16 says, it would be like banning smoking pipes because you can put illegal drugs in it but you can also put tobacco in them.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
So it's kind of like how you choose to use it.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Interesting approach.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I agree with Loki though, I probably wouldn't risk my DS by using one of those.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
If it breaks, I'm screwed.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
MissingNo says, I heart the R4.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
That's the thing though, it won't hurt your DS at all because it's a device that runs on a cart.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
You're not flashing your DS, you're not doing anything to your DS.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
AlphaCananagram says, this is bullshit but if they do take down these devices, they need to leave the homebrew only flash carts alone.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
TigerClaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a homebrew up to listen to internet radio on your DS.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
GameGuru says, well if Nintendo makes their own R4, that would be cool.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
And I love this name too, the original Snake.

24:18.000 --> 24:25.000
Lieutenant Pliskin says, absolutely okay, sure it makes it possible but there are lots of homebrew and other features.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
People will always find a way to pirate.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
I thought this comment was interesting though.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Hitstun says, I guess I still don't understand how piracy is theft.

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
I'm not sure if you're being facetious but do keep in mind, you know, people get paid to make games.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
Just like people get paid to make movies and paid to write music and what have you.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
And when you take it without paying for it, that's less money.

24:48.000 --> 24:55.000
Now granted you get into this whole step, step, step thing about, you know, especially in the record industry.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
Well, how much of the money is really going to the artist and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
But, you know, regardless, you are taking money out of the system by copying.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Yes, this Dark Knight says, copy kills music.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Remember what Captain Jack always used to say, copy kills music.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
Alright, so if you have further comments on this story, mail back at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
Well, in other news, there is an interesting thing in regards to the whole piracy idea.

25:23.000 --> 25:37.000
It was actually stated by David Reeves for Sony Europe that you could download the PS3 films on BitTorrent while you're waiting for the European PSN network.

25:37.000 --> 25:49.000
So, yeah, he's actually saying that we, and this is a quote, we are a PAL market and we are going to do it in PAL and we are going to do it properly.

25:49.000 --> 25:58.000
So, he said that if you want the good quality, then you can, you know, I guess just wait for it or download it like everyone else does.

25:58.000 --> 26:05.000
It's not often you hear people acknowledging. He's an idiot.

26:05.000 --> 26:12.000
I have something I want to say about Sony, which is completely off base, so before I go on tangent, does anyone want to comment on the actual story?

26:12.000 --> 26:19.000
Okay, I saw Casino Royale for the first time last night, which by the way, I forgot how sexy Bond movies are.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Isn't James Bond just a sexy fucking franchise of movies?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I don't know, I haven't watched the last movie.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
But just in general, all the way back to the Sean Connery days, Dark Sakura?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
If you say so.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Really? I think they're hot.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
I like certain movies, I'll put it that way.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
This is how it's relevant. They hoard Sony in that movie.

26:39.000 --> 26:47.000
James Bond uses a VAIO, the cell phones were from Sony, like the movie studio to put that out, I'm sure, was Sony Pictures.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
I just lolled at the fact how much Sony was hoarded in that movie. It was just kind of fun.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Like, I noticed. Usually, I don't notice those things, but...

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
And like if we made a movie, we would be putting orange on stuff all over it?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Well, that's different.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
We're trying to buy dinner. These people have a lot of money.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Well, they're trying to buy a lot of dinner at the same time.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Alright, forget it. Move on.

27:08.000 --> 27:17.000
Anyways, so, in case you had some hope out there that Final Fantasy XIII Versus was possibly coming to the Xbox 360,

27:17.000 --> 27:26.000
Square says, no it's not. In fact, according to their video that they played during their latest kind of fan event,

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
I don't even know how you would pronounce this, DKS3713 party.

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
Anyways, they had the video for Final Fantasy Versus which said, PlayStation 3 only worldwide.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
And in small print, fuck you, Xbox 360 fanboys. No, just kidding.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
It was not coming out on the 360. Although, I'd be interested to see if that's actually going to be the case

27:50.000 --> 27:57.000
when the 360 version of Final Fantasy XIII comes out and kicks ass sales-wise.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
But, we'll see. At least it's exclusive for the meantime.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
It gives the fanboys something to hold onto, right?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Sure.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
I'm interested in Final Fantasy XIII Versus. If it stays a PlayStation 3 exclusive, I will probably have to pick up the PlayStation 3.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
Isn't anyone at all disturbed at the fact that they're releasing like four different Final Fantasy XIII games at the same time?

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
No, because they've released like seven different Final Fantasy VII games.

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
Yeah, over the course of like five years or something, but now it's just like, hey, those all sold really well.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
Let's make a lot of games all, you know, portioned apart.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
And you won't be buying them?

28:36.000 --> 28:46.000
I will be buying every single... No, two of the three. One of which happens to be on, well, one of them that I will not be buying is on the PSP.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
But, you know, that's a whole other story we already touched on.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
Let's talk about this, though, as far as Final Fantasy XIII is concerned.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
The question is when. When is this game going to come out?

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
The game will be coming out in Japan in 2009. That is confirmed.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
It was announced at Squeenix's little get-together thing they had in Japan this past week.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
Now, keep in mind that means only the PlayStation 3 version and only in Japan, because they're not going cross-platform over in Japan.

29:13.000 --> 29:19.000
However, it will be out in 2009, and then they're going to start the localization and the port for the Xbox 360,

29:19.000 --> 29:27.000
which probably means we'll see it in 2010, because when they say they're going to get it in 2009, that probably means Christmas of 2009.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
But we'll see. We could be pleasantly surprised. Who knows?

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
All I know, I can't wait to see what the game actually looks like.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
We'll see.

29:39.000 --> 29:48.000
Well, in other news related to Squeenix, they actually have a bunch of games that are going to be coming out for the DS in Japan,

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
and they're calling this new line Pure Dreams.

29:51.000 --> 29:59.000
There are two games that are going to be the first two out. One is Snoopy DS, Let's Go Meet Snoopy and His Friends,

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
and then Pingu Waku Waku Carnival.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
I don't really know much about these games, except one of them is Snoopy, and the other one has a funny name,

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
but there's no release date for them in anywhere but Japan, and it just says Autumn.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
Really, it should be called Fozzie Waka Waka Carnival.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
That's Waku.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
I know.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Okay.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
He was making a bad joke.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
That was a really bad joke.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm going to throw a tomato at Loki.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
At least it's a lot better than, I don't know, a Snoopy game.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Peanuts are still very popular overseas.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
Peanuts are still very popular in my house. I love peanuts.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
You know what will never stop being awesome? Ever? Snoopy snow cone machines.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Those are the greatest thing ever.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
See? I rest my case.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
Loki, remember? Remember when we lived together and I bought one?

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
And it took me like an hour to make a goddamn little slushie?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
To be honest, I don't remember that at all.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I think that was a bastard.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
No, seriously, I think you did that at your other apartment.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
No, I'm almost positive it was when I lived with you.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
We were buying all sorts of random shit.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
I remember when you got the deep fryer for your birthday.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
That was a Christmas gift, okay?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Okay, Christmas.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
And yes, I remember it because it was awesome. The only problem was it wasn't as awesome as it needed to be for deep frying.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
And that apartment did not have any sort of ventilation, which also sucked for deep frying.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
I really like video games. I just thought I'd let you guys know that.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Really? Well good, I like deep frying and we're going to talk about that some more.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Let's deep fry some video games.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Yeah. Whatever.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Let's see.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Not deep frying.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
Dark Tetsuya says, good grief, Rob.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
Alright, well something that's not Snoopy related, but a lot cooler.

31:46.000 --> 31:55.000
Japanese Advent Children fans are going to be happy that a brand new Director's Cut will be coming to Blu-Ray soon.

31:55.000 --> 32:00.000
And with it will be coming the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
And with that will also be coming a new PS3 bundle.

32:04.000 --> 32:12.000
All this is supposed to happen March 2009, and I don't know. I'm excited.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
May have to import it.

32:14.000 --> 32:23.000
So is it just me, or is it one of those things where I should have known the whole time this is why Final Fantasy VII Advent Children was kind of short?

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
This was just coming the whole time.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Bonus! 20 minutes deleted footage or whatever.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Sucker. I should just tattoo it on my forehead.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
I should everyone else who bought it.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
I would also like to remind listeners of the show not to text me while I'm doing the show. Thank you.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I get that too.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Especially when I don't know who you are.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
I don't get that because I turn my phone off.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Well good for you.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
Alright, the PSP game which Loki earlier referred to is that kind of missing Final Fantasy XIII game.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
You've heard a lot about Final Fantasy XIII and Versus XIII.

32:56.000 --> 33:03.000
Well there's also Agito XIII is coming out as well. Agito. Agito. Agito.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
It's a cell phone game.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
That's the one that was supposed to be the cell phone game.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
However, it's apparently also heading to the PSP.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It's part of the big franchise.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
I think this is great. It's going to allow the PSP to, especially in the US where our cell phones aren't going to be able to run it.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
I'm sure it's going to allow this to reach a much broader audience here.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
I'm sure the success of Crisis Core had something to do with that as well.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
So, more multi-platformism in the Square Enix world.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
And this game soon to be on the PSP. Well not soon.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
But eventually, one day, far in the future, to be on the PSP.

33:35.000 --> 33:42.000
Well speaking of which, I don't know if anyone remembers that the latest Parasite Eve game was supposed to be exclusive on mobile phones.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
Well, Squeenix actually said that it will be out on PSP.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
And it doesn't say anything about there being a mobile phone version in development.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
But it's called The Third Birthday.

33:53.000 --> 34:02.000
And they had some sort of trailer of it up that has the main character Aya in a wedding dress.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
So, I don't know. Oh, with a gun.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Well, because you have to have a gun.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
You have to have a gun.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
I was going to say, this is a franchise people have been waiting for for a long, long time.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I think it's been bigger since the last one.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
It's been a long time.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Will she be in her birthday suit?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I wish they'd translate the novel.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
Yeah, that's right. There was like a novel. Wasn't there something else that was like a cell phone game or something?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
There was also a live action movie.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
There was a movie. I've got the movie somewhere, but I haven't watched it yet.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
But my friends read the novel a couple of times and it says it's pretty good.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
I saw the movie. It was pretty cool.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I don't remember much of it though.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
I remember your mitochondria are full of evil.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Son of Dad in chat says, Parasite Eve 2 is kind of a let down.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Well, I didn't play it.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
Um, let's move on.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Alright.

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
Well, we're still waiting for home. Still.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
But the Japanese home beta has finally opened up.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
And they've added some interesting things to it as well.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
Including some Namco arcade classic games.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
Including Pacman, Dig Dug, that sort of stuff.

35:10.000 --> 35:17.000
That will be playable in the arcades that are strewn about the home interface.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
So they'll have the first few games that they mention Pacman, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Xevious.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
And there will be three secret titles that are still on the way.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
Mappy for the win.

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
You know what? One good thing about this though, and I assume you don't have to pay to play these games,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
is that you don't have to pay to play these games.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
That's a hell of an assumption, by the way.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Yeah.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
Wouldn't it be interesting if you, because a lot of people thought this should be Xbox Live's prize model,

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
wouldn't it be interesting if you have to insert a quarter, quote unquote, to play the games?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I will not be playing those games, then. That's the case.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
Because I have them on 360.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
Dark Soccer, I'm kind of curious what you think about the Namco games being in home,

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
because, you know, I know you're an avid collector of the museum games,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
so it kind of feels like we've had to buy them before, and now they're going to be free, maybe?

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
If they're free, I'll get them. If not, I don't care.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
I mean, if they're not, I'm just not going to get them. I've got 50 million other copies.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
I have an actual cartridge of Mappy somewhere in my house, so it doesn't really matter.

36:18.000 --> 36:25.000
I've actually got, I think, almost the entire Namco PS1 collection.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
That was the letters, right? M-A-M, yeah.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Although I'm still trying to find the trademark for the Japanese releases.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Ooh.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Yeah, I still had a hard time with that.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Pooface in chat, I love that name, says,

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
I hope that's not how the Xbox Prime Time games will work.

36:38.000 --> 36:43.000
Interesting thought. We haven't heard anything about how that 1 versus 100 or any of that stuff's going to work.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
So, who knows?

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
ActDef says, free is good, except for Yaris.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
I want to say those Prime Time games are probably going to be free,

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
and they're going to probably finance them with advertisements.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
You know, that makes sense, I think.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah, advertisements will make sense.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
It just, oh man, it's going to be just like the old Acrophobia days.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
I can't wait.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
That's how the Berkeley Systems games were funded, too.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
Anyhow, not all the news in Squeenix Land is good this week.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
We have a crap ton of Final Fantasy news, but this is also Final Fantasy related.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
It has to do with Final Fantasy XI.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Oh, remember my old crack?

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
Remember Final Fantasy XI, the old crack game?

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I try not to.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
Well, how hard was it for you to cancel Final Fantasy XI when you finally did it?

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Not that hard.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
I didn't find it to be that hard, either.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Do you remember, Loki?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
It was fucking easy.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Yeah?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
It was just like stupid easy.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Well, here's the thing.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
Apparently, someone does not agree, and the name is Alex Edwards, and he is actually kind

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
of, it's not so much a lawsuit, but what has happened is one thing has led to another.

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
There is now a new Illinois law that mandates that MMO providers have to make an online

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
cancellation option available, that you have to be able to do it online.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
It is online.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
That's what I was thinking, but here's the deal.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Here's how the story goes.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
This guy was playing Final Fantasy XI.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
He grew tired of the game.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
His parents were paying $13 a month, and they tried to cancel the account online, but the

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000
claim is that Final Fantasy didn't offer them a way to do it online, didn't offer a contact

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
phone number, so finally, they went to the credit card statement to get the phone number,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
spent an hour and 45 minutes on hold.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
Finally, someone answered the phone, and they got it canceled.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
That's just because they're stupid.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You have to do it through Play Online.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
They're retarded.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
They're absolutely retarded.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
You don't do it through the website.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
You do it through Play Online.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
I bet what happened is he uninstalled all the crap, and then was like, and you know

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
how awful Play Online is to uninstall, and then it was like, oh crap, I can't delete

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
it from the website.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
I was supposed to do that on Play Online.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Well, duh, that's what the instructions say, and you have a manual.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Hi.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
Well, maybe in that regard, does it have some merit then that you actually have to still

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
have the game installed to be able to cancel it?

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
I mean, to be honest, you don't for Warcraft.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
You can do that all on the website.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
It's super easy.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
I mean, if you can't figure out how to cancel, wow, you're dumb.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
I mean, it's really, really easy to cancel, wow.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
He just pissed off that there's no big, giant button that encompasses the entire screen

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
that says, to cancel, click here.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
The easy button.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
I mean, seriously, it was not that hard to figure out how to cancel.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
It wasn't hidden in menus.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
It was so easy.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
It was right on the Play Online screen if you wanted to cancel it.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
And obviously they had to have signed up for an account, and it's done the exact same way

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
as you cancel it, so they're retarded.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
I'm sorry.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
And the fact that this went all the way to become a law, wow.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
It's a case of people overcomplicating a simple issue.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Hey, folks in Illinois, I hope that you're happy that your tax money's being used this way.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Just because I wanted to read the summary of the actual law.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
An Internet gaming service provider that provides service to a consumer for a stated term

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
that is automatically renewed for another term, unless a consumer cancels the service,

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
must give a consumer who is an Illinois resident a secure method

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
at the Internet gaming service provider's Web site

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
that the consumer may use to cancel the service,

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
which method shall not require the consumer to make a telephone call

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
or send US Postal Service mail to effectuate the cancellation,

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
and two, instructions that the consumer may follow to cancel the service

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
at the Internet gaming service provider's Web site.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.520
site. Makes it an unlawful business practice for an internet gaming service provider to

40:25.520 --> 40:29.300
violate the new provisions. Now is it just me though, or was it a heck of a lot easier

40:29.300 --> 40:36.300
to cancel Final Fantasy XI than it was to cancel America Online? Maybe I'm crazy, but

40:36.540 --> 40:41.780
at least they weren't begging me to stay. Actually, if you call them and do it, they'd

40:41.780 --> 40:46.620
try to get you to stay by giving you free months. On Final Fantasy XI even? No, on...

40:46.620 --> 40:51.500
Oh, oh yeah. Oh yeah, America Online tries to pull it all out, so... I was like, um,

40:51.500 --> 40:58.500
my account was already free. Retention. Anyhow, so, there you have it, new laws. Ridiculous.

40:58.700 --> 41:05.700
Oh my god, this is stupid. But anyway, how about some release dates? Like, three items

41:05.800 --> 41:11.800
coming out on the 8th in Europe. We have Beijing 2008, the official video game of the Olympic

41:11.800 --> 41:18.800
Games on PC, Race Driver Grid on DS, and The Mummy Tomb of the Emperor on Playstation 2.

41:18.800 --> 41:25.800
That's it. Sorry. I can't say that the US is much better. This week we have the King

41:27.280 --> 41:34.280
of Clubs, which is some crappy golf game on the Wii. There's Summer Athletics, I believe

41:35.700 --> 41:42.300
the 360 version coming out this week, for some reason it was delayed from last week.

41:42.300 --> 41:47.920
Rock Blast, which is a DS puzzle game. Monster Madness, Grave Danger, which apparently is

41:47.920 --> 41:54.360
a slightly upgraded version of the Monster Madness game that was on the 360. So, I don't

41:54.360 --> 42:01.360
know what you get when you upgrade crap, but I'm probably guessing it's not that great.

42:04.080 --> 42:10.360
And yeah, B-Boy is also coming out this week on PS2 and PSP. And to be honest, I think

42:10.360 --> 42:16.200
that's about it. I mean, slow week. Wow, is it just me, or is it kind of a slow release

42:16.200 --> 42:23.200
week in general over there? Well, it's slow because of Madden coming out next week. Ah,

42:23.360 --> 42:27.080
yeah. That's the game I don't get too excited about. Oh, there's a Cheetah Girls game coming

42:27.080 --> 42:34.080
out, my mistake. How could I have missed that? Damn, fired. I know, seriously. Why am I not

42:34.900 --> 42:38.800
keeping up with the Cheetah Girls games? Well, in Japan we have a lot of stuff coming out.

42:38.800 --> 42:42.380
They also have a sports game coming out this week. It's NBA 2K8 is coming out in Japan

42:42.380 --> 42:46.900
on August the 7th, as well as Tales of Vesperia comes out. There also is a super premium pack

42:46.900 --> 42:50.440
for Tales of Vesperia coming out this week. I believe that is the one that comes with

42:50.440 --> 42:54.600
the Xbox 360, if I'm not mistaken. I think there was a bundle pack coming out in Japan.

42:54.600 --> 42:59.120
Don't quote me on that. Also, a PlayStation 3 version of NBA 2K8 is being released this

42:59.120 --> 43:06.120
week. Moving on to the Nintendo Wii. Survival Kids Wii. I wonder if that's lost in blue.

43:06.400 --> 43:11.800
It is lost in blue. Yeah, I think it is. Yes, it's lost in blue on the Wii. So that's coming

43:11.800 --> 43:18.800
out. Imabikiosu Kamihan comes out as well on the Wii this week from Sega. And this game

43:20.000 --> 43:27.000
looks to be, what the heck, it looks like it might be kind of a horror type game on

43:27.200 --> 43:30.720
the Wii. Looks like the graphics are pretty cool. Got some neat little cut scenes there.

43:30.720 --> 43:34.800
I don't know, that's either a horror game or a dating sim. But seeing as it looks like

43:34.800 --> 43:38.920
it's a horror game. Yeah, it looks like a horror game, but seriously, in this one screen

43:38.920 --> 43:44.760
you have ABC choices. That looks like a dating sim to me. It's a super emo horror game. That'd

43:44.760 --> 43:51.760
be awesome. A horror dating sim. I think the brains at the O.L. Army headquarters need

43:53.040 --> 43:58.920
to get to work on a horror dating sim. Not a whore, but a horror. On the PlayStation

43:58.920 --> 44:02.480
2, God of War 2 gets a price reduction this week in Japan, moving into the best price

44:02.480 --> 44:09.480
series. Also, Grim Grimoire and Sengoku Barasa 2 Heroes also move into that same series.

44:10.440 --> 44:16.760
Some new games coming out this week. True Tears is coming out as well as Aokoro no Kusabi.

44:16.760 --> 44:22.760
Hiro no Kakeru 3 comes out in Japan this week, which is, looks like some type of role

44:22.760 --> 44:29.080
playing-ish game. You play a dude with a sword. I don't know, it kind of looks like a dating

44:29.080 --> 44:36.080
sim. Why would he have a sword if it's a dating sim? Because all cool kids have swords who

44:37.160 --> 44:43.680
date, because if it goes bad, you know, they can commit suicide. Just stop. Just stop.

44:43.680 --> 44:48.440
Hey, I just wanted to mention real quick that in a couple weeks, actually, we're going to

44:48.440 --> 44:54.880
be getting Lion Rider 2, which is exciting for the DS and the Wii. On the Nintendo DS,

44:54.880 --> 45:01.880
Monster Farm 2 DS in Japan this week, as well as Fire Emblem. Shinankoku Ryotun Hikari no

45:03.280 --> 45:10.280
Ken comes out this week, as well as Choshiotu Kadukistu, which is a game from Atlus, comes

45:11.160 --> 45:17.960
out on the Nintendo DS this week, which, oh, it's Trauma Center 2. Nice. You finally get

45:17.960 --> 45:24.960
that in Japan this week. Coming out on the Sony PSP, just some price reductions on Quiz

45:25.040 --> 45:32.040
Mobile Suit Gundam Tonsenshi, as well as Daisenryaku Portable 2 and Doku Maki Murikai. They all

45:33.920 --> 45:39.460
get price reductions this week, but as far as new games go, Crazy Taxi Double Punch comes

45:39.460 --> 45:44.080
out on the PSP this week in Japan. That's happy. Get ready to make some crazy money.

45:44.080 --> 45:48.920
That's it for your Japanese release dates. Back to some gaming news. Well, in other gaming

45:48.920 --> 45:55.700
news, and this actually isn't necessarily just Just Just Game, but this is for our cosplay

45:55.700 --> 46:02.160
people as well. Gamefly is having an open casting for the next commercial, so they actually

46:02.160 --> 46:08.680
want cosplayers to send them videos saying why they love Gamefly, and why the character

46:08.680 --> 46:15.680
that they're dressed up at is their favorite. But, you know, I think it's going to be kind

46:16.680 --> 46:21.760
of iffy, but here's the details if anyone wants it. There are live casting calls that

46:21.760 --> 46:28.600
are going to be in LA, New York, and Chicago. That's in September, and you actually send

46:28.600 --> 46:35.600
a 45 second entry after August 26th. As far as more information on this, the live casting

46:35.600 --> 46:41.600
calls are September 9th, Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Highland Center, and that's 12 to 6 p.m.

46:41.600 --> 46:48.600
PST. September 16th in Chicago, ESPN Zone on East Ohio Street from 12 to 6 central time,

46:50.600 --> 46:57.600
and September 23rd, New York at Hawaiian Tropic Zone on 7th Avenue and 49th Street at 12 to

46:58.600 --> 47:03.600
6 p.m. EST. All those cosplayers are going to fit right in at Hollywood and Highland.

47:03.600 --> 47:10.600
I actually told Rama the minute I read about this, I went to Twitter and I posted, Rama,

47:11.600 --> 47:15.600
Black Luigi needs to be in this commercial. Make it happen. So he said he's going to go,

47:15.600 --> 47:20.600
so I hope if he... Cover it for us. Yeah, cover it for us. I want to know if it is any

47:20.600 --> 47:26.600
good or if it seems like a scam or whatever, but I think it'll be good. I want lots of

47:26.600 --> 47:30.600
photos from this event. You know people are going to go just for the photo ops because

47:30.600 --> 47:35.600
that's like half the big thing about cosplay is your photo ops too. Any excuse to be on

47:35.600 --> 47:39.600
TV, people are going to go nuts. You know people are going to see these commercials

47:39.600 --> 47:45.600
and go, what? Yeah, I know. But there will be other people that get it. Hey, cosplay

47:45.600 --> 47:51.600
opportunity, go for it. Exactly. Hey, cosplayers can get like actual real recognition in the

47:51.600 --> 47:56.600
real world. I think it's a good thing. So there you go. Loki is going to be giving us

47:56.600 --> 48:00.600
a massive homebrew update tonight. What is this? There's like massive amounts of news

48:00.600 --> 48:06.600
in the homebrew world. Just a bunch of little small things. Okay, so first off we're going

48:06.600 --> 48:11.600
to start with the Wii. If you've never done homebrew or are having trouble figuring it

48:11.600 --> 48:17.600
out, they actually have a website now that'll make it a lot easier for you and it's presented

48:17.600 --> 48:22.600
by Wii Brew and it's the Wii Pack generator and what it does is it allows you to kind

48:22.600 --> 48:28.600
of toggle different things you want to be installed in one giant zip file and you download

48:28.600 --> 48:34.600
it and you drag and drop it to your SD memory card and if you have Twilight Princess you

48:34.600 --> 48:38.600
can use the Twilight Hack to install the homebrew channel and a bunch of different homebrew

48:38.600 --> 48:43.600
programs on there and they've got a huge list of stuff and they keep adding more to it so

48:43.600 --> 48:48.600
definitely the way to go if you haven't done homebrew stuff yet or if you just want to

48:48.600 --> 48:53.600
take it easy to find all your programs in one spot. Rob I think will get some use out

48:53.600 --> 48:59.600
of this but they have the Any Title Deleter. It's a space-freeing program for the Wii.

48:59.600 --> 49:06.600
It allows you to remove previously unremovable tiles including the weather and news channel.

49:06.600 --> 49:10.600
Unfortunately though if you have any games that have updates they will reinstall them

49:10.600 --> 49:17.600
for you. But I like the weather channel because I like the music. What about the news channel?

49:17.600 --> 49:22.600
Okay news channel is kind of a waste. Okay so you can remove stuff if you want to and

49:22.600 --> 49:25.600
some other things like that and they have protection so you don't break your console

49:25.600 --> 49:30.600
and that kind of thing. One thing though that is a little bit more risky but you can do

49:30.600 --> 49:35.600
it as well with this is the Wii Region Changer. You can actually use this device to change

49:35.600 --> 49:40.600
the region of your Wii so that it's a Japanese console. Of course everything will be in Japanese.

49:40.600 --> 49:44.600
There is some risk involved with it though. You have to read the instructions very carefully

49:44.600 --> 49:48.600
because you can actually break your console with this if it's not done right.

49:48.600 --> 49:54.600
So don't do it. Yeah. Just don't. Just don't. There's region free players on the Wii so

49:54.600 --> 50:02.600
just use those instead. Guitar Fun which is the Fretz of Fire game that they have now

50:02.600 --> 50:09.600
for the Wii and that of course for those who may not know is a Guitar Hero sim or emulator

50:09.600 --> 50:14.600
I guess. And you can import custom songs and all sorts of things. Well the new version

50:14.600 --> 50:20.600
2.9 has come out. It's still in beta but it now has online support and so they have

50:20.600 --> 50:26.600
instructions on how you can set up your PC or router I guess to be able to play online

50:26.600 --> 50:30.600
with other people. So that's kind of neat though. You can do online. I don't know if

50:30.600 --> 50:35.600
you can actually do online on the Wii with Guitar Hero 3. I think you might be able to

50:35.600 --> 50:42.600
but either way it's so cool. Now for the PS3. It's actually interesting. There's some

50:42.600 --> 50:46.600
sort of a homebrew scene actually starting up on the PS3 now that people figured out

50:46.600 --> 50:52.600
that you can use the Blu-ray Java dev kit to actually create programs that can run on

50:52.600 --> 51:00.600
the PS3 and no modding is needed whatsoever because it's running off the BDJ Java that's

51:00.600 --> 51:05.600
built into any Blu-ray disc. So it's already built into the system and so people are actually

51:05.600 --> 51:09.600
creating like Pong programs and all the simple stuff that comes out in the very beginning

51:09.600 --> 51:14.600
but it's only going to lead to more and the best part you know they aren't really going

51:14.600 --> 51:19.600
to be disabling it anytime soon since it's built into all the Blu-ray discs so basically

51:19.600 --> 51:26.600
you just load the programs onto a jump drive and away you go. So that's pretty cool. And

51:26.600 --> 51:34.600
let's see. And that's it. Alright. Lots to do in the homebrew world. Yes. But I don't

51:34.600 --> 51:38.600
have time for homebrew unless there's something really really good that I'm really missing

51:38.600 --> 51:42.600
but lately I haven't been that excited about it. Well there's actually one thing that they've

51:42.600 --> 51:46.600
been kind of trailering on a bunch of websites this week. Remember that game I was playing

51:46.600 --> 51:52.600
before called No Gravity? It was a homebrew PSP game that was kind of a space shooter.

51:52.600 --> 51:57.600
Like a 3D space shooter. It's actually now becoming a full game on the Playstation Network

51:57.600 --> 52:02.600
that's going to be downloadable via them. You actually have to pay for it now. But you'll

52:02.600 --> 52:06.600
be able to download it to your PSP and play it but it's the first time that a homebrew

52:06.600 --> 52:12.600
game like this has become downloadable on the Playstation platform so that's kind of

52:12.600 --> 52:18.600
neat. And hopefully they'll be coming soon. Okay. Well I wanted to read this comment from

52:18.600 --> 52:24.600
chat. Going back to the cosplay gamefly commercial thing. SSJ100Matt I believe was the one that

52:24.600 --> 52:32.600
said this. Manfay. Could Manfay make an appearance? Manfay would either be scary or fantastic.

52:32.600 --> 52:39.600
That's kind of both extremes don't you think? I want the male Utena cosplayer to show up

52:39.600 --> 52:44.600
who looked perfectly female. I wish I lived in New York with Rama because I'd go and dress

52:44.600 --> 52:51.600
as Black Mage. So maybe we could both be in it. I'm not sure what Black Mage has in common

52:51.600 --> 52:58.600
with Luigi but you never know. I am very excited about this upcoming game and Dark Sakura.

52:58.600 --> 53:04.600
I don't know about you but maybe you'll play this with me. Sing Star Musicals is a new

53:04.600 --> 53:10.600
rumored game to be coming out. Supposedly it's going to be coming out in 2009 and some

53:10.600 --> 53:15.600
songs that are rumored to be in it. Bad Guys from Bugsy Malone. Can You Feel the Love Tonight

53:15.600 --> 53:20.600
from The Lion King. If I Were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof and Over the Rainbow from

53:20.600 --> 53:27.600
Wizard of Oz. However I need this song to be in it. If at all possible.

53:27.600 --> 53:44.600
Oh not Springtime for Hitler. No you should find the one from the movie. Is that the one

53:44.600 --> 53:51.600
from the movie? No. It's just because John Barrowman sang the one in the movie. I don't

53:51.600 --> 53:56.600
think they have the one from the movie on iTunes. The recent movie because well I think

53:56.600 --> 54:01.600
he's wonderful. So yeah this is a rumored game that's going to be coming out. That being

54:01.600 --> 54:05.600
said I actually think this rumor is bull. I think this rumor is a load of crap. I don't

54:05.600 --> 54:10.600
believe that it's true. One of the big reasons I don't think it's true is that this rumored

54:10.600 --> 54:15.600
song list has Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King. Disney owns that and if

54:15.600 --> 54:20.600
Disney was going to put that in a game Disney would be making a Disney game. Disney I don't

54:20.600 --> 54:24.600
think would be likely to loan this out. One of their biggest songs. I mean granted I don't

54:24.600 --> 54:27.600
know I guess Elton John wrote it so maybe there's a way around it. And it's not really

54:27.600 --> 54:32.600
a musical either. Actually yes they did a Lion King musical. I know they did but it's

54:32.600 --> 54:36.600
Disney's musical. It's not Sony's you know what I mean and I don't think Sony would be

54:36.600 --> 54:40.600
able to license that from Disney. Does that make sense? I don't know if it's necessarily

54:40.600 --> 54:46.600
Disney that owns Soul Rites. Plus I mean would there really be that many people that are

54:46.600 --> 54:53.600
going to buy this? I mean maybe. I would. I would too but we're kind of weird. So? Okay

54:53.600 --> 54:58.600
then again I guess Poofy said they made Sing Star Bollywood so I guess anything's possible.

54:58.600 --> 55:04.600
Well yeah. Well then again I mean that would. That makes sense though for a European release.

55:04.600 --> 55:08.600
It does. It does. And maybe this isn't something that's going to be coming out here. Maybe

55:08.600 --> 55:11.600
this will be coming out in other areas where Sing Star is bigger. Well if it's a Sing Star

55:11.600 --> 55:18.600
game I would suspect that it would be a European release. Well I still want to import it. This

55:18.600 --> 55:24.600
will be fun. Well you know there's also been a big surge in West End theater now. Especially

55:24.600 --> 55:29.600
with those shows that they're doing now. Sort of like an American. Well not like. Sort of

55:29.600 --> 55:35.600
like a pop idol though for musicals. How do you solve a problem like Maria? And the other

55:35.600 --> 55:39.600
one. Hey that was a John Barrowman show. Yes it was. I'm thinking you're a fangirl. I'm

55:39.600 --> 55:45.600
a little bit of a fangirl. But it just seemed to me that theater's having such a bigger

55:45.600 --> 55:50.600
resurgence overseas that it could be possible that that's why there'd be a Sing Star game.

55:50.600 --> 55:54.600
So I could sort of see it happening. I do have one other request for Sing Star musicals.

55:54.600 --> 56:00.600
You are ruining my song. Oh me sorry. Me no mean to. Well if you wouldn't mind please

56:00.600 --> 56:07.600
being quiet for a minute so I can finish. Okie dokie. Good. I'm glad we have this new

56:07.600 --> 56:17.600
technology. For porn. Which gives us untold opportunity. For porn. Oh sorry. God it'll

56:17.600 --> 56:25.600
never get old. Avenue Q is playing in town Rob. We need to go seriously. I know. For

56:25.600 --> 56:31.600
porn. We've said that as the previous cage match winner if I do recall correctly. I'm

56:31.600 --> 56:37.600
sure. I think it was a cage match winner at one point. Love it. And a very good question

56:37.600 --> 56:42.600
from chat. Very very good informed question. SSJ100Matt says Rob what about Sing Star

56:42.600 --> 56:49.600
Rocky Horror Edition? Yes please. That would be hot. How do you do I? See you've met my

56:49.600 --> 56:57.600
faithful handyman. But it has to have an audience participation subtract. Yes. But people

56:57.600 --> 57:01.600
and you know this. Do you know how much money I would pay for Loki to sing Sweet Transvestite

57:01.600 --> 57:06.600
Live on Air? I would put money in that pot seriously. I totally would. You should just

57:06.600 --> 57:13.600
sing it for us right now anyway. In a single costume. We're waiting. No. Chirp chirp chirp.

57:13.600 --> 57:17.600
Alright Sing Star musicals hopefully coming to a Playstation near you. I have something

57:17.600 --> 57:23.600
that's even more in the special category if we can get on to our next segment. We absolutely

57:23.600 --> 57:27.600
can. It's a segment we love to do every week. It's very special. It's the classic video

57:27.600 --> 57:30.600
game of the week. Dark Soccer will dig through the archive and tell you kids what you should

57:30.600 --> 57:37.600
be playing. What should the children be paying a little respect to this week? The game of

57:37.600 --> 57:46.600
the week is Jumping Flash. Nice. I love Jumping Flash. But I've mentioned this show on air

57:46.600 --> 57:54.600
many many many times. When I first moved into my college dorm room I was put in charge of

57:54.600 --> 58:01.600
my friend's boyfriend's Playstation. And he had Jumping Flash and I played the hell out

58:01.600 --> 58:07.600
of it and it was an awesome game. So the story behind this and I love this. That a demented

58:07.600 --> 58:15.600
astrophysicist named Baron Aloha removed pieces from earth with land lifting machines

58:15.600 --> 58:25.600
and so this cute little electric bunny named Robin has to use these jet pods to you know

58:25.600 --> 58:31.600
I guess break these jet pods and get the little islands back to earth. What? Can I just say

58:31.600 --> 58:36.600
to son of dad in chat this is not Jumping Jack Flash with Whoopi Goldberg. No. This

58:36.600 --> 58:41.600
is different. Stop it. Anyway the way that the game plays is it is very first person

58:41.600 --> 58:50.600
and I will tell you that this totally totally made me motion sick as hell but it's great.

58:50.600 --> 58:55.600
Actually the article makes a note that it's actually just like a game called Geograph

58:55.600 --> 59:01.600
Seal which is for the Sharp X68000 so I'll have to look for that later on. But anyway

59:01.600 --> 59:06.600
you play as Robin looking through Robin's eyes and you've got a screen showing you how

59:06.600 --> 59:12.600
much time you have remaining and your score and the sidekick called Kumagoro which gives

59:12.600 --> 59:19.600
you hints and warnings and helps you out. You've also got fireworks items as your sort

59:19.600 --> 59:24.600
of like your firing mechanism, power ups, jet pods, all this other neat stuff that goes

59:24.600 --> 59:29.600
with it. But so the big thing about it though is you have to jump and you can make him jump

59:29.600 --> 59:35.600
three times. You can jump off the ground twice in mid air and you can get really high over

59:35.600 --> 59:44.600
the ground. And instead of though being faced horizontally when you jump the camera tilts

59:44.600 --> 59:50.600
down towards the ground. So it's, you see why I'm talking about getting motion sick

59:50.600 --> 59:57.600
there too? But you can also use your enemies to bounce off of in some cases. But you get

59:57.600 --> 01:00:02.600
different fireworks for attacks like cherry bombs, rockets, roaming candles, and twisters.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:09.600
You can get time extensions, you can get different jet pods that are EXIT and so when you get

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:15.600
them you go to the exit pad and you can leave the level. You also have hidden levels, you

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:21.600
have a roller, the roller coaster level was fun I have to say. And you have a time attack

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:28.600
mode so you can try to get out of the levels in a certain amount of time. There also was

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:35.600
a sequel that was called Jumping Flash 2 that did not do as well. But it was still a fun

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:42.600
game. And apparently there were pseudo sequels that were only released in Japan. There was

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:50.600
Robert Mundo on Playstation and Pocket Moomoo that was on Pocket Station and they were released

01:00:50.600 --> 01:01:02.600
by Sugar and Rockets whereas these were actually released by Exact. Was Baron Aloha in Project

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.600
Moomoo or Pocket Moomoo? I actually do not know, I have not played Pocket Moomoo. It

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.600
sounds like someone needed a vacation in Hawaii. But I came really close to actually importing

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:17.600
Robert Mundo once. I guess now I could find it a lot cheaper I'm sure. But it's actually,

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:24.600
you can get Jumping Flash at the Playstation store. And coming soon the next sequel, Captain

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:32.600
Uma Uma Nuka Nuka Appa Waha. Never mind. Bad joke. Oh come on Ferret. I never actually

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.600
played Jumping Flash. You didn't! No I never did. I have Jumping Flash in the massive old

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.600
Playstation cases. Keep in mind, Playstation 1 era was around the time I was in college.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.600
So the only Playstation 1 games I really got into, yeah but I kind of left gaming for a

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.600
little while. I really only was playing like Final Fantasy 7 and Puzzle Fighter. I didn't

01:01:53.600 --> 01:02:01.600
play a whole lot during that era. Puzzle Fighter came out years after. At any rate, if you

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.600
want to play this game then I will see about locating my copy of it and bringing it over

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:12.600
or something. But it's really, it's cheese ball and it's you know, it's early Playstation

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:18.600
but it's a fun little game. Alright. That's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.600
Radio with that Jumping Flash, your classic game of the week. We're going to take a quick

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.600
break but we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after some music for the

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.600
live listeners. And actually if things get sent to me in time here we'll do some music,

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.600
oh yes we're going to have some music on the podcast as well tonight as well. I'll tell

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.600
you a little bit more about that in just a minute. But we'll be back with more of Orange

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:47.600
Lounge Radio.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:52.600
Hey all our listeners, this is GS68 with a public service announcement. When playing

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.600
Super Smash Brothers, do not have fun. Do not play with items on. Items ruin the balance

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.600
of the game and add randomness. Do not pick low tier characters. You will not win them

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:07.600
with them no matter what. The best balance repair will always lose to the worst fox player.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.600
The only stage allowed is Final Destination. If a stage has more than a flat plane on it,

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.600
it's bad. It ruins the balance of the game by giving characters advantages. Take your

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.600
episode of gimmicks and shove it. Huge stages like Hammer Castle for camping morons. Even

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.600
Smashville is barely acceptable but there's a freaking moving platform on top of the main

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.600
platform. And finally, remember, I don't care if you're at a party and just want to have

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.600
fun with your friends. Video games are not about fun. They're about winning. So shut

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.600
the fuck up and stop having fun because video games are serious business. Thank you and

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.600
good night. This PSA was brought to you by Mushroom Kingdom, one of the never-ending

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600
scrolling bullshit.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Be sure to navigate through the forums and find the

01:03:50.600 --> 01:04:19.600
O.L. Archive, where you can find such clips as this.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:29.600
Oh yes, the good old days of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.600
That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter closet, wasn't it?

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.600
I think so. I think it was one of those weekends back when Karaoke Revolution was funny.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.600
Anyhow, thanks to our listeners who provided the bumpers that break. GS68 was the first

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:47.600
one and PKJR92 did the second one. So thank you guys so much for those bumpers. If you

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.600
have a bumper you want to send, go look at the forums. There's a whole post about us

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:57.600
accepting things for our free break and that would be fake PSAs, promos for non-profit

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:02.600
shows and things like that and so on. So hope to get some stuff from you.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:06.600
Meanwhile, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:13.600
the 3rd of 2008, for more Orange Lounge Radio gaming news, gaming chat, gaming bitching

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.600
and whatever we can come up with. Loki, how about some Xbox news?

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:25.600
Yeah, so there's another rumor coming out. Yeah, another one. I know. This one actually

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:33.600
has come from Ars Technica and apparently they have their Microsoft insider who lets

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:39.600
them know all the wonderful rumors and information and stuff like that. They were ones, I believe

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:45.600
he was the one that was kind of clueing people in on that 68 model that was going to be introduced.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:54.600
Well now, apparently sometime in September, there is going to be another price drop and

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:58.600
it's going to be dropping. This is actually the price drop because if you remember the

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:03.600
last one was kind of the phase out 20 gig models but I guess by that time they'll be

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:11.600
all gone. What's going to happen is the Elite is going to drop down to $399 from $449 so

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:18.600
that's a pretty nice drop there, another $50. The 68 system will drop down to what the

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:28.600
Pro system is now for $299 and the Arcade system will drop from $279 to $199. So that's

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:34.600
pretty cool. And apparently around that time also the hard drive, the 120 hard drive is

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.600
supposed to drop in price and I think probably the 60 as well will be coming out at some

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:45.600
point. And the other interesting thing about that that kind of coincide with all that is

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:55.600
there was some screenshots on VG charts apparently from the inside of their, some system, I don't

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:01.600
know what store this is from but it's saying that the price drop is going to happen confirmed

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:08.600
on the Arcade system on September 7th, 2008. So that seems to give us a little more legitimacy

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.600
than when this rumor usually flies around because I was just about to ask, what makes

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.600
this any different from any other price cut rumor? Yeah, and well what's interesting though

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:21.600
September 7th, that's another Sunday and they like to drop them on Sundays so they can have

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:25.600
the ads and everything. And if you think about it, it makes sense too because everyone's

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:31.600
saying, oh it's because the exclusives are coming out for the Xbox 360, you know Infinite

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:38.600
Undiscovery and Rock Band 2, well a time exclusive for Rock Band 2, but I say it's because the

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.600
Playstation 3 exclusives are going to be coming out around that time too. Actually they're

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:50.600
going to start coming out with a lot of their big Playstation exclusives around October

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.600
7th and if they kind of get a jump on everything, especially now that they're talking about

01:07:54.600 --> 01:08:03.600
putting out a core 80GB system out there for $399, you know it's kind of funny though,

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:10.600
it just kind of nullifies all that. Well I say they're doing it to be ready for Christmas

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.600
and also to get down there to where the Wii's at because now they're going to be the same

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:22.600
price. Almost. Right? The Wii's, is Wii 199 or is Wii 250? Wii's 250. Oh, see they're

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:27.600
going to be cheaper than the Wii at this point, that's huge. Yeah. That's really huge I think.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.600
Do you think Nintendo's going to have to follow suit? No. I guess not, Wii's are still in

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.600
demand. Because they're very, I would say they're very arrogant, so unless the Wii system

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:41.600
takes some hits as far as sales goes, then they may. I don't think they are because they're

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.600
still high in demand and they're selling over retail anyways, so people have no problem

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:51.600
paying the $400 for a Wii system right now. I don't know why you would, but they are.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.600
Alright, well we'll see. I'm sure it will drive sales come Christmas time if they do

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.600
end up doing that. And I'm sure this is only a rumor because none of these rumors ever

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.600
come true. I think there seems to be a lot of truth in this. I think we all know Xbox

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.600
is going to cut the price and to really get below Nintendo I think is going to be huge

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.600
for them. So we'll see. Anyhow though, I want to talk about this one reason that might sell

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:21.600
a lot of Xbox is zombies. I love zombies. We don't have enough zombies on Xbox. I mean

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.600
yeah, we have Dead Rising, but we don't have zombies on Xbox Live Arcade that I can think

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.600
of. And when I talk about zombies, I'm talking about the actual tabletop game Zombies. I

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.600
don't know if you've ever seen this game. It's an actual tabletop game that kind of

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.600
uses cards. And you know, tabletop games have been kind of popular on Xbox Live lately.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.600
I mean you have Carcassonne, Catan, Ticket to Ride. You know, why not? Let's get zombies

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.600
in there as well. And this actually had to do with a gamer who was actually like sending

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:55.600
ideas on how to turn a zombie game into an Xbox Live Arcade game. Well apparently, according

01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:01.600
to a joystick report, that's joystick with a Q, they actually ran into Todd Breitenstein.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:06.600
He's from Twilight Creations who actually made the tabletop game. Ran into him at Comic

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.600
Con, which happened recently. And in response to are they going to make a zombies game for

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:16.600
Xbox Live, got the ever famous I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a project.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:23.600
But don't you think it would be cool? And the answer is yes. Zombies are always cool.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.600
Zombies are fantastic. So there you have it. Chat room, what do you think? Yes or no to

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.600
zombies on Xbox Live? I'm all for more of the board game type fare on Xbox Live Arcade

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:37.600
too. I think those games are fun. Well, and other fun. And this makes me particularly

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:45.600
happy because you know I love Valve. Right? Well, you know that there's going to be a

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:52.600
Portal Still Alive coming out on Xbox Live, but it looks like Valve is really considering

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:58.600
bringing other titles from their services. So I think that's pretty cool. And that they

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:05.600
actually don't yet have any immediate plans to try the Wii or PS3. So hey, they love you

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:13.600
Microsoft Xbox owners. You have the love of Valve. Indeed. Very much. But you do not have

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:19.600
GLaDOS in this one. And that is not as great. So do you think it's kind of a money milking

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.600
thing? Kind of a cheap... Well, all business is money milking when you think about it.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.600
Yes, that's true. Only if you're a non-profit organization do you not look to make a profit,

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:34.600
right? True. Commenting to a question Lieutenant Pliskin asked in chat says, can you put a

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.600
hard drive in the no hard drive model of the 360? Let's say you want to download Portal

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.600
Still Alive and these other possible future Valve releases. Yes, you can. You can put

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.600
a hard drive in the core model. It's very easy. Actually, when I first got an Xbox 360,

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.600
I actually bought mine when they were really hard to come by and Best Buy was only getting

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:55.600
like five of them at a time. And when I got there, they didn't have elites. I was only

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.600
able to get a core so I actually paid the slight extra money to get the core and the

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.600
hard drive with it. Which at the time was worth it because you couldn't get an Xbox

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.600
360 really. It was so hard. And then to put icing on the cake, I got the Red Ring of Death

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.600
three days later. Remember that? Good times. Because I came on here and I bitched, whined

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:17.600
and moaned on the show so bad. I was so pissed. But all is better now in Rob's world. Especially

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:26.600
after the yumminess of Soul Calibur IV and Geometry Wars 2 this week. You know, I'm going

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.600
to have to get that Geometry Wars, I think. At least get the demo. The demo from what

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.600
I hear is almost the full deadline mode which is get as many points as you can in three

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.600
minutes and it's a really good way to test if you're going to like the game or not. So,

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:46.600
at least get the demo. So, let's move on. Okay, shit. Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:52.600
over there. Well, you guys were still talking about freaking Geometry Wars. I was waiting.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:59.600
Anyways, so, you may remember that the Bourne Supremacy just came out beginning of June

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:06.600
and stuff and that was part of the whole VinVidi license and stuff, actually Sierra Entertainment.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:12.600
Well, now that they've been purchased by Activision and Blizzard have merged together, they're

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.600
starting to, or Activision and VinVidi and Blizzard and all those companies have merged

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:22.600
together, they're starting to kind of go through what franchises they own and kind of slim

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:31.600
it down a bit. And one of those franchises, of course, is the Bourne Supremacy and, or

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:36.600
Bourne Conspiracy, I'm sorry. And actually the whole Bourne lineup. In fact, there's

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.600
some other stuff about that as well. But they're actually giving back the Bourne Conspiracy

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:47.600
to Lundrum Entertainment, you know, because Robert Lundrum, of course, was the guy that

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.600
wrote the Bourne books. So, it's kind of going back to them and I guess, I don't know if

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:58.600
they want to put any other games out, they have to find a new publisher, I guess. Interesting.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:04.600
Well, you know, it didn't just stop there with the Bourne series. Activision and Blizzard,

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.600
they're kind of looking at some of the other franchises as well. And some of the franchises

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.600
that were rumored this week, Brutal Legend, Ghostbusters, the video game, were supposed

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.600
to be lost. It actually came out a little later in the week, that is not true. Ghostbusters

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:23.600
absolutely not canceled, according to Vivendi Sierra, not canceled. That is still happening.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.600
The spokesperson for Sierra had actually said, quote, first and foremost, the game is not

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:32.600
canceled. However, the game may not have a publisher right now. That was a little more

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:40.600
in the blue there. Also, Brutal Legend is fine. So, that series is still supposed to

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:45.600
be on the way. Well, it's really weird, though, that they would keep Spyro, Crash, and all

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.600
that stuff and get rid of, I don't know, the good games. Spyro's kind of a money machine.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.600
Yeah, and they kept 50 Cent, Blood in the Sand, or whatever that thing is. That game

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:59.600
sounds very interesting. Chronicles of Riddick, apparently, was booted to the curb, too. Yeah,

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.600
I mean, that, I think, was a long ways away, anyways. Well, I just hope they didn't get

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:09.600
rid of the Island of Dr. Brain, am I right? What? Because the Island of Dr. Brain was

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:16.600
an awesome Sierra game. If you say so. Remember, it was probably like a year ago, we had those

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:21.600
kids that were making the Silver Lining, remember that, the unofficial King's Quest sequel,

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.600
the Silver Lining? And then they went through that whole song and dance where they had to

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.600
lose the King's Quest ties, and now the game is just being released as the Silver Lining.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:33.600
I wonder if all this recent, you know, Mergy-merge news means maybe they can get away with doing

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.600
it as a King's Quest game again. I doubt it, but it's still nice to imagine. I suppose,

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:45.600
if you want to keep dreaming. Yeah, I know. But hey, if we didn't have Dreamers, we also

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:50.600
wouldn't have Bums, so, kidding. Lieutenant Pliskin makes a very excellent point in chat,

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:57.600
chat.orangelsonsray.com. 50 Cent greater than Chronicles of Riddick? Both great. Question

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.600
mark, question mark. You know what we need, speaking of like movie franchises from like

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.600
10 years ago. What? When I went to see The Dark Knight the other day, they were showing

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:11.600
on the screen a preview for Starship Troopers 3. Why did we never get a video game for that?

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.600
I think there were video games. There was a PC game. Yes. We need more. And there's a

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.600
comic right now. I know there's like comics and other types of things, but no good game

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:27.600
where you can just go blow up bugs in the good old American way. Forget it. I tried.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:34.600
Anyway, well you know, I'm not sure if everyone's familiar, but there were screen captures and

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:40.600
video out for Soul Calibur IV that was showing Darth Vader and Yoda in the same game, which

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:48.600
as we knew, Yoda was in the Xbox 360 edition and Darth Vader was in the PS3 one. And the

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:56.600
director of the game, Katsutoshi Sasaki, said that they don't have any plans for making

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:02.600
either one downloadable content for either console. But then again, apparently those

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:08.600
screen captures and the video that was out are supposed to be legitimate. You know, actual

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:16.600
same versions of the game. So, maybe that was just like a... I would assume that in

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.600
programming both characters would have been included, right? So it might just be from

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:26.600
the developer's kit or something. You know, it could be either from the developer's kit

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.600
or there's a rumor floating around and you really would have to read in between the lines.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.600
This guy is saying it's not going to be download content, right? But some of the rumors that

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.600
are going around say that you will actually, if you buy The Force Unleashed, the game that

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:43.600
The Apprentice or Starkiller is actually starring in, it unlocks the other Star Wars character

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.600
on your respective system. That's smart. It's an interesting way of doing it. It's a way

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.600
of saying, hey, buy this game and please don't think that it sucks. And so, you know, no,

01:17:52.600 --> 01:18:00.600
it's not download content... It's the biggest version of Pay to Unlock ever. Seriously.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.600
Well, the question is then, if that's the case, then I wonder if it's a save file or

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:09.600
something like that. Who knows? But the other thing to consider, there's a trailer for The

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.600
Force Unleashed in the game. And I'm sure that's part of how they were able to negotiate

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.600
Starkiller and Yoda being in the game. But just very interesting. It kind of makes you

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:23.600
think, ah, maybe there's... I see what you did there. I would bet 10 to 1 that's going

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.600
to be the way you unlock it is that you have to get Force Unleashed, which means it'll

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:33.600
be impossible to find on Gamefly. And I wonder if having the fact that you have Soul Calibur

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.600
IV if that unlocks something for you on The Force Unleashed. Perhaps. Maybe an alternate

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.600
costume for Starkiller since he does have two in Soul Calibur. Who knows? Might be a

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.600
little silly, but you never know. The unlocks aren't always that great. They should just

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.600
chain them and they'll have something else and then you'll unlock... Just time release,

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.600
Vader. You know, like three months from now, just time release them. Do a patch that unlocks

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.600
them. It's obvious something's going to go there. There's one square in the game that

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.600
is not filled in. And if you look on the PlayStation... That goes for nobody. It's very obvious.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.600
That's like, you know, one for me and one for my homies. They looped like six characters

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:18.600
in one screen. The star screen. Not to be confused with Starkiller. They had famous

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.600
anime creators make Soul Calibur characters, but they're just all filed under the star

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.600
icon in the select menu. And some of them are pretty cool, actually. But anyhow, sorry.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:35.600
Getting off topic. That's interesting, though. Good theory. Something completely unrelated

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:43.600
to Star Wars. The shit game, as I mentioned during my gaming week. It's a game that looks

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:49.600
like shit. Literally. It basically looks like the whole game was made out of MS Paint, and

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.600
it very well may have. But the whole reason, I guess, is it's supposed to be like all the

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.600
shovelware games that you play out there. Just the absolute worst of the worst. But

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:03.600
it is a pretty fun game, and it's just really strange looking. It's all black and white.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:08.600
Really strange stuff in there, from a level with crashing planes to a giant foot like

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:18.600
Monty Python. Floating eyeballs. Awesome. Fire. All sorts of crazy stuff. And basically

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:23.600
the game, I mean, it's very short, but it challenges you to try to beat it, losing the

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.600
least amount of lives and getting through it quickly. And there are a lot of quick ways

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:33.600
you can kind of glitch through the game and beat it a lot faster. So it is worth a download

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:40.600
if you're looking to check it out. Go to Doomlaser.com, and there's an article there called

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:45.600
a game by any other name would still be shit. I would actually like to see a game where

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:56.600
a giant foot comes down and squashes your character and then suddenly... Yes. I knew

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:03.600
this was coming. Oh, and the best part about the game, I forgot to mention, is that all

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:11.600
the music in it is MIDI. And it's all like, you know, like pop music MIDI. Like they have

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:17.600
Spice Girls in there, and it's all randomly selected too. Like Lenny Kravitz and Spice

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.600
Girls and stuff. I think that from here on out, all the rest of Loki's stories should

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:33.600
be done to Monty Python's Flying Circus opening. Okay, we can arrange that. Okay. We'll see

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.600
how that works, we'll try. Now here's the thing though, wouldn't this be Shit Game 2?

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:43.600
Because I've played Ping Pals. Well, Shit Game 3, because I've also played Yaris. Oh,

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:48.600
I see. But see, that's the thing, is this game's actually better. But seriously though,

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:53.600
the character looks like he's made from MS Paint, and I think he was. He looked all...

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.600
It was hilarious, I watched the video of it. I did download the game before the show. Haven't

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:04.600
played it yet, but I'm gonna give it a try. Is it maybe a minimalist thing? Like irony

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:09.600
through minimalism? It's special. It is a very special game. You know, when we start

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:13.600
putting naughty words into the names of video games, it makes us want to use other naughty

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.600
words here on the program. We have one very naughty segment we do every week here on Orange

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:39.600
Radio. You know what it's called? The FUs of the Week. My FU of the Week, it first of

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:47.600
all goes towards my cat and her passengers. I have had to bathe the cat today. She has

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:55.600
bad fleas, and they did not all wash off, so I have to get ahold of Heather, you know,

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.600
I have to get ahold of Heather and get some front lines for my kitty cat. Well, I know

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:02.600
Heather, but the listeners don't know Heather. Heather's awesome! Okay, that's all you need

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:09.600
to know. That's all you need to know. But I have to get her treated and so she stops

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:14.600
going bald out from her allergies and I don't know because I've been treating her for the

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:20.600
last three months and nothing has helped her, so I'm just, I hate them. I hate the little

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:27.600
squirmy things on my baby cat. Death to fleas. All of them! Except for Red Hot Chili Peppers.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:35.600
Because that flea is awesome. Okay. That flea may survive the flea holocaust. Yes. Alright.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:39.600
Lowkey, your FUs of the Week. A few people driving around, still talking on their cell

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:45.600
phones without their Bluetooth headsets. Amen! I followed some chick today because... The

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:50.600
speakerphone's okay, right? The speakerphone's fine. If you have a hands-free phone, I am

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.600
fine with that because that's following the law and you shouldn't be as much of a nuisance

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:59.600
on the road. But there's still these fucking people and they're idiots, they're talking

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.600
around, you know, with their cell phones and just driving fucking slow and just really

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:09.600
annoying. In fact, this woman actually, she drove through the parking lot really slow

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:13.600
and then, oh, my other favorite thing is when there's a slight dip in the road or something

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:19.600
like that and people slow the fuck down. Well, they're in an SUV, an off-roading vehicle

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:24.600
and they slow the fuck down because it's a little dip in the road. Oh my god. That's

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:28.600
also annoying. Just a point, though. Somebody talking on the cell phone in their parking

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:33.600
lot wouldn't technically be illegal. They're still driving. I know, but it's technically

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.600
they can't pull you over in the parking lot. Well, she's still driving around, so that

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:42.600
still counts. Just a technicality. I'm just saying. And I followed her there, but she's

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.600
a dumb bitch and I actually thought about knocking on her window and going, get off

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:51.600
the fucking phone, ass. But no, I had better things to do. Alright, is that it? That's

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:56.600
it. Alright. F you to clothes shopping. I went clothes shopping yesterday. Actually,

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.600
shopping for clothes is fun. It's grown a meal. I used to hate it when I was younger,

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:04.600
but now I love shopping for clothes. The only thing I don't like is paying for them. And

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:08.600
I'm not advocating theft of clothes, but I went to Mervyn's this week because I heard

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:12.600
they were filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy and I want to make sure I get all the good sales

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:17.600
before the chain goes under. And also, thanks to me being sick earlier this year and the

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:22.600
diet that has resulted, I've lost another waist size. So I had to buy all new jeans,

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:30.600
and that's expensive. Clothes are expensive. So F you to expensive clothes. But a non-F

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.600
you to Mervyn's and a non-F you to Mervyn's sales, because those are both awesome. I still

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.600
need to go to the outlets though this week, because the outlets are the best thing ever.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.600
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news. I will bring it back with Mega Man 9 news.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.600
It seems like every week there's something new about Mega Man 9. People loving the retro,

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.600
you know, coming back to this. Here's the neat thing is that Capcom has said this week

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.600
that the WiiWare version of Mega Man 9, it will have different control options. You can

01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.600
turn the Wii mode on its side to play the game. You can also use the classic controller.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.600
Anything that will go into the GameCube port you can also use to play. So if you think

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:11.600
about it, you could go all the way back to the Wii NES Retro port. You know, this is

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:17.600
a device that was released that allows you to, yes, plug in your old school NES controller

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.600
and play Mega Man 9 the way it might have been meant to be played with the old school

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:27.600
NES controller. What do you guys think? Is this worth going through the hassle just to

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.600
play with the old school NES controller? Or, forget it, just use the Wii mode. I think

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.600
that sounds like fun. It does not. It sounds like a challenge. And who doesn't love a

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.600
challenge? It sounds like another excuse for G4 to bring out their giant NES controller

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:47.600
to do something stupid on TV. Yippee! Can't wait. Out of curiosity, would this sway you

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.600
to buy this on the Wii, or are you still like, eh, not good enough, I'm still going to get

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.600
it on 360? That's right. That's kind of where I'm at. I'm like, oh that's cute. Well actually,

01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:05.600
actually. Cute, but. I may still get it on the Wii. But. I'm still on my silly boycott.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.600
I have no room. And that's where I stand. I have no room for games. Don't worry, don't

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:14.600
worry Rob. We won't have to purchase it. I will get it on the 360 I'm sure. But I like,

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.600
I like the prospect of being able to use the old controller. Why don't they put it on the

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.600
DS? They need to put like another Mega Man collection on the DS and release this along

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:27.600
with it. Do you think Capcom might release a remake of the game later on? I mean, they've

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.600
never done that before. Never ever, right? Do you think there might be a Mega Man 9 Championship

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:39.600
Turbo Edition next year? I doubt it. You never know. You never know. Well, moving forward.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:46.600
And forward is a good way to move. Konami wants to hop on the, the old school bandwagon.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.600
Because, well everyone else is doing it, why can't they? Well, then again, they were already

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.600
doing the Castlevania one, right? Rumored. But, yeah, well here's more rumor. It was

01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:06.600
actually in EGM, put up by Wii Fanboy, said that in the September 2008 issue, that there

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:12.600
will be one of the most beloved yet overlooked action-adventure franchises of yore will soon

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:22.600
get a surprise retro-revival sequel. Hmm. It better not be Bomberman. Still a Bomberman,

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:31.600
but we've already had Bomberman. Go Emon! It'll be, um, um, um, what if it was Turtles

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.600
Tournament Fighter? That would be awesome. They lost the Turtles license to EA. That's

01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:44.600
right, damn. Or it could be, um, no they lost it, they could be soft. Or it could be, um,

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:52.600
Rocky O'Hare! Gradius, since they already said they were gonna do a Gradius a couple

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:58.600
of weeks ago. Yeah. Who knows. How about a bunch of stuff? How about Blades of Steel?

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.600
I'm gonna pretend you just didn't see that. Do not roll your eyes at me, young lady. I

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:07.600
love Blades of Steel. That was the first NES hockey game where you could actually fight.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.600
Like, not crappy like ice hockey. I'm talking about punching people in the face. That's

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:17.600
great. And why else should there be hockey in the world? For blood, because blood bounces

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:23.600
on ice. AgDef suggests double dribble. How about Skate or Die? Was that a Konami game?

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.600
I don't think it was. I think, actually. No, Ultra, it was Ultra games. Yeah, yeah. So

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:34.600
that was Skate or Die, hey. Hmm, maybe. We'll see. I don't think they would do that game.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:40.600
A man can dream. I know. Yeah, that's all, unfortunately, it will ever become. Um, but

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:46.600
here's some games that will be coming at some point, but they have been rated by the ESRB.

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:52.600
Man, you know that ESRB, they still can't quite lock down those games from being announced.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:58.600
Mega Man 1 and 2 have been spotted on there, as well as Earthworm Jim 2, so that's pretty

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:05.600
cool. Earthworm Jim. Remember the opening to Earthworm Jim? I love that. Some other things,

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:13.600
um, Ys Book 1 and 2 will be coming out, and Samurai Showdown 2. Yes, that was the best

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:22.600
one. Wasn't Ys a CD game? Or am I wrong? I would like to say that Ys Book 1 and 2 came

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:30.600
out on CD, so the two games were released as a single CD. Have we gotten CD games here

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:35.600
yet? Yeah. We have? Oh. They got Dracula X in Japan, didn't they? Yeah, I knew they were

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:40.600
coming, I just didn't know we had any yet. That's awesome. But no, the Ys games are good,

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:46.600
now I won't. Yeah, I might actually, ugh, I don't have room for Ys. You know what, Rob,

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:52.600
I'll tell you what, just come over to my house, we'll hook up the PC Engine. Deal! Anything

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:58.600
else, Loki, coming out? That's it. Alright, I thought there might be more. Well, two games

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:02.600
coming out very soon that people are very much looking forward to. StarCraft II and

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:08.600
Diablo III. Now, you might have heard in last episode or elsewhere around the internet that

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:12.600
Wrath of the Lich King, the new Warcraft expansion, is going to be getting an achievement system

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:17.600
in the game. Um, achievements for, you know, exploring every zone in the game or completing

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.600
certain quests or beating certain instances or what have you. Well, here's the kind of

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:24.600
interesting thing. Blizzard is creating somewhat of an achievement system of their own because

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:30.600
guess what, StarCraft II and Diablo III, yep, they're going to have achievements as well.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:37.600
Every achievement earned is going to go towards this Blizzard level that every Blizzard user

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:41.600
is going to use. You could basically think of it like an Xbox Live type thing where you

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:46.600
have a gamer score, but now you're going to have a Blizzard level. Definitely a way to

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.600
kind of tie in all the Blizzard universes together. Because you know there's going to

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.600
be plenty of people playing all three. I'm not as huge on StarCraft, I might still check

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:58.600
it out. Plus, William loves StarCraft. I don't know if you know that. He's not that big of

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:03.600
a gamer, but he loves StarCraft. So he is all excited about StarCraft II. So he'll probably

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.600
make me buy that for him. And then Diablo III I'm excited about because I did like Diablo

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:15.600
II quite a bit. Achievement Whore Loki, are you excited? Eh. But you don't really play

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:21.600
Blizzard games on the computer, do you? No, I used to. I used to play like, um, what was

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:26.600
it? I used to play StarCraft, or not StarCraft, World of Warcraft, not World of Warcraft,

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:32.600
Warcraft! The original Warcraft and Diablo. Never played Diablo II though. Should have.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:37.600
It's interesting. I was just looking at a chat room here. Pooface says, too bad the

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:41.600
life of a Blizzard game lasts the same of a game console. I don't know, it seems like

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:45.600
Blizzard games last a long time. There's still people that frickin' play Diablo II like it

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.600
just came out yesterday. Lieutenant Pliskin says, achievements are all the rage these

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:55.600
days. Yeah, kinda. You see trophies now, and pretty soon I'm sure Nintendo will have something

01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:03.600
as well, who knows. Well, something else that is pretty, this makes me very, very, very

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:13.600
happy. There is a rumor now that Sega is going to be bringing back the Jet Set Radio games.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:18.600
As we know, there was a Dreamcast one, which we actually got as Jet Grind Radio, and then

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:25.600
Xbox had Jet Set Radio Future, and then there was a Jet Set Radio for the Game Boy Advance.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:33.600
So, there is definite speculation that Sega is going to be bringing this out, but I'll

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:42.600
tell you what's an interesting thing that actually supports this rumor, is that Sega

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:51.600
did file a trademark on July 24th, this year, that's separate from their original filing

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:58.600
for the Jet Set Radio license. Well, I think Jet Set Radio on the Wii would be a pretty

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.600
cool thing, don't you? Can you imagine, of course you can do graffiti with the Wii logo.

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:08.600
What if we had it on the iPhone? Too tiny, too tiny. Well, they've been quoted as saying,

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:16.600
well, the president of Sega is quoted as saying that the iPhone is the new Dreamcast. Interesting.

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:20.600
Could you imagine doing your graffiti with your finger? That would be kind of weird to

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.600
me, I don't know. And fun. Yeah, maybe for a little while, but I don't know. I do hope

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:31.600
the rumor is true, though. I don't know if I'd be calling the iPhone the new Dreamcast,

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:36.600
that's not a good thing to compare it to. Well, do you have some more news for us, Loki?

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:46.600
Yeah. Well, this kind of goes back to the whole story about achievements. With all these

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.600
different systems coming out with their own achievement and trophy and, you know, whatever

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.600
systems, there's actually going to be a new site to track all these at the same time.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:01.600
It's actually being created by Rooster Teeth, who you may remember from the Red vs. Blue

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:07.600
series, among all their other animated machima series. But now they have a brand new website

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:15.600
that's going to database all these, and that site is, what's it called? Small Rewards.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.600
Achievement Hunter, I'm sorry. That's what it's called. And right now I know that they

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:27.600
were saying that they're going to do the 360, the PS3, and of course the iPhone, and maybe

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:33.600
of course they're going to add on these Blizzard ones as well. So, that's pretty cool. They'll

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.600
have to track all these different sites. I wonder if they're going to have some sort

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:43.600
of way to add them all together or something like that. Is that really necessary?

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.600
Yes, it's very necessary.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:46.600
Actually, it is kind of funny. I don't know why.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.600
It is. I think it's hilarious.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:54.600
Darktitsuya says, I'm liking the theme music for stories. You know, I once listened to

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.600
a gaming podcast, I don't remember who it was, but they actually play music in the background

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.600
the entire show, which is cool because I think they play mostly indie bands and stuff, and

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:08.600
you know, it makes their show unique, so more power to them, but just kind of funny. I never

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:13.600
thought of doing theme music for stories. I think it would be cool if we could actually,

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:17.600
when we're talking about a certain game, have the music from the game playing in the background,

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:22.600
but that takes a lot of coordinated effort, you guys don't even know. I would do it if

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:28.600
we could, but in the meantime, you get Monty Python's Flying Circus.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:35.600
I don't know what theme music would be appropriate for this. Maybe something about moving on

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:39.600
or something. Wasn't that a DDR song moving on? Penny Arcade Expo is going to the East

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.600
Coast in 2010. That is the current rumor going around. Actually, it's not really a rumor.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:49.600
Tycho himself has said that Penny Arcade Expo is going to be going to the East Coast, and

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.600
that doesn't mean that the West Coast show is going to go anywhere. They're turning packs

01:36:53.600 --> 01:37:01.600
into multiple places at multiple times type events. Apparently, it's quoted by, the Penny

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.600
Arcade team has been quoted from saying, frankly, it should be global. An East Coast show is

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:10.600
only the beginning. So one thing they might announce at Penny Arcade Expo this year is

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.600
that there's going to be probably an East Coast show next year, and who knows, maybe

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:24.600
something in Europe? Canada? Who knows? Somewhere maybe outside the US. Hawaii? Australia?

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:30.600
Penny Arcade Expo, Luxembourg. Yes. Penny Arcade, Mozambique. Wouldn't that be fun?

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:39.600
Monaco. To Las Vegas or Monaco, win a fortune in the game. My life would never be the same.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.600
Rob. Ah yes, let's uh. Let's get this part over with.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:50.600
Yes, it's the mailbag, kids. Every week you email us. Mailbag at orangelauncherator.com.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:54.600
Let's open up the mailbag, see what you guys have to say this week.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:01.600
Oh, did we ever get some doozies? I got to say doozy. Well first of all, this comes from

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:10.600
Dave. Hi Dave! Hi Dave. You can't do that, Dave. Sorry. Hey OLR crew, great work on the

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.600
show. I was wondering if any of you have checked out giantbomb.com, the new website from former

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:21.600
game spotter Jeff Gertsman and company. It's basically a potentially awesome game focused

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.600
wiki. What do you think of it if you've tried it? I'm sure there are tons of randomly awesome

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:32.600
games on Sega systems in its desperate need of Dark Sakura's careful attention. Love the

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:37.600
show and other nice closing pleasantries. Forgive the shit punctuation. Oh, you're forgiven.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:43.600
Dave from Yeild, England. You're forgiven. Chat room, I'm not stupid. When I said Hawaii

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:49.600
being outside the US, I meant continental US, of course. I'm not dumb. Anyhow, sorry,

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:57.600
email is giantbomb.com. Yes, I actually did visit it and it's sleek. But here's the thing,

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:03.600
if I want game wiki, I usually go to Wikipedia. I'm not exactly sure what is going to make

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.600
me visit this site on a daily basis, which is what it's all about, right? That's just

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:12.600
some friendly feedback. I'm not trying to knock the site or anything because it's rather

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.600
slick. It's put together rather well and I think they'll get a lot of listeners and certainly

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:20.600
they have some knowledgeable people from the gaming industry working for it, but I'm not

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.600
sure there's anything there just yet that's going to make me want to click reload every

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:27.600
six hours. You know what I mean? But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, okay.

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.600
But there's a lot of neat information on it. Like there's bios that are pretty well written

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.600
for most big people in the game industry and then it ties into the games that they've done.

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:40.600
Um, so if I were looking for specific information that place to go, you know, it does have some

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:44.600
advantages over Wikipedia. I'll give it that. It's not, it's not a bad site by any means

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:53.600
and it's different. It's something different. So props to them. Next. Yes. Our weekly letter

01:39:53.600 --> 01:40:00.600
from cheeseburger. You know, you don't have to read every single email. Yes, I do. All

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.600
right. No, mostly. All right. Hey guys, today I got a subscription to Xbox live with a headset

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.600
camera and some other stuff including two arcade games. I only have halo three and no

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:14.600
arcade games. So what arcade games do you think I should get? I don't like sports and

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:19.600
have things like Pac-Man be Jordan Zuma on my iPod. Well, if you were listening to part

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.600
a, I would tell you to go right now and get geometry wars retro evolve too, because I

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.600
think it's probably the best game on Xbox live arcade right now. There's symphony of

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:32.600
the night. Which is also a great game. Get it. If you don't have a PS1. Get it. Also

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:35.600
good games. If you like music games, which a lot of our audience does, I don't know where

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:41.600
you stand on that. Not UNO, but Every Extent Extra Extreme, maybe Luminous as well, would

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:47.600
both be good things to look into. Luminous is sweet. If you like music games. If you're

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:50.600
not so much on music games, if you like role playing games, a penny arcade game is actually

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:55.600
pretty low worthy, although it is a little more pricier. But stay away from some of those

01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:02.600
retro classic change games. I do like the Pac-Man though, tournament edition. Oh god,

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:08.600
yes, thank you chat. Run, do not walk, rez HD. Yeah. Which could also very well be the

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:14.600
best game on Xbox live arcade. It is a virtual tie with Geometry Wars 2. They are both great.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:19.600
So run, do not walk, rez and Geometry Wars. Pac-Man Championship Edition, honestly. Whether

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:23.600
you have the original on your iPhone or not, the act-def, I completely agree with that

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.600
act-def just saying in chat. It doesn't matter if you already have the original version,

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:30.600
it's different enough. The only thing better than that though was the GameCube Pac-Man

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:36.600
versus. But you don't get that on Xbox Live, so make do. So next up, Hello Sky, DarkSakura

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.600
and Loki. Hello emailer. First things first, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy listening

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:45.600
to your show. Not all gaming podcasts are created equal, and yours is a testament to

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:50.600
that. Thank you. That doesn't necessarily mean we're above the rest, the way that's

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:55.600
working. Oh yes we are, hush. So, moving forward, I just wanted to chime in with my opinion

01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:00.600
on Nintendo and this year's E3. As far as I am concerned, the lukewarm reception Nintendo

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:04.600
received was entirely deserving. DarkSakura correctly pointed out that they are a business

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:09.600
and their primary concern is making money, but I fear that their current hard-on for

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:15.600
casual gamer is going to come back and bite them in the ass. The casual market is supporting

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:19.600
them, but it will not sustain them. The Wii has the lowest attach rate of all the current

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:24.600
gen consoles. The fact remains that it is still the hardcore gamers who are the lifeblood

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.600
of the gaming companies. Nintendo has the most loyal fanbase of any of the big three,

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:33.600
but if these hardcore fans are made to feel more and more alienated, not all of the Mario

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.600
and Zelda sequels in the world will keep them from defecting to another camp that can offer

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:42.600
them more. And by more, I mean hassle-free online and disk-based storage. As someone

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.600
who grew up with an NES controller in my hands disappoints me to see Nintendo apparently

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:51.600
dropping me for kindergarteners and soccer moms, and I now know I am not alone in this.

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.600
Loki will back me up, I'm sure. Keep on rocking like the proverbial hurricane, raw fish and

01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:01.600
beer. This email is brought to you by Mixed Metaphors, home of the ass-biting hard-ons.

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:07.600
Really? That's the best home of thing ever.

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.600
Uh, the beat goes on when Nintendo. Beat goes on.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:16.600
Next up. Hey, O-L-R. Hi. I know Rob is a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and I wanted

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.600
to know what his reaction was to the news of MTV creating a remake of the classic film.

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:29.600
If he didn't know yet, I'm sorry to be the bearer of what I see as terrible news. Harry.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:38.600
Um, yeah, it's, uh, it's, you know, I don't like to judge things until I see them or watch

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:44.600
them or play them or whatever, but in this case, you just kinda know. This has, you know,

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:51.600
remember the old Animaniacs segment? Good idea, bad idea? Bad idea, this right here.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:58.600
Okay, this is my thought, though. Okay, we saw the redone play, right? Yes. And that

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:09.600
was good. Yeah. What if they had it carry, I guess, the updated music of the new play,

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:13.600
but keep the feel of the old one? Again, I don't want to judge it until I've seen it.

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.600
A casting choice is very important as, you know, a lot of it that goes into it, and I

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:21.600
don't want to say that everything MTV touches necessarily turns to shit, because, you know,

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:26.600
rock band's cool, but then again, this is the network that brought us the hills. I mean,

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:33.600
shit, enough said, right? This is the network that started reality TV. I think this is kind

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:40.600
of unnecessary, but it's also inevitable at the same time. If it ain't broke, don't remake

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:44.600
it. I liked the idea better five years ago when the rumor was that the guy who did Priscilla

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:48.600
Queen of the Desert was going to be remaking it with Alan Cumming playing Frank-N-Furter.

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:52.600
Oh my god, wouldn't that be great? See, I was totally fine with that. That would just

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:57.600
be... Now we're five years later, and the rumor's a little less cool. So, we'll see.

01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:05.600
SSG100Matt says, OLR needs a Wheel of Morality segment. We do! Wheel of Morality, turn, turn,

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:13.600
turn, show us the lesson that we should learn. Love it. Okay, email! Dun dun dun. Yo, OLR,

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:21.600
this be the GS68. Um, yo, dude. Okay. Okay, enough of the speaking in GhettoSpeak. In response

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:25.600
to Akdeft's call last week, how people who play Rock Band should learn real instruments.

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.600
I'd like to say that. Ooh, this is bulleted, too. I'm impressed. People who play One Gun

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:35.600
or Initial D should invest shitloads of money in a real car and then illegally street race

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.600
down Highway 101 at 200 miles an hour. People who play Pokeman should capture real animals

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:45.600
and train them. Hi, PETA. Well, that's okay. PETA's a bunch of psycho assholes, anyway.

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:50.600
People who play GTA should learn to hijack cars and kill people in real life. Hi, um,

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:56.600
he who shall not be named. People who play Mulana should explore real life ruins and

01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:00.600
get killed in the process. People who play Shoot Em Up should invest in a real space

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:06.600
fighter jet. Oh, wait, those don't exist. That is all, GS68. PS, this email is brought

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:13.600
to you by Tekken, home of the never-ending stages. DJ Ratchet makes a good point going

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:18.600
back to the hills. The hills makes the soup funny. That is true. Without MTV, the soup

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.600
would not be nearly as funny. Oh, yes, to that other email. There's more email. Okay,

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:28.600
more email. Um, actually, Robwith2B sent us a couple of stories. Yay! And this one, I

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:38.600
think, is hilarious. It's the top seven irritating female characters in video games. So, if the

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:45.600
stupid ad would ever disappear, because I fucking hate ads. Oh, you know what, I'm about

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:53.600
to just say, screw this, because I hate ads. Stop. Someone's gotta pay the bills. Number

01:46:53.600 --> 01:47:03.600
seven is Ashley Williams from Mass Effect. Um, I don't know, I didn't play Mass Effect.

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:10.600
Six is Minnie Mouse. I guess I'm talking about the- Mickey Mousecapade was awesome. Yeah,

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:20.600
Mickey Mousecapade. Screw whoever wrote that. Ashley Graham from Resident Evil 4. Um, moving

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:35.600
forward. God, the internet sucks. Sorry. Four is, um, Mikiko Ebihara from Daikatana. And

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:51.600
then, um, stupid webpage. Next up is, um, it looks like Catalina from Grand Theft Auto

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:59.600
3. And then the Beggar Lady in Assassin's Creed. And then, um, our last one's on the

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:08.600
list. Number one is Navi from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Hey, listen. Hey, listen.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:17.600
Hey, listen. Hey, listen. So, uh. Hey, Yuna was not annoying. That was my roommate contributing

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:26.600
there, Yuna. That was awful, she needed to die. No. Wow, I think, that's like the first

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.600
time I think my roommate's kind of gotten into the video game discussion here on the

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:33.600
program. Usually, usually he turns his nose up at the show. He's cooking something that

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.600
smells delightful right outside the door, though. Yeah, what's funny is we have the

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:41.600
tornado bringing out, that's how we finally fixed our air conditioning problem. We bought

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:45.600
a tornado to suck in air conditioning from the house and blow it out here. But tonight,

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:51.600
since the roommate is cooking, it sucks and it blows. His very delightful dish is, uh,

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:56.600
we can smell nothing but that out here because it's sucking air from the kitchen. Anyway,

01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:04.600
sorry. So, um, another one from Rob, um, I haven't really read the article, but he said,

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:09.600
um, I got this link in GamePolitics.com, a judge disenfranchises the class in class action

01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:14.600
suit. And, um, it's about the Grand Theft Auto, um, thing. I'll link it in the chat

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:19.600
room. Um, it says, I'm actually a little surprised since the original suit was not over state

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:25.600
laws, but just about getting more than he paid for. I'd rather be broke, be broken by

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.600
providing, by proving the class didn't actually exist. So I'd rather it be broken by proving

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.600
the class didn't actually exist. I also retract my E3 2008 as boring comment. If you really

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:40.600
dig into the third-party games and the, uh, non-big announcements, there are a lot of

01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:45.600
good information. My original opinion was based, um, all on the A-list games news being

01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:51.600
leaked to the interwebs. So it was, uh, spoiled for me. Level up, you now have three character

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:56.600
points to apply towards your stats, Rob. With two Bs. And I'm just looking at this article

01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:03.600
real quick. Can I put three points in Awesomeness? Hmm. Okay. Um, it said that the settlement

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:10.600
over the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, um, uh, settlement was actually hitting a snag

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:16.600
because they're saying on there that the, those who were to benefit from the, uh, that,

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:22.600
that class that they're referring to actually isn't there. So, because not everybody knew

01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:26.600
about it until something came out on the internet. But I'll link this in the chat room. It's

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:32.600
an interesting little article. It's, um, for anyone who's interested, just go to, um, it's

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:37.600
actually on the, uh, New York Times blog is, uh, where I linked it to me in the technology

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:43.600
section. Just look up, um, settlement over sex scenes in Grand Theft Auto hits a snag.

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:49.600
I'll link it in the chat room. That's it. All right. If you want to email us, mailbag

01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:56.600
at orangelaungeradio.com. All right. It's dot com. We have a couple more news articles

01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.600
for you guys, and then we're going to be opening up the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR, username

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:06.600
on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Yeah, it's not just coincidence. Well, um, it's only

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:11.600
fair since Rock Band's getting really awesome peripherals from a third-party company that

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:17.600
Guitar Hero World Tour will get awesome peripherals from a third-party company. The third-party

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:23.600
company providing these would be Logitech, and of course they already make the USB microphones

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:29.600
that are used by almost, I'd say, almost all of the music games out there right now. And

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:36.600
they're going to be doing some high-end guitars and drum sets as well. No word exactly what

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:41.600
features these will have, but, you know, if it's Logitech, you can probably guess it's

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:47.600
going to be put together at least pretty well. So, um, yeah. I guess we'll just have to

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:56.600
wait and see when they show these off. Uh, yay, more peripherals to put on the Best Buy

01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:00.600
shelves and other gaming stores to take up space. Well, these things are damn expensive.

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:07.600
I mean, if it's anything like that $399 drum set, which I do still want, I don't know why

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:12.600
because I don't play Rock Band, but I want it anyways. Speaking of music games, I've

01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:16.600
been kind of brainstorming how I would make a game like Beatmania 2DX work, and I've thought

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:21.600
about, like, a game that would combine Beatmania 2DX and Popin' Music. I think it would be

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:28.600
actually kind of cool. I just wish I had a game company to make it for me. Moving on,

01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:32.600
not that anyone cares, but Jamie's going to care about this one. This is a news article

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:38.600
just for you, Dark Sakura. Yes, it's about Ragnarok Online. Not just that, but Ragnarok

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:44.600
Online DS. Now, here's the thing. This was announced quite some time ago, and now we're

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:48.600
starting to wonder, is this game ever going to come out? Well, here's the thing. Ragnarok

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:52.600
Online on the DS, it's not actually going to be an MMO. You don't get to play it with

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:55.600
other people. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be. Right, and that kind of makes sense, but

01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:00.600
it is going to be a single-player role-playing game that apparently has some online features

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:06.600
in it, whatever that means. Some screenshots have come out for the game this week as well,

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:09.600
and it does have that same chibi style that you've come to know and love from the original

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:14.600
Ragnarok Online. I looked at the pictures and I saw a bunny band. Apparently you do

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:18.600
have gestural attack inputs. You use the stylus to kind of draw your attacks and things like

01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:24.600
that. December 18th is the day this comes out overseas. Import! Yep, I bet you will.

01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.600
You know I will. I know you will. Whether or not I can read most of it or not. You know

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:33.600
what I know will happen right now is that we are going to open up the Skype line at

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:38.600
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and we're going to take a few calls

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:42.600
here on this Part B of our show tonight. We actually kind of jammed through the stories

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:46.600
part of our show tonight. It's only about 815 on the West Coast. That's not bad! Because

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:50.600
here we've got a 10 minute late start tonight. Oh, I thought you said on the East Coast,

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:54.600
I'm like, wait, what? No, no, no, 815 here, but usually we don't get to the Skype line

01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:59.600
until like 9 o'clock, so we're doing good tonight. 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype,

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:02.600
Orange Lounge Radio, it's not ringing right now, so Loki, do you have any last minute,

01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:06.600
or I should start with Dark Soccer, do you have any last minute stories for us? Um, no,

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:13.600
not really. Uh, Loki? Um, I haven't really been looking at last minute stories. Oh, here's

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:20.600
some, yay. Um, Sony's Life, you may remember that, um, as the, their version of the globe

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:27.600
spinning news thing, so that's not coming out right away. It's been delayed. Wow, surprise.

01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:34.600
Sony delaying something? Yeah. Anyways. Rock Band, download content. We've got some stuff

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:39.600
coming out this week, including, uh, Crewfest Pack 2, and we're going to be getting with

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:45.600
that, uh, Face Down in the Dirt by Motley Crue for 80 points or a dollar. Um, Rescue

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:52.600
Me by Buck Cherry, another 80 points or a dollar, and Life is Beautiful by 6 AM, and

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:57.600
that's also 80 points or a dollar, whole pack for 240 or 3 bucks. And then each, um, they're

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:02.600
going to have individual songs for BYOB from System of a Down for 2 bucks, and Toxicity

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:07.600
from System of a Down, also 2 bucks, and you might remember those were part of the System

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:13.600
of a Down exclusive download content for when you, um, bought their album, so that's kind

01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:21.600
of interesting. And, um, you remember there's a game coming out called Last Guy on the PlayStation

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:25.600
Network, and what's interesting about this game is it's actually very similar to a game

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.600
that came out on WTF, the PSP game. Well, they have a website where you can play it

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:35.600
on any URL, which is kind of cool, and of course it's lastguy.jp, go there and you can...

01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:36.600
Does it work on our own website?

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:37.600
It'll work on any website.

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.600
Would it be fun on our website?

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:40.600
Um...

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:41.600
Let's check it out.

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.600
Yeah, lastguy.jp.

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.600
Alright.

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:47.600
And, uh...

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:51.600
Skypline's open and no one's calling, that's weird. I just checked it to make sure it works.

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.600
I called 1877 Game OLR. Well, it happens sometimes.

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:55.600
Yeah, because I was...

01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:56.600
I was supposed to just quiet.

01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:00.600
I was supposed to be looking up, um, you know, stories, but I was working on trying to get

01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.600
the Wiimotes to work with that Love is Blind game, you know, the one that makes the sex

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:06.600
noises, but, uh...

01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:11.600
Apparently my Bluetooth adapter says, fuck you, Wiimote, I ain't working with you, bitch.

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:12.600
And so...

01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:15.600
Aw, so now we get to play the chat, uh, the sex game?

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.600
No, we can, we can. They have a keyboard version too, so...

01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:19.600
Oh, well, hooray.

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:21.600
It's just not quite, you know, as...

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:22.600
That's a little bonus thing after the show, right?

01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:23.600
Yes.

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:24.600
Okay, that sounds good.

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:29.600
I found, by accident, I found a funny MMO that's, um, all about, uh, getting laid.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:31.600
And partying.

01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:32.600
Right.

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:35.600
It's like some sort of social networking thing, but I thought it was hilarious.

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:37.600
It was called Red Light Center.

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:39.600
I just thought it was funny.

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:42.600
I don't think I'm going to play it, but I think it was funny.

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.600
Yeah, so, um...

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.600
Yeah, that's pretty much...

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.600
The only other story I had was Ubisoft's localizing Armored Core 4 answer for the US,

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:54.600
and it should be coming out in September.

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.600
And that's kind of cool, I guess.

01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:59.600
Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by Armored Core 4.

01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:01.600
I don't know if I'll pick this up.

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:02.600
Probably not.

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:04.600
But...

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:05.600
I don't know.

01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.600
Can't get too excited anymore.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:07.600
I used to love Armored Core games.

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:10.600
I used to buy every single one that came out, but...

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:11.600
Oh, well.

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:15.600
Oh, I guess I did miss a game that was supposed to be coming out on the Wii and DS this week.

01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:18.600
Little League World Series 2008.

01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:19.600
I know. Sad.

01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:21.600
Oh, and this week on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:24.600
We've got Braid for, like, 15 bucks.

01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:25.600
Is that game supposed to be cool?

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:26.600
It looks kind of neat from the previews.

01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.600
It's supposed to be pretty cool.

01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:28.600
You can kind of, like, it's...

01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:32.600
Imagine, like, a 2D platform game with the sands of time built into it.

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.600
All right.

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.600
Finally, our phone's ringing.

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.600
Who's this?

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:39.600
It's a dead, tired Rama.

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:40.600
Hey, Rama.

01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:44.600
You know, and I'm kind of glad somebody called, even if, you know, you call us quite often.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:46.600
Are you looking at Justin.tv, by the way?

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:52.600
Actually, I'm not because I just got off the bus ride from hell about 40 minutes ago.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:56.600
I'm wearing your shirt that you got when you were out here in California, the one you bought.

01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:58.600
Give me a second.

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:00.600
Let me fire it up and see what you got over there.

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:01.600
Well, no rush.

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:03.600
I'll still be here after we hang up.

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:04.600
What's on your mind?

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:07.600
You went to a con because you've been sending me pictures.

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.600
Yeah, did you like the pictures I sent?

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.600
Yes, they're really hard to see on my phone.

01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:15.600
I liked them because you sent me Knights or Riala, one of them.

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:16.600
I think I sent you both.

01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.600
I got a Frank-N-Furter one.

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.600
I know.

01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:22.600
I see Scott.

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:23.600
I also got a Bubble Bobble.

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:24.600
Heart.

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:25.600
There you go.

01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:26.600
Heart.

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:27.600
Right, I heart and why.

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.600
There you have it.

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.600
All right, so how was the con?

01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:32.600
What con was it you went to?

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:33.600
It was called what?

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:34.600
Kinetic Con.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:35.600
Kinetic Con.

01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:37.600
How was that?

01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:40.600
Much better than I thought it was.

01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:45.600
It gave me a Fonami feel to it, so you know what that means, I'll be going back to that convention next year.

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:47.600
Fonami is a good time.

01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:52.600
Fonami is a great con.

01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:58.600
I got there late Friday night because I had to work and I missed my bus, but I got there Saturday.

01:58:58.600 --> 01:58:59.600
I left my camera.

01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:01.600
It showed up an hour later.

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:06.600
It wasn't as packed, but it was just really roomy, really flowing.

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:10.600
And then when I got to the room, my roommate tells me, oh, there's going to be furries here.

01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.600
What?

01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:15.600
That was exactly my reaction.

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:20.600
Correct me if I'm wrong, Rama, but did you not say that you missed the bus?

01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:22.600
Yeah, getting Friday I missed the bus.

01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:27.600
I was stuck waiting at Greyhound for almost an hour to get my ticket changed.

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:30.600
Ha ha ha ha.

01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:34.600
I see what you did there, sir.

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.600
I missed the bus.

01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:37.600
I couldn't help it, I'm sorry.

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:41.600
I know it's probably not funny, but in years you'll look back and laugh at it.

01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:43.600
It's all good, man.

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:46.600
It's all good.

01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:52.600
Well, I have to ask, what gaming things were going on at the convention?

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:55.600
Would you believe I saw DDR?

01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:56.600
At an anime convention?

01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:58.600
DDR you don't say?

01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:01.600
First I was seen in like five cons.

02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:03.600
Was there Smash Brothers?

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:05.600
Yes, there was.

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.600
I'll be damned.

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:11.600
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. Was there Guitar Hero?

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:12.600
Yes, there was.

02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:14.600
I'm on a fucking roll. Look at this. I'm like the psychic con man.

02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:16.600
Here's the fun thing to ask was if there was...

02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:20.600
Was there a Naruto game?

02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:23.600
Actually, not in the dealer's room.

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:27.600
One of the gaming dealers was showing off one of the Naruto games for PlayStation 2.

02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.600
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:33.600
Psychic con man, hold on, hold on.

02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:41.600
Was there a woman overweight dressed to Sailor Moon?

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:42.600
No.

02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:44.600
Ah, I lose.

02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.600
That's impossible. That's a prerequisite for any con.

02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:51.600
Did you have Manfay? I miss Manfay.

02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:54.600
God, no. I think we shoot him.

02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:58.600
All right. Anything else you want to share with the listeners, Rama?

02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:01.600
There was beat mania, I tell you that much.

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.600
Oh, all right.

02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:10.600
And one thing I loved about the con was they had a place set up in the convention where you could actually sit down and eat on tables.

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:17.600
Wow. Ooh, Frisbee asked a good question. Was there an overweight man dressed to Sailor Moon?

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:21.600
Actually, no. Believe it or not, there really wasn't any overweight people.

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:24.600
There was, but most of them were wearing Lolita outfits.

02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:25.600
Con fails.

02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:26.600
Con fails.

02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:32.600
Metacon is a combination of a, it's a majority of a webcomic convention with anime, sci-fi, fantasy.

02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:34.600
That sounds like fun.

02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:35.600
Yeah, it does.

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:38.600
I forget his name, but the guy that played Neelix on Voyager was there as well.

02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:39.600
Cool.

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:40.600
Ethan something isn't his name?

02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:41.600
I wanted his own.

02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:42.600
Yes.

02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:44.600
You didn't give me his autograph, did you?

02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:47.600
I had no money.

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:50.600
I didn't even know he was there until I showed up Saturday.

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.600
Okay, I forgive you.

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.600
There's a, you know, if you go to...

02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:57.600
You didn't give me your ominous autograph. I mean, that shouldn't be something.

02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:00.600
I know, I found my book. Finally, I found my book.

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:01.600
Woot.

02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:04.600
Yes, dear Richard, there was anime. Tons of it.

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.600
I'll be sending you my book.

02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:08.600
Rama, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, okay?

02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:09.600
You too, all right.

02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:10.600
Later.

02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:12.600
That's great.

02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:14.600
Something tells me the callers are fairly apathetic tonight.

02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.600
Thank you, Ethan Phillips is his game guru. That's his name.

02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:20.600
The other one, you know what, Tuvok is from Sacramento, so you sometimes catch,

02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:23.600
I've never seen him, but I see stories about him on the local news once in a while.

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:27.600
You know, celebrity Tim something, what's his name?

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:29.600
Tim something?

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:31.600
What the hell is Tuvok's name? I don't remember.

02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:32.600
Oh well.

02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:33.600
Let's go to the phone so we have another call.

02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:35.600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.600
Oh my god, we got through.

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:38.600
Yes, we did.

02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:39.600
Hi.

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:41.600
Whoa, we've got like a party chat on the line.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:43.600
Introduce yourselves.

02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:46.600
Wow, this is like a party line from like the 80s or something.

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:47.600
I know.

02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.600
Let's call anything.

02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:50.600
It's party chat.

02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.600
We should meet up at Chuck E. Cheese afterwards.

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:55.600
Who's on the line?

02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:59.600
We've got Toshin, Footy Monster, Jack Ransom, and the Rod D.

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.600
Wow, it's like an all-games party line.

02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:03.600
It is a party line.

02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:04.600
Awesome.

02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:05.600
Call 1-900.

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:06.600
Here to call.

02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:07.600
1-900.

02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:09.600
I'm around, it's always a party. That's the way it rolls.

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:12.600
What do we owe this phone call tonight?

02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:15.600
I just wanted to say I beat your deadline score on Geometry Wars and you're going down.

02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:16.600
F you.

02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:19.600
F you.

02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:21.600
I just did, like five seconds ago.

02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:25.600
Geometry Wars brings out the most competitive in all of us, doesn't it?

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:26.600
Yeah.

02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:27.600
How about my pacifism score?

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.600
It's Geometry Wars, baby.

02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:32.600
Dude, I played pacifism for an hour trying to get that stupid wax off achievement.

02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:34.600
Have you beat my pacifism score?

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:36.600
Um, I don't think so.

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:39.600
Well, at least I'm still cool at something.

02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:43.600
Yeah, but I bumped up my, uh, I know everybody's probably shut up about Geometry Wars,

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:46.600
but I'm up to five million for my deadline.

02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:49.600
Did you hear about the Easter egg in Geometry Wars,

02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.600
that at any point during the game you don't even have to pause it?

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:55.600
You just hit the right bumper and back, and then if you use the sticks,

02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:58.600
the both analog sticks, the game is rendered in 3D.

02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:00.600
It's crazy.

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:03.600
It's so crazy, like, you don't pause the game at all,

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:06.600
just while you're playing it hit the right bumper, not the trigger, but the bumper,

02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:09.600
hit right bumper and the back button, and you can, like, render the field in 3D.

02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:11.600
It's so cool.

02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:13.600
And then if you touch the dot in the room with the dragon ducks,

02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:16.600
then you can see, created by Warren Robinette, and it's awesome.

02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:18.600
It's like that.

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:20.600
Oh, God.

02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:21.600
But in 3D, dude.

02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:22.600
That's awesome.

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:23.600
3D.

02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.600
How do you get, how do you go back?

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.600
Because now it's in the moment of my game.

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:29.600
Uh, hit right bumper and back again.

02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:31.600
Okay, oh, okay, there we go.

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:33.600
Wow, you're playing Geometry Wars while you talk to us?

02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:34.600
That's very impressive.

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:35.600
I know.

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:37.600
So what about the other folks on the line?

02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.600
He's a savant of Geometry Wars.

02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:42.600
Are you guys playing Geometry Wars, or are you guys playing?

02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:47.600
Well, I can't play anything anymore, because my 360 died after five months,

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:48.600
so I can't play anything.

02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:50.600
So, nephew of the week.

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:53.600
Being in Argentina, you're kind of screwed, huh?

02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:54.600
I'm totally screwed.

02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:57.600
I called Microsoft, they said basically, well, fuck you, we don't care.

02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:59.600
And, uh, yeah.

02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:01.600
So I'm out of 500 bucks and a 360.

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:02.600
It's awesome.

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:03.600
That sucks.

02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:05.600
That is crappy customer service.

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:07.600
I mean, I understand you're at a regional, I didn't really do business with it.

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:10.600
I tried, I tried messaging, like, through Twitter to Major Nelson.

02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.600
He tried my luck there.

02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:13.600
Of course, nothing happened.

02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:16.600
Well, yeah, he probably gets 500 emails a day.

02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:17.600
Sucks, though.

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:20.600
I will say this before I end my part of talking here,

02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:23.600
because I know you probably have a lot more calls to take.

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:24.600
Actually, not really tonight.

02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:28.600
But, uh, Rhythm Heaven or Rhythm Tengoku Gold on the DS,

02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:30.600
you guys need to play that.

02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:36.600
I know there's a lot of rhythm fans, you know, in the audience, rhythm game fans.

02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:37.600
You need to play that.

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:41.600
It's like the WarioWare game of rhythm games, and it's so fun.

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.600
Ooh, I like WarioWare.

02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:45.600
Tell us really quickly, is that what the game's like, WarioWare?

02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:51.600
It's, yeah, I imagine, uh, each stage, four, five minigames per stage,

02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:53.600
with a final stage being a remix,

02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:58.600
each game is totally different in gameplay, and it's a small song, or a small thingy.

02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:01.600
And from that, you advance the remix stage,

02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:05.600
and in the remix you play all those minigames crumpled together into one cohesive song.

02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:08.600
So you gotta switch gameplays on the fly all the time.

02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:11.600
And it goes like that for many, many levels, and it's so fun.

02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:17.600
Great music, really catchy, the action on the stylus works perfectly, and it's so fun.

02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:20.600
Alright, sounds pretty cool, I will have to look at that.

02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:27.600
Yeah, I've just been playing an old copy of Super Robot Wars Alpha I got from a friend a while ago,

02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:31.600
since I'll be going to Otacon next week to see Jam Project.

02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:34.600
And actually, I'm gonna meet up with Rama, probably.

02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:38.600
He didn't even know it was too lame to go, even though Rama and I offered to pay his way.

02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:41.600
Aww. What?

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:42.600
Yep.

02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:45.600
Sorry, I have to reflect on that. That's horrible.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:49.600
What about games you've been playing, JackRansom?

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:54.600
Well, my PSP miraculously, after a year and a half, fixed itself this weekend,

02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:57.600
so I decided I'd go out and pick up Patapon.

02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:59.600
Pata-pata-pata-pon!

02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:02.600
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom. That game is nuts!

02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:06.600
Oh, my friend is freaking nuts, and I absolutely love it.

02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:09.600
I actually got how many goddamn great games there were on the PSP.

02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:13.600
You start hearing those little drum beats in your sleep if you've played that game long enough.

02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:15.600
It's terrible. You're lying there, trying to go to sleep, and then,

02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:19.600
PON PON PATA PON PON PON PON PON PON PON PON.

02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:22.600
I cannot wait to get to that stage, because at the moment, I need more of that game.

02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:25.600
I want more of that game. I'm loving it.

02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:28.600
Hooray for a PSP getting a lot of good games lately. It's great.

02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:29.600
Certainly.

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:30.600
All right, well, guys...

02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:31.600
Hooray for the Summer of Arcade...

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:33.600
Sorry, go ahead, Toushin, real quick.

02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:37.600
I said Summer of Arcade for Xbox Live. I'm going to be broke. That's all I'm saying.

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:41.600
For real. I don't know about that Braid game. I'll have to check out the demo first, because I haven't heard much about it.

02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:42.600
I'm skipping that.

02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:45.600
But the rest of that looks great. I know, I'm going to be broke.

02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:50.600
Playing Bionic Force next week. Galaga Legion's the next. I need money.

02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:53.600
You know what, though? If you add it all up, it's the price of, like, Soul Calibur IV.

02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.600
So, honestly, it's, you know...

02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:59.600
That also kicks ass. I highly recommend that for all the Soul Calibur fans.

02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:01.600
Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD coming.

02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:03.600
Oh, yes. Hopefully soon.

02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:07.600
Toushin, we need to play custom characters in Soul Calibur IV. Soon.

02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:09.600
You going to be around later? Because I'm around.

02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:13.600
I might. I have a wow date after the show, but maybe later.

02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:14.600
We'll talk.

02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:17.600
All right. Take care, guys. I've got to let you go. We're going to wrap up the show. Have a good one, though.

02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:18.600
All right.

02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:20.600
Bye, Party Chat.

02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.600
That's great.

02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:28.600
It's like we leveled up together. It was a party adventure.

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:32.600
All right. We're going to go around to this point and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap it up for tonight.

02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:34.600
Let's go ahead and start with...

02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:37.600
And when I say a wow date, I don't mean, like, I'm literally going on a date in wow.

02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:40.600
I mean, I have an appointment or whatever you want to call it.

02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.600
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:43.600
Ouch.

02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:47.600
My final thought is paper cuts really suck.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:49.600
Loki, your final thought?

02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:53.600
Red Bull BC one's actually pretty good on the DS.

02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:55.600
All right.

02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:00.600
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading Orange Launch Radio Independent Podcasting.

02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:06.600
Remember, the only way we survive is that you guys tell two friends about our show and the word continues to travel throughout the galaxy.

02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:09.600
And one day, Yoda and Darth Vader will be in our show.

02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:11.600
Or not.

02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:13.600
But anyhow, tune in. We'll be back next week.

02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:15.600
It's two weeks that we're going to be off.

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:16.600
Next week, we will be back here.

02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:20.600
The All Games Listener Appreciation Month should be in full swing by next week.

02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:24.600
I can tell you there will be a prize token given away to live listeners.

02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:27.600
We will also have a way you can enter over email, so stay tuned for that.

02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:28.600
It's going to be a lot of fun.

02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:33.600
And we'll be seeing those of you that are going to PAX four weeks away, if you can believe it.

02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:35.600
We're going to PAX.

02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.600
We're going to have some seafood and maybe play some video games.

02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:39.600
And?

02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:40.600
And.

02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:41.600
I have to look around the city.

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:43.600
And we need some coffee.

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:44.600
Lots of it.

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:47.600
And we are going to be going to Space Needle at some point.

02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:48.600
Yes.

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:49.600
I have to.

02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:50.600
And I want it to rain.

02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:51.600
And I'm going to try to push Loki off the Space Needle.

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:52.600
And I want it to rain.

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:53.600
Yes.

02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:54.600
Come on, Loki.

02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:55.600
Sounds awesome.

02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:56.600
Alright.

02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:57.600
Alright, have a good one everybody.

02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:58.600
Thank you so much.

02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:23.600
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:30.600
See you next week.
