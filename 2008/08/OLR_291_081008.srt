00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:25,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, August 10th, 2008, Ozzy Osbourne gets ready to rock Guitar Hero, Sega admits to Sonic errors, and Grand Theft Auto 4 PC is announced to no one's surprise.

2
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:33,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

3
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:44,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that video game independent podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:45,264
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:47,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm one of the three hosts here on Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:54,006
[SPEAKER_09]: The other co-hosts with me as always say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:54,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo.

9
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,887
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, Jamie Summers?

10
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:56,628
[SPEAKER_03]: A little warm.

11
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:58,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is a little warm in the studio tonight.

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Not terrible, thank God, compared to weeks past, but just a little... I'm having geek issues.

13
00:01:04,613 --> 00:01:05,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Geek issues?

14
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:06,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Or geek drama?

15
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:07,795
[SPEAKER_09]: What type of geek drama?

16
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:22,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I'm just trying to figure out, essentially, how to move over my ringtones and stuff from my laptop, iTunes, to my PC, so that I can start syncing my iPhone from my PC.

17
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I thought, before the show, you were talking this whole thing about Linux.

18
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:28,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought your geek issues had to do with Linux, not the phone.

19
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:28,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it does.

20
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:39,319
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, because I've decided that instead of using my PC, putting another drive on my PC, I'm going to reformat my laptop to Linux Mint.

21
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I can play with it and not have to worry about the Frank and Vio going... Is it Minty Fresh?

23
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:46,831
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw it.

24
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:48,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty.

25
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:48,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks fresh.

26
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,954
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty and useful.

27
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:54,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when fresh was a word used to describe cool things?

28
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:55,617
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fresh.

29
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:56,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Crescent fresh.

30
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

31
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:01,602
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing, Loki?

32
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:02,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing fine.

33
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:03,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you feeling fresh?

34
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:07,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fresh until this fucking pizza dripped on me.

35
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:08,707
[SPEAKER_10]: So now you're not so fresh?

36
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:09,127
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

37
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:14,233
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I think it's the curse for having white shorts.

38
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:16,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, it's inevitable.

39
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,557
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a magnet for shit.

40
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:20,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's fine, all of a sudden a rogue drop of something will hit the shorts and...

42
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,134
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43
00:02:52,309 --> 00:03:03,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Also present, our always present fourth guest on the show, you in our chat room when you join us live on AllGamesRadio at AllGames.com when we tape Sunday nights right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific.

44
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:07,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Although as of late, Bobby's been running over, eating up our time slot a little bit.

45
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:09,523
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we forgive him because he always has us on at the end of the show anyway.

46
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:13,386
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can always check that out on AllGamesRadio live on Sunday nights.

47
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:18,541
[SPEAKER_09]: and SSJ100 Matt is quoting from Cifaloli.

48
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Calls, calls, calls, calls from the public.

49
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:36,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, we always love having our chatroom on board and the regulars and always some new faces so please feel free to stop by our chatroom chat.orangeloungeradio.com while we are taking live calls and during chat hours when we're taping live on Sunday nights.

50
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,052
[SPEAKER_09]: No Phoenix Wright for reals.

51
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wanted to get on a trial.

52
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wanted to get on a trial.

53
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,179
[SPEAKER_09]: It is fascinating stuff.

54
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody should do it at least once in their life.

55
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be civic-dutied.

56
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:25,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, however, I do actually, I did sit down and start playing Oendon a little bit more, and I'm still playing Aurora Faint on my iPhone, which is crack-tastic.

57
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:25,969
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is fun.

58
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:29,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sudoku and Ragnarok.

59
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:32,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Ragnarok Ragnarok Ragnarok

60
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:51,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that so you can run your storefront in one window and so you can quest in the other?

61
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:53,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, because I play on private servers.

62
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:54,984
[SPEAKER_02]: All I have to do is auto trade.

63
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:55,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I see.

64
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:57,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll vend while I am gone.

65
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:06,588
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it's just so that I really want something that runs a lot more efficiently.

66
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:10,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to make sure that my system is going to be okay with it for me to make the switch.

67
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:30,147
[SPEAKER_02]: and right now I have to figure out because I've tried doing this before trying to get my iTunes my ringtones and contacts and everything to sync on my newer computer and so far iTunes said ah fuck it so as soon as I get that to work I can reinstall on my laptop and see how that goes

68
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:33,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I am considering upgrading the computer here in studio, actually.

69
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:38,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to talk more about next week's plan in just a minute.

70
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:46,511
[SPEAKER_09]: But since it's likely we're not going to be here with a show next week, I'm thinking about taking the time to upgrade the computer here in studio because I have my eyes on some quad-core systems and some fancy stuff.

71
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:50,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can tell it's old because it's that off-white color.

72
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:52,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Because all the computers nowadays are black.

73
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:53,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're black now.

74
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Black is the new off-white.

75
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

76
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:58,277
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

77
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:00,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else for you?

78
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,172
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also doesn't have a window and excessive lights in it.

79
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:05,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to share about your gaming week, DarkSakura?

80
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:12,642
[SPEAKER_02]: My annoyments with my husband because he still hasn't got me The World Ends With You and he was supposed to and he didn't.

81
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:14,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Liar.

82
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:17,908
[SPEAKER_10]: I have it with me if you wish to play it during the break.

83
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:21,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

84
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:25,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and also there was a whole lot of GTA-ing going on in the house.

85
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,747
[SPEAKER_09]: But you still won all to yourself.

86
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,607
[SPEAKER_09]: The world ends with you.

87
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:29,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

88
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:29,868
[SPEAKER_02]: For me.

89
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:30,268
[SPEAKER_09]: For you.

90
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:32,489
[SPEAKER_09]: To have.

91
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:33,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments in chat.

92
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Dreadlock Lord says, Sky, get an Alienware.

93
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And SSJ100 Matt says, Alienware is overpriced.

94
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:38,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Just build one from scratch.

95
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:39,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

96
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of doing the scratch thing, but damn, there are some good deals in those package systems.

97
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:45,834
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so tempting.

98
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:46,515
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

99
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:47,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Newegg.

100
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:49,349
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking about it.

101
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:57,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get so many nerdy emails from nerds everywhere that say I'm stupid, but I have my eye on a gateway.

102
00:06:57,693 --> 00:06:59,494
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really cheap, and it's really good.

103
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:06,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is radio, but I just got the look of shame twice.

104
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, I have a gateway laptop.

105
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:12,962
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because you can't build a laptop from scratch.

106
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,103
[SPEAKER_10]: And trust me, I looked.

107
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:18,270
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to build one from scratch, even if it's the ugliest piece of shit thing ever.

108
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,890
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as I built it from scratch.

109
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,271
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, I got this because it was an open box and it was just, price was right at the time.

110
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:36,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have a... One of my friends does a little bit of laptop tweaking and can build a Mac as long as it has the right hardware in it.

111
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:37,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my iBook.

112
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:38,475
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough Mac for me.

113
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:39,155
[SPEAKER_09]: For the house.

114
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:42,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually, as soon as I get money set aside for it, I'm having him...

115
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:46,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Help me with building a Mac from scratch.

116
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,740
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of hardware is required?

117
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,941
[SPEAKER_10]: A Heen element for toast?

118
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:51,783
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

119
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:56,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a Mac because I deal with artsy stuff all the time and I need it.

120
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:57,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So, shut up.

121
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:57,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you what.

122
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:01,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Having edited movies on PC and Mac now, it's so much easier on the Mac.

123
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,513
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so much easier to edit movies on the Mac.

124
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:04,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, look.

125
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:07,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every computer is meant for games.

126
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:09,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to games for a minute.

127
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

128
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:11,978
[SPEAKER_10]: My gaming week was alright.

129
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:13,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't play too much.

130
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to catch up with stuff that I meant to play.

131
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,541
[SPEAKER_10]: This week I did check out Braid because I was like, hmm, I haven't made a random purchase online yet.

132
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:23,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Random!

133
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:23,741
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

134
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:24,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy that.

135
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:26,962
[SPEAKER_10]: So I bought it.

136
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:28,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I think...

137
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:32,156
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, because the big thing right now is that $15 is worth it.

138
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:41,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I think everyone's kind of not really concerned whether this game's worth $15, but when these games that are $15 start selling, Microsoft goes, oh, so they'll pay $15.

139
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:46,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we're going to make all of them $15, and now $20.

140
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they'll pay $20.

141
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:49,948
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll make them all $20, and now $25.

142
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:51,569
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the price of gasoline.

143
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:53,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just saying something about this the other day.

144
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,733
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how gas prices have been coming down lately, and it's about, like, what, $3.90 a gallon locally now?

145
00:08:58,013 --> 00:08:58,654
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody's going,

146
00:08:58,914 --> 00:08:59,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray!

147
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:01,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Gas is under $4 a gallon, hooray!

148
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:03,817
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, that's what they want you to think.

149
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:07,840
[SPEAKER_09]: They want you to think you're getting a good deal, but you've got to remember, a year ago, it was $2.90.

150
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And even that was high.

151
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:12,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So, don't buy into that.

152
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:22,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, and that's what's going on with this, is I think the gamers are trying to tell Microsoft, hey, listen, we're going to buy this game, but we don't expect all these games to be $15, and we're not going to fucking buy all of them.

153
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, all that being said, I think Braid is worth $15.

154
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say it's worth $10.

155
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:56,293
[SPEAKER_10]: but that's about it and the only reason because it it's quick I mean I know you said you had a little bit of problems with it because I'm stupid and it takes me a long time to figure out these puzzles I'm almost all the way through the game and it's only been about two hours and it's just I mean there's some of the puzzles later on are a little bit tricky but the first few ones I kind of figured out what they want me to do really quick and I kind of look back at this and like okay there's going to be speed runs you can do throughout the game um

156
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:59,556
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's really the only replayability.

157
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:02,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Quickly though, because I knew nothing about Braid.

158
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:04,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely zilch about this game.

159
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,343
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I might have heard it mentioned out of a game developers conference once or twice.

160
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:14,969
[SPEAKER_09]: But about the game itself, I knew nothing about it except that it was supposedly this really critically acclaimed game until I got my hands on it this week.

161
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:18,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So for those of our listeners who have no Xbox 360, what is this game all about?

162
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:20,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to hear the Loki version of this.

163
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,357
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about this dude who's going around and...

164
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:29,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Being all emo about the fact that you lost somebody and you're searching for something.

165
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:32,347
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be honest, it's like, text, text, text, I'm walking past it all.

166
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,309
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, thank God you can bypass the story.

167
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,070
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I read it.

168
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I did.

169
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I read it, okay?

170
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,073
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was just like, okay.

171
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:50,696
[SPEAKER_10]: My whole thing is, like, there's one of them that sounds like, you know, he had a wife or something, but now he's going after some other chick and

172
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:55,627
[SPEAKER_10]: He left her to go find this old flame or princess or whatever.

173
00:10:55,967 --> 00:11:00,890
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm thinking, you're just going to realize that you lost your wife because you're an idiot.

174
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:10,416
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, this guy is some crazy dude that's got a tie and walking through this world that's a ripoff of Super Mario Bros.

175
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,199
[SPEAKER_09]: But the game is nothing like Super Mario Bros.

176
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:14,719
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the thing, though.

177
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

178
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,101
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, it is...

179
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

180
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:21,997
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got really cool, unique gameplay elements to it.

181
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:27,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Portal could take notice of this, and maybe this would be perfect for Portal 2.

182
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:30,764
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

183
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:39,892
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some things, though, that I did read that, you know, there's eight hidden stars in the game, which may unlock some more stuff later, which would be kind of cool.

184
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:46,598
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's just... Once you're done with the game, I don't see it really going... I guess it's like Portal a little bit.

185
00:11:46,658 --> 00:11:47,639
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you don't really go back.

186
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,042
[SPEAKER_09]: But they built the speedrun thing into it, the speedrun contest, which I thought was kind of interesting.

187
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, once you beat it once, you can go through and do the speedruns.

188
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:56,446
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm too stupid to beat it even once.

189
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this game makes you feel like a dummy.

190
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know You're smart, you got more pieces than I do

191
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:37,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm also trying to be a completist, so I won't continue on until... Unless that last level, because I got pissed off with it, so I just ran all the way through.

192
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:41,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just ran all the way through all the levels once, and then I went back and tried to beat them.

193
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,062
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, um...

194
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:44,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

195
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,815
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be cooler if it was longer.

196
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:51,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully they'll have some download stuff later because that would be pretty cool for it.

197
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, enough with Braid.

198
00:12:54,281 --> 00:13:02,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I also played this week the demo for Battle Fantasia which is like this weird medieval anime fighting game type thing.

199
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:04,649
[SPEAKER_10]: It was okay.

200
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

201
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:06,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about that game.

202
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,111
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of it?

203
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:08,972
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty.

204
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:11,654
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all 3D and stuff but...

205
00:13:13,177 --> 00:13:13,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

206
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Check it out.

207
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:41,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Then Grand Theft Auto 4.

208
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I also got my 360 back from Microsoft being repaired.

209
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:48,213
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually really quick, which I was surprised.

210
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:50,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So that went pretty well.

211
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:55,355
[SPEAKER_10]: I kept the old box just in case another one dies because so far a track record's been like 5 out of 6.

212
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Or 7 if you include the new one I bought.

213
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:02,257
[SPEAKER_10]: So... Yeah.

214
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:03,317
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about it.

215
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:05,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking... Definitely looking forward this week for...

216
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:08,086
[SPEAKER_10]: by Commando.

217
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that this week?

218
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:10,087
[SPEAKER_09]: That's this week.

219
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:11,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that should be fun.

220
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:16,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox did a good thing with this whole Xbox Live Arcade for August.

221
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:23,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Between Geometry Wars 2 last week, which I'm still playing, and Braid this week, I'm busy.

222
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:25,535
[SPEAKER_09]: I've barely been touching Soul Calibur.

223
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:29,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the only time I played Soul Calibur at all this week was when one of the listeners wanted to do some fightin'.

224
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:31,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I did.

225
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:38,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't get to play a lot this week because I was actually... I'm sorry, I felt bad because another listener wanted to battle me and I was too into Braid.

226
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:42,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I just ignored all the messages that were popping up and I'm like, oh, I should go look at them.

227
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:45,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the poor guy wants to play, he's so clever, and here I am all sucked into Braid.

228
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:52,408
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it was just this week I didn't get to play a lot because I was doing some video editing for something I'm making for work.

229
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:55,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also didn't get to work on the PSP website at all, but...

230
00:14:57,415 --> 00:14:58,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

231
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,441
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

232
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:38,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Knight, Dark Knight, Dark Knight

233
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:01,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong.

234
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not bashing the Dark Knight.

235
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:03,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Great movie.

236
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:07,558
[SPEAKER_09]: But why is it okay to spend $30 there, but yet $15 feels like such a ripoff?

237
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:10,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's apples and oranges.

238
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I get what you're saying.

239
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:14,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I completely understand what you're saying about the whole you don't want to set a precedent for Microsoft.

240
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:19,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Because especially the fact that, okay, then there's games like Fusion Frenzy 2 that cost, what, $50?

241
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,311
[SPEAKER_09]: That entertain me for 30 seconds.

242
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:23,593
[SPEAKER_09]: You're out of time for the logo to get on and off the screen.

243
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:23,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

244
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,313
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a retarded argument.

245
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:28,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand what Penny Arcade was trying to say, but it's fucking a retarded argument.

246
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:31,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, let's go to Disneyland, because you can spend a day there.

247
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:33,315
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about eight hours, and you spend $100.

248
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:38,416
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's charge $100 for every fucking online game, because it's over eight hours of entertainment.

249
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,156
[SPEAKER_10]: That's retarded.

250
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:48,997
[SPEAKER_02]: However, however, however, I can absolutely disprove that there's any validity to that argument, because going to Disneyland is like paying for 30 MMOs.

251
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:51,138
[SPEAKER_09]: And going to Disneyland has Space Mountain.

252
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:51,698
[SPEAKER_09]: End of story.

253
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:54,019
[SPEAKER_09]: End of argument.

254
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,980
[SPEAKER_02]: California Screamin'.

255
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:55,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, fine.

256
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:58,162
[SPEAKER_10]: You pay $50 for console games.

257
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:00,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't you pay $50 for this online game?

258
00:17:00,964 --> 00:17:07,029
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's only 6 hours long or 8 hours long, but some console games, because they suck, are only 8 hours long as well.

259
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:09,258
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

260
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:34,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anybody, a quick, quick poll in chat, folks, chat.orange.radio.com, did anyone drop $10 on that crossword game?

261
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:35,508
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want to know.

262
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:37,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you really need the achievement points that bad?

263
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:42,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be shy, this is a real needy survey, because I want to know if anyone dropped $10 on that game.

264
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:46,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Now... Because it wasn't worth it and it sends a message.

265
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:50,121
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do give them props for having demos for this stuff, which is nice.

266
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:57,225
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they really need to do because there's some companies, Nintendo, that don't put demos for their games up there.

267
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:59,867
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you buy it and you're like, wow, this sucks.

268
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:02,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I get my money back?

269
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:02,889
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

270
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:04,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, fuck you.

271
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,370
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not buying it anymore.

272
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

273
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:08,132
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just...

274
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:17,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about it because games like this are going to sell well and they're going to say, hey, people are going to be willing to pay this kind of money, so let's raise the price.

275
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:25,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, we'll just use the excuse that my game's small and I'm an independent publisher and if you don't buy my game at $15, I don't make any money.

276
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:32,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, you know, oh, development costs are going up more and we need more money for this stuff.

277
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:34,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I mean...

278
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:37,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Development costs for a game?

279
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:38,126
[SPEAKER_10]: No offense.

280
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,287
[SPEAKER_10]: The art style is awesome.

281
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:40,248
[SPEAKER_10]: The engine is pretty cool.

282
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:41,389
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that took some time.

283
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,053
[SPEAKER_10]: But seriously, they're Goombas.

284
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,216
[SPEAKER_09]: They're piranha plants.

285
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:49,357
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much more to it than that.

286
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:51,238
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to have to disagree.

287
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:53,160
[SPEAKER_09]: That happens sometimes when you have three people on a show.

288
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I say it's worth it and go spend the money right now.

289
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo will sue.

290
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's...

291
00:18:58,803 --> 00:18:59,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo has nothing to sue over.

292
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:03,725
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is an homage to Mario Bros.

293
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:06,566
[SPEAKER_09]: and Donkey Kong and other games.

294
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,568
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, did you notice that the Donkey Kong level was called Jumpman?

295
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:13,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is Mario's name in Donkey Kong.

296
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:14,750
[SPEAKER_09]: What about stories, right?

297
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,356
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you really need to check out Braid.

298
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:22,398
[SPEAKER_09]: You really do.

299
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:30,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I planned on it and actually I added Major Nelson to my Twitter and so he put up a download code up for it.

300
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:31,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you get it?

301
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:31,759
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.

302
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:32,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at work.

303
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, then somebody else did.

304
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,803
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just saying, you know, if anyone wants to check out some of these games, you know, for free as they come up, he's doing crap like this all the time on Twitter.

305
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:42,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Just pray you're first.

306
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:43,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

307
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:43,585
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

308
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:45,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Results of our quick poll in chat.

309
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Did anyone buy the crosswords game?

310
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:48,587
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, nope.

311
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:48,987
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

312
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:49,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell no.

313
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:50,428
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

314
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:51,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even know there was a crossword game.

315
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:52,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Flash games, anyone?

316
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:53,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

317
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:54,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell no.

318
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,710
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

319
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,991
[SPEAKER_09]: And so on.

320
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:57,912
[SPEAKER_09]: So I didn't see anyone say yes.

321
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:00,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, just kind of throwing that out there.

322
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:06,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, the rest of my gaming week, Geometry Wars 2, WoW, Soul Calibur, pretty much nothing else new besides Braid.

323
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:10,969
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's okay, because Braid was a worthwhile expenditure this week.

324
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's it for my gaming week.

325
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:15,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into tonight's housekeeping.

326
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,552
[SPEAKER_09]: My Vegas trip I talked about last week got canceled due to personal reasons.

327
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:20,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing bad.

328
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,393
[SPEAKER_09]: It just didn't end up being able to do it.

329
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:30,757
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're still, because some of us kind of banked on there not being a show next week, we may still not be here, especially because...

330
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:32,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

331
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:48,128
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com.

332
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:09,403
[SPEAKER_09]: The other housekeeping thing I wanted to say, iTunes reviews.

333
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Please be so kind to leave us a five-star review on iTunes.

334
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Just search for Orange Launch Radio.

335
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:33,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Leave us a nice review.

336
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:38,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be posting the link in chat shortly if you guys would be so kind to post some reviews.

337
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:40,134
[SPEAKER_09]: We would heart that very muchly.

338
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:44,316
[SPEAKER_09]: It helps because the more positive reviews, it helps the ranking.

339
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:46,557
[SPEAKER_09]: The higher the ranking, the more likely people are to find us.

340
00:21:46,977 --> 00:21:57,022
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, nothing against the shows that are all top-rated, but 80% of them are commercial, like G4, 1UP, GameSpot-style casts that don't need that attention.

341
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:57,643
[SPEAKER_09]: What did Quiltipo say?

342
00:21:57,703 --> 00:21:58,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Waterboarding.

343
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:22,419
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell is that?

344
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea, but I'm just saying... It sounds deadly.

345
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:27,422
[SPEAKER_02]: We endorse thinking for yourself.

346
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:34,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Waterboarding is where you pour water over someone's face when you're interrogating them and it gives them the sensation of drowning.

347
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:38,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently there's some big controversy going on in the government because they do that too.

348
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:39,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

349
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:40,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

350
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:42,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I do remember reading a politically oriented story on that now.

351
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:49,460
[SPEAKER_02]: However, what we endorse is thinking for yourself and acting responsibly within the confines of your own concept of morality.

352
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:50,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that work?

353
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:52,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, do that.

354
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:53,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

355
00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:54,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

356
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:59,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, we have to pause the show.

357
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:00,668
[SPEAKER_10]: We hear an ice cream truck.

358
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:01,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Loki.

359
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,090
[SPEAKER_10]: The ice cream man does not have that kind of base.

360
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:05,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

361
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,233
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the gangsta.

362
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Ice cream man.

363
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:11,176
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had an ice cream truck, you know.

364
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, gaming news.

365
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:14,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to it.

366
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:18,362
[SPEAKER_10]: If you are an attractive person looking for a cool game, well...

367
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:19,716
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

368
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:49,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Mace Suma says, so in other words, OLR supports torture?

369
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:50,718
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

370
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,604
[SPEAKER_02]: We just support people thinking for themselves and doing whatever they feel is morally and ethically correct.

371
00:23:57,724 --> 00:24:02,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, some of these past episodes that we've done, well... Anyhow, Strong Bad.

372
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you excited about the Strong Bad game?

373
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:07,393
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I never was one into Homestar Runner.

374
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:08,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, then screw you.

375
00:24:08,394 --> 00:24:10,176
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, I know you like Homestar Runner.

376
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:11,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to check out the game?

377
00:24:11,837 --> 00:24:12,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah!

378
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:15,524
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a cool and attractive person.

379
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:17,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to download it on PC, Rob?

380
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:21,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I will check it out on PC since I'm having issues.

381
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:26,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is a bummer because somebody I know is... I don't know how much I should say.

382
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I should be getting the Wii one, but I'm not.

383
00:24:28,174 --> 00:24:29,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get the PC one.

384
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still supporting it one way or the other.

385
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:32,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I get to revisit.

386
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:32,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

387
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:35,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't even watched Homestar Runner in like two years.

388
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:38,081
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of one of those, oh, it's revisiting an old friend.

389
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:40,162
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my plan.

390
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:41,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I demand an Ask a Ninja game.

391
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:44,779
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll never... We'll see, we'll see.

392
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:45,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Someday.

393
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

394
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:47,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So there it is.

395
00:24:48,342 --> 00:24:49,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Check that out next week.

396
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:51,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, or Monday even, you don't even have to wait a week.

397
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:59,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, also on the Wii, Rock Band 2, and apparently they are saying that Rock Band 2 is not going to hold back on any of the features that you know from the other Rock Band games.

398
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Meaning, like, download content.

399
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:04,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, that's something the first Rock Band was sorely missing.

400
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:07,675
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to put the bonus songs on the disc and call it like a bonus exclusive.

401
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:08,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently...

402
00:25:09,316 --> 00:25:28,623
[SPEAKER_09]: uh you're going to be able to download songs do the whole online thing make your own rocker drummer whatever uh apparently this is coming from Wired Magazine Wired is saying that the Wii version of Rock Band 2 is going to be and this is right out of Harmonix's mouth fully featured DLC online play it's going to be a much more competitive product

403
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:30,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they know something we don't?

404
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:30,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, exactly.

405
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:35,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious to see what magical little thing is going to be implemented between now and whenever this game comes out.

406
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:36,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

407
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:39,448
[SPEAKER_09]: So, very interesting.

408
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:44,250
[SPEAKER_09]: But good news for Wii owners, especially those that want to have Rock Band.

409
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:53,174
[SPEAKER_09]: If you didn't pony up the money for an Xbox or PlayStation 3 and this is all you got in your house and you want to experience Rock Band, I'm glad to hear finally you won't be...

410
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:56,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

411
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:18,089
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

412
00:26:43,342 --> 00:26:43,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Games!

413
00:26:44,022 --> 00:26:45,023
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura games!

414
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, Mega Man 9, as we know, is going to be nestastic.

415
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:53,608
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you've got an option to make it even more nestastic.

416
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:55,169
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make it flicker!

417
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,330
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

418
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Real flicker.

419
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:02,133
[SPEAKER_02]: As a built-in bug in the game, if you so choose to activate it.

420
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:09,538
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for anyone who is so young that they don't know what flicker is, this is a good way to discover what we grew up with.

421
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:18,457
[SPEAKER_10]: This is awesome too because companies like EA and Ubisoft and stuff like that tend to release games that have a few glitches in it.

422
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:19,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, don't worry!

423
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It was intentional for your save to get deleted.

424
00:27:23,323 --> 00:27:24,024
[SPEAKER_10]: It's retro.

425
00:27:24,864 --> 00:27:25,745
[SPEAKER_10]: You like retro.

426
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:29,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in this case, you can select if you want it on or off.

427
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:36,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also saying that there's going to be other types of glitches that you would commonly find.

428
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:43,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, I found the glitch in Mega Man 3 by myself where you can kill yourself.

429
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:53,807
[SPEAKER_02]: You jump down a hole and then you hold the left and right button so that you do the super jump and you lose all of your life and you can't shoot anything but you can still use your weapons.

430
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:55,808
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're invincible.

431
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:57,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're dead.

432
00:27:57,729 --> 00:27:58,729
[SPEAKER_02]: You're undead Mega Man.

433
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say this from chat because this kind of goes along with the story.

434
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says Mega Man 9 will have flickers and bugs.

435
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:05,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay for NES.

436
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:09,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is this exciting news that we're going to have bugs in the game?

437
00:28:09,552 --> 00:28:11,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, granted they're optional but why is this exciting?

438
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:21,376
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that you can pick because the whole purpose of the game is to have the experience of playing one of the old 8-bit versions of a Mega Man game.

439
00:28:21,696 --> 00:28:28,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Which technically that's what it is, and if you want to have it the way the other ones were, you can have it the way the other ones were if you want to.

440
00:28:29,502 --> 00:28:32,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Why complain about something that you can turn on or off?

441
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:34,826
[SPEAKER_02]: That earns you the STFU award.

442
00:28:34,906 --> 00:28:35,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

443
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:36,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive-thru, please.

444
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:39,930
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really so much that, but the fact that it's like, OMG, news!

445
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,311
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

446
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:42,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is newsworthy.

447
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:44,333
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.

448
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:44,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give it that.

449
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:49,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's basically everyone's excited about the attention to details like that.

450
00:28:51,366 --> 00:28:51,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see that.

451
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:52,667
[SPEAKER_10]: I could give it that.

452
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:57,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I still say... Fine.

453
00:28:58,353 --> 00:28:58,773
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I say.

454
00:28:58,833 --> 00:28:59,474
[SPEAKER_09]: So noted.

455
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:06,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, put that on the OLR wiki, please, that DarkSakura's official statement on this episode is...

456
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:17,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, one series that's been known for a few glitches at least, in fact a glitch-themed musical number that was released on the internet, Saints Row.

457
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:22,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Saints Row 2 will not be coming to the Wii, which is not surprising.

458
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:33,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, the concerns are over controversy that a game like that may cause, and also the fact that the graphics on the Wii aren't exactly what they are on the Xbox 360.

459
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:48,732
[SPEAKER_10]: They basically are worried that because if you had weak controls for like chainsaws and satchel charges and stuff like that in the game that you may risk running into an adults only raiding kind of like Manhunt 2 did.

460
00:29:50,762 --> 00:30:19,806
[SPEAKER_10]: but I think that's stupid that they think that scene is there's been games out there that have had similar things already and been released mature and have done pretty well like Scarface or The Godfather or I don't know No More Heroes or Mad World that's coming out so I guess we'll just leave it to graphics I was going to say isn't this game just I mean controversy aside isn't this game just kind of too much graphically for the Wii?

461
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:21,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

462
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:25,309
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it then, right?

463
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:26,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Why play the controversy card?

464
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

465
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't people just accept the fact that the Wii can't handle it, period?

466
00:30:31,251 --> 00:30:31,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

467
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:32,491
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

468
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:32,731
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weird.

469
00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:45,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, what they need to do is have... It's going to take people releasing a big-name game, like another Grand Theft Auto that's on the Wii, before companies decide, hey, the Wii's viable for that kind of game.

470
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:45,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Because right now...

471
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:57,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though there has been some mature games on there and they're starting to get a little bit more adult content, it's still perceived as a kid's system, just like the GameCube was.

472
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:00,710
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really having trouble getting past that stigmata.

473
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo isn't helping.

474
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:05,992
[SPEAKER_10]: They're definitely not helping with Wii music and shit like that.

475
00:31:08,474 --> 00:31:15,517
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really going to take a big game like Grand Theft Auto coming out on it before people go, hey, we can release our game on there and actually make it for the Wii only.

476
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,700
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, fair enough.

477
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, look, one thing that is certainly exclusive to the Wii that we haven't seen on other systems yet is waggling and motion.

478
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:30,905
[SPEAKER_09]: And motion's about to get even better when Wii Sports Resort comes out and the Motion Plus accessory comes out.

479
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:35,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the Motion Plus was developed by a company called InvenSense, actually made this accessory.

480
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:39,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, news came out this week that this Motion Plus technology exists.

481
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:48,253
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no exclusive deal with Nintendo, meaning that if InvenSense wanted to, they could take this technology to other companies.

482
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:50,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you listening, Sony or Microsoft?

483
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:26,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there's more interest out there so you know rumors have been abounding for a long time that Microsoft is going to get into the whole motion game although they didn't at E3 which was the expected time personally I don't see the other consoles getting into this whole motion thing in the motion plus you know where I bet this accessory ends up turning up again PC I bet you we see some type of small scale release of this accessory on a PC

484
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:28,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my thing.

485
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:34,068
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're Nintendo and you're concerned about having all your proprietary stuff...

486
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:48,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you put out this peripheral that's supposed to make things better and supposed to make things extremely lifelike or very sensitive to your movements and then you don't make it exclusive to yourself?

487
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:49,015
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of retarded.

488
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:53,898
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, I made this really awesome invention that'll make our game system awesome and no one else can have it.

489
00:32:54,018 --> 00:32:54,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wait, no they can.

490
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:57,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Now GameGuru in chat has a comment that's kind of along those lines.

491
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,662
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, but Nintendo owns the patent on the pointer and that's the big plus for the Wii.

492
00:33:02,002 --> 00:33:02,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, if

493
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:10,028
[SPEAKER_09]: This MotionPlus technology were to be adapted by the other companies, they wouldn't be able to do it in that same style that the Wii does.

494
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:13,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't know.

495
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:16,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, I mean, I think this is going to be like Rock Band and Guitar Hero.

496
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:21,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe PlayStation will adopt this technology and they'll have 12 axes.

497
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:27,179
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll just, what they'll do is they'll make something that will work exactly the same.

498
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:30,081
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be just different enough so that they can't get sued.

499
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:30,642
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

500
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:32,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Over Rondo of Blood

501
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,000
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a fight at PAX.

502
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

503
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:51,183
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said that I would win because girls play dirty.

504
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, all three of us are going to be at PAX in like three weeks.

505
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:54,105
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be great.

506
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Three weeks from today.

507
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:59,229
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to be flying home, but we will have just spent the weekend at PAX.

508
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:03,712
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't use the elect beam posture trick on me because the blaster master grenade trick is stronger.

509
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:05,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming news?

510
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:07,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I counter with my Konami code.

511
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:08,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha!

512
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:08,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

513
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:10,017
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to LARP to the death.

514
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:10,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I?

515
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:13,380
[SPEAKER_09]: LARP to the death.

516
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I?

517
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:15,468
[SPEAKER_09]: 8 now and whatever the hell 9 on DS soon

518
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:43,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I know!

519
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:45,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the DS one.

520
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:55,166
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about Dragon Quest, the Chapters of the Chosen, which is in the trilogy of The Hand of the Heavenly Bride and the Realms of Reverie coming next.

521
00:34:56,446 --> 00:35:02,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's supposed to be released in... Okay, here's what it is.

522
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:06,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest IV was released on the NES in...

523
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:34,379
[SPEAKER_02]: February 1990 it was Dragon Warrior 4 over here so this is a DS remake is what they're getting and they said that they're supposed to get it on September 12th over in Europe so hey cool and you get that you know fantastic Toriyama artwork so go for it cool the end oh not just the end there's more but wait even more more money more prizes I love it anyway

524
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:37,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone gets a dollar if they guess what game that's from.

525
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:38,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Smash TV.

526
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:39,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my dollar?

527
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:41,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave you a dollar before.

528
00:35:42,197 --> 00:35:44,278
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a retro dollar, so I've already given it to you.

529
00:35:44,298 --> 00:35:45,598
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I buy with a retro dollar?

530
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:46,538
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes song.

531
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:48,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

532
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:51,059
[SPEAKER_10]: You can buy flashing graphics.

533
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:53,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, I can buy flashing retro graphics.

534
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember things the way they used to be.

535
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Chrono Trigger!

536
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:57,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, yes.

537
00:35:58,401 --> 00:35:59,941
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that gets Rob's attention.

538
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,282
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been a kind of...

539
00:36:03,322 --> 00:36:05,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the PlayStation one came out.

540
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:32,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

541
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:32,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

542
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought the Super Nintendo one never did, though.

543
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:36,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're right.

544
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:37,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be wrong.

545
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:38,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that your update disappeared.

546
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:41,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was for... No, I think that's something else.

547
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:44,532
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

548
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:45,253
[SPEAKER_09]: What else was I going to say?

549
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:45,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

550
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:46,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there more?

551
00:36:46,194 --> 00:36:46,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

552
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:46,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

553
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:47,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, go ahead.

554
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:49,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Hart.

555
00:36:49,736 --> 00:36:49,957
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

556
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:55,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, but really the DS version, the things it's going to have is a touchscreen control.

557
00:36:56,142 --> 00:37:02,567
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use both the dual screens, a new dungeon, wireless play of some unnamed variety.

558
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:05,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually...

559
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:09,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

560
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:18,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also, just if anyone is curious, there is a gallery up on Eurogamer that has screenshots.

561
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:20,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll link that in the chat room if anyone wants to check it out.

562
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,684
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, chat.orangeandre.com if you want to join our chat room.

563
00:37:24,704 --> 00:37:30,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew what it was I wanted to ask you about because we were talking about old video games and collecting and all that stuff.

564
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:30,110
42.

565
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, sure.

566
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:32,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

567
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:36,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to a local record store the other day that was having a big video game sale, used video game sale.

568
00:37:36,997 --> 00:37:40,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I found Zelda II The Adventures of Link in a gold cartridge for $5.

569
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:42,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a good deal?

570
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:43,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd say so.

571
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:44,670
[SPEAKER_09]: I should have picked that up.

572
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was looking at it going, wasn't that the first Zelda they remade in the gray carts?

573
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:51,756
[SPEAKER_09]: So the gold carts are really valuable?

574
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Or am I crazy?

575
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,100
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're neat.

576
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you've got the box.

577
00:37:58,882 --> 00:38:01,064
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be worth $5 just to have the old school cart.

578
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:04,127
[SPEAKER_09]: We can put it up on the wall in the big blank spot we have on JustinTV.

579
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:05,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pointing at the blank spot.

580
00:38:05,328 --> 00:38:07,630
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing to watch out for those is the battery.

581
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:09,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I wouldn't play the game.

582
00:38:09,474 --> 00:38:11,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have an old school Nintendo to play it on.

583
00:38:11,176 --> 00:38:13,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I told you I was going to lend you one if I can find one.

584
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you replace the battery?

585
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,161
[SPEAKER_02]: You can replace the battery.

586
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:19,585
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm right, I think it just uses a standard small lithium battery.

587
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:23,429
[SPEAKER_02]: We replace the batteries in our Saturn all the time.

588
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean all the damn time.

589
00:38:26,914 --> 00:38:27,595
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, fair enough.

590
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, all right, let's move on.

591
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:33,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to derail the current gaming news, but I just had to know good deals or not.

592
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:34,920
[SPEAKER_12]: We're doing a public service.

593
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Good deal, bad deal.

594
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:37,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Good deal, bad deal.

595
00:38:37,342 --> 00:38:38,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Your batteries can be saved.

596
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:42,186
[SPEAKER_09]: The store was advertising a huge video game blowout.

597
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:43,266
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like five games for $13.

598
00:38:45,037 --> 00:38:45,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Old NES Games

599
00:39:11,232 --> 00:39:12,253
[SPEAKER_09]: They had some in there.

600
00:39:12,413 --> 00:39:12,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah.

601
00:39:12,953 --> 00:39:13,833
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where I saw Zelda.

602
00:39:14,314 --> 00:39:25,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, originally, before I bought you Blastworks, my intention was to go there and find an original copy of The Guardian Legend, which obviously wouldn't be there because it's too valuable, but, you know.

603
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Pala Abdul Spellbound

604
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:51,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, that was the one with Rush Rush on it, wasn't it?

605
00:39:51,417 --> 00:40:02,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes it was, and it also had such awesome songs as The Promise of a New Day, which I was trying to play a clip of here on air, but my computer's freezing up on me, which probably is a good thing.

606
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:03,486
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it has a taste screen.

607
00:40:06,689 --> 00:40:07,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Two dollars for this!

608
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:10,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Diet Coke, yo!

609
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:15,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, please.

610
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:17,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Promise of a new game, Loki?

611
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:18,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Please stop that.

612
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,555
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a pretty cool hack that got released this week on the Wii.

613
00:40:24,435 --> 00:40:32,977
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will allow you to actually play region-free Wii games with no mod chips whatsoever.

614
00:40:34,158 --> 00:40:37,398
[SPEAKER_10]: This will require, though, that you have the Homebrew channel installed.

615
00:40:38,379 --> 00:40:38,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

616
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:40,860
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

617
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:26,308
[SPEAKER_10]: and you can also remove the health warning screen that pops up in the beginning of when you turn the Wii on well thank god because that thing annoys me more than anything I believe you have to have Wii system version 3.2 I want to say so which unfortunately if you have it all the way updated now you can't use this I'm sorry I can't stop laughing

618
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,888
[SPEAKER_09]: at the fact that somebody actually sat there and said, you know what I'm going to do to my Wii?

619
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,213
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what project I'm going to take on?

620
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:37,421
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get rid of that health warning screen because damn it, that thing's annoying.

621
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, people are starving in other countries and war breaks out.

622
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:47,844
[SPEAKER_09]: But you got rid of the health warning.

623
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:48,444
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it is.

624
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:52,867
[SPEAKER_10]: The process to patch it is safe so you won't brick your console.

625
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:58,790
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing that will happen is if you update your console again, it will erase all these updates that you've just made to it.

626
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,471
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only problem.

627
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:03,433
[SPEAKER_10]: But they are working on ways to prevent that.

628
00:42:03,593 --> 00:42:07,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I think it's only compatible right now with...

629
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:10,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Version 3.2 firmware.

630
00:42:11,202 --> 00:42:15,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft is saying in chat that patch is only for Europe, Loki, with patching quotes.

631
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:18,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was for more than just Europe.

632
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:24,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone really need to remove the health warning screen that bad?

633
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:24,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, really?

634
00:42:25,388 --> 00:42:25,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

635
00:42:26,408 --> 00:42:26,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

636
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:27,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it that intrusive?

637
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:29,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you should be reading it.

638
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:34,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else in the Wii hacking world going on that we should be aware of?

639
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:36,293
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that would be it.

640
00:42:36,713 --> 00:42:36,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

641
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:38,838
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

642
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:08,696
[SPEAKER_09]: and what apparently Game Daily, in this interview, he says that he kind of admits in a way that Sonic has not been quite as good as it could have been.

643
00:43:09,076 --> 00:43:13,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he didn't come out and say Sonic sucks, but there was this interesting quote.

644
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:15,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of that criticism is probably warranted.

645
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:22,041
[SPEAKER_09]: We definitely recognize that a franchise that has been going as long as Sonic, you have to put a huge amount of effort in to make sure that you maintain that quality.

646
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:50,906
[SPEAKER_09]: which is why you're seeing us this year take the first steps in making sure the quality is right and we're constantly looking at innovation blending classic 2D gameplay with 3D beautiful landscape rich environments and then it continues on for fans of Sonic that have been looking for the next gen experience this is the game they've been waiting for so I guess all those other games were just I like the way he does that with words kind of sweeps the other games under the table oh no no this is the game you've been waiting for right here this is the good stuff

647
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

648
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:53,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Mean it.

649
00:43:53,801 --> 00:44:00,385
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I say and mean it because you only got so many chances left before people just, you know, aren't buying this anymore.

650
00:44:00,646 --> 00:44:01,646
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, I don't know.

651
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:06,089
[SPEAKER_09]: You could make 20 crappy Sonic games and if one comes out and it's really good, word will get around.

652
00:44:06,149 --> 00:44:06,810
[SPEAKER_09]: People will buy it.

653
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:09,913
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just about time they say, yeah, we fucked up.

654
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:17,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to ask you, as a Sonic fangirl, I mean, general Sega fangirl in general, look at your Classic Games of the Week.

655
00:44:18,576 --> 00:44:22,117
[SPEAKER_02]: The last Sonic game that they did right was the first Sonic Adventure, I thought.

656
00:44:22,797 --> 00:44:27,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did like, what was the racing game that they had on PSP?

657
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:29,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic Rush, wasn't it?

658
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:29,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

659
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,500
[SPEAKER_02]: That one was pretty fun, too.

660
00:44:32,201 --> 00:44:32,421
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

661
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:34,162
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

662
00:44:55,414 --> 00:45:18,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's the comment you always see anytime Sega gets brought up by SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelongeradio.com Dear Sega, Shenmue 3 I liked the Shenmue series, so whatever Shenmue was one of those things that was hokey when it came out, but it aged like a fine wine It was great, and Seaman Let's play Lucky Hit Well, how about something else?

663
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:19,191
[SPEAKER_09]: How about something else?

664
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:25,074
[SPEAKER_02]: EA, I know people like to groan and everything, but here's something new to groan about.

665
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:35,139
[SPEAKER_02]: EA is going to be doing a series of games for PC and DS that is going to be off of the For Dummies series of books.

666
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:41,602
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually, for now, download Poker for Dummies on PC off the Pogo download area.

667
00:45:43,523 --> 00:45:44,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in theory, you're supposed to be able to.

668
00:45:44,984 --> 00:45:47,026
[SPEAKER_02]: That means if it's up there.

669
00:45:47,066 --> 00:45:51,649
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also going to be Texas Hold'em, Omaha, Seven Car Stud.

670
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's going to be Solitaire for Dummies, Brain Training for Dummies.

671
00:45:56,874 --> 00:45:57,714
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in October.

672
00:45:57,854 --> 00:45:59,135
[SPEAKER_02]: The Solitaire one's in September.

673
00:45:59,596 --> 00:46:01,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Sudoku for Dummies in November.

674
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:03,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And a whole bunch more.

675
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:05,177
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Braid for dummies?

676
00:46:05,737 --> 00:46:07,618
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I need.

677
00:46:08,279 --> 00:46:08,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm serious.

678
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I want games for smart people.

679
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:17,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Mensa Solitaire.

680
00:46:17,245 --> 00:46:24,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you need to go play those cruel games like I Want to Be the Guy or La Mulana or those types of games that are cruel and unusual.

681
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:27,312
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean like poker and puzzle and stuff games.

682
00:46:27,832 --> 00:46:28,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Mensa Solitaire.

683
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:34,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough, but here's the problem I have with this whole thing.

684
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:39,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it's cute that they have the licensing for dummies, look at the games they're putting out.

685
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:41,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Sudoku, Solitaire, Texas Hold'em.

686
00:46:41,525 --> 00:46:45,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we've got like 50,000 versions of those games across all the consoles already.

687
00:46:45,606 --> 00:46:50,248
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going to make these so special besides the four dummies tagline and the little cartoon guy pointing?

688
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:53,569
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that people are admitting to it.

689
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:54,829
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty funny.

690
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:56,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

691
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:58,219
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru suggests Sonic for dummies.

692
00:46:58,259 --> 00:46:59,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee says dummies for dummies.

693
00:47:14,518 --> 00:47:16,159
[SPEAKER_02]: They have for dummies everything now.

694
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,361
[SPEAKER_02]: They have childbirth for dummies.

695
00:47:18,381 --> 00:47:19,622
[SPEAKER_09]: They have podcasting for dummies.

696
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:21,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess what?

697
00:47:21,904 --> 00:47:22,924
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't need that book.

698
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:26,427
[SPEAKER_09]: We're living examples of the fact that any dummy can podcast.

699
00:47:27,508 --> 00:47:27,948
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

700
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:30,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it took a special kind of dummy.

701
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:32,332
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.

702
00:47:32,492 --> 00:47:36,635
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a special sort of self-depreciating dummy to do it every week.

703
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:42,600
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes a special kind of dummy or dare I say it, idiot to do it for over six years.

704
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's coming up on 300?

705
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Practically every Sunday straight.

706
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, granted, we miss some here and there, but, you know.

707
00:47:49,881 --> 00:47:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

708
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:51,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were a little crooked.

709
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:54,242
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all a little bent here at Orange Lounge Radio.

710
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:55,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, how about release dates for Dummies?

711
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:56,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

712
00:47:57,343 --> 00:48:07,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this week, I hope you like Madden because that's coming out on everything, including God knows why, the original Xbox.

713
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Sinkin' Island Sinkin' Island

714
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,005
[SPEAKER_02]: The island sinks!

715
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, spoiler alert!

716
00:48:38,806 --> 00:48:41,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the ship crashes into an iceberg.

717
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:44,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jack dies, oh my god.

718
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:44,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad you asked.

719
00:48:45,488 --> 00:48:51,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Sinking Island is about Walter Jones, a billionaire, who is found dead at the bottom of a huge art building.

720
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:53,110
[SPEAKER_10]: A billionaire and his wife.

721
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, this sounds a lot like Bioshock.

722
00:48:55,612 --> 00:49:03,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Found dead at the bottom of a huge Art Deco tower that he had built as a magnificent getaway on a tropical island.

723
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:11,107
[SPEAKER_10]: There are ten suspects who all have a motive for Mr. Jones' untimely death, as Inspector Jack Norm

724
00:49:11,787 --> 00:49:19,453
[SPEAKER_10]: 3 days before the island disappears and sinks into the ocean to find the truth behind this mysterious death and catch the killer

725
00:49:34,785 --> 00:49:36,725
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope the island does sink and you're on it.

726
00:49:37,026 --> 00:49:44,087
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's not amazing enough for you, then maybe the Cheetah Girls Passport to Stardom on the DS would be your type of game.

727
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:45,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Best week ever!

728
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:46,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

729
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's actually a game that might not be so bad.

730
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:50,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Space Siege is coming out on the PC.

731
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, Space Age?

732
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:54,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Space Siege, like Dungeon Siege.

733
00:49:54,629 --> 00:49:56,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking Space Ace in my mind for some reason.

734
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully there will not be a movie being made for this.

735
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Also this week, Imagine Teacher

736
00:50:04,824 --> 00:50:06,826
[SPEAKER_10]: for you to teach your Imagine Babies.

737
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:07,226
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

738
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:09,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Imagine Teacher.

739
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:10,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine Teacher.

740
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:11,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a teacher, kind of.

741
00:50:11,931 --> 00:50:12,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I teach adults.

742
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,173
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my day job.

743
00:50:14,193 --> 00:50:18,097
[SPEAKER_10]: This game, you actually have to create lesson plans and stuff like that.

744
00:50:18,237 --> 00:50:19,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of curious about this game.

745
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:26,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Silent Hunter 4, the Gold Edition is coming out on PC as well.

746
00:50:27,766 --> 00:50:30,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Ford Racing Off-Road, also for the PC.

747
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And... Oh, did I forget to mention?

748
00:50:35,152 --> 00:50:37,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Madden the 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition.

749
00:50:37,995 --> 00:50:39,936
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a whole bunch of Madden and a whole bunch of...

750
00:50:41,117 --> 00:50:48,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry, and I think I didn't see it on the list, but I think I thought Line Rider 2 was supposed to be coming out this week.

751
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:54,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, judging that I don't see it on this list anymore, it might have been delayed.

752
00:50:55,803 --> 00:51:05,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to check out Madden, but you don't feel like shelling out that kind of money, you could probably find Madden 05 or Madden 04 for about $2 this week at certain closeout sales.

753
00:51:05,747 --> 00:51:07,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we've got, I want to say, 900 copies of Madden 05.

754
00:51:10,822 --> 00:51:11,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

755
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:12,944
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll sell them cheap.

756
00:51:13,544 --> 00:51:15,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you melt them down in a landfill or something like that?

757
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:17,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I've told them to throw them away.

758
00:51:18,569 --> 00:51:20,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's travel over to Japan and Asia in general.

759
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:22,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes we cover the Asian release dates as well.

760
00:51:23,192 --> 00:51:27,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Madden NFL 09 will come out in Asia as well the same day it comes out here in the U.S.

761
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:33,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, Tales of Vesperia, the Japanese version, also makes its way to other Asian regions this week.

762
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:36,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, in Japan itself, nothing on the Xbox 360 this week.

763
00:51:37,525 --> 00:51:38,425
[SPEAKER_09]: How about on the PlayStation 3?

764
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:39,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Same story.

765
00:51:39,987 --> 00:51:40,827
[SPEAKER_09]: There's really nothing new.

766
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,271
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to wait until the 21st when Vampire Reign comes out for something new.

767
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:49,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to the Wii, nothing there either.

768
00:51:50,496 --> 00:51:52,298
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very slow week in Japan.

769
00:51:52,858 --> 00:51:56,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess just not a lot of demand.

770
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:58,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think they're all importing Madden, or what the hell's going on?

771
00:51:59,437 --> 00:52:01,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

772
00:52:23,984 --> 00:52:32,291
[SPEAKER_09]: This could be DarkSakura if she had blonde hair and disproportionate sized boobies and one eye strangely larger than the other.

773
00:52:35,173 --> 00:52:38,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I wish you sat on cam because that was really funny.

774
00:52:38,296 --> 00:52:39,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had blonde hair before.

775
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:40,498
[SPEAKER_09]: It sucks.

776
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:41,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

777
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:42,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see that.

778
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,821
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen me with blonde bangs.

779
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:45,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I have seen you in blonde hair.

780
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not look good at all.

781
00:52:47,021 --> 00:52:47,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

782
00:52:48,402 --> 00:52:49,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fair enough.

783
00:52:50,064 --> 00:52:54,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out on the Nintendo DS, a game called I'm sorry, it's not a game, it's an accessory.

784
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:59,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Accessories for your DS to make it look like Stitch from Leo and Stitch or Jack Skellington.

785
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:00,294
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks kind of cool.

786
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:02,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Poo from Winnie the Pooh.

787
00:53:02,977 --> 00:53:03,877
[SPEAKER_09]: You can check those out.

788
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:06,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise on the DS, there's no games coming out this week.

789
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,701
[SPEAKER_09]: You can make it look like poo.

790
00:53:08,462 --> 00:53:09,923
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a really slow week.

791
00:53:10,303 --> 00:53:14,744
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PSP, Crazy Taxi Double Punch, which I thought we talked about last week.

792
00:53:14,784 --> 00:53:15,504
[SPEAKER_09]: It must have gotten delayed.

793
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:21,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Memories of Sword of Kata is coming out on the PSP from Cyberfront.

794
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:26,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks to be another game starring Anime Girls.

795
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:32,434
[SPEAKER_09]: StrongBad's Cool Game for Attractive People Episode 1, Homestar Ruiner on PC and Wii

796
00:53:50,327 --> 00:54:01,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Fable 2 Pub Games on Xbox 360, Ferrari Challenge on Wii, Madden NFL 2009 on Xbox 360 and Wii, Puzzler Collection on Wii, and Table Football on Wii.

797
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:05,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's a Wii-tastic week.

798
00:54:05,726 --> 00:54:06,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Madden.

799
00:54:06,807 --> 00:54:09,510
[SPEAKER_02]: All I've been hearing about that is Madden since my husband has to work the launch.

800
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:11,340
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

801
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:29,409
[SPEAKER_02]: You know my calendar, I have the Freakonomics calendar.

802
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:40,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually stated why they wanted it specifically to be August 8th, 2008 to have the Olympics open is because eight's a lucky number in China.

803
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:43,051
[SPEAKER_09]: For both And that and women swimming

804
00:55:11,582 --> 00:55:14,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Is women's volleyball still got the same outfits they had four years ago?

805
00:55:15,363 --> 00:55:15,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

806
00:55:15,723 --> 00:55:19,924
[SPEAKER_10]: All those women are kind of like female gym teachers anyways, and no thanks.

807
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:21,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

808
00:55:21,664 --> 00:55:31,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, though, I actually have to crack up because I want to see if anyone makes the same mistake that the target shoot guy did last year.

809
00:55:31,466 --> 00:55:36,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And to hit the target beyond his target, that's pretty awesome.

810
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:38,708
[SPEAKER_02]: However, he did not hit his target.

811
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:42,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Geena Davis going to be doing archery this year?

812
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,281
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want to know.

813
00:55:44,702 --> 00:55:46,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Thelma is an archer.

814
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:49,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget it.

815
00:55:49,986 --> 00:55:54,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say my favorite events are the ninjutsu events.

816
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,610
[SPEAKER_10]: The what?

817
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:56,931
[SPEAKER_10]: The ninjutsu events.

818
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:58,012
[SPEAKER_10]: They have ninja events?

819
00:55:58,673 --> 00:55:59,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I like fencing.

820
00:55:59,513 --> 00:56:00,434
[SPEAKER_09]: You never see them.

821
00:56:01,415 --> 00:56:02,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

822
00:56:02,515 --> 00:56:03,356
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes curling.

823
00:56:03,596 --> 00:56:05,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Curling is awesome.

824
00:56:05,858 --> 00:56:07,019
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the best part of DECA sports.

825
00:56:07,399 --> 00:56:09,040
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the best part of the summer event.

826
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:10,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

827
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:11,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaming news.

828
00:56:13,894 --> 00:56:14,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Fable 2.

829
00:56:15,215 --> 00:56:18,978
[SPEAKER_10]: They've made the announcement that it's coming out October 21st in the US.

830
00:56:19,399 --> 00:56:20,740
[SPEAKER_10]: October 24th in Europe.

831
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:38,555
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, along with that, you're going to be getting the Fable 2 Collector's Edition, which includes some, I guess they're like tarot cards, a bonus DVD with some behind-the-scenes stuff, also a little figurine,

832
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:48,445
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you pre-order your games now, as Jamie mentioned, the Xbox Live Arcade Pub Games will be available starting August 13th.

833
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:57,995
[SPEAKER_10]: One other cool thing, though, that you get with the limited edition is Master Chief, created in Fable 2.

834
00:56:58,095 --> 00:57:00,577
[SPEAKER_10]: As opposed to Master Chef.

835
00:57:00,597 --> 00:57:01,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Using the character creator.

836
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

837
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:05,631
[SPEAKER_09]: I suppose.

838
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,611
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

839
00:57:07,252 --> 00:57:08,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Although he looked a little weird.

840
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:13,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's kind of like taking a character that looks kind of like him and calling him Master Chief.

841
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:14,735
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird.

842
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:21,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they had something like this that they did during a demonstration at E3 where they created a character like this and I guess they kind of tweaked it a little bit more.

843
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:23,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

844
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:23,838
[SPEAKER_10]: It's neat.

845
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:24,719
[SPEAKER_10]: He has a lot of belts.

846
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:26,359
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of belts.

847
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:28,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

848
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm getting the limited edition because I like crap like that

849
00:57:36,825 --> 00:57:37,125
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

850
00:57:37,205 --> 00:57:41,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize in advance if I'm horribly mispronouncing the name of this thing.

851
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,332
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Onichambara?

852
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:44,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what that's called?

853
00:57:44,534 --> 00:57:44,874
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

854
00:57:45,074 --> 00:57:45,635
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

855
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:46,696
[SPEAKER_09]: My Japanese is getting better.

856
00:57:47,016 --> 00:57:48,938
[SPEAKER_09]: But just disregard that.

857
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,561
[SPEAKER_09]: You might want to know this game as Bikini Samurai Squad.

858
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:52,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still Onichambara.

859
00:57:52,823 --> 00:57:53,804
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a subtitle.

860
00:57:54,901 --> 00:58:01,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, but look, it's chicks, and speaking of women's volleyball outfits, it's chicks in bikinis wielding swords.

861
00:58:01,665 --> 00:58:04,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, hello, do you need anything more in a video game?

862
00:58:04,587 --> 00:58:06,128
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing this game is missing is zombies.

863
00:58:06,288 --> 00:58:07,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wait, I think they have those too.

864
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:09,670
[SPEAKER_09]: They're battling a zombie horde.

865
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, do games get any better?

866
00:58:11,411 --> 00:58:11,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I think not.

867
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:15,673
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a chick wearing lingerie with a cowboy hat.

868
00:58:15,713 --> 00:58:16,734
[SPEAKER_10]: You forgot the cowboy hat.

869
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:17,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my bad.

870
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:19,696
[SPEAKER_10]: And she has a samurai sword killing zombies.

871
00:58:20,256 --> 00:58:20,776
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

872
00:58:35,799 --> 00:58:37,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God it's finally here.

873
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It is coming out over here.

874
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:41,423
[SPEAKER_09]: D3 Publisher is going to port the game to the U.S.

875
00:58:42,383 --> 00:58:50,048
[SPEAKER_09]: in hopes that people everywhere will bow down to women with swords and bikinis slashing zombies.

876
00:58:50,449 --> 00:58:51,770
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, sound like your kind of game?

877
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

878
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it does sound like fun.

879
00:58:54,091 --> 00:58:57,253
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't want it on 360, remember they do have the Wii version coming out as well.

880
00:58:57,473 --> 00:58:58,014
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

881
00:58:59,034 --> 00:58:59,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Wii!

882
00:59:01,516 --> 00:59:07,262
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I almost brought my Wii today to view that game.

883
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:08,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week, though.

884
00:59:08,403 --> 00:59:08,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week.

885
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:09,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Or whenever.

886
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:10,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I must see this game.

887
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:12,968
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we should just have a special playing.

888
00:59:13,308 --> 00:59:14,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And make that our pre-recording.

889
00:59:15,371 --> 00:59:16,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, that might work.

890
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:18,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Get that game imported or whatever you gotta do.

891
00:59:18,894 --> 00:59:19,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's check it out.

892
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:20,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

893
00:59:20,436 --> 00:59:21,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I already have it, yeah.

894
00:59:21,577 --> 00:59:21,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet!

895
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:25,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Other news!

896
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:30,990
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been sitting around speculating about why Final Fantasy XIII is going to be coming out on Xbox 360.

897
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Microsoft has said something.

898
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:40,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, one of their marketers, Albert Penelo, said that it was actually the Xbox 360 sales.

899
00:59:40,594 --> 00:59:41,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I had speculated before.

900
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,218
[SPEAKER_02]: were what would bring Final Fantasy XIII to the system.

901
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:52,163
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that they didn't really make any sort of behind-doors deal.

902
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:57,107
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't offer a lot of money for Squeenix to break their exclusive...

903
00:59:59,689 --> 01:00:02,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Exclusivity contract.

904
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:04,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak today.

905
01:00:04,293 --> 01:00:04,694
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

906
01:00:05,174 --> 01:00:06,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a crap week.

907
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:07,396
[SPEAKER_09]: They offered the market share.

908
01:00:07,596 --> 01:00:09,758
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they offered them.

909
01:00:09,918 --> 01:00:13,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 does have the superior market in the United States.

910
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:18,864
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, they've had more term on it, more sales overall.

911
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:28,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're actually stating right now that that was the specific reason that Square said, you know what, let's just do it.

912
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:31,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it out on the 360 in the US.

913
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:36,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also are committed to a simultaneous launch for both of them.

914
01:00:37,295 --> 01:00:41,637
[SPEAKER_02]: But their speculation is that it's going to hold up our PS3 release date in the US.

915
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:42,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

916
01:00:43,038 --> 01:00:50,983
[SPEAKER_02]: But, depending on how long they've had this idea forming, they may have already started work on the port.

917
01:00:51,043 --> 01:00:51,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hope so.

918
01:00:51,803 --> 01:00:56,146
[SPEAKER_09]: They swear they haven't, and they're not going to, but you never know.

919
01:00:56,346 --> 01:00:59,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the note on there that says they haven't begun work on the 360 version yet.

920
01:00:59,988 --> 01:01:00,909
[SPEAKER_09]: But it could be a lie.

921
01:01:01,509 --> 01:01:02,049
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

922
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:02,950
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be a lie.

923
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:04,851
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to tell us the truth.

924
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,133
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

925
01:01:20,158 --> 01:01:30,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that they... What they do when they start programming these games is just... You're not going to have, oh, we are going to do everything on this dev kit.

926
01:01:30,682 --> 01:01:34,644
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're going to start your textures in whatever your 3D program is.

927
01:01:34,664 --> 01:01:38,605
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to start laying out your scripts and other programs.

928
01:01:38,665 --> 01:01:43,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to come together on a PC or Mac or something.

929
01:01:44,187 --> 01:01:45,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they do it in Linux, I don't know.

930
01:01:46,468 --> 01:01:58,012
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, whatever way, they have to come through it on some sort of computer to get everything together, and then it's made compatible with the hardware given.

931
01:01:58,152 --> 01:02:08,915
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's not going to be that difficult, especially since we've seen plenty of ports from one system to the other that didn't lose all that much.

932
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:09,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

933
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:11,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get some comments from chat.

934
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:15,018
[SPEAKER_09]: JV Mon says, I don't mind Final Fantasy XIII being delayed if it means I get it on the 360.

935
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:20,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Kel Tipo says, Final Fantasy XIII seems so far off at this point, another delay doesn't seem so bad.

936
01:02:21,202 --> 01:02:22,063
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of how I feel.

937
01:02:22,183 --> 01:02:28,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's that little spark way off in the distance that, you know, I'm kind of not expecting to see this game before Christmas next year anyway.

938
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:29,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you have it.

939
01:02:29,908 --> 01:02:35,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night as we tape on AllGames.com as we always do.

940
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,213
[SPEAKER_09]: 6 o'clock Pacific time on Sunday nights, except for next week.

941
01:02:38,593 --> 01:02:39,454
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

942
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:55,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

943
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:58,652
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got the classic game of the week coming up in just a couple more stories in our break.

944
01:02:58,932 --> 01:02:59,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.

945
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:00,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And then part B, Loki.

946
01:03:01,293 --> 01:03:03,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Besides, I have one question for you.

947
01:03:03,994 --> 01:03:06,495
[SPEAKER_10]: What is better than Final Fantasy XIII?

948
01:03:06,976 --> 01:03:08,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll answer that with another question.

949
01:03:09,317 --> 01:03:10,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

950
01:03:11,098 --> 01:03:13,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn straight, that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

951
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:14,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Game of the year right there.

952
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:16,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Will it have Death Foxworthy?

953
01:03:17,241 --> 01:03:19,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it will have CG Death Foxworthy.

954
01:03:19,422 --> 01:03:20,602
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like a zombie, by the way.

955
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:21,102
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

956
01:03:21,323 --> 01:03:22,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Can a fifth grader beat Braid?

957
01:03:22,983 --> 01:03:23,844
[SPEAKER_09]: If so, I'm in trouble.

958
01:03:25,422 --> 01:03:27,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, maybe.

959
01:03:27,924 --> 01:03:32,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this going to be one of their massively online games they were teasing at E3, like 1 versus 100?

960
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:36,492
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm going to guess this is going to be a crappy port of the Wii game that's coming out.

961
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:41,196
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is being put out by THQ, which I do think they are putting out the crappy game.

962
01:03:42,317 --> 01:03:48,382
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it should be coming out sometime after all the cool games come out on Xbox Live Arcade this month.

963
01:03:48,642 --> 01:03:50,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well.

964
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:53,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, wait, it's Xbox Live Arcade?

965
01:03:54,558 --> 01:03:55,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox Live Arcade.

966
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's kind of interesting, I guess.

967
01:03:58,282 --> 01:04:01,285
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can embarrass myself and my friends online with what I don't know.

968
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:02,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

969
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:10,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Although usually I seem to watch the show and I seem to do okay on the show, but sometimes there's like a world history question that I just don't get because history was never my strong subject.

970
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, he's just creepy looking, man.

971
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:19,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, it's like, if you get this question wrong, I'm gonna jump through the TV and eat your brain.

972
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:20,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how small his head is!

973
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,932
[SPEAKER_02]: His head's shaped like a cantaloupe.

974
01:04:24,834 --> 01:04:26,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna show the chatroom what his head looks like, okay?

975
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:31,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at his head!

976
01:04:33,187 --> 01:04:36,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Tetsuya says, bye, give me the mole on Xbox Live Arcade.

977
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:39,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Reality games on Xbox Live Arcade, I don't think that could happen, though.

978
01:04:39,773 --> 01:04:42,875
[SPEAKER_09]: They're too psychological intensive.

979
01:04:42,955 --> 01:04:49,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, speaking of Xbox Live Arcade games, we've been talking a lot, a lot, a lot about Braid tonight, as a lot of people have been talking about Braid.

980
01:04:49,341 --> 01:04:53,784
[SPEAKER_09]: What's very interesting, though, have you checked out the official walkthrough for Braid?

981
01:04:54,505 --> 01:04:57,347
[SPEAKER_09]: The creator, Jonathan Blow, actually put up an official walkthrough for Braid.

982
01:04:57,387 --> 01:04:58,749
[SPEAKER_09]: It's available at braid-game.com.

983
01:04:59,389 --> 01:05:00,390
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

984
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:32,402
[SPEAKER_09]: solve the puzzles yourself and stop using a walkthrough you stupid dork all the puzzles in Braid are reasonable if you're having problems solving a puzzle don't give up please do not use a walkthrough don't give up thank you for your time

985
01:05:34,028 --> 01:06:01,340
[SPEAKER_09]: and yet might I point out the irony that currently this game is sitting at number 3 on the most requested FAQs on GameFAQs probably from people feeling as dumb as me however I will say though there are rewards to be got from this game like any game from not using a walkthrough that's not going to stop some people that want to know the story and there is going to come a point where I'm just not going to be able to freaking resist but I do like the little trick played on us by the official developers I thought it was cute if nothing else

986
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,243
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was something I found, by the way, on Major Nelson's Twitter, which you were saying earlier in the show.

987
01:06:05,723 --> 01:06:07,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been putting that to major use.

988
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:11,307
[SPEAKER_02]: That and there's some pretty funny stuff that he posts every so often.

989
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,070
[SPEAKER_09]: You should also add on the Xbox staff, Trixie's there.

990
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:17,372
[SPEAKER_09]: She posts a lot more random stuff, but she's a good read, too.

991
01:06:17,572 --> 01:06:19,434
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of great gaming people on Twitter.

992
01:06:19,494 --> 01:06:21,455
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the place where everybody's at right now.

993
01:06:21,535 --> 01:06:23,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Twitterific on my iPhone.

994
01:06:23,797 --> 01:06:26,459
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many other indie game podcasters I'm following on Twitter.

995
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:28,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Godfrey, GamerEaty, Bobby.

996
01:06:29,162 --> 01:06:30,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Off the top of my head.

997
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:33,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on top of that, there's other famous individuals on it.

998
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:34,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Will Wheaton has a Twitter.

999
01:06:35,467 --> 01:06:36,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been reading that.

1000
01:06:36,147 --> 01:06:38,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, Obama is following me.

1001
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,471
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's how I found his Twitter.

1002
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:41,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1003
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:46,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, I'm not even anything on there that says anything about being Democrat.

1004
01:06:46,296 --> 01:06:47,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a libertarian.

1005
01:06:48,918 --> 01:06:49,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm voting for him.

1006
01:06:49,919 --> 01:06:50,139
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1007
01:06:51,864 --> 01:06:53,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Danger, danger, political discussion, danger.

1008
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:54,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's all right.

1009
01:06:54,826 --> 01:06:56,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say who I'm voting for.

1010
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,807
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine, that's fine.

1011
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:57,388
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1012
01:06:58,368 --> 01:07:07,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into other topics, though, like your vote for the classic game of the week that all the kids should be playing this week because every week you like to pick a game from the archives.

1013
01:07:08,255 --> 01:07:12,177
[SPEAKER_09]: And this week, as I understand it, we have a nice change of pace.

1014
01:07:12,718 --> 01:07:14,199
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Sega-related this week.

1015
01:07:14,859 --> 01:07:15,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of.

1016
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:16,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just messing with you.

1017
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,642
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here it is, folks, your classic game of the week.

1018
01:07:19,912 --> 01:07:23,757
[SPEAKER_09]: What should the kiddies be dusting off and playing this week?

1019
01:07:24,077 --> 01:07:27,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this also wins the About Damn Time award, too.

1020
01:07:27,682 --> 01:07:29,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the game that I picked is Tempest 2000.

1021
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:31,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1022
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:35,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Tempest 2000 is one of the only good games on the Atari Jaguar.

1023
01:07:36,081 --> 01:07:40,123
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the only Atari Jaguar game that I have ever used in this segment.

1024
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:43,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually referring to the Sega Saturn version, which is the one that I have.

1025
01:07:44,526 --> 01:07:47,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So, screw a bunch of the Atari Jaguar.

1026
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:52,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I have played this on the Jaguar, believe it or not, and I endorse it on the Jaguar.

1027
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:53,090
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good time.

1028
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:53,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to play the music.

1029
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:56,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take a listen to some of the hot techno music in the game.

1030
01:08:03,322 --> 01:08:03,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember this?

1031
01:08:05,223 --> 01:08:08,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Zapper Recharge.

1032
01:08:09,445 --> 01:08:09,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1033
01:08:10,726 --> 01:08:11,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1034
01:08:11,186 --> 01:08:12,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, tell us a little more about Tempest 2000.

1035
01:08:13,207 --> 01:08:19,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if anyone's ever played the original Tempest, it was a vector game that was put out by Atari.

1036
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:46,997
[SPEAKER_02]: where you go on a series of different shaped fields and you can only move left or right for yourself but you'll have like ones that look like a V or some that look like a giant octagon or the first stage is basically a straight plane but this one other than just shooting the little ships as they approach your ship on this plane you have other little goodies added

1037
01:08:48,738 --> 01:08:50,719
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have spikes that come up.

1038
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:53,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the spikes were in the original, too.

1039
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:55,961
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to shoot the spikes all the way back down to the bottom.

1040
01:08:57,522 --> 01:09:01,083
[SPEAKER_02]: If the enemy ship gets up to the top of the plane, they can catch you.

1041
01:09:01,564 --> 01:09:08,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what they've added to this one is you get a particle laser so that you can shoot faster and more energy.

1042
01:09:08,927 --> 01:09:10,767
[SPEAKER_02]: You can gain points.

1043
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:16,091
[SPEAKER_02]: for bonus ships and stuff.

1044
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a jump power-up, so you can jump over the enemies when they're on the top line.

1045
01:09:20,674 --> 01:09:25,318
[SPEAKER_02]: An AI droid, which is just this little vector cube that follows you around and shoots.

1046
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:34,725
[SPEAKER_09]: A warp token, so you can... Wait, wait, wait, we have to listen to this part.

1047
01:09:35,025 --> 01:09:37,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this version does have the voice, did it?

1048
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:38,427
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it says it really quietly.

1049
01:09:38,447 --> 01:09:40,069
[SPEAKER_02]: The Super Zapper recharges it on the...

1050
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:42,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Zapper Recharge is the best part.

1051
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we get to see the bonus stage in this clip?

1052
01:09:43,932 --> 01:09:46,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that part of the game always tripped me out.

1053
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:47,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's alright.

1054
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:08,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the weird ambient music too.

1055
01:10:08,143 --> 01:10:10,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me turn it down a little bit because those gunshots are getting a little annoying.

1056
01:10:10,525 --> 01:10:11,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, go ahead.

1057
01:10:11,285 --> 01:10:12,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1058
01:10:12,566 --> 01:10:19,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also, as you go through, you can get warp tokens to travel to different stages.

1059
01:10:20,193 --> 01:10:29,200
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also get a power-up to destroy all of the enemies that are on the screen and move you to the next level.

1060
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Outta Here.

1061
01:10:31,877 --> 01:10:39,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You get one that, well, the female voice in there goes, yes, yes, yes, when you get this power-up.

1062
01:10:40,664 --> 01:10:43,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get it when you're warping off a completed one.

1063
01:10:44,067 --> 01:10:52,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you start your next level, the first power-up that you get is an AI droid.

1064
01:10:52,914 --> 01:10:59,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, yes, yes, yes, but in that really high-pitched sort of, oh, baby way.

1065
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Eat electric death.

1066
01:11:02,006 --> 01:11:02,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.

1067
01:11:02,628 --> 01:11:07,718
[SPEAKER_02]: When you use your giant zapper thing, it says, eat electric death.

1068
01:11:07,738 --> 01:11:08,920
[SPEAKER_09]: It just happened in the clip here.

1069
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:09,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Eat electric death.

1070
01:11:10,002 --> 01:11:10,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Caught you.

1071
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:11,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Guy died.

1072
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,520
[SPEAKER_02]: and when it says catchy, it goes, whoa!

1073
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:21,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've also got other versions, like this particular music that we're playing here is like I said, the Sega Saturn version.

1074
01:11:22,502 --> 01:11:25,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It did first come out on Atari Jaguar.

1075
01:11:26,443 --> 01:11:30,364
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a PlayStation version that's called Tempest X3.

1076
01:11:32,604 --> 01:11:40,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be updated graphics and music, but it's, I don't, actually I don't think it's as much fun

1077
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:50,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, however, if you are, if you put, in all caps, Y-I-F-F exclamation point on the high score table, you get to play the original Tempest 2000.

1078
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:51,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1079
01:11:51,531 --> 01:11:53,772
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't save any of your high scores, so that's kind of sad.

1080
01:11:54,232 --> 01:11:55,453
[SPEAKER_09]: They also have this on PC, right?

1081
01:11:55,573 --> 01:11:58,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there's a PC version, which I've got it somewhere.

1082
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:01,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's also, um...

1083
01:12:04,588 --> 01:12:05,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Giraffe Space Giraffe

1084
01:12:21,429 --> 01:12:24,231
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of funny, like it had its moments, it was really funny.

1085
01:12:24,652 --> 01:12:27,974
[SPEAKER_09]: But the problem I had with it is that graphically the game was ruined.

1086
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:31,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how graphics can single-handedly ruin a game.

1087
01:12:32,077 --> 01:12:36,601
[SPEAKER_09]: And the same problem I had with Tempest on Xbox Live Arcade.

1088
01:12:37,121 --> 01:12:40,104
[SPEAKER_09]: They remade the original Tempest, did this whole remake of the original Tempest.

1089
01:12:40,384 --> 01:12:42,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It was missing that... There's a Tempest 3000.

1090
01:12:42,946 --> 01:12:49,231
[SPEAKER_09]: There's that X factor I can't put my finger on that Tempest 2000 had that the Tempest on Xbox Live Arcade most definitely doesn't have.

1091
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:55,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have to tell you one thing, though, that I do really like about the PlayStation version, Tempest X3, is it used the NegCon.

1092
01:12:57,276 --> 01:13:05,742
[SPEAKER_02]: The NegCon for the uninitiated is, it's a Namco controller that you, it's separate in the center so it twists.

1093
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:09,205
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made for Wipeout and other racing games.

1094
01:13:09,305 --> 01:13:10,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I have four of them.

1095
01:13:10,566 --> 01:13:11,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1096
01:13:11,907 --> 01:13:15,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me forever to find them, but I have two Japanese ones and two American ones.

1097
01:13:15,789 --> 01:13:29,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, um, the other thing, um, that I think is interesting is that anyone likes the music in this one, um, it was actually done by Imagine Design, which is now Brilliant Development, and they did the music for Jaguar games Alien vs. Predator and Battlemorph.

1098
01:13:30,817 --> 01:13:35,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and I do recall Alien vs. Predator actually having some pretty sweet music.

1099
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:42,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can also use the Jaguar's rotary controller on this, too, so you can get your sort of unschooled.

1100
01:13:43,163 --> 01:13:44,004
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we say about the Jaguar?

1101
01:13:44,024 --> 01:13:44,264
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked!

1102
01:14:04,724 --> 01:14:06,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what, I take that back.

1103
01:14:07,186 --> 01:14:13,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there were other, there were, there was another couple of good games, but I think they were also remade, original games too.

1104
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:15,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, anything that was on the Jaguar, it was good, it was probably remade.

1105
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:20,895
[SPEAKER_02]: But at any rate, there have been people who actually went out and made a rotary controller.

1106
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:24,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can find them online somewhere.

1107
01:14:24,997 --> 01:14:28,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have modified old 2600 controllers and they're doing them too.

1108
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:34,663
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, it was designed by Jeff Minter.

1109
01:14:36,383 --> 01:14:42,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say go check out some of his other contributions too, even though he did give us Space Giraffe.

1110
01:14:43,766 --> 01:14:45,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so that's it then.

1111
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:47,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Tempest 2000, Classic Game of the Week.

1112
01:14:47,128 --> 01:14:50,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really just trying to talk a whole lot so you could keep your music playing because I like your music.

1113
01:14:50,889 --> 01:14:52,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the clip's about up, so there you have it.

1114
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Your Classic Game of the Week, Tempest 2000.

1115
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:56,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Favorite thing about the game in a nutshell?

1116
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:58,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

1117
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,240
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a favorite thing.

1118
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the entire package.

1119
01:15:02,641 --> 01:15:04,041
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the whole thing is one.

1120
01:15:04,681 --> 01:15:05,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

1121
01:15:05,261 --> 01:15:06,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I will accept that answer.

1122
01:15:06,662 --> 01:15:11,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's going to do it for our Classic Game of the Week and for Part A here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1123
01:15:11,383 --> 01:15:12,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay tuned, guys.

1124
01:15:12,184 --> 01:15:16,745
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be right back after a quick free break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1125
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:26,405
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a couple of other things I just tell you when I remember.

1126
01:15:27,226 --> 01:15:28,267
[SPEAKER_11]: He's crazy.

1127
01:15:28,507 --> 01:15:34,474
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could not see the similarities in the personalities within the first couple of episodes, you need brain surgery.

1128
01:15:34,674 --> 01:15:35,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously.

1129
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:35,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Slappy.

1130
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:40,400
[SPEAKER_11]: How?

1131
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,461
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't have to hit me so hard.

1132
01:15:42,481 --> 01:15:43,521
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't that hard.

1133
01:15:43,621 --> 01:15:48,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your hosts DJ Ranma S and Kuro Usagi.

1134
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:54,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Log on to DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.

1135
01:15:55,546 --> 01:15:58,167
[SPEAKER_09]: How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?

1136
01:16:00,548 --> 01:16:01,728
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have a rape carnival.

1137
01:16:04,129 --> 01:16:06,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell them to rape things because rape is funny.

1138
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Walk around the neighborhood and rape cats in your neighborhood.

1139
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:12,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold a plastic knife.

1140
01:16:12,555 --> 01:16:13,476
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a plastic knife.

1141
01:16:14,456 --> 01:16:15,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And take pictures.

1142
01:16:17,379 --> 01:16:19,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, rape isn't funny.

1143
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless if it's clown rape.

1144
01:16:28,775 --> 01:16:30,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Rape of people is not funny.

1145
01:16:30,237 --> 01:16:32,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Rape of monsters is funny.

1146
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Because monsters are bad.

1147
01:16:35,442 --> 01:16:36,944
[SPEAKER_09]: And when bad people... What?

1148
01:16:37,044 --> 01:16:39,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not going to keep going down this line.

1149
01:16:39,566 --> 01:16:40,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm digging myself a hole.

1150
01:16:40,567 --> 01:16:42,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1151
01:16:42,289 --> 01:16:45,573
[SPEAKER_09]: The video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.

1152
01:16:45,933 --> 01:16:49,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.

1153
01:16:50,256 --> 01:16:55,781
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.

1154
01:16:56,081 --> 01:16:57,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, except that asshole.

1155
01:16:58,483 --> 01:17:00,745
[SPEAKER_08]: And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1156
01:17:01,445 --> 01:17:10,412
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.

1157
01:17:11,973 --> 01:17:13,294
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't even fucking make sense.

1158
01:17:13,455 --> 01:17:15,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1159
01:17:15,794 --> 01:17:19,077
[SPEAKER_09]: August the 10th, 2008 is the night we are taping live.

1160
01:17:19,157 --> 01:17:22,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself, Rob Roberts, joining me as always, DarkSakura, Loki.

1161
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:22,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi!

1162
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Back for more gaming news after feeling a little full.

1163
01:17:26,882 --> 01:17:33,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I had some pretzels to snack on during the break there and some vitamin water to refresh me now, even though they say this stuff is really not as good for you as you'd think.

1164
01:17:34,368 --> 01:17:35,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm full of energy.

1165
01:17:35,308 --> 01:17:36,009
[SPEAKER_09]: It's better than soda.

1166
01:17:36,089 --> 01:17:36,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Good!

1167
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:37,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of energy.

1168
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:38,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of energy to get through gaming news?

1169
01:17:39,371 --> 01:17:39,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

1170
01:17:39,872 --> 01:17:40,592
[SPEAKER_09]: How about you, Loki?

1171
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:41,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you energetic?

1172
01:17:43,984 --> 01:17:44,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess not.

1173
01:17:44,644 --> 01:17:46,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you mind doing some gaming news for us anyway?

1174
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:46,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1175
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:47,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, sure.

1176
01:17:48,405 --> 01:18:02,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it's already been rumored that it's coming out at some point, but Guitar Hero Metallica was pretty much confirmed by Metallica themselves during an interview with Lars Orch.

1177
01:18:03,548 --> 01:18:10,409
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically, the quote is, if somebody's going to follow up Guitar Hero Aerosmith, we're talking...

1178
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:18,623
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking and it's exciting and the people at Guitar Hero and Activision are rapidly becoming our best new friends in the world.

1179
01:18:19,124 --> 01:18:20,746
[SPEAKER_10]: You can put the rest of it together yourself.

1180
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:22,991
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah.

1181
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:28,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar Hero, Metallica, once again, horning up the franchise next year.

1182
01:18:29,494 --> 01:18:33,496
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's going to be a lot of people that are going to buy this game, even more so than Aerosmith, I predict.

1183
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:33,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, probably.

1184
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:38,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Aerosmith's a pretty rockin' band, don't get me wrong, but Metallica's even, like, more so.

1185
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Metallica is godly.

1186
01:18:40,999 --> 01:18:45,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Even after the backlash of Napster and all that, you know, we've kind of forgotten about that.

1187
01:18:45,341 --> 01:18:46,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a really good light-satinger.

1188
01:18:47,816 --> 01:18:51,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I one of the few people on the planet that actually liked Reload and Load, those albums?

1189
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:52,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I loved it.

1190
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:53,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought those albums were pretty good.

1191
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:57,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the best part of those albums was the fact that Marianne Faithfull was on a song.

1192
01:18:57,782 --> 01:18:58,642
[SPEAKER_09]: That was so rad.

1193
01:18:58,882 --> 01:19:02,524
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing ever tops the awesome that was the S&M concert.

1194
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, was that the orchestra?

1195
01:19:05,706 --> 01:19:11,209
[SPEAKER_02]: The one with Cayman and the, what was it, Berklee, I think?

1196
01:19:11,489 --> 01:19:13,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was local, from where they're from.

1197
01:19:14,312 --> 01:19:18,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it was funny that people who bought season passes for theater and opera had to listen to Metallica.

1198
01:19:19,865 --> 01:19:21,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments from our chatroom, chat.orangelonceradio.com.

1199
01:19:22,046 --> 01:19:25,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, Lars is a big sellout, according to Actdeft.

1200
01:19:25,448 --> 01:19:27,430
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are still some people that are Metallica-hating.

1201
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:32,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Jvmon says, my store still has dozens and dozens of Guitar Hero Aerosmith still in my store.

1202
01:19:32,532 --> 01:19:33,673
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've noticed the same thing.

1203
01:19:33,793 --> 01:19:35,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, any idea?

1204
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:39,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you know anything from the inside, but any idea on how Aerosmith Guitar Hero has been selling?

1205
01:19:41,097 --> 01:19:43,038
[SPEAKER_10]: We sold a lot of it, and then...

1206
01:19:44,755 --> 01:19:45,475
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about it.

1207
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:47,056
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not a lot of reorders.

1208
01:19:47,276 --> 01:19:49,777
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay, isn't that bad, though, when there's not a lot of reorders?

1209
01:19:49,797 --> 01:19:52,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that means the ones that were bought for the shelves aren't leaving.

1210
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:53,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that bad?

1211
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:54,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be.

1212
01:19:54,839 --> 01:19:56,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm not trying to distort the facts or whatever.

1213
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they are selling really good.

1214
01:19:57,801 --> 01:20:01,963
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to look at the MPD numbers at the end of July to see how it did.

1215
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, though, it'll probably still be doing pretty well through July.

1216
01:20:04,524 --> 01:20:08,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the MPD number is in September for August to see how well it's doing.

1217
01:20:09,286 --> 01:20:09,766
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, good.

1218
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:13,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, it sold a lot, but a lot of people were just picking it up

1219
01:20:17,298 --> 01:20:21,782
[SPEAKER_09]: JV Mon continues, Guitar Hero Aerosmith sold really well the first week, then people stopped caring.

1220
01:20:22,543 --> 01:20:25,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I do intend on picking it up, but again, I'm holding out for a price drop.

1221
01:20:25,926 --> 01:20:29,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they're not leaving shelves, maybe that'll happen sooner than people were telling me it was going to.

1222
01:20:29,889 --> 01:20:34,894
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing, too, you have to look at is a lot of people may have already had the guitar bundles for it already.

1223
01:20:35,054 --> 01:20:38,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe people just bought way too many bundles.

1224
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:39,899
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com

1225
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:49,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Say you're in the Guitar Hero and you've had one through three already.

1226
01:20:49,492 --> 01:20:51,033
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably already own a second guitar.

1227
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:54,355
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably don't need a third guitar, so maybe.

1228
01:20:54,675 --> 01:20:57,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And DarkTetsuya says the mandatory in Sky.

1229
01:20:57,877 --> 01:20:59,218
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Guitar Hero Journey?

1230
01:20:59,818 --> 01:21:00,539
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I'm down with that.

1231
01:21:00,579 --> 01:21:01,179
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way.

1232
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:02,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's not going to stop believing.

1233
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you hear?

1234
01:21:03,261 --> 01:21:03,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not stopping believing.

1235
01:21:04,001 --> 01:21:05,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you hear the Journey is going to be in town?

1236
01:21:06,243 --> 01:21:06,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are they?

1237
01:21:06,883 --> 01:21:07,563
[SPEAKER_09]: With heart.

1238
01:21:08,144 --> 01:21:08,344
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1239
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:09,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And cheap trick.

1240
01:21:09,385 --> 01:21:09,625
[SPEAKER_09]: When?

1241
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:11,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Like soon.

1242
01:21:11,926 --> 01:21:12,707
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going, right?

1243
01:21:12,807 --> 01:21:13,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1244
01:21:13,307 --> 01:21:14,768
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be the same weekend as PAX.

1245
01:21:14,848 --> 01:21:15,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to look it up.

1246
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:16,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll find out.

1247
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:18,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll look it up.

1248
01:21:20,435 --> 01:21:21,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll look it up while we read a story.

1249
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:26,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, if there's one thing better than journey, it's heart and journey.

1250
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:27,966
[SPEAKER_02]: It's heart.

1251
01:21:28,867 --> 01:21:29,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

1252
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:32,513
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as I get my power ballads, I'm happy.

1253
01:21:33,544 --> 01:21:35,345
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says Guitar Hero ABBA.

1254
01:21:35,685 --> 01:21:38,126
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's for my dream pop and music game.

1255
01:21:38,246 --> 01:21:40,467
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be like Keyboard Mania.

1256
01:21:41,467 --> 01:21:43,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, sorry, let's move on.

1257
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:44,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, shall we?

1258
01:21:45,148 --> 01:21:48,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Revolution set list was released this week.

1259
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:50,611
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1260
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:11,409
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

1261
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:30,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Queen was Stone Cold Crazy.

1262
01:22:30,857 --> 01:22:31,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that song.

1263
01:22:31,397 --> 01:22:34,519
[SPEAKER_09]: We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister, which, you know, that's the Twisted Sister song.

1264
01:22:34,539 --> 01:22:35,420
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is Butt Rock's version.

1265
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:36,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Kinda, in a way.

1266
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it has Blitzkrieg Bop by the Ramones.

1267
01:22:39,582 --> 01:22:42,503
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one they failed famously on stage at E3.

1268
01:22:43,104 --> 01:22:43,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I Evil?

1269
01:22:45,225 --> 01:22:46,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad Reputation by Joan Jett.

1270
01:22:47,446 --> 01:22:50,448
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to top it off for fun, Sk8er Boi by Avril Lavigne.

1271
01:22:51,624 --> 01:22:52,064
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1272
01:22:52,284 --> 01:22:53,005
[SPEAKER_09]: And Linkin Park.

1273
01:22:54,005 --> 01:22:55,406
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not totally butt rock.

1274
01:22:55,426 --> 01:22:56,086
[SPEAKER_09]: All the small things.

1275
01:22:57,167 --> 01:23:02,289
[SPEAKER_10]: To go back to the non-gaming related stuff we were talking about just earlier.

1276
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:04,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Journey with Heart and Cheap Trick.

1277
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,011
[SPEAKER_10]: You were close.

1278
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:09,893
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the 27th of September.

1279
01:23:11,113 --> 01:23:11,513
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going.

1280
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:11,934
[SPEAKER_10]: We can go.

1281
01:23:12,694 --> 01:23:13,214
[SPEAKER_10]: We are down.

1282
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:16,256
[SPEAKER_10]: It's at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.

1283
01:23:16,276 --> 01:23:16,976
[SPEAKER_12]: Guess what else is.

1284
01:23:17,056 --> 01:23:17,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Mountain View?

1285
01:23:19,597 --> 01:23:26,183
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's one in SAC too, whatever they call it, Sleep Train or SAC Valley, they change the name of it every year.

1286
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:28,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But next month also is Weird Al.

1287
01:23:29,405 --> 01:23:30,026
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

1288
01:23:30,186 --> 01:23:30,706
[SPEAKER_02]: At the fair.

1289
01:23:31,347 --> 01:23:33,309
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've never seen Weird Al live before.

1290
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:34,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You're coming with us.

1291
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:36,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should do OLR live at the Journey concert.

1292
01:23:36,732 --> 01:23:37,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do that!

1293
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:38,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that would be fantastic.

1294
01:23:38,593 --> 01:23:40,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's possible.

1295
01:23:40,254 --> 01:23:41,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find a way.

1296
01:23:41,055 --> 01:23:42,276
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go record in the bathroom.

1297
01:23:42,316 --> 01:23:44,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Concord Pavilion, the 24th.

1298
01:23:44,437 --> 01:23:45,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they're coming to Sleep Train Amphitheater.

1299
01:23:45,978 --> 01:23:46,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Look it up.

1300
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:47,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Look up the Sac Valley thing.

1301
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:48,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll look it up later.

1302
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So, can I do my story?

1303
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:52,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Jamie, just do your story and I will look up Journey and Heart.

1304
01:23:52,606 --> 01:23:58,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not as, you know, didn't go through their massive 80s-tastic mode because Ozzy always rocks.

1305
01:23:59,049 --> 01:24:03,492
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is going to be Ozzy and Guitar Hero World Tour.

1306
01:24:06,033 --> 01:24:08,954
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have some tracks released today.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1324
01:25:07,654 --> 01:25:08,975
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me all pee myself.

1325
01:25:09,035 --> 01:25:09,755
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that song.

1326
01:25:10,055 --> 01:25:10,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Foo Fighters are pretty awesome.

1327
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:11,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Jimi Hendrix songs.

1328
01:25:11,776 --> 01:25:12,636
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me happy.

[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Haze, the live version, Wind Cries Mary, Linkin Park, What Have I Done, Paramore Misery Business, Sublime Santeria.

1330
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:21,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to yawn so bad for that one.

1331
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so over Sublime.

1332
01:25:23,481 --> 01:25:24,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's really overplayed.

1333
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:25,922
[SPEAKER_02]: The Doors, Love Me Two Times.

1334
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:27,382

1336
01:25:32,764 --> 01:25:37,646

1337
01:25:37,807 --> 01:25:39,427
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a fun one.

1338
01:25:40,428 --> 01:25:42,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I love When I Kissed a Teacher by ABBA.

1339
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:45,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

1340
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:48,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you know I've got a present for you from Ranma at my house.

1341
01:25:48,992 --> 01:25:49,352
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

1342
01:25:49,732 --> 01:25:50,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an ABBA album.

1343
01:25:51,073 --> 01:25:51,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1344
01:25:51,553 --> 01:25:51,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Album.

1345
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:53,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Like old art and everything?

1346
01:25:54,014 --> 01:25:54,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1347
01:25:54,454 --> 01:25:56,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can put that in the blank space on Justin.tv.

1348
01:25:56,975 --> 01:25:58,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got you a Bette Midler album.

1349
01:25:58,874 --> 01:26:01,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not as big on Bette Miller, but my mother is, so I'll take that to her.

1350
01:26:01,821 --> 01:26:02,824
[SPEAKER_02]: He got you Super Trooper.

1351
01:26:03,485 --> 01:26:04,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, awesome.

1352
01:26:04,648 --> 01:26:05,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry.

1353
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:05,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1354
01:26:06,371 --> 01:26:28,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge, Abba O It's Abba Lounge Radio Loki, save the show, please Anyways, since we were talking about Rock Band earlier And I mentioned that we were going to be talking about street dates Well, the street dates apparently were leaked out of some database somewhere The dates that they have It wasn't you, was it?

1355
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:34,034
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't me I don't do that sort of thing Anymore

1356
01:26:37,978 --> 01:27:04,557
[SPEAKER_10]: and he doesn't do it any less so according to this database which I think I want to say that it was like Fred Meyer or something like that maybe it was Blockbuster probably Blockbuster the 360 version they have coming out September 24th the PS3 October 19th and the Wii November 18th that is about half true

1357
01:27:09,614 --> 01:27:10,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

1358
01:27:10,874 --> 01:27:12,315
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not entirely correct.

1359
01:27:13,035 --> 01:27:16,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a certain element of that that might be incorrect?

1360
01:27:18,616 --> 01:27:20,536
[SPEAKER_10]: The dates for those systems are correct.

1361
01:27:21,216 --> 01:27:22,857
[SPEAKER_10]: They just don't mention one thing.

1362
01:27:24,037 --> 01:27:31,238
[SPEAKER_10]: In September, the game-only version for Xbox 360 is coming out and the accessories are coming out by themselves.

1363
01:27:31,759 --> 01:27:38,040
[SPEAKER_10]: The bundle's not coming out until the PS3 date, which is the same time the PS3 will be getting the standalone and the bundle.

1364
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,961
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually makes sense if they're rushing the game out.

1365
01:27:41,081 --> 01:27:46,204
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the Wii version is coming out November 18th along with the PlayStation 2 version.

1366
01:27:47,624 --> 01:27:48,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1367
01:27:49,325 --> 01:27:49,865
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you know.

1368
01:27:50,005 --> 01:27:52,787
[SPEAKER_10]: They were close, but not close enough.

1369
01:27:53,707 --> 01:27:55,468
[SPEAKER_10]: They're probably going to give them the game only version.

1370
01:27:56,249 --> 01:27:57,769
[SPEAKER_10]: What about the achievements and trophies in the game?

1371
01:27:58,290 --> 01:28:01,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the achievements and trophies are going to be very similar to the last game.

1372
01:28:02,752 --> 01:28:04,653
[SPEAKER_10]: They have trophies for...

1373
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1374
01:28:35,089 --> 01:28:38,511
[SPEAKER_10]: and then of course they have some drum challenge achievements and stuff like that.

1375
01:28:38,551 --> 01:28:39,891
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks very similar to the first game.

1376
01:28:40,151 --> 01:28:48,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, now that Band Tour is supposed to be online playable, so I can play it with friends of mine and not have to have everybody over, I'll actually be able to unlock some of those achievements.

1377
01:28:48,635 --> 01:28:48,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1378
01:28:49,035 --> 01:28:52,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't have the full thing, so I've never got those achievements, which is sad.

1379
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:56,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm counting on my friend who plays Rock Band a lot more than I do to play my copy and get me the achievements.

1380
01:28:57,059 --> 01:28:57,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll play it with you.

1381
01:28:57,799 --> 01:28:59,920
[SPEAKER_10]: You should come over one day and we'll get all those achievements.

1382
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to get that kick-ass drum set.

1383
01:29:02,601 --> 01:29:03,742
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to learn how to drum.

1384
01:29:03,982 --> 01:29:04,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1385
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:08,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, onto a completely different note.

1386
01:29:08,942 --> 01:29:13,365
[SPEAKER_09]: This has nothing to do with music games whatsoever, although you might say these two are making music together.

1387
01:29:14,146 --> 01:29:17,828
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from a post on these forums, MMORPG.com.

1388
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:32,298
[SPEAKER_09]: They're talking about the game Age of Conan, and this user, I don't know if the user themselves did it, I don't think they did, but they're posting screenshots from the Age of Conan game, where apparently, one of these players, who plays a male character in the game, uh...

1389
01:29:32,898 --> 01:29:34,159
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1390
01:29:54,019 --> 01:29:58,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, unfortunately if we did that, who knows what PSA we would receive next week.

1391
01:29:58,622 --> 01:30:04,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, they posted these screenshots here, and apparently they were cybering a little bit with the GM.

1392
01:30:04,886 --> 01:30:09,249
[SPEAKER_09]: And look, here's some of the quotes from here.

1393
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:14,433
[SPEAKER_09]: The player, with dual-wheeled barbarians though, I mean, two, that's a bit difficult for me to handle.

1394
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:16,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather stick with one big sword.

1395
01:30:16,434 --> 01:30:18,396
[SPEAKER_09]: And the GM says, you like it rough, I take it.

1396
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:21,669
[SPEAKER_09]: The player says, be gentle.

1397
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:24,711
[SPEAKER_09]: The GM says, are you a real woman?

1398
01:30:25,071 --> 01:30:26,392
[SPEAKER_09]: LOL, not crazy question.

1399
01:30:26,412 --> 01:30:27,352
[SPEAKER_09]: You would be surprised.

1400
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,835
[SPEAKER_09]: And the player says, yep, I just play a male character so guys don't flirt with me in game like on WoW.

1401
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:35,176
[SPEAKER_09]: And the GM says, I'm wearing panties.

1402
01:30:35,397 --> 01:30:35,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Joke.

1403
01:30:37,626 --> 01:30:38,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1404
01:31:05,831 --> 01:31:07,793
[SPEAKER_09]: The GM ends up saying, hmm, you are bad.

1405
01:31:07,853 --> 01:31:11,156
[SPEAKER_09]: What if I rip your panties off and fuck you hard until I'm satisfied?

1406
01:31:12,597 --> 01:31:17,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Want to feel you get really... Wait, want to feel... This is, of course, cyber chat, so the grammar is all horrible.

1407
01:31:18,502 --> 01:31:28,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Want to feel you get really wee so I can put it just the head of my you-know-what inside you and use my hand to slowly move it around before plunging it fully into you and making you take it all.

1408
01:31:28,892 --> 01:31:29,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow!

1409
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:32,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's a GM in the game.

1410
01:31:32,713 --> 01:31:35,114
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can probably imagine, this guy got canned.

1411
01:31:35,134 --> 01:31:38,676
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the part that's kind of irritating.

1412
01:31:39,656 --> 01:31:41,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So the whole thing was a big joke.

1413
01:31:41,557 --> 01:31:45,059
[SPEAKER_09]: The player then suddenly yells, this is Sparta.

1414
01:31:46,019 --> 01:31:48,581
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so kinky, you just cybered with a dude.

1415
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:53,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the GM says, LOL, why did you want this then?

1416
01:31:53,243 --> 01:31:53,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you gay?

1417
01:31:54,303 --> 01:31:55,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you serious?

1418
01:31:55,184 --> 01:31:57,065
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the player says, serious about what?

1419
01:31:58,126 --> 01:32:01,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I was joking about the fapping, but then I am indeed the dude.

1420
01:32:01,632 --> 01:32:05,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And the GM says, LOL, okay, glad I put my clothes back on.

1421
01:32:05,498 --> 01:32:09,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the player says, yeah, probably a good idea, I have AIDS.

1422
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:21,502
[SPEAKER_09]: You had me going here at the lulzy factor, but then this is the equivalent of me getting up on stage and telling this hilarious joke.

1423
01:32:21,562 --> 01:32:28,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine I'm Ellen DeGeneres, and I come out on stage, and I'm really funny, and everybody's laughing, and I'm making jokes at people's expenses.

1424
01:32:28,444 --> 01:32:33,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the very end of my show, I take my pants off, and I poop live on stage.

1425
01:32:34,105 --> 01:32:36,026
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of what happened here.

1426
01:32:36,986 --> 01:32:39,887
[SPEAKER_09]: LOL, you had to end it with the ha-ha gay AIDS joke.

1427
01:32:41,876 --> 01:32:42,437
[SPEAKER_09]: You suck.

1428
01:32:43,638 --> 01:32:44,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not funny.

1429
01:32:45,079 --> 01:32:49,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And this poor guy probably got fired over what you did and posting all these things on the internet.

1430
01:32:50,045 --> 01:32:53,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you wanted to be funny, that wasn't the way to go about doing it.

1431
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:55,331
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can suck it.

1432
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:57,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And you make me very angry.

1433
01:32:57,413 --> 01:32:58,915
[SPEAKER_09]: And therefore, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

1434
01:33:00,563 --> 01:33:00,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1435
01:33:00,883 --> 01:33:01,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a comment, DarkSakura?

1436
01:33:01,964 --> 01:33:02,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a comment.

1437
01:33:02,685 --> 01:33:03,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, go ahead.

1438
01:33:03,145 --> 01:33:03,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1439
01:33:03,846 --> 01:33:10,051
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, though, that's a big pile of mutual stupidity, so I don't feel sorry for either of them.

1440
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,253
[SPEAKER_09]: The GM's no dumber than you are, my friend.

1441
01:33:13,874 --> 01:33:14,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Not you.

1442
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:16,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I'm looking at you, but I mean the user.

1443
01:33:17,608 --> 01:33:44,971
[SPEAKER_02]: the user first of all is an asshole and also pretty much dumb fuck for the little comment at the end but the GM should have been a GM in the first place if you know they were going to basically act inappropriately especially if it's like a private server that's one thing but if this is a public server where someone is technically as an employee for said company they are a representative of the company they should know better

1444
01:33:45,852 --> 01:33:46,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1445
01:33:46,993 --> 01:33:50,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Amaze Satsuma in chat says, Pooping on stage is still better than Carrot Top.

1446
01:33:52,595 --> 01:33:52,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1447
01:33:53,435 --> 01:33:55,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, you get my analogy, alright?

1448
01:33:55,956 --> 01:33:57,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you have to be a smartass about it.

1449
01:33:57,657 --> 01:33:59,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, now, I'm still angsty.

1450
01:33:59,337 --> 01:34:00,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I still have enough residual angst.

1451
01:34:01,638 --> 01:34:03,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully DarkSakura does too to the FUs of the week.

1452
01:34:15,551 --> 01:34:18,514
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week goes towards a hormone.

1453
01:34:18,854 --> 01:34:19,194
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1454
01:34:20,756 --> 01:34:21,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn those hormones.

1455
01:34:21,797 --> 01:34:22,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1456
01:34:22,998 --> 01:34:26,122
[SPEAKER_10]: My FU of the week goes to my high school reunion.

1457
01:34:26,222 --> 01:34:27,783
[SPEAKER_10]: The 10 year high school reunion.

1458
01:34:28,063 --> 01:34:31,147
[SPEAKER_10]: What a complete fucking waste of time and money.

1459
01:34:32,355 --> 01:34:39,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a note for all you people maybe still in high school and thinking, hey, 10 years from now I can go see all my friends again.

1460
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:41,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do it, seriously.

1461
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:46,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, about 30 or 40 people will show up and they're probably the people that you weren't friends with anyways.

1462
01:34:46,102 --> 01:34:47,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Just keep in touch with your friends.

1463
01:34:51,142 --> 01:34:53,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Me, myself, I don't really have a whole lot of FUs of the week.

1464
01:34:53,663 --> 01:34:54,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a fairly decent week.

1465
01:34:54,764 --> 01:34:56,224
[SPEAKER_02]: If I kick you, will you have an FU?

1466
01:34:56,985 --> 01:34:57,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I will.

1467
01:34:57,565 --> 01:34:58,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I will have an FU.

1468
01:34:59,586 --> 01:35:00,406
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to the ferret.

1469
01:35:00,806 --> 01:35:01,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It stings.

1470
01:35:01,567 --> 01:35:05,709
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know I had a bad... FU to drama.

1471
01:35:06,069 --> 01:35:06,829
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll leave it at that.

1472
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:09,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there has been drama recently and it's no fun at all.

1473
01:35:10,231 --> 01:35:11,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Drama is poopy.

1474
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:12,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Drama is poopy.

1475
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:13,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Drama is no fun.

1476
01:35:13,232 --> 01:35:14,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Save the drama for your llama.

1477
01:35:14,753 --> 01:35:15,653
[SPEAKER_09]: A gun is no fun.

1478
01:35:17,454 --> 01:35:19,435
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a character on WoW called Drama Llama.

1479
01:35:20,054 --> 01:35:21,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Guns are lots of fun.

1480
01:35:22,495 --> 01:35:24,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Guns are fun unless you're shooting people with guns.

1481
01:35:24,575 --> 01:35:25,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Then they're not fun.

1482
01:35:26,496 --> 01:35:28,376
[SPEAKER_09]: But shooting cats with guns is hilarious.

1483
01:35:28,436 --> 01:35:28,856
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

1484
01:35:28,896 --> 01:35:29,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.

1485
01:35:29,596 --> 01:35:30,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not funny.

1486
01:35:30,737 --> 01:35:32,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that everyone should have a gun.

1487
01:35:34,237 --> 01:35:35,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm serious.

1488
01:35:36,198 --> 01:35:37,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm completely in the opposite.

1489
01:35:37,418 --> 01:35:38,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go in the political stuff again.

1490
01:35:39,099 --> 01:35:41,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say one thing about that.

1491
01:35:42,619 --> 01:35:44,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Promise me we can get back to gaming after that.

1492
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that most people are good?

1493
01:35:50,194 --> 01:35:50,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people.

1494
01:35:51,375 --> 01:36:01,002
[SPEAKER_02]: If everybody had a gun, a concealed weapon, whether they carried it or not, do you think that someone would be more likely to do a violent crime on someone who may or may not be armed?

1495
01:36:03,364 --> 01:36:04,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want the responsibility that comes with a gun.

1496
01:36:05,305 --> 01:36:07,107
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to have it.

1497
01:36:07,247 --> 01:36:09,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't trust the 1% of people who shouldn't have guns.

1498
01:36:10,609 --> 01:36:15,011
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you think that 1% of the population is going to be stupid enough to attack the rest of the population who might be armed?

1499
01:36:15,231 --> 01:36:15,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1500
01:36:15,792 --> 01:36:16,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1501
01:36:16,092 --> 01:36:16,772
[SPEAKER_09]: It shouldn't have to come to that.

1502
01:36:16,792 --> 01:36:18,773
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I ever have to tell anyone to think about it.

1503
01:36:18,793 --> 01:36:19,514
[SPEAKER_09]: It shouldn't have to come to that.

1504
01:36:19,554 --> 01:36:19,774
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1505
01:36:20,034 --> 01:36:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1506
01:36:20,654 --> 01:36:21,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking.

1507
01:36:21,655 --> 01:36:21,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Ow.

1508
01:36:22,855 --> 01:36:23,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, don't hurt yourself.

1509
01:36:25,357 --> 01:36:26,698
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other people to hurt you for you.

1510
01:36:27,918 --> 01:36:35,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, well, you know one of my favorite games ever is a Hudson game.

1511
01:36:36,617 --> 01:36:37,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Parodia

1512
01:36:58,274 --> 01:37:01,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we didn't get East Book 1 and 2 when it was supposed to be out.

1513
01:37:01,956 --> 01:37:05,638
[SPEAKER_02]: But Star Parodia and Break-In are going to be on Virtual Console.

1514
01:37:06,358 --> 01:37:12,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I've mentioned this plenty of times before, Star Parodia is a parody of Star Soldier.

1515
01:37:13,921 --> 01:37:25,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a game where you basically, you can play as the Twinbee, you can play as Bomberman, or you can play as a flying PC engine and shoot things with hue cards and CDs.

1516
01:37:26,026 --> 01:37:26,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is awesome.

1517
01:37:27,779 --> 01:37:29,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Guns That Shoot Hue Cards I approve of.

1518
01:37:30,061 --> 01:37:30,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

1519
01:37:31,142 --> 01:37:31,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but I'm done.

1520
01:37:33,144 --> 01:37:33,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

1521
01:37:33,544 --> 01:37:34,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hopefully those games actually come out.

1522
01:37:35,706 --> 01:37:42,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've never played this Star Parodia game, and I always hear DarkSakura rave about it, so I'm kind of curious to check it out someday.

1523
01:37:42,933 --> 01:37:44,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1524
01:37:44,134 --> 01:37:44,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1525
01:37:45,313 --> 01:37:46,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1526
01:38:02,185 --> 01:38:02,745
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1527
01:38:17,837 --> 01:38:36,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's now called Mushroom Kingdom Fusion And it's got 12 playable characters now You can actually play as Arthur from Ghouls N' Ghosts You can play as Sonic, Tails, Luigi, Wario, Kirby, Zelda Or I should say Link, Samus, etc.

1528
01:38:36,485 --> 01:38:36,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Tingle?

1529
01:38:37,765 --> 01:38:38,586
[SPEAKER_10]: No Tingle Fail

1530
01:38:39,962 --> 01:38:42,604
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have all sorts of game references in this.

1531
01:38:42,864 --> 01:38:44,365
[SPEAKER_10]: A bunch of different custom levels.

1532
01:38:44,505 --> 01:38:45,506
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all fan-made.

1533
01:38:46,246 --> 01:38:47,487
[SPEAKER_10]: A bunch of different power-ups.

1534
01:38:47,567 --> 01:38:48,768
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fan-gasmed the game.

1535
01:38:49,308 --> 01:38:49,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

1536
01:38:49,929 --> 01:39:01,436
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually download the beta of this, which I have still yet to get to run on my PC because it's very un... I don't know.

1537
01:39:03,249 --> 01:39:03,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1538
01:39:21,295 --> 01:39:35,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Power-ups you can get, including for example, if you get the Mega Man power-up, if you're playing Mario, Mario becomes Mega Mario, Luigi becomes Proto Luigi, Sonic becomes Quick Man, and Tails becomes Gyro Man Tails.

1539
01:39:35,933 --> 01:39:36,413
[SPEAKER_10]: MKFusion.ipbfree

1540
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:01,241
[SPEAKER_10]: IPFreely.com.

1541
01:40:01,801 --> 01:40:03,102
[SPEAKER_10]: IPFreely.com?

1542
01:40:03,202 --> 01:40:03,422
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1543
01:40:03,822 --> 01:40:04,742
[SPEAKER_10]: IPB.

1544
01:40:05,282 --> 01:40:05,922
[SPEAKER_10]: IPB.

1545
01:40:06,883 --> 01:40:07,763
[SPEAKER_09]: IPB Free.

1546
01:40:08,343 --> 01:40:09,203
[SPEAKER_09]: So, alright.

1547
01:40:10,924 --> 01:40:11,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1548
01:40:12,644 --> 01:40:15,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh, I'll have to check this game out when they fix some of their memory problems.

1549
01:40:15,665 --> 01:40:19,826
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds interesting, but it sounds like what would happen if the fans made Super Smash Bros.

1550
01:40:21,124 --> 01:40:21,924
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what would happen.

1551
01:40:23,125 --> 01:40:24,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, talk about legitimate games though.

1552
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:27,186
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's legitimate and something the fanboys definitely want.

1553
01:40:27,747 --> 01:40:30,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Raiden 4 is going to be coming out for the Xbox 360.

1554
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:34,249
[SPEAKER_09]: That has been announced by Moss, who is the developer of Raiden 4.

1555
01:40:34,309 --> 01:40:42,372
[SPEAKER_09]: They are porting the old arcade shoot-em-up to the Xbox 360 and apparently they're actually going to put new aircrafts in the game through download content.

1556
01:40:42,933 --> 01:40:45,053
[SPEAKER_09]: The game comes out September 11th in Japan.

1557
01:40:45,413 --> 01:40:48,815
[SPEAKER_09]: The game's soundtrack is supposed to be included with the game as well, so that's pretty cool.

1558
01:40:49,315 --> 01:40:51,976
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura will read those few emails we did get this week right now

1559
01:41:23,206 --> 01:41:25,887
[SPEAKER_02]: First email is from GS68.

1560
01:41:26,428 --> 01:41:36,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR crew, about the issue of Wii storage space, I'm not sure if this has been brought up yet, but can't you put VC games on an SD card and then put them back on your Wii when you want to play them again?

1561
01:41:37,113 --> 01:41:38,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something wrong with that?

1562
01:41:38,754 --> 01:41:44,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying you're dumbasses or anything, just wondering why you can't transfer your VC games onto an SD card.

1563
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that take too long or is it too inconvenient?

1564
01:41:46,999 --> 01:41:47,319
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1565
01:41:47,339 --> 01:41:50,821
[SPEAKER_02]: This email was brought to you by JustinTV, home of the never-ending spammers and assholes.

1566
01:41:52,006 --> 01:41:53,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, on the it's too inconvenient part.

1567
01:41:53,788 --> 01:41:59,113
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little silly that your Wii can read from it, but yet it can't read data from it and access games.

1568
01:41:59,133 --> 01:42:01,115
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like not being able to run a picture.

1569
01:42:01,395 --> 01:42:01,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine this.

1570
01:42:01,996 --> 01:42:07,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time you wanted to look at pictures on a USB card, you had to copy them to your computer to view them.

1571
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:08,802
[SPEAKER_09]: You couldn't view them right off your USB card.

1572
01:42:08,842 --> 01:42:09,503
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of annoying.

1573
01:42:09,863 --> 01:42:10,283
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1574
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:13,181
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1575
01:42:32,262 --> 01:42:45,273
[SPEAKER_02]: If I wanted to play them, you know, later on, like, you know, like, for example, if I was playing, like, a lot of Alien Crush, I wouldn't move Alien Crush off there, but if, say, I played through, you know, what's another one on there, Blaster Master, and was kind of tired of it.

1576
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:46,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Not yet, but someday.

1577
01:42:46,774 --> 01:42:48,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just picking, I think, arbitrary title.

1578
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:49,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

1579
01:42:49,296 --> 01:42:58,264
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that would be the case that I think that that could be okay, but if it's, if you're, but not in a,

1580
01:42:59,867 --> 01:43:03,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to, you know, do this every time with every game.

1581
01:43:04,128 --> 01:43:05,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Cananagram has a good point.

1582
01:43:05,749 --> 01:43:09,630
[SPEAKER_09]: He says it just takes too long to copy back on the Wii, especially Nintendo 64 games.

1583
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:10,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a good point.

1584
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:11,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1585
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:17,552
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I wonder how those TurboGrafx CD games would be.

1586
01:43:18,172 --> 01:43:18,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't know.

1587
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:19,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't know.

1588
01:43:19,532 --> 01:43:21,373
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a little silly it's not supported yet.

1589
01:43:21,413 --> 01:43:26,014
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if the slot access is too slow, but it's just, it's the principle.

1590
01:43:28,668 --> 01:43:29,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1591
01:43:30,009 --> 01:43:30,969
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Saltech.

1592
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR.

1593
01:43:33,051 --> 01:43:36,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to point out one thing the R4 has done for Nintendo.

1594
01:43:36,474 --> 01:43:41,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of the five people I know who own DSs, four of them bought it only because of the R4, myself included.

1595
01:43:41,598 --> 01:43:46,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is going to make money because the R4 since they make money on every DS sold.

1596
01:43:48,763 --> 01:43:57,908
[SPEAKER_02]: where it is really bad for the third party developers because people will not be purchasing those games which is unfortunate but happens when devices like this are released.

1597
01:43:58,388 --> 01:44:01,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the great work and I apologize if my grammar sucks but I'm very bad at writing.

1598
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:02,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Saltech.

1599
01:44:02,731 --> 01:44:03,591
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, I forgive you.

1600
01:44:04,451 --> 01:44:04,972
[SPEAKER_02]: This time.

1601
01:44:05,629 --> 01:44:07,490
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, I think you're kind of in the minority, though.

1602
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:15,334
[SPEAKER_09]: You and your friends are probably kind of a group of hackers, in the sense that you enjoy these types of things in the systems.

1603
01:44:15,374 --> 01:44:18,376
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably also bought a PSP so you could play NES games on it.

1604
01:44:18,416 --> 01:44:19,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be wrong.

1605
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:25,800
[SPEAKER_09]: But do realize you and your friends are not the mass gamer, if that makes sense.

1606
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying I disagree with you.

1607
01:44:28,361 --> 01:44:32,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying you can't say that four out of all five gamers only bought a DS for the R4.

1608
01:44:32,663 --> 01:44:33,163
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the thing.

1609
01:44:33,763 --> 01:44:34,723
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only point I'm trying to make.

1610
01:44:35,024 --> 01:44:37,665
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think the R4 is a bad device when used appropriately.

1611
01:44:37,825 --> 01:44:40,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I am all for breaking region locks.

1612
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:41,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I am all for that.

1613
01:44:42,607 --> 01:44:50,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the next and last email I should say, I'm actually going to be kind and check and see if there's one more email because I am kind.

1614
01:44:54,912 --> 01:44:55,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we did get one.

1615
01:44:57,094 --> 01:45:17,015
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR, I was checking to see if OLR has any events or special guests for the 300th show and if there's any room in the studio slash garage I would like to attend pending travel arrangements slash work here is some of the reasons which can earn me a spot in the studio as an attendee slash guest this person is very fond of slashes

1616
01:45:18,176 --> 01:45:32,673
[SPEAKER_02]: having met DarkSakura must meet Sky and Loki to complete meeting the trifecta of OLR hosts gave DMN a ride home 35 miles from the arcade somehow triggering the random chain of events which would include DarkSakura paying for one of my games of DDR the following month

1617
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:36,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I play DDR.

1618
01:45:37,231 --> 01:45:40,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I am probably one of the oldest skilled DDR players.

1619
01:45:40,672 --> 01:45:43,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just turned 31 and I can keep up with people nearly half my age.

1620
01:45:44,633 --> 01:45:50,736
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, great scene, close pick, On My Summer Love is an indication I might have to see OLR Live in order to AAA that song.

1621
01:45:52,776 --> 01:45:55,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I have DDR Player as my license plate on my car.

1622
01:45:56,057 --> 01:45:57,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I must pay tribute to the fairy.

1623
01:45:58,338 --> 01:46:04,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are just a few reasons to be there during the 300th show in some form or another, LOL.

1624
01:46:05,286 --> 01:46:12,934
[SPEAKER_02]: This email was brought to you by Olive Garden, home of the never-ending Olive Garden insert contextual question mark pound 78 dot track dot google dot com.

1625
01:46:13,715 --> 01:46:15,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out and triple A, Jammer J.

1626
01:46:17,165 --> 01:46:19,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be honest, I haven't even thought about the 300th episode yet.

1627
01:46:19,667 --> 01:46:20,608
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still two months off.

1628
01:46:21,149 --> 01:46:22,490
[SPEAKER_09]: There's packs kind of in the way.

1629
01:46:24,051 --> 01:46:24,792
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a little while.

1630
01:46:25,513 --> 01:46:26,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I saw the pictures.

1631
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:31,378
[SPEAKER_09]: You, my friend, are a DDR fan if I've ever seen one.

1632
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:33,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1633
01:46:34,041 --> 01:46:35,162
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big question mark right now.

1634
01:46:35,202 --> 01:46:35,522
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1635
01:46:35,562 --> 01:46:36,122
[SPEAKER_02]: More to come.

1636
01:46:36,403 --> 01:46:37,904
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys want to see for the 300th episode?

1637
01:46:37,924 --> 01:46:39,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, what a nice perfect attack on my summer love.

1638
01:46:40,373 --> 01:46:42,414
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys want to see us do for our 300th episode?

1639
01:46:42,634 --> 01:46:42,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1640
01:46:43,194 --> 01:46:44,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I want pizza and beer and ice cream.

1641
01:46:45,275 --> 01:46:45,635
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1642
01:46:46,355 --> 01:46:49,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to go back real quick because I'm an idiot and I got called out on it in chat.

1643
01:46:49,917 --> 01:46:53,318
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru says the DS has no region lock and I should know that.

1644
01:46:53,358 --> 01:46:57,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen the import games for sale right on the store shelves next to the American games.

1645
01:46:57,579 --> 01:46:58,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the hell I was smoking.

1646
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:02,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be honest, I don't use the DS a lot for region locks.

1647
01:47:02,942 --> 01:47:05,984
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more for the PlayStation games where I'd like to get around it.

1648
01:47:06,704 --> 01:47:09,926
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking, I've played Owen Don on my DS, I should know better.

1649
01:47:10,546 --> 01:47:11,067
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyhow.

1650
01:47:12,267 --> 01:47:13,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Owen Don on my DS.

1651
01:47:13,808 --> 01:47:14,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought puppies from him.

1652
01:47:16,641 --> 01:47:22,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So, sorry, anyway, as far as the 300th episode, to be determined, don't know.

1653
01:47:22,584 --> 01:47:26,826
[SPEAKER_09]: We're always welcoming of other people in the studio, but, you know, just try to give us a little advance warning.

1654
01:47:27,226 --> 01:47:30,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, I would, honestly, you really want to come out here just for the show?

1655
01:47:31,048 --> 01:47:38,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you're going to go to San Francisco and do some tourism around there, cool, but it ain't worth it to fly out here just for our little thing.

1656
01:47:38,071 --> 01:47:39,091
[SPEAKER_09]: You can call in on Skype.

1657
01:47:40,452 --> 01:47:44,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm not trying to, you know, just being honest, we're not that exciting people.

1658
01:47:45,965 --> 01:47:46,785
[SPEAKER_09]: We're simple people.

1659
01:47:47,065 --> 01:47:48,086
[SPEAKER_09]: We're like Amish people, right?

1660
01:47:48,206 --> 01:47:49,186
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura with video games.

1661
01:47:50,386 --> 01:47:53,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we video game-ish?

1662
01:47:54,667 --> 01:47:55,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Video game Amish?

1663
01:47:55,867 --> 01:47:56,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Video game Amish?

1664
01:47:56,968 --> 01:47:57,588
[SPEAKER_02]: One more email!

1665
01:47:57,628 --> 01:47:59,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Because someone snuck in.

1666
01:47:59,548 --> 01:48:00,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments from chat.

1667
01:48:00,448 --> 01:48:03,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says episode 300 should be on Mexico, tequila, tacos, and more.

1668
01:48:04,369 --> 01:48:09,150
[SPEAKER_09]: JVMons, and he is from Mexico, so he can try to lobby us to get there just like JVMons is doing.

1669
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:11,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Episode 300 should be in New York City.

1670
01:48:12,772 --> 01:48:14,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says, Episode 300 should be in space.

1671
01:48:15,194 --> 01:48:17,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I said things we can realistically do.

1672
01:48:17,215 --> 01:48:19,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I think OLR in space is not going to happen.

1673
01:48:21,299 --> 01:48:22,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the ring of that.

1674
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:23,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1675
01:48:24,001 --> 01:48:25,302
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR in space.

1676
01:48:25,362 --> 01:48:26,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one more email.

1677
01:48:27,711 --> 01:48:40,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, last one says, Hi folks, since I just got an Xbox 360 Elite on August 2nd, I have some questions for you, mainly directed at Rob, since I know he has a 360, but Loki and DarkSakura can feel free to chime in too.

1678
01:48:40,487 --> 01:48:43,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, thank you so much for your permission.

1679
01:48:43,491 --> 01:48:45,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it's nice that the listeners give you permission.

1680
01:48:47,606 --> 01:48:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.

1681
01:48:47,966 --> 01:48:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: For those in my situation where we both have the PS3 and a 360, is it worth getting the same multi-platform games over again if we already have the given game on one of the consoles?

1682
01:48:57,677 --> 01:49:00,640
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Call of Duty 4, Rock Band, etc.

1683
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:01,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

1684
01:49:01,782 --> 01:49:02,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

1685
01:49:02,907 --> 01:49:03,107
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1686
01:49:03,688 --> 01:49:05,649
[SPEAKER_09]: If you must, sell your other one back.

1687
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:08,872
[SPEAKER_09]: At least get some credit for it before you buy the other one.

1688
01:49:08,912 --> 01:49:09,953
[SPEAKER_09]: If you feel you must.

1689
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:15,357
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how some games try to milk money out of you, though, is by trying to entice you to buy it again.

1690
01:49:15,398 --> 01:49:18,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Soul Calibur 4, the whole Vader-Yoda thing.

1691
01:49:20,101 --> 01:49:24,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, I liked your theory about buying that other game to get both unlocked.

1692
01:49:24,885 --> 01:49:25,666
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very likely.

1693
01:49:28,088 --> 01:49:29,329
[SPEAKER_09]: My simple answer is no.

1694
01:49:29,489 --> 01:49:30,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll ask him.

1695
01:49:31,963 --> 01:49:34,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Rarely is that type of thing worth it.

1696
01:49:35,026 --> 01:49:38,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes the game might really have a lot extra when it comes out on the other console.

1697
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:48,680
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like Bioshock might have, but even then I would want to sell my Bioshock on 360 back if I'm going to get it on PlayStation 3, which is actually not something I would do in the real world, but at least do that.

1698
01:49:50,134 --> 01:49:52,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving right along to the next question.

1699
01:49:53,316 --> 01:49:58,780
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could come up with a top five list of games for a 360 owner should have, what games would those be?

1700
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:02,682
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like, you can have separate lists for disc-based games and Xbox Live arcade games.

1701
01:50:03,223 --> 01:50:06,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go ahead and tell you a few that I have.

1702
01:50:06,565 --> 01:50:08,926
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, get Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

1703
01:50:09,507 --> 01:50:11,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the hell out of that game.

1704
01:50:11,608 --> 01:50:12,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second one's coming out, too.

1705
01:50:13,902 --> 01:50:14,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lots of fun.

1706
01:50:15,663 --> 01:50:18,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead Rising, you can kill zombies with a lawnmower.

1707
01:50:18,804 --> 01:50:20,264
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fun for five seconds.

1708
01:50:22,385 --> 01:50:24,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live Arcade.

1709
01:50:24,605 --> 01:50:27,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1710
01:50:29,266 --> 01:50:30,247
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was it that we were playing?

1711
01:50:34,835 --> 01:50:34,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Rez

1712
01:50:50,794 --> 01:50:53,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Symphony of the Night if you don't already have access to it on PlayStation.

1713
01:50:53,815 --> 01:51:00,478
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do, go Luminous if you've never played it before and you haven't gotten it on any other console like the PSP.

1714
01:51:00,498 --> 01:51:09,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would say something like Uno or go try something a little different like Catan or Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride.

1715
01:51:09,522 --> 01:51:11,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Try one of those games on for size.

1716
01:51:11,903 --> 01:51:12,663
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't get Yaris.

1717
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:15,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, don't be enticed by it.

1718
01:51:15,084 --> 01:51:15,924
[SPEAKER_09]: It's free.

1719
01:51:16,065 --> 01:51:16,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Same with Totem Ball.

1720
01:51:18,746 --> 01:51:21,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Any contribution, Loki?

1721
01:51:23,227 --> 01:51:23,707
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1722
01:51:23,747 --> 01:51:28,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm being distracted by people saying that I need to be in a Tingle suit for the 300th show.

1723
01:51:28,629 --> 01:51:29,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Silly chat room.

1724
01:51:29,969 --> 01:51:30,729
[SPEAKER_02]: That ain't happening.

1725
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:34,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommend five Xbox 360 games our new listeners should pick up.

1726
01:51:34,811 --> 01:51:35,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Xbox Live Arcade.

1727
01:51:35,931 --> 01:51:37,231
[SPEAKER_10]: When are they picking up their 360?

1728
01:51:37,291 --> 01:51:37,932
[SPEAKER_10]: They already have it.

1729
01:51:37,992 --> 01:51:38,572
[SPEAKER_10]: They already have it.

1730
01:51:38,612 --> 01:51:40,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1731
01:51:41,273 --> 01:51:41,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1732
01:51:41,733 --> 01:51:45,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I would do Earth Defense Force 2017.

1733
01:51:48,058 --> 01:51:49,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's dirt cheap now, seriously.

1734
01:51:49,699 --> 01:51:51,240
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like five bucks or something.

1735
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:52,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, alright.

1736
01:51:54,341 --> 01:51:57,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Crackdown, if you want, I mean, because that's dirt cheap right now, too.

1737
01:51:57,223 --> 01:51:57,803
[SPEAKER_02]: The jumping game.

1738
01:51:59,884 --> 01:52:01,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say the original Saints Row, if you want.

1739
01:52:01,785 --> 01:52:05,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you... I guess that's also dirt cheap.

1740
01:52:05,768 --> 01:52:09,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with JV Mon, who's flooding Lost Odyssey, if you're remotely interested in RPGs.

1741
01:52:11,070 --> 01:52:11,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

1742
01:52:11,451 --> 01:52:16,794
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of RPGs coming out, though, pretty soon, so... Lost Odyssey, I guess.

1743
01:52:17,274 --> 01:52:17,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1744
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:27,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Bioshock's good and probably OMG Halo 3.

1745
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:27,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

1746
01:52:30,553 --> 01:52:31,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not recommend Halo 3.

1747
01:52:31,733 --> 01:52:32,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Call of Duty 4.

1748
01:52:33,313 --> 01:52:33,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1749
01:52:35,394 --> 01:52:35,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that it?

1750
01:52:35,754 --> 01:52:36,234
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1751
01:52:36,414 --> 01:52:36,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1752
01:52:36,734 --> 01:52:36,954
[SPEAKER_09]: More.

1753
01:52:37,454 --> 01:52:37,714
[SPEAKER_09]: More.

1754
01:52:39,415 --> 01:52:39,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1755
01:52:40,785 --> 01:52:45,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving forward, have you had any issues with any other players in Xbox Live?

1756
01:52:45,186 --> 01:52:47,367
[SPEAKER_02]: People essentially being annoying or all around a-holes.

1757
01:52:47,827 --> 01:52:49,587
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, what's the best way to deal with that issue?

1758
01:52:49,867 --> 01:52:50,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't play with strangers.

1759
01:52:51,068 --> 01:52:51,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't play with strangers.

1760
01:52:52,468 --> 01:52:54,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Build up a friends list of good people.

1761
01:52:54,589 --> 01:52:57,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And I urge you to start on OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash forums.

1762
01:52:58,290 --> 01:53:03,231
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that's not enough for you, go visit other forums that you like and get other Xbox Live gamer tags.

1763
01:53:03,571 --> 01:53:04,471
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't play with strangers.

1764
01:53:04,511 --> 01:53:05,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Play with friends.

1765
01:53:05,472 --> 01:53:07,172
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only way you're going to avoid idiocy.

1766
01:53:07,352 --> 01:53:11,934
[SPEAKER_02]: or make sure that you can play in a game where you make sure you start the game and you can boot the players.

1767
01:53:12,394 --> 01:53:13,394
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another good tip.

1768
01:53:13,414 --> 01:53:14,635
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to meet people.

1769
01:53:14,675 --> 01:53:15,755
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually a very good tip.

1770
01:53:16,535 --> 01:53:19,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, play games that idiots don't understand.

1771
01:53:19,396 --> 01:53:21,737
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one reason I recommended Catan and Carcassonne.

1772
01:53:21,757 --> 01:53:22,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Play games that idiots don't understand.

1773
01:53:22,938 --> 01:53:25,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Learn to laugh at the idiots instead of being offended by them.

1774
01:53:25,999 --> 01:53:31,041
[SPEAKER_10]: We did that one time when we played a bunch of people in the UK at Grand Theft Auto 4 and we kicked crap out of them.

1775
01:53:31,081 --> 01:53:31,501
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like

1776
01:53:31,901 --> 01:53:34,382
[SPEAKER_10]: It was about all these obscenities, and it was funny.

1777
01:53:34,422 --> 01:53:36,562
[SPEAKER_10]: We were just like, ah, they're angry.

1778
01:53:37,022 --> 01:53:38,363
[SPEAKER_10]: They're swearing with an accent.

1779
01:53:38,423 --> 01:53:39,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha, ha, ha.

1780
01:53:39,363 --> 01:53:39,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1781
01:53:39,983 --> 01:53:41,684
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using words like, you know.

1782
01:53:42,184 --> 01:53:43,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

1783
01:53:44,424 --> 01:53:46,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have to say, chat room reminded, orange box.

1784
01:53:46,745 --> 01:53:48,486
[SPEAKER_09]: None of us said orange box, and we really should have.

1785
01:53:48,506 --> 01:53:49,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you need portal.

1786
01:53:50,126 --> 01:53:50,806
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, sorry, go ahead.

1787
01:53:50,946 --> 01:53:57,308
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was also going to say, it just goes back to what was it I was saying a few weeks ago, learn to be offended?

1788
01:53:59,406 --> 01:54:00,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree to an extent.

1789
01:54:00,426 --> 01:54:02,127
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much idiocy on Xbox Live though.

1790
01:54:02,147 --> 01:54:03,467
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so, so much.

1791
01:54:03,767 --> 01:54:04,327
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets old.

1792
01:54:04,667 --> 01:54:06,988
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny the first few times, it gets so old.

1793
01:54:07,948 --> 01:54:10,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I report every single one because I'm that guy.

1794
01:54:12,009 --> 01:54:13,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Last question on here.

1795
01:54:14,509 --> 01:54:17,730
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind, would you please send me a friends list invite on Xbox Live?

1796
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:20,791
[SPEAKER_02]: My gamertag is Spazinator on PSN.

1797
01:54:21,771 --> 01:54:23,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Minus the quotes, obviously.

1798
01:54:24,412 --> 01:54:25,232
[SPEAKER_09]: What about Xbox Live?

1799
01:54:26,522 --> 01:54:28,704
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1800
01:54:48,624 --> 01:54:52,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, if anyone has, Dan's, isn't his Gunstar underscore hero?

1801
01:54:52,607 --> 01:54:54,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I don't remember, to be honest.

1802
01:54:54,229 --> 01:54:54,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

1803
01:54:54,609 --> 01:55:07,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dan's his Gunstar hero, and he, um, boots people that he doesn't recognize, and so he's booted some people that I added on there, so if you add him and he boots you, don't be offended, it's not me, it's my husband.

1804
01:55:07,159 --> 01:55:08,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, are you full yet?

1805
01:55:09,222 --> 01:55:10,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I have like 70-something.

1806
01:55:11,163 --> 01:55:12,403
[SPEAKER_10]: So LokiOLR, right?

1807
01:55:12,803 --> 01:55:14,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki space OLR, all caps.

1808
01:55:14,724 --> 01:55:15,845
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1809
01:55:16,245 --> 01:55:20,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions as it's highly appreciated.

1810
01:55:20,966 --> 01:55:21,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1811
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:23,087
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really nice letter.

1812
01:55:23,127 --> 01:55:23,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1813
01:55:24,708 --> 01:55:31,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I add everybody, but don't expect me to play with you during the middle of the day when I'm at work doing our two 15-minute multiplayer games.

1814
01:55:31,991 --> 01:55:33,011
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll ignore your invites.

1815
01:55:34,502 --> 01:55:40,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, don't... Just because... Yeah, that's another thing, because that's kind of happened lately, is that I'm... Without fail, I always get invited to games.

1816
01:55:40,607 --> 01:55:45,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't be offended if I turn them down, but keep in mind, sometimes when I turn on the Xbox, I have a game in mind I want to play.

1817
01:55:45,871 --> 01:55:50,755
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to go back... Like, I don't even know where my copy of Halo 3 is, and I can't... Like, from several people, I get Halo 3 invites.

1818
01:55:51,116 --> 01:55:52,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't be offended when I decline them.

1819
01:55:52,517 --> 01:55:54,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't... That's not the game I feel like playing.

1820
01:55:54,058 --> 01:55:54,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, same.

1821
01:55:54,298 --> 01:55:59,242
[SPEAKER_10]: I get granted a lot of horror invites when I'm not playing it, and Nelly's playing, like, Zuma or Bejeweled, so...

1822
01:56:00,003 --> 01:56:00,244
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura,

1823
01:56:07,325 --> 01:56:33,136
[SPEAKER_09]: but I do certain random things will happen like I got into a random Uno game the other night with some all games people and we had a good time not that I don't join random games every now and then I just haven't lately like right now it's all about Braid and Geometry Wars which sadly are not multiplayer so if you catch me in a good mood I can do Soul Calibur 4 if you catch me in a Soul Calibur mood anyhow, sorry was that it for Mailbag?

1824
01:56:33,276 --> 01:56:34,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was yeah

1825
01:56:35,137 --> 01:56:36,157
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so send us more.

1826
01:56:36,218 --> 01:56:37,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com.

1827
01:56:38,098 --> 01:56:41,060
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt in chat says, Dear Microsoft, expand the friends list count.

1828
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:41,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thanks.

1829
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:42,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

1830
01:56:42,841 --> 01:56:43,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, next story.

1831
01:56:44,181 --> 01:56:54,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know if this is, like, you know, important or anything, but G4 has announced the winners of the G4IA 2008 Awards, which were voted on by the fans.

1832
01:56:55,046 --> 01:56:56,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?

1833
01:56:57,747 --> 01:56:59,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And here are the winners.

1834
01:56:59,468 --> 01:57:00,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Game of the Year, Halo 3.

1835
01:57:02,781 --> 01:57:04,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Why no love for Grand Theft Auto 4?

1836
01:57:04,183 --> 01:57:04,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

1837
01:57:05,504 --> 01:57:07,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Favorite system, Xbox 360.

[SPEAKER_10]: Best graphics, Metal Gear Solid 4.

[SPEAKER_10]: And then the awards were over!

1845
01:57:54,014 --> 01:57:58,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I just saved you about three hours, or two hours, or however long this damn ceremony goes.

1846
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:02,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Jvmon says, Grand Theft Auto 4 kind of sucked.

1847
01:58:02,822 --> 01:58:05,464
[SPEAKER_09]: He's in the minority, but Niko is the best video game character in a long time.

1848
01:58:06,065 --> 01:58:13,411
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that Grand Theft Auto was super duper awesome, because it was pretty awesome, but Halo 3 wasn't that awesome, let me put it that way.

1849
01:58:14,012 --> 01:58:14,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it wasn't...

1850
01:58:15,566 --> 01:58:16,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo 3, New Paintjob

1851
01:58:46,909 --> 01:58:47,650
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1852
01:59:18,392 --> 01:59:18,972
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.

1853
01:59:19,032 --> 01:59:22,193
[SPEAKER_09]: It's officially happening on the PlayStation Network on August 14th.

1854
01:59:23,633 --> 01:59:33,415
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually duel the creator of Eye of Judgment from Japan Studio if you are so lucky to in this game.

1855
01:59:33,756 --> 01:59:40,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they're actually doing a tournament-style thing or if this is one of those, hey, why doesn't everybody play this game online at the same time so there's lots of people playing?

1856
01:59:41,337 --> 01:59:45,118
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know exactly what it is, but it sounds like it could be interesting.

1857
01:59:46,539 --> 01:59:47,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there you have it.

1858
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:50,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Play some Eye of Judgment on August 14th if you actually have it.

1859
01:59:51,343 --> 01:59:57,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, even so, you've got more incentive to be able to play Eye of Judgment.

1860
01:59:57,448 --> 02:00:00,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is great news for Loki, although it's probably not going to help at all.

1861
02:00:01,892 --> 02:00:06,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Circuit City has Eye of Judgment and the PlayStation Eye for $40.

1862
02:00:07,196 --> 02:00:09,719
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on sale!

1863
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:12,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And Walmart has it for $30.

1864
02:00:12,761 --> 02:00:12,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

1865
02:00:16,141 --> 02:00:18,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Time to go buy those things off the shelves.

1866
02:00:18,061 --> 02:00:18,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start moving them.

1867
02:00:19,222 --> 02:00:20,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might actually go pick up one.

1868
02:00:21,022 --> 02:00:21,602
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1869
02:00:21,682 --> 02:00:22,783
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one in a million.

1870
02:00:23,183 --> 02:00:23,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Only $999,999 more to go.

1871
02:00:23,963 --> 02:00:28,364
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's at Walmart for $30, hell yeah, I'll get it just to have the webcam.

1872
02:00:28,404 --> 02:00:32,545
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good price for the PlayStation Eye because I think the PlayStation Eye by itself is like $39.99.

1873
02:00:34,466 --> 02:00:37,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Even I would pick it up just because someday I'll probably get a PlayStation 3.

1874
02:00:37,907 --> 02:00:38,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd pick it up to burn it.

1875
02:00:40,619 --> 02:00:44,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd pick it up to have the webcam because you can use the webcam on your PC.

1876
02:00:44,923 --> 02:00:46,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's better than the webcam I have now.

1877
02:00:46,644 --> 02:00:50,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use my webcam for anything other than taking random pictures, but, you know.

1878
02:00:50,447 --> 02:00:54,370
[SPEAKER_09]: The webcam we use for OLRs, Justin TV, is an actual video camera at this point.

1879
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:55,751
[SPEAKER_02]: But we used to use an iRite.

1880
02:00:55,771 --> 02:00:56,712
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to use an iSight.

1881
02:00:57,192 --> 02:00:57,472
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

1882
02:00:57,492 --> 02:00:58,353
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we used to use.

1883
02:00:58,373 --> 02:01:00,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it broke because I dropped it on the ground.

1884
02:01:00,054 --> 02:01:01,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Before that, we used to use an iToy.

1885
02:01:02,316 --> 02:01:04,077
[SPEAKER_09]: We did, for a little while, use an iToy.

1886
02:01:04,097 --> 02:01:04,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.

1887
02:01:05,278 --> 02:01:06,439
[SPEAKER_09]: That was back in the day.

1888
02:01:08,581 --> 02:01:09,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1889
02:01:10,362 --> 02:01:13,944
[SPEAKER_09]: So, lots of Eye of Judgment news around.

1890
02:01:14,264 --> 02:01:15,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't you excited, Loki?

1891
02:01:15,985 --> 02:01:18,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I was the one that posted this story, so... I think they're desperate.

1892
02:01:19,107 --> 02:01:21,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm well aware of what's going on in the Eye of Judgment world.

1893
02:01:23,070 --> 02:01:26,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the lack thereof of what's going on in the Eye of Judgment world.

1894
02:01:26,852 --> 02:01:30,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, something that's about as ridiculous as playing a card game over your PS3.

1895
02:01:31,254 --> 02:01:33,296
[SPEAKER_10]: How about installing Windows Vista on your PS3?

1896
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:37,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, you can do it.

1897
02:01:37,691 --> 02:01:39,591
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't really mean it's going to work well.

1898
02:01:39,631 --> 02:01:49,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, the guy installed a version of Linux on his other partition of his hard drive, and in Linux, emulated Windows Vista.

1899
02:01:51,414 --> 02:01:58,596
[SPEAKER_10]: And, well, it takes 25 minutes to boot, and 5 minutes to access the start menu, and about 12 minutes to open Notepad.

1900
02:02:00,266 --> 02:02:01,707
[SPEAKER_10]: 12 minutes to open Notepad.

1901
02:02:01,727 --> 02:02:03,728
[SPEAKER_10]: 12 minutes to open Notepad.

1902
02:02:03,788 --> 02:02:05,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Power the cell processor.

1903
02:02:05,848 --> 02:02:06,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1904
02:02:06,649 --> 02:02:13,311
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but seriously, though, I mean, you're emulating an operating system within an operating system, within an operating system, basically.

1905
02:02:13,672 --> 02:02:15,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty says my thoughts exactly in chat.

1906
02:02:15,973 --> 02:02:18,333
[SPEAKER_09]: She says, ew, it's bad enough on PC.

1907
02:02:18,554 --> 02:02:23,256
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be honest, you know, to be honest, Windows Vista just runs like that.

1908
02:02:23,356 --> 02:02:26,497
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, really, stick with Linux.

1909
02:02:27,711 --> 02:02:28,531
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

1910
02:02:28,711 --> 02:02:30,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Minty.

1911
02:02:30,392 --> 02:02:31,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost said Misty Linux.

1912
02:02:31,852 --> 02:02:32,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you'd be excited.

1913
02:02:32,473 --> 02:02:33,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Minty Linux.

1914
02:02:33,613 --> 02:02:36,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know if you can install Minty Linux on a PS3.

1915
02:02:38,115 --> 02:02:40,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it only takes Yellow Dog or something like that.

1916
02:02:41,376 --> 02:02:42,436
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Misty Linux?

1917
02:02:42,516 --> 02:02:44,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that be like an OLR-based Linux system?

1918
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:45,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty Linux?

1919
02:02:45,637 --> 02:02:46,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty Linux.

1920
02:02:46,797 --> 02:02:47,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of Minty Linux.

1921
02:02:47,798 --> 02:02:49,118
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be like Emo Linux.

1922
02:02:49,778 --> 02:02:51,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my eyes are misty.

1923
02:02:51,799 --> 02:02:52,099
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

1924
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:53,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Like our listener Misty.

1925
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:53,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Not like...

1926
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:54,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you.

1927
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:55,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

1928
02:03:18,683 --> 02:03:21,804
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will like you a whole lot, Loki, if you get this for me.

1929
02:03:21,865 --> 02:03:23,125
[SPEAKER_09]: It's LittleBigPlanet.

1930
02:03:23,465 --> 02:03:26,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you'd have to buy me a PS3 as well, so get working on that, okay?

1931
02:03:27,107 --> 02:03:37,052
[SPEAKER_09]: LittleBigPlanet, if you actually pre-order this game, it was revealed by the official US PlayStation blog that apparently there are five separate pre-order bonuses that you can get in North America.

1932
02:03:37,412 --> 02:03:40,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It all depends on where you're going to reserve the game.

1933
02:03:40,353 --> 02:03:45,876
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't said where you reserve it will get you what prize just yet, but one of them is a

1934
02:03:46,496 --> 02:03:47,517
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1935
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:07,271
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

1936
02:04:07,291 --> 02:04:09,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to pre-order a game and get a burlap sack.

1937
02:04:09,193 --> 02:04:09,613
[SPEAKER_09]: That's rad.

1938
02:04:10,113 --> 02:04:13,275
[SPEAKER_09]: A little big sticker book, which is a sticker book.

1939
02:04:13,796 --> 02:04:19,940
[SPEAKER_09]: And the official LittleBigPlanet Creator guide by Brady Games, but only the mini guide.

1940
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:21,981
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the little guide for the little game.

1941
02:04:22,922 --> 02:04:24,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's kind of cute.

1942
02:04:25,764 --> 02:04:26,805
[SPEAKER_09]: That is ugly.

1943
02:04:26,885 --> 02:04:28,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet the Naughty Girl one's better.

1944
02:04:28,606 --> 02:04:29,446
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a poop.

1945
02:04:29,466 --> 02:04:30,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Your butt looks like a poop.

1946
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:36,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1947
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not really too excited about the God of War.

1948
02:04:38,061 --> 02:04:41,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at the one for the Heavenly Sword one.

1949
02:04:41,222 --> 02:04:44,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the burlap sack is like a zipper pouch.

1950
02:04:46,123 --> 02:04:46,723
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.

1951
02:04:47,664 --> 02:04:52,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I would get the little big pouch or the Nariko if it doesn't look as hideous as the Kratos one.

1952
02:04:54,246 --> 02:04:55,706
[SPEAKER_02]: The Heavenly Sword one is really cute.

1953
02:04:55,726 --> 02:04:56,487
[SPEAKER_02]: She looks like a Fraggle.

1954
02:04:57,407 --> 02:04:58,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Fraggles are rad.

1955
02:05:00,908 --> 02:05:02,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?

1956
02:05:03,049 --> 02:05:03,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, they should.

1957
02:05:04,828 --> 02:05:06,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?

1958
02:05:09,212 --> 02:05:11,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe on the ColecoVision or something like that.

1959
02:05:11,774 --> 02:05:13,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, they need a new Fraggle Rock game.

1960
02:05:13,615 --> 02:05:18,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can wait for the remake of the Fraggle Rock movie.

1961
02:05:18,679 --> 02:05:22,422
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to do a remake, I guess, of it or something.

1962
02:05:22,842 --> 02:05:24,584
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there'll be a video game coming out for it.

1963
02:05:26,255 --> 02:05:29,019
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1964
02:05:43,106 --> 02:05:47,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is something that no one will ever be able to forget once they've heard of it.

1965
02:05:49,488 --> 02:05:56,490
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a shooter series that stars heavily muscled men wearing Speedos.

1966
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:00,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Cho Aineke games.

1967
02:06:00,851 --> 02:06:03,832
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is going to be a new Cho Aineke game on PSP.

1968
02:06:04,844 --> 02:06:05,804
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1969
02:06:25,069 --> 02:06:29,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it's like, Uber Muscles and he's got like a little thingy over his, you know, pee-pee.

1970
02:06:30,174 --> 02:06:33,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they wuss out on the, you know, subtle gay porn hints, though?

1971
02:06:34,117 --> 02:06:35,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so at all.

1972
02:06:35,879 --> 02:06:36,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen!

1973
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:42,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know what, I told my husband in no uncertain terms that I'm importing Zero Cho Aniki.

1974
02:06:43,086 --> 02:06:45,228
[SPEAKER_09]: And you should also tell him that you're gonna make him buy it.

1975
02:06:45,888 --> 02:06:46,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I told him.

1976
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:47,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1977
02:06:49,423 --> 02:06:54,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, my friend who introduced me to Linux Mint says no Mint on PS3 as of yet.

1978
02:06:54,926 --> 02:06:55,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1979
02:06:56,387 --> 02:06:56,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Darn.

1980
02:06:56,707 --> 02:06:58,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to spread that on air.

1981
02:06:58,588 --> 02:06:59,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.

1982
02:07:00,149 --> 02:07:00,589
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

1983
02:07:01,589 --> 02:07:03,150
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru says, also, why?

1984
02:07:03,290 --> 02:07:04,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Why, Choaniki?

1985
02:07:04,471 --> 02:07:04,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1986
02:07:05,495 --> 02:07:07,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Cho Aoniki is cool!

1987
02:07:07,517 --> 02:07:12,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And GameGuru would like to also point out that the Fraggle Rock redo is coming from Jim Henson and Disney.

1988
02:07:12,861 --> 02:07:13,781
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully that's a good sign.

1989
02:07:13,801 --> 02:07:15,182
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming from beyond the grave.

1990
02:07:15,463 --> 02:07:16,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1991
02:07:16,583 --> 02:07:17,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God.

1992
02:07:18,705 --> 02:07:24,009
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a couple neat, I guess, mods that have come out for the PSP.

1993
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:30,914
[SPEAKER_10]: The first is actually someone that has basically put a cell phone inside of a PSP.

1994
02:07:32,495 --> 02:07:36,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Where the UMD drive goes, and so now it's a PSP phone.

1995
02:07:37,659 --> 02:07:37,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1996
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:44,043
[SPEAKER_10]: It kind of looks retarded, but hey, it's a phone and it's a PSP.

1997
02:07:44,683 --> 02:07:46,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Something a little bit more functional, though.

1998
02:07:46,324 --> 02:07:48,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything this device can't do?

1999
02:07:48,966 --> 02:07:50,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Something a little bit more functional, though.

2000
02:07:50,707 --> 02:07:55,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Another modder has incorporated a touchscreen to the PSP.

2001
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:57,952
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a little bit better, I would say.

2002
02:07:58,912 --> 02:08:00,533
[SPEAKER_10]: And that project now is called...

2003
02:08:01,474 --> 02:08:03,295
[SPEAKER_10]: The Touchscreen Project for the PSP.

2004
02:08:03,575 --> 02:08:09,099
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on a website called PSPZ Project.

2005
02:08:10,079 --> 02:08:16,683
[SPEAKER_10]: And .dcemu.co.uk And... I don't know.

2006
02:08:16,703 --> 02:08:17,164
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of neat.

2007
02:08:17,204 --> 02:08:17,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, DCEMU.

2008
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:19,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that site.

2009
02:08:19,785 --> 02:08:23,547
[SPEAKER_09]: That was... My Dreamcast got more action from that website than any game.

2010
02:08:23,667 --> 02:08:24,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

2011
02:08:24,128 --> 02:08:26,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember... Was it Feet of Fury?

2012
02:08:26,769 --> 02:08:27,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Heck yeah.

2013
02:08:27,310 --> 02:08:27,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

2014
02:08:29,969 --> 02:08:31,570
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it's interesting.

2015
02:08:31,831 --> 02:08:38,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, he's allowed it to, I guess, have better battery life somehow.

2016
02:08:39,136 --> 02:08:42,359
[SPEAKER_10]: They've redesigned the control pad and some other crap.

2017
02:08:42,599 --> 02:08:45,361
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's working on a keyboard application for it.

2018
02:08:46,022 --> 02:08:46,302
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2019
02:08:46,322 --> 02:08:47,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's pretty neat.

2020
02:08:48,283 --> 02:08:55,229
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be kind of cool to have a touchscreen on the PSP because, for the love of God, typing on that thing sucks.

2021
02:08:57,614 --> 02:09:00,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so wow, we've had Wii hacks and now PSP hacks.

2022
02:09:01,378 --> 02:09:02,499
[SPEAKER_09]: The hackers sure are busy.

2023
02:09:05,181 --> 02:09:09,385
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to end tonight before we go to the Skype line with a story that I know is going to surprise you guys.

2024
02:09:09,405 --> 02:09:11,046
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to knock the socks off of you.

2025
02:09:11,106 --> 02:09:14,409
[SPEAKER_09]: You're never going to believe it, but brace yourselves.

2026
02:09:14,890 --> 02:09:17,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Grand Theft Auto 4 is coming to the PC, y'all.

2027
02:09:18,956 --> 02:09:19,896
[SPEAKER_09]: What?!

2028
02:09:19,956 --> 02:09:20,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Shock, huh?

2029
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:21,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I never would have guessed.

2030
02:09:22,697 --> 02:09:23,597
[SPEAKER_09]: That is unheard of.

2031
02:09:23,797 --> 02:09:27,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I never would have guessed, based on the 50 leaks that came out earlier.

2032
02:09:28,098 --> 02:09:35,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Rockstar finally admitting it, saying, quote, We are very excited to be releasing the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4.

2033
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,581
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the PC.

2034
02:09:40,001 --> 02:09:43,842
[SPEAKER_09]: The game looks and plays beautifully on PC, and we can't wait for people to play it.

2035
02:09:44,603 --> 02:09:52,012
[SPEAKER_09]: It is coming out November 18th in North America November 21st in Europe There is a reason why this is following a story about hacking

2036
02:09:53,231 --> 02:09:55,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, that is all I'm going to say.

2037
02:09:55,713 --> 02:09:56,853
[SPEAKER_09]: That is all I'm going to say.

2038
02:09:57,674 --> 02:09:58,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun.

2039
02:09:58,495 --> 02:10:00,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Just in time for Christmas for the hacking community.

2040
02:10:00,916 --> 02:10:02,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, it's going to be so awesome.

2041
02:10:03,358 --> 02:10:07,600
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing too that's kind of cool about it though is they do have some expanded multiplayer options in there as well.

2042
02:10:07,921 --> 02:10:11,263
[SPEAKER_10]: No word on what that is exactly, but there are going to be some new multiplayer features.

2043
02:10:11,623 --> 02:10:17,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that it would matter anyways because people would add it anyways and recreate all new cities and all sorts of mods.

2044
02:10:17,527 --> 02:10:18,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot wait.

2045
02:10:19,568 --> 02:10:19,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't wait.

2046
02:10:20,809 --> 02:10:21,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2047
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:24,051
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to open up the Skype line now for your calls.

2048
02:10:24,211 --> 02:10:31,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype or if you're feeling so inclined, you can pick up the phone 1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll-free number in the US and Canada.

2049
02:10:32,235 --> 02:10:34,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, if you're overseas, you're going to want to stick to Skype.

2050
02:10:35,276 --> 02:10:36,577
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to pay your phone bill, kids.

2051
02:10:36,937 --> 02:10:37,237
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR

2052
02:11:00,962 --> 02:11:01,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I got sold.

2053
02:11:01,863 --> 02:11:02,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

2054
02:11:03,365 --> 02:11:07,029
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't implode or go under like it closed completely.

2055
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:07,369
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

2056
02:11:07,730 --> 02:11:10,133
[SPEAKER_09]: It's being sold as a property out of Turner.

2057
02:11:10,513 --> 02:11:15,900
[SPEAKER_09]: So sorry if I misrepresented that, which is good that apparently the stream went down right at that moment that I said that.

2058
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:16,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it?

2059
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:19,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's back up now, but we had a weird hiccup in the connection.

2060
02:11:19,745 --> 02:11:20,085
[SPEAKER_03]: How was it?

2061
02:11:21,089 --> 02:11:22,852
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, yeah, because the chat room is going crazy.

2062
02:11:23,352 --> 02:11:25,676
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, oh shoot, Justin TV caught me saying it.

2063
02:11:25,996 --> 02:11:27,739
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, no, Turner sold it off.

2064
02:11:27,759 --> 02:11:29,561
[SPEAKER_09]: He was looking to sell it off, apparently.

2065
02:11:30,082 --> 02:11:31,665
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we'll see.

2066
02:11:33,367 --> 02:11:35,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other last minute stories while we wait for some calls?

2067
02:11:35,268 --> 02:11:38,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, since the stream went dead, 1-877-GAME-OLR, the skype line is open.

2068
02:11:38,750 --> 02:11:41,131
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to hear something funny?

2069
02:11:41,311 --> 02:11:41,811
[SPEAKER_10]: What, Loki?

2070
02:11:42,071 --> 02:11:45,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I was reading up a little bit more on that Mushroom Kingdom fusion.

2071
02:11:45,773 --> 02:11:47,134
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got a bunch of different levels.

2072
02:11:47,154 --> 02:12:00,640
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the Mushroom Kingdom, Alternate Earth, Mega Man's Realm, the Demon Realm, which is based on Doom games, Genena, Shoot'em Up's domain, Realm of Nintendo, Sonic Universe, Halo Ring World, Twisted Reality, and Minus World.

2073
02:12:01,101 --> 02:12:01,261
[SPEAKER_10]: But

2074
02:12:01,881 --> 02:12:04,944
[SPEAKER_10]: In the demon world, the boss is Loki.

2075
02:12:07,306 --> 02:12:08,127
[SPEAKER_09]: How appropriate.

2076
02:12:08,407 --> 02:12:09,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the Skype line.

2077
02:12:09,448 --> 02:12:10,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2078
02:12:10,369 --> 02:12:10,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2079
02:12:11,770 --> 02:12:12,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Legend of Zaku.

2080
02:12:12,430 --> 02:12:12,791
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

2081
02:12:13,311 --> 02:12:13,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Zaku.

2082
02:12:13,832 --> 02:12:14,332
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

2083
02:12:14,392 --> 02:12:15,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Long time no talk.

2084
02:12:15,153 --> 02:12:16,294
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want to talk to us about tonight?

2085
02:12:17,635 --> 02:12:18,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Just random things.

2086
02:12:18,976 --> 02:12:20,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see.

2087
02:12:21,318 --> 02:12:24,161
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I'm just trying to find some stuff.

2088
02:12:26,024 --> 02:12:29,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that whole Madden hype, which apparently is affecting me and others.

2089
02:12:30,469 --> 02:12:33,892
[SPEAKER_06]: How exactly do you make money off of Madden?

2090
02:12:33,932 --> 02:12:34,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Through league play.

2091
02:12:50,878 --> 02:12:55,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you talking online currency or are you talking about some type of shady... No, real money.

2092
02:12:55,361 --> 02:12:58,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Real money through Madden.

2093
02:12:58,684 --> 02:13:00,345
[SPEAKER_06]: He did that through NBA Live recently.

2094
02:13:01,186 --> 02:13:06,189
[SPEAKER_06]: He and a bunch of other players basically did it through MLG or something like that.

2095
02:13:06,369 --> 02:13:13,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I never realized there was this whole underground betting activity going on on Madden and video games.

2096
02:13:13,594 --> 02:13:15,636
[SPEAKER_06]: How much money is your brother making off this?

2097
02:13:16,468 --> 02:13:18,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, it's the team that he's in.

2098
02:13:19,831 --> 02:13:22,253
[SPEAKER_06]: He hasn't told me any specifics, but he did make a lot.

2099
02:13:22,774 --> 02:13:24,435
[SPEAKER_06]: But most of the money is going to the team.

2100
02:13:24,855 --> 02:13:26,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what does the team buy?

2101
02:13:26,957 --> 02:13:28,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Shirts or a whole lot of pot?

2102
02:13:29,379 --> 02:13:31,601
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just to pay off their players, I guess.

2103
02:13:33,723 --> 02:13:34,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, I don't get it.

2104
02:13:35,465 --> 02:13:37,707
[SPEAKER_09]: So then your brother is making money if he's paying off the players?

2105
02:13:40,349 --> 02:13:43,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's actually in the league, so he's actually making money.

2106
02:13:43,992 --> 02:13:49,056
[SPEAKER_06]: The earnings are split pretty much amongst all the other players in his team.

2107
02:13:49,316 --> 02:13:56,722
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I get good at Madden, which will never happen, if I get good at Madden, I could make money off of it on this whole underground gambling circuit?

2108
02:13:57,523 --> 02:13:58,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you could.

2109
02:13:58,243 --> 02:14:00,145
[SPEAKER_06]: They do hold those things from what I hear.

2110
02:14:00,205 --> 02:14:05,349
[SPEAKER_06]: They pretty much hold the underground Madden sessions where they have...

2111
02:14:07,270 --> 02:14:15,520
[SPEAKER_09]: They bet big dollars for each game No, it's just at the private meetups Just like, you know, at people's houses where they just like, you know, they play Madden for money

2112
02:14:25,075 --> 02:14:26,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2113
02:14:27,178 --> 02:14:35,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can't imagine any other game, maybe DDR, unless you put money on... Well, I don't see an underground DDR betting circle starting anytime soon.

2114
02:14:36,328 --> 02:14:37,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it could happen.

2115
02:14:37,369 --> 02:14:38,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it.

2116
02:14:38,811 --> 02:14:42,195
[SPEAKER_06]: You could basically put money on the number of greats you get per song.

2117
02:14:42,904 --> 02:14:44,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the less number of greats, you know.

2118
02:15:01,247 --> 02:15:10,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, besides Digital Life being held next month, coinciding with an anime convention also being held in the same place, that's pretty much it, you know.

2119
02:15:10,870 --> 02:15:11,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Next month, Digital Life, $3,000.

2120
02:15:12,031 --> 02:15:14,612
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you most looking forward to about Digital Life?

2121
02:15:14,652 --> 02:15:16,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there was a little bit of disappointment all around last year.

2122
02:15:16,832 --> 02:15:19,753
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you looking for them to most improve, or what are you looking forward to this year?

2123
02:15:20,934 --> 02:15:21,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.

2124
02:15:21,974 --> 02:15:26,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to, I don't know if there's, they have more, you know, they have more like game, you know,

2125
02:15:27,546 --> 02:15:30,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Game developers showing up instead of all this other marketing crap.

2126
02:15:31,769 --> 02:15:39,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, besides all the swag that you get for free, you could use a few more games like in 06, which was really good.

2127
02:15:39,534 --> 02:15:43,236
[SPEAKER_06]: They had the Wii and everything before it came out.

2128
02:15:44,737 --> 02:15:44,937
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2129
02:15:44,957 --> 02:15:50,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Zaku, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks for calling in, and good luck to your brother.

2130
02:15:50,361 --> 02:15:52,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope he can make your family a lot of money.

2131
02:15:53,547 --> 02:15:54,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I hope so, too.

2132
02:15:54,868 --> 02:15:55,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2133
02:15:55,988 --> 02:15:56,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you can ask for a loan.

2134
02:15:57,148 --> 02:15:57,889
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, buddy.

2135
02:15:59,089 --> 02:15:59,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2136
02:16:00,590 --> 02:16:03,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a loan out to get some of that DDR crack or something.

2137
02:16:03,931 --> 02:16:06,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe if he wins enough money, he can get a 2DX machine for the house.

2138
02:16:06,672 --> 02:16:07,112
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

2139
02:16:07,513 --> 02:16:08,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good, huh?

2140
02:16:09,193 --> 02:16:11,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you ever bet on a video game real money?

2141
02:16:11,594 --> 02:16:16,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I love gambling, but it ends at slot machines nickel size.

2142
02:16:17,016 --> 02:16:18,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I don't play the lottery.

2143
02:16:20,525 --> 02:16:25,349
[SPEAKER_02]: The only closest I've ever done to it is a lottery pool at work where I was only out $2.

2144
02:16:26,489 --> 02:16:29,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that fascinating though that there's this whole betting on Madden circuit?

2145
02:16:29,772 --> 02:16:31,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's freaking sad.

2146
02:16:31,153 --> 02:16:34,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It is in a way, but it's... I don't think gambling is fun.

2147
02:16:35,279 --> 02:16:36,000
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2148
02:16:53,188 --> 02:16:56,290
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, I'm willing to raise the stakes a little bit, like 20.

2149
02:16:57,091 --> 02:16:59,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Most, I think I've ever gambled at night, it's like 60 bucks.

2150
02:16:59,753 --> 02:17:03,175
[SPEAKER_09]: And I go, well, 60 bucks is what I might spend on a video game or spend, you know.

2151
02:17:03,455 --> 02:17:04,296
[SPEAKER_09]: But I always set a limit.

2152
02:17:04,456 --> 02:17:06,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't take my ATM card into those places because it's dangerous.

2153
02:17:07,038 --> 02:17:09,540
[SPEAKER_09]: You go in with a set amount of money and you don't expect to walk out with it.

2154
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're okay.

2155
02:17:11,701 --> 02:17:13,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, not that I should be endorsing gambling.

2156
02:17:14,163 --> 02:17:18,406
[SPEAKER_09]: But once in a while, it's not gonna... It's okay.

2157
02:17:18,606 --> 02:17:19,006
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you...

2158
02:17:20,302 --> 02:17:22,903
[SPEAKER_09]: People know their tolerance is the best for themselves.

2159
02:17:24,504 --> 02:17:25,484
[SPEAKER_09]: The Skype lines are open.

2160
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:26,945
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2161
02:17:27,025 --> 02:17:28,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Use name on Skype as Orange Launch Radio.

2162
02:17:28,726 --> 02:17:32,347
[SPEAKER_09]: While we wait to see if we get any more calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us otherwise?

2163
02:17:32,687 --> 02:17:34,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still reading more of that wiki.

2164
02:17:34,728 --> 02:17:37,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, there's one thing here that's kind of funny.

2165
02:17:38,010 --> 02:17:45,753
[SPEAKER_10]: On Machima.com, they have a video for... You know how they have all those meet the classes of characters in Team Fortress 2?

2166
02:17:45,893 --> 02:17:46,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they have Meet the Cow.

2167
02:17:48,355 --> 02:17:55,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's some cardboard cow or some wood cutout cow that's in Team Fortress 2 and it's pretty funny.

2168
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:57,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we have another call.

2169
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the phones.

2170
02:17:58,761 --> 02:17:59,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2171
02:17:59,742 --> 02:18:00,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is this?

2172
02:18:01,743 --> 02:18:04,064
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the one from Sweden.

2173
02:18:04,725 --> 02:18:06,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Our Swedish friend.

2174
02:18:06,706 --> 02:18:10,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I was hoping you'd call tonight with all the ABBA references we were making earlier in the show.

2175
02:18:10,809 --> 02:18:12,590
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just... What's that?

2176
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:15,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't about that, though, but...

2177
02:18:17,045 --> 02:18:18,566
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright, I'm just messing with you.

2178
02:18:18,766 --> 02:18:19,486
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2179
02:18:22,148 --> 02:18:29,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the system specs for Age of Reckoning Warhammer has finally been released.

2180
02:18:29,232 --> 02:18:33,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you actually did mention it, but it has been released.

2181
02:18:33,515 --> 02:18:34,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us a little bit about it.

2182
02:18:36,517 --> 02:18:42,560
[SPEAKER_07]: The system specs for Warhammer Online has been released, which is a basic single-core...

2183
02:18:44,738 --> 02:18:56,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Pentium 4, 2.4, and mostly like a gig of RAM if you run AXP or Vista.

2184
02:18:56,883 --> 02:18:58,584
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're running Vista, you need two.

2185
02:18:59,524 --> 02:19:05,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, you need an average modern video card, and you're ready to go.

2186
02:19:07,888 --> 02:19:11,489
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like most anyone can run this if you have a modern PC.

2187
02:19:11,529 --> 02:19:11,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2188
02:19:13,749 --> 02:19:22,273
[SPEAKER_07]: since they're aiming for basically the WoW scale of players.

2189
02:19:24,074 --> 02:19:41,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I'm quite a bit surprised since, at least in my case, I'm running really on a, as current state, unfortunately a big low generation 7 GeForce card.

2190
02:19:41,866 --> 02:19:43,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And that one isn't supported.

2191
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:57,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And the funny thing is that mostly low ATI cards are supported, but the NVIDIA ones are not.

2192
02:19:57,665 --> 02:19:57,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah.

2193
02:20:24,611 --> 02:20:25,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not quitting Ragnarok.

2194
02:20:25,792 --> 02:20:26,852
[SPEAKER_09]: All the cool kids are quitting their games.

2195
02:20:26,872 --> 02:20:27,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

2196
02:20:51,894 --> 02:21:01,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, pardon me, but I'm not that big a fan of a Star Trek geek, so I can't really say anything.

2197
02:21:01,660 --> 02:21:20,693
[SPEAKER_07]: The only space science fiction MMO I played for a while was EVE Online, which, well, is sort of fun, even though if you're really out of breaking down on EVE, just on the EVE front, it's basically a big Excel spreadsheet, so...

2198
02:21:21,972 --> 02:21:22,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2199
02:21:22,512 --> 02:21:26,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf says in chat right now, I want to join Rob's fleet in Star Trek Online.

2200
02:21:26,455 --> 02:21:27,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I'm going to have a fleet.

2201
02:21:27,876 --> 02:21:28,717
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be great.

2202
02:21:29,217 --> 02:21:31,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I want to be Captain Sassy Pants.

2203
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:34,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

2204
02:21:35,841 --> 02:21:38,343
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

2205
02:21:38,563 --> 02:21:40,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Captain Sassy Pants of the USS OLR.

2206
02:21:40,885 --> 02:21:41,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

2207
02:21:41,565 --> 02:21:42,166
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting off track.

2208
02:21:42,186 --> 02:21:44,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you didn't want to talk about Star Trek because you're not that big a geek.

2209
02:21:44,467 --> 02:21:46,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

2210
02:21:46,629 --> 02:21:46,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

2211
02:21:47,749 --> 02:21:49,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, finish your thought.

2212
02:21:49,570 --> 02:21:56,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, I've had the opportunity to try out Age of Conan.

2213
02:21:57,152 --> 02:22:03,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, I'm not that impressed, really.

2214
02:22:03,874 --> 02:22:06,014
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't cyber with anyone in the game, did you?

2215
02:22:07,055 --> 02:22:09,515
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I didn't.

2216
02:22:10,476 --> 02:22:12,576
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like you didn't think it was too high.

2217
02:22:12,836 --> 02:22:14,017
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you not enjoy about it?

2218
02:22:14,397 --> 02:22:14,937
[SPEAKER_09]: What turned you off?

2219
02:22:16,397 --> 02:22:23,980
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is the combat system that it's, well, it's weird.

2220
02:22:25,101 --> 02:22:28,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe just I need to learn to play, really.

2221
02:22:31,384 --> 02:22:34,565
[SPEAKER_09]: The combat system wasn't saved by the fact that you could lob people's heads off?

2222
02:22:36,646 --> 02:22:39,988
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't lob any heads off, I think.

2223
02:22:42,409 --> 02:22:44,650
[SPEAKER_07]: But it might be also due to the following fact that I'm

2224
02:22:46,128 --> 02:22:51,100
[SPEAKER_07]: My computer that I'm running Ejikonan on is really a lowest

2225
02:22:52,165 --> 02:22:55,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get a lot of the high end stuff as we get it here?

2226
02:22:55,968 --> 02:22:57,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do you find that you guys lag behind a little bit?

2227
02:23:20,194 --> 02:23:22,596
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we don't like behind at all.

2228
02:23:22,856 --> 02:23:29,721
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just me that don't have the possibility to dish out.

2229
02:23:31,142 --> 02:23:31,562
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know.

2230
02:23:31,802 --> 02:23:32,683
[SPEAKER_09]: We're poor here, too.

2231
02:23:32,743 --> 02:23:33,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm poor.

2232
02:23:34,003 --> 02:23:37,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I am going to probably dish out the money because I did a second job recently.

2233
02:23:37,666 --> 02:23:38,066
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

2234
02:23:39,948 --> 02:23:44,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you have the opportunity, you can...

2235
02:23:46,356 --> 02:23:54,743
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really easy to dish out a few bucks, so you can get a respectable gaming system, so it's no problem at all.

2236
02:23:55,644 --> 02:23:57,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hey, we've got to let you go, buddy.

2237
02:23:57,846 --> 02:24:01,769
[SPEAKER_09]: We're running out of time, but thanks so much for your call, as always, and letting us know how the weather is on the other side of the pond.

2238
02:24:02,890 --> 02:24:03,971
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate it.

2239
02:24:04,071 --> 02:24:04,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

2240
02:24:06,098 --> 02:24:11,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line and take any other last minute stories we have here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2241
02:24:11,803 --> 02:24:17,768
[SPEAKER_09]: We have something else we're trying to get to live tonight just for the live folks on allgames.com so anything else you guys have tonight?

2242
02:24:18,349 --> 02:24:19,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could read German.

2243
02:24:20,273 --> 02:24:21,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching.

2244
02:24:21,114 --> 02:24:21,674
[SPEAKER_09]: See you next time.

2245
02:24:40,146 --> 02:24:44,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes about 15 minutes to load, but it's supposedly worth it.

2246
02:24:45,547 --> 02:24:46,127
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do it.

2247
02:24:46,167 --> 02:24:47,167
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to wrap up the show.

2248
02:24:47,208 --> 02:24:48,848
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

2249
02:24:48,908 --> 02:24:49,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, we'll start with you.

2250
02:24:49,708 --> 02:24:50,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Your final thought.

2251
02:24:50,728 --> 02:24:51,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait to play this game.

2252
02:24:52,989 --> 02:24:54,069
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2253
02:24:54,669 --> 02:24:58,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we are so going to see Journey, Heart, and Cheap Trick.

2254
02:24:59,230 --> 02:25:00,450
[SPEAKER_02]: That's freaking awesome.

2255
02:25:01,551 --> 02:25:08,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And my final thought is I want to quote a Journey song, but not Don't Stop Believin'.

2256
02:25:10,194 --> 02:25:12,416
[SPEAKER_02]: When the lights go down in the city.

2257
02:25:12,536 --> 02:25:14,277
[SPEAKER_09]: When the lights go down.

2258
02:25:14,317 --> 02:25:14,898
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that'll work.

2259
02:25:14,918 --> 02:25:16,399
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, have a good one, you guys.

2260
02:25:16,419 --> 02:25:19,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting.

2261
02:25:19,462 --> 02:25:19,902
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2262
02:25:19,922 --> 02:25:21,723
[SPEAKER_09]: We wouldn't be here without your guys' support.

2263
02:25:22,324 --> 02:25:25,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, all we ask, if you like our show, tell a couple friends about the show.

2264
02:25:26,127 --> 02:25:30,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Leave us some positive reviews out there on the internet on your favorite podcasting website like iTunes or Dig or what have you.

2265
02:25:31,131 --> 02:25:35,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Help us spread the word because we're pretty stretched for resources here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2266
02:25:36,215 --> 02:25:38,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, there will be no live show next week.

2267
02:25:38,117 --> 02:25:39,638
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hoping to have something taped for you guys
