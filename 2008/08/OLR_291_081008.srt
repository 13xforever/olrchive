Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Roto.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, August 10th, 2008, Ozzy Osbourne gets ready to rock Guitar Hero,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Sega admits to sonic errors, and Grand Theft Auto 4 PC is announced to no one's surprise.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are that video game independent podcast on the internet,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'm one of the three hosts here on Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The other co-hosts, with me as always, say hello to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yo.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How you doing, Jamie Summers?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A little warm.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, this is a little warm in studio tonight.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Not terrible, thank god, compared to weeks past.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm having geek issues.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Geek issues?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Geek drama? What type of geek drama?

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, no, I'm just trying to figure out, essentially, how to move over my ringtones and stuff from my laptop,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
iTunes, to my PC, so that I can start syncing my iPhone from my PC.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, I thought, before the show, you were talking this whole thing about Linux.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I thought your geek issues had to do with Linux, not the phone.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, it does. It does, because I've decided that instead of using my PC, putting another drive on my PC,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm going to reformat my laptop to Linux Mint.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nice.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So that I can play with it and not have to worry about the Franken-VIO going, ugh.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Is it minty fresh?

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You saw it.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, it looks, it looks fresh.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's pretty and useful.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Remember when fresh was a word used to describe cool things?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's fresh.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Or crescent fresh? Any Ciffol and Ollie fans in the house?

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hey, the one and only tech master, Loki. How you doing, Loki?

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm doing fine.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you feeling fresh?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I was fresh until this fucking pizza dripped on me.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So now you're not so fresh?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No. See, this is, I think it's the curse for having white shorts.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Ah, it's inevitable.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's because, it's like, it's a magnet for shit.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Seriously, it's just like, everything's fine.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All of a sudden, like, a rogue drop of something will hit, you know, the shorts and...

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's all downhill for us.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, it's a good thing we don't have a webcam.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh wait, we do, over at JustinTV slash Orange Lounge Radio.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But the good news is, Loki's pants are obscured by the laptop of his and the, so you can't see anything.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's too dark in here tonight because we have the lights off for the heat, so...

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's just a drop.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I mean, it's just a drop.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's like, oh, pizza all over me, I'm so stupid, I can't eat.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We'll also present our always present fourth guest on the show, you, in our chat room,

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
when you join us live on All Games Radio at AllGames.com,

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
when we tape Sunday nights right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Although, as of late, Bobby's been running over, eating up our time slot a little bit.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, we forgive him, because he always has us on at the end of the show anyway.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, you can always check that out on All Games Radio, live on Sunday nights.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And SSJ100Matt is quoting from Ciffololli, calls, calls, calls, calls from the public, calls.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Anyway, we always love having our chat room on board and the regulars,

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and always some new faces, so please feel free to stop by our chat room,

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com, while we are taking live calls and during chat hours

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
when we're taping live on Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All right, let's start off the show as we always do.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How is your gaming week, the types of games you have or haven't been playing this week?

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Maybe if you haven't been playing any games, then what you wish you were playing, dark soccer.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I actually really didn't, because I had the most craptastic week ever,

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and I had a final, but now that I'm done with school.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I found out, though, that I don't have to report for jury duty,

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
so I won't be able to play my Game Boy when I'm supposed to be at work.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No Phoenix Wright for reals?

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I really wanted to get on a trial. I really wanted to get on a trial.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It is fascinating stuff. Everybody should do it at least once in their life.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I want to be civic-dutied. Anyway, however, I do actually,

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I did sit down and start playing Oh And On a little bit more,

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and I'm still playing Aurora Faint on my iPhone, which is craptastic.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That game is fun. And Sudoku. And Ragnarok.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Rag to crack.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I noticed that when you were showing me the Linux Mint,

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think you seemed to be very excited, because there was a picture of it

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
flipping between two windows, both of which had Ragnarok on them.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Part of the deciding factor for me having a Linux boot

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
is if I can play Ragnarok on line item or not.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So is that so you can run your storefront in one window,

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and so you can quest in the other? Is that what it is?

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, no, because I play on private servers. All I have to do is auto trade.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, I see.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And it'll vend while I am gone.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But no, it's just so that I really want something that runs a lot,

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
well, it runs a lot more efficiently.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I just need to make sure that my system is going to be okay with it

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
for me to make the switch.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And right now I have to figure out, because I've tried doing this before,

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
trying to get my iTunes, my ringtones and contacts and everything

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
to sync on my newer computer.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And so far iTunes said, ah, fuck it.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So as soon as I get that to work, I can reinstall on my laptop

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and see how that goes.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, I am considering upgrading the computer here in studio, actually.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to talk more about next week's plan in just a minute,

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
but since it's likely we're not going to be here with the show next week,

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm thinking about taking the time to upgrade the computer here in studio

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
because I have my eyes on some quad core systems and some fancy stuff.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, you can tell it's old because it's that off-white color

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
because all the computers nowadays are black.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, they're black now.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Black is the new off-white.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Exactly.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Anything else?

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It also doesn't have a window and excessive lights in it.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Anything else you want to share about your gaming week, DarkSagra?

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
My annoyments with my husband because he still hasn't got me

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to The World Ends With You, and he was supposed to, and he didn't.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Liar.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have it with me if you wish to play it during the break.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There was a whole lot of GTA-ing going on in the house.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But you still won all to yourself.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The World Ends With You for you.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, I do. For me.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
For you.

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
To have.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Comments in chat.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
DreadLockLord says, Sky, get an Alienware,

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and SGA100Matt says, Alienware is overpriced.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Just build one from scratch.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Exactly.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm thinking of doing the scratch thing,

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
but damn, there are some good deals in those package systems.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It is so tempting.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Newegg.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm thinking about it.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's not.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I am actually, oh, God, I hate to.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm gonna get so many nerdy emails from nerds everywhere that say I'm stupid,

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but I'm actually, I have my eye on a gateway.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's really cheap, and it's really good.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I only bought a gateway.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Listen, I know this is radio, but I just got the look of shame, like, twice.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Listen, I have a gateway laptop.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's because you can't build a laptop from scratch.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And trust me, I looked.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I was going to build one from scratch, even if it's the ugliest piece of shit thing ever.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
As long as I built it from scratch.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But no, I got this because it was an open box, and it was just,

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Bryce was right at the time, so.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Actually, I have a, one of my friends does a little bit of laptop tweaking

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and can build a Mac as long as it has the right hardware in it.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I got my iBook.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's enough Mac for me, for the house.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm actually, as soon as I get money set aside for it,

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm having him help me with building a Mac from scratch.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What kind of hardware is required?

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
A heating element for toast?

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You know what, I want a Mac because I deal with artsy stuff all the time,

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and I need it, so, shut up.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I'll tell you what, having edited movies on PC and Mac now,

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
it's so much easier on the Mac.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It is so much easier to edit movies on the Mac.

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Anyhow, look.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Not every computer is meant for games, duh.

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Back to games for a minute.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
My gaming week was alright.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I didn't play too much.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Had my eye on.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I was trying to catch up with stuff that I meant to play.

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This week I did check out Braid because I was like,

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
hmm, I haven't made a random purchase online yet.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Random!

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There you go.

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Buy that.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So I bought it.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think, you know, because the big thing right now is that

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
$15 isn't worth it.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think everyone's kind of not really concerned whether this game's worth $15,

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
but when these games that are $15 start selling,

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Microsoft goes, oh, so they'll pay $15.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, we're going to make all of them $15, and now $20.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, they'll pay $20.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We'll make them all $20, and now $25.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's like the price of gasoline.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I was just saying something about this the other day.

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You know how gas prices have been coming down lately,

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and it's about, what, $3.90 a gallon locally now?

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And everybody's going, hooray, gas is under $4 a gallon, hooray.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I'm like, that's what they want you to think.

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
They want you to think you're getting a good deal,

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
but you've got to remember a year ago it was $2.90,

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and even that was high.

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So don't buy into that.

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Exactly, and that's what's going on with this,

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
is I think the gamers are trying to tell Microsoft,

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
hey, listen, we're going to buy this game,

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
but we don't expect all these games to be $15,

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and we're not going to fucking buy all of them.

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And all that being said, I think Braid is worth $15.

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Absolutely.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I would say it's worth $10, but that's about it.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And the only reason, because it's quick.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I mean, I know you said you had a little bit of problems with it.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Because I'm stupid, and it takes me a long time

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to figure out these puzzles.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm almost all the way through the game,

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and it's only been about two hours,

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and it's just, I mean, there's some of the puzzles

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
later on are a little bit tricky,

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
but the first few ones I kind of figured out

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
what they want me to do really quick.

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I kind of look back at this and like,

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
okay, there's going to be speed runs you can do

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
throughout the game, but that's really the only replayability.

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Quickly though, because I knew nothing about Braid,

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
absolutely zilch about this game.

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think I might have heard it mentioned

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
like out of a game developer's conference once or twice,

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
but about the game itself, I knew nothing about it

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
except that it was supposedly this really critically acclaimed game

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
until I got my hands on it this week.

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So for those of our listeners who have no Xbox 360,

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
what is this game all about?

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I want to hear the low-key version of this.

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's about this dude who's going around

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and being all emo about the fact that he lost somebody

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and he's like searching for something.

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
To be honest, it's like, text, text, text,

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm walking past it all, you know.

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But, yeah, thank God he can bypass the story.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I read it, okay, but I was just like,

231
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
okay, my whole thing is there's one of them

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
that sounds like he had a wife or something

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
but now he's going after some other chick

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and he left her to go find this old flame or princess or whatever,

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and I'm thinking, you're just going to realize

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
that you lost your wife because you're an idiot.

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But then at the same time, this guy is some crazy dude

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that's got a tie in walking through this world

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
that's a rip-off of Super Mario Brothers, you know.

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But the game is nothing like Super Mario Brothers.

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's the thing, though, I know.

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But at the same time, it is, I don't know,

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
it's got really cool, unique gameplay elements to it.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You know, Portal could take notice of this,

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and maybe this would be perfect for, you know, Portal 2.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But, I don't know.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There are some things, though, that I did read

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
that there's eight hidden stars in the game,

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
which may unlock some more stuff later,

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
which would be kind of cool.

251
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But there's just, once you're done with the game,

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't see it really going, I guess it's like Portal a little bit,

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you know, you don't really go back.

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But they built the speedrun thing into it,

255
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the speedrun contest, which I thought was kind of interesting.

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Like, once you beat it once, you can go through and do the speedruns,

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
but I'm too stupid to beat it even once.

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I mean, this game makes you feel like a dummy.

259
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
At least, if you're me.

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But there's a certain factor when you're playing through the game, at least.

261
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't know about you, but there were certain puzzles

262
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that were frustrating the hell out of me.

263
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Like, I was getting in that whole, like, old school,

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
like, I'm gonna throw the Nintendo controller at the screen mode.

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But when I solved it, I was like,

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
yes, I'm awesome, I solved the puzzle, you know what I mean?

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like, there was definitely some rewards to it.

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I've actually not used any online game facts

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
or anything like that to get through the game.

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I've just been playing it normal and just trying to figure out.

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're smart! You got more pieces than I do.

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, you know, I'm also trying to be a completist,

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
so I won't continue on until,

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
unless that last level, because I got pissed off with it,

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
so I just ran all the way through it.

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, I just ran all the way through all the levels once,

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and then I went back and tried to beat them.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But, you know, I don't know.

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It would be cooler if it was longer.

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hopefully they'll have some download stuff later,

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
because that would be pretty cool for it.

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Anyways, enough with Braid.

283
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I also played this week the demo for Battle Fantasia,

284
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
which is like this weird medieval anime fighting game type thing.

285
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It was okay. I don't know.

286
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I've heard about that game. What do you think of it?

287
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's pretty. I mean, it's all 3D and stuff.

288
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But it was alright.

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They have two characters you can play as.

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
One has this chainsaw thing,

291
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and the other guy is this little kid in knight's armor,

292
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and he's fighting and stuff.

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's alright. I'm not really in the fighting game,

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
so it was just okay for me.

295
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But, you know, it's pretty.

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It looks a lot better than I thought it would.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you're looking for another game to pick up,

298
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
other than maybe Soul Calibur IV or something like that,

299
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
this you might like.

300
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Check it out.

301
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then Grand Theft Auto IV.

302
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I also got my 360 back from Microsoft being repaired.

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It was actually really quick, which I was surprised.

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So that went pretty well.

305
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I kept the old box just in case another one dies,

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
so for a track record it's been like 5 out of 6,

307
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
or 7 if you include the new one I bought.

308
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So, yeah, that's about it.

309
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm definitely looking forward to this week for Bionaut Commando.

310
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, is that this week?

311
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's this week.

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, that should be fun.

313
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Xbox did a good thing with this whole Xbox Live Arcade for August,

314
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
because between Geometry Wars 2 last week,

315
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
which I'm still playing,

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and Braid this week, I'm busy.

317
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I've barely been touching Soul Calibur.

318
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I think the only time I played Soul Calibur at all this week

319
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
was when one of the listeners wanted to do some fighting,

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
which I did.

321
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah, I didn't get to play a lot this week,

322
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
because I was actually...

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm sorry, I felt bad,

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
because another listener wanted to battle me,

325
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and I was too into Braid.

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I just ignored all the messages that were popping up,

327
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and I'm like, oh, I should go look at them.

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, the poor guy wants to play Soul Calibur,

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and here I am all sucked into Braid.

330
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know, this week I didn't get to play a lot,

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
because I was doing some video editing

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
for something I'm making for work,

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and I also didn't get to work on the PSP website at all,

334
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
but it's coming along, I promise.

335
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm just working on a bunch of small stuff, unfortunately,

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and then maybe I'll try to finish the bigger stuff first.

337
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know.

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's it.

339
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I've been looking a lot at Singets Row 2, though.

340
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I mean, the more stuff I see for it, the cooler it looks,

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and I'm really excited to play that game.

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
All right.

343
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
My Gaming Week, as I already mentioned,

344
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Braid, I think Braid is absolutely worth it.

345
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm sure $15 is fine.

346
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want to refrain from trying to use the Penny Arcade argument

347
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
that they posted earlier this week about the whole,

348
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
well, you'll spend $15 on a shirt,

349
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
so why not spend $15 on a game?

350
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm taking a different approach,

351
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and if you were listening to Bobby's show a minute ago,

352
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm going to use the same thing,

353
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
so I apologize to our listeners live who were hearing it twice,

354
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
but, you know, I went and saw The Dark Knight,

355
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and I paid $10 to see The Dark Knight,

356
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
because movie prices are insane right now,

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and that's not even counting the price of an IC

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and candy and all that shit,

359
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
so I paid $10 to see The Dark Knight,

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
which entertained me for two and a half hours,

361
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and Braid's already entertained me that long,

362
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you know, just through the little bit I've played of it.

363
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I know people that have gone to see The Dark Knight three times,

364
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
meaning they've paid $30 to see the same two and a half hours.

365
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't get me wrong.

366
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm not bashing The Dark Knight, great movie,

367
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
but why is it okay to spend $30 there,

368
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
but yet $15 feels like such a ripoff?

369
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Because it's apples and oranges.

370
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I get what you're saying.

371
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I completely understand what you're saying about the whole,

372
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
you don't want to set a precedent for Microsoft,

373
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
because especially the fact that, okay,

374
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
then there's games like Fusion Frenzy 2 that cost, what, $50,

375
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that entertained me for 30 seconds,

376
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
the amount of time for the logo to get on and off the screen.

377
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's a retarded argument.

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I understand what Penny Arcade was trying to say,

379
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
but it's fucking a retarded argument.

380
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh, snap, all right.

381
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, well, let's go to Disneyland,

382
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
because you can spend a day there that's, you know,

383
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
about eight hours, and you spend $100,

384
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
so let's charge $100 for every fucking online game,

385
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
because it's, you know, over eight hours of entertainment.

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's retarded.

387
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
However, however, however,

388
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can absolutely disprove that there's any validity to that argument,

389
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
because going to Disneyland is like paying for 30 MMOs.

390
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah, and going to Disneyland has Space Mountain.

391
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
End of story.

392
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
End of argument.

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And California Screamin'.

394
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
All right, fine, you pay $50 for, you know, console games.

395
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Why can't you pay $50 for this online game?

396
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I know it's only, you know, six hours long or eight hours long,

397
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
but some console games, because they suck,

398
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
are only eight hours long as well.

399
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And some, and to be honest,

400
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
this may actually have a little bit more polish

401
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
than some of the stuff that ends up on the Wii.

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
For real.

403
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's what I'm saying.

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's why I'm like, $15 is not a bad price,

405
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but I do agree, we don't want to set a precedent,

406
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
but I think those games that are $15 that are crap

407
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
are not going to sell.

408
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Like, look at some of the, like that Sudoku game,

409
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and the, no, no, the Crosswords game.

410
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Wasn't that like 10 bucks?

411
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Has anybody, a quick, quick poll in chat, folks,

412
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
chat.ownerslonsradio.com,

413
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
did anyone drop 10 bucks on that Crossword game?

414
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's what I want to know.

415
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Did you really need the achievement points that bad?

416
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't be shy.

417
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This is a real needy survey,

418
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
because I want to know if anyone dropped $10 on that game.

419
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Now, because it wasn't worth it,

420
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and it sends a message.

421
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And I do give them props for having demos for this stuff,

422
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
which is nice.

423
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's what they really need to do,

424
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
because there's some companies, Nintendo,

425
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
that don't put demos for their games up there,

426
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and so you buy it, and you're like,

427
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
wow, this sucks.

428
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Can I get my money back?

429
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No?

430
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, well, fuck you.

431
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm not buying anymore.

432
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't know, it's just,

433
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about it,

434
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
because games like this are going to sell well,

435
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and they're going to say,

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
hey, people are going to be willing to pay this kind of money,

437
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
so let's raise the price.

438
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, well, we'll just use the excuse that my game's,

439
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
you know, small, and I'm an independent publisher,

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and if you don't buy my game at $15,

441
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't make any money.

442
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Or, you know, oh, you know,

443
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
development costs are going up more,

444
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and oh, we need more money for this stuff.

445
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Dude, I mean, development costs for a game,

446
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
no offense, the art style's awesome,

447
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the engine's pretty cool, you know,

448
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm sure that took some time,

449
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
but seriously, there's like,

450
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
they're goombas, okay?

451
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
They're piranha plants.

452
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
There's so much more to it than that.

453
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
All right, look, we're just going to have to disagree.

454
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That happens sometimes when you have three people on a show.

455
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I say it's worth it, and go spend the money right now.

456
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Nintendo will sue.

457
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I think it's...

458
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Nintendo has nothing to sue over.

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The game is, it's an homage to Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong

460
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and other games.

461
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What if, in fact, did you notice

462
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
that the Donkey Kong level was called Jumpman,

463
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
which is Mario's name in Donkey Kong?

464
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.

465
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There are these subtle little...

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What about stories, right?

467
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
All right, sorry, look.

468
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We have to have an argument.

469
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm telling you, Dark Soccer,

470
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
you really need to check out Braid.

471
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You really do.

472
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I planned on it, and actually...

473
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We need a third opinion.

474
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I added Major Nelson to my Twitter,

475
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and so he put up a download code up for it.

476
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Did you get it?

477
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No, I didn't. I was at work.

478
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, then somebody else did cry.

479
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I'm just saying, you know,

480
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
if anyone wants to check out some of these games,

481
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
you know, for free as they come up,

482
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
he's doing crap like this all the time on Twitter.

483
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Just pray you're first.

484
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Seriously.

485
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
All right, results of our quick poll in chat.

486
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Did anyone buy the crosswords game?

487
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
No, no, nope, what, hell no, no, no.

488
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I didn't even know there was a crossword game.

489
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Flash games, anyone?

490
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Nope, hell no, no, and so on.

491
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So I didn't see anyone say yes.

492
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, just kind of throwing that out there.

493
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
All right, the rest of my gaming week,

494
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Geometry Wars 2, WoW, Soul Calibur,

495
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
pretty much nothing else new besides Braid.

496
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But that's okay,

497
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
because Braid was a worthwhile expenditure this week.

498
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay, that's it for my gaming week.

499
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's get into tonight's housekeeping.

500
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
My Vegas trip I talked about last week got canceled

501
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
due to personal reasons, nothing bad.

502
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's just, didn't end up being able to do it.

503
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So, but we're still,

504
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
because some of us kind of banked on there

505
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
not being a show next week,

506
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
we may still not be here,

507
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
just especially because like a week or two before PAX,

508
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
we might just kind of take the week off anyway.

509
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com for the details.

510
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We'll keep you guys posted

511
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
if we end up doing anything pre-taped,

512
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
which looks likely or not,

513
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
but we probably will not be live next week,

514
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
but you never know,

515
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
just stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com.

516
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's pretty much that as far as the show goes.

517
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I do want to say, though,

518
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I thought it was very cool,

519
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
even though I am not going to end up

520
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
getting to go to Vegas,

521
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and I'm going to miss the Star Trek experience,

522
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I did have a listener email me,

523
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and I'm sorry, I don't have my email open,

524
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
so I forgot your name,

525
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
but he mentioned that he and his,

526
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and I forget if it was girlfriend or wife,

527
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I think he said wife,

528
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
or future wife or something,

529
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
said that because I mentioned it on the show,

530
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
they bumped up their trip.

531
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
They didn't realize the Star Trek experience

532
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
was closing and got to go,

533
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
so I just thought that was awesome.

534
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That made me feel really warm and fuzzy

535
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
about the power of this show

536
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
to help out nerds everywhere.

537
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Live long and prosper, my friend.

538
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Have fun, you guys.

539
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The other housekeeping thing I wanted to say,

540
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
iTunes reviews.

541
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Please be so kind to leave us

542
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
a five-star review on iTunes.

543
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Just search for Orange Launch Radio.

544
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Leave us a nice review.

545
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll be posting the link in chat shortly

546
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
if you guys would be so kind to post some reviews.

547
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We would heart that very muchly.

548
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It helps, because the more positive reviews,

549
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
it helps the ranking.

550
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The higher the ranking,

551
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
the more likely people are to find us,

552
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and nothing against the shows that are all top-rated,

553
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
but 80% of them are commercial,

554
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
like G4, 1UP, GameSpot-style casts

555
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
that don't need that attention.

556
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
They have TV stations and websites and magazines

557
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that back them.

558
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They don't need it.

559
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You know what's also sick?

560
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What?

561
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Some of those websites, like IGN,

562
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
run like eight podcasts.

563
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Dude.

564
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And they're all in the top 20.

565
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I know.

566
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Seriously.

567
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I know.

568
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
They need eight podcasts.

569
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
All right.

570
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Anyhow.

571
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
To answer Quel Tipo,

572
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
what we endorse is free thought.

573
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What did Quel Tipo say?

574
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Waterboarding.

575
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What the hell is that?

576
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I have no idea,

577
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
but I'm just saying we endorse thinking for yourself.

578
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Waterboarding is where you pour water over someone's face

579
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
when you're interrogating them,

580
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and it gives them the sensation of drowning,

581
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and apparently is some big controversy

582
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
going on in the government,

583
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
because they do that, too.

584
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh, okay.

585
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

586
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I do remember reading a politically oriented story on that now.

587
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
However, what we endorse is thinking for yourself

588
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and acting responsibly within the confines

589
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
of your own concept of morality.

590
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Does that work?

591
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Mm-hmm.

592
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Okay.

593
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Do that.

594
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
All right.

595
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Let's move on.

596
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Ice Cream Man.

597
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Give me...

598
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Hold on.

599
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
We have to pause the show.

600
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We hear an ice cream truck.

601
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
All right.

602
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Loki.

603
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Ice Cream Man does not have that kind of base.

604
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

605
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's the gangsta.

606
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Ice Cream Man.

607
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Although if I had an ice cream truck, you know...

608
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Loki, gaming news.

609
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Let's get to it.

610
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If you are an attractive person looking for a cool game,

611
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
well, you'll be happy to know that tomorrow,

612
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
or Monday, August 11th,

613
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
the first episode of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People,

614
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Homestar Ruiner, will be coming out,

615
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and that'll be available on WiiWare and PC,

616
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and that's exciting.

617
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

618
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That is very exciting.

619
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Sorry.

620
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Comment and chat.

621
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Kadosho says, yay, ice cream truck.

622
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It has 150 hit points.

623
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Suma says, so in other words,

624
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
OLR supports torture?

625
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
No.

626
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
We just support people thinking for themselves

627
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and doing whatever they feel is morally and ethically correct.

628
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Well, some of these past episodes that we've done, well...

629
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Anyhow, Strong Bad.

630
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You excited about the Strong Bad game?

631
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
No.

632
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I never was one into, you know, Homestar Ruiner.

633
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
All right, then screw you.

634
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Dark Soccer, I know you like Homestar Ruiner.

635
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You gonna check out the game?

636
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Hell yeah.

637
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm a cool and attractive person.

638
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Are you gonna download it on PC, Rob?

639
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Since obviously you're...

640
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yes, I will check it out on PC since I'm having issues.

641
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm gonna get a WiiWare.

642
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Which is a bummer because somebody I know is...

643
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I don't know how much I should say,

644
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
but I should be getting the Wii one,

645
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
but I'm not.

646
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm gonna get the PC one.

647
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm still supporting it one way or the other,

648
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and I get to revisit.

649
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Here's the thing.

650
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I haven't even watched Homestar Ruiner in like two years,

651
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
so it's kind of one of those,

652
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
oh, it's revisiting an old friend.

653
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So that's my plan.

654
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I demand an Ask A Ninja game.

655
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You'll never...

656
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We'll see. We'll see.

657
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Someday.

658
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Alright.

659
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So there it is.

660
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Check that out next week.

661
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Meanwhile, or Monday even.

662
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You don't even have to wait a week.

663
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Meanwhile, also on the Wii,

664
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Rock Band 2, and apparently they are saying that

665
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Rock Band 2 is not gonna hold back on any of the features

666
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
that you know from the other Rock Band games,

667
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
meaning like download content.

668
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Hello, that's something the first Rock Band was sorely missing.

669
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
They had to put the bonus songs on the disc

670
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and call it like a bonus exclusive.

671
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Apparently, you're gonna be able to download songs,

672
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
do the whole online thing,

673
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
make your own rocker, drummer, whatever.

674
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Apparently, this is coming from Wired magazine.

675
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Wired is saying that the Wii version of Rock Band 2

676
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
is going to be, and this is right out of Harmonix's mouth,

677
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
fully featured DLC online play.

678
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's going to be a much more competitive product.

679
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Do they know something we don't?

680
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I know, exactly.

681
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm kind of curious to see what magic little thing

682
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
is gonna be implemented between now and whenever

683
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
this game comes out.

684
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
November?

685
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So, very interesting.

686
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But good news for Wii owners,

687
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
especially those that want to have Rock Band,

688
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
if you didn't pony up the money for an Xbox or PlayStation 3

689
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and this is all you got in your house,

690
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
you won't experience Rock Band,

691
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm glad to hear, finally, you won't be getting held back.

692
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
No, this is not, wasn't in our show role,

693
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
but I was gonna mention it anyways,

694
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
because there was supposedly the information that

695
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Rock Band 2's release dates got leaked, apparently.

696
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think we are talking about that in part B tonight.

697
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh, we are?

698
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You are, actually.

699
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I am, yes.

700
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I didn't see it on there.

701
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So stay tuned.

702
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh.

703
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's there.

704
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Nevermind.

705
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
We'll talk about it later on.

706
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm jumping ahead.

707
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
See, we have to tease them with something for later.

708
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So, we'll just have to go, we'll have to go back in time

709
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
for now, right, Darksyra?

710
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Well, you ready to do the time warp?

711
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Because we've been time warping all over this story.

712
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's just a jump to the left.

713
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
What was it?

714
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Remember what we saw at Margaret Cho,

715
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
talking about her mother going to see Rocky?

716
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Games!

717
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Darksyra Games.

718
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Alright, well, Mega Man 9, as we know,

719
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
is going to be nest-tastic.

720
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
However, you've got an option to make it even more nest-tastic.

721
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You can make it flicker.

722
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That's right.

723
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You can make it flicker as a built-in bug in the game

724
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
if you so choose to activate it.

725
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So, for anyone who is so young that they don't know what flicker is,

726
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
this is a good way to discover what we grew up with.

727
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
This is awesome, too, because, like, you know,

728
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
companies like EA and Ubisoft and stuff like that

729
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
tend to release games that have a few glitches.

730
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh, don't worry.

731
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It was intentional for your save to get deleted.

732
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's retro.

733
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You like retro.

734
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Well, in this case, you can select if you want it on or off.

735
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But it's also saying that there's going to be other types of glitches

736
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
that you would commonly find.

737
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Because, you know, I found the glitch in Mega Man 3 by myself

738
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
where you can kill yourself, you jump down a hole,

739
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and then you hold the left and right buttons

740
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
so that you do the super jump and you lose all of your life

741
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and you can't shoot anything, but you can still use your weapons

742
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
because you're invincible.

743
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Because you're dead.

744
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You're undead Mega Man.

745
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I have to say this from chat because this kind of goes along with the story.

746
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
ActDef says Mega Man 9 will have flickers and bugs.

747
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yay for Ness.

748
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Why is this exciting news that we're going to have bugs in the game?

749
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Well, granted, they're optional, but why is this exciting?

750
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's something that you can pick.

751
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Because the whole purpose of the game is to have the experience

752
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
of playing one of the old 8-bit versions of a Mega Man game,

753
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
which technically that's what it is.

754
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You can have it the way the other ones were.

755
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You can have it the way the other ones were if you want to.

756
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Why complain about something that you can turn on or off?

757
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That earns you the STFU award.

758
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Thank you very much. Drive-thru, please.

759
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's not really so much that, but the fact that it's like,

760
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
OMG news, you know what I mean?

761
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I think it is newsworthy.

762
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's interesting. I'll give it that.

763
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I think that it's basically everyone's excited about the attention to details like that.

764
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I could see that. I could give it that.

765
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I still say?

766
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Fine.

767
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That's what I say.

768
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So noted.

769
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Well, put that on the OLR Wiki, please.

770
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The Dark Soccer's official statement on this episode is...

771
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Well, one series that's been known for a few glitches, at least.

772
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
In fact, a glitch-themed musical number that was released on the Internet.

773
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Saints Row.

774
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Well, Saints Row 2 will not be coming to the Wii,

775
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
which is not surprising.

776
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Basically, the concerns are over controversy that a game like that may cause,

777
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and also the fact that the graphics on the Wii aren't exactly what they are on the Xbox 360.

778
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
They basically are worried that because if you had Wii controls for, like,

779
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
chainsaws and satchel charges and stuff like that in the game,

780
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
that you may risk running into an adults-only rating,

781
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
kind of like Manhunt 2 did.

782
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But, I think that's stupid that they think that scene is,

783
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
there's been games out there that have had similar things already,

784
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
and been released mature,

785
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and have done pretty well, like Scarface, or The Godfather,

786
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
or, I don't know, No More Heroes, or Mad World that's coming out.

787
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So, I guess we'll just leave it to graphics.

788
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I was gonna say, isn't this game just, I mean, controversy aside,

789
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
isn't this game just kind of too much graphically for the Wii?

790
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah.

791
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That's it then, right? Why play the controversy card?

792
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Wouldn't people just accept the fact that the Wii can't handle it, period?

793
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I guess, and you know what, what they need to do is have,

794
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
it's gonna take people releasing a big name game,

795
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
like, another Grand Theft Auto that's on the Wii,

796
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
before companies decide, hey, the Wii's viable for that kind of game,

797
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
because right now, even though there has been some mature games on there,

798
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and they're starting to get a little bit more adult content,

799
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
it's still perceived as a kid's system, just like the GameCube was,

800
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and they're really having trouble getting past that stigmata,

801
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and Nintendo isn't helping.

802
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
They're definitely not helping with Wii music and shit like that,

803
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
but it's just, it's really gonna take a big game like Grand Theft Auto coming out on it,

804
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
before people go, hey, we can release our game on there,

805
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and actually make it for the Wii only.

806
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Alright, fair enough. Well, look, one thing that is certainly exclusive to the Wii

807
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
that we haven't seen on other systems yet is waggling and motion,

808
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and motion's about to get even better when Wii Sports Resort comes out,

809
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and the Motion Plus accessory comes out.

810
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Now, the Motion Plus was developed by a company called InvenSense,

811
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
that actually made this accessory.

812
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Well, news came out this week that this Motion Plus technology,

813
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
there is no exclusive deal with Nintendo,

814
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
meaning that if InvenSense wanted to, they could take this technology to other companies.

815
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Are you listening, Sony or Microsoft?

816
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Now, you know, this instantly makes fanboys think about, you know,

817
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and actually, let me read this official quote that came from it.

818
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
This came from company head Joe Virginia.

819
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Now, I can't get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology,

820
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
but as you might imagine, of course, there's more interest out there.

821
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So, you know, rumors have been abounding for a long time

822
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
that Microsoft was gonna get into the whole motion game,

823
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
although they didn't at E3, which was the expected time.

824
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Personally, I don't see the other consoles getting into this whole motion thing and the Motion Plus.

825
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You know where I bet this accessory ends up turning up?

826
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Again, PC.

827
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I bet you we see some type of small scale release of this accessory on a PC.

828
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Here's my thing, is like, if you're Nintendo,

829
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and you're concerned about having, you know, all your proprietary stuff,

830
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
why do you put out this peripheral that's supposed to make things better,

831
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and supposed to make things extremely lifelike, or very sensitive to your movements,

832
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and then you don't make it exclusive to yourself?

833
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That's kind of retarded.

834
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's like, I made this really awesome invention!

835
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That'll make our game system awesome, and no one else can have it!

836
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Oh wait, no they can.

837
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Now, Game Guru in chat has a comment that's kind of along those lines.

838
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
He says, but Nintendo owns the patent on the pointer,

839
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and that's the big plus for the Wii.

840
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Is that, you know, and granted, if this Motion Plus technology were to be adapted by the other companies,

841
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
they wouldn't be able to do it in that same style that the Wii does.

842
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah, I don't know.

843
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Really, I mean, I think this is going to be like Rock Band and Guitar Hero.

844
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Maybe PlayStation will adopt this technology and they'll have 12-axis!

845
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
They'll just, what they'll do is they'll make something that will work exactly the same.

846
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It'll be just different enough so that they can't get sued.

847
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
That's it.

848
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Alright, well we'll see what happens.

849
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Maybe next year's E3. Who knows? Who knows?

850
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So, let's move on.

851
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
DMN and I are having a fight to the death in the chat room.

852
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
What, why? Over what?

853
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Over Rondo of Blood.

854
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
We're going to have a fight at PAX.

855
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Awesome.

856
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But I said that I would win, because girls play dirty.

857
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Which, by the way, all three of us are going to be at PAX in like three weeks from today.

858
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We are going to be flying home, but we will have just spent the weekend at PAX.

859
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
He can't use the Elec Beam Pause trick on me because the Blaster Master Grenade trick is stronger.

860
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Gaming news?

861
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I counter with my Konami code.

862
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
They're going to LARP to the death.

863
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
LARP to the death? Dude, that would be an awesome band name.

864
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Hey Rob.

865
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What? Let's make a band in Rock Band and call it LARP to the death.

866
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Alright, sorry, gaming news.

867
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Dragon Quest IV. It gets a date in Europe.

868
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Which, okay, I'm wondering where the number thing is, because we've got, what, six over here.

869
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But they've already had six in Japan, and they're up to, what, eight now?

870
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And whatever the hell.

871
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Nine on DS soon.

872
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I know! And this is the DS one they're talking about.

873
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Dragon Quest, the Chapters of the Chosen, which is in the trilogy of The Hand of the Heavenly Bride and the Realms of Reverie coming next.

874
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So it's supposed to be released in, okay, here's what it is.

875
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Dragon Quest IV was released on the NES in February 1990, and it was Dragon Warrior IV over here.

876
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So this is a DS remake is what they're getting.

877
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And they said that they're supposed to get it on September 12th over in Europe.

878
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So, hey, cool.

879
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And you get that, you know, fantastic Toriyama artwork.

880
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So, go for it.

881
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Cool.

882
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The end. Oh, not just the end. There's more.

883
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But wait.

884
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Even more. More money, more prizes. I love it. Anyway.

885
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Someone gets a dollar if they guess what game that's from.

886
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Smash TV. Where's my dollar?

887
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I've gave you a dollar before.

888
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You get a retro dollar, so I've already given it to you.

889
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What can I buy with a retro dollar?

890
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
iTunes Long.

891
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Woo!

892
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You can buy flashing graphics in-

893
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Oh, yeah, I can buy flashing retro graphics.

894
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Remember things the way they used to be.

895
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Chrono Trigger!

896
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Ooh, yes.

897
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
See, that gets Rob's attention.

898
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There has been a kind of date given for Chrono Trigger in Europe.

899
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
This is for the DS version.

900
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
They're supposed to get it early 2009, so it's going to be after the US holiday launch.

901
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So we're getting it, of course, for the Christmas slash Kwanzaa slash whatever.

902
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
For Kwanzaa.

903
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Yeah.

904
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Europe never got Chrono Trigger the first time.

905
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So this is big for them.

906
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I think the PlayStation 1 came out.

907
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Really?

908
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I think so.

909
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I thought the Super Nintendo 1 never did, though.

910
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I think you're right.

911
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I could be wrong.

912
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I thought the Europe date disappeared.

913
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Oh, that was for... No, I think that's something else.

914
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What was it? What else was I going to say? Was there more? I'm sorry.

915
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes.

916
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Oh, go ahead.

917
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Rob. Heart.

918
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
What?

919
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Anyway.

920
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But really, the DS version, the things it's going to have is a touchscreen control.

921
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You can use both the dual screens, a new dungeon, wireless play of some unnamed variety.

922
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And it's actually pretty cool.

923
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And there's also, just if anyone is curious, there is a gallery up on Eurogamer that has screenshots.

924
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So I'll link that in the chat room if anyone wants to check it out.

925
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
All right, chat.orangesongerator.com if you want to join our chat room.

926
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I thought I knew what it was I wanted to ask you about.

927
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Because we were talking about old video games and collecting and all that stuff.

928
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
42.

929
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Okay, sure.

930
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Here's the thing.

931
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I went to a local record store the other day that was having a big video game sale, used video game sale.

932
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I found Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link, in a gold cartridge for $5.

933
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Is that a good deal?

934
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah, I'd say so.

935
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I should have picked that up.

936
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Because I was looking at it going, wasn't that the first Zelda they remade in the gray carts?

937
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So the gold carts are really valuable?

938
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Or am I crazy?

939
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Valuable, but they're neat.

940
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Especially if you've got the box.

941
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It would be worth $5 just to have the old school cart.

942
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
We can put it up on the wall in the big blank spot we have on Justin TV.

943
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm pointing at the blank spot.

944
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The thing to watch out for those is the battery.

945
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Well, I wouldn't play the game.

946
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't have an old school Nintendo to play it on.

947
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Well, I told you I was going to lend you one if I can find one.

948
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Can't you replace the battery?

949
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You can replace the battery, if I'm right.

950
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I think it just uses a standard small lithium battery.

951
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We replace the batteries in our Saturn all the time.

952
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And I mean all the damn time.

953
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Alright, fair enough.

954
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Well, alright, let's move on.

955
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Sorry to derail the current gaming news, but I just had to know, good deals or not?

956
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We're doing a public service.

957
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Good deal, bad deal.

958
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Good deal, bad deal.

959
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Your batteries can be saved.

960
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The store was advertising a huge video game blowout, like it was like five games for $13.

961
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Okay.

962
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The one that used to be a tower.

963
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
They were advertising a big sale on used games, like five games for $13.

964
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I was like, well, I need to go in and see what it is.

965
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Okay, guess what all the games were that were $5 for $13?

966
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Sports games.

967
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
All outdated sports games, like NHL, 06.

968
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
All the games where all the servers got shut down.

969
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
They can't get rid of them.

970
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I went in looking for, what I was looking for in there?

971
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Old NES games.

972
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
They had some in there.

973
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Well, yeah.

974
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That's where I saw Zelda.

975
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Well, originally, before I bought you Blastworks, my intention was to go there and find an original copy of The Guardian Legend,

976
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
which obviously wouldn't be there because it's too valuable, but, you know.

977
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The one time I found a cartridge of The Guardian Legend was at that random store that Rama and company took me to in New York City,

978
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
the one time I went to visit.

979
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But I will tell you what I did find that was freaking awesome that I found at the sale,

980
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
because not only were they selling video games, but they were selling music,

981
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and I found for $2 Paula Abdul Spellbound.

982
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Oh, God.

983
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That was the one with Rush Rush on it, wasn't it?

984
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yes, it was.

985
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I like that song.

986
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It also had such awesome songs as The Promise of a New Day,

987
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
which I was trying to play a clip of here on air, but my computer's freezing up on me, which probably...

988
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
No, it has a taste screen.

989
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, there we go.

990
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It has a taste screen.

991
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
$2 for this.

992
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Diet Coke, yo.

993
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Alright, please.

994
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Promise of a New Game, Loki?

995
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Please stop that.

996
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
There is a pretty cool hack that got released this week on the Wii,

997
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and it will allow you to actually play region-free Wii games with no mod chips whatsoever.

998
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What this will require, though, is that you have the homebrew channel installed,

999
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and when you install this, it will do some other things as well.

1000
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
You can play region-free GameCube games, region-free Wii games.

1001
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
You can have region-free channels.

1002
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You can also remove the main menu background music.

1003
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You can go to the Wii's rescue menu that they use for diagnostics.

1004
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I guess the diagnostic discs.

1005
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And you can also remove the health warning screen that pops up in the beginning when you turn the Wii on.

1006
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Well, thank God, because that thing annoys me more than anything.

1007
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I believe you have to have Wii system version 3.2, I want to say.

1008
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Unfortunately, if you have it all the way updated now, you can't use this.

1009
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm sorry, I can't stop laughing at the fact that somebody actually sat there and said,

1010
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
you know what I'm going to do to my Wii?

1011
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You know what project I'm going to take on?

1012
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm going to get rid of that health warning screen, because dammit, that thing's annoying.

1013
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Meanwhile, people are starving in other countries, and war breaks out.

1014
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
But you got rid of the health warning.

1015
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yes, it is. The process to patch it is safe, so you won't brick your console.

1016
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The only thing that will happen is if you update your console again, it will erase all these updates that you've just made to it.

1017
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So, that's the only problem.

1018
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:11,000
But they are working on ways to prevent that, and like I said, I think it's only compatible right now with version 3.2 firmware.

1019
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Act deaf to saying in chat that patch is only for Europe, Loki, with patch in quotes.

1020
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Does anyone really need to remove the health warning screen that bad?

1021
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I mean, really? Really? Is it that intrusive? Maybe you should be reading it.

1022
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Anything else in the Wii hacking world going on that we should be aware of?

1023
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
No, that would be it.

1024
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Well, anyhow, maybe if we hacked some of the more recent Sonic games, we could actually make them good.

1025
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But some of the more recent Sonic... I'm not talking about classic Sonic. That was always good.

1026
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm talking about the more recent Sonic games, and this is kind of amazing.

1027
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And yes, it's newsworthy.

1028
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
There was an interview this week that Sega's Vice President of Marketing, Sean Ratcliffe, did with Game Daily.

1029
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And what apparently Game Daily, in this interview, he says that he kind of admits in a way that Sonic has not been quite as good as it could have been.

1030
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I mean, he didn't come out and say, Sonic sucks.

1031
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But there was this interesting quote.

1032
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Some of that criticism is probably warranted.

1033
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,000
We definitely recognize that a franchise that has been going as long as Sonic, you have to put a huge amount of effort in to make sure that you maintain that quality.

1034
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Which is why you're seeing us this year take the first steps in making sure the quality is right.

1035
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And we're constantly looking at innovation, blending classic 2D gameplay with 3D, beautiful, landscape-rich environments.

1036
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So, and then continues on.

1037
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
For fans of Sonic that has been looking for the next-gen experience, this is the game they've been waiting for.

1038
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So, I guess all those other games were just like... I like the way he does that with words.

1039
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Kind of sweeps the other games under the table.

1040
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Oh, no, no, this. This is the game you've been waiting for right here.

1041
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
This is the good stuff.

1042
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Awesome.

1043
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Mean it. That's all I say. And mean it. Because you only got so many chances left before people just, you know, aren't buying this anymore.

1044
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But then again, I don't know. You could make 20 crappy Sonic games and if one comes out and it's really good, word will get around. People will buy it.

1045
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It's just about time they say, yeah, we fucked up.

1046
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I was going to ask you, as a Sonic fangirl, and general Sega fangirl in general, look at your classic games of the week.

1047
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:29,000
The last Sonic game that they did right was the first Sonic Adventure, I thought. And that, and I did like, what was the racing game that they had on PSP? Sonic Rush, wasn't it?

1048
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I think so.

1049
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,000
That one was pretty fun, too. But any of the other 3D offerings that they've given, I really didn't find all that exciting.

1050
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And that one that we played at E3 a couple years ago, the control was absolute shit. So, what the hell, right?

1051
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Right.

1052
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Startetsuya says, I concur.

1053
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:55,000
They made me cry. They made my soul hurt. They made my soul hurt almost as much as seeing stuff from my childhood used to sell cars.

1054
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And here's the comment you always see anytime Sega gets brought up by SSJ100. Matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com. Dear Sega, Shenmue 3.

1055
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I wish they would. Now, I liked the Shenmue series. So, whatever.

1056
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Shenmue's one of those things that was hokey when it came out, but it aged like a fine wine.

1057
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It was great. And C-Man.

1058
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Let's play Lucky Hit.

1059
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Well, how about something else?

1060
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
How about something else?

1061
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
EA. I know people like to groan and everything, but here's something new to groan about.

1062
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:36,000
EA is going to be doing a series of games for PC and DS that is going to be off of the Four Dummies series of books.

1063
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You can actually, for now, download Poker for Dummies on PC off the Pogo download area.

1064
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Well, in theory, you're supposed to be able to. That means if it's up there.

1065
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But there's also going to be Texas Hold'em, Omaha Seven Car Stud.

1066
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And then there's going to be Solitaire for Dummies, Brain Training for Dummies.

1067
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That's in October. The Solitaire one's in September. Sudoku for Dummies in November.

1068
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And a whole bunch more.

1069
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
How about Braid for Dummies? That's what I need.

1070
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Well, you know what?

1071
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm serious.

1072
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
How about... I want games for smart people.

1073
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I want, like, Mensa Solitaire.

1074
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Then you need to go play those, like, cruel games.

1075
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Like, I Want to Be the Guy or La Mulana or those types of games that are cruel and unusual.

1076
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
No, I mean, like, poker and puzzle and stuff games.

1077
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I want games... I want Mensa Solitaire.

1078
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Fair enough, but here's the problem I have with this whole thing.

1079
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Although it's cute that they have the licensing for dummies,

1080
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
look at the games they're putting out. Sudoku, Solitaire, Texas Hold'em.

1081
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I mean, we've got, like, 50,000 versions of those games across all the consoles already.

1082
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
What's going to make these so special besides the Four Dummies tagline and the little cartoon guy pointing?

1083
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
The fact that people are admitting to it. That's pretty funny.

1084
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I guess.

1085
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
But, you know, that makes me think that the Strong Bad game might actually be sort of a parody in the title of that, too.

1086
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Instead of, you know, For Dummies, you have For Attractive People.

1087
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Game Guru suggests Sonic For Dummies. Frisbee says Dummies For Dummies.

1088
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
That would be the last few ones.

1089
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I even... they have For Dummies everything now, so...

1090
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah, I know.

1091
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
They have Childbirth For Dummies.

1092
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
They have Podcasting For Dummies, a book I was reading last week.

1093
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Guess what? We didn't need that book.

1094
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Well, we're living examples of the fact that any dummy can podcast. For real.

1095
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I thought it took a special kind of dummy.

1096
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It does.

1097
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It takes a special sort of self-depreciating dummy to do it every week.

1098
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
No, it takes a special kind of dummy, or dare I say it, idiot, to do it for over six years.

1099
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And who's coming up on 300?

1100
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Practically every Sunday straight. I mean, granted, we miss some here and there, but, you know...

1101
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I don't know. I thought we were a little crooked.

1102
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
We're all a little bent here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1103
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Hey, how about release dates for dummies?

1104
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yes. Well, this week... I hope you like Madden, because that's coming out on everything.

1105
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Including, God knows why, the original Xbox.

1106
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Because, you know, that's a viable platform these days.

1107
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Anyways, so other things coming out other than Madden.

1108
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I guess this is still kind of Madden-related. You get the Madden PSP bundle coming out this week.

1109
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,000
There is also some crappy PC games, Sinking Island, and Dracula III Path of the Dragon.

1110
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
What exactly happens in Sinking Island?

1111
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Well...

1112
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
The island sinks!

1113
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Oh my God, spoiler alert!

1114
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And then the ship crashes into an iceberg.

1115
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm glad Jack dies. Oh my God.

1116
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm glad you asked.

1117
00:48:45,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Sinking Island is about Walter Jones, a billionaire who was found dead at the bottom of a huge art deco tower that he had built as a magnificent getaway on a tropical island.

1118
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:19,000
There are ten suspects who all have a motive for Mr. Jones' untimely death, as Inspector Jack Norm, you have three days before the island disappears and sinks into the ocean to find the truth behind this mysterious death and catch the killer.

1119
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I want this game.

1120
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It sounds like Clue mixed with the island of Dr. Moreau.

1121
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Mixed with Bioshock, because it's a tower in the middle of the ocean.

1122
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You know what? Sometimes these little shitty sounding games are real gems, so you know what? I hope you're wrong. I hope this game is amazing.

1123
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And I hope the island does sink and you're on it.

1124
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
If that's not amazing enough for you, then maybe the Cheetah Girls Passport to Stardom on the DS would be your type of game.

1125
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Best week ever!

1126
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Awesome. Well, here's actually a game that might not be so bad. Space Siege is coming out on the PC.

1127
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Wait, Space Age?

1128
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Space Siege, like Dungeon Siege.

1129
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I was thinking Space Ace in my book for some reason.

1130
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Hopefully there will not be a movie being made for this.

1131
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Also this week, Imagine Teacher.

1132
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
For you to teach your Imagine Babies. I don't know.

1133
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yes, Imagine Teacher.

1134
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Imagine Teacher. I am a teacher, kind of. I teach adults. That's my day job.

1135
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
This game you actually have to create lesson plans and stuff like that.

1136
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Wow. I'm kind of curious about this game.

1137
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Silent Hunter 4, the Gold Edition, is coming out on PC as well.

1138
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Ford Racing Off-Road, also for the PC.

1139
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And... Oh, did I forget to mention?

1140
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Madden the 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition.

1141
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So that's a whole bunch of Madden and a whole bunch of stuff.

1142
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it on the list, but I think Line Rider 2 is supposed to be coming out this week.

1143
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Although, judging that I don't see it on this list anymore, it might have been delayed.

1144
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And if you want to check out Madden, but you don't feel like shelling out that kind of money,

1145
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
you could probably find Madden 05 or Madden 04 for about 2 bucks this week at certain closeout sales.

1146
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah, we've got like 900 copies of Madden 05.

1147
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Nice.

1148
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
We'll sell them cheap.

1149
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Can you melt them down in a landfill or something like that?

1150
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I've told them to throw them away.

1151
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Well, let's travel over to Japan and Asia in general. Sometimes we cover the Asian release dates as well.

1152
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Madden NFL 09 will come out in Asia as well the same day it comes out here in the US.

1153
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Meanwhile, Tales of Vesperia, the Japanese version, also makes its way to other Asian regions this week.

1154
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Otherwise, in Japan itself, nothing on the Xbox 360 this week.

1155
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
How about on the PlayStation 3?

1156
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Same story. There's really nothing new.

1157
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You're going to have to wait until the 21st when Vampire Rain comes out for something new.

1158
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Moving on to the Wii.

1159
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Nothing there either.

1160
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's a very slow week in Japan.

1161
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I guess just not a lot of demand.

1162
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Do you think they're all importing Madden or what the hell's going on?

1163
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I don't know.

1164
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Olympics?

1165
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Well, I guess I could be.

1166
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,000
On the PlayStation 2, Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka Para Iro is coming out in regular and limited edition.

1167
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That is one new release you're getting this week.

1168
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It's an adventure game that stars cute anime girls and cute anime cutscenes.

1169
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Your favorite. It looks like one of the girls is a radio DJ.

1170
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Perhaps she's a podcaster.

1171
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Perhaps.

1172
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:35,000
This could be Dark Sakura if she had blonde hair and a disproportionate size boobies and one eye strangely larger than the other.

1173
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Sometimes I wish you sat on cam because that was really funny.

1174
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Hell no.

1175
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That was really funny.

1176
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I've had blonde hair before.

1177
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Really?

1178
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
It sucks.

1179
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Really? I'd like to see that.

1180
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
You've seen me with blonde bangs.

1181
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I have seen you with blonde bangs.

1182
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I did not look good at all.

1183
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Wow. Alright. Fair enough.

1184
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Coming out on the Nintendo DS, a game called...

1185
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I'm sorry. It's not a game. It's an accessory.

1186
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Accessories for your DS to make it look like Stitch from Leo and Stitch or Jack Skellington.

1187
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
That looks kind of cool.

1188
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Or Pooh from Winnie the Pooh.

1189
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
You can check those out.

1190
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Otherwise, on the DS, there's no games coming out this week.

1191
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You can make it look like Pooh.

1192
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
That's a really slow week.

1193
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
On the PSP, Crazy Taxi Double Punch, which I thought we talked about last week.

1194
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It must have gotten delayed.

1195
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Also, Memories of Sorikata is coming out on the PSP from Cyberfront.

1196
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And it looks to be another game starring Anime Girls.

1197
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Ah, yes. I found Line Rider 2.

1198
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Delayed to September. Not surprised.

1199
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Nope.

1200
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So, a slow week in Japan as well. Sorry to say.

1201
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
How about the UK, Dark Soccer? Same story over there or what?

1202
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
There's a few things. Not really many, I guess.

1203
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
We have Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, Episode 1.

1204
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Homestar Ruiner on PC and Wii.

1205
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Fabled 2 Pub Games on Xbox 360.

1206
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Ferrari Challenge on Wii.

1207
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Madden NFL 2009 on Xbox 360 and Wii.

1208
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Puzzler Collection on Wii.

1209
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And Table Football on Wii.

1210
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Well, that's a Wii-tastic week.

1211
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Madden.

1212
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
All I've been hearing about that is Madden since my husband has to work the launch.

1213
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Plus, and Loki made a good point earlier.

1214
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
This isn't a good week to release games with the Olympics going on.

1215
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And that is something that affects the world, in a way.

1216
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Because there are lots and lots of people watching the Olympics.

1217
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I don't even really watch sports, usually, on TV.

1218
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
But I'll watch diving.

1219
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You know my calendar? I have the Freakonomics calendar.

1220
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It actually stated why they wanted it specifically to be August 8, 2008.

1221
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
To have the Olympics open is because 8 is a lucky number in China.

1222
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Exactly. Apparently there was a huge amount of couples that got married on 8-8-0-8.

1223
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Because of the significance of the lucky number.

1224
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But I just wanted to say, isn't it interesting how there's two sports that everybody seems to tune into?

1225
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Depending on what your preferences are. There's men's diving, and there's women's volleyball.

1226
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
You know what I actually always enjoy watching?

1227
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I actually like the gymnastics.

1228
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Gymnastics is fun to watch.

1229
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
For both.

1230
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Just for whatever.

1231
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And that and women's swimming.

1232
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Women's volleyball still got the same outfits they had four years ago?

1233
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I don't know. Those women are kind of like, you know, female gym teachers anyways.

1234
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And no thanks.

1235
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Not really.

1236
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Also, though, I actually have to crack up.

1237
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Because I want to see if anyone makes the same mistake that the target shoot guy did last year.

1238
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And to hit the target beyond his target?

1239
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
That's pretty awesome. However, he did not hit his target.

1240
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Is Geena Davis going to be doing archery this year? That's what I want to know.

1241
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Because, you know, Thelma is an archer.

1242
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Forget it.

1243
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I was going to say, my favorite events are the ninjutsu events.

1244
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The what?

1245
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The ninjutsu events.

1246
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
They have ninja events?

1247
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I like fencing.

1248
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
You never see them?

1249
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
No. Shut up.

1250
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
He likes curling.

1251
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Gaming, nudes.

1252
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Dude, curling is awesome. That's the best part of deca sports.

1253
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Alright, that's the best part of the summer event.

1254
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Shut up.

1255
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Gaming, nudes.

1256
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Fable 2.

1257
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
They've made the announcement that's coming out October 21st in the US.

1258
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
October 24th in Europe.

1259
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And, of course, along with that, they are going to be getting the Fable 2 collector's edition.

1260
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Which includes some, I guess they're like tarot cards.

1261
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
A bonus DVD with some behind the scenes stuff.

1262
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Also a little figurine.

1263
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And if you pre-order your games now, as Jamie mentioned, the Xbox Live Arcade pub games will be available starting August 13th.

1264
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:56,000
One other cool thing, though, that you get with the limited edition is Master Chief.

1265
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Created in Fable 2.

1266
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
As opposed to Master Chef.

1267
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Using the character creator.

1268
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Interesting.

1269
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I suppose.

1270
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
That's pretty cool.

1271
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Although, he looked a little weird. I mean, it's kind of like taking a character that looks kind of like him and calling him Master Chief.

1272
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It's weird.

1273
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Well, they had something like this that they did during a demonstration at U3 where they created a character like this and I guess they kind of tweaked it a little bit more.

1274
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I don't know. It's neat. He has a lot of belts.

1275
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
A lot of belts.

1276
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I don't know.

1277
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I mean, I'm getting the limited edition because I like crap like that.

1278
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I don't know.

1279
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Alright, I apologize in advance if I'm horribly mispronouncing the name of this thing.

1280
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It's Oni Chambara? Is that what that is?

1281
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
That's correct.

1282
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Alright, my Japanese is getting better.

1283
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Just disregard that. You might want to know this game as Bikini Samurai Squad.

1284
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's still Oni Chambara. That's just a subtitle.

1285
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Whatever, but look.

1286
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It's chicks.

1287
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Speaking of women's volleyball outfits.

1288
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It's chicks in bikinis wielding swords.

1289
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I mean, hello. Do you need anything more in a video game?

1290
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The only thing this game is missing is zombies.

1291
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh, wait. I think they have those too.

1292
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
They're battling a zombie horde.

1293
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I mean, do games get any better? I think not.

1294
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
It's a chick wearing lingerie with a cowboy hat.

1295
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
You forgot the cowboy hat.

1296
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Oh, my bad.

1297
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And she has a samurai sword killing zombies.

1298
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I already told you this is the greatest game on the face of the earth except for maybe Earth Defense Force which, please God, make another Earth Defense Force game.

1299
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Seriously?

1300
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,000
This game is the second game I've been waiting to come over here from the Simple series and thank God it's finally here.

1301
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It is coming out over here. D3 publisher is going to port the game to the US in hopes that people everywhere will bow down to women with swords in bikinis slashing zombies.

1302
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Dark Sakura sound like your kind of game?

1303
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
That sounds like fun.

1304
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I know, it does sound like fun.

1305
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
If you don't want it on 360, remember they do have the Wii version coming out as well.

1306
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Alright.

1307
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Wii!

1308
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,000
You know, I almost, I almost brought my Wii today to bring that, to view that game.

1309
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Next week though.

1310
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Next week.

1311
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Or whenever.

1312
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I must see this game.

1313
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You know, we should just have a special playing that are pre-recording.

1314
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Ooh, that might work.

1315
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Get that game imported or whatever you gotta do. Let's check it out.

1316
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Alright.

1317
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Already have it, yeah.

1318
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Sweet.

1319
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Well, other news, so you know we've been sitting around speculating about why Final Fantasy 13 is going to be coming out on Xbox 360?

1320
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Well, Microsoft has said something.

1321
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Actually one of their marketers, Albert Panello, said that it was actually the Xbox 360 sales, like I had speculated before, were what would bring Final Fantasy 13 to the system.

1322
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
They said that they didn't really make any sort of behind doors deal.

1323
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:02,000
They didn't offer a lot of money for them to, for Squeenix to break their exclusivity contract.

1324
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I can't speak today.

1325
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
That's alright.

1326
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I've had a crap week.

1327
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
They offered the market share.

1328
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
That's what they offered them.

1329
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Exactly.

1330
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Xbox 360 does have the superior market in the United States.

1331
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So far they've had more term on it, more sales overall.

1332
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:29,000
And they're actually stating right now that that was the specific reason that Square said, you know what, let's just do it.

1333
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Let's put it out on the 360 in the US.

1334
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And they also are committed to a simultaneous launch for both of them.

1335
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
But their speculation is that that's going to hold up our PS3 release date in the US.

1336
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But, depending on how long they've had this going, you know, had this idea forming, they may have already started work on the port.

1337
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I could hope so.

1338
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
They swear they haven't and they're not going to, but you never know.

1339
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I saw the note on there that says they haven't begun work on the 360 version yet.

1340
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
But it could be a lie.

1341
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You know what I mean?

1342
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
It could be a lie.

1343
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
They don't have to tell us the truth.

1344
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It's very true.

1345
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
But it likely is the truth.

1346
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I mean, why would they lie?

1347
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I mean, it could be that they've started, you know, work on one that could just be easily converted to either platform.

1348
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Well, my whole thought is they had to explore the fact that it was doable, right?

1349
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Well, I don't think that they, what they do when they start programming these games is just, you're not going to have, oh, we are going to do everything on this dev kit.

1350
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
No, you're going to start your textures in whatever your 3D program is.

1351
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You're going to start working, you know, laying out your scripts and, you know, other programs.

1352
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's not, it's got to come together on a PC or Mac or something, or maybe they do it in Linux.

1353
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I don't know.

1354
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:54,000
But anyway, whatever way they have to come through it on some sort of computer to get everything together.

1355
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And then it's made compatible with the hardware given.

1356
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So I think it's not going to be that difficult, especially since we've seen plenty of ports from one system to the other that didn't lose all that much, so.

1357
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
All right, let's get some comments from chat.

1358
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
JV Mon says, I don't mind Final Fantasy 13 being delayed if it means I get it on the 360.

1359
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Keltipo says, Final Fantasy 13 seems so far off at this point, another delay doesn't seem so bad.

1360
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
That's kind of how I feel.

1361
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I mean, it's like, it's that little spark way off in the distance that, you know, I'm kind of not expecting to see this game before Christmas next year anyway.

1362
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So there you have it.

1363
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Chat.orangelaundry.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night as we tape on allgames.com.

1364
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
As we always do, 6 o'clock Pacific time on Sunday nights, except for next week.

1365
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Besides, you have to remember the development cycle starts off with their department for making kickass CG trailers for said game before they even work on the game.

1366
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
So, possibly, you might be onto something.

1367
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Especially when the final looks nothing like the trailer.

1368
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Let's move on.

1369
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
We've got the classic game of the week coming up in just a couple more stories in our break.

1370
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And then part B. Loki.

1371
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Besides, I have one question for you.

1372
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
What is better than Final Fantasy 13?

1373
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Well, I'll answer that with another question.

1374
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

1375
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Damn straight, that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1376
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Game of the year right there.

1377
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Will it have Jeff Foxworthy?

1378
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Yes, it will have CG Jeff Foxworthy.

1379
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
He looks like a zombie, by the way. I don't know.

1380
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Can a fifth grader beat Braid? If so, I'm in trouble.

1381
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I don't know, maybe.

1382
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Is this going to be one of their massively online games that we're teasing at E3, like 1 versus 100?

1383
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
No, I'm going to guess this is going to be their crappy port of the Wii game that's coming out.

1384
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But it is being put out by THQ, which I do think they are putting out the crappy game.

1385
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And yeah, it should be coming out sometime after all the cool games come out on Xbox Live Arcade this month.

1386
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Oh well.

1387
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Hey, wait, is Xbox Live Arcade?

1388
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Xbox Live Arcade.

1389
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Well, that's kind of interesting, I guess.

1390
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
So I can embarrass myself and my friends online with what I don't know.

1391
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yeah.

1392
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Although usually I seem to watch the show and I seem to do okay on the show.

1393
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But sometimes there's like a world history question that I just don't get.

1394
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Because history was never my strong subject.

1395
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I don't know, he's just creepy looking, man.

1396
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Seriously, it's like, if you get this question wrong, I'm going to jump through the TV and eat your brain.

1397
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Look how small his head is!

1398
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
His head's shaped like a cantaloupe.

1399
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm going to show the chat room what his head looks like, okay?

1400
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Look at his head!

1401
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:39,000
DarkTetsuya says, bye, give me the mole on Xbox Live Arcade. Reality games on Xbox Live Arcade, I don't think that could happen, though.

1402
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
They're too psychological intensive.

1403
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Anyway, speaking of Xbox Live Arcade games, we've been talking a lot, a lot, a lot about Braid tonight.

1404
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
A lot of people have been talking about Braid.

1405
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
What's very interesting, though, have you checked out the official walkthrough for Braid?

1406
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
The creator, Jonathan Blow, actually put up an official walkthrough for Braid.

1407
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
It's available at braid-game.com slash walkthrough.

1408
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I'm going to go ahead and give you a spoiler for the walkthrough.

1409
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:11,000
The first page tells you how to power up the game, how to get into the actual game itself from the sunset-looking starting screen.

1410
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And then you go into page two of the game after you get walked through the first world.

1411
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And page two tells you, solve the puzzles yourself and stop using a walkthrough.

1412
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
You stupid dork!

1413
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
All the puzzles in Braid are reasonable.

1414
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
If you're having problems solving a puzzle, don't give up.

1415
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Please do not use a walkthrough. Don't give up. Thank you for your time.

1416
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And yet, might I point out the irony that currently this game is sitting at number three on the most requested FAQs on GameFAQs.

1417
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Probably from people feeling as dumb as me.

1418
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
However, I will say, though, there are rewards to be got from this game, like any game, from not using a walkthrough.

1419
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
That's not going to stop some people that want to know the story, and there is going to come a point where I'm just not going to be able to freaking resist.

1420
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
But I do like the little trick played on us by the official developers. I thought it was cute, if nothing else.

1421
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And that was something I found, by the way, on Major Nels' Twitter, which you were saying earlier in the show.

1422
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I've been thinking that's major use.

1423
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And there's some pretty funny stuff that he posts every so often.

1424
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
You should also add on the Xbox staff, Trixie's there.

1425
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
She posts a lot more random stuff, but she's a good read, too.

1426
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
There's a lot of great gaming people on Twitter. That's like the place where everybody's at right now.

1427
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I have Twitterrific on my iPhone.

1428
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
There's so many other indie game podcasters I'm following on Twitter.

1429
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Godfree, Gamer Edie, Bobby, just off the top of my head.

1430
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
On top of that, there's other famous individuals on there. Will Wheaton has a Twitter.

1431
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
So I've been reading that.

1432
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Dude, Obama is following me.

1433
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
No, that's how I found his Twitter.

1434
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Nice.

1435
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And I was like, dude, I'm not even anything on there that says anything about being Democrat.

1436
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm a Libertarian.

1437
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Although I'm voting for him.

1438
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Alright. Danger, danger, political discussion, danger.

1439
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I can say who I'm voting for.

1440
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Alright.

1441
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Let's get into other topics, though.

1442
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Like your vote for the Classic Game of the Week that all the kids should be playing this week.

1443
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Because every week you like to pick a game from the archives.

1444
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And this week, as I understand it, we have a nice change of pace.

1445
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It's not Sega-related this week.

1446
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Sort of.

1447
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I'm just messing with you.

1448
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Alright, here it is, folks, your Classic Game of the Week.

1449
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
What should the kiddies be dusting off and playing this week?

1450
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I think this also wins the About Damn Time award, too.

1451
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Because the game that I picked is Tempest 2000.

1452
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Nice.

1453
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Tempest 2000 is one of the only good games on the Atari Jaguar.

1454
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
It is the only Atari Jaguar game that I have ever used in this segment.

1455
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And I'm actually referring to the Sega Saturn version, which is the one that I have.

1456
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
So, screw a bunch of the Atari Jaguar.

1457
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I have played this on the Jaguar, believe it or not, and I endorse it on the Jaguar.

1458
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
It's a good time.

1459
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
You just have to play the music.

1460
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Let's take a listen to some of the hot techno music in the game.

1461
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Remember this?

1462
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh, hell yeah.

1463
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Super Zapper Recharge.

1464
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Remember the soundtrack I burned off of this resolution to?

1465
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Nice.

1466
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Good times.

1467
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Anyway, tell us a little more about Tempest 2000.

1468
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Well, if anyone's ever played the original Tempest, it was a vector game that was put

1469
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:26,000
out by Atari where you go on a series of different shaped fields.

1470
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
And you can only move left or right for yourself, but you'll have ones that look like a V or

1471
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
some that look like a giant octagon.

1472
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Or the first stage is basically a straight plane.

1473
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But this one, other than just shooting the little ships as they approach your ship on

1474
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
this plane, you have other little goodies added.

1475
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
You also have spikes that come up.

1476
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I think the spikes were in the original, too, that you have to shoot the spikes all the

1477
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
way back down to the bottom.

1478
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
They will try to, you know, if the enemy ship gets up to the top of the plane, they can

1479
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
catch you.

1480
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Now, what they've added to this one is you get a particle laser so that you can shoot

1481
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
faster and, you know, more energy.

1482
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,000
You can gain points for, you know, bonus ships and stuff.

1483
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
You can get a jump power-up so you can jump over the enemies when they're on the top line.

1484
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,000
An AI droid, which is just this little vector cube that follows you around and shoots.

1485
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
A warp token so you can...

1486
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Wait, wait, wait, we have to listen to this part.

1487
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Oh, this version doesn't have the voice, did it?

1488
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
No, it says it really quietly.

1489
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Super Zapper Recharge is added on the...

1490
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Super Zapper Recharge is the best part.

1491
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Well, you know why this has better music and better musical quality than the Jaguar did?

1492
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Because the Saturn has a much, much better sound processor than the Jaguar did.

1493
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
In fact, I want to even say that the Saturn sound processor was better than what was on

1494
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
the PlayStation.

1495
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Do we get to see the bonus stage in this clip?

1496
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Because that part of the game always tripped me out.

1497
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I didn't watch that movie.

1498
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Oh, that's alright.

1499
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It had the weird ambient music too.

1500
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Let me turn it down a little bit because those gunshots are getting a little annoying.

1501
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Alright, go ahead.

1502
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Sorry.

1503
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:20,000
But you also, as you go through, you can get warp tokens to travel to different stages.

1504
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:27,000
You can also get a power-up to destroy all of the enemies that are on the screen and

1505
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
move you to the next level.

1506
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
It's called Outta Here.

1507
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
You get one that...

1508
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Well, the female voice in there goes, yes, yes, yes, when you get this power-up.

1509
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And you get it when you're warping off a completed one.

1510
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
So it gives that...

1511
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:52,000
So when you start your next level, the first power-up that you get is an AI droid.

1512
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And it says yes, yes, yes, but in that, you know, really high-pitched sort of oh baby

1513
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
way.

1514
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Eat electric death.

1515
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I love that.

1516
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
When you use your giant zapper thing, it says eat electric death.

1517
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
It just happened in the clip here, eat electric death.

1518
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I know, that's so cool.

1519
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Caught you.

1520
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Guy died.

1521
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
And when it says catch, it goes whoa.

1522
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
So we've also got other versions, like this particular music that we're playing here is

1523
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
like I said, the Sega Saturn version.

1524
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
It did first come out on Atari Jaguar.

1525
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
There was a PlayStation version that's called Tempest X3.

1526
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
It's supposed to be updated graphics and music, but it's...

1527
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Actually, I don't think it's as much fun.

1528
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:50,000
However, if you put in all caps Y-I-F-F exclamation point on the high score table, you get to play

1529
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
the original Tempest 2000.

1530
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Nice.

1531
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
But it doesn't save any of your high scores, so that's kind of sad.

1532
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
They also have this on PC, right?

1533
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Because I remember playing this on PC.

1534
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yes, there's a PC version, which I've got it somewhere.

1535
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
There's also...

1536
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
You can actually get a soundtrack for it.

1537
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I mean, although, honestly, with the Saturn version, all you have to do, it's all Redbook

1538
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
audio.

1539
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
There's been other games that try to be like Tempest since Tempest 2000.

1540
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I don't know.

1541
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I apologize.

1542
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
You were going to talk about this, but...

1543
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
There was Space Giraffe.

1544
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Yes, Space Giraffe on Xbox Live, but the problem with Space Giraffe is that it was kind of

1545
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
funny, like it had its moments that it was really funny, but the problem I had with it

1546
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
is that graphically, the game was ruined.

1547
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I mean, how graphics can single-handedly ruin a game.

1548
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,000
And the same problem I had with Tempest on Xbox Live Arcade, they remade the original

1549
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Tempest, did this whole remake of the original Tempest, it was missing that...

1550
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
There's a Tempest 3000.

1551
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
There's that X factor I can't put my finger on that Tempest 2000 had that the Tempest

1552
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
on Xbox Live Arcade most definitely doesn't have.

1553
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I do have to tell you one thing, though, that I do really like about the PlayStation version,

1554
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Tempest 6.3, is it used the NegCon.

1555
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,000
The NegCon for the uninitiated is a Namco controller that you...

1556
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It's separate in the center, so it twists.

1557
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
It was made for Wipeout and other racing games.

1558
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1559
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
All right.

1560
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I have four of them, so...

1561
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Nice.

1562
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It took me forever to find them, but I have two Japanese ones and two American ones.

1563
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,000
But the other thing that I think is interesting is that anyone likes the music in this one,

1564
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
it was actually done by Imagine Design, which is now Brilliant Development, and they did

1565
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
the music for Jaguar Games, Alien vs. Predator, and Battlemorph.

1566
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And I do recall Alien vs. Predator actually having some pretty sweet music.

1567
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
You can also use the Jaguar's rotary controller on this, too, so you can get your sort of

1568
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
old-school stuff.

1569
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
So what you do to get that is you pause on controller one and controller two at the same

1570
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:55,000
time on the options menu, and you can choose the rotary controller.

1571
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
However, the rotary controller actually never was released.

1572
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Nice, nice.

1573
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
You know, what do we say about the Jaguar?

1574
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It sucked!

1575
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Well, you know what?

1576
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I take that back.

1577
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Because there were other... there was another couple of good games, but I think they were

1578
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
also remade original.

1579
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Yeah, anything that was on the Jaguar, it was good.

1580
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It was probably remade.

1581
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,000
But at any rate, there have been people who actually went out and made a rotary controller,

1582
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,000
so you can find them online somewhere, and people have modified old 2600 controllers

1583
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
that are doing that, too.

1584
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:39,000
But anyway, it was designed by Jeff Minter, and so I say go check out some of his other

1585
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
contributions, too, even though he did give us Space Giraffe.

1586
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
All right.

1587
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So that's it, then?

1588
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Tempest 2000, Classic Game of the Week?

1589
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I was really just trying to talk a whole lot so you could keep your music playing and

1590
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
you could highlight your music.

1591
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Well, the clip's about up, so there you have it.

1592
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Your Classic Game of the Week, Tempest 2000.

1593
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Favorite thing about the game in a nutshell?

1594
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
It's awesome.

1595
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
There's not a favorite thing.

1596
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
It's the entire package.

1597
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
It's the whole thing is one.

1598
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Fair enough.

1599
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I will accept that answer.

1600
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
All right.

1601
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
That's going to do it for our Classic Game of the Week and for part A here on Orange

1602
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Lounge Radio.

1603
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Stay tuned, guys.

1604
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
We'll be right back after a quick free break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1605
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:25,000
She's calm.

1606
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
There are a couple of other things I just tell you and I remember.

1607
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
He's crazy.

1608
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
If you could not see the similarities and the personalities within the first couple

1609
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
of episodes, you'd need brain surgery.

1610
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I mean, seriously.

1611
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Can two people get together and record a podcast without driving each other crazy?

1612
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Slap.

1613
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Oh, you just have to hit me so hard.

1614
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
It wasn't that hard.

1615
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your host, DJ Ranma S and Kuro Usagi.

1616
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Log on to DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.

1617
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,000
How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?

1618
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
We should have a rape carnival.

1619
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Tell them to rape things because rape is funny.

1620
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Walk around the neighborhood and rape cats in your neighborhood.

1621
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Hold a plastic knife.

1622
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
You have to have a plastic knife.

1623
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And take pictures.

1624
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen, rape isn't funny.

1625
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Unless if it's clown rape.

1626
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Rape of people is not funny.

1627
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Rape of monsters is funny.

1628
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Because monsters are bad.

1629
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And when bad people...

1630
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
What?

1631
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I'm just not going to keep going.

1632
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Let go of the shovel.

1633
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yeah, I'm digging myself a hole.

1634
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

1635
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
The video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.

1636
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.

1637
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,000
To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.

1638
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Well, except that asshole.

1639
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1640
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games

1641
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.

1642
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
He doesn't even fucking make sense.

1643
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Welcome back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1644
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
August the 10th of 2008 is the night we are taping live.

1645
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Myself, Rob Roberts, joining me as always.

1646
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
DarkSakura.

1647
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Hi!

1648
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Back for more gaming news after feeling a little...

1649
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I had some pretzels to snack on during the break there.

1650
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And some vitamin water to refresh me now.

1651
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Even though they say this stuff is really not as good for you as you'd think.

1652
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I'm full of energy.

1653
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
It's better than soda.

1654
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Good!

1655
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Lots of energy.

1656
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Lots of energy to get through gaming news?

1657
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Yes!

1658
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
How about you, Loki?

1659
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Are you energetic?

1660
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
No.

1661
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I guess not.

1662
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Will you mind doing some gaming news for us anyway?

1663
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Yeah.

1664
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Alright, sure.

1665
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
So, it's already been rumored that it's coming out at some point.

1666
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But Guitar Hero Metallica was pretty much confirmed by Metallica themselves

1667
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
during an interview with Lars Orch.

1668
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And basically, the quote is,

1669
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
if somebody's going to follow up Guitar Hero Aerosmith,

1670
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
we're talking and it's exciting.

1671
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And the people at Guitar Hero and Activision are rapidly becoming our best new friends in the world.

1672
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
You can put the rest of it together yourself.

1673
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
So, yeah.

1674
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Guitar Hero Metallica, once again, horing up the franchise next year.

1675
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
But there's going to be a lot of people that are going to buy this game, even more so than Aerosmith.

1676
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yeah, probably.

1677
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Aerosmith's a pretty rockin' band, don't get me wrong.

1678
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
But Metallica's even more so.

1679
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Metallica is godly.

1680
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Even after the backlash of Napster and all that.

1681
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
We kind of forgot about that.

1682
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
It's really to enlighten St. Inger.

1683
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Am I one of the few people on the planet that actually liked Reload and Load, those albums?

1684
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I loved it!

1685
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I thought those albums were pretty good.

1686
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
The best part of those albums was the fact that Mary Ann Faithfull was on a song.

1687
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
It was so rad.

1688
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
But nothing ever tops the awesome that was the S&M concert.

1689
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Oh, was that the orchestra?

1690
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
The one was Cayman.

1691
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And the, um, what was it?

1692
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Berkeley, I think?

1693
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Yeah, it was local from where they're from.

1694
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Yeah, I just thought it was funny that people who bought season passes for theater and opera had to listen to Metallica.

1695
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Comments from our chat room.

1696
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
chat.orangelandradio.com

1697
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
ActDeaf says,

1698
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Lars is a big sellout, according to ActDeaf, so there are still some people that are Metallica hatin'.

1699
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
JV Monn says,

1700
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
My store still has dozens and dozens of Guitar Hero Aerosmiths still in my store.

1701
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
You know, I've noticed the same thing.

1702
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Loki, any idea, I don't know if you know anything from the inside, but any idea on how Aerosmith Guitar Hero's been selling?

1703
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Um, we sold a lot of it, and then...

1704
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
That's about it.

1705
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
No, not a lot of reorders.

1706
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So, okay, isn't that bad, though, when there's not a lot of reorders?

1707
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Because that means the ones that were bought for the shelves aren't leaving.

1708
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Isn't that bad?

1709
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Uh, could be.

1710
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I mean, I'm not trying to distort the facts or whatever, maybe they are selling really good, but...

1711
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Well, just have a look at the NPD numbers at the end of, uh, for July to see how it did.

1712
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Actually, though, it'd probably still be doing pretty well through July.

1713
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Maybe the NPD number is in September for August to see how well it's doing.

1714
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Hmm. Alright, good.

1715
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Because, um, you know, it sold a lot, but, you know, a lot of people were just picking it up for the hell of it, I guess, I don't know.

1716
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Uh, JV Monn continues,

1717
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
JV Monn continues, Guitar Hero Aerosmith sold really well the first week, then people stopped carrying.

1718
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I do intend on picking it up, but, again, I'm holding out for a price drop, and if they're not leaving shelves, maybe that'll happen sooner than people were telling me it was gonna.

1719
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
The other thing, too, you have to look at is a lot of people may have already had the guitar bundles for it already,

1720
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:43,000
so maybe people just bought way too many bundles for their stores, and the game only versions are selling well.

1721
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Because, I mean, I could see that, especially if, you know, say you're in the Guitar Hero and you've had one through three already,

1722
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
you probably already own a second guitar, you probably don't need a third guitar, so, maybe.

1723
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,000
And Dark Tetsuya says the mandatory, uh, and Skye, how about Guitar Hero Journey?

1724
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Uh, you know I'm down with that. By the way,

1725
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Rob's not gonna stop believin'.

1726
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Did you hear, I'm not stopping believin', did you hear the Journey is going to be in town?

1727
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
How are they?

1728
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
With heart.

1729
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
What?

1730
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And cheap trick.

1731
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
When?

1732
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Like, soon.

1733
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
We're going, right?

1734
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I don't know, it might be the same weekend as PAX, I have to look it up.

1735
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I'll find out.

1736
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'll look it up.

1737
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I will be angry.

1738
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I'll look it up while we read a story.

1739
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Dude, if there's one thing better than Journey, it's heart and Journey.

1740
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
It's heart.

1741
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I don't care, I don't care.

1742
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
As long as I get my power ballads, I'm happy.

1743
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
SHA100Matt says Guitar Hero Abba.

1744
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
No, that's for my dream pop and music game.

1745
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
That would be like Keyboard Mania.

1746
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Anyhow, sorry, let's move on.

1747
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Yeah, shall we?

1748
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
The full Rock Revolution setlist was released this week.

1749
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
You know, the Konami game we were teasing a little bit in Parday.

1750
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Yeah, I know.

1751
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Here's the thing, there's only 41 songs on it.

1752
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Apparently none of them are originals, at least that's what we've heard.

1753
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
A spreadsheet went out earlier this week.

1754
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I guess it was actually leaked from the inside.

1755
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Now, here's the thing though.

1756
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It does have some kind of cool things on it.

1757
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Speaking of heart, Magic Man is in the game.

1758
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Which is kind of cool, right?

1759
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Okay, that means I have to get this game now.

1760
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Damn you!

1761
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Damn you, Konami!

1762
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
It's a cover, it could be bad.

1763
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Don't care, she'll go have it.

1764
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
But check this out.

1765
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Come on, Feel the Noise by Quiet Riot is in it.

1766
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Okay, that's cool.

1767
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
That's kind of awesome too.

1768
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Mega Death is in it.

1769
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Which Mega Death?

1770
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Holy Wars, The Punishment Due.

1771
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Ooh.

1772
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Queen with Stone Cold Crazy.

1773
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I love that song.

1774
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister.

1775
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
This is Butt Rock's version.

1776
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Kinda, in a way.

1777
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
It has Blitzkrieg Bot by the Ramones.

1778
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
That's the one they failed to famously on stage at E3.

1779
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Am I Evil?

1780
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Bad Reputation by Joan Jett.

1781
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And just to top it off for fun,

1782
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Sk8er Boi by Avril Lavigne.

1783
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
There you go.

1784
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
And Linkin Park, so it's not totally Butt Rock.

1785
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
All the small things.

1786
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
All of the slash wrist people.

1787
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,000
To go back to the non-gaming related stuff we were talking about just earlier.

1788
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Sure.

1789
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Journey with Heart and Cheap Trick, you were close.

1790
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It is the 27th of September.

1791
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
We're going.

1792
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
We can go.

1793
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
We're going.

1794
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
We are down.

1795
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
And it's at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.

1796
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Guess what else is?

1797
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
What?

1798
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Mountain View?

1799
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
No.

1800
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
There's one in Cali.

1801
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
There's one in Sac too.

1802
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Whatever they call it.

1803
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Sleep Train or Sac Valley.

1804
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
They change the name of it every year.

1805
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
But next month also is Weird Al.

1806
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
That's pretty cool.

1807
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
At the fair.

1808
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I've never seen Weird Al live before.

1809
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
You're coming with us.

1810
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Maybe we should do OLR live at the Journey concert.

1811
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Let's do that.

1812
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Oh my god, that would be fantastic.

1813
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I don't know if it's possible.

1814
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
We'll find a way.

1815
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
We'll go record in the bathroom.

1816
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Concord Pavilion, the 24th.

1817
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I know they're coming to Sleep Train Amphitheater.

1818
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Look it up.

1819
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Look it up at the Sac Valley thing.

1820
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I'll look it up later.

1821
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
So, can I do my story?

1822
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Yes, Jamie, just do your story and I will look up Journey and Heart.

1823
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
So, they're not as, you know, didn't go through their massive 80s-tastic mode because Ozzy

1824
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
always rocks.

1825
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:06,000
But there is going to be Ozzy in Guitar Hero World Tour.

1826
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
We actually have some tracks released today.

1827
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And the two Ozzy songs are going to be Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley.

1828
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Other tracks announced is Airborne, Too Much, Too Young, At the Drive-In, One-Armed Sister,

1829
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Scissor, sorry, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Weapon of Choice, Bob Seger, Hollywood Nights,

1830
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Dinosaur Jr., Philipine, I love Dinosaur Jr., I'm sorry.

1831
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
We also have Silver Sun Pickups, Lazy Eye, System of the Down, BYOB, Survivor, Eye of

1832
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
the Tiger, Rob, Eye of the Tiger.

1833
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Sorry, I'm sitting here, it's September 26th.

1834
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
We're going.

1835
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Friday.

1836
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Friday night.

1837
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
We're going.

1838
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
We're going, we're there.

1839
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
That's the one in Wheatland, right?

1840
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yeah.

1841
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It's called Stillborn and other tracks that were previously announced, just to repeat

1842
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
those for the listeners, Billy Idol, Rebel Yell, which I'm like, hell yeah.

1843
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,040
Blink 182, Dammit, Foo Fighters Everlong, which, you know, that's going to make Drew

1844
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,700
all pee himself or something.

1845
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,040
It makes me all pee myself.

1846
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,040
I love that song.

1847
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,040
Foo Fighters are pretty awesome.

1848
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,040
So Jimmy Hendrix songs.

1849
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,040
That makes me happy.

1850
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:17,760
Purple Haze, the live version, Wind Cries Mary, Linkin Park, What Have I Done, Paramore

1851
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,240
Misery Business, Sublime Santeria, I'm going to yawn so bad for that one.

1852
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,240
I'm so over sublime.

1853
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,240
Yeah.

1854
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,240
It's really old blade.

1855
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,800
The Doors, Love Me Two Times.

1856
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,800
That's a good one.

1857
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:32,720
The Eagles Hotel, California, and Van Halen, Hot for Teacher.

1858
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,720
I'm sorry.

1859
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:37,920
I'm not the biggest fan of the David Lee Roth era, but I love Hot for Teacher.

1860
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,360
That was a good, that was a fun one.

1861
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:45,280
I love When I Kissed the Teacher by Abba.

1862
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,280
Nevermind.

1863
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,120
You know, I've got, I've got a present for you from Ronma at my house.

1864
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,120
What's that?

1865
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,120
I have an Abba album.

1866
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,120
Awesome.

1867
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,120
Album.

1868
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,120
Like old art and everything.

1869
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,120
Yeah.

1870
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,080
Maybe we can put that in the blank space on Justin TV.

1871
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,760
And he got you a Bette Midler album.

1872
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:01,840
I'm not as big on Bette Midler, but my mother is, so I'll go take that to her.

1873
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,160
He got you Super Trooper.

1874
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,160
Oh, awesome.

1875
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,160
Anyway.

1876
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,160
Sorry.

1877
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,160
Yeah.

1878
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,160
Orange Lounge, Abba-oh.

1879
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:11,240
It's Abba Lounge Radio.

1880
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,120
Loki save the show, please.

1881
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:19,280
Since we were talking about Rock Band earlier, and I mentioned that we were going to be talking

1882
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,280
about street dates.

1883
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:26,280
Well, the street dates apparently were leaked out of some database somewhere.

1884
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,120
The dates that they have- It wasn't you, was it?

1885
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,120
It wasn't me.

1886
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,120
God.

1887
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,120
I don't do that sort of thing.

1888
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,120
Anymore.

1889
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,120
Shh.

1890
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,120
Quiet you.

1891
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:41,120
And he doesn't do it any less.

1892
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,120
Ahaha.

1893
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:46,480
So, according to this database, which I think- I want to say that it was Fred Meyer or something

1894
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,480
like that.

1895
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:50,360
Maybe it was Blockbuster.

1896
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,560
Probably Blockbuster.

1897
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:59,720
The 360 version they have coming out September 24th, the PS3 October 19th, and the Wii November

1898
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,480
18th.

1899
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:06,520
That is about half true.

1900
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:10,960
Oh, really?

1901
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,040
That's not entirely correct.

1902
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:18,600
Is there a certain element of that that might be incorrect?

1903
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,220
The dates for those systems are correct.

1904
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:24,000
They just don't mention one thing.

1905
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,760
In September, the game only version for Xbox 360 is coming out, and the accessories are

1906
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,720
coming out by themselves.

1907
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:36,360
The bundle's not coming out until the PS3 date, which is the same time the PS3 will

1908
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,920
be getting the standalone and the bundle.

1909
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:39,920
That actually makes sense.

1910
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,120
Because they're rushing the game out.

1911
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:49,360
And then the Wii version is coming out November 18th along with the PlayStation 2 version.

1912
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,360
And now you know.

1913
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,120
They were close, but you know.

1914
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,120
Not close enough.

1915
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,260
They're probably getting the game only version.

1916
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:58,080
What about the achievements and trophies in the game?

1917
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:02,740
Well, the achievements and trophies are going to be very similar to the last game.

1918
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:13,040
They have trophies for playing 100% on a song on expert for guitars, drums, vocals, bass.

1919
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,700
Also for doing a Flawless Guitar Solo.

1920
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:21,200
They also have some for the band World Tour Mode, including one for reaching one million

1921
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,880
fans.

1922
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:31,920
They have some stuff for the actual drum trainer, including completing some different beats

1923
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,100
and stuff like that.

1924
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:38,480
And then of course they have some drum challenge achievements and stuff like that.

1925
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,400
It looks very similar to the first game.

1926
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:44,480
Hopefully now that Band Tour is supposed to be online playable, so I can play it with

1927
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,720
friends of mine and not have to have everybody over, I'll actually be able to unlock some

1928
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,720
of those achievements.

1929
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,720
Yeah.

1930
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,680
Because I don't have the full thing, so I've never got those achievements.

1931
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,720
I'm counting on my friend who plays Rock Band a lot more than I do to play my copy and get

1932
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:56,720
me the achievements.

1933
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:57,720
I'll play it with you.

1934
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,040
You should come over one day and we'll get all those achievements.

1935
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,140
I need to get that kit.

1936
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,640
I need to get that kick-ass drum set.

1937
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,280
You just have to learn how to drum.

1938
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,280
Exactly.

1939
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,280
All right.

1940
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,000
Well, onto a completely different note.

1941
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,520
This has nothing to do with music games whatsoever, although you might say these two are making

1942
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,240
music together.

1943
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:18,240
This is from a post on these forums, MMORPG.com.

1944
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:23,520
They're talking about the game Age of Conan and this user, I don't know if the user themselves

1945
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,520
did it.

1946
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:27,240
I don't think they did, but they're posting screenshots from the Age of Conan game where

1947
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:34,120
apparently one of these players who plays a male character in the game had cybersex

1948
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,240
with the GM.

1949
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,760
There's no real way to say this.

1950
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,680
And I was going to have Loki and I do the banter here back and forth, but somehow I

1951
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:43,480
don't think I'm going to be able to get him to do it.

1952
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,520
So let me just give you some of the quotes.

1953
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,520
What?

1954
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,520
Admit it.

1955
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,520
It would be funny.

1956
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,680
We could pretend we're having the chat and read the quotes.

1957
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:51,680
Yeah.

1958
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,200
I don't think we'll give the fanboys that kind of fodder.

1959
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:58,560
Unfortunately, if we did that, who knows what PSA we would receive next week.

1960
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,560
Well, okay.

1961
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:03,480
They posted these screenshots here and apparently they were, they were cybering a little bit

1962
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:09,560
with the GM and look, here's some of the quotes from here.

1963
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:13,960
The player with dual wheeled barbarians though, I mean two, that's a bit difficult for me

1964
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:14,960
to handle.

1965
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:20,200
I'd rather stick with one big sword and the GM says, you like it rough, I take it.

1966
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,160
The player says, be gentle.

1967
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:27,800
The GM says, are you a real woman, lol, not crazy question, you would be surprised.

1968
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,080
And the player says, yep, I just play a male character so guys don't flirt with me in game

1969
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,720
like on wow.

1970
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:37,680
And the GM says, I'm wearing panties, joke.

1971
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,880
Then they get summoned to a special area where, look at this, there's a screenshot of the

1972
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,880
GM that's completely naked.

1973
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,000
Well, I mean, as naked as you can get in an MMO, only wearing undies and nothing else

1974
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
there.

1975
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,640
And the player's just kind of sitting down chilling or what have you.

1976
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:54,160
And they're going on here.

1977
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,720
The player says, whip out your massive sword.

1978
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:01,520
And the GM says, rofl, lol, you like, and so on and so on.

1979
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:05,840
Where does it get really bad here, towards the end it gets really bad.

1980
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,000
The GM ends up saying, hmm, you are bad, what if I rip your panties off and fuck you hard

1981
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,680
until I'm satisfied.

1982
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:18,640
Wanna feel you get really, wait, this is of course cyber chat, so the grammar's all horrible.

1983
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:23,600
Want to feel you get really wee so I can put it just ahead of my you know what, inside

1984
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,440
you, and use my hand to slowly move it around before plunging it fully into you and making

1985
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,000
you take it all.

1986
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Wow.

1987
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,720
I mean, that's a GM in the game.

1988
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:37,800
As you can probably imagine, this guy got canned, but here's the part that's kind of

1989
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,680
irritating.

1990
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,560
So the whole thing was a big joke.

1991
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:46,120
The player then suddenly yells, this is Sparta.

1992
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:49,360
You're so kinky, you just cybered with a dude.

1993
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:55,280
And then the GM says, lol, why did you want this then, are you gay, are you serious, and

1994
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,760
then the player says, serious about what?

1995
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,680
I was joking about the fapping, but then I am indeed the dude.

1996
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:05,560
And the GM says, lol, okay, glad I put my clothes back on.

1997
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:10,600
And then the player says, yeah, probably a good idea, I have AIDS.

1998
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:18,040
Like, you had me going here like at the lolsy factor, but then like this is the equivalent

1999
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:21,360
of me getting up on stage and telling this like hilarious joke.

2000
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:25,120
Like imagine I'm Ellen DeGeneres and I come out on stage and I'm really funny and everybody's

2001
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:29,640
laughing and I'm making jokes at people's expenses and then at the very end of my show

2002
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:33,680
I take my pants off and I poop live on stage.

2003
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:38,280
Like that's kind of what happened here is that, you know, lol, you had to end it with

2004
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:41,200
the haha gay AIDS joke.

2005
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:47,080
Like you suck and it's not funny and, you know, this poor guy probably got fired over

2006
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:51,500
what you did and posting all these things on the internet and if you wanted to be funny

2007
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,560
that wasn't the way to go about doing it.

2008
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:58,600
So you can suck it and you make me very angry and therefore we're going to do the FUs of

2009
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,600
the week.

2010
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,600
Oh, I'm sorry, do you have a comment, Dark Saga?

2011
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,600
I did have a comment.

2012
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,600
Oh, go ahead, sorry.

2013
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:09,400
First of all though, that's a big pile of mutual stupidity so I don't feel sorry for

2014
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,400
either of them.

2015
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,920
The GM's no dumber than you are, my friend.

2016
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,600
Not you, I know I'm looking at you but I mean the user.

2017
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:22,880
The user first of all is an asshole and also pretty much dumb fuck for the little comment

2018
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:28,760
at the end but the GM should have been a GM in the first place if, you know, they were

2019
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:34,920
going to basically act inappropriately especially, and now if it's like a private server that's

2020
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:41,440
one thing but if this is a public server where someone is technically as an employee for

2021
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:46,280
said company, they are a representative of the company, they should know better.

2022
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,280
Exactly.

2023
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:51,720
Amaze Satsuma in chat says pooping on stage is still better than Carrot Top.

2024
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:52,720
Yeah.

2025
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:57,560
Look, you get my analogy, all right, even if you have to be a smart ass about it.

2026
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:02,120
All right, now I'm still angsty, I still have enough residual angst, hopefully Dark

2027
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:15,560
Saga does two to the FUs of the week.

2028
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:20,880
My FU of the week goes towards a hormone, that's it.

2029
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:21,880
Damn those hormones.

2030
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:22,880
Loki.

2031
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:28,120
All right, FU of the week goes to my high school reunion, the 10 year high school reunion.

2032
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:32,520
What a complete fucking waste of time and money.

2033
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:37,440
Just a note for all you people maybe still in high school and thinking, hey, you know,

2034
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,200
10 years from now I can go see all my friends again.

2035
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:44,400
Don't do it, seriously, I mean about 30 or 40 people show up and they're probably the

2036
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:48,440
people that you weren't friends with anyways, just keep in touch with your friends.

2037
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:54,560
Me and myself, I don't really have a whole lot of FUs of the week, I had a fairly decent

2038
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,560
week.

2039
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,560
Raph, if I kick you will you have an FU?

2040
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,560
Yes I will, I will have an FU, FU to the ferret, it stinks.

2041
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:08,600
No I know I had a bad, I FU to drama, believe it or not, because there has been drama recently

2042
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,400
and it's no fun at all.

2043
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,800
Drama's poopy.

2044
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,040
Drama is poopy, drama is no fun.

2045
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,560
Save the drama for your llama.

2046
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,560
A gun is no fun.

2047
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:17,560
Yes they are.

2048
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,600
I have a character on WoW called Drama Llama.

2049
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,800
Guns are lots of fun.

2050
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,920
Unless, you know, guns are fun unless you're shooting people with guns, then they're not

2051
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:25,920
fun.

2052
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,920
Do you know?

2053
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:31,040
But shooting cats with guns is hilarious, no I'm kidding, don't do that, it's not funny.

2054
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,520
I believe in everyone should have a gun.

2055
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,080
I'm serious.

2056
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,280
I'm completely in the opposite, here we go in the political stuff again, because I don't

2057
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,280
agree with you here.

2058
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,640
I'm gonna say one thing about that, just to see what you think.

2059
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,320
Promise me we can get back to gaming after that, alright.

2060
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:50,440
Do you think that most people are good?

2061
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,440
Most people.

2062
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:57,720
If everybody had a gun, a concealed weapon, whether they carried it or not, do you think

2063
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,560
that someone would be more likely to do a violent crime on someone who may or may not

2064
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,240
be armed?

2065
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,320
I don't want the responsibility that comes with a gun.

2066
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:07,120
You don't have to have it, but a lot of people have it.

2067
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:10,040
I don't trust the 1% of people who shouldn't have guns.

2068
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:13,840
But do you think that 1% of the population is gonna be stupid enough to attack the rest

2069
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,440
of the population who might be armed?

2070
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,440
I don't know.

2071
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,440
I don't know.

2072
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,840
That's all I ever have to tell anyone to think about it.

2073
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,840
It shouldn't have to come to that.

2074
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,840
Alright.

2075
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,840
I'm thinking.

2076
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,840
Ow.

2077
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,480
Oh, don't hurt yourself.

2078
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,840
There's other people to hurt you for you.

2079
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:37,960
Anyway, well you know one of my favorite games ever is a Hudson game called Star Prodia,

2080
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:38,960
right?

2081
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:43,600
And I hate that they're putting it out, they're naming it Prodior, because I'm just used to

2082
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,600
it being Star Prodia.

2083
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,960
But it's coming out on Virtual Console.

2084
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:53,320
Hudson says it's going to be on the, I do believe, this Monday's release.

2085
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,360
So that's pretty cool.

2086
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:56,920
That is if they're true to their word.

2087
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:02,080
Well, we didn't get East Book 1 and 2 when it was supposed to be out.

2088
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,440
But Star Prodia and Break In are going to be on Virtual Console.

2089
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:09,000
And I know I've mentioned this plenty of times before.

2090
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,080
Star Prodia is a parody of Star Soldier.

2091
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:20,680
And it's a game where you, basically, you can play as the Twinbee, or you can play as

2092
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:26,320
Bomberman, or you can play as a flying PC Engine and shoot things with HuCards and CDs.

2093
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,000
That is awesome.

2094
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,160
Guns that shoot HuCards I approve of.

2095
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,160
Hell yeah.

2096
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:32,160
Okay.

2097
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,160
But I'm done.

2098
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:34,160
Cool.

2099
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:35,840
Well, hopefully those games actually come out.

2100
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,080
Because I've never played this Star Prodia game, and I always hear Dark Soccer rave about

2101
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,080
it.

2102
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:44,240
So I'm kind of curious to check it out someday.

2103
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,240
Yeah.

2104
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,720
Well, there's some other interesting things coming out.

2105
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:54,160
These aren't exactly legitimate releases, but still something that's being worked on.

2106
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:58,400
I think we talked about this a while back, but it was under a different name.

2107
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:04,260
I believe last time it was Super Mario Brothers Fusion, which was a game that's fusing kind

2108
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:11,280
of Super Mario Brothers with Halo, Metroid, Mega Man, in fact they had recreated Aquaman's

2109
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,280
stage and stuff like that.

2110
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:16,400
Well, now this whole thing has snowballed into one giant game, including a bunch of

2111
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:21,240
other characters, and it's now called Mushroom Kingdom Fusion.

2112
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,940
And it's got 12 playable characters now.

2113
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:30,320
You can actually play as Arthur from Ghouls and Ghosts, you can play as Sonic, Tails,

2114
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:36,560
Luigi, Wario, Kirby, Zelda, or I should say Link, Samus, etc.

2115
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,560
Tingle?

2116
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,040
No Tingle.

2117
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,040
Fail.

2118
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:44,520
But they have all sorts of game references in this, a bunch of different custom levels,

2119
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,600
it's all fan-made, a bunch of different power-ups.

2120
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,160
It's Fangasm the game.

2121
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,160
It pretty much.

2122
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:57,480
You can actually download the beta of this, which I still get to run on my PC because

2123
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:04,480
it's very un, I don't know, they just haven't finished yet.

2124
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,400
It's still in beta, it's not optimized yet.

2125
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,480
Yeah, not optimized one bit.

2126
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:13,520
But if you do get to run though, it is pretty awesome, they do have a beta you can check

2127
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,520
out that includes a lot of the game that's already done right now.

2128
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:23,440
Some of the more recent stuff they did, they have power-ups you can get, including, for

2129
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:27,640
example, if you get the Mega Man power-up, if you're playing Mario, Mario becomes Mega

2130
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:35,920
Mario, Luigi becomes Proto Luigi, Sonic becomes Quick Man, and Tails becomes Gyro Man Tails,

2131
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:36,920
which is interesting.

2132
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:40,240
Interesting is a good word for it.

2133
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:43,880
And they have actually a website dedicated to it, a whole little wiki and stuff, including

2134
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,720
all the games that they reference in it and have different levels.

2135
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:51,220
There's some obscure shit in this, I mean, it's really cool though, and definitely worth

2136
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:52,220
checking out.

2137
01:39:52,220 --> 01:40:01,680
If you want to check out the game, check out any information on it, the website is mkfusion.ipbfree.com.

2138
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:02,680
Ipfreely.com?

2139
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:03,680
What?

2140
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:04,680
I.P.B.

2141
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:05,680
I.P.B.

2142
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,680
I.P.B.

2143
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,680
Free.

2144
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,680
I.P.B.

2145
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:09,680
Free.

2146
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:10,680
So.

2147
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,680
Alright.

2148
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,680
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

2149
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,720
Huh, I'll have to check this game out when they fix some of their memory problems.

2150
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,640
It sounds interesting, but it sounds like what would happen if the fans made Super Smash

2151
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,640
Brothers, that's what would happen.

2152
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:26,560
Hey, talk about legitimate games though, this one's legitimate and something the fanboys

2153
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,560
definitely want.

2154
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,680
Raiden 4 is going to be coming out for the Xbox 360.

2155
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:34,360
That has been announced by Moss, who is the developer of Raiden 4.

2156
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:39,400
They are porting the old arcade shoot-em-up to the Xbox 360, and apparently they're actually

2157
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,960
going to put new aircrafts in the game through download content.

2158
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,440
The game comes out September 11th in Japan.

2159
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,480
The game soundtrack is supposed to be included with the game as well, so that's pretty cool.

2160
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,480
Raiden 4.

2161
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,480
You a Raiden 4 fan, DarkSakura?

2162
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,480
I know you like your shoot-em-ups.

2163
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:57,800
Actually, I was just having a discussion with Dan about Raiden Fighters, so yeah, I'm pretty

2164
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:58,800
cool about that.

2165
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,800
Awesome.

2166
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,840
Alright, well we're really cool whenever we get emails from you guys.

2167
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:06,320
You make us feel special when you email us at Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

2168
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,680
Sadly, we feel kind of sucky this week, because not a lot of you guys emailed us, and we're

2169
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:14,380
not feeling the love, and I'm going to go cry now, but DarkSakura will read those few

2170
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:20,320
emails we did get this week, right now.

2171
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:29,800
First email is from GS68, Hey OLR Crew, about the issue of Wii storage space, I'm not sure

2172
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:34,400
if this has been brought up yet, but can't you put VC games on an SD card and then put

2173
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:37,120
them back on your Wii when you want to play them again?

2174
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,880
Is there something wrong with that?

2175
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:43,160
Not saying you're dumbasses or anything, just wondering why you can't transfer your VC games

2176
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,800
onto an SD card, does that take too long or is it too inconvenient?

2177
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,360
PS, this email was brought to you by Justin TV, home of the never-ending spammers and

2178
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,360
assholes.

2179
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:56,080
Yes, on the it's too inconvenient part, it's a little silly that your Wii can read from

2180
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:00,720
it, but yet it can't read data from it, and access ga- it's like not being able to run

2181
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:04,800
a pi- imagine this, every time you wanted to look at pictures on a USB card, you had

2182
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,440
to copy them to your computer to view them, you couldn't view them right off your USB

2183
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:11,360
card, that's kind of annoying, you know what I mean?

2184
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:15,000
That's kind of the analogy there, like it's just a little silly that the games won't run

2185
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
off it.

2186
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,040
I'll be honest, I didn't realize that you could save them on an SD card, I would actually

2187
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:25,280
back them up that way myself, but the reason being is I would take the ones that after

2188
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:30,820
I had played them for a while, those I would be- I would back up and set those aside, so

2189
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:35,800
that if I wanted to play them, you know, later on, like you know like for example if I was

2190
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:40,080
playing like a lot of Alien Crush, I wouldn't move Alien Crush off there, but if say I played

2191
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:45,440
through you know, what's another one on there, Blaster Master, and was kind of tired of it?

2192
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,720
Not yet, but someday.

2193
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:52,040
I'm just picking, I think, arbitrary title, you know, so that would be the case that I

2194
01:42:52,040 --> 01:43:00,920
think that that could be okay, but if it's- if you're- but not in a- I just want to, you

2195
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:04,160
know, do this every time with every game.

2196
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:07,880
AlphaCananagram has a good point, he says, it just takes too long to copy back on the

2197
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:10,040
Wii, especially Nintendo 64 games.

2198
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,040
Oh, that's a good point.

2199
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,040
Mm-hmm.

2200
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:18,320
God, I wonder how- how those, um, uh, TurboGrafx CD games would be.

2201
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,600
Don't know, don't know.

2202
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,120
It's just a little silly, it's not supported yet, I don't know if the slot access is too

2203
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:26,800
slow, but it's just- it's- it's the principle.

2204
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,840
That's all.

2205
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:31,240
Next email, this is from Saltek.

2206
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:36,080
Hey, OLR, I just wanted to point out one thing the R4 has done for Nintendo.

2207
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:40,360
Out of the five people I know who own DS's for them bought it only because of the R4,

2208
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,360
myself included.

2209
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:47,160
Nintendo is going to make money because the R4, um, because the R4 since they make money

2210
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:52,880
on every DS sold, where it is really bad for the third party developers because people

2211
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,840
will not be purchasing those games, which is unfortunate, but happens when devices like

2212
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,520
this are released.

2213
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:02,200
Keep up the great work and I apologize if my grammar sucks, but I'm very bad at writing,

2214
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,200
Saltek.

2215
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,560
That's okay, I forgive you.

2216
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,660
This time.

2217
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,580
To be honest, I think you're kind of in the minority though.

2218
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:10,620
You and your friends are probably kind of a group of hackers, you know, in the sense

2219
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:15,400
that you enjoy these types of things, you know, in the systems, that's part- you know,

2220
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:20,520
you probably also bought a PSP so you could play NES games on it, I could be wrong, but

2221
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:26,400
do realize you and your friends are not the mass gamer, if that makes sense.

2222
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,520
But I don't- I'm not saying I disagree with you, I'm just saying, you know, you can't

2223
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:33,920
say that four out of all five gamers only bought a DS for the R4, that's the thing.

2224
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:34,920
That's the one point I'm trying to make.

2225
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,960
But, you know, I don't think the R4 is a bad device when used appropriately.

2226
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,600
I am all for breaking region locks.

2227
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,120
I am all for that.

2228
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:47,240
Well, the next and last email I should say, well, you know, I'm actually going to be kind

2229
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:51,560
and check and see if there's one more email because I am kind.

2230
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:59,200
And actually, we did get one, dun dun dun, but I'll read that next.

2231
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:05,400
OLR, I was checking to see if OLR has any events or special guests for the 300th show

2232
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:09,720
and if there's any room in the studio slash garage I would like to attend pending travel

2233
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,680
arrangements slash work.

2234
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,400
Here is some of the reasons which can earn me a spot in the studio as an attendee slash

2235
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:16,400
guest.

2236
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,360
This person's very fond of slashes.

2237
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:23,280
Having met Dark Sakura, must meet Sky and Loki to complete meeting the trifecta of OLR

2238
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,280
hosts.

2239
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:28,680
Gave DMN a ride home 35 miles from the arcade, somehow triggering the random chain of events

2240
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:35,480
which would include Dark Sakura paying for one of my games of DDR the following month.

2241
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:36,960
I play DDR.

2242
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,520
I am possibly, probably one of the oldest skilled DDR players, I've just turned 31 and

2243
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,760
I can keep up with people nearly half my age.

2244
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:48,440
This one, great seeing close pick on my summer love is an indication I might have to see

2245
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:52,640
OLR live in order to AAA that song.

2246
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:55,880
I have DDR player as my license plate on my car.

2247
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:58,480
I must pay tribute to the fairy.

2248
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:05,400
Those are just a few reasons to be there during the 300th show in some form or another, lol.

2249
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:08,960
This email was brought to you by Olive Garden, home of the never ending Olive Garden insert

2250
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:13,720
contextual question mark pound 78 dot track dot google dot com.

2251
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,560
Peace out and AAA Jammer J.

2252
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:20,000
I'm going to be honest, I haven't even thought about the 300th episode yet, it's still two

2253
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,320
months off.

2254
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:24,120
There's PAX kind of in the way.

2255
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:25,560
It's going to be a little while.

2256
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,960
Yeah I saw the pictures.

2257
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:32,840
You my friend are a DDR fan if I ever see one.

2258
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:34,120
I don't know.

2259
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,120
It's a big question mark right now.

2260
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:36,120
We'll see.

2261
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,120
More to come.

2262
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:38,120
What do you guys want us to do for our 300th episode?

2263
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:40,460
Wow what a nice perfect attack on my summer love.

2264
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:42,520
What do you guys want to see us do for our 300th episode?

2265
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,520
I don't know.

2266
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,360
I want pizza and beer and ice cream.

2267
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,360
We'll see.

2268
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:50,080
I want to go back real quick because I'm an idiot and I got called out on it in chat.

2269
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:53,360
Game Guru says the DS has no region lock and duh I should know that.

2270
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:56,920
I've seen the import games for sale right on the store shelves next to the American

2271
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:57,920
games.

2272
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,400
What the hell I was smoking.

2273
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:03,020
I'll be honest I don't use the DS a lot for region locks.

2274
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:06,400
It's more for the Playstation games where I'd like to get around it.

2275
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:10,640
But I'm thinking duh I've played Owen Don on my DS I should know better.

2276
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,120
But anyhow.

2277
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:16,680
I have Owen Don on my DS I bought puppies from him.

2278
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:22,660
So sorry anyway as far as the 300th episode to be to be determined don't know.

2279
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:25,920
We're always welcoming of other people in the studio but you know just try to give us

2280
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,240
a little advance warning.

2281
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:30,960
Plus I would honestly you really want to come out here just for the show.

2282
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:35,360
I mean if you're going to go to San Francisco and do some tourism around there cool but

2283
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,120
it's not even worth it to fly out here just for our little thing.

2284
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:40,400
You can call in on Skype.

2285
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:46,040
I mean I'm not trying to you know just being honest we're not that exciting people.

2286
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,040
We're simple people.

2287
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:50,400
We're like Amish people right Dark Soccer with video games.

2288
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:54,960
Are we are we video game-ish?

2289
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,040
Video game Amish?

2290
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,040
Video game Amish?

2291
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,040
One more email.

2292
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,040
There is something.

2293
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,040
Someone snuck in.

2294
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,040
Comments from chat.

2295
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:05,360
Act Def says episode 300 should be on Mexico tequila tacos and more JV Mons and he is from

2296
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:09,680
Mexico so we can he can try to lobby us to get there just like JV Mons doing episode

2297
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:12,760
300 should be in New York City.

2298
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,280
Frisbee says episode 300 should be in space.

2299
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,120
Look I said things we can realistically do.

2300
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:21,360
I think OLR in space is not going to happen.

2301
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,080
Like the ring of that.

2302
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,080
Nice.

2303
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,080
OLR in space.

2304
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,800
All right one more email.

2305
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:34,880
Okay last one says hi folks since I just got an Xbox 360 Elite on August 2nd I have some

2306
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,780
questions for you mainly directed at Rob since I know he has a 360 but Loki and Dark Soccer

2307
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:40,320
can feel free to chime in too.

2308
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,320
Oh well thank you so much for your permission.

2309
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:47,480
I know it's nice that the listeners give you permission.

2310
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:51,680
One for those in my situation where we both have the PS3 and a 360 is it worth getting

2311
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:57,040
the same multi platform games over again if we already have the given game on one of the

2312
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,040
consoles.

2313
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:01,760
For example Call of Duty 4, Rock Band, etc.

2314
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:02,760
Nah.

2315
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:03,760
No.

2316
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:08,440
If you must sell your other one back at least get some credit for it before you buy the

2317
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:10,840
other one if you feel you must.

2318
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:14,720
This is how some games try to milk money out of you though is by trying to entice you to

2319
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:18,400
buy it again like Soul Calibur 4 the whole Vader Yoda thing.

2320
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,400
Hello.

2321
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:24,920
Although I liked your theory about buying that other game to get both unlocked.

2322
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:28,040
It's very likely.

2323
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,520
My simple answer is no.

2324
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,720
I'll ask him.

2325
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,960
Rarely is that type of thing worth it.

2326
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:34,960
I can't think of a lot.

2327
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:38,000
I mean sometimes the game might really have a lot extra when it comes out on the other

2328
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,600
console like it sounds like Bioshock might have but even then I would want to sell my

2329
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:45,800
Bioshock on 360 back if I'm going to get it on PlayStation 3 which is actually not something

2330
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:50,200
I would do in the real world but you know at least do that.

2331
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,280
Well moving right along to the next question.

2332
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:58,040
If you could come up with a top 5 list of games for a 360 owner should have what games

2333
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:59,040
would those be?

2334
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:03,080
If you like you can have separate lists for disc based games, Xbox Live, arcade games.

2335
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:06,680
I'm going to go ahead and tell you a few that I have.

2336
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:09,320
First of all get Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

2337
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,600
I love the hell out of that game.

2338
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,480
And the second one's coming out too.

2339
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,680
So it's lots of fun.

2340
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:18,960
Dead Rising you can you know kill zombies with a lawn mower.

2341
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,400
That's fun for five seconds.

2342
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:25,400
Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live Arcade.

2343
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:26,400
Uno.

2344
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:34,840
God what else was it that we were playing?

2345
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:35,840
My brain blanked.

2346
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:36,840
That's right.

2347
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:37,840
I'll jump in.

2348
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,520
The Xbox Live Arcade as far as that goes.

2349
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,200
I've played almost everything on there.

2350
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:46,200
I would say Braid, Geometry Wars 2 which I know just both came out but they're both excellent

2351
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,200
games.

2352
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:53,800
Rez, Symphony of the Night if you don't already have access to it on PlayStation.

2353
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:59,200
If you do go Luminous if you've never played it before and you haven't gotten it on any

2354
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:01,320
other console like the PSP.

2355
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:07,000
And yeah I would say something like Uno or go try something a little different like Catan

2356
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,600
or Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride.

2357
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,400
Try one of those games on for size.

2358
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,680
But don't get Yaris.

2359
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:16,160
Yeah don't get don't be enticed by it's free.

2360
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:18,760
Same with Totem Ball.

2361
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:22,840
Any contribution Loki?

2362
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:27,640
I'm sorry I'm being distracted by people saying that I need to be in a Tingle suit for the

2363
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:28,640
300th show.

2364
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:29,640
Silly chat room.

2365
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:30,640
That ain't happening.

2366
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:34,800
Recommend five Xbox 360 games our new listener should pick up.

2367
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,800
Or Xbox Live Arcade.

2368
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:36,800
When are they picking up their 360?

2369
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:37,800
They already did.

2370
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:38,800
They already have it.

2371
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:39,800
Okay.

2372
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:40,800
Um.

2373
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,800
Let's see.

2374
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:46,320
I would do Earth Defense Force 2017.

2375
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:49,760
Hey it's dirt cheap now seriously.

2376
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,800
It's like five bucks or something.

2377
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,800
Alright.

2378
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,800
Alright.

2379
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:54,800
Um.

2380
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:55,800
Crackdown if you want.

2381
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,320
I mean cause that's dirt cheap right now too.

2382
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:58,800
The jumping game.

2383
01:51:58,800 --> 01:51:59,800
Um.

2384
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:01,880
I would say the original Saints Row if you want.

2385
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:03,600
I mean if you.

2386
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,640
I guess that's also dirt cheap.

2387
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:10,760
I agree with JVMon who's flooding Lost Odyssey if you're remotely interested in RPGs.

2388
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:11,760
I guess.

2389
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,520
There's a lot of RPGs coming out though pretty soon so.

2390
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:15,520
Uh.

2391
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,720
Lost Odyssey I guess.

2392
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:20,400
Um.

2393
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,980
Bioshock's good.

2394
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:24,980
And probably.

2395
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:27,460
OMG Halo 3.

2396
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:30,460
Let's move on.

2397
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:31,840
I would not recommend Halo 3.

2398
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:32,840
Call D4.

2399
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:33,840
Alright.

2400
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,840
Is that.

2401
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,840
No.

2402
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:37,840
Alright.

2403
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:38,840
More.

2404
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:39,840
More.

2405
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:40,840
Rob.

2406
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:41,840
Anyway.

2407
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,840
Moving forward.

2408
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:45,320
Have you had any issues with any other players in Xbox Live?

2409
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:46,960
People essentially being annoying or all around a-holes.

2410
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:47,960
When don't I?

2411
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,960
If so what's the best way to deal with that issue?

2412
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:50,960
Don't play with strangers.

2413
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:51,960
Ignore them.

2414
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:52,960
Don't play with strangers.

2415
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:56,880
Build up a friends list of good people and I urge you to start on orangeonshreddy.com

2416
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:01,720
slash forums and if that's not enough for you go visit other forums that you like and

2417
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:05,600
get other Xbox Live gamer tags and don't play with strangers play with friends.

2418
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:07,340
That's the only way you're going to avoid idiocy.

2419
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:11,320
Or make sure that you can play in a game where you make sure you start the game and you can

2420
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:12,560
boot the players.

2421
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:13,560
That's another good tip.

2422
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,560
If you want to meet people.

2423
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,680
That's actually a very good tip.

2424
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:19,520
Also play games that idiots don't understand.

2425
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,200
That's one reason I recommend Catan and Carcassonne.

2426
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:23,200
Play games that idiots don't understand.

2427
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:26,000
To laugh at the idiots instead of being offended by them.

2428
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,880
We did that one time when we played a bunch of people in the UK at Grand Theft Auto IV

2429
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:33,800
and we kicked the crap out of them and they were like spouting all these obscenities and

2430
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:34,800
it was funny.

2431
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:35,800
We were just like ahhh.

2432
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:36,800
They're angry.

2433
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,440
They're swearing with an accent.

2434
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,440
Hahaha.

2435
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,440
Exactly.

2436
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,000
They're using words like you know.

2437
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Oh god.

2438
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,720
I just have to say chat room remind at orange box.

2439
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:47,720
None of us said orange box.

2440
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:48,720
And we really should have.

2441
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:49,720
Yeah.

2442
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:50,720
You need portal.

2443
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:51,720
Alright sorry go ahead.

2444
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:56,640
But I was also going to say it just goes back to what was it I was saying a few weeks ago.

2445
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,280
Learn to be offended.

2446
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,280
I agree to an extent.

2447
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:01,280
They're stupid.

2448
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:02,280
There's so much idiocy on Xbox Live though.

2449
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,360
There's so so much.

2450
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,360
You get.

2451
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,360
It gets old.

2452
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,360
It's funny the first few times.

2453
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:07,780
It gets so old.

2454
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:11,320
I report every single one because I'm that guy.

2455
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:12,320
No.

2456
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:13,640
Last question on here.

2457
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:14,640
Uh huh.

2458
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:18,060
If you don't mind would you please send me a friends list to invite on Xbox Live.

2459
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:21,760
My gamer tag is spazinator on PSN.

2460
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,360
Minus the quotes obviously.

2461
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,360
Okay.

2462
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:26,560
What about Xbox Live?

2463
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,040
This is the Xbox Live one.

2464
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:29,040
Oh okay spazinator.

2465
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,040
There you go.

2466
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:31,040
Spazinator on PSN.

2467
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:35,280
Um sadly my friends list is full and I probably won't ever remember but if you send me a message

2468
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:39,000
asking nicely I'll boot somebody who hasn't been on in like 90 days.

2469
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:45,720
I think mine is DarkSakuraLLR but I never use it because my husband we use his and he

2470
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:51,640
I think he boots everybody I add out so so yeah if anyone has Dan's isn't his Gunstar

2471
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:52,640
underscore hero.

2472
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:54,640
Uh I don't remember to be honest.

2473
01:54:54,640 --> 01:55:00,120
Yeah Dan's is Gunstar hero and he um boots people that he doesn't recognize and so he's

2474
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:05,800
booted some people that I added on there so if you add him and he boots you don't be offended

2475
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,320
it's not me it's my husband.

2476
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,320
Loki are you full yet?

2477
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:11,200
No I think I'm like 70 something.

2478
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:12,980
So Loki O-L-R right?

2479
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,800
Loki space O-L-R all caps.

2480
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:15,800
There you go.

2481
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:20,800
Um thanks for uh taking the time to answer my questions as it's highly appreciated um

2482
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,800
take care.

2483
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,640
That's a really nice letter thank you.

2484
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:27,720
I add everybody but you know don't expect me to play with you during the middle of the

2485
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:34,600
day when I'm at work doing our two 15 minute multiplayer games we'll ignore your invites.

2486
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:37,560
Yeah don't just because yeah that's another thing because this kind of happened lately

2487
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:41,600
is that I I'm without fail I always get invited to games please don't be offended if I turn

2488
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:44,800
them down but keep in mind sometimes when I turn on the Xbox I have a game in mind I

2489
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,320
want to play I don't want to go back like I don't even know where my copy of Halo 3

2490
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,800
is and like from several people I get Halo 3 invites please don't be offended when I

2491
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,800
decline them I just don't that's not the game I feel like playing.

2492
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:57,200
Yeah see I get Grand Theft Auto 4 invites when I'm not playing it and Nellie's playing

2493
01:55:57,200 --> 01:56:02,320
like Zuma or Bejeweled so you know but usually then I'll be smart and I'll make it look like

2494
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,320
I'm offline so.

2495
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,320
Nice.

2496
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,320
You know.

2497
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:06,320
I don't know.

2498
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,320
Alright.

2499
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:11,440
Uh but I do certain random things will happen like uh I got into a random Uno game the other

2500
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:14,920
night with some All Games people and we had a we had a good time Bobby got in on it too

2501
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:15,920
it was fun.

2502
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,400
I'm going you know Grand Theft Auto games every now and then you know I just haven't

2503
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:20,400
lately.

2504
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,400
Right.

2505
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,840
Like right now it's all about Braid right now and Geometry Wars which sadly are not

2506
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,520
multiplayer so uh may if you catch me in a good mood I can do Soul Calibur 4 if you catch

2508
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:34,160

01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:53,480
And then the awards were over!

2540
01:57:53,480 --> 01:58:00,520
I just saved you about 3 hours or 2 hours or however long this damn ceremony goes.

2541
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,880
JV Mon says Grand Theft Auto 4 kinda sucked.

2542
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,120
He's in the minority but Niko is the best video game character in a long time.

2543
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:10,080
It's not that Grand Theft Auto was like super duper awesome I mean cause it was pretty awesome

2544
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:16,640
but Halo 3 wasn't that awesome let me put it that way I don't know it wasn't groundbreaking

2545
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:17,640
I think.

2546
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:21,240
Yeah Halo 3 wasn't quite the like the Halo 2 was.

2547
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,240
Halo 3 new paint job.

2548
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:26,660
I've mentioned this before and this is seriously like I know a lot of people call this the

2549
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:31,600
cop out thing but there's a certain X factor the games need to be graded on a little bit.

2550
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:35,840
You know like I said earlier like Space Giraffe kinda just was missing that uh the Tempest

2551
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:39,440
2000 hat and it's hard to put your finger on what that is but it's like the X factor

2552
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:40,440
you know what I mean?

2553
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:41,440
Yeah.

2554
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:46,960
And that's the same thing with Halo 3 it was just missing that something.

2555
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:53,440
The most descriptive game review you'll ever get in your life uh anyhow chad.orangelandrater.com

2556
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:57,920
if you want to comment on that uh meanwhile hey the long time chatters will love this

2557
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:02,760
an Eye of Judgment tournament who knew that game was still going on actually apparently

2558
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:06,820
it's got its fans they are actually going to be doing a world championships over the

2559
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:12,760
playstation network on August 14th so uh get your playstation eyes hooked up and get ready

2560
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:18,460
to go with your uh official booster packs cause I know you didn't copy cards or nothing.

2561
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:23,720
It's pretty cool it's uh officially happening on the playstation network on August 14th.

2562
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:32,120
You can actually duel uh the creator of Eye of Judgment from Japan Studio if you uh are

2563
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:33,600
so lucky to in this game.

2564
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:36,880
I don't know if they're actually doing like a tournament style thing or if this is one

2565
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:40,360
of those hey why doesn't everybody play this game online at the same time so there's lots

2566
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:41,360
of people playing.

2567
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:46,580
I don't know exactly what it is but uh sounds like it could be interesting.

2568
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:51,440
So there you have it play some Eye of Judgment on August 14th if you actually have it.

2569
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:57,600
Well even so you've got more incentive to be able to uh play Eye of Judgment and this

2570
01:59:57,600 --> 02:00:01,760
is great news for Loki although it's probably not going to help at all.

2571
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:08,240
The Circuit City has um Eye of Judgment and the playstation eye for uh $40.

2572
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:10,880
It's on sale.

2573
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:13,720
And Walmart has it for $30.

2574
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:19,080
Well it's time to go buy those things off the shelves let's start moving them.

2575
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:21,120
I think I might actually go pick up one.

2576
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:24,560
There you go that's one in a million only $999,999 more to go.

2577
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,120
If it's at Walmart for $30 hell yeah I'll get it just to have the webcam.

2578
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:32,040
It's a good price for the uh playstation eye cause I think the playstation eye buy it sells

2579
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:33,040
like $39.99.

2580
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,880
Yeah that's actually really I even I would pick it up just because someday I'll probably

2581
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:37,880
get a playstation through.

2582
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:40,680
I might pick it up to burn it.

2583
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:45,080
Well I'd pick it up to have the webcam cause you can use the webcam on your PC and it's

2584
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,600
better than the webcam I have now.

2585
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:50,480
I don't use my webcam for anything other than taking random pictures but you know.

2586
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:54,360
The webcam we use for OLR's just in TV is an actual video camera at this point.

2587
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:55,760
But we used to use an eye right?

2588
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:57,280
We used to use an eyesight.

2589
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:58,280
That was it.

2590
02:00:58,280 --> 02:00:59,280
That's what we used to use.

2591
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,280
And then it broke cause I dropped it on the ground.

2592
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:02,360
Before that we used to use an eye toy.

2593
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:08,640
We did for a little while use an eye toy that oh man that was back in the day.

2594
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,400
Good times.

2595
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:15,880
So uh lots of Eye of Judgment news around aren't you excited Loki?

2596
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:18,000
I was the one that posted the story so.

2597
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
They're desperate.

2598
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,440
I'm well aware of what's going on in the Eye of Judgment world or the lack thereof of what's

2599
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:27,000
going on in the Eye of Judgment world.

2600
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,280
Well something that's about as ridiculous as playing a card game over your PS3.

2601
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:34,840
How about installing Windows Vista on your PS3?

2602
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,440
Yeah well you can do it.

2603
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,960
That doesn't really mean it's going to work well.

2604
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:46,760
Basically the guy installed a version of Linux on his other partition of his hard drive.

2605
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:51,560
And in Linux emulated Windows Vista.

2606
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:57,400
And well it takes 25 minutes to boot and 5 minutes to access the start menu and about

2607
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:59,200
12 minutes to open Notepad.

2608
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:01,680
12 minutes to open Notepad?

2609
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:03,520
12 minutes to open Notepad.

2610
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:05,920
Power up the cell processor.

2611
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:06,920
Wow.

2612
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:11,960
No but seriously though I mean you're emulating an operating system within an operating system.

2613
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,680
Within an operating system basically.

2614
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:16,000
Misty says my thoughts exactly in chat.

2615
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,640
She says ew it's bad enough on PC.

2616
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:27,800
And to be honest Windows Vista just runs like that so you know really stick with Linux.

2617
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:28,800
There you have it.

2618
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,800
Or Minty.

2619
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:31,800
I almost said Misty Linux.

2620
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:32,800
I bet you'd be excited.

2621
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:33,800
Or Minty Linux.

2622
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:38,040
Well I don't know if you can install Minty Linux on a PS3.

2623
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:41,420
I think it only takes Yellow Dog or something like that.

2624
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:42,600
How about Misty Linux?

2625
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:45,120
Would that be like a OLR based Linux system?

2626
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,120
Misty Linux?

2627
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,120
Misty Linux.

2628
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:48,120
Instead of Minty Linux.

2629
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:49,120
It's like emo Linux.

2630
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:50,120
You know.

2631
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:51,120
Oh my eyes are Misty.

2632
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:52,120
No no.

2633
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:53,560
Like our listener Misty.

2634
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,560
Not like.

2635
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:55,560
Oh forget it.

2636
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:56,560
Yeah I know Misty.

2637
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:57,560
Our listener.

2638
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:58,560
Forget it.

2639
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,560
I got that.

2640
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:00,560
I understood that.

2641
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,560
I was taking the joke further.

2642
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:03,760
But she's Misty after the Pokemon girl with pigtails.

2643
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:06,680
Remember back in the day?

2644
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:07,680
Forget it.

2645
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:08,680
Yeah back in the day when I played Pokemon.

2646
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:11,880
Let me think back to that day.

2647
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:12,880
It doesn't exist.

2648
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,360
I hate you.

2649
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:17,360
Just kidding.

2650
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,360
Just kidding.

2651
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:21,960
But I will like you a whole lot Loki if you get this for me.

2652
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:23,440
It's Little Big Planet.

2653
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,220
Of course you'd have to buy me a PS3 as well.

2654
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:27,220
So get working on that.

2655
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:28,220
Little Big Planet.

2656
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:32,160
If you actually pre-order this game it was revealed by the official US PlayStation blog

2657
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:37,440
that apparently there are five separate pre-order bonuses that you can get in North America.

2658
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:40,360
It all depends on where you're going to reserve the game.

2659
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:45,000
They haven't said where you reserve it will get you what prize just yet.

2660
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,160
But one of them is a Kratos Sackboy.

2661
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:49,800
That's Kratos from God of War.

2662
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:53,520
This little Sackboy which is one of the ugliest fucking looking things I've ever seen in my

2663
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:54,520
life.

2664
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:56,600
I think you get all five if you pre-order.

2665
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:58,800
But that's a lot though.

2666
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:02,240
There's a Sackgirl for Nariko from Heavenly Sword.

2667
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:06,780
There's Little Big Pouch, a burlap sack that can fit a...

2668
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:07,780
That's awesome.

2669
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:09,320
I'm going to pre-order a game and get a burlap sack.

2670
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,320
That's rad.

2671
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:13,880
A Little Big Sticker Book which is a sticker book.

2672
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:20,080
And the official Little Big Planet Creator Guide by Brady Games, but only the mini guide.

2673
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:22,400
It's the little guide for the little game.

2674
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,720
So I wouldn't think you would get...

2675
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:25,880
I think it's kind of cute.

2676
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:26,880
That is ugly.

2677
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:27,880
I bet the Nariko ones better.

2678
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:28,880
Oh, I think it's cute.

2679
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:29,880
To be honest...

2680
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:30,880
It looks like a poop.

2681
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:31,880
To be honest, I am nice.

2682
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:32,880
No, it's good.

2683
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:34,880
Your butt looks like a poop.

2684
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,240
Well, thank you.

2685
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:39,280
I'm not really too excited about the God of War and Heavenly Sword, so...

2686
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:41,960
I was looking at the one for the Heavenly Sword one is actually...

2687
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:46,200
Okay, the burlap sack is like a zipper pouch.

2688
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,560
It's cute.

2689
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:51,480
I would get the Little Big Pouch or the Nariko if it doesn't look as hideous as the Kratos

2690
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,480
one.

2691
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,280
Oh, so cute.

2692
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:55,800
The Heavenly Sword one is really cute.

2693
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:56,800
She looks like a Fraggle.

2694
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:57,800
Well, you...

2695
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:00,960
Now, Fraggles are rad.

2696
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,800
Do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?

2697
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:04,400
Dude, they should.

2698
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:09,480
Loki, do they have a Fraggle Rock video game?

2699
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:11,760
Maybe on like the ColecoVision or something like that.

2700
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:13,720
Okay, they need a new Fraggle Rock game.

2701
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:18,800
Well, you can wait for the remake of the Fraggle Rock, or especially a Fraggle Rock movie.

2702
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:23,760
They're gonna do a remake, I guess, of it or something, and then there'll be a video

2703
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:26,260
game coming out for it.

2704
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:28,520
As long as it doesn't suck.

2705
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:29,520
Right, DarkSakura?

2706
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,580
If it sucks, then it sucks.

2707
02:05:31,580 --> 02:05:34,860
It's gonna be a remake of a series that a lot of people have forgotten about.

2708
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:36,120
I'm sure it's gonna suck.

2709
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:39,520
No one can forget about Fraggle Rock.

2710
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:40,520
Not while I'm around.

2711
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:41,520
Ever.

2712
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:42,520
Ever.

2713
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:48,320
Well, this is something that no one will ever be able to forget once they've heard of it,

2714
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:58,760
is there's a shooter series that stars heavily-muscled men wearing Speedos, and it's called...

2715
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:04,240
It's the Cho-Aniki games, and there is going to be a new Cho-Aniki game on PSP.

2716
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:07,360
Now, that's a series that needs to make a comeback.

2717
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:13,320
Zero Cho-Aniki, which is a remake of the original Cho-Aniki.

2718
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:16,920
And it's funny, the screen capture that I'm looking at looks like they're fighting a very

2719
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:22,640
muscular version of Jack, like Jack in the Box, you know, because he's got the pointy

2720
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:23,640
nose and the eyes.

2721
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:24,640
The big balloon head.

2722
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:25,640
I know!

2723
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:30,260
But he's like, uber muscled, and he's got like a little thingy over his, you know, pee-pee.

2724
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:33,960
Did they wuss out on the subtle gay porn hints, though?

2725
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:36,280
I don't think so at all.

2726
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:43,120
But, you know what, I told my husband in no uncertain terms that I'm importing zero Cho-Aniki.

2727
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:45,400
And you should also tell him that you're going to make him buy it.

2728
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:48,160
I don't know, I told him.

2729
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:49,160
Nice.

2730
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:55,840
Also, my friend who introduced me to Linux Mint says no Mint on PS3 as of yet, sorry.

2731
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:56,840
Darn.

2732
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:58,440
I had to spread that on air.

2733
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:00,280
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.

2734
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:01,280
That's alright.

2735
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:05,920
Game Guru says, also, why, why Cho-Aniki, why?

2736
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:07,520
Because Cho-Aniki is cool!

2737
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:11,600
And Game Guru would also like to point out that the Fragglerock redo is coming from Jim

2738
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:12,880
Hansen and Disney.

2739
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:13,880
So hopefully that's a good sign.

2740
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:15,840
It's coming from beyond the grave.

2741
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:16,840
Exactly.

2742
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:18,720
Thank God.

2743
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:24,720
So there's a couple neat, I guess, mods that have come out for the PSP.

2744
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:32,760
The first is actually someone that has basically put a cell phone inside of a PSP, where the

2745
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:34,540
UMD drive goes.

2746
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:38,080
And so now it's a PSP phone.

2747
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,080
Awesome.

2748
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:41,440
It kind of looks retarded.

2749
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:44,840
But hey, it's a phone and it's a PSP.

2750
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:46,240
Something a little bit more functional, though.

2751
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:49,120
Is there anything this device can't do?

2752
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:54,320
Something a little bit more functional, though, another modder has incorporated a touchscreen

2753
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:56,040
to the PSP.

2754
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:59,020
That a little bit better, I would say.

2755
02:07:59,020 --> 02:08:03,640
And that project now is called the Touchscreen Project for the PSP.

2756
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:11,680
It's on a website called pspzproject.dcemu.co.uk.

2757
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:19,640
Dude, DCEMU, I remember that site.

2758
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,640
That was...

2759
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:23,960
My Dreamcast got more action from that website than any game.

2760
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:24,960
Exactly.

2761
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:28,040
Remember, was it Feed a Fury?

2762
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:30,000
Heck yeah.

2763
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,280
So yeah, it's interesting.

2764
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:39,160
Basically he's allowed it to, I guess, have better battery life somehow.

2765
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:42,040
They've redesigned the control pad and some other crap.

2766
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:45,920
And he's working on a keyboard application for it.

2767
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,440
I don't know, I think that's pretty neat.

2768
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:53,520
It would be kind of cool to have a touchscreen on the PSP, because for the love of God, typing

2769
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,800
on that thing sucks.

2770
02:08:55,800 --> 02:09:01,400
Alright, so wow, we've had Wii hacks and now PSP hacks.

2771
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:05,240
The hackers sure are busy.

2772
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:08,160
We're going to end tonight, before we go to the Skype line, with a story that I know is

2773
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:11,200
going to surprise you guys, it's going to knock the socks off of you.

2774
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:12,720
You're never going to believe it.

2775
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:18,600
But brace yourselves, Grand Theft Auto 4 is coming to the PC, y'all.

2776
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:19,600
What?

2777
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,780
Shock, huh?

2778
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:22,840
I never would have guessed.

2779
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:23,840
That is unheard of.

2780
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:27,920
I never would have guessed, based on the 50 leaks that came out earlier.

2781
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:33,360
Well, Rockstar finally admitting it, saying, quote, we are very excited to be releasing

2782
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:36,000
the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4.

2783
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,000
The whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the PC.

2784
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,600
The game looks and plays beautifully on PC, and we can't wait for people to play it.

2785
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:49,480
It is coming out November 18th in North America, November 21st in Europe.

2786
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:52,520
There is a reason why this is following a story about hacking.

2787
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,920
Oh, yeah.

2788
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,800
That is all I'm going to say.

2789
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:58,040
That is all I'm going to say.

2790
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:59,040
Have fun.

2791
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,760
Just in time for Christmas for the hacking community.

2792
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:01,760
Oh, my god.

2793
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:02,760
It's going to be so awesome.

2794
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:05,960
The other thing, too, what's kind of cool about it, though, is they do have some expanded

2795
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:07,940
multiplayer options in there as well.

2796
02:10:07,940 --> 02:10:11,700
No word on what that is exactly, but there are going to be some new multiplayer features.

2797
02:10:11,700 --> 02:10:15,240
Not that it would matter anyways, because people would add it anyways and recreate all

2798
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:17,400
new cities and all sorts of mods.

2799
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,400
I cannot wait.

2800
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:19,400
Can't wait.

2801
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:20,400
Awesome.

2802
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:24,240
We're going to open up the Skype line now for your calls.

2803
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:27,320
Orange Launch Radio is our username on Skype, or if you're feeling so inclined, you can

2804
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:28,320
pick up the phone.

2805
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:32,120
1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll-free number in the US and Canada.

2806
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:35,360
Unfortunately, if you're overseas, you're going to want to stick to Skype.

2807
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:37,080
We're not going to pay your phone bill, kids.

2808
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:41,080
So 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, is Orange Launch Radio.

2809
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:42,920
We're going to move into some last-minute stories.

2810
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:47,000
I'll start tonight, and I'm not using a source or anything for this, but it's something when

2811
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,860
I was listening to Bobby's show, I heard him mention it, and I realized we neglected to

2812
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:52,560
put it on our own show roll.

2813
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:56,400
Believe it or not, GameTap apparently has gone under.

2814
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:57,400
Did you guys hear this?

2815
02:10:57,400 --> 02:10:59,400
GameTap actually went under this week.

2816
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:00,400
Really?

2817
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,400
Yeah.

2818
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:02,400
Well, I got sold.

2819
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:03,400
I'm sorry.

2820
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:06,040
It didn't implode or go under.

2821
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:07,040
It closed completely.

2822
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,040
No, no, no.

2823
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:10,520
It's being sold as a property out of Turner.

2824
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:14,300
So sorry if I misrepresented that, which is good that apparently the stream went down

2825
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:16,240
right at that moment that I said that.

2826
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:17,240
Did it?

2827
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:18,240
Yeah.

2828
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:19,400
It's back up now, but we had a weird hiccup in the connection.

2829
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:21,120
I was about like, oh.

2830
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:22,960
But anyway, yeah, because the chat room is going crazy.

2831
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:26,040
But anyway, oh shoot, Justin TV caught me saying it.

2832
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:27,040
But yeah, no.

2833
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:30,080
Turner sold it off, or is looking to sell it off apparently.

2834
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:33,360
So we'll see.

2835
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:35,240
Any other last-minute stories while we wait for some calls?

2836
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:39,120
Again, since the stream went dead, 1877 GameoLR, the Skype line is open.

2837
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:40,120
Or username on Skype.

2838
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:41,120
You want to hear something funny?

2839
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:42,120
What, Loki?

2840
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:45,840
Okay, anyways, I was reading up a little bit more on that Mushroom Kingdom fusion.

2841
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,160
They've got a bunch of different levels.

2842
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:51,520
They have the Mushroom Kingdom, Alternate Earth, Mega Man's Realm, the Demon Realm,

2843
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:57,680
which is based on Doom games, Genneta, Shoot Em Up's domain, Realm of the Nintendo, Sonic

2844
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:01,200
Universe, Halo Ring World, Twisted Reality, and Minus World.

2845
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:07,320
But in the Demon World, the boss is Loki.

2846
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:08,480
How appropriate.

2847
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:09,480
Let's go to the Skype line.

2848
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:10,480
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2849
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:11,480
Who's this?

2850
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:12,480
It's the legend, Zaku.

2851
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:13,480
What's up?

2852
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:14,480
Hey, Zaku.

2853
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,480
What's on your mind?

2854
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:16,480
Long time, no talk.

2855
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:17,480
Just random things.

2856
02:12:17,480 --> 02:12:18,480
Let me see.

2857
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:19,480
The fact.

2858
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:24,480
I'm just trying to find some stuff.

2859
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:30,520
Yeah, that whole Mad Knight, which apparently is affecting me and others.

2860
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:32,360
How does Mad Knight affect you?

2861
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:38,120
Well, my, you know, my thugnificent little brother, who plays it out of spite of the

2862
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:43,120
fact that he's all full of the whole hip hop thing, he just plays it because he knows how

2863
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:45,080
to make money off of it.

2864
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:47,920
How exactly do you make money off of Madden?

2865
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:50,880
Through League, through League play.

2866
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:54,840
Are you talking online currency, or are you talking about some type of shady, oh, okay.

2867
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:55,840
Real money.

2868
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:56,840
Real money through Madden.

2869
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:57,840
Yes.

2870
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:58,840
Through League.

2871
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:00,320
He did that through NBA Live recently.

2872
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:06,280
He and a bunch of other players basically did it through MLG and something like that.

2873
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:11,560
I never realized there was this whole underground betting activity going on on Madden and video

2874
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:12,560
games.

2875
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:13,560
Oh, yeah.

2876
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:14,560
It's what you think with Madden and all those others.

2877
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,040
Is your brother making off this?

2878
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:21,840
Well, actually, the team that he's in, he hasn't told me any specifics, but he did make

2879
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:25,800
a lot, but most of the money is going to the team.

2880
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:29,080
What does the team buy, shirts or a whole lot of pot?

2881
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:33,880
No, just to pay off their players, I guess.

2882
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:38,720
I don't get it, so then your brother is making money if he's paying off the players?

2883
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:44,440
Well, he's actually in the League, so he's actually making money, you know, the earnings

2884
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:49,360
are split pretty much amongst all the other players in his team.

2885
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:53,280
So if I get good at Madden, which will never happen, if I get good at Madden, I could make

2886
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:56,880
money off of it on this whole underground gambling circuit?

2887
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,280
Yes, you could.

2888
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:00,240
They do hold those things from what I hear.

2889
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:07,560
They hold them and they pretty much hold the underground Madden sessions where they bet

2890
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:10,880
big dollars for each game.

2891
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:11,880
Underground Madden?

2892
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:16,400
Is it like a rave where a bus comes to pick you up to take you to an unmarked building?

2893
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:22,000
No, it's just at the private meetups, just like, you know, at people's houses where they

2894
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,800
just like, you know, they play Madden for money, which is kind of, you know, I mean,

2895
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:32,160
I can't imagine, you know, any other game, maybe DDR, unless, you know, you put money

2896
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:33,160
on...

2897
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:35,840
Well, I don't see an underground DDR betting circle starting anytime soon.

2898
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:40,480
I mean, it could happen, think about it, you could basically put money on the number of

2899
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:46,320
greats you get, you know, per song, like the less number of greats, you know...

2900
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,920
If there's money to gamble, someone's going to gamble it.

2901
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:50,720
We live in a risk-taking world, I suppose.

2902
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:55,020
God, I don't know why I find this so fascinating, but I do, it's like, I want to see a documentary

2903
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:56,020
done on this shit.

2904
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:59,400
Uh, Zaku, okay, I'll try to get back on top of you, anything else you want to comment

2905
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:00,400
on on tonight's show?

2906
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:01,400
Any of the other stories?

2907
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:07,160
Um, besides digital life being held next month, coinciding with an anime convention also being

2908
02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:13,120
held in the same place, that's pretty much it, you know, next month, digital life, $3,000.

2909
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:14,640
What are you most looking forward to about digital life?

2910
02:15:14,640 --> 02:15:17,520
I know there was a little bit of disappointment all around last year, what are you looking

2911
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,820
for them to most improve, what are you looking forward to this year?

2912
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:25,480
I have no idea, I just want to, I don't know, if there's, if they have more, you know, they

2913
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:30,080
have more like game, you know, game developers showing up instead of all this other like

2914
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:35,760
marketing crap, I mean, besides all the schwag that you get for free, you know, you could

2915
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:40,040
use a, could use a few more games, like in 06, which was really good, they had like the

2916
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:43,360
Wii and everything, you know, before it came out.

2917
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:47,080
Alright, alright, well, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but

2918
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:52,040
thanks for calling in, and uh, um, good luck to your brother, hope he can make your family

2919
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:53,040
a lot of money.

2920
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:56,140
Yeah, I hope so too, maybe, I don't know.

2921
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:57,140
Maybe you can ask for a loan.

2922
02:15:57,140 --> 02:15:59,140
Alright, take care, buddy.

2923
02:15:59,140 --> 02:16:00,640
Bye.

2924
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:04,680
Get a loan out to get some of that DDR crack or something, that's, maybe, maybe if he wins

2925
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:07,680
enough money, he can get a 2DX machine for the house, what do you think?

2926
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,680
Sounds good, huh?

2927
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:11,200
Would you, would you ever bet on a video game real money?

2928
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:17,040
I'm like, I'm, I love gambling, but it ends at like slot machines, nickel size at the

2929
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:18,040
casino.

2930
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:20,320
Rob, I don't play the lottery.

2931
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:21,320
Isn't it, but isn't it fascinating?

2932
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:25,280
The only closest I've ever done to it is a lottery pool at work, where I was only out

2933
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:26,280
$2.

2934
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:29,760
Isn't that fascinating, though, that there's this whole like betting on Madden circuit?

2935
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:31,160
I think it's freaking sad.

2936
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:32,840
It is in a way, but it's, it's...

2937
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:35,160
I don't think gambling is fun.

2938
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:41,400
I don't like to give up money where I know it can go towards something useful.

2939
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:43,320
Like one or two dollars, that's nothing.

2940
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:49,960
I can, I'll every so often do like a dollar card at the gas station, but I wouldn't put

2941
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:53,200
up anything more than $5.

2942
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:57,360
For me, I, I'm willing to raise the stakes a little bit, like $20.

2943
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:59,800
Most I think I've ever gambled in a night, it's like $60.

2944
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:03,560
And I go, well, $60 is what I might spend on a video game or spend, you know, but I

2945
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:04,560
always set a limit.

2946
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:07,120
I don't take my ATM card into those places because it's dangerous.

2947
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:09,900
You go in with a set amount of money and you don't expect to walk out with it.

2948
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:11,400
And then you're okay.

2949
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:14,280
Anyway, not that I should be endorsing gambling.

2950
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:18,640
But once in a while, it's not gonna, it's okay.

2951
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:23,160
You don't, you, people know their tolerance is the best for themselves.

2952
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:27,040
So the Skylines are open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2953
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:30,160
The username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio, while we wait to see if we get any more calls.

2954
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:32,480
Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us otherwise?

2955
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:34,440
I'm still reading more of that wiki.

2956
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:38,000
Actually, there's one thing here that's kind of funny.

2957
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,160
On Machima.com, they have a video for, you know how they have all those meet the, you

2958
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:45,880
know, classes of characters in Team Fortress 2?

2959
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:48,240
Well, they have meet the cow.

2960
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:55,080
I guess it's some cardboard cow or some wood cutout cow that's in Team Fortress 2 and it's

2961
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:56,080
pretty funny.

2962
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:57,080
All right.

2963
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:58,080
We have another call.

2964
02:17:58,080 --> 02:17:59,080
Let's go to the phones.

2965
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:00,080
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

2966
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:01,080
Who is this?

2967
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:04,760
This is the one from Sweden.

2968
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:06,600
Our Swedish friend.

2969
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:09,920
I was hoping you'd call tonight with all the ABBA references we were making earlier in

2970
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:10,920
the show.

2971
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:11,920
No, I'm just, I'm...

2972
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:12,920
What's that?

2973
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:17,280
It wasn't about that, though, but, well, hell.

2974
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,280
That's all right.

2975
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:19,280
I'm just messing with you.

2976
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:20,280
What's on your mind, buddy?

2977
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:26,040
Well, I, well, the system specs for Age of Reckoning.

2978
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:28,880
Warhammer has been, finally been released.

2979
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:33,600
I don't know if you actually did mention it, but, well, it has been released.

2980
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:36,400
Tell us a little bit about it.

2981
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:43,840
The system specs for Warhammer Online has been released, which is a basic single core

2982
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:57,160
Tenseum 4, 2.4, and mostly, like, a gig of RAM, if you run AXP or Vista, and if you're

2983
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:59,640
running Vista, you need two.

2984
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:08,000
Other than that, you need an average modern video card, and that's, you're ready to go.

2985
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,080
That sounds like most anyone can run this, if you have a modern PC.

2986
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:13,080
Yeah.

2987
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:24,760
Since they're aiming for, aiming for, basically, the WoW, the WoW scale of players, even though

2988
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:34,160
I'm quite a bit surprised, since, at least in my case, I'm running really on a, as current

2989
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:44,920
state, unfortunately, a big, low generation 7 Geforce card, and that one isn't supported.

2990
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:56,480
And the funny thing is that mostly low, mostly low ATI cards are supported, but the Nvidia

2991
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:57,960
ones are not.

2992
02:19:57,960 --> 02:20:02,160
Here's the weird thing, you said that this game is out there, it's gonna be a potential

2993
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:06,120
challenger to WoW as a lot of games have been claiming to be lately, but when your specs

2994
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:11,960
are so high, you know, relatively high, I think, you know, the thing about WoW, it runs

2995
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:16,400
on pretty crappy systems, and Max, where you don't even have a whole lot of games, WoW,

2996
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:20,160
Blizzard's always been about having the games on both, so how much of a dent can they really

2997
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:21,160
make?

2998
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:22,160
Nah.

2999
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:25,440
I don't know.

3000
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:29,080
It'll take some people away, you know what, there'll be little bits and pieces that'll

3001
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:30,360
take people away from WoW.

3002
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:40,120
For instance, Dark Soccer and I both agree, the day Star Trek Online comes out, which

3003
02:20:40,120 --> 02:20:44,800
we saw some information about today, and we're watching the trailers, bye bye WoW, for a

3004
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:45,800
little while at least.

3005
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:48,800
But I'm not quitting Ragnarok.

3006
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:50,280
All the cool kids are quitting their games.

3007
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:51,800
I'm sorry, go ahead.

3008
02:20:51,800 --> 02:21:01,680
Pardon me, but I'm not that big a fan of Star Trek Geek, so I can't really say anything.

3009
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:10,520
The only space science fiction MMO I played for a while was EVE Online, which, wow, is

3010
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:15,040
sort of fun, even though, if you really ought to break it down on EVE, just on the EVE

3011
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:21,880
front is Biff Gear's big Excel spreadsheet, so...

3012
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:22,880
Awesome.

3013
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:26,200
Bobby Blackwolf says in chat right now, I want to join Rob's fleet in Star Trek Online.

3014
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:28,000
Dude, I'm gonna have a fleet.

3015
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
That's gonna be great.

3016
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:32,640
Anyway, I want to be Captain Sassy Pants.

3017
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:33,640
Anyway.

3018
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:38,800
It's gonna be awesome.

3019
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,440
Captain Sassy Pants of the U.S.S.O.L.R.

3020
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:43,080
Anyway, I'm sorry, we're getting off track, I know you didn't want to talk about Star

3021
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:44,680
Trek because you're not that big a geek.

3022
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:47,800
But go ahead.

3023
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:48,800
Go ahead.

3024
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:49,800
Finish your thought, because we're gonna get going.

3025
02:21:49,800 --> 02:22:01,380
Other than that, I've been, had the opportunity to try out Age of Conan, and, well, I'm not

3026
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:03,920
that impressed, really.

3027
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:06,560
You didn't cyber with anyone in the game, did you?

3028
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:08,040
No, I didn't.

3029
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:09,040
No, I didn't.

3030
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:10,040
Good.

3031
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:11,040
Good.

3032
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:12,920
It sounds like you didn't think it was too high.

3033
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:14,240
What did you not enjoy about it?

3034
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:16,480
What turned you off?

3035
02:22:16,480 --> 02:22:25,120
It's really the combat system that it's, well, it's, we, ugh.

3036
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:31,360
Or maybe just, I need to learn to play, really, but, well.

3037
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:35,600
The combat system wasn't saved by the fact that you could lob people's heads off?

3038
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:42,480
No, I didn't lob any heads off, I think, no.

3039
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:46,760
But it might be also due to the following fact that I'm running, really, my computer

3040
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:54,560
that I'm running Age of Conan on is really a lowest possible you can run on.

3041
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:58,840
Out of curiosity, just to try and wrap things up, and I gotta wrap up the call, but, you

3042
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:02,000
know, we talk about all these computer parts and high-end stuff.

3043
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:07,040
You live in Sweden, and, you know, not that Sweden's like a third-world country by any

3044
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:08,040
means.

3045
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:11,080
I mean, obviously, it's a big part of, you know, the whole cluster of countries over

3046
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:15,280
there on the other side of the pond, but do you get a lot of the high-end stuff as we

3047
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:16,860
get it here?

3048
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:19,640
Or do you find that you guys lag behind a little bit?

3049
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:22,960
No, we don't lag behind at all.

3050
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:30,240
It's just me that's not, that don't have the possibility to dish out to...

3051
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:35,240
No, I know, we're poor here, too, I'm poor, but, well, I am gonna probably dish out the

3052
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:39,080
money because I did a second job recently, but that's alright.

3053
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:49,400
Yeah, well, if you have the opportunity, you can, it's really easy to dish out a few bucks,

3054
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:55,040
so you can get a respectable gaming system, so it's no problem at all.

3055
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:56,040
Alright.

3056
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:59,200
Well, hey, we gotta let you go, buddy, we're running out of time, but thanks so much for

3057
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,480
your call, as always, and letting us know how the weather is on the other side of the

3058
02:24:01,480 --> 02:24:02,480
pond.

3059
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:03,480
Oh, well.

3060
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:04,480
We appreciate it.

3061
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:05,480
Take care, buddy.

3062
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:06,480
Take care, buddy.

3063
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:09,200
We're gonna go ahead and close up the Skype line and take any of the last minute stories

3064
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:11,800
we have here on Orange Lounge Radio.

3065
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:14,560
We have something else we're trying to get to live tonight, just for the live folks on

3066
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:18,200
AllGames.com, so, anything else you guys have tonight?

3067
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:19,720
I wish I could read German.

3068
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:22,520
Why, is there a good German story in the works?

3069
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:27,680
No, I'm finding out Linux install stuff, but the file I found was in German.

3070
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:30,600
You're gonna become a Linux nerd by next week.

3071
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:34,360
Loki, any other final thought, or, I'm sorry, any last minute stories?

3072
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:40,160
No, but I finally got that Super Mario Kingdom, Mushroom Kingdom Fusion thing to run.

3073
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:43,440
It takes about, like, 15 minutes to load, but it's supposedly worth it.

3074
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:44,440
Jeez, Louise.

3075
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:45,440
All right.

3076
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:48,080
We're gonna do it, we're gonna wrap up the show, we're gonna go around and get everybody's

3077
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:49,080
final thoughts.

3078
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:50,640
So, Loki, we'll start with you, your final thought.

3079
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:52,960
I can't wait to play this game.

3080
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:54,360
DarkSakura, your final thought?

3081
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:59,400
Dude, we are so going to see Journey, Heart, and Cheap Trick.

3082
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:01,600
That's freaking awesome.

3083
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:10,280
And my final thought is, I want to quote a Journey song, but not Don't Stop Believin'.

3084
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:12,600
When the lights go down in the city.

3085
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:14,120
When the lights go down.

3086
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:15,120
All right, that'll work.

3087
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:16,400
All right, have a good one, you guys.

3088
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:19,500
Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Podcasting.

3089
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:22,120
You know what, we wouldn't be here without your guys' support.

3090
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:26,340
Again, all we ask if you like our show, tell a couple friends about the show, leave us

3091
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:29,900
some positive reviews out there on the internet on your favorite podcasting website like iTunes

3092
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:31,240
or Dig or what have you.

3093
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:35,200
Help us spread the word because we're pretty stretched for resources here at Orange Launch

3094
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:36,200
Radio.

3095
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:38,160
Sadly, there will be no live show next week.

3096
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:40,080
We're hoping to have something taped for you guys.

3097
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:44,360
Stay tuned to OrangeLaunchRadio.com for the details and don't worry, if you're saddened

3098
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:49,200
by the lack of shows here in August, PAX is going to more than make up for it because

3099
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:54,600
we will be bringing you something not only every day ourselves, but we'll be bringing

3100
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:56,640
you something with AllGames.com.

3101
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:59,920
It is going to be just information freaking overload.

3102
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:03,560
It's later this month, Labor Day weekend here on Orange Launch Radio.

3103
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:05,680
Yay!

3104
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:06,680
Have a good one, everybody.

3105
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:08,480
We'll see you next time here on Orange Launch Radio.

3106
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:12,200
