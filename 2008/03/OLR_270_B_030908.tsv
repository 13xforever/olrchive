23607	29911	Other than Steam, you can now buy the, or soon, you will be able to buy the components of the Orange Box separately.
30592	33193	They'll be hitting retail stores on April 9th.
33894	38437	You'll be able to buy Portal for $19.99 and then, of course, Half-Life 2 Episode 1 and 2 for $29.99 and Team Fortress 2 for $29.99.
38477	40538	All sold separately now.
40558	41119	So, awesome.
41139	42700	I don't know.
52725	54987	Half-Life 2, I don't think, was that expensive to begin with.
55287	56748	I mean, you might as well just buy them all.
57349	67256	I think this is a really good way for people who haven't seen Portal yet to get it, because I know people that would consider that $60 for Portal was a decent buy, and you got all these other cool games free.
67657	75423	So, honestly, this is an excellent... I mean, not to knock the other games, because the Orange Box is a great combo package, but certainly there's a lot of people that want to see Portal by itself.
75503	81988	I guess if you've owned... if you already owned, like, Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, although if you buy the Episode Pack, you're getting one all over again, so...
82975	83776	I don't know.
84056	85036	Oh, go ahead.
85096	88018	That whole bunch of Half-Life is just epic.
89099	89819	It is very epic.
90680	97944	I never realized you were quite the Half-Life fan, DarkSakura, but during our bonus segment tonight, which only the live listeners heard, you're quite a Half-Life fan.
97964	98525	I didn't realize.
98885	103588	Well, keep in mind, I can't really play them because I get bad motion sickness when I play them.
103668	105389	That doesn't mean you don't recognize a good game when you see one.
105569	106029	Well, right.
106209	108591	And I love the story for Half-Life, too.
108611	110372	I mean, Half-Life was sort of like...
111352	113913	Oh, you crawl through some pipes and you kill some aliens.
114374	119436	But I thought that Half-Life 2 had a very, actually a really involved story.
119476	120477	I thought it was very good.
121637	122218	It is very rad.
122258	128361	I was basically loading up everything on my iPhone and listening to it on YouTube at my desk at work.
128881	132383	Ross Steel UT has some advice, and I'm kind of curious if it actually would work or not.
132503	133764	He says play on a smaller screen.
133944	134384	Would that help?
134444	134524	No.
135188	135308	No?
135488	135948	That's too bad.
136068	139529	It actually has gotten a little bit better since we started playing on the widescreen.
139889	140109	Huh.
140169	146091	Because I have a 50-inch widescreen TV, and it was a lot worse on our old CRT, which was smaller.
146691	147051	Weird.
147151	149712	I kind of get the logic behind what he's suggesting, though.
149732	151352	It's kind of weird that it's the reverse.
151392	153132	The flatter the screen, the less sick I get.
154013	154553	Huh.
155113	160354	But I also get less eye strain on my old Trinitron versus my old CRT screen.
160394	161354	Yeah, the eye strain might be...
164318	164739	Interesting.
164879	167764	But it still is bad, no matter what, it still is bad.
167824	170809	However, nothing makes me as freaking motion sick as GoldenEye64 did.
171911	172212	All right.
173203	174384	Well, anyhow, moving on.
174424	180789	Speaking of splitting up, Ziff Davis Media owns a lot of stuff, and after this, they might have to split some of it off.
181209	182090	No, I'm just kidding.
182150	190676	I'm not here yelling doom and gloom, but certainly that's what a lot of people are speculating after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week.
190716	191017	That's right.
191077	193499	Ziff Davis filed for bankruptcy earlier this week.
194179	197822	They had $390 million in debt since last August.
198963	201805	Now, if this bankruptcy is actually approved by the bankruptcy courts...
202265	202585	and so on.
223189	226711	They are saying that all the video game stuff, it should be business as usual.
227932	239899	Jason Young, who is the CEO of Ziff Davis, has this quote, quote, Today's restructuring agreement goes a long way towards resolving the burdens of a debt load and capital structure established seven years ago during a leveraged buyout of the company.
240199	241400	So that's Chapter 11, right?
241720	241900	Yeah.
242401	243601	Yeah.
245983	252267	Basically, Chapter 11 is just strictly for businesses only, because we actually, at my work, we occasionally get a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in for...
253188	255830	for multifamily homes, basically apartments, condos, that type of thing.
257392	262596	And this is basically done for the purpose of paying back and restructuring their debt.
263256	265558	It's to give the company a chance to make a fresh start.
266859	267160	All right.
267460	268621	Well, we'll see what happens.
270002	273765	And of course, people are screaming doom and gloom, and our chat room is no different.
273825	276247	PKJr92 says, does this mean 1UP will die?
277268	277568	No.
277648	278009	Doubt it.
278249	279930	I mean, it's one of their more successful properties, right?
281621	282441	Kill something.
283002	287364	Well, the bad thing about Chapter 11 is that it's actually really bad for their stockholders.
288064	288344	Gotcha.
288384	295987	Because if their debts exceed their assets, then when the bankruptcy is done, all of their rights and interests are terminated.
297028	302070	Basically, all the creditors have a new business to start with, nothing on the books.
302710	306092	SSJ100 Matt says, if Davis going bankrupt could mean the end of digital life.
307472	311194	I don't know about that because they were a major sponsor, but I don't know.
313527	313907	We'll see.
315448	318189	I guess that's too bad, though, for them, I guess.
319050	319290	Yep.
320210	321411	Sucks to be stockholders first.
321431	325493	Business sucks sometimes, so hopefully this will be a nice fresh start for them.
326073	330975	That's why you can usually tell if there's rumors going out about a company going under when people start selling off their stock.
331535	331796	True.
334197	334437	Anyway.
334457	334917	That's all I got.
335709	338811	Well, how about something that's just a little bit happier, huh?
339191	339471	Sure.
339891	340892	Midway!
341432	342533	We like Midway.
342893	345474	Except Midway's been losing some money, too.
347495	353979	Well, more around the amount of $97.4 million last financial year.
354519	362323	So they're trying to cater more towards the casual gamer by having an online portal for
363339	365040	and a lot of those games that are out.
365120	369424	I mean, basically, it's just... Well, I just completely lost my train of thought.
370345	370965	That's okay.
371205	374348	Midway owns the rights to a lot of classic franchises though, right?
375148	375889	Yeah.
376149	380593	I mean, Midway... It was... Wasn't it Midway that brought us out like Mortal Kombat?
380833	381053	Yeah.
381293	388959	Well, I mean, I'm going even further back than that because I'm thinking about those like classic packs with like Robotron and Joust and you know, all that.
389399	391021	They've rehashed that stuff a thousand times.
391061	392502	I wonder if this is kind of a part of
393001	395463	How they're going to launch a more casual games portal.
395823	404869	Or, because, you know, I can think of casual games as old school games that were very simple, or I can think of them as, you know, pop cap type casual games, like Bejeweled and stuff.
405630	407911	That, again, you know, very easy to pick up and play type games.
407931	413275	I would go in probably with the older games, and say like the re-release that shit over and over and over and over and over again.
414156	420060	Well, basically, they're only saying that two titles have been out that's used any of the different type of...
421207	421708	and DarkSakura.com.
445906	446206	Who knows?
446486	464401	I heart classic games though and if the portal is built good where it does online high score boards and maybe some achievement point type thing and some clever new little innovative things that make it stand out, I would probably check it out.
464922	471928	So I guess we're coming up on the 10th anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast and
472455	479198	To commemorate that, Sega of Japan has updated their Dreamcast.com website with a question.
479739	481399	Do you still own a Dreamcast?
482180	482400	Yes.
482820	496527	If you do, what you can do is submit your serial number, and they will basically register an account with you with user.dreamcast.com, and you'll get an email, which is your serial number at dreamcast.com.
498541	499962	What the hell is that going to do for me?
507436	508797	I could register both of mine.
508817	510458	There's hardcore Sega people out there.
510538	512519	Hard fucking core Sega people out there.
512880	514841	Jamie's kind of borderline one of them, I think.
514981	516122	I have two Dreamcasts.
516182	520064	Maybe I should register mine so I can have another spam email address.
520324	520704	Why not?
520784	521265	It would be fun.
521565	522105	That's weird, though.
522125	523346	You just have your serial number.
523646	529410	I mean, it almost makes me wonder, like, wow, could they release an email program for the Dreamcast or something really weird all these years later?
529830	532031	But yeah, the Dreamcast came out, what, 9-9-99?
532051	533592	But I imagine it was a little bit before that in Japan.
533652	534393	We're bringing it back.
534853	539177	I think that I got my other one in, I want to say April?
540058	541599	Yeah, it was probably a few months earlier in Japan.
541639	543441	Yeah, because I had my Dreamcast way early.
544402	545082	Why couldn't they?
545182	546844	I mean, that would be kind of cool to bring it back.
546884	551948	Just like, you know, make it all open source type stuff.
551988	552489	You know what I mean?
552989	557053	I mean, they already have a pretty big open source community for homebrew stuff, but...
557765	562389	Just, you know, a lot of these portable game systems, even like the DS and stuff, aren't that powerful.
562449	568635	I mean, you could probably do a lot on the Dreamcast that you could do on those systems, so... Why not?
570257	572959	Well, we'll see what happens, see what this develops into.
572979	575641	I hope we haven't heard the last of the Dreamcast.
575702	581447	Even if it's something, I mean, obviously we don't expect a lot, but even something little, I think them putting out some type of, like...
582048	582648	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
605387	609609	Well, technology has come a long way since the days of the Dreamcast.
609669	612730	You know, now we have the Xbox 360, which are on live and all that stuff.
612810	619232	And once you know it, it didn't take too long before we have yet another story coming from a CBS news station.
619653	627996	WCBS-TV in New York is reporting, and this is the headline, alarming trend, online video game predators.
630120	631201	The Predator's Story
650822	651242	Interesting.
651262	663050	Well, here's what happened is that, according to the story, apparently things were going fine, and then this guy crashed into somebody, and the webcam picture came back, and it was a butt.
664812	667233	Somebody put their butt on the webcam.
667273	676039	But it actually, I don't know, it gets a little sick, because Najee's father, whose name is Charles Johnson, said that the image showed a lot more than just a butt.
676379	680042	It was a picture of the guy mooning the camera, and you could actually see his genitals.
681223	681744	Gross!
682484	683785	Why would you send that picture over?
683806	691513	That takes talent, too, because the camera takes the picture pretty quick, so you'd have to crash your car in, like, I don't know.
691573	694676	Or you'd have to have your friend standing there, waiting to go.
695677	696298	Oh, there you go, yeah.
697173	698215	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
712333	716976	And as sensationalist as the story is, it does make some decent points.
717837	724981	The father said that he thought it would be fine to play because the game is rated E for everyone, or E10+, or whatever.
725301	727423	However, of course, the ESRB does have that warning.
727543	729944	It's in the beginning of the fucking game.
730425	733106	For a second there, and you have to hit a button to go past it.
733306	733527	Right.
733967	735868	But at the same time, I understand that, but at the same time,
738049	739912	Come on, what fucking moron did this?
740332	749004	I mean, to show your butt to your friends is one thing, but to show it to complete strangers when it might be 12-year-old kids playing the game, it's kind of messed up.
750249	755811	and causes things like this to happen where now the media runs with it and talks about sexual predators.
756711	758052	They were probably high.
758172	759592	I don't think they're sexual predators.
759632	761153	They're probably drug users.
761613	762573	Not that that makes it right.
762593	764374	It's because media has nothing to talk about.
764554	765794	I'll give you a perfect example.
765834	772916	We were watching the local news yesterday and they were talking about a fire that happened in North Carolina.
773196	774737	We live in California.
775357	780799	I mean, how fucking slow is the news if you're talking about a building fire in another state?
782399	786421	Oh, and then they proceed to show a, what was it, a chicken sledding.
786821	789002	And that's how slow the news was.
789102	793063	That's why they run with this crap, because they can spin it, and it's an interesting story.
793103	798665	It'll put some, not really put asses in seats, but you know what I mean, tunes people in.
799685	803767	Rob with two Bs pours a little salt in the wound, says California has enough of its own fires.
804127	804227	Oh.
805444	806324	Not right now, they don't.
806525	807985	They're in between Fire Seas.
808826	813468	Pendro in chat says this, you should be able to rate people as you play them, like feedback on eBay or something.
813488	815789	And of course, the 360 has a system kind of like that.
816109	817029	But what about PS3?
817670	818150	I'm not sure.
818170	819911	I don't know, maybe.
823492	827294	I think there needs to be a way where something can be done a little more immediately.
827614	831536	I mean, I know on Xbox 360, they swear up and down, they do review that stuff.
831886	832187	I don't know.
832207	833791	I don't know if you have to pay people.
840808	843210	My God, dude, it's a person's ass.
843250	845552	It's not like you're scarred for fucking life.
845892	847993	Well, but I kind of see it.
848013	849254	That is kind of nasty.
849294	855639	Like, if you're a 12-year-old kid, because they're saying it's not just his butt, but I guess the whole naughty bits were dangling there, too.
855799	856460	So, you know.
856480	857460	Okay, okay.
857600	858961	Yeah, I'm so sorry.
858981	863084	Yeah, tomorrow they're going to go out and murder people because they've been severely scarred.
863425	863805	That's right.
863825	868969	You better watch your kids now because now they're going to go on a murderous rage and go and rape and pillage and fucking...
869569	871911	The world is over for you and your family.
872291	875072	Might as well, you know, leave the country.
875132	879655	That's all.
879715	882997	He also says you're overreacting.
884858	886439	DarkSakura, you're awfully quiet.
886479	887319	What are your thoughts on this?
888340	891702	It's a butt, and it's, you know, dingley bits, I guess.
893590	900155	So you're saying, you know what, maybe we should just stop being so freaking sensitive to... I really think that's it.
900175	904238	If people didn't make a big deal out of this crap, then it wouldn't, you know, be such an issue.
905279	905579	All right.
905879	909582	Well, if you have some feedback, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.
909602	918669	But regardless, you know what, thinking about that this guy was so stupid to do this to strangers kind of pisses me off and makes me a little bit angsty that this guy was such a moron.
919309	921231	So it's time to have the FUs of the week.
936977	941940	Um, I have a few FUs to compile.
941960	948925	Um, my first one goes, of course, to Daylight Savings Time, because I went to bed at 4.30am, and of course woke up at 1.30am.
948945	948985	Um...
951957	959319	My next one goes towards the guy who was driving the red pickup truck, which, by the way, was a Ford, and Ford stands for Fix Off and Repair Daily.
959799	970362	Anyway, I was in the left lane, and he was in the right lane, and then he just cut out in front of me, like, literally, with inches to spare, to get into the turning lane on the left side of me.
970722	973082	And I was like, dude, where'd you learn how to drive?
973282	976763	You know, oh, I'm sorry, you did learn how to drive, if you're driving like that.
977423	979064	I hate stupid people who drive.
979564	979644	Um...
980658	990081	and also another F you goes to my cat for throwing up in an inappropriate place.
991381	991942	Sorry to hear it.
992082	994162	Although she's a cute baby and I forgive her.
994923	995243	Loki!
996183	1008407	F you to this guy named Michael T something or I don't remember his last name but apparently I knew enough because we sat there at dinner on Saturday no, Friday, I'm sorry
1009191	1014557	and this guy went on and on and on and on about his fucking life next to us.
1014717	1017680	Apparently this couple was on their first date or whatever.
1017920	1020623	I feel sorry for the woman because this guy just went on and on.
1021083	1025788	Yeah, one time I had a felony, but they cleared it, so it's all good now.
1025868	1031494	And, you know, I took in my truck because I'm a... What was it?
1031534	1032855	He was a plumbing inspector.
1033582	1062815	and I took in my truck one time and they gave me a loaner car and it was an undercover cop car and so I drove through the ghetto and everyone was like oh my god it's the cops went on and on for two hours and he was still talking the entire time I don't think the woman got a word in so sucks for don't meet people on MySpace this is what happens alright my FUs of the week go to also Daylight Savings Time I think it's horrible and you know losing sleep sucks I hate that
1063659	1066820	and, um, gosh, I can't really think of a lot else.
1067341	1069802	I think just Daylight Saving Time makes up the bulk of my FUs this week.
1070002	1071282	I think it's unnecessary.
1071582	1072723	It is a necessary FU.
1073583	1075864	Because when you lose sleep, there's never a good thing to come out of that.
1076104	1078145	So, there you have it.
1079825	1080626	Our FUs of the week.
1082186	1083607	I do want to point this out real quick.
1083787	1088449	Toshin is in our JustinTV chat and says that the whole Dreamcast thing
1088960	1095162	It says this is a scam, and gives me a link to the NeoGAF forums that isn't loading for me right now.
1095202	1101143	I'm timing out, so I can't read you the full text of what it says, but apparently that Dreamcast thing may not be legitimate.
1101744	1102204	Eh, who cares?
1102384	1102964	I don't really care.
1104064	1104804	It's a fucking Dreamcast.
1104824	1106285	What are they going to do with my serial number?
1107105	1107845	I guess that's true.
1107885	1109046	What can they do with the serial number?
1109666	1110786	Besides maybe send spam.
1110806	1111866	Do you have to give me your email address?
1113107	1113487	I don't know.
1113627	1117908	I haven't signed up the site's down, so... Oh, maybe it got taken down for being a big scam!
1118417	1120279	No, there's an error thing.
1120319	1122621	I think it's just too many people trying to access it at one time.
1125144	1125464	All right.
1128267	1131930	Well, let's go ahead and get back into some gaming news.
1132731	1135514	Oh, actually, no, we're going to go and actually check out the mailbag.
1136343	1137043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1165799	1169942	But regardless, we are going to open up the mailbag because we did get at least a couple emails, right?
1170523	1170943	A couple.
1171103	1173685	And that's enough for us to open up the mailbag and jump on in.
1173725	1175406	So fill up the mailbag.
1175446	1177028	Give Jamie a lot of work to do next week.
1177088	1178729	Mailbag at OrangeLingerie.com.
1178769	1179209	Here we go.
1186075	1193620	The first email of the week is actually from Cheeseburger asking us to play the intro to Castlevania 64.
1193680	1193740	No.
1197922	1199843	Make me play the intro from a good game and we'll do it.
1200323	1200843	Ha ha.
1201863	1203744	Well, he actually emailed us.
1204404	1205204	Actually, no, I take that back.
1205224	1206925	That wasn't from Cheeseburger.
1206965	1210946	It was from... God, now I have to go in that folder to find out who it was.
1211526	1214627	Because he emailed something else, but I can't read half of it on the air.
1215807	1216207	Gotcha.
1216547	1220848	Because it involves finding a broken DS and using their serial number to replace it.
1221049	1222529	And we're not going to do that.
1222749	1224249	Oh, snap.
1224469	1225710	We're not going to do that.
1225810	1226290	I'm sorry.
1227228	1229789	Not after the debates we've been in the past couple weeks.
1229829	1231390	I think maybe that email's best unread.
1232191	1236953	But also he's saying something about, do Koopa and Purin exist in Super Smash Bros.
1236973	1237193	Melee?
1237213	1238174	I think he means Brawl.
1239555	1250780	Basically, he was saying that if you change the language, Bowser becomes Koopa and Jigglypuff becomes Purin, which was their original names, and then you can save them that way?
1252661	1255463	I don't know what you mean, so sorry.
1256735	1257896	That's the only other email.
1258776	1264440	And by the way, that one that I lost was from somebody named Jake.
1266001	1266862	You lost an email?
1267783	1270344	No, it's, he didn't put a signature on there.
1270364	1274507	The one that I mistakenly gave to Cheeseburger.
1275168	1275308	Oh.
1276969	1277209	So.
1277970	1278350	That's it?
1278370	1279831	We didn't get any like real email.
1280752	1281032	Weak.
1281616	1285079	Except for some spam that I'm deleting right now that's titled LOL.
1288242	1289022	And Rob did it.
1290924	1291344	What's that?
1292385	1293646	It's titled LOL and you laughed.
1293826	1294167	LOL.
1294367	1294687	LOL.
1294887	1295187	I did.
1295348	1296288	LOL.
1296468	1296849	Lost.
1298170	1299071	Weak mailbag.
1299111	1300232	I'm disappointed in all of you.
1300272	1305376	But then again, I blame not having a part B last week where we actually had a mailbag to remind you that you can send us emails.
1305416	1306877	So send us emails.
1306897	1307898	Mailbag at originalsradio.com.
1308871	1310012	Are you a hardcore gamer?
1310212	1310532	Yes!
1311152	1313174	Have you downloaded the hardcore gamer pack yet?
1313334	1313654	No!
1314034	1315835	Well then you're not really a hardcore gamer.
1316215	1317536	Oh my god, how dare you!
1317696	1318197	Exactly.
1318777	1332105	On Xbox Live Marketplace, there is a brand new hardcore gamer picture pack featuring such wonderful pictures as Proud to be a Noob, Camper, Respawn, a little target symbol, and Teabag.
1332265	1333506	Yes, Teabagged.
1334827	1335147	Why?
1335167	1335227	Why?
1335809	1338190	If you really want to buy this, it's only $1.25.
1339971	1345673	And yes, all people know that you're truly hardcore if you buy this and display them proudly.
1346153	1351316	Or I would like to point out that for free, you can download community gamer picks.
1351656	1354417	And we're in pack number two of the community gamer picks.
1354777	1356818	And there's a little pick that says OLR.
1357178	1361860	And if you put that on your gamer tag, at least we'll know you're hardcore, as will all the rest of the OLR army.
1362260	1364081	So don't download this crap.
1364827	1365467	Don't pay for this.
1365707	1367528	Yeah, these look really stupid.
1368629	1370490	SSJ100Matt sums up my thoughts exactly.
1370570	1373211	Why do they need to endorse stupidity that is teabagging?
1373511	1373832	I don't know.
1373872	1376233	Maybe we should ask disruptive media publishers.
1376813	1377533	I think we should.
1378174	1379134	Do we have a telephone number?
1379394	1380155	Let's call them right now.
1380215	1380815	I'm sure they're there.
1381555	1381896	I don't know.
1381956	1382796	Let me get on that.
1384137	1385577	We'll send them an email maybe this week.
1386118	1386498	We'll see.
1388823	1391785	Are you going to download the hardcore gamer picks, Loki?
1392946	1394147	No, I'm doing it right now.
1394407	1394847	Oh, wow.
1395147	1395608	Oh, wow.
1397589	1403072	Well, what's pretty hardcore as well is proposing to your significant other over a video game.
1403433	1404914	But do you know what's really hardcore?
1404954	1406395	I remember last year we had this story.
1406415	1407876	I think we had a Viva Pinata story.
1408196	1409997	We had an Animal Crossing story, I want to say.
1410457	1412699	And this time, this is kind of interesting.
1414280	1417462	He actually made a homebrew version of...
1418376	1421628	of his significant other's favorite game, which was Bejeweled.
1422375	1424476	He made a homebrew version of this on the DS.
1424897	1427378	And this guy, Bernie, he's actually a user on Zanga.
1427919	1434203	What he did, he spent a few weeks actually making this Nintendo DS version of Bejeweled completely from the ground up.
1434683	1439126	And what happens is that once the game gets to a certain score, the screen clears.
1439587	1443769	And then what would happen is that a ring of the jewels comes up on the screen.
1444190	1452155	And what he did is that when his girlfriend was playing the game and then got on the special screen, Bernie actually had a real ring there and proposed.
1453356	1471467	everybody aww sorry hairball but no that's definitely dedication to build a game to propose to your significant other with that's pretty hardcore so
1472597	1473077	Good for you.
1474517	1494122	I was just going to say, if you would like to email Disruptive Media Publishers and tell them how crappy those hardcore gamer pics are, you can email them at info at DisruptivePublishers.com I also have a mailing address on DisruptivePublishers.com Check it out.
1494162	1494943	They're in Washington.
1495063	1496103	Bellingham, Washington.
1496643	1500784	Ossifer in chat suggests teabag your girlfriend for instant marriage.
1501940	1503701	They also have a Facebook community, too.
1503761	1504762	Let her know you're hardcore.
1504782	1506243	That's all the cool kids are on Facebook now.
1506263	1506803	Teabagger.
1509725	1510605	Right, DarkSakura?
1510885	1513567	If Dan teabagged you in Halo, that's love, right?
1516569	1517630	My silence is my answer.
1517670	1518650	I'm getting blinked at.
1519591	1520771	Perhaps we should move on, then.
1521892	1528176	Well, for anyone who's a fan of Undertow, there is an expansion out that it costs...
1528803	1530324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1551119	1559701	Um, it's five levels, you have a new alien race called The Elect, wow, and four multiplayer maps, so there's no other details than that.
1560141	1561541	And yeah, it's been fixed.
1564122	1564322	Huh.
1564782	1574144	Well, it was free for, I mean, the game was free for a while, you know, to make up for Xbox Live outages, although I'm not sure if that's really more of a punishment for us or for, you know,
1575111	1575511	Thank you.
1576492	1581814	I can't say I was an Undertow fan, but, you know, it's hard to bitch when something's free.
1582034	1583235	It's really hard to complain.
1583655	1590278	But then again, I think about Totem Ball and Yaris, and there's been some real shit free games on Xbox Live.
1590679	1592900	But then, like, Agent's Wing wasn't bad.
1593780	1596461	It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.
1596541	1597382	It was no Yaris.
1597442	1597742	Come on.
1598082	1600163	Yeah, so, I don't know.
1600643	1601904	Yaris is unforgivable.
1602024	1603905	I will never buy a Yaris because of that.
1605302	1606443	and yeah, they suck.
1607804	1619571	So there is a rumor that there's going to be a price cut coming for European Xbox 360s and apparently the price cut is supposed to happen on March 14th.
1619691	1625694	It's going to be a price cut of 50 euros and I guess we'll see if this actually happens.
1625814	1632458	It's being reported by TechRadar and apparently they got the news of a new SKU
1634805	1639409	Numerous well-placed game industry sources, they said, have confirmed it.
1640230	1654521	And that would bring the price, I guess, of the 360 to 250 euros for the arcade pack, and around 150 euros for the 360, and then the arcade would be 197 euros.
1654541	1655502	So, I don't know.
1659645	1662067	Hopefully that happens, but I guess we'll find out soon if that's the case.
1662682	1664122	Well, price cuts aren't a bad thing.
1664762	1668443	I mean, I cannot think of a story where we've talked about a price cut and it was a bad thing.
1669503	1672384	So... I'm thinking.
1672944	1676245	I know Loki, the devil's advocate here on the program, trying to think of something.
1676805	1677925	I'm sure there's the chat as well.
1677965	1680065	Well, you think about that while I report on this.
1681065	1682326	Other worldly news.
1682806	1686587	Asia is finally going to be getting Guitar Hero.
1687067	1688327	And what's kind of interesting...
1689700	1695064	Blizzard is actually going to be helping the game actually come to Asia, because you know how Activision just recently combined with Blizzard?
1695664	1703209	Well, Blizzard has the institutional expertise to bring Guitar Hero to places like China and Korea.
1703629	1706411	And if you kind of think about it, Blizzard did launch World of Warcraft.
1706431	1707412	I know how they're doing it.
1707712	1707912	How?
1708212	1713195	They're going to have it where if you play the game well enough, you gain experience in World of Warcraft on your account.
1713496	1713996	Who knows?
1714456	1714836	Who knows?
1714856	1715397	Yeah.
1716508	1745841	apparently the Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has also said this he's brought up the possibility of maybe putting other instruments in Guitar Hero which would be no surprise if you remember our story on DJ Heroes I've got a totally great idea this has never been attempted ever before we're gonna put singing and drums in the game and guess what we also may put keyboards never been done before in the face of the earth we are the first and then we're gonna have a turntable and five to seven keys they need a zither hero
1747338	1748238	I still want Sitar Hero.
1748278	1751280	Where are our awards for originality and innovation?
1751420	1753140	Give me Didgeridoo Hero.
1753361	1754121	That's original.
1761704	1762945	Didgeridoo Hero would rock.
1763405	1763845	And you know it.
1766566	1766906	Anyway.
1767707	1768387	Clarinet Hero.
1770390	1775812	to continue on though with Guitar Hero information for Guitar Hero 3 in time for St.
1775852	1799300	Patrick's Day there is going to be a pack with stuff by Dropkick Murphys which is pretty cool there will be Famous for Nothing Flanagan's Ball and Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya so that's pretty cool and also right now there's a Modern Metal pack out though that has some cool stuff on it too how very holiday appropriate
1800356	1804580	That's an interesting... I like Dropkick Murphys, but I like Flogging Molly better.
1805701	1806522	And I would have gone with them.
1807723	1814911	So I was on YouTube looking for didgeridoo clips so I could, you know, hypothesize what didgeridoo hero might sound like.
1815291	1819095	Keep in mind, I've never heard this, but this says didgeridoo techno.
1820116	1820957	This could be horrible.
1823075	1823795	That's pretty sweet.
1823815	1824695	That's actually pretty fucking rad.
1824715	1825315	That is really cool.
1825355	1828356	Oh my god, this aboriginal guy on the streets, he actually, this is live.
1828376	1830997	He actually has a little techno thing and he's playing the tree doodles.
1831017	1831297	I'd buy that.
1831317	1832337	I would buy that in a heartbeat.
1851074	1855575	That's fucking sweet.
1855655	1856496	So hardcore.
1856536	1857356	That's awesome.
1857596	1858296	I like that song.
1858396	1859577	I am going to link that YouTube.
1859917	1860417	Search for it.
1860457	1862277	It's Didgeridoo Techno on YouTube.
1862317	1863158	That's pretty sweet.
1863198	1870160	If you know how to spell Didgeridoo, D-I-D-G-E-R-I-D-O-O I'm going to put that in my favorites on YouTube.
1870220	1871420	I think that was pretty rad.
1871900	1873921	I'll actually put that in the OLR favorites right now.
1874841	1875381	Check that out.
1876042	1877062	That's pretty awesome.
1880356	1882877	Alright, sorry, we can go back to real gaming news now.
1882917	1884658	I'll stop the didgeridoo.
1885098	1887719	I'm telling you, man, this guy needs to put out a fucking album.
1887799	1890220	Seriously, we need to get him on the show.
1891221	1896423	I want a new, I mean, with all due respect to Middy Head and the great OLR theme he made us, he's an awesome guy.
1896783	1902326	I do think it's time to maybe get a fresh Orange Lounge Radio theme in here and I demand didgeridoo in the theme.
1902846	1903466	And auto-harp.
1905367	1906428	Somebody needs to make that happen.
1907308	1908829	That is fucking awesome.
1909029	1909269	Alright.
1910794	1914796	Orange Lounge Radio, with Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.
1930492	1930892	PS3, SingStar Volume 2
1957438	1960161	So Australia may see another SingStar game.
1960481	1963664	Although we over here in the United States are still waiting for the first SingStar game.
1964084	1966426	We actually have a clip of one of the new songs from SingStar.
1966827	1968408	Okay, I promise that's the last time.
1968488	1968609	Um...
1979904	1981585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2010544	2012405	Oh, snap, because, you know, have you heard that?
2012425	2016667	That the ESRB, actually, the publishers send information to the ESRB.
2016707	2017848	They don't always play the games.
2018488	2020329	It's kind of, I swear that's how it works.
2020349	2020829	It's very interesting.
2020849	2022310	Well, I know they can't play it all the way through.
2022450	2031295	Usually they get a clip or a video of, like, gameplay footage that's, you know, supposed to be the most violent or, you know, obscene stuff in the game.
2031455	2031675	Uh-huh.
2032349	2034050	And then they'd make their ratings based on that.
2034511	2038413	Which is why things like Hot Coffee were so controversial, because that was omitted.
2038633	2041135	But, I mean, we're not going to go over that whole thing again.
2041495	2042676	But anyhow, here's the other big thing.
2043437	2050682	The guy also says that sequels are not judged on their own merits, but rather the merits of the games before it.
2051485	2053246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2076869	2080631	That's going to be a huge kick in the face if a lot of this is true.
2080651	2083812	Well, they've already come out and said, oh, well, blah, blah, blah.
2083832	2086254	We don't support his views and all that stuff.
2086294	2087814	We're the ECB.
2087854	2088415	We're awesome.
2088455	2089175	That kind of thing.
2089415	2091456	Those sound like fair requests to me, though.
2091516	2094037	I don't know if it's just me, but it sounds very fair to me.
2094097	2096218	What do you think about those revelations, DarkSakura?
2096238	2097619	I mean, is this going to— I'm not at all surprised.
2098299	2099720	Yeah, but, I mean—
2101103	2107866	We kind of rely on the ESRB as gamers when these games come out and all these horrible things happen.
2107886	2109947	Take the butt story from Burnout earlier.
2109967	2113048	We go, well, the ESRB did say the rating is subject to change.
2113308	2117770	But if the ESRB gets discredited with stuff like this, this really screws us in a way.
2118570	2118850	I don't know.
2119391	2119891	It's kind of sad.
2121492	2125713	I honestly think it's sort of a corrupt institution anyway.
2125773	2129015	RawSteelUT has said that Patricia Vance has already come out and denied it.
2129615	2129755	Well...
2130168	2131909	That seems like a given, though.
2133189	2135690	Obviously, take it as a rumor for now, but it certainly is a question.
2136850	2144092	I have heard from inside folks, and I'm pretty sure it's out there on the internet also, that ESRB doesn't necessarily play through the games.
2144492	2147793	They will rate based on stuff that you send them.
2148334	2149014	Kind of interesting.
2149354	2154215	And I remember overhearing at a trade show once about people, and I think you were there too, Loki.
2154235	2159397	I don't know if you ever heard this same conversation, but about how a particular game I'm thinking of, a particular game
2160012	2163315	I don't even want to say because I don't want people to speculate.
2163335	2174363	But a particular game, I heard the developer joking with another really big industry press person about how they got this through the ESRB with a particular rating.
2175344	2176985	I just was kind of shocked to hear that kind of talk.
2177766	2178146	Interesting.
2185512	2188394	Just to move away from the ESRB and how crappy they are.
2188634	2188894	Let's.
2189255	2189675	Yes, please.
2190565	2193087	Skype is actually coming out on Japanese PSPs this month.
2193947	2194228	Woohoo!
2194748	2202073	So it will be on March 18th, and it's only, of course, for the Slim PSP, the newer one.
2203174	2205575	And it's supposed to be a month later over here in the U.S.
2206916	2213921	Also, the microphone attachment is going to be 2,500 yen, or two for 4,000.
2214001	2214101	Hmm.
2214141	2217863	So that's not bad.
2218564	2219084	Not bad at all.
2219787	2222528	I'm glad that Japanese PSP users will get to use this.
2223509	2223889	Good call.
2224429	2225870	And then we'll be able to do it a month later.
2227550	2228111	We already have it.
2228131	2232313	We got our first call last week on the Skype line from a Skype PSP user.
2236074	2245458	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is going to be due out here next month and they have released the full list of cars and tracks that are going to be included in that.
2247279	2248920	Tons of different stuff you can pick from.
2248960	2249360	I believe
2249941	2268887	Was it, I want to say like 65 cars and 6 tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit, the Eiger Nordwand, Fuji Speedway, London City Track, Daytona International Speedway, and the High Speed Ring.
2269887	2273788	And a bunch of different cars, I don't even know what to even cover on that, but
2274591	2278193	Lots of stuff to keep you satisfied until the full game comes out.
2278614	2286799	Also, it's going to have a brand new drift mode for the US version, as well as the ability to fine-tune your car, and two-player split-screen racing.
2287740	2288880	And, I guess, a new set of events.
2290902	2291562	Not bad for $40.
2295625	2298827	So that's not just Prologue, that's the full game, right?
2298927	2299607	No, that's Prologue.
2300288	2301208	Oh, that's just Prologue.
2301388	2301609	Yeah.
2301889	2302129	Oh, okay.
2302149	2302249	Okay.
2302588	2303628	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2333072	2333973	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2360925	2362246	Although my dentist is pretty cool.
2362466	2366528	Do you know how much money I would pay for a YouTube of Loki playing All-Star Cheer Squad?
2367148	2368389	There's no money in the world.
2370030	2371410	Maybe that'll be the next bet.
2371851	2378554	Whenever we find another bet for Loki to take on, we'll get him to play All-Star Cheer Squad in the Tingle outfit.
2382256	2384257	We need to make this happen somehow.
2384895	2388577	We will be opening the Skype line after this next story.
2388597	2392379	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
2393340	2395681	Go ahead and give us a call after this story.
2397062	2412131	Well, for people who were fans of the Castlevania series and collect action figures, it doesn't look like we're going to really be getting the new figures that they were discussing.
2412471	2412551	Um,
2414143	2430530	I mean, basically, they were saying, they were asked if there were going to be any more in that Castlevania line and it was reported that there were no plans at all and no news on Castlevania figures and that they will not be revisiting the license.
2432911	2433792	Well, that's kind of a bummer.
2434512	2435973	I want a Richter figure, dang it.
2436253	2436673	Richter.
2436693	2439514	If you're going to say it, you have to say it right.
2439714	2440155	Richter.
2440195	2440495	Richter.
2443024	2443844	Skypline is open.
2443864	2445585	1-877-GAME-OLR.
2445605	2448427	Your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
2448767	2450928	While we're waiting for some calls, how about some last-minute stories?
2450948	2452168	Do you have anything for us tonight, Loki?
2454429	2456711	Actually, I don't.
2458311	2458591	What?
2459192	2460272	We've actually covered everything?
2461533	2463554	Well, I mean, I'm sure there's some other stuff.
2463574	2464834	Well, thank God a call's coming in.
2466555	2467796	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2467816	2468196	Who's this?
2469602	2471163	Hi, this is Ross TLUT.
2471183	2473424	Let me shut the speakers down.
2473444	2473965	Sorry about that.
2474085	2474625	No, that's all right.
2474665	2475726	What's on your mind, Ross TLUT?
2477347	2477827	Not much.
2477847	2484091	I want to talk about the whole thing with the guy whose 360 got wiped clean.
2484732	2488554	Yeah, and then Bungie actually had to fix it and all that stuff.
2488834	2489975	What's your thoughts on that?
2491116	2494998	Well, much love to Bungie, but where the fuck is Microsoft?
2495158	2498220	They said they were going to help the guy, and then we haven't heard from them since.
2498621	2498981	Yeah.
2499611	2502952	Well, but isn't Bungie, like, oh no, because they split.
2503252	2516558	I keep wanting to say, oh, but Bungie is partially... Well, they split, but still, it wasn't Bungie's fault, it was the... And that's the thing, this wasn't, this isn't some sort of little casual accident, because, from what I understand, the console was marked as permanent marker.
2517418	2523481	So, you had to, whoever did this had to really, you know, get in there, you know what I mean?
2523681	2526802	I always thought that they just gave the console a different shell.
2527954	2530215	I think they all go through some sort of power wash.
2559701	2561381	Like a high pressure wash.
2561702	2563662	Oh, that's going to make your Xbox look new again?
2564523	2564783	Yeah.
2564963	2565724	Basically, yeah.
2565964	2567224	That's interesting.
2567304	2569545	I wonder if... Oh my gosh.
2569986	2573587	Oh yeah, and you can see... Oh, thanks for the link to the blog.
2573607	2574068	That's interesting.
2574088	2576609	You can totally see how some of the ink is just like rubbed off.
2577398	2581161	So that's like how you might put like your ring or something.
2581181	2587486	Like I'm thinking last weekend I watched my friend get her engagement ring washed and they have like a machine that does it, you know, make it look new again.
2587526	2590408	It's like kind of that type of thing, make sure Xbox 360 look new again.
2590908	2591609	That's weird.
2592410	2593330	I mean, don't get me wrong.
2593670	2598914	I'm not surprised by Microsoft having incompetent tech support.
2598934	2605780	You know, after I had my 360 sent in early November and I got a refurb and it took me...
2606913	2610696	4 months to finally get my XBLA games revalidated to the console.
2611357	2614239	You know, neither of them ever buying anything off the marketplace again.
2614359	2615340	That is a big mess.
2616001	2623427	You know, when I sent my Xbox 360 back, thankfully I only had two arcade games purchased at the time, and they're not ones I play super... Well, I take that back.
2623867	2627010	Joust was one, I haven't played that in a while, but Geometry Wars was the other.
2627490	2632755	Thankfully, I haven't had much issues, because since it is tied to your Xbox Live name, it recognizes me, you know, and all that stuff.
2633455	2636916	and it lets me play the full version but I do have to wait like a couple seconds.
2636976	2644898	I mean obviously I'm not going to get frustrated over a couple seconds but I'm just thinking like I've heard of other people who've lost a lot more than two arcade games and it's just a pain in the ass.
2644918	2651820	Well the problem with XBLA is that you cannot play your stuff offline if you do a refurb.
2653421	2653941	You know...
2654622	2656602	You have to be online at all times.
2656722	2659483	And like a couple of days ago, my internet was on the fritz and I couldn't do that.
2659543	2664444	So, you know, there goes Geometry Wars, there goes Symphony of the Night, Contra, you know, a few others.
2664604	2665024	I guess that's true.
2665124	2668685	And DarkTetsuya points out that this isn't just a Microsoft thing.
2668725	2671365	He says in chat, it's the same with Virtual Console.
2671585	2674486	When I got my Wii back, I had to re-download them, but they didn't cost extra.
2674506	2675406	They were free to replace.
2675706	2676486	Well, that's not so bad.
2676526	2677587	At least it worked then.
2677647	2680267	Well, yeah, at least you can use them without being online.
2680307	2681127	That's the important thing.
2681187	2682008	I guess that's true.
2682048	2684308	I mean, if I got to download it again, sure, whatever.
2685129	2697659	Um, but this just struck me as an especially evil thing to do to somebody, you know, because there's no reason to do that, especially as the guy said, hey, I don't want my, um, I don't want my thing cleaned, you know?
2698059	2711490	I would understand, like, if Microsoft did this whole, like, power wash thing, and, you know, they didn't, you know, I could understand how they might miss the special request, and just everything goes on the assembly line, they don't pay really any attention to it, it's, you know, fixed line, fixed...
2712111	2715993	But I think Microsoft should at least come out and let us know publicly that that's what happened.
2716453	2719214	Because Microsoft is so out there in the community.
2719274	2720354	They worked really hard.
2720794	2724476	They have Gamerscore Blog, Major Nelson, and all these people.
2724956	2729078	I'm sure these people are aware of this negative story being out there on the blog.
2729158	2734580	So I really think Microsoft will say something about it eventually and kind of admit, oops, my bad.
2735040	2737461	The problem is that Microsoft...
2738257	2739738	for everything they do in the community.
2739758	2741439	There's a million horror stories.
2741799	2744340	There's the alarming amount of red rings.
2744380	2750823	There's the nightmare with getting your stuff validated on your console so you can use it offline again.
2751364	2751984	And then there's this.
2752044	2757246	It really makes you wonder if the left hand even knows what the right hand is doing.
2757327	2758467	What do you want to bet, though?
2759628	2766171	The reason why Bungie did this for this guy is that somebody at Microsoft saw this story on the blogs, their community outreach people, and made a phone call.
2767661	2770003	I'm sure they were like, yeah, could you help us out here?
2770584	2771205	Yeah, exactly.
2771765	2772806	We fucked up.
2772826	2773647	Can you save our ass?
2775308	2775749	It happens.
2776810	2789141	Anyway, on better Microsoft news, the Financial Times is reporting that Microsoft might be considering more Blu-ray support.
2790131	2792972	Some people have even speculated a Blu-ray draw for the 360.
2793573	2803857	I have heard about that, that Microsoft is supposedly in talks with Sony about the whole Blu-ray add-on, which is a very strange kind of marriage, but I guess one step that Microsoft might have to make at this point.
2803897	2804777	Well, might have to make.
2804997	2805978	They do have to make.
2806138	2807298	Well, do they?
2807618	2813981	You have to understand the majority of people on a console at the end aren't going to be online.
2816144	2818407	You're going to have to have the offline option.
2818627	2820049	How come the Wii doesn't have to do it?
2822333	2825838	Because the Wii is not being marketed as a media center.
2826959	2828321	We've had this conversation before.
2828381	2828782	It's being...
2830176	2833298	It's being marketed on, oh, look at the cute little novelty controller, you know.
2833378	2845827	But then again, as you start adding in, you know, the forecast channel, the news channel, the weather, I'm sorry, I just said the same thing, the TV guide channel, all this other stuff, it's a different type of center of sorts.
2847768	2848108	I don't know.
2849770	2857295	I just don't see the marketing in the sort of multimedia center of the home thing, you know.
2858052	2886845	and I agree with Frisbee I don't need it to be but you know it's you know also Microsoft but it makes it appealing the reason that might stop this is that Microsoft doesn't want to be seen as admitting picking a losing side you know they pretty much had to give away those HD DVD add-ons which I thought was funny you know what I gotta wrap up so we can get some other calls but here's the thing I would kind of close on this I would bet that Microsoft doesn't end up doing it and they'll just build it into their next system
2888427	2894211	That's my guess, the 720 would be... I mean, I would imagine both the 720 and the PS4 would be Blu-ray.
2894691	2897713	Right, and we're probably years off from both, but I think you're right.
2897753	2902516	I think if they do talk to him about Blu-ray, I think it'll wait until the next Xbox system.
2904577	2905058	Yeah.
2905158	2908900	We've got to let you go, Rusty, because we've got to get some other calls, but thanks so much for your call.
2909180	2909621	Have a good one.
2909921	2910581	All right, have a good one.
2910661	2911142	Take care, buddy.
2912062	2913603	Bye.
2913663	2917986	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
2918482	2919463	That call was seven minutes.
2919483	2920804	I tried to limit him to about four.
2921425	2922485	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2922525	2922866	Who's this?
2923887	2925308	Yo, it's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.
2925328	2925608	How you doing?
2925648	2927229	Xenocore from Ultimate Quest.
2927249	2929131	How are things doing on the Ultimate Quest, Xenocore?
2929972	2941521	Well, they've been sort of hectic considering we've been on and off on our weekends, mainly because I went to MegaCon this last weekend up in Orlando and doing a little bit of coverage here and there.
2942102	2944784	My first one, actually, I just popped a conch area on MegaCon.
2945845	2946285	Check that out.
2946306	2946886	What an interesting...
2947239	2949561	What's the website again for folks who want to check out that?
2951262	2952783	Well, for the convention or for our show?
2953103	2953503	For the show.
2954664	2956765	Well, the show is at ultimatequest.net.
2958447	2960908	You may hear about something on it last week since I missed recording.
2961208	2962910	I didn't get back till late this evening.
2964050	2966292	But yeah, man, Megacon was something else.
2966352	2966912	My goodness.
2967132	2968753	Is that what you called in to talk about tonight was Megacon?
2968793	2969114	What's up?
2969894	2970555	Well, yeah.
2970575	2975478	I mean, on top of that, they had the first Smash Brothers tournament I happened to catch, which is kind of interesting.
2976957	2978038	The cosplayers, man.
2980359	2982500	I wasn't ready for that level of dedication at all.
2982700	2985462	Dude, there's some cosplayers that are so good at what they do.
2985522	2987383	It is astounding.
2987443	2988383	That's love right there.
2988943	2991085	What were some of the cool cosplays you saw, Xenocor?
2991285	2994086	Well, I got to mention this one that stood out for everything.
2994406	3001050	A 14-year-old girl doing the Mighty Edward from Cowboy Bebop in character all three days.
3001690	3003491	Laptop on her head the entire time.
3004712	3004852	Wow.
3004872	3005492	That was impressive.
3005936	3006497	Lost Odyssey
3019666	3020807	We on our show did not.
3020887	3024210	Henderson Man actually spoke up for the show to review that one.
3024950	3026351	I haven't grabbed it yet.
3026811	3030994	I'm just kind of curious because I know you guys kind of specialize in the role-playing games.
3031034	3034237	I'm kind of curious, and maybe I'll have to wait until you guys tape a future episode.
3034257	3040001	I'm kind of curious of your general thoughts on the game because the critics overall kind of dogged it a little bit, but I'm in love with it.
3040161	3041962	I think it's a fantastic game.
3043471	3049858	Well, the main thing that caught my attention is something Henderson mentioned, is that you can't out-level the bosses in Lost Odyssey.
3050459	3054663	The bosses level according to what level you are, so the bosses are always difficult.
3054683	3055104	Not really.
3055364	3057066	No wonder there's such pains in the ass.
3057306	3057727	Not really.
3058307	3058888	They don't level.
3059557	3060378	They don't level?
3060678	3067562	No, because there's actually some guides out there, the Prima guides and stuff, that tell you what level you should be at to play the boss.
3067963	3071765	I mean, if you would have to grind a little bit, you can't just go from one boss to the next.
3071865	3077949	Is it maybe because even though the bosses level up, you get more skills, so it makes it easier regardless?
3078730	3084734	That could be my thought, is that maybe, yeah, the bosses are leveling up, but since you get more skills, you get power on them that way, if that makes sense.
3086015	3087716	Because a large part of the game is skills.
3090327	3093410	Everything I've got so far is based on Henderson Man's review.
3094751	3097933	I will be playing it myself sooner or later as soon as a budget allows for it.
3098694	3101356	But until then, I can only go by word of mouth pretty much.
3102117	3104018	Well, I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Xenocore.
3104098	3108181	I just had to ask because it's been a large part of my gaming time lately.
3108702	3109683	What else did you call in to talk about?
3109723	3110103	Anything else?
3110904	3116308	Well, mainly it was just that I happened to come across my first con and decided to share it with fellow con lovers, so.
3117552	3123014	It's been a while since I've been to a con, but definitely we have Fanime coming up in May or June, right?
3123034	3123554	When's Fanime?
3123574	3124894	Is it Memorial Day weekend, Fanime?
3125615	3126015	I think it is.
3126175	3129316	Yeah, but I'm probably not going this year.
3129736	3131236	Oh, is it the same time as your road trip?
3132317	3132417	Oh.
3133377	3133457	Oh.
3134057	3137218	So, oh, well, that's a bummer, because we always do our show there.
3138599	3140159	But let's see.
3140359	3142960	Well, there's other cons coming up, and I still want to go to that one in Chicago.
3143100	3143880	ASIN, is that it?
3144020	3145121	I really want to go to ASIN.
3145621	3145981	We'll see.
3146101	3146421	We'll see.
3146977	3149559	and I have information on that too.
3150219	3150479	Later.
3150939	3151380	Later then.
3151660	3152100	Later it is.
3153161	3156302	Xenocore, anything else before I let you go?
3156362	3161005	That and the largest Yuri-Yowie argument I've ever heard in my entire life.
3161065	3162126	Other than that, that was fine.
3164347	3166248	Some things you can never escape at cons.
3167148	3168549	Just go to YowieCon.
3168569	3169770	The whole thing is an argument.
3171371	3174773	Xenocore, thanks so much for your call and have a good one and good luck with your own show.
3175748	3176548	All right, take it easy, guys.
3176768	3177048	You too.
3177108	3177408	Bye-bye.
3178609	3180669	What exactly is the Yuri-Yowie argument?
3181009	3181370	Wait, hold on.
3181390	3182430	I'm going to ask our next caller.
3182830	3183710	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3183730	3184130	Who's this?
3184951	3185491	You know what?
3185511	3186331	I don't care who it is.
3187391	3188111	I don't care who it is.
3188231	3192633	I want to ask you, DJ Ranma S, I want to ask you, what is the Yuri-Yowie argument?
3197494	3198354	Oh, man.
3198494	3200935	What exactly is the Yuri-Yowie argument?
3201590	3206313	You got these fangirls who argue about what's better, Yuri or Yaoi.
3206653	3208794	They run around with these paddles.
3208814	3212356	They will start smacking you with them if you do not agree with them.
3213377	3213977	This is true.
3213997	3218080	That's why I said going to YaoiCon is like a whole argument in and of itself.
3219480	3224563	My other friend Jasmine, she has this priestess outfit.
3224583	3229246	She walks around with an anti-Yaoi paper fan that she smacks people with.
3230472	3231973	That is nothing short of amazing.
3232053	3233495	I don't know how else to describe it.
3233695	3235696	But they yell at each other.
3235716	3239039	I mean, this sounds like stupid fun, but they actually get upset over this.
3239059	3243163	They really do think they're going to beat it into you to yell at you.
3244521	3245522	Some of them do.
3245622	3254127	I mean, a couple of years back at Animazement, we had like this line of people on one side, you had the ninjas, you had on the other side the pirates.
3254387	3258029	We were shouting back and forth, ninjas were better or pirates were better.
3258049	3260530	It got to the point where staff had to break us all up.
3260890	3267154	And then maybe about an hour later, we started a conga line singing ninja rap all throughout the entire convention area.
3267514	3268615	Cons are so weird.
3268635	3270636	Well, there was...
3271468	3276850	The funny thing about Anime Expo every year is that wherever they schedule it, they also schedule some sort of religious convention.
3277911	3280932	So you get the people preaching to the cosplayers in line.
3282213	3290236	And one year a bunch of us just started just completely telling them off in various other languages that weren't necessarily Japanese.
3292037	3295959	I know a lot of people that would pay a lot of money to see women beat each other up with paddles.
3297800	3300761	So you can get this all for free at your local anime convention.
3301638	3304619	Pretty much, and Jamie, there is a voice actor.
3304659	3305539	His name is Vic.
3305579	3306879	He's like a born-again Christian.
3306899	3308460	He's the voice of Ed from FMA.
3309140	3315722	At AnimeCon, he has like a panel of Sunday morning service for con goers to come and arrive for service.
3316742	3318263	That's kind of cool.
3318563	3319803	Yeah, that's kind of neat.
3319903	3321424	I've seen that happen at various conventions.
3321864	3323784	You know, for people that want to do that, why not?
3324484	3324825	Why not?
3326005	3326405	Definitely.
3327784	3334267	Here's another quote that I love from RossDLUT in chat says, This is different from console fanboys how?
3336228	3339750	Xbox, Playstation, Xbox, Playstation, Wii!
3340891	3350357	I don't know about you guys, but I'd rather see a bunch of girls in cute outfits screaming Yaoi versus Yuri than a bunch of fanboys shouting what console is better, you know?
3350697	3351717	I'd have to agree with you there.
3352338	3352558	Yeah.
3353618	3356080	Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
3357225	3357866	A couple of things.
3358766	3360568	The 360 with the missing autographs.
3360928	3363710	If it was me, I would have bit the bullet and bought a new console.
3364631	3364851	What?
3366052	3366952	I would have done the same thing.
3367673	3369214	Yeah, that's exactly what I would have done.
3371075	3372737	But they gave him back the console.
3372757	3374698	The problem wasn't that he didn't have a working console.
3374798	3375239	I don't get it.
3375479	3376860	I wouldn't have left that to fate.
3376940	3380743	I would not have put in something that valuable in the hands of other people.
3380823	3381223	I get it.
3381403	3381784	I get it.
3382104	3384886	So you would never have sent the console in to be repaired in the first place.
3385598	3386199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3406605	3407246	No, no, no.
3407306	3410689	See, I got into Prodigy during the age of Windows and stuff like that.
3410749	3411250	Oh, no, no, no, no.
3411270	3412091	That's what I got into.
3412391	3412952	Oh, no, no, no.
3413192	3413933	I had Prodigy.
3413953	3415374	You go way old school, yeah.
3415494	3420079	I had DOS-based Prodigy, HWPD42B.
3421220	3426045	I remember Radio Shack stores had Prodigy set up for people for free to try out and stuff.
3426085	3426285	Yep.
3426665	3428307	That's how we found out about it the first time.
3429547	3431648	and you know what happened to Prodigy, right?
3432649	3436310	Didn't they get absolved into, basically they're like an ISP now, aren't they?
3437030	3438531	Or they're a part of Yahoo, aren't they?
3439511	3442753	Not really, they're like the red-headed bastard stepchild of AT&T.
3443053	3450036	Like about one or two years ago they were trying to sell off the name of everybody and the whole thing to the highest bidder and they're still trying to do that.
3450720	3450800	What?
3450820	3452721	ColecoVision Adam Which is ironic if people know you very well
3478387	3478768	Mm-hmm.
3479549	3480610	I'll see you guys later.
3481651	3482551	Take care, Ranma.
3482932	3483332	All right.
3483412	3483833	Bye.
3484053	3485394	Or should I say ColecoVision?
3485955	3486255	All right.
3487957	3488838	Colecoman!
3489058	3491100	If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call.
3491120	3493002	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3493082	3494743	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3495604	3500509	Meanwhile, I did actually get a last-minute news story from somebody.
3502251	3502631	Where is it?
3504677	3515164	Video game companies think they might be able to survive the slowing down of the economy.
3515864	3521668	Apparently video games have defied the sagging retail sales figures of December 2007.
3522508	3526091	Nintendo actually talked to CNBC, specifically Reggie Fils-Aimé,
3526713	3530654	I was going to say I have a couple last minute stories for after this.
3530674	3531274	Hi, this is Osferd.
3556110	3557131	All right, that's all right.
3569724	3577486	No, it's just pretty interesting with the whole Yowie Yuri argument, and I'm actually going to be going to my first convention in May, so I'll be sure to look out for that.
3578426	3578906	You know what?
3578967	3582607	Yeah, just avoid the women that have the Yowie Yuri paddles unless you're into that.
3582627	3583948	And watch out for the free hugs.
3583988	3585068	You don't know if they've been tested.
3585228	3588429	Yeah, if somebody's wearing a glomp sign, run the other way.
3591010	3594691	I want to experience full on, so I'm actually going to go run towards them for the heck of it.
3595671	3597071	Okay, don't say we didn't warn you, bud.
3597572	3599092	Rama wants to know what con it is.
3600925	3603887	Um, I think it's, I think it's Anime Central.
3603947	3604708	It's in Illinois.
3604728	3605768	That's ASIN.
3605788	3607169	That's the one that we're wanting to go to.
3607189	3608210	Yeah, we're thinking about going.
3608870	3610111	That's a big one.
3610131	3611172	Oh, that's pretty cool.
3611192	3611272	Yeah.
3611912	3612293	We'll see.
3612393	3612633	I don't know.
3612653	3614934	It's probably too late to get a panel on that and all that stuff.
3614954	3615315	We'll see.
3615815	3616535	Not necessarily.
3616616	3617036	Hmm.
3617216	3618317	Maybe we might have to make that happen.
3618797	3622159	If not, we could always do the, uh, OLR Hospitality Suite or something silly.
3622219	3622499	I don't know.
3622519	3623180	We'll think of something.
3623720	3623900	So.
3624241	3624541	Yeah.
3624561	3624621	Um.
3625592	3628113	I've just been playing lots of Brawl What are your thoughts on Brawl?
3628153	3628734	Did they get it right?
3628754	3629714	Was it worth the wait?
3629734	3631355	Yeah, I'd say it's definitely worth the wait
3653274	3656536	But like really my only frustration is with the online play.
3657157	3659818	So I just can't freaking connect and play against anyone.
3661059	3663461	Is your Wii far away from your Wi-Fi router?
3665362	3667503	No, it's only like 10 feet away from it.
3667924	3668344	Oh, weird.
3669096	3671237	You know, I did play online.
3671277	3672518	I haven't gotten the friends thing to work.
3672538	3674119	I'm going to try tonight after the show.
3674959	3683985	But I have heard, or I did play the random people one, which is a little silly because it's just like playing the computer pretty much, except you know somebody real is controlling it.
3684725	3685826	But it wasn't bad.
3685866	3687907	It was relatively lag-free, so I was pretty excited.
3688867	3690689	Oh, yeah.
3690789	3697292	I just kept on getting error codes and ads saying, and it would just cut me out, saying the transmission has ended or something like that.
3697312	3698233	I was just like, what the heck?
3698884	3701446	But I haven't actually tried doing it through friend code, so I don't know.
3701486	3702447	Maybe that'll work better.
3702747	3703128	Who knows?
3704169	3704429	All right.
3704469	3706130	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Osfer?
3707631	3708372	No, that's about it.
3708752	3708952	All right.
3708972	3710193	Well, thanks so much for the phone call.
3710634	3711254	You have a good week.
3711414	3715598	And try to take that Smash Brothers in limitation.
3715738	3716999	Don't OD on it, okay?
3717939	3718160	Yeah.
3718360	3718660	All right.
3718820	3719301	Take care, buddy.
3720401	3720682	All right.
3720702	3720902	See you.
3721863	3722283	All right.
3722708	3724329	That's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
3724369	3725609	Thank you guys so much for your calls.
3725629	3726990	And if you didn't get through tonight, don't worry.
3727010	3728010	There's always next week.
3728231	3730252	Or you can always leave us a voicemail.
3730292	3732232	We do play the voicemails once in a while.
3732353	3736074	I know we didn't play them tonight, but we'll probably get to some more next week.
3736094	3737915	1-877-GAME-OLR whenever we're not live.
3738555	3740396	So you said you had some last-minute stories, Loki.
3740416	3742457	Yes, real quick here.
3742677	3743198	There's two things.
3744858	3748860	That show Dexter you may have heard about.
3749320	3752522	They're actually now starting to, I guess, replay it on the CVS.
3753863	3762568	It's about a serial killer who, instead of going around killing other people, he goes around killing serial killers.
3762748	3764829	So they kind of fight his urge.
3765209	3768631	It's currently running Showtime, and apparently they're making a game from it.
3769571	3770992	So that's kind of interesting.
3771772	3773914	The other thing is the game Turning Point.
3774374	3779356	Apparently the reviews haven't been too good for it, and according to Turning Point's CEO...
3781411	3783192	of the company Spark Unlimited.
3783292	3788796	He's quoted that Turning Point is too high concept for reviewers.
3789876	3794419	They just... It wasn't for the critics, apparently.
3794919	3806907	It was more, I guess, a game that was never meant for core gamers that is meant for those who aren't wanting to look at a game with a critical eye, I guess.
3808288	3808548	So...
3809414	3813616	He's basically saying that the game reviewers don't know how to review his game.
3814136	3816257	Because it was supposed to be crappy, I guess.
3817257	3817597	I don't know.
3818137	3818378	Huh.
3820839	3821279	All right.
3821899	3825180	I know his next game that they're doing, was it Legendary?
3825580	3827321	That one that's by Gamecock, I guess?
3827421	3828302	Legendary the Box?
3829082	3830102	But now it's just Legendary.
3833904	3834764	Who knows?
3836545	3836925	All right.
3837386	3840107	Well, that is going to do it, I guess, for tonight's Last Minute Stories.
3840427	3841327	That's it for now.
3841567	3841947	All right.
3842027	3845288	So that's going to bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
3845788	3849269	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting Independent Radio.
3849329	3850129	You guys are awesome.
3850629	3853330	I want to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts.
3853370	3855990	And then actually, we're breaking form a little bit tonight.
3856010	3859151	I have one more story that's very important that we want to do at the very, very end.
3859431	3861872	But we're going to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts.
3861992	3862232	Loki.
3863790	3891669	my final thought is I want to finish Space Emissary mode this week and god damn it I wish my 360 the other one I'm fixing fucking works because it's three ringed and been fixed and three ringed and sort of been fixed for weeks now now it's three ringed right now so I have to heat it up again and I think it's just broken so but I've done so many mods to it that I kind of want it to be fixed because it'll look like a Frankenstein's monster when I'm done this is a long ass final thought
3893459	3897424	DarkSakura, your final thought Say no to bullshit
3913081	3915504	Really good final thought, appreciate that.
3916144	3930638	We are going to close tonight on this, and I hate to end the show on such a downer, but it is very important to acknowledge, and I'm sure if you have an internet connection you've heard about it this week, we have to acknowledge the passing of Gary Gygax, which happened this week.
