0	5320	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, March the 9th of 2008 for this part
5320	11160	B of our podcast, which we hope we'll actually upload to our feed this week with no problems,
11160	12160	unlike last time.
12160	16140	But let me not jinx things, let me shut up and let Loki get back into the gaming news
16140	17400	this week.
17400	24840	This week, well, of course we knew this was coming, but now, other than Steam, you can
24840	30720	now buy the, or soon, you will be able to buy the components of the Orange box separately.
30720	37200	You'll be hitting retail stores on April 9th, you'll be able to buy Portal for $19.99, and
37200	47480	then of course Half-Life 2, Episode 1 and 2 for $29.99 and Team Fortress 2 for $29.99.
47480	51880	All sold separately now, so, awesome.
51880	55720	I don't know, Half-Life 2 I don't think was that expensive to begin with, I mean, might
55720	57080	as well just buy them all.
57080	61320	I think this is a really good way for people who haven't seen Portal yet to get it, because
61320	65920	I know people that would consider that $60 for Portal was a decent buy, and you got all
65920	67700	these other cool games free.
67700	71000	So honestly, this is an excellent, I mean, not to knock the other games, because the
71000	74800	Orange box is a great combo package, but certainly there's a lot of people that want to see Portal
74800	75800	by itself.
75800	79400	I guess if you've owned, if you already owned like Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, although if
79400	83680	you buy the episode pack, you're getting one all over again, so, I don't know.
83680	85240	Oh, go ahead.
85240	89120	That whole bunch of Half-Life is just epic.
89120	90520	It is very epic.
90520	94280	I never realized you were quite the Half-Life fan, DarkStalker, but during our bonus segment
94280	99040	tonight which only the live listeners heard, you're quite a Half-Life fan, I didn't realize.
99040	103480	Well, keep in mind, I can't really play them because I get bad motion sickness when I play
103480	104480	them.
104480	105800	That doesn't mean you don't recognize a good game when you see one.
105800	109720	That's right, and I, you know, I love the story for Half-Life 2, I mean, Half-Life was
109720	115360	sort of like, oh, you crawl through some pipes and you kill some aliens, but I thought that
115360	121640	Half-Life 2 had a very, actually a really involved story, I thought it was very good.
121640	122640	It is very rad.
122640	127720	I was basically loading up everything on my iPhone and listening to it on YouTube at my
127720	128720	desk at work.
128720	132520	RossdillUT has some advice, and I'm kind of curious if it actually would work or not.
132520	133800	He says play on a smaller screen.
133800	134800	Would that help?
134800	135800	No?
135800	136800	That's too bad.
136800	139520	It actually has gotten a little bit better since we started playing on the widescreen.
139520	140520	Huh.
140520	145600	Because I have a 50-inch widescreen TV, and it was a lot worse on our old CRT, which was
145600	146600	smaller.
146600	147600	Weird.
147600	149800	I kind of get the logic behind what he's suggesting, though.
149800	151400	It's kind of weird that it's the reverse.
151400	153680	The flatter the screen, the less sick I get.
153680	154680	Huh.
154680	160360	And I also get less eye strain on my old Trinitron versus my old CRT screen.
160360	161360	Yeah, the eye strain.
161360	163720	Or my standard monitor.
163720	164720	Interesting.
164720	166600	But it still is bad.
166600	167880	No matter what, it still is bad.
167880	171480	However, nothing makes me as freaking motion sick as GoldenEye64 did.
171480	173280	All right.
173280	174440	Well anyhow, moving on.
174440	179040	Speaking of splitting up, Ziff Davis Media owns a lot of stuff, and after this they might
179040	180920	have to split some of it off.
180920	182120	No, I'm just kidding.
182120	188080	I'm not here yelling doom and gloom, but certainly that's what a lot of people are speculating
188080	190800	after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week.
190800	191800	That's right.
191800	193960	Ziff Davis filed for bankruptcy earlier this week.
193960	198280	They had $390 million in debt since last August.
198280	203000	Now, if this bankruptcy is actually approved by the bankruptcy courts, Ziff Davis is going
203000	204360	to have to restructure some things.
204360	206780	I don't know if that necessarily means they're going to unload some of their properties.
206780	208680	I don't know how that actually works.
208680	209680	I'm no legal expert.
209680	213920	Maybe folks in chat can give us some light on that.
213920	221560	But they're going to have to somehow basically rearrange things to pay off this $400 million.
221560	228000	However, they are saying that all the video game stuff, it should be business as usual.
228000	232360	Jason Young, who is the CEO of Ziff Davis, has this quote, quote, today's restructuring
232360	236340	agreement goes a long way towards resolving the burdens of a debt load and capital structure
236340	240440	established seven years ago during a leveraged buyout of the company.
240440	242440	That's Chapter 11, right?
242440	243440	Yeah.
243440	244440	Yeah.
244440	249840	Basically, a Chapter 11 is just strictly for businesses only, because we actually, at my
249840	254960	work, we occasionally get a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in for multi-family homes, basically apartments,
254960	257680	condos, that type of thing.
257680	263360	And this is basically done for the purpose of paying back and restructuring their debt.
263360	265960	It's to give the company a chance to make a fresh start.
265960	266960	All right.
266960	270080	Well, we'll see what happens.
270080	273800	And of course, people are screaming doom and gloom, and our chat room is no different.
273800	276440	P.K. Jr. 92 says, does this mean OneUp will die?
276440	277440	No.
277440	278440	Doubt it.
278440	279440	I mean, it's one of their more successful properties.
279440	280440	It's one of their more successful properties, right?
280440	283080	Bankruptcy doesn't really kill something, so.
283080	287440	Well, the bad thing about Chapter 11 is that it's actually really bad for their stockholders.
287440	288440	Gotcha.
288440	294320	Because if their debts exceed their assets, then when the bankruptcy is done, all of their
294320	297320	rights and interests are terminated.
297320	302400	Basically all the creditors have a new business to start with, nothing on the books.
302400	307440	S.J. 100 Matt says, if Dave is going bankrupt, could mean the end of digital life.
307440	313640	I don't know about that, because they were a major sponsor, but I don't know.
313640	315360	We'll see.
315360	319560	I guess that's too bad, though, for them, I guess.
319560	325680	But business sucks sometimes, so hopefully this will be a nice, fresh start for them.
325680	329340	That's what you can usually tell if there's rumors going out about a company going under
329340	331840	when people start selling off their stock.
331840	332840	True.
332840	333840	Anyway.
333840	335680	That's all I got.
335680	339480	Well, how about something that's just a little bit happier, huh?
339480	340480	Sure.
340480	341480	Midway!
341480	348760	We like Midway, except Midway's been losing some money, too, about, well, more around
348760	354560	the amount of $97.4 million last financial year.
354560	363280	So they're trying to cater more towards the casual gamer by having an online portal for
363280	365040	a lot of those games that are out.
365040	370520	I mean, basically, it's just, well, I just completely lost my train of thought.
370520	371520	That's okay.
371520	375400	Midway owns the rights to a lot of classic franchises, though, right?
375400	376400	Yeah.
376400	380400	I mean, Midway, it was, wasn't Midway that brought us out like Mortal Kombat?
380400	381400	Yeah.
381400	384200	Well, I mean, I'm going even further back than that, because I'm thinking about those
384200	389440	like classic packs with like Robotron and Joust and, you know, all that.
389440	391040	They've re-tashed that stuff a thousand times.
391040	395080	I wonder if this is kind of a part of how they're going to launch a more casual games
395080	396080	portal.
396080	400760	Or, because, you know, I could think of casual games as old-school games that were very simple,
400760	405560	or I could think of them as, you know, PopCap-type casual games, like Bejeweled and stuff, that,
405560	408040	again, you know, very easy to pick up and play type games.
408040	412120	I would go in probably with the older games and say, like, re-release that shit over and
412120	414040	over and over and over and over again.
414040	418600	Well, basically, they're only saying that two titles have been out that's used any of
418600	424200	the different type of proprietary technology that they've been working on so far today,
424200	426200	and that was just Stranglehold and Blacksite.
426200	432080	Well, you know, it's unfortunate for Midway, but the games they've released recently haven't
432080	433560	been anything to really scream about.
433560	434560	I mean, I guess there was Unreal.
434560	437920	I mean, don't get me wrong, but some of those other games just didn't really live up to
437920	440320	the hype, unfortunately.
440320	443320	Which is a bummer, because Midway's given us a lot of great games, too, but I think
443320	445400	they just had a rough 07.
445400	450800	So who knows, I heart classic games, though, and if the Portal is built good, where it
450800	457420	does online high scoreboards and maybe some achievement point type thing and some clever
457420	464960	new little innovative things that make it stand out, I would probably check it out.
464960	473640	So I guess we're coming up on the 10th anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast, and to commemorate
473640	479760	that, Sega of Japan has updated their Dreamcast.com website with a question.
479760	481640	Do you still own a Dreamcast?
481640	482840	Yes.
482840	488560	If you do, what you can do is submit your serial number, and they will basically register
488560	494040	an account with you with user.Dreamcast.com, and you'll get an email, which is your serial
494040	498600	number at Dreamcast.com, Gmail account.
498600	500200	What the hell is that going to do for me?
500200	501200	I don't know.
501200	502200	Maybe there's some more stuff that they're going to do.
502200	504960	Right now, actually, the website's down, so apparently enough people think that that's
504960	505960	interesting.
505960	508920	I could register both of mine.
508920	512800	There's hardcore Sega people out there, hard fucking core Sega people out there.
512800	514920	Jamie's kind of borderline one of them, I think.
514920	515920	I have two Dreamcasts.
515920	519760	Maybe I should register mine so I can have another spam email address.
519760	520760	Why not?
520760	521760	It would be fun.
521760	522760	That's weird, though.
522760	523760	You just have your serial number.
523760	526940	I mean, it almost makes me wonder, like, wow, could they release an email program for the
526940	529520	Dreamcast or something really weird all these years later?
529520	533320	But yeah, the Dreamcast came out, what, $9,999, but I imagine it was a little bit before that
533320	534320	in Japan, right?
534320	535320	We're bringing it back.
535320	539360	I think that I got my other one in, I want to say, April?
539360	541640	Yeah, it was probably a few months earlier in Japan.
541640	543560	Yeah, because I had my Dreamcast way early.
543560	544920	Yeah, well, why couldn't they?
544920	551680	I mean, that would be kind of cool to bring it back, just make it all open source type
551680	552680	stuff.
552680	553680	You know what I mean?
553680	558160	I mean, they already have a pretty big open source community for homebrew stuff, but just
558160	562240	a lot of these portable game systems, even like the DS and stuff, aren't that powerful.
562240	566480	I mean, you could probably do a lot on the Dreamcast that you could do on those systems,
566480	569400	so why not?
569400	572960	Well, we'll see what happens, see what this develops into.
572960	575800	I hope we haven't heard the last of the Dreamcast.
575800	578760	Even if it's something, I mean, obviously we don't expect a lot, but even something
578760	582840	little that would be fun, I think them putting out some type of, like, disk image you could
582840	587480	burn and play on your Dreamcast for, like, a 10th anniversary thing would be the cutest
587480	588480	thing.
588480	589480	I mean, it would be fun.
589480	590480	You know we'd all download it and check it out.
590480	593040	Like, a 10th anniversary Choo-Choo Rocket, come on.
593040	594040	Who wouldn't want to check it out?
594040	595040	You know, I have a press kit for Choo-Choo Rocket.
595040	596040	Do you really?
596040	597520	Yep, somewhere, still complete.
597520	599920	Wow, what kind of special stuff was in it?
599920	602240	Just like pictures and write-ups and stuff about the game.
602240	605040	It was just in a box, a big Choo-Choo Rocket box.
605040	610040	Well, technology has come a long way since the days of the Dreamcast, you know, now we
610040	614800	have the Xbox 360, which are on live and all that stuff, and once you know it, it didn't
614800	621520	take too long before we have yet another story coming from a CBS news station, WCBS-TV in
621520	628680	New York is reporting, and this is the headline, Alarming Trend Online Video Game Predators.
628680	631760	Well, here's what the Predators story is about.
631760	634420	It talks about this boy who's 12 years old.
634420	639580	He loves playing the PlayStation 3 game Burnout Paradise, and he says he plays against strangers
639580	643700	he knows only by their username, and when you cause people to crash, the webcam takes
643700	645240	a snapshot of the player's reaction.
645240	647880	I didn't know it did that on the PlayStation 3, too.
647880	650480	Yeah, with their eye camera.
650480	651480	Interesting.
651480	656520	Well, here's what happened, is that according to the story, apparently things were going
656520	662560	fine and then this guy crashed into somebody and the webcam picture came back, and it was
662560	663560	a butt.
663560	668760	Somebody put their butt on the webcam, but it actually, I don't know, it gets a little
668760	674660	sick because Najee's father, whose name is Charles Johnson, said that the image showed
674660	676380	a lot more than just a butt.
676380	680360	It was a picture of the guy mooning the camera and you could actually see his genitals.
680360	681360	Gross!
681360	683880	Why would you send that picture over?
683880	688520	That takes talent, too, because the camera takes the picture pretty quick, so you'd have
688520	692000	to crash your car in, like, I don't know, you'd have to...
692000	695000	Or you'd have to have your friends standing there, waiting to go.
695000	697320	Oh, there you go, yeah.
697320	698320	Never thought about that.
698320	699320	Come on!
699320	700440	Come on!
700440	704480	It's one thing to do that to your friends and people on your friends list and stuff
704480	709040	and people you know very well, but it's another to do it to strangers, especially, you know,
709040	712480	when you consider that it might be a 12-year-old kid who's playing the game.
712480	717800	And as sensationalist as the story is, it does make some decent points.
717800	723000	The father said that he thought it would be fine to play because the game is rated E for
723000	727720	everyone, or E10 plus or whatever, however, of course, the ESRB does have that warning.
727720	732000	It's in the beginning of the fucking game, for a second there, and you have to hit a
732000	734040	button to go past it.
734040	739440	But at the same time, I understand that, but at the same time, come on, what fucking moron
739440	740440	did this?
740440	745760	I mean, to show your butt to your friends is one thing, but to show it to complete strangers
745760	750980	when it might be 12-year-old kids playing the game is kind of messed up, and causes
750980	755040	things like this to happen, where now the media runs with it and talks about sexual
755040	756040	predators.
756040	758600	It's because the media- They were probably high, I don't think they're
758600	762600	sexual predators, they're probably drug users, not that that makes it right.
762600	764420	It's because the media has nothing to talk about.
764420	769080	I'll give you a perfect example, we were watching the local news yesterday, and they were talking
769080	773240	about a fire that happened in North Carolina.
773240	775240	We live in California.
775240	781480	I mean, how fucking slow is the news if you're talking about a building fire in another state?
781480	787720	Oh, and then they perceived this show a, what was it, a chicken sledding, and that's how
787720	789260	slow the news was.
789260	792880	That's why they run with this crap, because they can spin it, and it's an interesting
792880	793880	story.
793880	799560	It'll put some, not really put asses in seats, but you know what I mean, tunes people in.
799560	803560	Rob with two Bs pours a little salt in the wound, says California has enough of its own
803560	804560	fires.
804560	805560	Oh.
805560	806560	Not right now they don't.
806560	808880	They're in between fires, C, sir.
808880	812640	Pendro in chat says this, you should be able to rate people as you play them, like feedback
812640	813640	on eBay or something.
813640	817600	And of course the 360 has a system kind of like that, but what about PS3?
817600	819280	I'm not sure.
819280	823400	I don't know, maybe.
823400	827480	I think there needs to be a way where something can be done a little more immediately.
827480	833280	I mean, I know on Xbox 360, they swear up and down, they do review that stuff, but there's
833280	836480	got to be something a little more instantaneous that can be done.
836480	837600	You know what I mean?
837600	839040	I don't know.
839040	840840	I don't know if you have to pay people.
840840	842120	My God, dude.
842120	843120	It's a person's ass.
843120	845840	It's not like you're scarred for fucking life.
845840	847960	Well, I kind of see it.
847960	851960	That is kind of nasty, like if you're a 12 year old kid, because they're saying it's
851960	856680	not just his butt, but I guess the whole naughty bits were dangling there too, so you know.
856680	857680	Okay, okay.
857680	858680	Yeah.
858680	859680	I'm so sorry.
859680	862760	Yeah, tomorrow they're going to go out and murder people because they've been severely
862760	863760	scarred.
863760	866400	That's right, you better watch your kids now because now they're going to go on a murderous
866400	872340	rage and go and rape and pillage and fucking, the world is over for you and your family.
872340	875320	Might as well, you know, leave the country.
875320	876320	That's all.
876320	881640	Rasteel UT says, PlayStation 3 lets you block people, but there's no rating system for people.
881640	884800	He also says you're overreacting.
884800	886520	Dark Soccer, you're awfully quiet.
886520	888440	What are your thoughts on this?
888440	893600	It's a butt and it's, you know, dangly bits, I guess.
893600	895720	So you're saying, you know what?
895720	898880	Maybe we should just stop being so frickin' sensitive to...
898880	902480	I really think, that said, if people didn't make a big deal out of this crap, then it
902480	904640	wouldn't, you know, be such an issue.
904640	905640	All right.
905640	909600	Well, if you have some feedback, you know I sent us an email, mailbagorangelanatrader.com,
909600	911560	but regardless, you know what?
911560	915560	Thinking about that this guy was so stupid to do this to strangers kind of pisses me
915560	920240	off and makes me a little bit angsty that this guy was such a moron, so it's time to
920240	921240	have the FUs of the week.
921240	943000	I have a few FUs to compile.
943000	948120	My first one goes, of course, to Daylight Savings Time, because I went to bed at 4.30am
948120	951960	and, of course, woke up at 1.30am.
951960	956280	My next one goes towards the guy who was driving the red pickup truck, which, by the way, was
956280	959600	a Ford, and Ford stands for Fix-Off and Repair Daily.
959600	964760	Anyway, I was in the left lane and he was in the right lane, and then he just cut out
964760	969560	in front of me, like, literally with inches to spare to get into the turning lane on the
969560	973680	left side of me, and I was like, dude, where'd you learn how to drive, you know?
973680	977160	Oh, I'm sorry, you did learn how to drive, if you're driving like that.
977160	980720	I hate stupid people who drive.
980720	991560	And also, another FU goes to my cat for throwing up in an inappropriate place.
991560	992560	Sorry to hear it.
992560	995440	Although, she's a cute baby and I forgive her.
995440	996440	Logie!
996440	1001460	FU to this guy named Michael T-something or I don't remember his last name, but apparently
1001460	1009760	I knew enough because we sat there at dinner on Saturday, no, Friday, I'm sorry, and this
1009760	1014960	guy went on and on and on and on about his fucking life next to us.
1014960	1017840	Apparently this couple was on their first date or whatever.
1017840	1021120	I feel sorry for the woman because this guy just went on and on.
1021120	1028000	Yeah, one time I had a felony, but they cleared it, so it's all good now, and, you know, I
1028000	1034160	took in my truck because I'm a, what was it, he was a plumbing inspector, and I took in
1034160	1037440	my truck one time and they gave me a loaner car and it was an undercover cop car, and
1037440	1042000	so I drove through the ghetto and everyone was like, oh my god, it's the cops, ah!
1042000	1045520	Went on and on for two hours and he was still talking the entire time.
1045520	1051000	I don't think the woman got a word in, so, sucks for, don't meet people on MySpace, this
1051000	1052960	is what happens.
1052960	1061320	All right, my FUs of the week go to also Daylight Savings Time, I think it's horrible, and losing
1061320	1067920	sleep sucks, I hate that, and, gosh, I can't really think of a lot else, I think just Daylight
1067920	1069960	Savings Time makes up the bulk of my FUs this week.
1069960	1071600	I think it's unnecessary.
1071600	1075480	It is a necessary FU, because when you lose sleep, there's never a good thing to come
1075480	1082040	out of that, so, there you have it, our FUs of the week.
1082040	1086600	I do want to point this out real quick, Toshin is in our Justin TV chat and says that the
1086600	1094040	whole Dreamcast thing, says it's a scam, and gives me a link to the Neo GAF forums that
1094040	1097440	isn't loading for me right now, I'm timing out, so I can't read you the full text of
1097440	1101120	what it says, but apparently, that Dreamcast thing may not be legitimate.
1101120	1104120	Eh, who cares, I don't really care.
1104120	1106520	It's a fucking Dreamcast, what are they going to do with my serial number?
1106520	1109680	I guess that's true, what can they do with the serial number?
1109680	1113000	Besides maybe send spam, do you have to give me your email address?
1113000	1115800	I don't know, I haven't signed up, the site's down, so...
1115800	1118520	Well, maybe it got taken down for being a big scam!
1118520	1122160	No, there's an error thing, I think it's just too many people are trying to access it at
1122160	1124160	one time.
1124160	1126160	Alright.
1126160	1132320	Well, let's go ahead and get back into some gaming news.
1132320	1135640	Oh, actually, no, we're going to go and actually check out the mailbag.
1135640	1138720	Maybe I should pay attention to the schedule once in a while.
1138720	1139720	Maybe so.
1139720	1140720	Maybe I should.
1140720	1141720	Did we get a lot of emails this week?
1141720	1143440	I didn't see a lot in there earlier.
1143440	1144440	You know why?
1144440	1148360	Because Part B got screwed up, and that's where we had the mailbag last time, so I feel
1148360	1150280	very sorry for all those people who...
1150280	1152080	Oh, shoot, I moved all those emails out.
1152080	1153080	That's alright.
1153080	1154080	No, that's alright.
1154080	1155080	Just because I read them.
1155080	1156520	Yeah, because you read them last week, and technically they were on the show, they just
1156520	1160120	weren't on the podcast, which kind of sucks for those people, so we're very sorry.
1160120	1165920	You'll have to email us again, or look for The Lost Show or something, I don't know.
1165920	1169560	But regardless, we are going to open up the mailbag, because we did get at least a couple
1169560	1170560	emails, right?
1170560	1171560	A couple.
1171560	1175560	And that's enough for us to open up the mailbag and jump on in, so fill up the mailbag.
1175560	1177520	Give Jamie a lot of work to do next week.
1177520	1178520	Mailbag at orangelandarita.com.
1178520	1179520	Here we go.
1179520	1180520	My tongue.
1180520	1193000	The first email of the week is actually from Cheeseburger asking us to play the intro to
1193000	1198040	Castlevania 64.
1198040	1200680	Make me play the intro from a good game and we'll do it.
1200680	1206960	Uh, well, he actually emailed us, actually, no, I take that back, that wasn't from Cheeseburger,
1206960	1211960	it was from, god, now I have to go in that folder to find out who it was, because he
1211960	1217280	emailed us something else, but I can't read half of it on the air, because it involves
1217280	1221960	finding a broken DS and using their serial number to replace it, and we're not going
1221960	1222960	to do that.
1222960	1227360	We're not going to do that, I'm sorry.
1227360	1230680	Not after the debates we've been in the past couple weeks, I think maybe that email is
1230680	1231680	best unread.
1231680	1236880	But also, he's saying something about, do Koopa and Purin exist in Super Smash Bros.
1236880	1237880	Melee?
1237880	1243600	I think he means Brawl, basically, he was saying that if you change the language, Bowser
1243600	1249480	becomes Koopa and Jigglypuff becomes Purin, which were their original names, and then
1249480	1252360	you can save them that way?
1252360	1258860	I don't know what you mean, so, sorry, that's the only other email.
1258860	1266040	And by the way, that one that I lost was from somebody named Jake.
1266040	1267440	You lost an email?
1267440	1274960	No, it's, he didn't put a signature on there, the one that I mistakenly gave to Cheeseburger.
1274960	1275960	Oh.
1275960	1276960	So.
1276960	1277960	That's it?
1277960	1280440	We didn't get any, like, real email.
1280440	1281440	Weak.
1281440	1288320	Except some spam that I'm deleting right now that's titled LOL.
1288320	1291080	And Rob did it!
1291080	1292080	What's that?
1292080	1294080	It's titled LOL and you laughed.
1294080	1295080	LOL.
1295080	1296080	I did.
1296080	1297080	LOL.
1297080	1298080	Loss.
1298080	1299080	Weak mailbag.
1299080	1302800	I'm disappointed in all of you, but then again, I blame not having a Part B last week where
1302800	1308880	we actually had a mailbag to remind you that you can send us emails, so send us emails.
1308880	1310520	Are you a hardcore gamer?
1310520	1311520	Yes.
1311520	1313520	Have you downloaded the hardcore gamer pack yet?
1313520	1314520	No!
1314520	1315880	Well then you're not really a hardcore gamer.
1315880	1318160	Oh my god, how dare you!
1318160	1319160	Exactly.
1319160	1324520	On Xbox Live Marketplace, there is a brand new hardcore gamer picture pack, featuring
1324520	1331360	such wonderful pictures as Proud to be a Noob, Camper, Respawn, a little target symbol, and
1331360	1332360	T-Bag.
1332360	1333360	Yes, T-Bag.
1333360	1334360	Why?
1334360	1341960	If you really want to buy this, it's only $1.25 and yes, all people will know that you're
1341960	1346240	truly hardcore if you buy this and display them proudly.
1346240	1351720	Or I would like to point out that for free, you can download Community Gamer Picks, and
1351720	1355800	we're in pack number two of the Community Gamer Picks, and there's a little pick that
1355800	1360760	says OLR, and if you put that on your gamertag, at least we'll know you're hardcore, as will
1360760	1362320	all the rest of the OLR me.
1362320	1364960	So don't download this crap.
1364960	1365960	Don't pay for this.
1365960	1367960	Yeah, these look really stupid.
1367960	1370620	SSG100Matt sums up my thoughts exactly.
1370620	1373440	Why do they need to endorse stupidity that is T-Bagging?
1373440	1376720	I don't know, maybe we should ask disruptive media publishers.
1376720	1377720	I think we should!
1377720	1379480	Do we have a telephone number?
1379480	1381400	Let's call them right now, I'm sure they're there.
1381400	1384200	I don't know, let me get on that.
1384200	1388840	We'll send them an email maybe this week, we'll see.
1388840	1392440	Are you going to download the Hardcore Gamer Picks, Loki?
1392440	1394480	No, I'm doing it right now.
1394480	1396480	Oh wow.
1396480	1403480	Well, what's pretty hardcore as well is proposing to your significant other over a video game,
1403480	1404880	but do you know what's really hardcore?
1404880	1408400	I remember last year we had this story, I think we had a Viva Pinata story, we had an
1408400	1414440	Animal Crossing story, I want to say, and this time, this is kind of interesting, he
1414440	1422400	actually made a homebrew version of his significant other's favorite game, which was Bejeweled.
1422400	1426640	He made a homebrew version of this on the DS, and this guy Bernie, he's actually a user
1426640	1431800	on Zanga, what he did, he spent a few weeks actually making this Nintendo DS version of
1431800	1436680	Bejeweled completely from the ground up, and what happens is that once the game gets to
1436680	1442360	a certain score, the screen clears, and then what would happen is that a ring of the jewels
1442360	1446600	comes up on the screen, and what he did is that when his girlfriend was playing the game
1446600	1453580	and then got on the special screen, Bernie actually had a real ring there and proposed.
1453580	1457640	Everybody, awww.
1457640	1462740	Sorry, hairball.
1462740	1468900	But no, that is definitely dedication to build a game to propose to your significant other
1468900	1469900	with.
1469900	1473340	hardcore. So, good for you.
1473340	1474420	That is pretty cool.
1474420	1479220	I was just going to say, if you would like to email Disruptive Media Publishers and tell
1479220	1486220	them how crappy those hardcore gamer pics are, you can email them at info at disruptivepublishers.com.
1488820	1495820	Also have a mailing address on disruptivepublishers.com, so check it out. They're in Bellingham, Washington.
1495820	1501060	Ossifer in chat suggests, teabag your girlfriend for instant marriage.
1501060	1503860	They also have a Facebook community, too.
1503860	1504740	Let her know you're hardcore.
1504740	1508460	Because all the cool kids are on Facebook, man.
1508460	1515460	Teabagger. Right, DarkSakura? If Dan teabagged you in Halo, that's love, right?
1516580	1517700	My silence is my answer.
1517700	1521660	I'm getting blinked at. Perhaps we should move on, then.
1521660	1528660	Well, for anyone who's a fan of Undertow, there is an expansion out, but it costs. However,
1529300	1535500	it is only 200 Microsoft points, as opposed to 400, so if this is a boo-boo, go ahead
1535500	1537420	and get it, if you care.
1537420	1541660	Except I should point out the boo-boo has now been fixed. It's still 400 points now.
1541660	1544240	Aw, poor babies.
1544240	1552140	At any rate, though, there is some information on an expansion, Path of the Elect. It's five
1552140	1558460	levels, you have a new alien race called the Elect, wow, and four multiplayer maps, so
1558460	1563460	there's no other details than that. And, yeah, it's been fixed.
1563460	1568540	Huh. Well, it was free for, I mean, the game was free for a while, you know, to make up
1568540	1572780	for Xbox Live outages, although I'm not sure if that's really more of a punishment for
1572780	1576420	us or for, you know, thank you, I don't really...
1576420	1581580	I can't say I was an Undertow fan, but, you know, it's hard to bitch when something's
1581580	1587140	free. It's really hard to complain. Then again, I think about Totem Ball and Yaris, and there's
1587140	1593820	been some real shit free games on Xbox Live, but then, like, Age's Wing wasn't bad. It
1593820	1598060	wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. It was no Yaris, come on.
1598060	1605460	Yeah, so, I don't know. Yaris is unforgivable. I will never buy a Yaris because of that.
1605460	1607860	And, yeah, they suck.
1607860	1616180	So, there is a rumor that there's going to be a price cut coming for European Xbox 360s,
1616180	1620700	and apparently the price cut is supposed to happen on March 14th. It's going to be a price
1620700	1626940	cut of 50 Euros, and I guess we'll see if this actually happens. It's being reported
1626940	1635620	by TechRadar, and apparently they got the news of a new SKU. So, numerous well-placed
1635620	1641340	game industry sources, they said, have confirmed it. And that would bring a price, I guess,
1641340	1651420	of the 360 to 250 Euros for the arcade pack, and around 100 and... I'm sorry, 250 Euros
1651420	1660060	for the 360, and then the arcade would be 197 Euros. So, I don't know. Hopefully that
1660060	1662740	happens, but I guess we'll find out soon if that's the case.
1662740	1666940	Well, price cuts aren't a bad thing. I mean, I cannot think of a story where we've talked
1666940	1671820	about a price cut and it was a bad thing. So...
1671820	1672820	I'm thinking.
1672820	1676740	I know Loki, the devil's advocate here on the program, trying to think of something.
1676740	1681180	I'm sure there's the chat as well. Well, you think about that while I report on this. Other
1681180	1690100	worldly news, Asia is finally going to be getting Guitar Hero. And what's kind of interesting,
1690100	1693060	Blizzard is actually going to be helping the game actually come to Asia, because you know
1693060	1698020	how Activision just recently combined with Blizzard? Well, Blizzard has the institutional
1698020	1704300	expertise to bring Guitar Hero to places like China and Korea. And if you kind of think
1704300	1706380	about it, Blizzard did launch World of Warcraft.
1706380	1708300	I know how they're doing it.
1708300	1711460	They're going to have it where if you play the game well enough, you gain experience
1711460	1713540	in World of Warcraft on your account.
1713540	1721060	Who knows? Who knows? Apparently, the Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has also said this. He's
1721060	1726300	brought up the possibility of maybe putting other instruments in Guitar Hero, which would
1726300	1729180	be no surprise if you remember our story on DJ Hero's trademark last week.
1729180	1732700	I've got a totally great idea. This has never been attempted ever before. We're going to
1732700	1738280	put singing and drums in the game. And guess what? We also may put keyboards. Never been
1738280	1740580	done before on the face of the Earth. We are the first.
1740580	1743420	And then we're going to have a turntable and five to seven keys.
1743420	1747260	They need a Zither Hero.
1747260	1748260	I still want Satara Hero.
1748260	1751340	Where are our awards for originality and innovation?
1751340	1754060	Give me DigiRedo Hero. That's original.
1754060	1761740	Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
1761740	1763820	DigiRedo Hero would rock. And you know it.
1763820	1770500	Anyway, Clarinet Hero.
1770500	1776180	To continue on, though, with Guitar Hero information, for Guitar Hero 3, in time for St. Patrick's
1776180	1783500	Day, there is going to be a pack with stuff by Dropkick Murphys, which is pretty cool.
1783500	1789580	There will be Famous for Nothing, Flanagan's Ball, and Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya. So that's
1789580	1790860	pretty cool.
1790860	1795020	And also right now there's a modern metal pack out, though, that has some cool stuff
1795020	1797700	on it, too.
1797700	1800460	How very holiday appropriate.
1800460	1801460	That's an interesting...
1801460	1807780	I like Dropkick Murphys, but I like Flogging Molly better. And I would have gone with them.
1807780	1813900	So I was on YouTube looking for DigiRedo clips so I could, you know, hypothesize what DigiRedo
1813900	1820180	Hero might sound like. Keep in mind I've never heard this, but this says DigiRedo Techno.
1820180	1821180	This could be horrible.
1821180	1822180	It's pretty sweet, actually.
1822180	1823180	That's actually pretty fucking rad.
1823180	1824180	That is really cool.
1824180	1825180	Oh my god, this Aboriginal guy on the streets, this is live. He actually has a little techno
1825180	1826180	thing and he's playing the didgeridoo to this.
1826180	1827180	I'd buy that.
1827180	1853020	I would buy that in a heartbeat.
1853020	1855740	It's fucking sweet.
1855740	1856740	So hardcore.
1856740	1857740	That's awesome.
1857740	1858740	I like that song.
1858740	1862580	I am going to link that YouTube. Search for it. It's Didgeridoo Techno on YouTube.
1862580	1863580	That's pretty sweet.
1863580	1870140	If you know how to spell didgeridoo. D-I-D-G-E-R-I-D-O-O. I'm going to put that in my favorites on YouTube.
1870140	1874980	I think that was pretty rad. I'll actually put that in the OLR favorites right now. Check
1874980	1877020	that out. That's pretty awesome.
1877020	1885060	All right, sorry, we can go back to real gaming news now. I'll stop the didgeridoo.
1885060	1887540	I'm telling you, man, this guy needs to put out a fucking album.
1887540	1888540	Seriously.
1888540	1889540	That's sweet.
1889540	1893300	Look, we need to get him on the show. I want a new, I mean, with all due respect to Midi
1893300	1897900	Head and the great OLR theme he made us, he's an awesome guy. I do think it's time to maybe
1897900	1902700	get a fresh Orange Lounge Radio theme in here and I demand Didgeridoo in the theme.
1902700	1905540	And Auto Harp.
1905540	1906540	Somebody needs to make that happen.
1906540	1908980	That is fucking awesome.
1908980	1918180	All right. Orange Lounge Radio, wah, wah, wah, sky, dark, soccer, Loki, wah, wah, wah.
1918180	1921260	Anyway, sorry.
1921260	1922260	So, Loki, SingStar.
1922260	1924940	Sorry, I was so distracted by Didgeridoo stuff.
1924940	1930740	I know. It has that effect on people.
1930740	1935540	Even though we still haven't gotten it over here yet, there is a second PS3 SingStar on
1935540	1939540	the way. But, wait, why is there a second SingStar on the way? Because I thought there
1939540	1943380	was a whole SingStar with tons of songs that you can download from other SingStar games
1943380	1944380	already.
1944380	1950380	Well, apparently it's just going to be some new content, hopefully, but apparently Aussie
1950380	1955940	Retail Systems have noticed a new SKU for SingStar Volume 2, which is apparently due
1955940	1961740	in June. So, Australia may see another SingStar game, although we over here in the United
1961740	1964140	States are still waiting for the first SingStar game.
1964140	1966420	We actually have a clip of one of the new songs from SingStar.
1966420	1979980	Okay, I promise that's the last time.
1979980	1985940	The ESRB is taking a little heat this week because one of the ex-employees has come out
1985940	1990340	and really slammed the ESRB. The guy's name, Jerry Bonner, that's pretty brave to put
1990340	1992980	your name out there, by the way, when you do this kind of stuff.
1992980	1997780	He actually was working as a full-time rater person for the ESRB. He worked for six months,
1997780	2002580	and now he's come out as being critical of the way that the ESRB is doing its job. And
2002580	2006620	he actually came out and said these are some factors that need changing. He's complaining
2006620	2011980	that the ESRB needs to actually play the games at rates. Oh, snap, because you know, have
2011980	2016780	you heard that? That the ESRB actually, the publishers send information to the ESRB, they
2016780	2020940	don't always play the games. It's kind of, I swear that's how it works. It's very interesting.
2020940	2025660	I know they can't play it all the way through. Usually they get a clip or a video of like
2025660	2030380	gameplay footage that's, you know, supposed to be the most violent or, you know, obscene
2030380	2034600	stuff in the game. And then they make their ratings based on that.
2034600	2038780	Which is why, you know, things like Hot Coffee were so controversial, because that was omitted.
2038780	2042140	But I mean, we're not going to go over that whole thing again. But anyhow, here's the
2042140	2048320	other big thing. The guy also says that sequels are not judged on their own merits, but rather
2048320	2051100	the merits of the games before it.
2051100	2052460	Okay, that's stupid.
2052460	2057460	That is crazy. Here's some of the bullet points from what this guy suggests should be changed.
2057460	2063980	Drop the AO rating and add a new rating that's called T16, presumably for 16 years and up.
2063980	2068780	Play through the games all the way. Stop rating sequels according to the content and their
2068780	2077220	predecessors and be more open and don't be so secretive. And if it's true, that's going
2077220	2080980	to be a huge kick in the face, if like a lot of this is true.
2080980	2084100	Well, they've already come out and said, oh, well, blah, blah, blah. You know, we don't
2084100	2088820	support his views and all that stuff. And we're the ESRB. We're awesome. You know, that
2088820	2089820	kind of thing.
2089820	2093180	Those sound like fair requests to me, though. I don't know if it's just me, but it sounds
2093180	2096660	very fair to me. What do you think about those revelations, Dark Sakura? I mean, is this
2096660	2097660	going to...
2097660	2098660	Not at all surprised?
2098660	2104780	Yeah, but I mean, you know, we kind of rely on the ESRB as gamers when we kind of, you
2104780	2108380	know, when these games come out and all these horrible things happen. Like, take the butt
2108380	2113380	story from Burnout earlier. We go, well, the ESRB did say the rating is subject to change.
2113380	2118500	But if the ESRB gets discredited with stuff like this, this really screws us in a way.
2118500	2121580	I don't know. It's kind of sad.
2121580	2125780	It's a... I honestly think it's a sort of a corrupt institution anyway.
2125780	2130260	Ross Steele UT has said that Patricia Vance has already come out and denied it. Well,
2130260	2133460	that seems like a given, though. So, I mean, it is kind of a qua... You know, obviously
2133460	2138380	take it as a rumor for now, but it certainly is a question. I have heard from, you know,
2138380	2142720	inside folks, and I'm pretty sure it's out there on the internet also, that ESRB doesn't
2142720	2148300	necessarily play through the games. They will rate based on stuff that you send them. So,
2148300	2153460	kind of interesting. And I remember overhearing at a trade show once about people, and I think
2153460	2155940	you were there too, Loki. I don't know if you ever heard this same conversation, but
2155940	2162080	about how a particular game I'm thinking of, a particular game with... I don't even want
2162080	2165460	to say, because I don't want people to speculate, but a particular game, I heard the two developers
2165460	2170960	kind of... The developer joking with another really big industry press person about how
2170960	2176300	they got this through the ESRB with a particular rating. I just was kind of shocked to hear
2176300	2181300	that kind of talk. So, interesting. Anyhow.
2181300	2188700	Well, there... You know, just to move away from the ESRB and how crappy they are.
2188700	2189700	Let's.
2189700	2193820	Yes. Skype is actually coming out on Japanese PSPs this month.
2193820	2194820	Woohoo!
2194820	2203260	So, it will be on March 18th, and it's only, of course, for the slim PSP, the newer one,
2203260	2210700	and it's supposed to be a month later over here in the US. Also, the microphone attachment
2210700	2214700	is going to be 2,500 yen, or two for 4,000.
2214700	2215700	Hmm.
2215700	2217420	So, that's not bad.
2217420	2219420	Not bad at all.
2219420	2224500	I'm glad that Japanese PSP users will get to use this. Good call.
2224500	2227580	And then we'll be able to do it a month later.
2227580	2232020	We already have it. We got our first call last week on the Skype line from a Skype PSP
2232020	2233020	user.
2233020	2234020	Huh.
2234020	2240980	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is going to be due out here next month, and they have released
2240980	2247940	the full list of cars and tracks that are going to be included in that. Tons of different
2247940	2258180	stuff you can pick from, I believe, was it, I want to say like 65 cars and 6 tracks, including
2258180	2267120	the Suzuka Circuit, the Eiger Nordwand, Fuji Speedway, London City Track, Daytona International
2267120	2272420	Speedway, and the High Speed Ring, and a bunch of different cars. I don't even know what
2272420	2277920	to even cover on that, but lots of stuff to keep you satisfied until the full game comes
2277920	2278920	out.
2278920	2283980	Also, it's going to have a brand new drift mode for the US version, as well as the ability
2283980	2290980	to fine tune your car, and two player split screen racing, and I guess a new set of events.
2290980	2295660	Not bad for 40 bucks.
2295660	2298860	So that's not just Prologue, that's the full game, right?
2298860	2299860	No, that's Prologue.
2299860	2301340	Oh, that's just Prologue.
2301340	2302340	Yeah.
2302340	2307500	Okay. What was I going to say? Seems a little weak for the full game. Alright. That's cool.
2307500	2313820	Well, if racing isn't your thing, maybe cheering is. Yay! There is a new cheering game coming
2313820	2318340	out for the Wii and the DS. It's called All Star Cheer Squad, and it's coming to you from
2318340	2324100	THQ. It's going to be again for the Wii and the DS, and if you're on the Wii, get this,
2324100	2329200	you get to use the balance board. So you won't just be cheering with your, you can cheer
2329200	2333300	with your feet and everything. Won't this be fun?
2333300	2338820	And here's the thing, the game is actually, just to give it authenticity, it's choreographed
2338820	2345660	by Tony Gee, who also choreographed the movie Bring It On. So that actually, you know, I
2345660	2353020	have to admit, it actually sounds kind of fun. Doesn't the All Star Cheer Squad sound
2353020	2355420	just slightly fun, Dark Sakura?
2355420	2356420	Slightly.
2356420	2357420	Like to play once?
2357420	2362540	It sounds as much fun as going to the dentist. Although my dentist is pretty cool.
2362540	2367340	Do you know how much money I would pay for a YouTube of Loki playing All Star Cheer Squad?
2367340	2370260	There's no money in the world.
2370260	2375580	Maybe that'll be the next bet. Whenever we find another bet for Loki to take on, we'll
2375580	2382340	get him to play All Star Cheer Squad in the Tingle outfit.
2382340	2387100	We need to make this happen somehow. We will be opening the Skype line after this next
2387100	2393740	story. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Go ahead and give
2393740	2397020	us a call after this story.
2397020	2405220	Well, for people who were fans of the Castlevania series and collect action figures, it doesn't
2405220	2414060	look like we're going to really be getting the new figures that they were discussing.
2414060	2421300	I mean, basically, they were asked if there were going to be any more in that Castlevania
2421300	2428460	line and it was reported that there were no plans at all and no news on Castlevania figures
2428460	2432980	and that they will not be revisiting the license.
2432980	2434380	Well that's kind of a bummer.
2434380	2436340	I want a Richter figure, dang it.
2436340	2437340	Richter.
2437340	2442900	If you're going to say it, you have to say it right.
2442900	2449020	Skype line is open. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. While we're
2449020	2451620	waiting for some calls, how about some last minute stories? Do you have anything for us
2451620	2452620	tonight, Loki?
2452620	2457620	Actually, I don't.
2457620	2460180	What? We've actually covered everything?
2460180	2463540	Well, I mean, I'm sure there's some other stuff.
2463540	2468180	Well, thank God a call's coming in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
2468180	2474020	Hi, this is Ross Steel UT. Let me turn the speakers down. Sorry about that.
2474020	2477460	No, that's all right. What's on your mind, Ross Steel UT?
2477460	2484020	Not much. I want to talk about the whole thing with the guy whose 360 got wiped clean.
2484020	2489660	Yeah, and then Bungie actually had to fix it and all that stuff. What's your thoughts
2489660	2490660	on that?
2490660	2495900	Well, much love to Bungie, but where the fuck is Microsoft? They said they were going to
2495900	2500500	help the guy, and then we haven't heard from them since.
2500500	2504500	But isn't Bungie like it? No, because they split. I keep wanting to say, oh, but Bungie
2504500	2505500	is a person.
2505500	2510580	Well, they split, but it still wasn't Bungie's fault. That's the thing. This isn't some sort
2510580	2516180	of little casual accident, because from what I understand, the console was marked as permanent
2516180	2523620	marker. Whoever did this had to really get in there, you know what I mean?
2523620	2529460	I always thought that they just gave the console a different shell, but I guess it was actually
2529460	2530460	real.
2530460	2541580	Actually, if you go to Hard and McBloggy, let me put a link. They show a picture of the
2541580	2548700	console in question, and you'll still see a few little smudge marks. So that is the
2548700	2553860	console. They just got to work cleaning it off.
2553860	2554860	That is so weird.
2554860	2559820	I think they all go through some sort of power wash.
2559820	2561580	Like a high pressure wash.
2561580	2564500	Oh, to make your Xbox look new again?
2564500	2565500	Yeah.
2565500	2566500	Basically, yeah.
2566500	2572700	That's interesting. I wonder if... Oh, my gosh. Oh, yeah, and you can see. Oh, thanks
2572700	2575700	for the link to the blog. That's interesting. You can totally see how some of the ink is
2575700	2581860	just rubbed off. So that's how you might put your ring or something. I'm thinking last
2581860	2585860	weekend I watched my friend get her engagement ring washed, and they have a machine that
2585860	2589980	does it, make it look new again. It's kind of that type of thing. Make your Xbox 360
2589980	2590980	look new again.
2590980	2591980	That's weird.
2591980	2598300	Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm not surprised by Microsoft having incompetent
2598300	2606860	tech support. I had my 360 sent in early November, and I got a refurb, and it took me four
2606860	2612740	months to finally get my XBLA games revalidated to the console. Needless to say, I'm never
2612740	2614300	buying anything off the marketplace again.
2614300	2620520	That is a big mess. When I sent my Xbox 360 back, thankfully, I only had two arcade games
2620520	2624160	purchased at the time, and they're not ones I play super... Well, I take that back. Joust
2624160	2627980	was one. I haven't played that in a while, but Geometry Wars was the other. Thankfully,
2627980	2631860	I haven't had much issues, because since it is tied to your Xbox Live name, it recognizes
2631860	2636220	me and all that stuff, and it lets me play the full version, but I do have to wait a
2636220	2639500	couple seconds. Obviously, I'm not going to get frustrated over a couple seconds, but
2639500	2643300	I'm just thinking I've heard of other people who've lost a lot more than two arcade games,
2643300	2644300	and it's just a pain in the ass.
2644300	2654700	Well, the problem with XBLA is that you cannot play your stuff offline if you do a refurb.
2654700	2658740	You have to be online at all times. A couple of days ago, my internet was on the first
2658740	2663780	time I couldn't do that, so there goes Geometry Wars, there goes Symphony of the Night, Contra,
2663780	2664780	a few others.
2664780	2668940	Is this true? Darktitsuya points out that this isn't just a Microsoft thing. He says
2668940	2673460	in chat, it's the same with Virtual Console. When I got my Wii back, I had to redownload
2673460	2676460	them, but they didn't cost extra. They were free to replace. Well, that's not so bad.
2676460	2677580	At least it worked, then.
2677580	2681140	Well, yeah. At least you can use them without being online. That's the important thing.
2681140	2682140	I guess that's true.
2682140	2689540	I mean, if I got to download it again, sure, whatever. But this just struck me as an especially
2689540	2694380	evil thing to do to somebody, because there's no reason to do that, especially as the guy
2694380	2697940	said, hey, I don't want my thing cleaned.
2697940	2704440	I would understand. If Microsoft did this whole power wash thing, I could understand
2704440	2708480	how they might miss the special request and just everything goes on the assembly line.
2708480	2712920	They don't pay really any attention to it. It's fix, line, fix. But I think Microsoft
2712920	2716580	should at least come out and let us know publicly that that's what happened, like I do.
2716580	2721420	Because Microsoft is so out there in the community. They worked really hard. They have, what,
2721420	2726540	Gamerscore Blog, Major Nelson, and all these people. I'm sure these people are aware of
2726540	2731540	this negative story being out there on the blog. So I really think Microsoft will say
2731540	2734620	something about it eventually and kind of admit, oops, my bad.
2734620	2740340	The problem is that Microsoft, for everything they do in the community, there's a million
2740340	2746180	horror stories. There's the alarming amount of red rings. There's the nightmare with getting
2746180	2751740	your stuff validated on your console so you can use it offline again. And then there's
2751740	2757440	this. It really makes you wonder if the left hand even knows what the right hand is doing.
2757440	2759660	What do you want to bet, though? I mean, all that aside, what do you want to bet, though,
2759660	2763660	the reason why Bungie did this for this guy is that somebody at Microsoft saw this story
2763660	2766300	on the blogs, their community outreach people, and made a phone call.
2766300	2770540	Oh, I'm sure they were like, yeah, could you help us out here?
2770540	2777100	Yeah, exactly. We fucked up. Can you save our ass? It happens. It happens.
2777100	2787860	Anyway, on better Microsoft news, the Financial Times is reporting that Microsoft might be
2787860	2792300	considering more Blu-ray support. Some people have even speculated a Blu-ray draw for the
2792300	2793300	360.
2793300	2796980	I have heard about that, that Microsoft is supposedly in talks with Sony about the whole
2796980	2801900	Blu-ray add-on, which is a very strange kind of marriage, but I guess one step that Microsoft
2801900	2803900	might have to make at this point.
2803900	2806060	Well, might have to make. They do have to make.
2806060	2807060	Well, do they?
2807060	2814100	You have to understand the majority of people on a console at the end aren't going to be
2814100	2818540	online, so you're going to have to have the sort of offline option.
2818540	2820020	How come the Wii doesn't have to do it?
2820020	2827940	Because the Wii is not being marketed as a media center. We've had this conversation
2827940	2834900	before. It's being marketed on, oh, look at the cute little novelty controller.
2834900	2842220	As you start adding in the forecast channel, the news channel, the TV Guide channel, all
2842220	2847680	this other stuff, it's a different type of center of sorts.
2847680	2856420	I don't know. I just don't see the marketing in the sort of multimedia center of the home
2856420	2858140	thing.
2858140	2864020	I agree with Frisbee. I don't need it to be, but it's also Microsoft.
2864020	2870140	The only thing that might stop this is that Microsoft doesn't want to be seen as admitting
2870140	2876500	picking a losing side, that they pretty much had to give away those HD DVD add-ons, which
2876500	2877500	I thought was funny.
2877500	2881580	You know what? I've got to wrap up so we can get some other calls, but here's the thing.
2881580	2885220	I would kind of close on this. I would bet that Microsoft doesn't end up doing it, and
2885220	2886820	they'll just build it into their next system.
2886820	2894540	That's my guess. I mean, I would imagine both the 720 and the PS4 would be Blu-ray.
2894540	2898940	Right. Well, we're probably years off from both, but I think you're right. I think if
2898940	2902460	they do talk to them about Blu-ray, I think it'll wait until the next Xbox system.
2902460	2908140	We've got to let you go, Rasteel, because we've got to get some other calls, but thanks
2908140	2909820	so much for your call. Have a good one.
2909820	2910820	All right. Have a good one.
2910820	2911820	Take care, buddy.
2911820	2912820	Bye.
2912820	2918740	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. That
2918740	2920940	call was seven minutes. I tried to limit him to about four.
2920940	2922820	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
2922820	2925860	Yo, it's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest. How you doing?
2925860	2929380	Xenocore from Ultimate Quest. How are things doing on the Ultimate Quest, Xenocore?
2929380	2934940	Well, we've been sort of hectic considering we've been on and off on our weekends, mainly
2934940	2940500	because I went to Megacon this last weekend up in Orlando. Yeah, doing a little bit of
2940500	2945940	coverage here and there. My first one, actually, had just popped my contrary on Megacon.
2945940	2950500	Check that out. What's the website again for folks who want to check out that?
2950500	2953100	Well, for the convention or for our show?
2953100	2954100	For the show.
2954100	2959980	Oh, well, the show is at UltimateQuest.net. You may hear about something on it last week
2959980	2965400	since I missed a recording. I didn't get back till late this evening. But, yeah, man, Megacon
2965400	2967140	was something else, my goodness.
2967140	2969740	Is that what you called in to talk about tonight was Megacon? What's up?
2969740	2974180	Well, yeah, I mean, on top of that, they had the first Smash Brothers tournament I happened
2974180	2980820	to catch, which is kind of interesting. But, yeah, the cosplayers, man, I wasn't ready
2980820	2982700	for that level of dedication at all.
2982700	2987660	Dude, there's some cosplayers that are so good at what they do. It is astounding. That's
2987660	2991060	love right there. What were some of the cool cosplays you saw, Xenocore?
2991060	2997140	Well, I got to mention this one that stood out for everything. A 14-year-old girl doing
2997140	3003460	the Mighty Edward from Cowboy Bebop in character all three days. Laptop on her head the entire
3003460	3004460	time.
3004460	3005460	Wow.
3005460	3006460	It was impressive. Yeah.
3006460	3009580	I thought I was cool when I went as a black mage, even though I borrowed the costume from
3009580	3011580	Rama.
3011580	3014620	I got a question for you about role-playing games.
3014620	3015620	Already?
3015620	3019740	Have you played Lost Odyssey?
3019740	3024940	We on our show did not. Henderson, man, actually spoke up for the show to review that one.
3024940	3026660	I haven't grabbed it yet.
3026660	3030740	I'm just kind of curious, because I know you guys kind of specialize in the role-playing
3030740	3034260	games. I'm kind of curious, and maybe I'll have to wait until you guys take a few trips.
3034260	3037980	I'm kind of curious of your general thoughts on the game, because the critics overall kind
3037980	3043980	of dogged it a little bit, but I'm in love with it. I think it's a fantastic game.
3043980	3047940	The main thing that caught my attention is something Henderson mentioned. You can't outlevel
3047940	3053900	the bosses in Lost Odyssey. The bosses level according to what level you are, so the bosses
3053900	3054900	are always different.
3054900	3057260	Not really. No wonder there's such pains in the ass.
3057260	3059940	Not really. They don't level, as far as I'm aware.
3059940	3060940	They don't level?
3060940	3065500	No, because there's actually some guides out there, the Prima guides and stuff, that tell
3065500	3069500	you what level you should be at to play the boss. If you would have to grind a little
3069500	3071860	bit, you can't just go from one boss to the next.
3071860	3076660	Is it maybe because even though the bosses level up, you get more skills, so it makes
3076660	3081500	it easier regardless? That could be my thought, is that maybe, yeah, the bosses are leveling
3081500	3086180	up, but since you get more skills, you get power on them that way, if that makes sense.
3086180	3090580	Because a large part of the game is skills.
3090580	3094660	Everything I've gotten so far is based on Henderson Man's review.
3094660	3099140	I will be playing it myself sooner or later as soon as the budget allows for it, but until
3099140	3101460	then I can only go by word of mouth, pretty much.
3101460	3105540	Well, I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Xenocore. I just had to ask, because it's
3105540	3109900	been a large part of my gaming time lately. What else did you call in to talk about it?
3109900	3110900	Anything else?
3110900	3114600	Well, mainly it was just that, that I happened to come across my first con and decided to
3114600	3117620	share it with some fellow con lovers.
3117620	3121260	It's been a while since I've been to a con, but definitely we have Fandame coming up in
3121260	3125100	May or June, right? When's Fandame? Is it Memorial Day weekend, Fandame?
3125100	3126100	I think it is.
3126100	3128780	Yeah, but I'm probably not going this year.
3128780	3136220	Oh, is it the same time as your road trip? Oh. Oh. So, oh, well that's a bummer, because
3136220	3141660	we always do our show there. But, let's see, well there's other cons coming up, and I still
3141660	3143940	want to go to that one in Chicago, ASIN, is that it?
3143940	3145660	I really want to go to ASIN.
3145660	3147060	We'll see, we'll see.
3147060	3150220	And I have information on that too, later.
3150220	3152940	Okay. Later then. Later it is.
3152940	3155860	Xenocore, anything else before I let you go?
3155860	3160740	Just pretty much that, that and the largest Yuri Yowie argument I've ever heard in my
3160740	3161740	entire life.
3161740	3162740	No, jeez.
3162740	3164480	Other than that, that was fine.
3164480	3166180	Some things you can never escape, but cons.
3166180	3169820	All right, let's go to YowieCon, the whole thing is an argument.
3169820	3174260	All right, well Xenocore, thanks so much for your call, and have a good one, and good luck
3174260	3175260	with your own show, all right?
3175260	3176820	All right, take it easy, guys.
3176820	3178720	You too, bye-bye.
3178720	3180500	What exactly is the Yuri Yowie argument?
3180500	3182620	Well, hold on, I'm going to ask our next caller.
3182620	3184300	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio, who's this?
3184300	3187300	Hey, I'm the family jam sessions, what's up?
3187300	3188300	I don't care who it is.
3188300	3193420	I want to ask you, DJ Rom S, I want to ask you, what is the Yuri Yowie argument?
3193420	3198580	Oh, man.
3198580	3201660	What exactly is the Yuri Yowie argument?
3201660	3206680	You got these fangirls who argue about what's better, Yuri or Yowie.
3206680	3211340	They run around with these paddles, they will start smacking you with them if you do not
3211340	3213460	agree with them.
3213460	3219500	This is true, that's why I said going to YowieCon is like a whole argument in and of itself.
3219500	3225260	My friend, my other friend Jasmine, she has this priestess outfit, she walks around with
3225260	3230540	an anti-Yowie paper fan that she smacks people with.
3230540	3235300	That is nothing short of amazing, I don't know how else to describe it, but they yell
3235300	3239100	at each other, this sounds like stupid fun, but they actually get upset over this.
3239100	3244700	They really do think they're going to beat it into you to like Yowie.
3244700	3249900	Some of them do, I mean a couple of years back at Animazement, we had this line of people
3249900	3255420	on one side, you had the ninjas, you had on the other side the pirates, we were shouting
3255420	3259180	back and forth, ninjas were better or pirates were better, got to the point where staff
3259180	3264340	had to break us all up, and then maybe about an hour later, we started a conga line singing
3264340	3267780	ninja rap all throughout the entire convention area.
3267780	3271520	Cons are so weird.
3271520	3274780	The funny thing about Anime Expo every year is that wherever they schedule it, they also
3274780	3280460	schedule some sort of religious convention, so you get the people preaching to the cosplayers
3280460	3288400	in line, and one year a bunch of us just started completely telling them off in various other
3288400	3291920	languages that weren't necessarily Japanese.
3291920	3296220	I know a lot of people that would pay a lot of money to see women beat each other up with
3296220	3297220	battles.
3297220	3301820	So you can get this all for free at your local anime convention?
3301820	3306820	Pretty much, and Jamie, there is a voice actor, his name is Vic, he's like a born-again Christian,
3306820	3313180	he's the voice of Ed from FMA, at Anime Conza, he has like a panel of Sunday morning service
3313180	3316900	for con-goers to come and arrive for service.
3316900	3319180	That's kinda cool.
3319180	3320180	That's kinda neat.
3320180	3322140	I've seen that happen at various conventions.
3322140	3324580	For people that want to do that, why not?
3324580	3325580	Why not?
3325580	3326580	Definitely.
3326580	3333300	Here's another quote that I love from RossioUT in chat, it says, this is different from console
3333300	3334300	fanboys.
3334300	3335300	How?
3335300	3336300	Xbox!
3336300	3337300	PlayStation!
3337300	3338300	Xbox!
3338300	3339300	PlayStation!
3339300	3340300	Wii!
3340300	3345540	I don't know about you guys, but I'd rather see a bunch of girls in cute outfits screaming
3345540	3350460	yaoi vs yuri than a bunch of fanboys shouting what console is better, you know?
3350460	3352260	I'd have to agree with you there.
3352260	3353260	Yeah.
3353260	3357100	Alright, Rama, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
3357100	3358100	A couple of things.
3358100	3359100	Yeah.
3359100	3362960	The 360 with the missing autographs, if it was me, I would have bit the bullet and bought
3362960	3364380	a new console.
3364380	3365380	What?
3365380	3367260	I would have done the same thing.
3367260	3370340	Yeah, that's exactly what I would have done.
3370340	3374740	But even, but they gave him back, the problem wasn't that he didn't have a working console,
3374740	3375740	I don't get it.
3375740	3376900	I wouldn't have left that to fate.
3376900	3381300	I would not have put something that valuable in the hands of other people.
3381300	3382300	I get it.
3382300	3383300	I get it.
3383300	3385500	So you would never have sent the console in to be repaired in the first place?
3385500	3386500	Exactly.
3386500	3387500	Okay, okay.
3387500	3389500	That's fair.
3389500	3390500	And Rob?
3390500	3391500	Yep.
3391500	3394540	I used to be a member of Prodigy as well.
3394540	3395540	What was your username?
3395540	3397500	Do you remember?
3397500	3401180	I think it was Ronmecoon76 or something like that.
3401180	3402180	That's not old school.
3402180	3403180	That's not old school.
3403180	3405900	You don't have the random letters and numbers?
3405900	3411020	No, no, no, see, I got into Prodigy during the age of Windows and stuff like that.
3411020	3412020	Oh, no, no, no, no.
3412020	3413020	That's what I got on.
3413020	3414020	Oh, no, no, no.
3414020	3415020	I had Prodigy.
3415020	3416020	You go way old school, yeah.
3416020	3421100	I had DOS-based Prodigy, HWPD42B.
3421100	3425620	I remember Radio Shack stores had Prodigy set up for people who were free to try out
3425620	3426620	and stuff.
3426620	3427620	Yep.
3427620	3429660	That's how we found out about it the first time.
3429660	3432780	And you know what happened to Prodigy, right?
3432780	3437020	Then they get absolved into, basically they're like an ISP now, aren't they?
3437020	3439660	Or they're a part of Yahoo, aren't they?
3439660	3440660	Not really.
3440660	3443160	They're like the red-headed bastard stepchild of AT&T.
3443160	3447300	Like about one or two years ago, they were trying to sell off the name and everybody,
3447300	3450380	the whole thing, to the highest bidder, and they're still trying to do that.
3450380	3454180	Well, they got their asses handed to them by AOL, which is kind of sad because Prodigy
3454180	3458580	was really rad for a couple of years when they were the only ones that had that DOS
3458580	3459580	thing.
3459580	3460580	That was awesome.
3460580	3461580	That's awesome.
3461580	3462580	Yeah.
3462580	3463580	That's awesome.
3463580	3465180	All right, DJ Romans, we got to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.
3465180	3466180	It's fun as always.
3466180	3467180	One more thing.
3467180	3468180	One more thing.
3468180	3469180	I promise I'm not here.
3469180	3470180	Hurry.
3470180	3471940	You'll never guess what my first game console was.
3471940	3472940	What?
3472940	3475260	ColecoVision Adam.
3475260	3477780	Which is ironic if people know you very well.
3477780	3478780	Mm-hmm.
3478780	3481820	I'll see you guys later.
3481820	3482820	Take care, Rama.
3482820	3483820	All right.
3483820	3484820	Bye.
3484820	3485820	Or should I say ColecoVision?
3485820	3486820	All right.
3486820	3487820	ColecoMan!
3487820	3491820	If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call.
3491820	3492820	Maristia2877 specialize.
3492820	3493820	My name's Maristia2877.
3493820	3494820	Our user name on Skype is OrangeloungeRadio.
3494820	3501140	Meanwhile, I did actually get a last-minute news story from somebody.
3501140	3503460	Where is it?
3503460	3504480	Here it is.
3504480	3509460	Is the video game industry recession-proof, a story that was run on MSN?
3509460	3514700	Video game companies think that they might be able to survive the slowing down of the
3514700	3515700	economy.
3515700	3523260	Apparently, video games have defied the sagging retail sales figures of December 2007.
3523260	3527620	Nintendo actually talked to CNBC, specifically Reggie Fils-Aime, said that his company in
3527620	3532140	particular was weathering the coming storm and that video games seem to do well in tougher
3532140	3533140	economic times.
3533140	3536260	Well, come on, if you're a Nintendo Wii right now, you're one of the few people that's doing
3536260	3538700	very well, right?
3538700	3541940	It's interesting, his MSNBC story kind of gets into talking about the history and all
3541940	3545260	this other stuff as well, so check that out if you want to.
3545260	3546260	Meantime, we have another call.
3546260	3550220	I was going to say I have a couple of last-minute stories after this.
3550220	3551340	We'll get to those right after this call.
3551340	3553260	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio, who's this?
3553260	3555780	Hi, this is Ospurr.
3555780	3557260	Ospurr, what's on your mind?
3557260	3559500	I always horribly mispronounce your name, apparently.
3559500	3564260	I always say Ospurr like I'm drunk talking to the policeman, but it's Ospurr.
3564260	3565580	It's Ospurr, so my bad.
3565580	3567220	So what's on your mind, Ospurr?
3567220	3569100	That's all right.
3569100	3573860	It's just pretty interesting with the whole yaoi-yuri argument, and I'm actually going
3573860	3578460	to be going to my first convention in May, so I'll be sure to look out for that.
3578460	3582260	You know what, yeah, just avoid the women that have the yaoi-yuri paddles unless you're
3582260	3583260	into that.
3583260	3584260	Watch out for the free hugs.
3584260	3585260	You don't know if they've been tested.
3585260	3590980	Yeah, if somebody's wearing a glomp sign, run the other way.
3590980	3594380	I want to experience full on, so I'm actually going to go run towards them for the heck
3594380	3595380	of it.
3595380	3597620	Okay, don't say we didn't warn you, bud.
3597620	3601420	Rama wants to know what con it is.
3601420	3604020	I think it's Anime Central.
3604020	3605020	It's in Illinois.
3605020	3606020	That's ASEN.
3606020	3607260	That's the one that we're wanting to go to.
3607260	3609020	Yeah, we're thinking about going.
3609020	3610340	That's a big one.
3610340	3611740	Oh, that's pretty cool.
3611740	3612740	Yeah.
3612740	3613740	We'll see.
3613740	3614740	I don't know.
3614740	3615740	It's probably too late to get a panel on that and all that stuff.
3615740	3616740	We'll see.
3616740	3617740	Not necessarily.
3617740	3618740	Hmm.
3618740	3619740	Maybe we might have to make that happen.
3619740	3622180	If not, we could always do the OLR hospitality suite or something silly.
3622180	3623180	I don't know.
3623180	3624180	We'll think of something.
3624180	3625180	Yeah.
3625180	3626940	Yeah, we're still plotting.
3626940	3627940	I don't know.
3627940	3631180	If it doesn't happen this year, then for sure next year, because we definitely want to make
3631180	3632180	ASEN a goal of ours.
3632180	3635700	We know we have a lot of folks in the Midwest that want to meet us, and I want to meet them.
3635700	3636700	So we'll see.
3636700	3637700	We'll see.
3637700	3638700	Well, good luck at that con.
3638700	3643300	Anything else you wanted to talk to us about tonight?
3643300	3646180	Just been playing lots of Brawl.
3646180	3647180	What are your thoughts on Brawl?
3647180	3648180	Did they get it right?
3648180	3649180	Was it worth the wait?
3649180	3655640	Yeah, I'd say it's definitely worth the wait, but really my only frustration is with the
3655640	3656640	online play.
3656640	3661060	So I just can't freaking connect and play against anyone.
3661060	3663780	Is your Wii far away from your Wi-Fi router?
3663780	3668180	No, it's only like 10 feet away from it.
3668180	3669180	Oh, weird.
3669180	3671220	You know, I did play online.
3671220	3672540	I haven't gotten the friends thing to work.
3672540	3675220	I'm going to try tonight after the show.
3675220	3680180	But I have heard, or I did play the random people one, which is a little silly because
3680180	3683940	it's just like playing the computer pretty much, except you know somebody real is controlling
3683940	3684940	it.
3684940	3685940	But it wasn't bad.
3685940	3688860	It was relatively lag-free, so I was pretty excited.
3688860	3695940	Oh yeah, I just kept on getting error codes and it would just cut me out saying the transmission
3695940	3697340	has ended or something like that.
3697340	3698960	I was just like, what the heck?
3698960	3701940	But I haven't actually tried doing it through friend codes, so I don't know, maybe that'll
3701940	3702940	work better.
3702940	3703940	Who knows?
3703940	3706180	All right, well anything else on your mind tonight, Ospher?
3706180	3707820	No, that's about it.
3707820	3710700	All right, well thanks so much for the phone call.
3710700	3716100	You have a good week, and try to take that Smash Brothers in limitation.
3716100	3717500	Don't OD on it, okay?
3717500	3718500	Yeah.
3718500	3719500	Okay.
3719500	3720500	Take care, buddy.
3720500	3721500	All right, see ya.
3721500	3722500	All right.
3722500	3724060	That's going to do it for tonight's Skypline.
3724060	3727140	Thank you guys so much for your calls, and if you didn't get through tonight, don't worry,
3727140	3728260	there's always next week.
3728260	3730300	Or you can always leave us a voicemail.
3730300	3732300	We do play the voicemails once in a while.
3732300	3735260	I know we didn't play them tonight, but we'll probably get to some more next week.
3735260	3738580	1-877-GAME-OLR whenever we're not live.
3738580	3740780	So you said you had some last minute stories, Lucky?
3740780	3742780	Yes, real quick here.
3742780	3745020	There's two things.
3745020	3751620	At show Dexter, you may have heard about, they're actually now starting to replay it
3751620	3760660	on CVS, but it's about a serial killer who, instead of going around killing other people,
3760660	3762820	he goes around killing serial killers.
3762820	3765260	So they kind of fight his urge.
3765260	3769640	It's currently running Showtime, and apparently they're making a game from it.
3769640	3771780	So that's kind of interesting.
3771780	3774820	The other thing is the game Turning Point.
3774820	3781220	Apparently the reviews haven't been too good for it, and according to Turning Point's CEO
3781220	3788420	of the company Spark Unlimited, he's quoted that Turning Point is too high concept for
3788420	3791460	reviewers.
3791460	3794920	It wasn't for the critics, apparently.
3794920	3803380	It was more, I guess, a game that was never meant for core gamers, or is meant for those
3803380	3808360	who aren't wanting to look at a game with a critical eye, I guess.
3808360	3814360	So he's basically saying that the game reviewers don't know how to review his game, because
3814360	3817160	it was supposed to be crappy, I guess.
3817160	3819160	I don't know.
3819160	3821660	All right.
3821660	3825680	I know his next game that they're doing, was it Legendary?
3825680	3827420	That one that's by Gamecock, I guess?
3827420	3828420	Legendary the Box?
3828420	3832420	But now it's just Legendary.
3832420	3835220	Who knows?
3835220	3837420	All right.
3837420	3840760	Well that is going to do it, I guess, for tonight's Last Minute Stories.
3840760	3841760	That's it for now.
3841760	3842760	All right.
3842760	3845940	So that's going to bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
3845940	3849380	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting independent radio.
3849380	3850440	You guys are awesome.
3850440	3855060	I want to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts, and then actually we're breaking
3855060	3856060	form a little bit tonight.
3856060	3859540	I have one more story that's very important that we want to do at the very, very end.
3859540	3863820	We're going to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts, Loki.
3863820	3869700	My final thought is I want to finish Space Emissary Mode this week, and god damn it,
3869700	3875140	I wish my 360, the other one I'm fixing, fucking works, because it's three-ringed and been
3875140	3879740	fixed and three-ringed and sort of been fixed for weeks now.
3879740	3883700	Now it's three-ringed right now, so I have to heat it up again, and I think it's just
3883700	3884700	broken.
3884700	3888500	But I've done so many mods to it that I kind of want it to be fixed, because it'll look
3888500	3890300	like a Frankenstein's monster when I'm done.
3890300	3893540	This is a long-ass final thought.
3893540	3895300	It's a final muse.
3895300	3896740	It's a final rant.
3896740	3899180	I'm just messing with you, Loki.
3899180	3900980	This show just wouldn't be the same without you.
3900980	3902700	You know it.
3902700	3905720	My final thought is I cannot wait for Wii Fit.
3905720	3906720	I really can't.
3906720	3908540	I think it's going to be very interesting.
3908540	3910280	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
3910280	3913260	Say no to bullshit.
3913260	3914260	Really good final thought.
3914260	3916200	Appreciate that.
3916200	3919760	We are going to close tonight on this, and I hate to end the show on such a downer, but
3919760	3925580	it is very important to acknowledge, and I'm sure if you have an internet connection, you've
3925580	3930200	heard about it this week, we have to acknowledge the passing of Gary Gygax, which happened
3930200	3931560	this week.
3931560	3934940	You might not know the name, but you definitely know the legacy he left behind.
3934940	3939980	He was the co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons and TSR, and let's face it, without Dungeons
3939980	3943600	& Dragons, you would not have role-playing games like you have today.
3943600	3947800	Think about all the games that were inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.
3947800	3952360	I'm talking about everything from old school games like Ultima and the actual Dungeons
3952360	3958680	& Dragons games that were on the Apple IIe and all that, and to everything that we have
3958680	3959680	new today.
3959680	3964320	The Final Fantasies of the World, the Warcrafts, and if you've actually played D&D, there actually
3964320	3970040	are a lot of similarities between a huge game like World of Warcraft and this.
3970040	3974440	Unfortunately, he did pass away this week at the age of 69.
3974440	3979440	We do want to acknowledge the importance that this man had on the gaming industry, and certainly
3979440	3983360	we not only want to dedicate everything we've done tonight to his memory, but we thought
3983360	3986480	we'd close a little bit, again kind of breaking for him a little bit.
3986480	3991820	We thought we'd close tonight with a song, because moments of silence are kind of awkward
3991820	3997300	on podcasts, so we thought we'd instead play a song, and this song is from a game that
3997300	4001600	was definitely, you could say, directly inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.
4001600	4006440	It's the theme to Neverwinter Nights, and while we play this song, just maybe tip your
4006440	4011680	hat, bow your head, say some final words for Gary Gygax, the creator of Dungeons & Dragons
4011680	4037360	who passed this week at the age of 69.
4101680	4128360	Gary Gygax, the creator of Dungeons & Dragons who passed this week at the age of 69.
4128360	4142080	We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4142080	4143080	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
