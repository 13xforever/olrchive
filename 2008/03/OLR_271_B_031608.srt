00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,800
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,300
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 16th of 2008.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,500
Happy St. Patrick's Day Eve to those of you out there.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Don't forget to wear green tomorrow, or don't forget to wear green three days ago

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,200
if you're listening on the podcast because you guys get a little late.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,300
But hey, that's just part of the perks of listening live to us every Sunday night

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,000
when we tape over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
We have a chat room full of people who are doing that right now.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,300
And for all you guys, whether it be live, syndicated, or podcast,

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,800
we're going to get back into the gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,400
Yes.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,600
And if you live in the United States, you're probably looking forward to some pretty cool games

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,300
coming out into the arcade, like Tekken 6.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,600
You're never going to get to play Tekken 6 because it's never coming to the arcade in the U.S.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,900
So if you want to play in the arcade, got to go to Japan or hopefully find an arcade that will import it for you.

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,000
So that kind of sucks.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,900
Of which there are a few of those kind of places.

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,000
Like I think of that one place we always used to go to in L.A.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Yeah.

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,400
What was that, Arcade Infinity? Is that what it's called?

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,800
Yeah.

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,700
Apparently there are a few places that are importing them.

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,800
There's a place in Houston, I guess, that also has a Tekken 6 machine.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,300
But they're not going to be widely available like, you know, most fighting games are.

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,700
Go to an Amco arcade, they'll have it.

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,900
You think?

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,300
I'm pretty sure, because when I worked for Aladdin's Castle and Cyberstation,

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,200
we had like the super deluxe Tekken, this is when Tekken 3 came out.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,500
But we had them well before everybody else did.

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,300
But that was a U.S. release, right?

34
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,700
Well, right, but we had them for months before they were allowed in any other arcade.

35
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,900
My curiosity is, though, is I almost wonder if the opposite wouldn't be true,

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,500
is that since this game won't come out in the U.S.,

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,100
the Namco arcades wouldn't support them.

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,600
I don't know.

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,500
I would think that they're going to have one or two.

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,200
Hmm.

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,100
I really think that the bigger Namco locations would have one.

42
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,300
Well, we'll see what happens.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,400
Regardless, that kind of does suck, though.

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,100
I mean, to hear that a new Tekken game is coming out in the arcades is not...

45
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,000
That pisses me off!

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,100
Well, that's sad.

47
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,700
But that's where arcades are going.

48
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,300
It's not... That shows you how lucrative arcades are right now.

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,800
It's sad.

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
That makes my heart hurt.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Usagi's in chat and says,

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Man, I have three gamers in this room with me,

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,700
and they all gave me a dirty look when they got the news about Tekken 6.

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,300
Sorry, guys. We don't write the news. We just report it.

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
I would say write your cards and letters to Namco.

56
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,200
Let them know you want to see this game in the U.S.

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,000
and that you would spend money on it.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,700
Say Namco, we don't need any more fucking Pac-Man.

59
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,200
Bring us Tekken 6. Thank you.

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,100
Yeah, and phrase it just like that and see how far that gets you.

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,900
Alright.

62
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,200
That makes me very, very sad.

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
I'm sorry, are you going to write a letter?

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,500
Are you going to go there and run them over with a tank?

65
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,600
Haha!

66
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,900
Alright.

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,800
Moving on to what's hopefully a little bit happier news.

68
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,400
I don't know.

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,500
Gran Turismo 5, the prologue version.

70
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,900
Finally, some more information about that for the U.K.

71
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,100
We had some information about the U.S. last week,

72
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,800
but now we have some more information for the U.K.

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,100
It's going to be on the European PlayStation Store on March 27th,

74
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,400
followed immediately the very next day by a version on Blu-ray.

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
So yes, you can buy the prequel to a game that will be coming out on Blu-ray... whatever.

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,900
You all know the deal with Gran Turismo 5 prologue at this point.

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,800
The game will be coming out on that day,

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,000
and the price that you will pay for it is...

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,900
£24.99.

80
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,200
That's £24.99 pounds sterling in the U.K.

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,100
That's about $50 U.S.

82
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,200
That's just because the U.S. dollar sucks.

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
I might be at this point. I don't know.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
It really is.

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,000
That still kind of sucks.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Everyone's like,

87
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,900
Oh, stuff's so much more expensive in the U.K.

88
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,100
No, our dollar just really sucks. That's all.

89
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,900
Also, there's the Europe PS3 bundle.

90
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,500
They're actually getting a bundle that has prologue in it.

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,800
£299 for that on March 28th.

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,400
We talked about that last week.

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
That's right.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Just want to remind.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,700
They should have a little underscore on that.

96
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,300
You know, saying,

97
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,600
Get you ready for the full game when it finally comes out,

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
and we'll sell it to you for $60,

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,300
and you'll buy it because you are...

100
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,600
£60, which translates to, you know, $100 American, probably.

101
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
So...

102
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, at that time, it would be like $6 billion American.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,600
Well, for those loyal Tekken fans like me here over in the U.S.,

104
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,900
Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection Online players are going to be getting an update

105
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,700
that allows the DualShock 3 support.

106
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,700
So...

107
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,800
Yay.

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,600
It also will have some different online tweaks,

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
like a one-on-one pickup match,

110
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
some updates to the lobby,

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,100
and some of your ranking updates, that type of thing.

112
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,300
I'm like, okay.

113
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,600
Well, I guess that's kind of cool.

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
I mean, you know, considering, you know,

115
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,300
most people were missing Rumble pretty badly,

116
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,700
now the fact that they're going to bring it back, I guess...

117
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,100
I don't know, is it too little, too late, though?

118
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,600
Maybe.

119
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
I mean, do you think there'll be a lot of people that go back and say,

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,700
oh, I'm going to run back and play Tekken 5 because I can have Rumble now?

121
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,900
It's worth a try,

122
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,100
especially if you don't have to really, you know, pay anything for it.

123
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,700
I don't think anyone's going to really go back and play those games

124
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,200
just because they didn't have Rumble.

125
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,800
You know what, though?

126
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Then again, I think about myself,

127
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
and I actually went back and played...

128
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,200
Do you remember that game Crystal Quest

129
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,600
that came out on Xbox Live like a year ago?

130
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,000
You know they did an upgrade to that not that long ago?

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,800
They had upgraded a game that added some type of combo meter in it,

132
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,400
so I went back and played the game to see if the combo meter was exciting.

133
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,600
I played about half a game, then I quit.

134
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,900
Because I was like, uh...

135
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,200
This game was much cooler when it was like originally on the Apple in two colors,

136
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,800
white and black.

137
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,900
It lost something along the way, I'm not sure what.

138
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,500
I liked it back when it was on the PC,

139
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,200
in like magenta and cyan, yellow and black.

140
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,500
I never even played the PC version, I always...

141
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,300
Go CGA.

142
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,400
I always thought of it as a Mac game.

143
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Oh, I don't know if it was on the PC, I just, you know, like CGA.

144
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,100
Oh, you made it up.

145
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,600
I made it up.

146
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,200
I see how you are.

147
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,100
See, I'm so cool.

148
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,900
Wasn't there also a CGA like that had like,

149
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,100
I think it was like red, yellow, and green?

150
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,500
Yeah, it was red, yellow, green, and blue, I think.

151
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,400
You either had like, you know, the printer colors,

152
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,000
or like, you know, the crayon colors, I don't know.

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
But, uh, let's see here.

154
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,900
This week, completely off topic from CGA graphics,

155
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
um, Street Fighter IV...

156
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,800
And thank God!

157
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Street Fighter IV, full CGA graphics.

158
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,000
If we were reporting on a new game that supported CGA cutting-edge technology,

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'd be like, wow, that's kind of sad.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
You know what I did play once in CGA?

161
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
Tangent, tangent!

162
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,900
I played a strip poker game in CGA once.

163
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,900
You remember those old school strip poker games they released for like the old systems?

164
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,900
Like, there was, like, they had strip poker on the Commodore 64 and all that stuff.

165
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,900
It was just basically these really pixelated pictures of women.

166
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,200
You know, they had a CGA version of that.

167
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:24,800
There was, I don't, I remember that my grandparents or something bought us a Muppets game or something like that.

168
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,500
And we thought it didn't work.

169
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,400
Because the intro screen, or because it was in CGA or whatever,

170
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,100
we couldn't see that it said press any key to continue,

171
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,600
because it was written in black text on black.

172
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
So it was like, um, okay.

173
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
So finally, like one day, I turned the contrast up all the way.

174
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm like, hey, there's something written there!

175
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,500
And then I saw that and I hit the button and, wow, this game sucks!

176
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,000
Uh, and some folks in chat are asking what's CGA.

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,200
Again, CGA was the old school, like, PC color graphics adapter,

178
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,200
and it was when your monitors went from being monochromed to four colors.

179
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,200
And you could either have red, green, yellow, and black, or cyan, magenta, uh,

180
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
what am I missing?

181
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Yellow?

182
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Yellow and black? No, but it wasn't that though, was it?

183
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
White and black. It was cyan, magenta, white, and black.

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Oh, you're right, you're right.

185
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Okay, and then after CGA was EGA, extended graphics adapter, when it went up to 16 colors.

186
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Then we had VGA.

187
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
And then VGA, 256.

188
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
And then S-VGA.

189
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Super VGA, and pretty much everything you see now is some type of extension.

190
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
XGA, yeah.

191
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
All that crap, so.

192
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,200
There you have it, a little history lesson from your old friends at Orange Lounge Radio,

193
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,200
your ever-aging friends.

194
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Hey, I remember playing on monochrome.

195
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
So anyways, to get back into the story here, um...

196
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Yeah, Street Fighter IV for four colors, right?

197
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Yeah, Street Fighter IV, four color edition.

198
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Um, they're getting a brand new character, a lucha libre wrestler named El Frito, or

199
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Forte, I don't know how you pronounce it.

200
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
His name is El Farto?

201
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,200
His name is El Farto. No, I believe it's Ferté? I don't know.

202
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Wasn't that a Howard Stern character, Fartman, or something like that?

203
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Yes, Fartman was a Howard Stern.

204
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Do you think Howard Stern will sue Capcom?

205
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
No.

206
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Okay.

207
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,200
No, he should be El Aso Wipo, which would be fucking awesome if that was the case.

208
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Um, but yeah, he is basically, you know, luchador, and, you know, people are kind of comparing

209
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
him between, like, Vega and Rey Mysterio.

210
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
I don't know.

211
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Looks neat.

212
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,200
I am, I don't know, not that excited about Street Fighter IV, unfortunately.

213
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I was afraid they'd give us Rainbow Mika again.

214
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
You know what's funny? I tried, I...

215
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,200
I forced my wife to watch some lucha libre last night, just very briefly, because we

216
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,200
couldn't find anything on TV, so I'm like, okay, lucha libre, I'm gonna turn that on.

217
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Yeah, I don't like it.

218
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,200
RossdielUT in chat says, oh yay, another piss-poor Hispanic stereotype.

219
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Wrong, another piss-poor masked wrestler stereotype.

220
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
That's true, if he wears a mask, you don't necessarily know exactly what his name is.

221
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
You know what, they just...

222
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
He could be Asian.

223
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Or it could be, like, the end of Metroid.

224
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Ooh, a woman.

225
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Who knows?

226
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Here comes the mask.

227
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Holy woman.

228
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Alright, sorry, you had Star Chakra?

229
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm just saying, we just need, like, a new All Japan Wrestling game or something.

230
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
An All Japan Wrestling game?

231
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Well, this one, the wrestling leagues.

232
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Or did All Japan go, or was it Fire that went out?

233
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Fire Pro.

234
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Fire Pro Wrestling, they actually had a new game that came out last year.

235
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Because I really...

236
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
On PlayStation 2.

237
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I really think that, you know, we need to, because a lot of the WWF games that come out,

238
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,200
or WWE games that come out over here, have all of the moves from some of Japan's best

239
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
wrestlers in it.

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I was like, why don't they just do a game called Stereotypical Wrestler the Game?

241
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Awesome.

242
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,200
And have it just be, I mean, and true, you wouldn't have your support of your, you know,

243
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
your WWE franchises and all that, but you have all these classic moves and stuff shoved

244
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
into it.

245
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,200
And instead of being stuck in, like, 2D fighter, like what was the old WrestleMania that was

246
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
out way back in the day, where you could play as The Undertaker back when he was still really

247
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
cool and not riding a bike.

248
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,200
And who else was in that?

249
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Doink the Clown?

250
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
You could play as them.

251
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
You know...

252
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I would rather play as Pennywise the Clown.

253
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
That would be a video game I would buy.

254
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
We all float here.

255
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Anyway.

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Anyway.

257
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Kiss me, fat boy.

258
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,200
But, I think that if they're, they should just satisfy the world's apparent need that

259
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,200
they think that we have for, you know, wrestler stereotypes, and just do wrestler stereotype

260
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,200
the game, and have you make whatever you want.

261
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Even better.

262
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
I just worry that opens the door to racial stereotype the game, and not going to be a

263
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
good thing for video gaming's image.

264
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I want a game that combines wrestling and katamari, so that, like, as you're fighting

265
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,200
them, like, body parts fall off and get stuck on your body, and you're fighting them.

266
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Like, a fighting game where you're fighting, like, tons of people, and then your, like,

267
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
character has, like, 50 arms and stuff.

268
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
That'd be pretty cool.

269
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
What was that old school game?

270
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Thrill Kill?

271
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Really old school.

272
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Huh?

273
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Not Thrill Kill.

274
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
No.

275
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
It was, uh, it came out around the time of Mortal Kombat.

276
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Like, it tried to one-up Mortal Kombat.

277
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Pit Fighter?

278
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
And the attack buttons were, like, arm, arm, leg, leg, and head.

279
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,200
And, like, you would chop off limbs, and then the person couldn't use that type of attack

280
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
anymore.

281
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
CarnEvil?

282
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Was it Time Killers?

283
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Was that what it was?

284
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Time Killers.

285
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Was Time Killers?

286
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Time Killers.

287
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
It was, like, not Eternal Champion or something.

288
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
No, I'm pretty sure it was Time Killers.

289
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
It was Time Killers.

290
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
There was a Viking in it.

291
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I think it was, yeah.

292
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Yeah.

293
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Okay, it was Time Killers.

294
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Like, there you go.

295
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
You should have that game mixed with katamari.

296
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Time Killers 2.

297
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
You know what made me think of Thrill Kill is the character that, um, looks like, uh,

298
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Ken on one side and Ryu on the other side that are both hands, and a torso.

299
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Well, you do-

300
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
That's what it made me think of.

301
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,880
You know, spoiler, if you play to the end of Smash Bros. in single-player mode, the

302
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,680
boss is a giant hand, just like the last game.

303
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,440
Because the hand is always there.

304
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Alright.

305
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,360
And I think the hand is really Mickey Mouse.

306
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,400
In other Street Fighter news, if I may, uh, moving on to another anticipated Street Fighter

307
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,360
release is Street Fighter 2 HD, uh, I'm not gonna call the whole thing, it's like, what

308
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,240
is it, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo?

309
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,500
Forget it, it's Street Fighter 2 HD, okay?

310
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,120
This game is coming out, um, soon.

311
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
What do you mean it's the happy one?

312
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,760
Is that the one that the art is?

313
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,060
Yes, basically it's, you know, it's Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, but it's all been

314
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,800
completely redone in HD.

315
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,200
By one of my favorite groups of artists.

316
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,120
Yeah, it's gonna be cool, but here's the thing, you can get a sneak peek at it.

317
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,800
In the beta version, uh, if you buy Wolf of the Battlefield Commando 3, which is another

318
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:58,160
Xbox Live Arcade game, you'll get access to the Super Street Fighter 2 HD game, you get

319
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,720
an access key for the public beta stress test.

320
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,040
Something to note about that though, apparently in the stress test, the rumor is, it's only

321
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,080
Ken, it's only Ryu, and it's only one stage that you can play in.

322
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,080
But still, it's a sneak peek at what the game's gonna look like.

323
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,800
Wanna try another sneak peek of what the game will look like?

324
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,920
It's called Street Fighter 2.

325
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,080
It's already available on Xbox Live.

326
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm actually very excited about this because I had a whole bunch of Udon Cruz stuff, and

327
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,820
actually I keep them on my DeviantArt friends list, just to see the previews and the new

328
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,400
art coming out that they do, and their work is fantastic.

329
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,880
It's just really, really good and perfect for that genre.

330
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
I think it's really good.

331
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,780
Oh yeah, I don't mean to knock the awesome art style in this game, but do you know why

332
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,000
this game keeps getting pushed back?

333
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,680
So that we'll forget we already spent $10 on it a year ago.

334
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Just wanted to say.

335
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
I'm gonna get it.

336
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,980
So, it is a public beta of the game.

337
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
Call it what you will.

338
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,320
I don't know, in some way it seems to me like kind of a cheap tactic to get people more

339
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,520
incentive to buy this Commando 3, then again, why do you think tons of people bought Crackdown?

340
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,860
But Crackdown actually ended up to be a really good game.

341
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,280
Not to say that Commando 3 won't as well, but it's interesting that that same tactic

342
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,920
is now being employed elsewhere.

343
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
That's what I could do.

344
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Did you see Crackdown?

345
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
I like jumping the game.

346
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
It's awesome though.

347
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,160
Did you see the HD remake of 1942 that they were showing off too this week?

348
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,280
I had heard about it.

349
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,800
It didn't make the show real quick tonight, but what did you see about this?

350
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
It looks awesome.

351
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Well, I like 1942.

352
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
It's pretty cool.

353
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
That's a great series of games.

354
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,880
It's basically just redone all HD and pretty, I don't know.

355
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,240
You know, interesting that Capcom's revisiting a lot of their series in HD because you also

356
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,280
have Bionic Commando also coming out.

357
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,960
But that's kind of cool because a lot of it's been saying for a long time that's what they

358
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,800
should be doing, is remaking the games in HD and not just releasing frumpy old Tron

359
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
with no frills.

360
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Like Frogger and shit like that.

361
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
That's retarded.

362
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,680
With one graphics swap that doesn't really change anything.

363
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,300
Or Contra, you know, Konami, we're looking at you.

364
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,880
Come on, man.

365
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,800
Seriously, we played Frogger, do something with it.

366
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,720
It's changing the sprites a little bit.

367
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Does not cut it.

368
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,660
I still thought it was funny that when we got the old Contra over here, it actually

369
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,160
had less stuff to it than the original did.

370
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
You know what pissed me off?

371
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,440
You know what game I was randomly playing the other day, just for old time's sake, was

372
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,280
Gyruss on Xbox Live Arcade?

373
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Sweet!

374
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,840
Well, it is one of my all-time favorite shooters that they had in the arcade.

375
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I freaking love Gyruss.

376
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,360
I used to play it on Commodore 64 all the time, right?

377
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,480
And they have it on Xbox Live.

378
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,760
It came out quite some time ago.

379
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,220
I was playing it for old time's sake the other day, and I just remembered how pissed off

380
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,600
I was of the Xbox Live version, because the new graphics and upgraded graphics are awful.

381
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,000
I enjoy playing the game in classic mode much better.

382
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,760
You can't see the bullets in some of the animation in the remade version.

383
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
It's awful.

384
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Cry.

385
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Very sad.

386
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,120
Well, there's a little bit of other news that should make some people happy.

387
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Crysis Corps Final Fantasy VII Special Edition is coming out in the UK.

388
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:25,000
It's, well, actually more of a special pre-order edition that Gamestation is offering that

389
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,360
will have a 48-page art book and slipcase packaging.

390
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,600
It will be £29.99, and it's actually the same price as the non-special edition, so

391
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,440
basically you pre-order it from there, you get the Nito book, and you don't pay any different

392
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,880
than you would have otherwise.

393
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:56,000
But there are also, though, going to be getting Crysis Corps Final Fantasy VII on PSP in spring,

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
but Gamestation has it down for summer, so you'll actually get it before then.

395
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,480
Just hop on there and take a look at it.

396
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Hooray for incentives.

397
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Neat.

398
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,960
Unfortunately, I'm not getting anything like that over here as far as I'm aware.

399
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Boo.

400
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,560
Who cares?

401
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
It's an art book.

402
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,880
I mean, honestly, who keeps the art books and stuff?

403
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,560
I just like free things.

404
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,480
I had an art book for Try Again one time I bought.

405
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,520
I don't even know where the fuck it is now.

406
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
It's gone.

407
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Oh well.

408
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,240
So, unfortunately, and everyone's been kind of watching this a little bit, EA and their

409
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,800
bid to try to take over Take-Two, now they have decided to go hostile with their bid

410
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:46,560
and they're actually going to try to buy out individual shareholders now at $26 a share,

411
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:54,920
and no real comment to what's going to be happening here, but apparently EA has confirmed

412
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:01,860
that, yes, they are doing this, and Take-Two has basically informed their shareholders

413
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,920
to hold out a little bit to see what's going to happen or see what kind of decision they

414
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,640
come up with.

415
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
I don't know.

416
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,200
I don't like the whole thing at all because EA puts out some pretty good games, but at

417
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,720
the same time I know why they're doing it just to get rid of the 2K sports franchise,

418
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,880
and that's not a good thing.

419
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,080
I mean, the sports games really haven't innovated too much between releases, and now if they

420
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,040
have full reign over everything, what makes you think they're actually going to try to

421
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
innovate each year?

422
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
They don't have to.

423
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,640
An odd one in chat at chat.orangelaundryradio.com says, I expect EA to eventually just walk

424
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,720
into the boardroom with socks full of quarters.

425
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
You're ours now.

426
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,280
RossdielUT says, Take-Two put themselves in this position.

427
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,960
They're only ever in the green when GTA comes out, so of course shareholders are nervous.

428
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,200
Interesting point, though, kind of brought up there is that do you think that EA is trying

429
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,000
to do this now before Grand Theft Auto hits shelves?

430
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

431
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,840
I think that they're trying to, and if the shareholders were smart, they got to know

432
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,840
that Grand Theft Auto IV is going to fucking make tons and tons and tons and tons and tons

433
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
of money.

434
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,920
The problem, and they are right, they don't have a lot of great releases that come out,

435
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,040
but at the same time I think a lot of their money has been trying to defend themselves

436
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,820
against all these lawsuits and shit from stupid fuckers suing them for God knows what, blaming

437
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:27,420
them for all sorts of violence and problems and people being scarred for life because

438
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,760
they saw really crappy looking boobs in a game or something like that.

439
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,320
Just retarded shit.

440
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,880
And that whole thing about getting five dollars just from saying that, you know, Grand Theft

441
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,800
Auto made you, you know, violated you in so many ways?

442
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,640
It's just, it's really dumb, so hopefully, you know, hopefully they're not lazy with

443
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,860
this release if there is any content in there that's questionable because, you know, people

444
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:00,840
are going to find it if there is, and for the love of God, Manhunt 2, I mean, that's

445
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
a perfect example.

446
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,760
Here's another interesting comment from RossDlut, and Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer does far

447
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,760
more damage to EA than 2K Sports ever will, so there are other sports games coming out

448
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
from other places.

449
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Yeah?

450
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
So no.

451
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,960
Odd1, I keep reading for the same people, but these are good comments, Odd1 in chat

452
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,140
says it's not like they don't have other games, BioShock was 2K and their sports franchises

453
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,200
are perpetual sellers, but this company relies so much on one game, I worry.

454
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,080
Well, it's Take, well, everyone's focusing on Take Two, but Take Two owns, you know,

455
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,620
a bunch of smaller companies that do release a lot of stuff, like 2K releases quite a few

456
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,160
games throughout the year, plus, you know, they do have a lot of smaller stuff that they

457
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,800
deal with, like, not Destination, but like, no, Destination, or DSi games I think they

458
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,640
do, not Destineer, but they have a lot of releases that come out that a lot of people

459
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,560
don't realize are from them, and, you know, they do have solid stuff coming out, it's

460
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,200
just, yeah, they do rely a lot on Grand Theft Auto, but there's, you know, Midnight Club,

461
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,000
and they've got some good stuff in the pipelines, you know, Knorr, and the new Mafia game looks

462
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,080
okay, not that they're really that different than Grand Theft Auto, but at least they're

463
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,120
pretty decent games, and they make what they put out pretty good, like Warriors, holy crap,

464
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,000
the Warriors game is awesome, it's just, I don't know, I'd rather them kind of fumble

465
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,360
through it and be their own entity than EA buy them, because if EA buys them, then, I

466
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,800
think that could be starting a downfall of, like, the gaming industry, because you're

467
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,880
going to have EA and Activision owning everything, and then pretty soon, they're going to be

468
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,480
like, hey, you know what, we don't really have to innovate too much, and then people

469
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,440
are just going to lose interest in this shit, and they're just like, well, fine, I'm not

470
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,500
going to buy any more games anymore, and there goes the industry.

471
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,540
Or the industry turns independent, kind of like I was saying before, you have, you know,

472
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,080
the XLA stuff coming out, you know, that could be a whole, that I think is a really big thing,

473
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
I don't know.

474
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,880
The XNA stuff, yeah, it looks pretty good.

475
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm sorry, XNA, what the hell was I saying, XLA?

476
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,760
SSJ100Matt says Warriors MMO, please.

477
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,440
Yeah, that'd be awesome, and RossUUT in chat says, look, they still bleed money in the

478
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,480
years between Grand Theft Auto.

479
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,320
True they do, and I know developing from, you know, San Andreas to now, obviously the

480
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,640
last two prequel games that they released, Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories

481
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,040
weren't that great and didn't make them that much money, I don't think that much development

482
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,640
time went into them, though, either, because they're pretty much just using the old engines.

483
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,960
But that's the same thing that's going to happen with the newer games, you know, obviously

484
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,960
the next game, you know, they're probably going to do another Vice City or something

485
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,240
like that, it's going to be using a similar engine and another San Andreas, maybe they'll

486
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,360
use another similar engine, and those will make a lot of money as well.

487
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,360
So I don't know, a lot of development up front, but I think they make it up in the back end

488
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
a little bit.

489
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,620
All right, well, lots of legal news, I mean, you could consider that some type of legal

490
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,240
news, and then there's just lawsuits going everywhere this week, and they all center

491
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,400
around Guitar Hero.

492
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,280
Harmonix actually sued and then ensued Activision earlier this week, and it all had to do basically

493
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,840
that, okay, the original Guitar Hero, I guess, had some type of clause that Harmonix would

494
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,360
get some type of royalty payment, the way the royalty payments were set up, if they

495
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,880
ever left the series.

496
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,660
And there were two different figures, one was low, one was high, and they're basically

497
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,680
saying Harmonix was claimed that they were being paid the lower royalty scheme, and they

498
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,680
should be getting about $14.5 million out of Guitar Hero 3's profits.

499
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:35,560
But then I guess at some point this was retracted, so there it was, and I don't know if maybe

500
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,640
there was some type of settlement out of court, but the settlement was clearly retracted.

501
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,820
But then Gibson jumped in the mix, Gibson, of course, makes guitars, Gibson decided to

502
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,900
sue Activision, and they said the reason why is because Activision was actually infringing

503
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:59,520
on a patent that dates back nine years for technology to simulate a musical performance.

504
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,480
Activision is, of course, filed basically saying that the claim is invalid.

505
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,820
Gibson actually sent Activision a letter in January saying, Activision basically said,

506
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,160
you know, well, since you didn't really do anything about it, we thought it was okay.

507
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Interesting.

508
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,600
Yeah, just like immersion, well, you didn't say anything until now, so we thought it was

509
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,560
okay that we stole your shit.

510
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,920
But I thought Gibson was licensed for Guitar Hero, I mean, don't they have like Gibson

511
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
guitars?

512
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,560
Gibson licensed their guitars.

513
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,720
So this is stupid.

514
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,240
But then what's interesting about it is that you also kind of think about, hmm, you know,

515
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,120
whatever happened to Guitar Freaks, because even though Gibson owns the thing and it's

516
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,240
nine years old, nine years old places you back at what, 1999?

517
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,160
Well, guess what, Guitar Freaks was in the production and planning stages in 1998, around

518
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,160
the time the DDR first came out.

519
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,960
Did Gibson possibly catch wind of Guitar Freaks over in Japan and filed the patent here in

520
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,240
the U.S. and that's why Guitar Freaks never has really made it out here in the U.S.?

521
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,160
But it did make it out over here in the U.S., they released the U.S. version over here.

522
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:16,000
One very minor, not very well-heard of version that I bet completely slipped under most people's

523
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,280
radars, honestly.

524
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,640
They think if it comes out in Japan it's, you know, free reign to, you know, take it

525
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
here.

526
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,400
Odd One says, I love that conspiracy theory.

527
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
I do too.

528
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,660
No, I'm pretty sure, I'm more than positive that that was the biggest influence.

529
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,920
I'm tired of people like patenting all this shit like, you know, device tube simulate

530
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
performance.

531
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,620
Okay, well that could be anything, I mean.

532
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,320
And at some point though, if Gibson doesn't do it, it should negate itself.

533
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,440
What did Gibson put out?

534
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,560
Or maybe, I don't know, maybe there was some kind of, teach yourself at home.

535
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,480
Yeah, I would love to see their patent for this, I mean, because what is it?

536
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,080
It's a concept of, you know, simulating a performance.

537
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,520
Okay, so pretending is now being patented.

538
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
That's it.

539
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,640
I am patenting imagination because, you know, the ability to simulate anything in your mind,

540
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,620
I now own the rights to that.

541
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,760
So all you fuckers better pay up because I need the money.

542
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,240
Alright, look, all these lawsuits are kind of just, they seem unnecessary and confusing

543
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,760
and just trying to follow them all gets us a little bit angsty.

544
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,900
And you know what happens when we get angsty?

545
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,280
We play the FUs of the week music.

546
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:46,680
Hi, FU of the week, and I've got a couple actually, goes to this device that I'm about

547
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:55,440
to put up on the webcam, and I am currently strapping it to my hand as I, as I speak.

548
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
It is the stupid finger brace that they think I'm supposed to be wearing, that I'm not gonna,

549
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,360
because it rubs a wall spot on my hand, and that's because I'm not backwards.

550
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,480
Yeah, I didn't get the cortisone shot in my hand like I thought I was going to.

551
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,680
Instead, they're putting me in a brace for another month, and I get the cortisone shot

552
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,800
right after my birthday.

553
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,080
You might want to say that just really quickly one more time, because while you're trying

554
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,360
to put the brace on, the mic was far away, it couldn't hear you.

555
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Oh, I was thinking that.

556
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
That's alright.

557
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Um, yeah.

558
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,720
I put this on because I'm going to put it on the webcam to show everybody, they put

559
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,640
me in a brace for my finger that I'm supposed to be wearing when I'm not typing or otherwise

560
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,140
doing stuff, and it's actually a big pain in the ass because I can't, it's to keep me

561
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,520
from bending my finger at the primary joint where I've got the swelling on the tendon.

562
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:49,160
So they didn't do the cortisone shot, instead I am getting it done two days after my birthday.

563
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,720
It's a fuck you enhancement tool.

564
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,920
It is a fuck you enhancement tool.

565
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
You should go show the folks on JustinTV.

566
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
That's what I said I was gonna.

567
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,000
Alright, then go, go ahead.

568
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,840
And the other, the other F.U. goes to my husband for assigning me housework, which yes, true,

569
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,680
it needed to be done, but it's all stuff that involved using my right hand to squeeze things,

570
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,120
as in the vacuum, the mop, the broom, and well, I'm not supposed to be doing that with

571
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,920
that hand, and I had forgotten to take my anti-inflammatory, so it hurt like a bitch

572
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
by the time I was done.

573
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,920
It's the point that it started popping again, so it was really, really, really fucked up,

574
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
but I'll go put it on the webcam.

575
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,200
Alright, meanwhile, Loki, F.U. the people that went and saw the movie Horton Hears a

576
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,340
Who during our private screening, two groups of people in particular, number one was the

577
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:44,480
people that thought it was smart to try to movie hop into our private screening for our

578
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
company.

579
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,860
I mean, these are people that actually think that we're not gonna notice somebody that

580
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:55,200
doesn't work in our company coming in, meanwhile, like with like a half an hour left of the

581
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,880
movie to go, with their four screaming kids, and then after they came in, spilled popcorn

582
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,640
on the floor, they also managed to ask people to move so that their screaming kids can sit

583
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,040
in the seat.

584
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,400
Mind you that these people have been sitting watching the movie patiently for like an hour

585
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,160
prior to that.

586
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,480
So F.U. to them, and also F.U. to the person sitting next to me with their screaming child

587
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,000
who didn't wanna be, or didn't wanna watch the movie anymore, he was running around in

588
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,600
the aisles and stuff, and smashing popcorn on the floor, and slamming the seats down,

589
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,640
and the father was like, stop laughing, stop laughing, you know, cuz, you know, quiet.

590
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,920
How dare you laugh at this funny movie!

591
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,680
Shouldn't they have been kicked out?

592
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,920
Well, they should have been, but, you know, movie theater people are, you know, lame and

593
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,680
they don't like to do anything, and they don't get paid enough to do anything.

594
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Why did you get the manager?

595
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Well, I didn't feel like leaving the theater, and I could possibly tolerate this kid, but

596
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,320
he was annoying, and everyone was staring at him, but the dad was just stupid, and,

597
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
you know.

598
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,600
Oh well, everyone will talk about him behind his back when he gets back to work on Monday.

599
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,480
Alright, my F.U. of the week goes to the random pains that I've been having, and the fact

600
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,540
that I was taking all these drugs to counter the pain, and I might have caused more pain

601
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,840
by doing that, and F.U. to the fact that on the antibiotic I was taking, the sticker that

602
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,920
says do not take with antacids was probably not large enough, because I ended up taking

603
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:27,280
an antacid, and I think I fucked some- I hurt, but I'm having a hard time with telling

604
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,140
you tonight's show, but I'll be okay.

605
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,760
Just F.U. to mystery pain that after the lab tests and blood work and all this stuff I

606
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,360
had, they still can't figure out what it is, although thankfully my abdominal pain is really

607
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,560
going away, so I guess that's good.

608
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,320
It's one of those mystery things we'll never understand.

609
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,280
So yeah, F.U. to random sickness and pain.

610
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
It sucks.

611
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,680
No, I'm not pregnant, chat.

612
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
F.U.

613
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
F.U. to chat.

614
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,960
Why do they say you're pregnant?

615
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,200
I don't know, because you know when you have abdominal pain, it might be the baby kicking.

616
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,000
I don't know.

617
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
I can't explain their reasoning.

618
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,520
All right, we are going to go to one of our favorite segments here on the program.

619
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,000
It's the part where you guys get to interact with us.

620
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,680
It's the part called the mailbag.

621
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
It's not just a clever name.

622
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,740
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is where you send your emails, of which not very many

623
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,080
of you sent in emails this week.

624
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,520
I'm quite disappointed in our listenership.

625
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,560
Dark Soccer is thrilled, because she doesn't have to do much work in this segment tonight.

626
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,120
However, I am furious.

627
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,560
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

628
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,640
Send us those questions you've always wanted to ask us, those comments you wanted to say.

629
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,520
Meanwhile, Dark Soccer will open up and read the crumbs that we do have.

630
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,640
First email comes from DJ Jinai.

631
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,520
It says, Hi, O.L.R.

632
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
It's DJ Jinai.

633
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,720
Oh, that's not just a clever name.

634
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,040
It says, Check this out.

635
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,760
And basically, it's a link to something.

636
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:58,520
Smile DK will be looking for their samurai at San Japan, first major anime convention

637
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:09,520
in SA-to-premier band's first-ever U.S. debut concert.

638
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,160
San Japan and Viverus Studios are proud to announce the North American musical debut

639
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:20,520
concert of their fan-favorite band, Smile DK, making their grand appearance at San Japan

640
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:26,160
2.5, the first major Japanese culture and anime convention in San Antonio, Texas, as

641
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,840
they will be performing on August 9, 2008 at El Tropicano Riverwalk Hotel in downtown

642
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,440
San Antonio, Texas.

643
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,600
I'm sure most of us know who Smile DK is.

644
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,400
Anyway, they're going to have a new single, so I thought that was pretty cool, and thanks

645
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,400
for letting us know about that so that we can tell everybody.

646
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:54,520
I hope they sing Butterfly.

647
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,280
As an avid UK-based listener of your show, my heart nearly skipped a beat at the news

648
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,160
last week of Super Smash Bros.

649
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,440
Brawl's launch, Imagine My Horror, but lack of disbelief, when I then checked with my

650
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,040
friendly favorite online retailer and found out that Super Smash Bros.

651
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,520
Brawl wasn't to be released until June in the UK.

652
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,560
Let's write a three-month wait for a AAA title that has already been translated into English.

653
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,240
The thing is, I know why this happens, it's the whole NTSC, PAL, and multiple European

654
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,120
language thing means that there will be delays, but Nintendo has launched simultaneous releases

655
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,760
before.

656
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,920
To be honest, I really don't see why Nintendo and other companies cannot treat the UK as

657
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,460
a separate territory to the rest of Europe.

658
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,360
We don't even have the same taste in games, not that I wish to arouse traditional British

659
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,080
anti-continental sentiment, if it's in English release the damn game in the country that

660
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
made the damn language.

661
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,000
Well, there's a lot of games that get released in the UK too that we don't receive over here

662
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
until a lot later.

663
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
We didn't get Mother 3.

664
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,880
Like anything from Eidos.

665
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,560
We didn't get Mother 3.

666
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,840
The other thing too is that a lot of games like Smash Bros., it's selling like hotcakes

667
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,040
and they can't make enough discs.

668
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,440
Well, there's more to this email.

669
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,720
As for Super Smash Bros. Brawl, I bought the new freeloader disc for the Wii and have imported

670
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
a copy of the game from Canada.

671
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,920
Here's me flippin' the bird to you Nintendo of Europe.

672
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,240
As for the Digidoo Technoguy, I've seen him in person.

673
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,780
He was playing on the streets of Edinburgh during the Edinburgh Arts Festival in Scotland

674
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
last summer.

675
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,600
I have my own video footage if you want to see slash hear more, and I guess it would

676
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,480
be pronounced Nige.

677
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
So that's cool.

678
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Next email?

679
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
Alrighty.

680
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Hey, OLR crew.

681
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:56,160
In the words of AVGN, you know it's bullshit.

682
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,440
People who complain that a game is too short just because it takes under 10 hours to complete.

683
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,480
Whatever happened to a time when games usually took 30 to 60 minutes to clear and gamers

684
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,920
were happy with it?

685
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,000
These days, when I read a review of an arcade-style scrolling shooter or 2D platformer, one complaint

686
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,240
that I see commonly that sticks out to me is that the game is short.

687
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,920
I understand that longer, more epic games allow you to take in the game environment

688
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,760
and absorb yourself in the character, but it's nice to play a quick short game that

689
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,240
is intended to be replayed again and again.

690
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,200
Even Gradius 5, a shooter that takes an hour and a half to complete, gets complaints of

691
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,800
being too short.

692
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,760
Someone please explain to me how a 25-hour shmup would work out and how that isn't going

693
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,800
to put a strain on the level designers.

694
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,360
Now a year and a half ago, you asked listeners if games these days are getting easier.

695
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,600
This is related to that question.

696
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,840
Do you think games are getting longer and longer and that shorter meant-to-be-beaten-in-one-sitting

697
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
games are going away?

698
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,880
That's from GS68.

699
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,960
You know, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head there is that it's not the fact

700
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,080
maybe that a game takes less than 10 hours to beat that people rag on it, but if it has

701
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,860
no replay value, then, you know, it sucks.

702
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:10,680
For instance, a game like Katamari Damacy, can't you roll through that game in like two

703
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
or three hours tops?

704
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,400
Yeah, but you can go back through and get the challenges.

705
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,800
Exactly, and that's why people love that game because you have the total replay value and

706
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,880
just, you know, it's cool to go roll stuff up.

707
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,840
Now even though I kind of think they've beaten the Katamari franchise into the ground, but

708
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,040
never mind, I'm talking about, you know, the original one, had definite replay value to

709
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
it.

710
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,400
Well, we've gone back though and put in all of our old shooters before, even though you

711
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,960
pretty much play them all the same way.

712
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Sure.

713
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,160
I mean, how many times do I just go talking about, you know, loving R-Type, for example?

714
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,040
But a game like a role-playing game that really relies on story to, you know, motivate you

715
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,880
to play the game, you know, once you've played through the story once, very few RPGs have

716
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,560
a lot of replay value.

717
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Chrono Trigger.

718
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,520
Well, you know, obviously some do with, be it multiple endings, super bosses, whatever

719
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,760
it is, you know, they try to put a little more value in it.

720
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,560
Every RPG needs Game Plus.

721
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,080
But that's why some RPGs feel a little bit lacking, is that when they don't have that

722
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,620
and they're only ten hours to beat, then, you know, it might be.

723
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,960
So it really depends on what type of game it is, I guess.

724
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,640
Well, it is even bringing up though with people complaining that Gradius 5 was short even

725
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,000
though it was an hour and a half, and I completely disagree with them saying it was remotely

726
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
short.

727
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That a shooter, you know, shouldn't need to be more than, like, an hour in length.

728
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,520
Because the whole point is to get from point A to point B, and then hopefully pass the

729
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:36,820
boss at point B and get to point C. You know, I actually liked some of the, I guess, not

730
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,820
as long shooters.

731
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:44,000
Like, I played through Cotton however many times, and Raiden DX is another one of my

732
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,680
favorite shooter games.

733
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,000
Just with shooter games, part of the fun is trying to play it through it and beat your

734
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,840
score or beat it faster, you know, and start to learn the patterns in the game, you know?

735
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
I could tell you anything.

736
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,080
I could probably pick up SkyShark right now and play through the first four levels and

737
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,440
not die because I had the game memorized because that's the only damn way you could play through

738
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,480
that game was to memorize where everything was.

739
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Nice.

740
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,520
But still, I mean, I think that half of it is just being able to, you know, you challenge

741
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,980
your way through it and you pod through it and then you get bragging rights, like, watch

742
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,980
me play through this game.

743
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,480
I can do, like, you know, beating R-Type on one token, for example.

744
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,600
That gives you major bragging rights, you know what I mean?

745
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
That is pretty hardcore.

746
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Yeah.

747
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,760
I say token because I miss arcades.

748
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,240
So last email, because we actually got another one while we were sitting here.

749
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,600
Just now?

750
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,840
Not just now, but we got it right, poor pull-up millet.

751
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Gotcha.

752
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,240
So, virtual console games are overpriced.

753
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,200
You guys have already gone over this, but you haven't gone over it in a while, so this

754
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,560
is kind of irrelevant to, well, anything.

755
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,960
But I have, but I have an idea to fix it.

756
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,320
If people pay yearly subscriptions for Xbox Live and Nintendo could do something like

757
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
that for virtual console.

758
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,400
Yes, I mean, exactly along the lines of the Sega channel because I freaking love the Sega

759
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
channel.

760
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,720
It's not, I'm not actually sure how it would work, but I thought I would share it, and

761
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
that's from Red Ring Saturn.

762
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Yeah?

763
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,400
Oh, I'm sorry, why don't I have one more time real quick?

764
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Oh, I was working on something else, sorry.

765
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,440
Well, we've actually brought this up on the show of instead of paying for your virtual

766
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,800
console games, you pay a subscription cost, like...

767
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,360
Oh, like GameTap.

768
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Yeah.

769
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
Basically.

770
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,560
I would love to see Nintendo set something like that up.

771
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,240
They're talking about the Sega channel.

772
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,840
Yeah, a lot of their games, you know, you don't want to spend five bucks on, you know,

773
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,080
a game that you only want to play a couple times, but I think that's exactly why it's

774
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:45,120
not set up that way because I think Nintendo, in a way, kind of preys on that sort of system.

775
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,140
I've also heard of Xbox Live, you know, somebody had suggested instead of charging the five

776
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:56,740
dollars for the game, you pay 25 cents a play, but, you know, then I think about like some

777
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,920
of the systems like back in the 80s and 90s, like I remember I had an old school cable

778
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
system back in the 80s.

779
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,760
It was way ahead of its time.

780
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,720
We had a system where you could actually buy games for like 10 cents a game and play them,

781
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,720
and it didn't do very well.

782
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,600
It wasn't very well received.

783
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,680
People don't like to play that way for whatever reason.

784
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,440
I think honestly if they stop making money, they'll change it, but in the meantime it

785
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,560
works and if it ain't broke, they ain't going to fix it.

786
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,400
I mean it might sound better from a consumer end, but, you know, look at what GameTap is

787
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
made up of though.

788
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,060
GameTap kind of makes a thriving on.

789
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,920
It doesn't have a lot of, I mean it has, I shouldn't say it doesn't have a lot, it has

790
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,400
some huge name AAA titles in it, but a lot of GameTap's charm is discovering old classics

791
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,480
you missed the first time.

792
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,120
Nintendo, Xbox Live, they don't really need to do that for various reasons.

793
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,320
So that was the last email?

794
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
It was.

795
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
I double checked.

796
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
All right.

797
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:55,160
Well, we're going to supplement the emails this week with some voicemails that we've

798
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,360
gotten throughout the week.

799
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,320
So let's actually go and check out some voicemails that we've received this week.

800
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,760
Please don't call the show because we're not actually taking Skype calls at this time.

801
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,040
We're just trying to get through some voicemails.

802
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,040
And when you call, it switches my window on me and it makes me very angry.

803
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,640
It makes me want to make you not able to call us later.

804
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
Hey, O.R.R.

805
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
It's PKJR92.

806
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:22,000
Just wanted to tell you guys that you guys are the greatest.

807
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,320
And if you're not for the difference in time zones, I will post them live every Sunday

808
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,080
on every show on your network.

809
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:39,560
Just want to say, guys, you guys are great, thanks.

810
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:48,600
And to do a show earlier, like earlier, so that people in other time zones, like me,

811
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,600
I'm like three hours behind you, or sorry, ahead of you.

812
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,720
So 12 o'clock at night is kind of late because I've got school tomorrow, school the next

813
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,720
day, et cetera.

814
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:10,480
Just want to say that keep going, because you guys are the only podcast I listen to,

815
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,800
so the only ones I like.

816
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
So see you.

817
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,400
Well, thank you very much for that voicemail.

818
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,840
The reason why we don't tape our show earlier is because, keep in mind, even though it's

819
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,020
three hours later and all that, we do understand, we have some folks that stay up insanely late

820
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,800
to listen to our show, and nothing but props to you guys.

821
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,760
The problem is, though, if we tape earlier, then we totally have to give up our Sunday,

822
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,700
and Sunday's sometimes the day to get errands done, clean the house, or whatever, it really

823
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,400
would cut into the day.

824
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,400
So that's why we don't tape any of our Sundays, although we have been talking about doing

825
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,640
a one-off noon show.

826
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,080
We were going to tape at noon, so that way, especially the overseas listeners could tune

827
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
in live.

828
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,080
We just need to set a date for that.

829
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,080
We need to make that happen.

830
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,080
Well, let me know.

831
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,320
I've got two days off next week.

832
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
We'll see.

833
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,000
Two days off next week will work for me, but maybe later in the month or early April, sooner

834
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
rather than later.

835
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,880
We'll talk about that in our super secret forums where we discuss show thingies.

836
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,700
All right, so we'll make that happen for you guys.

837
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,700
Let's do one more voicemail.

838
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,360
I thought this one was pretty good.

839
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
Hello.

840
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
This is DSmaster25.

841
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
I'm a UJANA fan.

842
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
How dare you bash Hannah Montana?

843
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
Good Lord.

844
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
She's the best Sony fan in the world.

845
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
She's the best.

846
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:26,680
How dare you bash Hannah Montana, good Lord, she's the best Sony for once.

847
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,720
I'd like to see them get bashed.

848
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:36,200
Not my favorite pop star, Ole Miss Miley, okay, Hannah Montana.

849
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:43,720
Stop that here or I'm not watching any more shows.

850
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,720
Bye.

851
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,920
Well, I didn't realize we had legions of Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus fans that listen to

852
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,640
our show, so I think we need to take a moment to apologize to all the Hannah Montana fans

853
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,640
that listen to our program.

854
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:07,920
So we apologize dearly if you were offended by our comments on Hannah Montana, no we don't,

855
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,160
and we're really sorry we won't try to do it or we'll try not to do that again in the

856
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:18,000
future, and remember, hey, we're big fans of Hannah Montana's DS game, especially Footy

857
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Monster.

858
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,720
But don't listen to him, it's not because it's a good music game, he just secretly really

859
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:33,240
loves Hannah Montana.

860
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,560
I just love the chat lighting up here, DDR Dollar Bill, what the fuck is this?

861
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,360
The fuck is this trash, Frisbee, why do people actually like her?

862
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,160
DDR Dollar Bill, I've never even heard her.

863
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:53,000
Is that what's popular?

864
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,800
Leave Hannah Alone, how was that voicemail?

865
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:03,560
Leave Hannah Alone, I get it, doing the whole Britney thing, yeah, please, back to gaming

866
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,560
please.

867
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:11,040
So this I'm sure is a shocker to everybody, but guess what, 2KMarin is actually working

868
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:20,320
on Bioshock 2, and they have peg day, I don't know, forecasted release date of quarter four

869
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,500
2009.

870
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:31,340
So Christmas 2009, you'll be playing Bioshock 2, hooray!

871
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:41,760
That's shocking, what, Bioshock 2 is coming out, I am so shocked, beyond belief, I would

872
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:51,280
have never guessed, you know what, EA is working on Madden 2009, and after that Madden 2010,

873
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,040
but it makes me wonder though, aren't you violating an NDA by saying that, might be,

874
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,720
but you know what makes me kind of wonder, because you know how it's like Madden 08,

875
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,680
or Madden 09, what are they going to do, Madden 10, maybe, why not, it's going to have Madden

876
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,680
2010.

877
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,240
Are these things really worth losing sleep about, or wasting time on an internet radio

878
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,240
program talking about?

879
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,520
I don't know, it's like the whole, you know, Y2K, but with Madden numbers, something's

880
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,840
going to happen, it's going to like open a rift or something, we'll see what happens.

881
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:25,760
Hey, here's another series that keeps on going, Guilty Gear!

882
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,800
Guilty Gear 2 Overture is coming out, but it's not the same type of Guilty Gear you

883
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,240
might be thinking of, it's coming out this fall for the Xbox 360, it's a tactical action

884
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,240
game.

885
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,040
Now it's like 3D, it takes all these characters you might know from the Guilty Gear, which

886
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,760
by the way is a 2D fighting game, and now they're going to be in a 3D action strategy

887
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,600
type of game, so it works so well for Soul Calibur, when it went to Soul Calibur Legends,

888
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,600
why not?

889
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
I've played it actually.

890
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Really?

891
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
Yes.

892
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,600
What do you think?

893
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:02,640
I think it's going to be a Japanese account on Xbox Live, but it's okay, it's very similar

894
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,360
to like Dynasty Warriors on 99 Nights, but in the Guilty Gear universe.

895
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,360
I actually kind of liked 99 Nights for a little bit, and then it got a little old to me.

896
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,420
It's very similar to that, like you've got enemies you kill, and checkpoints you get

897
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:22,840
to, and you take them over, and that kind of stuff, definitely not a fighting game if

898
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,600
that's what you're expecting.

899
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,600
It's okay.

900
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,600
I just wish a lot of these things when they come to new systems, you know what, people

901
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,660
just like fighting games, so just release Guilty Gear as a fighting game, but they did

902
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,760
do that already on the Wii, so at least they get it for some systems, so it's just, others

903
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,280
are just trying something a little different, so more power to them I guess, trying to innovate

904
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,920
SNK, come on.

905
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,720
Well I don't know, I think I'll probably just end up passing on this game, maybe it's just

906
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,720
Sony.

907
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:59,600
Well, other people who said pass were actually Microsoft.

908
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:05,320
There was a rumor going around, especially since Sony, one of the Sony executives told

909
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:11,000
the Financial Times that Sony was in talks with Microsoft about offering them a Blu-ray

910
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,320
drive for the Xbox 360, but Aaron Greenberg, who's their group product manager for Xbox

911
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,360
360 said, nuh-uh, no, to quote, Xbox is not currently in talks with Sony or the Blu-ray

912
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,280
association to integrate Blu-ray into the Xbox experience.

913
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:35,120
That's a neat way to phrase it, the Xbox experience, but he did go on to say though that right

914
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:43,800
now Xbox 360 is the only console offering digital distribution of entertainment content.

915
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,360
We don't really know how long they're gonna be the only ones that does that, seeing that

916
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:56,680
Sony owns a movie company, but hey, a bunch of us who lucked out the tail end of that

917
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:04,560
and picked up on those cheap HD DVD players, hey, I even got five free HD DVDs.

918
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,600
The Xbox experience.

919
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,600
I know, that's so cool.

920
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,600
You know what the Xbox Live experience is?

921
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,640
Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit, fuck, gay, gay, fuck, fuck.

922
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,200
That's the Xbox Live experience right there.

923
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,120
There's lots of other words in there, too, I don't feel like repeating.

924
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,840
So what part of the Xbox experience is the Red Ring of Death?

925
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,520
Is that the fun part?

926
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,600
I mean, just wondering.

927
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,760
I did think that was a witty retort, though, that the Xbox does not need a Blu-ray drive

928
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,560
because they have downloadable movies.

929
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,560
So ha.

930
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,560
And they're already high-definition.

931
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:45,200
Yeah, here's a little problem with that logic, though, folks, and anyone that actually watches

932
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,320
a lot of pay-per-view stuff knows, movies don't come out on street date on that service,

933
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:56,840
usually it's a month later, so if you want to watch it day one, Blu-ray, well, hopefully

934
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:03,800
Blu-ray is the only way to go on that stuff, or you can watch it on DVD, I guess.

935
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:09,760
That's the angle they should work on that shit, but who really cares, I mean, come on.

936
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:18,480
I think that them accepting Blu-ray right now into their experience is sort of like

937
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,960
admitting some sort of defeat to Sony in some respect.

938
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,520
We ain't talking to those bitches.

939
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,080
Like, uh-uh.

940
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,280
I don't care what they have, we don't want their shit.

941
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,400
Yeah, I mean, it would look kind of silly for Microsoft to kind of endorse a Sony product

942
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,520
like that, but I would think that in the next Microsoft system, they're going to have to

943
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,040
support Blu-ray somehow, I would think, but who knows, you know?

944
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,000
We don't play DVDs, you don't necessarily have to play movies to be a console that succeeds.

945
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,040
Hey, they can always do the Dreamcast path.

946
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,640
They can always put HD DVD drives in there and use that as the format for the system,

947
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,800
because who says that they have to stop making discs for it, I mean, even though Toshiba

948
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,800
has stopped making them, but still, at the same time, who makes UMDs, you know?

949
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,640
Wouldn't that seem like a step backwards if Microsoft in their next system put an HD DVD

950
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,640
drive in them?

951
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,760
It'd be hard to copy them if there's no HD DVD drives out there, now would it?

952
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,760
Interesting thought.

953
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,740
I suppose you have this format already built up in some movie, well, it'd be interesting,

954
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,520
but I don't know, I just don't see it happening.

955
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,120
It'd be akin to using the, like I was bringing up with the Dreamcast, it'd be akin to using

956
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:28,960
the Giga discs, and you know how long it took them to crack those.

957
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,600
One cool thing, though, that is entertainment related, and I guess download content, new

958
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
islands coming to Burnout Paradise.

959
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,940
A bunch of new stuff that you'll be able to play and drive your cars through and crash

960
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,940
through and stuff.

961
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,280
In fact, actually, you can kind of see some of what's going to be available on that in

962
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,600
the game right now, because there's actually bridges that are being worked on and constructed,

963
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,640
I guess, in the game.

964
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,660
So later on, what they're going to do is have a free download, yes, because these islands

965
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:04,680
are going to be free, and you'll be able to expand your experience on Burnout Paradise.

966
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,080
There are also going to be some new cars available as well, those are not free.

967
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,080
But those are optional.

968
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,080
Interesting.

969
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,240
Who really needs extra cars when there's a lot in the game, anyways?

970
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,920
I would think, now I don't know, I'm not a hardcore racing fan, but I would think the

971
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,720
new areas are more of a perk than a new car.

972
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,720
Yeah.

973
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,720
Huh.

974
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,720
By a long shot.

975
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,520
Unless a new car is a super jetmobile that can jump 500 miles or something like that,

976
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,200
in which case I'll need that.

977
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,600
The new car is Sonic.

978
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:38,960
Just like, was it in Ridge Racer, where you have the hover cars and the rocket cars.

979
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,200
That's one thing about Ridge Racer, it's awesome.

980
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,960
Some rumors are abounding about Grand Theft Auto IV, and that is its new multiplayer modes.

981
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,200
Sixteen players and fifteen different modes in the game, this all coming from PlayStation

982
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,960
Magazine in Spain, a translation from that magazine.

983
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,320
And there it is, so supposedly it's going to be sixteen player modes, does that make

984
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,320
you pretty excited, Loki?

985
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,320
Oh hell yes.

986
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,880
I know you're very excited about, are you going to be able to network that many systems

987
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,880
at work?

988
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,000
We have five already, six if I get this other one working.

989
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Jeez.

990
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
All right, very cool.

991
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,020
Although I'm not too optimistic about this sixth one, but five.

992
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:24,260
Some of the games from their translations, Hangman's News, Carjack City, Bomb Debase,

993
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:31,540
Mafia Work, Death Batch, Turf War, Cops and Crooks, Race, Dealbreaker, Free Mode.

994
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,640
We are going to, you know.

995
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,080
Does it sound legit to you?

996
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:40,280
I think it sounds legit, that stuff sounds very legit.

997
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,240
I can't wait to play this game, we're going to be playing this thing every day, dude.

998
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,880
And I don't know, we're just going to kick everyone's ass online, it'll be fun.

999
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,400
I hope the game sucks, just to spite you.

1000
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,640
Yeah, too bad it's not going to happen.

1001
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,640
We'll see.

1002
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:01,240
Well, this actually makes me kind of happy, because everyone knows I'm a big Dreamcast

1003
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,760
fan.

1004
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:11,160
We are getting Mr. Driller online, a downloadable version that's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

1005
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,360
There's not a whole bunch of details on it right now, but it's been confirmed for a spring

1006
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,880
release in Japan.

1007
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,260
So hopefully we won't get it too much longer after, and it's Mr. Driller.

1008
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,760
I'm sure we'll get it at the same time.

1009
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,240
There hasn't really been any releases in Japan on Xbox Live Arcade that we haven't gotten

1010
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
at the same time, as far as I'm aware.

1011
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,880
Well, then even better.

1012
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,880
I don't know.

1013
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,480
It'll be a first, I guess.

1014
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,880
Hitstun and Chat says, this looks just like Mr. Driller DS.

1015
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,160
I wouldn't doubt that, it's Mr. Driller.

1016
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:50,160
It probably does look like most versions of Mr. Driller, because it is Mr. Driller.

1017
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,880
Mr. Driller's kind of cool.

1018
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,800
It seems really easy at first, but there's a lot of depth to the puzzle in the game.

1019
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,160
It's interesting.

1020
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:05,120
A new version of the Wii's Twilight Hack, and that is the hack using Twilight Princess

1021
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,980
to run homebrew code, has been made available.

1022
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:16,320
It's version 0.1A3, and now what's kind of neat about it is that you'll be able to run

1023
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:22,720
data off of SD memory cards using the SD memory card slot in the Wii system itself.

1024
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:29,280
Prior to that, you'd have to have an SD Gecko or some sort of GameCube adapter to run it

1025
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,640
off of SD memory cards, but now you can actually do it on the drive.

1026
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,960
Right now, though, not many things supporting it.

1027
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:43,120
Only game that actually works with it right now is a version of Tetris, but soon it will

1028
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,160
be supporting a lot more things, but that's just kind of interesting that they have this

1029
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,360
exploit in there, and I don't know if Nintendo will be able to fix it.

1030
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,440
I'm sure it'll be in the next patch.

1031
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,560
That loophole's going to get closed right up, but who knows?

1032
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,560
Maybe they'll luck out.

1033
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,120
Yeah, I know, it's worked out well for Sony so far.

1034
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,200
Some folks that have not lucked out are folks that were looking forward to playing Army

1035
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:15,360
of Two across different regions, because Army of Two apparently has region-locked online

1036
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,360
play.

1037
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,440
There's a very, very small little note in the manual for Army of Two.

1038
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,760
Note, the online game modes in Army of Two are not cross-region compatible and is only

1039
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,160
supported between PAL disks.

1040
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,580
Of course, the PAL version's manual has that note in there, so if you were looking forward

1041
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:36,120
to playing folks in Europe, if you're in the US, sorry, can't do it in Army of Two.

1042
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:41,180
Some people are pretty pissed off about this, but in a way, I kind of wonder, is it maybe

1043
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,960
because the lag is too great, because aren't these supposed to be some huge multiplayer

1044
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,480
matches, and if you have one person that's far away like that, it would cause a tremendous

1045
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,480
amount of lag?

1046
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,160
They were saying it's just a save on server strain, because Army Two's going to be the

1047
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,960
uber-awesome game or something, so you know.

1048
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:03,160
I don't know, I still wish they would leave that option open, but maybe it's not the default

1049
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,080
way to assign the players.

1050
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,240
But if you really wanted to play against somebody in the UK or overseas or whatever, you should

1051
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,240
be able to.

1052
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,040
It's just EA, it's broken, whatever.

1053
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,680
I hope this isn't a trend, that's all I have to say.

1054
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,720
Well, I hope not.

1055
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:32,680
For fans of PopCap, there's actually going to be a PopCap hits release, a second one

1056
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:40,600
actually, that's going to have Heavy Weapon and Zuma on PS2 on a single disc.

1057
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,280
So if you like to get your casual games, I imagine it's going to be dirt cheap.

1058
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,280
20 bucks.

1059
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,280
That's not bad.

1060
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
$19.95.

1061
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,040
That's about the same price you'd pay for them on Xbox Live.

1062
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,680
Yeah, of course you can probably play them free online, but hey.

1063
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,240
But then you don't get all those extra features.

1064
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,240
That's true.

1065
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,120
New boards, new puzzles, new everything.

1066
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,560
I kind of liked Heavy Weapon, it was a fun game.

1067
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:03,640
Zuma, Zuma, I'm a little burned out on Zuma.

1068
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,000
I haven't played Zuma.

1069
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,520
It's just fun, but I'm a little burned out on it, but Heavy Weapon was cool.

1070
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,520
There you have it.

1071
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,760
I like anything with weapon in the title.

1072
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,920
All right, we're going to be opening the Skype line very soon for you guys, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1073
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,680
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, that's going to be opening very soon.

1074
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,960
I just want to read a couple of quick comments from chat.

1075
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,840
Karpatkin is in chat, he has his own show, or co-host a show over on All Games, and I

1076
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,160
happen to know because of that that he's in the UK and he says it has to do with P2P network

1077
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:42,080
play, not servers in regards to Army of Two, so hmm, interesting.

1078
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:47,240
Let's go to the phones, if you want to give us a call again, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username

1079
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,240
on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1080
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,880
The phone lines are now open.

1081
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,880
Give us a call.

1082
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,880
We'll be waiting.

1083
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,680
In the meantime, we have a, oh, we got a call.

1084
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1085
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Who's this?

1086
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Oh, hi.

1087
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
This is RossdielUT.

1088
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Well, hello, RossdielUT.

1089
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
What's on your mind?

1090
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:14,080
Well, one thing, I want to go back to Microsoft's decision about not supporting Blu-ray and touting

1091
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:21,960
their online service, I really think they're limiting their potential audience by doing

1092
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,600
that, honestly.

1093
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:31,400
You know, since, like it or not, a whole lot of Americans either can't or don't want to

1094
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,720
download movies, especially on their shitty-ass DRM service.

1095
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,960
Wait, wait, I've got to ask, what is it about Microsoft's service you don't like?

1096
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,160
Well, I think I told you about what happened to me with my XBLA games.

1097
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,880
Oh, when you had to send your thing back, you had to redownload them all and all that?

1098
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,800
I had to redownload them again, then I had to, well, I didn't have to redownload them,

1099
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:58,320
but the way the DRM works is that you can't access your content offline, like if your

1100
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,560
internet goes on the fritz.

1101
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,560
Right, that's right.

1102
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,560
Okay.

1103
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:06,760
I mean, I've heard common problems about that, and the same goes for movies, basically.

1104
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:14,800
Well, movies, you don't even get to keep the movies, you can only watch them once.

1105
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,880
And no, Rama, the PlayStation Network isn't anywhere near as draconian.

1106
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:24,680
You can activate up to five systems, and it's not anywhere near as hard to get things revalidated.

1107
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,040
Okay, I've got to read the comment from chat that you responded to for the sake of our

1108
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,840
podcast listeners who don't see chat.

1109
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,120
Rama said, shitty, yes, but it's better than the PlayStation Network.

1110
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:37,360
All right, so Microsoft's not doing Blu-ray.

1111
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,000
You think that's a decision that makes sense, or you think it's going to hurt them in the

1112
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,520
long run?

1113
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,160
I think it's going to hurt them in the long run.

1114
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:49,520
I think what we forget, being in cities, you know, you're in Sacramento, I'm in Miami,

1115
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:57,000
I'm sure a lot of the people in the chat are from decent-sized cities, is that large parts

1116
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:04,240
of the country, especially the further west you go until you get to California, broadband

1117
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,240
isn't as easily available, or it's very expensive.

1118
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:13,120
I mean, not only that, but most people are going to have common customer-grade DSLs.

1119
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:19,360
They're not going to be paying $80 a month for the high-end stuff, you know what I mean?

1120
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,240
But don't you think that in those places, those are the places where Blockbuster and

1121
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:27,840
Hollywood Video and Movie Gallery and all those places are still doing well?

1122
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,680
Well, they're still doing well here in Miami.

1123
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,840
There's a Blockbuster right in front of my house.

1124
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,640
That place is always doing great business.

1125
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,640
They're still doing well in cities.

1126
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:43,120
You still see the mom-and-pop stores anymore.

1127
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,080
I used to work, my very first job was at a mom-and-pop video game store, and they went

1128
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,360
under years ago.

1129
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:53,480
Well, that has more to do with the chains, you know, bullying everybody out than anything

1130
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,480
else.

1131
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,240
That's a whole other issue we could spend a whole show doing.

1132
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:02,320
I'll just say, though, we had one thing that Hollywood and Blockbuster and all them didn't

1133
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
have.

1134
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,320
We rented porn.

1135
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,760
So, you know, how they went out of business on the road.

1136
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,240
You still see places that run porn, West Coast and things like that, you know, chains here

1137
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,480
in the Southeast.

1138
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:19,160
But when you go download only, you're limiting yourself because, let's face it, if you want

1139
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:30,280
to download something other than a damn act up to saying it pretty much, I mean, one megabit

1140
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,080
connection is 40 bucks.

1141
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:36,880
That's not going to get you a high definition movie in a reasonable amount of time.

1142
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,520
I go to Xbox Live Arcade, it takes like an hour to download a movie.

1143
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:48,680
The downloading thing doesn't do a lot for our need-it-now kind of culture, the self-gratification

1144
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,120
culture that we live in.

1145
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:54,320
The reason why Blockbuster and all that do well is because when somebody thinks, I want

1146
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,200
to rent a movie, they want to rent a movie tonight, now.

1147
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,640
They don't want to wait for Netflix.

1148
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,160
They don't want to wait to download it.

1149
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,160
They want to go get it now.

1150
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:09,000
Even Netflix, I mean, if you keep a steady queue, you always have a movie or two there.

1151
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,720
But what if the one that's at your house isn't necessarily, and don't get me wrong, I love

1152
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,040
Netflix, I'm just being devil's advocate, what if the one at your house right now isn't

1153
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:21,000
the one that you end up wanting to watch when you're talking about with friends, maybe you're

1154
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
talking about an old classic 80s movie that nobody has?

1155
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,240
At the end of the day, you get in the car and you go to Blockbuster.

1156
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:34,280
You get in the car or if you're lucky enough like I am, you walk across the street and

1157
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:38,080
there's your Blockbuster, you pick up your movie.

1158
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,060
With Blu-ray, you're going to be able to do that.

1159
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:45,360
In the coming months, we already have Blu-ray for rental in my place and you're going to

1160
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,360
see that all over the place.

1161
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,760
We're going to see Blu-ray rentals all over the place and it's just going to take over.

1162
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,760
Well, we'll see.

1163
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,200
Ross, to you, too, we've got to wrap up.

1164
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,200
We're getting towards time.

1165
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,320
Any other last minute thoughts?

1166
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:02,240
One last minute thing, I'm surprised you guys didn't talk about the NPDs this month.

1167
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,400
What specifically about them?

1168
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:14,040
The PS3 outsold the 360 for the second month in a row, selling 281,000 units versus 255,

1169
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,120
but what really surprised me was how well the PS2 did.

1170
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,600
I don't know if you saw this.

1171
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,340
It sold 352,000.

1172
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,160
That's pretty typical for the PS2.

1173
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,160
It's actually the matching.

1174
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,080
I was about to say, doesn't everybody have it?

1175
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,080
It's still the spare bedroom system.

1176
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,240
It's the system you buy for the younger kids so they can feel cool because they have a

1177
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,880
video gaming system in their room.

1178
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,080
I think most folks like us that listen to programs like this, we all have PS2s at this

1179
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,080
point.

1180
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,080
It's not just us.

1181
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,800
The system has already sold 50 million in America alone.

1182
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,600
And the only reason the PS3 outsold the 360 is because the 360 is in a shortage right

1183
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,600
now.

1184
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
Oh, please.

1185
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,640
Every store I go to there's a ton of 360s.

1186
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,640
Microsoft is making a shortage.

1187
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:01,320
Well, I know because I talked to Microsoft that there's a fucking shortage going on right

1188
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,600
now and they, in fact, commented, yeah, there is a shortage going on right now.

1189
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,280
We know that the PlayStation 3 is going to outsell us this month and sure enough then

1190
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,920
that's not just damage control.

1191
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,600
It's not damage control because they're going to have enough, oh right, yeah, okay, I'm

1192
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:19,240
sure all of a sudden Blu-ray wins now and they're going to sell billions of systems

1193
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,240
and they'll be the number one.

1194
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,980
Well, actually I was kind of thinking like couldn't the possibility because now that

1195
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:26,520
Blu-ray has won the war, so to speak, maybe that moves some PS3s.

1196
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,520
Not going to fucking happen.

1197
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,680
I bet you anything in April that the 360 is definitely going to outsell a PS3 and buy

1198
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,680
a lot.

1199
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:33,680
What kind of bet?

1200
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,680
Shut up.

1201
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,680
I don't know.

1202
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,680
It's worth a try.

1203
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:43,840
It's not so much just Blu-ray but ever since we saw the system go down to the 399 with

1204
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,320
the 40 gig, you know, the sales have picked up.

1205
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,720
Yeah, and Sony is really confident on that.

1206
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,720
You know why?

1207
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,440
Because now they're removing the Blu-ray movie that comes with it because they're,

1208
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,320
guess what, fuckers will buy your own Blu-ray.

1209
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,480
All right, I got to wrap it up, you guys, I'm supposed to keep it in the four minutes

1210
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,000
and we're on seven, but Ross Steel, UT, thank you for your perspective as always.

1211
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Take care, buddy.

1212
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Okay, bye-bye.

1213
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Bye-bye.

1214
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
You know, I do like this comment from SSJ100Matt in chat, he says, fact, HDTV needs to be the

1215
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,200
standard before Blu-ray can really take off.

1216
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,200
I agree.

1217
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,080
But in 2009 with that whole digital TV switchover, I see there's a distinct possibility.

1218
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,320
I think this holiday season is huge for HDTVs.

1219
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,320
Yeah, exactly.

1220
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,140
This holiday is going to be awesome and, you know, but the fact is there is a shortage

1221
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,600
on systems right now, I know that from, you know, working a retail standpoint and from

1222
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,600
Microsoft actually calling.

1223
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,600
All right, all right, let's go to a new call, breathe in.

1224
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,680
All right, new call, hi, you're on Horse House Radio, who's this?

1225
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,680
Hi, this is Act Deft.

1226
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,360
Hi, Act Deft, what's on your mind?

1227
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,360
Hello.

1228
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,160
Oh, I just wanted to comment about video games live.

1229
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:49,640
Oh, that's right, you got to go and the concert just happened in Mexico recently, right?

1230
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,640
Yeah.

1231
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,640
And how was it?

1232
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:57,400
Oh, it was so fucking epic and amazing.

1233
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,520
It was everything I expected and more.

1234
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:07,400
It was a pretty amazing, how do you say it, show, yeah.

1235
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,680
Describe for us like the best part.

1236
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:17,800
I seriously can't choose the best part, though if I had to choose a song they played, maybe

1237
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:25,840
it was the Kingdom Hearts theme song, sampling clean, an orchestra, oh, it was so fucking

1238
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,840
amazing.

1239
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Nice.

1240
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,640
You sound like you were blown away.

1241
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,640
How was this?

1242
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,520
Yeah, I almost cried at that part.

1243
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,360
How was the audience?

1244
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,620
Was there a lot of people there?

1245
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,840
Was it a very full house or?

1246
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:50,680
Well, not a full house, though approximately like 2,000 people and maybe, well, the Bull

1247
01:08:50,680 --> 01:09:00,920
Ring maybe has 5,000 people capacity and it was like 2,000 approximately, more or less.

1248
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:05,080
So it was, there was a lot of people, though it was not full.

1249
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,760
Okay, not too bad though.

1250
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:11,500
Sounds like a pretty filled up crowd, if nothing else.

1251
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,380
Did they give an indication that they might come back?

1252
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:18,960
This might just be the first of several shows in Mexico?

1253
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:25,920
They said in a conference before that they may or most probably will come next year again.

1254
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,920
Oh, nice.

1255
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,560
I bet you're excited about that.

1256
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,560
Yeah, pretty excited.

1257
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,920
Any advice you would have to give to folks that are going to be attending future video

1258
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,920
game live shows?

1259
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:43,440
Pretty much that any seat in the concert will give you a pretty good view, though on the

1260
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,760
front will be a pretty good show.

1261
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,160
All right, very awesome.

1262
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:53,480
Well, I'm glad to hear you had a really good time at the show and you know what's funny?

1263
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,320
I still have yet to see video games live.

1264
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,080
I just keep missing it every time it's in town, like something else is going on.

1265
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,080
It's sad.

1266
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,080
I really want to see it.

1267
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,200
I saw The Dear Friends, which is similar.

1268
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,160
I saw the Final Fantasy based one a while ago, but I will definitely catch video games

1269
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:10,080
live next time I can, especially because I hear nothing but good things about it, so

1270
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,080
I'll have to check it out.

1271
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,640
Akdefta, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1272
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,680
Just an article on Joystick.

1273
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,520
It was a report on Mexican game industry.

1274
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:30,200
They said that by 2010, the gaming industry in Mexico will increase by approximately I

1275
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,520
think 10 million, 10 billion, excuse me.

1276
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:43,360
So apparently it's going to be increasing, though I find it kind of ironic that even

1277
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:50,280
though the analysts think that it's going to increase in the economy, Mexico is one

1278
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:59,640
of the leading markets in the world of piracy, games, music, movies, you name it.

1279
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:11,120
So I don't know how the industry will manage to beat that.

1280
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:15,080
Interesting perspective from somebody who's actually there in Mexico.

1281
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,480
Sometimes we read these stories and we don't really know what is.

1282
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:22,520
I guess my question for you is what is the gaming, actually let me ask you this, have

1283
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,960
you ever visited the US?

1284
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:26,960
Yes I have.

1285
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,440
Have you been able to kind of compare like the availability and the prevalence of gaming

1286
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,920
here in the US versus Mexico?

1287
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:44,020
Well, like in the United States you have GameStop, Baby Games, many video game stores here.

1288
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:52,800
We only have maybe one or two game stores and they're only located on the southern region

1289
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,920
of the country.

1290
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:04,280
Most of the stores that carry games are like supermarkets like Walmart, for example, and

1291
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:09,480
they don't have a great library of games, so it's pretty difficult to find a game you

1292
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,480
like.

1293
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,860
Where do you get your games from?

1294
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:19,160
I actually get my games from Sam's Club because they are pretty cheap and they have a great

1295
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,160
library there.

1296
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:26,720
So I'm kind of liking that, but anywhere else I go I cannot find anything.

1297
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:34,120
So I actually have to get my games from online or I have to ask friends that go to the United

1298
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,880
States to get them from me.

1299
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,680
To get them from you, well thankfully they run on the same televisions and pretty much

1300
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,160
the Xboxes you get there are the same ones here so you don't have to worry about those

1301
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,560
region-based issues.

1302
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,120
Always interesting to hear from our listeners in other countries and kind of hear about

1303
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,560
the way the scene is there.

1304
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,560
So thanks so much.

1305
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,840
We've got to let you go active because we're running out of time, but thank you very much

1306
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,840
for the call.

1307
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,360
Yeah, thank you too.

1308
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,360
Take care.

1309
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,880
We'll do one more call.

1310
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,200
We'll see who gets through here.

1311
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,200
We'll do some last minute stories.

1312
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,640
Do you have any last minute stories for us, Loki, when we get to that?

1313
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,640
Yeah.

1314
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,640
All right, sounds good.

1315
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,320
Why don't you go ahead and read us the first one because...

1316
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,320
Oh, no, never mind.

1317
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,320
We've got a call.

1318
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,240
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1319
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,240
Who's this?

1320
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,520
Hello, Orange Lounge.

1321
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:23,640
This is the, what is it, the Norwegian, no, Norwegian, Swedish owl known as Akkeriper.

1322
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,720
Well, hello, Akkeriper.

1323
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,800
I see you in chat right now.

1324
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,840
I remember you calling in before.

1325
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,480
How are you doing?

1326
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,720
I'm doing just fine.

1327
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:38,920
I'm, well, what, doing my wow drugs as usual, so...

1328
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,920
What time is it?

1329
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,680
It's got to be like, what, four or five in the morning over there?

1330
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:53,400
It's like, what is it, five, five to, ah, I don't know, damn, I'm lost.

1331
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,500
It's around like five o'clock in the morning.

1332
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,880
He's up so late, he lost complete track of time.

1333
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,880
That's dedication.

1334
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,880
I love it.

1335
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,880
Well, what's on your mind?

1336
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,880
What do we owe the phone call tonight?

1337
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,920
Yeah, well, what is it?

1338
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:11,160
I'm in the plans of buying a PSP for some weird reason, and I don't even know why, but

1339
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:18,720
the reason is that I want to do a home brew on it, and I try to do some read up on it

1340
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:24,920
on the web, and I'm completely lost on that front for some weird reason.

1341
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:34,680
I don't even know why, but, well, and since, what is it, since Loki has made his home brew

1342
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:42,640
PSP, I think, if I remember right, I want to ask him, what is, what is, does he have

1343
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,560
any kind of tip or so, what is so?

1344
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,560
Good question.

1345
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,360
What is kind of the best way, if you're interested in doing some home brew on the PSP, what's

1346
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,160
the best way to do that if you don't already own a PSP?

1347
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:56,520
It's not very easy, because, especially with the new slim PSPs now, if you're getting one

1348
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:01,620
of the fatter ones, it's easy to do it, because all you have to really do is, you know, up

1349
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:07,020
downgrade the, you know, using any sort of exploit, either the Pandora's battery or

1350
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,660
Grand Theft Auto, or Let me, let me say this first, I think part

1351
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:13,360
of the reason it's so complicated is because of the fact that Sony keeps patching it with

1352
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,880
every exploit that's found, it seems like there's 50 different ways to do it out there,

1353
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,800
so Well, yeah, and really

1354
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:26,840
One of the, pardon me, one of the reasons also is that there is actually a place where

1355
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:37,320
you can buy a home brew enabled PSP for, what is it, like 2000 Swedish crowns, and you can

1356
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:51,320
also buy an standard vanilla PSP for like 1600, and well, since I'm a sheep bastard,

1357
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:56,800
I have the intention of just buying the vanilla, and then try to make some home brew version.

1358
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,420
I don't blame you, I don't blame you for being a PSP.

1359
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:03,240
There's guys online to do the slim PSP, but what it's going to really take is you need

1360
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:09,320
to have someone else that has one of the original PSPs, or has already made a Pandora's battery

1361
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,800
for the slim one, and basically what you do, you have to have the old one to create the

1362
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:19,120
Pandora's battery, then you patch it for the slim one, and then you run it on your slim.

1363
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,520
Should he try his luck and try to go buy a used PSP?

1364
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,080
I would think the cheapest way to do it, try your luck in buying a used PSP, because a

1365
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:32,120
used PSP is likely to have an older firmware still on it, depending on how long it's been

1366
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,240
on the shelf, and that way you can make sure you get a fat PSP, too, and then you can use

1367
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:44,320
either the Grand Theft Auto exploit, which still works, or this Pandora's battery thing,

1368
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,040
but that's an extra cost to it, isn't it, because you have to buy a whole other battery?

1369
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,040
Sort of.

1370
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,040
You can buy the...

1371
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,720
Okay, really quickly, what is the Pandora's battery?

1372
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:59,120
Pandora's battery is basically you're running firmware or actual code off the battery, because

1373
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,960
the battery itself actually has a little bit of data on it, and so what that does is it

1374
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:09,640
pops it into a developer's mode and drops the firmware to whatever.

1375
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:16,440
It basically resets the whole PSP, and what they've done is kind of bootstrapped a downgrader

1376
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:22,720
with this Pandora's battery, so it's allowed them to drop it down to 1.5, and then once

1377
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:28,120
you have 1.5, you can up it to a custom firmware or something like that.

1378
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:32,880
It's not easy, and it's pretty confusing, but there are guides that take you step by

1379
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,960
step on how to do it.

1380
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:41,760
QJNet has a pretty good guide and stuff, or at least they have links to find a guide like

1381
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,760
that.

1382
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,240
I was just going to ask, are there any sites that you would recommend?

1383
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:54,520
Because it sounds like probably like PSP Hacks or psp.qj.net, or I think pspupdates.qj.net,

1384
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,880
they would have links.

1385
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,280
That's where I found mine, but it's been a long time since I did it.

1386
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,640
Once you do get a custom firmware on there, it's pretty easy, because now the stuff that

1387
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:11,400
they put out, I guess it's the M33 firmwares, they're completely easy to upgrade.

1388
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:18,040
In fact, now they've got a built-in where you can just run an update via Wi-Fi and update

1389
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:22,080
it over the web just like you would a normal psp.

1390
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,760
It's pretty simple once you've got that working to get a homebrew on there.

1391
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,520
Just getting it to that is pretty hard.

1392
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:34,720
Luckily, I had two psps, so I just used my old one to create the Pandora's Battery to

1393
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:38,720
do it.

1394
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:45,920
What is more, in that way, that was just about what we were going to ask also.

1395
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:54,360
Since you can actually buy one with custom firmware already on it, how will it work when

1396
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,920
you're going to have to do updates and stuff?

1397
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:11,720
Well, I think I know the name of the game, but not LocoRoco, but the other one that's

1398
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,720
coming.

1399
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,720
Padawan?

1400
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:19,560
Yeah, what you're going to have to do, obviously you can't use any updates that are on UMD

1401
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:24,440
disk, because that will corrupt your firmware, but what you're going to have to do is wait

1402
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,840
for them to release these updates.

1403
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:31,640
But luckily though, most of the firmwares are cracked within a day or two at the most.

1404
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,560
Here's kind of the sad part though, is that if you want to do homebrew on the psp, it's

1405
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,840
at the point now where you have to be pretty on top of it to do it.

1406
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,320
Loki, and here's something to consider, is that yeah, Loki might be a sort of homebrew

1407
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,200
psp expert, but Loki, how many psps do you own?

1408
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,200
Two.

1409
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,040
And one is for homebrew and one is for current stuff, right?

1410
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,040
Or something like that?

1411
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,040
No.

1412
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,040
Oh, I thought that's how you did it.

1413
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,880
One I just don't use, and it's collecting dust, and it's one of the older ones, and the

1414
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,600
other one is I can play new games on it, and I can play homebrew on it.

1415
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,600
Oh wow.

1416
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,960
It's the Slims, yeah.

1417
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,360
And you did the Pandora's Battery trick with it.

1418
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,360
Yeah.

1419
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,360
Oh, okay.

1420
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,360
It was a pain in the ass though.

1421
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:09,320
It was really not fun, and luckily I had like an extra battery I bought, because I bought

1422
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:13,920
a charger, a new charger for it, and it came with a battery, so I used that battery.

1423
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,680
In fact, I think I still have my Pandora's Battery, but the thing is, also when you're

1424
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:23,640
doing the Slim, the patched one does not fit on a 32 meg memory stick, so you need to make

1425
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:28,080
sure you have at least one that's like 128 to be able to put the data on it, because

1426
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:32,360
you have to have a memory stick and a battery that are basically linked together, and so

1427
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:36,560
what will happen is when you pop that battery in, it will run that data that's on that memory

1428
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,480
stick for you.

1429
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,480
It's really weird.

1430
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:44,000
Yeah, well, a memory card's not going to be a problem, since I actually have two memory

1431
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,760
sticks, and I actually plan to buy it on an 8 gig version if I'm going to buy a PSP, so.

1432
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,760
Yeah.

1433
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,760
That's fine.

1434
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,240
So why say another battery or something, I mean, what will happen is once you've created

1435
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:03,120
as a Pandora's Battery, it will, you can update your, or I guess back up your battery data

1436
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,200
so that you can drop that battery back to a normal battery after it's done.

1437
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,520
It's kind of complicated, there's a lot of stuff on the internet, unfortunately I don't

1438
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:17,200
remember exactly the steps to go to do it, but the information's definitely out there.

1439
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:23,320
I was going to say, if you're really lazy, you might be able to find a Pandora's Battery

1440
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,320
on eBay.

1441
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:29,880
One last question, though, about playing with a PSP Slim on a big screen, how does that

1442
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,760
work, or something?

1443
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:38,160
Well, the Slim ones, you just need to buy a cable to do it, and pretty much it just

1444
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,320
involves you plugging it in.

1445
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,000
The only problem is you're tethered to your TV, so.

1446
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,320
You need an extension or something like that, I guess?

1447
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:51,880
Any extension cable for component or composite will work, it's just you're still tethered

1448
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:56,680
to via a cord, although now they have a thing where they're going to come out with a remote

1449
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:01,440
dock if they're watching UMD movies or something like that that you can control it with a remote,

1450
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,760
but still, though, it's going to be tethered to your TV.

1451
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:08,960
Okay, Ripper, you're right, I've got to wrap things up, but do you have any other quick

1452
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,520
final thoughts?

1453
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,920
Nah, not that of so.

1454
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:23,400
I'm just a bit annoyed, just waiting for a 2.4 patch to come out, since apparently you

1455
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:31,120
can start downloading the whole thing, so on Tuesday or Wednesday it's going to apparently

1456
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,620
be patched to 2.4.

1457
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:37,000
The background downloader is already active, my 2.4 is downloaded, I'm pretty sure it'll

1458
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,960
go live either this Tuesday or next Tuesday, but we'll see, and of course we're talking

1459
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,080
about Warcraft if you're going anywhere.

1460
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:45,520
Hey, real quick, you said you were from Sweden?

1461
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,520
Yeah.

1462
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,480
Now, you know what I love most about Sweden?

1463
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,920
I don't know, our royal house?

1464
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,160
No, no.

1465
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,160
ABBA.

1466
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,160
Oh, yeah.

1467
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,160
Oh, yeah.

1468
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,160
Don't stop.

1469
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,160
I love the music.

1470
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,160
All right.

1471
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,160
I seriously got to let you go.

1472
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,160
Yeah, well, I can't say.

1473
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,160
No, I know.

1474
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,160
That was how many years ago, but it's timeless.

1475
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,160
Yeah, I did.

1476
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,160
All right.

1477
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,160
Have a good one, buddy.

1478
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,160
Thank you.

1479
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,160
Bye.

1480
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,160
Bye.

1481
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,160
Bye.

1482
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,160
Bye, buddy.

1483
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,160
Thank you.

1484
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,160
That's it.

1485
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,160
Same to you too.

1486
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,160
Bye.

1487
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,160
And of course the chat room's all, not ABBA.

1488
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:25,360
Since J-100 Matt says Rob went there, oh yes, I went there.

1489
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,040
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1490
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,280
We got to wrap up the show.

1491
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,280
Mm-hmm.

1492
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,280
Good times.

1493
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,280
I'm sorry, Jamie.

1494
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,920
But ABBA, Jamie, ABBA.

1495
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,760
I remember when you were all antsy about getting to see Mamma Mia.

1496
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,840
Hey, the movie is coming out.

1497
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,840
I'll tell you what, I'm excited.

1498
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,840
All right.

1499
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:41,840
I can't wait to see it.

1500
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,840
All right.

1501
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,840
We got to wrap up.

1502
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,840
Let's get everybody's final thought.

1503
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,320
Dark Soccer, you got like your keys in your hand.

1504
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,320
You're ready to roll, Dark Soccer.

1505
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,960
No, I'm trying to get to my thing so I can give you my cage match song.

1506
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:50,960
No, I'm kidding.

1507
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,080
What's your final thought today?

1508
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:56,260
Reject false icons and buy me a fucking computer, buddy.

1509
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:58,040
My final thought is heartburn sucks.

1510
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,120
Loki, your final thought?

1511
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:08,280
My final thought is, I don't know, I got to add people in Smash Brothers Brawl, I guess.

1512
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:12,520
And Dark Tetsuya needs to add me on his Wii console so I can send him levels because he

1513
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,040
was bitchy and they couldn't download any because he doesn't have an SD memory card,

1514
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,360
which are dirt cheap by now.

1515
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,760
I should let you know.

1516
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:22,040
By the way, speaking of custom levels, I heard you broke some type of record or something?

1517
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,160
Well, I didn't break a record, but my level is in the top 20 downloadable levels for...

1518
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,160
Ooh!

1519
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,160
Out of how many levels?

1520
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,160
20?

1521
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,160
No, quite a few, actually.

1522
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,160
Wow, good for you.

1523
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,160
Congrats.

1524
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,920
Are you selling the show somehow?

1525
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,000
I made one and no one liked that level.

1526
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Oh, dope.

1527
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
What's the trick?

1528
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,040
The trick is to make stuff that looks like other things from pixel art type stuff, levels

1529
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,040
that look like...

1530
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:49,440
Mine was the question block level, so it looks like a question block from Mario Brothers.

1531
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,440
Gotcha.

1532
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,440
All right.

1533
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,240
I have one other final thought for you guys.

1534
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:56,760
Oh, but before we get to that, I just want to say thank you so much, as always, for tuning

1535
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,680
into and downloading and supporting independent podcasting.

1536
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:03,440
Remember, if you like Orange Launch Radio, all we ask, tell a friend or two about our

1537
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,440
show.

1538
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,440
Spread the word.

1539
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,240
It's how we slowly take over the world.

1540
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:14,240
And I'll leave you with one last final, final thought, and then say good night.

1541
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:24,080
Good night.

1542
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,720
That music will never, ever get old.

1543
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,720
Erasure did a good cover.

1544
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:31,200
I don't care what you say.

1545
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,200
Thank you guys again.

1546
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,200
Have a great week.

1547
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:53,840
See you next time here on Orange Launch Radio.
