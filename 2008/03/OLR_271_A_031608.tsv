7000	12000	There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco
14000	19000	Tonight, March 16th, 2008, Tetris and Bomberman are WiiWare bound,
19000	22000	E! Amuse hits the DDR scene in North America,
22000	26000	and are the rumors about a Blu-ray drive on the 360 true?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that program on the internet, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week, also here with you every week, the one and only, Dark Sakura.
47000	48000	Jamie Summers.
48000	49000	Hi.
49000	50000	How are you, Miss Summers?
50000	54000	I'm completely enamored with what I'm looking at.
54000	55000	What are you looking at, Preto?
55000	56000	A melodica.
56000	59000	A melodica. Are you shopping for musical instruments online tonight?
59000	60000	Yes, I am.
60000	67000	Did last week's techno didgeridoo inspire you to come up with an underappreciated instrument of your own?
67000	71000	Well, I actually have, there's a few instruments that I personally want to own myself.
72000	78000	One of them is a melodica, which is like a keyboard, but you play it like, with the mouthpiece.
78000	79000	Nice.
79000	82000	And so it sounds sort of like a harmonica, but not quite.
82000	87000	I also want an autoharp.
88000	89000	Fun.
89000	91000	Because I used to play autoharp when I was little.
91000	96000	What about Kazoo? Does Kazoo not satisfy anyone anymore? Is that the problem?
96000	97000	Not really.
97000	99000	My wife autoharps.
100000	103000	Say hello to the smartass over there, Tech Master Loki.
104000	105000	Hi.
105000	106000	So your wife autoharps, huh?
106000	107000	Yes.
107000	108000	That's nice to know.
108000	112000	I don't have to tell her to complain at all. She just does it on her own.
113000	116000	How are you? Oh, I get it. There's a joke in there.
118000	120000	And how are you otherwise this week, Tech Master Loki?
120000	121000	I'm okay.
121000	124000	Excellent. Are you shopping for any musical instruments of your own?
124000	125000	No.
125000	126000	Okay. Just checking.
127000	130000	Okay, well, let's get into how we always start off the show.
130000	134000	First, let me introduce the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
134000	136000	There's several people in chat tonight.
136000	140000	Kind of a smaller turnout, though, on the live stream than I've seen in recent weeks, so I'm not sure.
140000	142000	Is there something else going on tonight I'm not aware of?
143000	146000	No more Grammy Awards? No Oscars? No Super Bowl?
146000	147000	It's, I guess...
147000	149000	Go outside night?
149000	151000	St. Patty's Eve, I don't know.
151000	154000	Oh, maybe people are camping out outside the bars waiting for 6 a.m. I don't know.
155000	156000	All right, well, who knows?
156000	163000	Anyhow, we'll work with what we've got and also our little contingent over on Justin TV on our feed there,
163000	167000	which, by the way, brand new addition to our Justin TV arsenal.
167000	171000	We now have a video capture card, so when we bring you clips of games,
171000	174000	we'll actually, instead of having to point the camera at the TV, the little getaway,
174000	177000	we'll actually be able to run the feed from the TV.
177000	179000	That's very exciting. Happy, happy, happy.
179000	182000	All right, so anyhow, let's get into how we always start off the show.
182000	183000	How was your gaming week?
183000	185000	Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off? How was your gaming week?
186000	190000	My week was pretty sparse just because I've been so busy all week,
190000	197000	so all I played was Ragnarok, and we actually had to play a little pinball,
197000	202000	but we have a purchase that might be coming up in our game future.
202000	203000	Good time. What's that?
203000	207000	Stern is releasing a new Indiana Jones pinball machine,
207000	212000	and Dan said he'd even be willing to sell Creature of the Black Lagoon to obtain it.
212000	216000	Nice. So that's going to be expensive, though, a new machine?
216000	217000	A brand new machine.
217000	218000	You guys are crazy.
218000	221000	Well, he said he might even let go since his pinball party.
221000	224000	Wow. But, I mean, it is an Indiana Jones machine. That is kind of awesome.
224000	226000	It's a new Indiana Jones machine.
226000	227000	That is kind of awesome.
227000	229000	We actually have the old one in our garage right now.
229000	233000	I imagine it's to coincide with the new Kingdom of the Crystal Skull movie?
233000	236000	I do believe so. That would be quite likely.
236000	239000	Nice. That would be fun.
239000	241000	The pinball rules.
241000	244000	Anything else besides pinball and that stuff?
244000	245000	Ragnarok.
245000	248000	Ragnarok.
248000	249000	And Scrabble.
249000	252000	Have you been playing the Scrabble game on Facebook?
252000	254000	I don't go on Facebook.
254000	259000	Facebook has a very Scrabble-like game. In fact, I think they got in trouble for it.
259000	262000	It's actually an application called Scrabulous, is what it's called.
262000	265000	You can play Scrabble with friends on Facebook, basically.
265000	270000	And as much as Facebook kind of bugs me, I do like being able to play Scrabble with friends online.
270000	272000	I don't know if it's the same one.
272000	275000	It was something that was linked to me.
275000	278000	But I was doing the Solitaire mode on it.
278000	282000	I'm pretty sure you have to be a Facebook member to use Scrabulous, so it was probably something different.
282000	292000	I have a Facebook, but the last thing I actually did with it was through my phone when one of my friends in Mississippi found me in Facebook somehow and friended me.
292000	296000	You know, Jamie, I was just going to mention that I saw this earlier today than I thought of you guys.
296000	308000	Street Fighter IV, they're taking pre-orders on it right now. It's $2,590 with an $880 deposit for the arcade hardware.
308000	312000	Oh, for the machine? I was like, for the game? Oh.
312000	315000	Hmm.
315000	318000	But what kind of machine do you have to put that in?
318000	321000	Well, normally the machines are $23,000.
321000	326000	So, I mean, it's probably, you know, but, I mean, come on, 2DX?
326000	330000	I mean, shit, that's just like a computer with an HD screen attached to it and a sound system.
330000	336000	So, I mean, most of these things nowadays, you can probably hook it up to a TV and build your own control panel for it.
336000	338000	I don't think it's too sophisticated.
338000	340000	I mean, it's just a game.
340000	341000	You just have to be able to run the...
341000	343000	Yeah. It's just a game.
343000	350000	I mean, games, arcade games, haven't really changed too much as far as, like, okay, put coin in, you know, control panel, monitor.
350000	354000	That's it. Hooking that stuff up isn't that hard.
354000	361000	It's still not like where you could get one of those super guns and just hook it up to it, but, you know.
361000	364000	Well, let me know if you end up doing that, Jamie. That's pretty hardcore, but then again...
364000	365000	I doubt it.
365000	366000	Yeah.
366000	369000	But then again, I'm like, well, you are going to buy that Indiana Jones pinball machine.
369000	371000	Dan was talking about buying it.
371000	373000	Okay. Talking and doing are two different things. That is true.
373000	375000	I know, and he talks a lot.
375000	376000	Big talker.
376000	378000	I mean, wait.
378000	382000	Well, let's move on then to Loki before Dark Soccer gets yourself in trouble.
382000	393000	And I was going to say too, it says apparently it comes with a Street Fighter IV network ID card and some versus communication kit.
393000	397000	So you can actually play other people online using your kit if you bought it.
397000	402000	I don't know. If I only have $3,000 to throw around, of course I don't.
402000	405000	I probably wouldn't spend it on Street Fighter IV because I suck at Street Fighter.
405000	406000	Anyways.
406000	407000	What?
407000	409000	You know what I would do if I had that much money?
409000	412000	Make a down payment on a house and move.
412000	416000	You're going to need more than $3,000 for a down payment.
416000	419000	I was thinking, like, the cost of the cabinet.
419000	423000	Ah. Well, $23,000. I would cover it.
423000	428000	Now, this week I didn't play a whole lot. I just played basically N+.
428000	431000	A few lunches I played that.
431000	437000	So it's fun. It's just like N. I think I'm on the 10th level.
437000	440000	But there's like 5 or 6 stages per level.
440000	444000	Some of them are pretty hard, but that's N.
444000	455000	And then the rest of the time I've been playing Smash Bros., but I've just basically been doing the Space Emissary mode, which is varying levels of cool and crap.
455000	456000	I don't know.
456000	464000	Sometimes I'm just like, oh, this is pretty good level design, and some other times it's just like, uhhh, I don't know, this is pretty dumb.
464000	469000	But, overall, I'm still playing it and I'm only halfway through it.
469000	473000	Actually, a little over halfway through it.
473000	479000	But, other than that, I don't know. It's pretty good.
479000	481000	How was N+, overall?
481000	483000	That's what some folks in chat are asking.
483000	494000	N+, I like it, but it's not too different than just the regular N, except for the fact that, I don't know, different levels.
494000	496000	That's it.
496000	500000	Alright, well, moving on to my gaming week.
500000	508000	I've actually been kind of sick this week, which you would think would make me want to stay home and play a lot of games, but it kind of sucked my will to do a lot of things.
508000	511000	I've been having these weird pains all over my side.
511000	513000	Now I want to get into all the nasty details about it.
513000	519000	Basically, doctors don't even know what it is, and I've taken medications that have caused, now, side effects, blah, blah, blah.
519000	520000	It kind of sucks.
520000	523000	So, yeah, I didn't play a lot of games because of it.
523000	524000	I did play a few things.
524000	525000	Very random stuff.
525000	527000	Some of the things I played were very random.
527000	530000	I played Phantasy Star 2.
530000	536000	I decided to download on Virtual Console quite randomly, and I checked that out, and that was kind of cool.
536000	543000	Although, I don't know, Phantasy Star 2 wasn't quite as cool as Final Fantasy, but it was different.
543000	544000	It was kind of cool.
544000	548000	This is one of those games, because I never had a Genesis growing up, so it was kind of one of those games I missed.
548000	556000	It's kind of neat, though, now that I've played Phantasy Star online, to kind of see some of the history of the Phantasy Star universe and see where a lot of that stuff has come from.
556000	558000	So, that's kind of cool.
558000	560000	Let's see, what else have I checked out?
560000	562000	World of Warcraft, as always.
562000	564000	Addict and all that stuff.
564000	571000	Let's see, what else have I played this week?
571000	572000	I'm totally drawing a blank.
572000	574000	I actually skipped out on Lost Odyssey this week.
574000	579000	Oh, I checked out Brain Challenge, that new Xbox Live arcade game.
579000	581000	It was kind of dumb.
581000	583000	The minigames were kind of dumb.
583000	586000	The minigames were just kind of...
586000	588000	I don't know.
588000	595000	I guess if you don't have Brain Age on the DS, or I don't know, the whole novelty of these brain training games has really worn off, let's face it.
595000	597000	The market's been really oversaturated.
597000	601000	I guess this is the only type of it available on the Xbox 360.
601000	611000	If you must have a minigame collection for your very own on the Xbox 360, then you can go ahead and check that out.
611000	614000	But, honestly, it's really nothing to scream about.
614000	617000	So, that would be that.
617000	620000	That's really it for my gaming week.
620000	623000	All right, so moving on to housekeeping this week.
623000	629000	Not a lot that we have to say for housekeeping this week, other than, of course, as always, you can join our LiveJournal community.
629000	633000	At Orange Lounge is our LiveJournal community, or our MySpace is at Orange Lounge Radio.
633000	636000	Of course, we have our Facebook community, the OL Army.
636000	642000	You can join the social network and help pour out OLR to all your friends and your enemies, if you so choose.
642000	647000	But, of course, word of mouth is how we always spread the word about our show, so we always thank folks who choose to do that.
647000	653000	All right, we're having some technical problems in the studio right now, but hopefully things are on their way to being fixed.
653000	657000	It's just that, man, 2008 is just year of broken over here, year of fail.
657000	658000	I don't know what's up with that.
658000	663000	But, never mind, we're just going to try to proceed as normal.
663000	666000	And, Loki, if we can, we're going to start off the gaming news.
666000	676000	All right, so this week they officially announced that Super Mario Kart Wii will be coming to the U.S. on April 27th.
676000	679000	That is, two days before Grand Theft Auto IV.
679000	685000	But, hey, I mean, people on the Wii, they don't get Grand Theft Auto IV, so you get Mario Kart Wii.
685000	690000	No cars being stolen in this game, but, you know, it's still pretty violent.
690000	699000	Anyways, some other cool stuff that you'll, of course, get the Wii Wheel with this, and it will also be sold separately on the side.
699000	709000	Apparently, they're going to have, you know, 32 different courses, up to 12 players online, and Mii integration, 10 battle arenas,
709000	718000	and, of course, you know, support for a bunch of different control methods, much like Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
718000	720000	So, that's pretty awesome.
720000	722000	I plan on picking up both, though.
725000	729000	I noticed some of the retro levels are making an appearance in Mario Kart. That's kind of interesting.
729000	736000	Some of them are pretty cool. IGN actually had some footage of five levels that they had in their pre-release copy.
736000	739000	They're, I don't know what you'd call it, Alpha or whatever.
739000	747000	And, they've got Course 4 from the Super Nintendo Mario Kart, and that's pretty awesome looking.
747000	753000	Then, they had a remake of the Block Fort from Nintendo 64.
753000	757000	Although, it looks a little different, though. It's not just a direct, like, remake of it.
757000	761000	They've got a bunch of additional stuff on there, but it's still, you know, Block Fort.
761000	765000	And then, let's see, what else was there?
765000	767000	Some of the ones I didn't play, though.
767000	772000	They had one from the Game Boy Advance one, which I don't remember any of the battle modes in the Game Boy Advance one.
772000	779000	And, there's also some from, you know, Double Dash and the DS one.
779000	786000	But, to be honest, you know, Double Dash's battle mode kind of blew, and a DS I didn't play.
786000	789000	So, you know, at least the battle mode part of it.
789000	792000	But, it's your favorite part. How could you say that?
792000	799000	It is my favorite part, but I was so jaded after Double Dash, you know, that I just decided not to check it out on DS.
799000	802000	Alright, well, let's read some feedback in the chat room.
802000	806000	chat.orangeslaundryator.com, and we'll start off with a comment tonight from Jaded.
806000	810000	It says, between that and Brawl, I can say goodbye to my bank account.
810000	812000	I'm probably going to mispronounce this name, I apologize.
812000	815000	Queltipo? I think that's how I say it, Queltipo?
815000	820000	It says, the Wii wheel is about as useful as jamming the Wiimote into a giant pretzel.
820000	824000	And, you can do that, too, as long as the pretzel is sideways.
824000	828000	You can actually use a pretzel as a Wii steering wheel.
828000	830000	We should do that on the show, that'd be fun.
830000	831000	That might be kind of fun.
831000	833000	I was going to say, one thing that's not...
833000	834000	And delicious.
834000	837000	And delicious, yeah. Mmm, yummy!
837000	838000	I'm going to do that.
838000	844000	We can also do, like, the Wii Cinnabon and, you know, alternate controller methods.
844000	846000	That'd be sticky.
846000	847000	That would be kind of messy.
847000	850000	Use a hamburger bun. It's circular.
850000	855000	I was going to say, one thing that's not coming, though, to Mario Kart Wii is snaking.
855000	858000	And I know that I'm very happy about that.
858000	865000	Apparently, according to the official Nintendo magazine in the UK, snaking is gone.
865000	870000	They've changed how the boosting is done, I guess, around corners.
870000	876000	And no longer will you be able to speed boost by waggling the controls left and right as you power slide.
876000	883000	This has, I guess, been scrapped, and now your speed boost is determined by how long you can hold the slide.
883000	885000	I'm sure someone will find a different way to do it.
885000	887000	I'm sure it'll be exploited one way or another.
887000	889000	But, hey, that's kind of neat.
889000	895000	Of course, now, you know how our chat room works, and a little joke comes up, and then everybody exploits it best they can.
895000	900000	We've got Wii Chiro, Wii Tortilla, Wii Hot Dog Bun.
900000	902000	That actually kind of... Wii Hot Dog Bun?
902000	903000	That worked.
903000	905000	For Mario Kart controls.
905000	907000	What else did I want to read here?
907000	911000	SSG100Matt says, Mario Kart Wii looks like it's ripped from the arcade version.
911000	916000	I kind of hope not, because the arcade version, I don't know, it just doesn't have that same feel to me.
916000	921000	The arcade version feels, I don't know, it feels stripped of the magic.
921000	924000	So I take all the magic out of Mario Kart and you have the arcade version.
924000	925000	I don't know how to explain it.
925000	929000	You would think Mario Kart arcade would be, like, best thing ever, but it feels so generic when I play it.
929000	930000	I don't know.
930000	931000	Is it just me?
931000	935000	The only thing that was cool about that was the feature to take your picture.
935000	940000	But, obviously, they can't do that in, you know, on the Wii, because one, they don't have a camera, and two...
940000	941000	Well, that we know of.
941000	943000	I mean, it might be one of those things where, hey, guess what?
943000	948000	The Wii had a secret compartment the whole time that's been taking your picture.
948000	955000	It has, like, you know, then there'd be ass faces, you know, for racing in a Mario Kart.
955000	956000	I see what you did there.
956000	958000	A little joke from last week.
958000	959000	I got it.
959000	961000	All right.
961000	966000	Again, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelauncetradio.com.
966000	972000	You know, Mario Kart Wii isn't the only thing to get excited about this year if you're a Nintendo fan.
972000	977000	Reggie Fils-Aime is dropping some hints that there's a big holiday game coming out this year.
977000	978000	Of course.
978000	980000	I mean, obviously, every company's got to have their big holiday game.
980000	983000	It will be revealed at this year's E3.
983000	984000	That's right.
984000	988000	He mentioned this in an interview with Jeff Keighley on Game Trailers TV.
988000	996000	He says that the second half of 08's lineup will be announced at E3, which will probably include this year's big holiday title.
996000	997000	Who knows?
997000	1004000	Some things that Reggie was asked about, the orchestra conductor demo.
1004000	1009000	Remember that thing you saw at the very first E3 where the Wii showed up, which was the last E3 most of us went to?
1009000	1010000	Yeah, Wii Music.
1010000	1011000	Yeah.
1011000	1014000	Don't know if that's actually going to be a full game yet.
1014000	1019000	I mean, we did hear about that Wii Music game, but there was never any word if the conductor thing was a part of that.
1019000	1020000	It is, yeah.
1020000	1021000	Oh, is it?
1021000	1022000	Yeah, that's the game.
1022000	1024000	Oh, well, they asked him, Reggie, point blank about this, and Reggie said,
1024000	1027000	Who knows? Maybe that's one of the things we'll talk about at E3.
1027000	1029000	Kind of dodging the question.
1029000	1030000	Lame!
1030000	1033000	He also dodged a question about Donkey Kong Wii.
1033000	1035000	No, thanks.
1035000	1038000	I'm sorry, Donkey Kong Bunga Blast sucked enough.
1038000	1040000	I don't need another Donkey Kong game.
1040000	1048000	Reggie did say that all the E3 releases, or actually, sorry, post-E3 releases, will be, quote, maximizing all of our key franchises.
1048000	1055000	So you can bet it's going to be either like an F-Zero game, the Animal Crossing game, which most people are speculating.
1055000	1058000	I would bet it's the Animal Crossing game. It's going to be their big holiday title.
1058000	1059000	That's what I think.
1059000	1063000	And what other big franchises have they still got a milk?
1063000	1064000	Kirby?
1064000	1066000	They haven't really milked Kirby on the Wii yet, have they?
1066000	1067000	No.
1067000	1069000	They did milk Kirby on the DS, but not yet.
1069000	1076000	I think there's going to be some type of Animal Crossing that will have some nifty little online feature that's going to make everybody want it.
1076000	1078000	I say Animal Crossing Wii is their big title.
1078000	1082000	They better fucking release Excite Truck 2.
1082000	1084000	What if F-Zero was kind of Excite Truck-ish?
1084000	1086000	It's not.
1086000	1089000	I'm sorry, that's like saying wipeouts, you know, like, Excite Truck.
1089000	1090000	It's not.
1090000	1092000	It's just, eh.
1092000	1093000	It's too hard.
1093000	1096000	Dark Sakura, any thoughts on what the big title could be?
1096000	1098000	I was thinking about it.
1098000	1101000	And I am leaning toward Animal Crossing?
1101000	1102000	Mm-hmm.
1102000	1105000	Or possibly a Donkey Kong?
1105000	1114000	The problem that I had, because he said it's for the gamers, which makes you kind of think it might be something for more hardcore gamers, but also something that people would like to get into and stuff.
1114000	1120000	Animal Crossing, not really for the hardcore gamers, but that sounds feasible that they would do that.
1120000	1125000	And every single Animal Crossing game I've ever heard of has always come out around that time of the year.
1125000	1128000	So, you know, that'd be my guess.
1128000	1131000	And because they're whores like that and they would want to do that.
1131000	1143000	And now, especially once we get to that point in, you know, when that game is released, they'll have a perfect service for downloadable content and microtransactions and ooh, we can pour the hell out of that.
1143000	1144000	Yep, yep.
1144000	1146000	I'll tell you my Dark Horse candidate, though.
1146000	1152000	The game that, you know, maybe it's just hope that this would be their big announcement.
1152000	1157000	But I would say my Dark Horse candidate for the holiday game would be Kid Icarus on Wii.
1157000	1159000	But I don't know, I mean...
1159000	1162000	I think that's coming, but I don't think that's going to be it.
1162000	1164000	I have a feeling it's going to come back.
1164000	1166000	I mean, it just worked so well in Smash Brothers.
1166000	1173000	And like, I mean, you watch some of those cinematics and play some of those stages and you're like, God damn, they could put out a Kid Icarus game on the Wii and it would be awesome.
1173000	1177000	So, or as Act F says in chat, Kid Week-er-us.
1177000	1182000	New Mario RPG, that would be fucking awesome.
1182000	1183000	Yeah.
1183000	1184000	We'll see.
1184000	1186000	Let's see, some other comments from chat.
1186000	1191000	Devay in chat says, Microsoft took all the DK platformer game rights after they purchased Rare.
1191000	1194000	Odd1 says, yeah, it's probably Animal Crossing.
1194000	1197000	They said at the end of the anime movie that it'd be coming.
1197000	1203000	And it's also kind of one of those obvious things, like, someday there will be another Zelda game and another Mario game.
1203000	1206000	I just wish, though, that Nintendo would come up with a new franchise.
1206000	1208000	I'm all down with that, too.
1208000	1210000	I think they should come up with a new franchise.
1210000	1222000	Because it's nice, you know, that we get a new Mario game and a new Metroid game, but it's like, you know, you take all the surprise out of things because we know that there's going to be, every time you're going to put out a new system, there's obviously going to be a Mario game and that kind of stuff.
1222000	1230000	But, you know, it's like with, what, the PlayStation stuff, I guess there's always going to be a new Ratchet and Clank and that kind of crap, but I don't know.
1230000	1234000	Yeah, to be fair, Nintendo does seem to put out a few original IPs that do rather well.
1234000	1239000	I mean, let's see, they had the Donkey Kong bongo game, Pikmin.
1239000	1247000	They had, what else, I'm trying to think of the GameCube era that came out, I guess not Luigi's Mansion, I don't know.
1247000	1251000	But, you know, I don't know. I think it's possible for them to come up with some new stuff.
1251000	1253000	I mean, they've done it before.
1253000	1258000	WarioWare? Was that on GameCube? No, that started on Game Boy Advance, didn't it?
1258000	1260000	That was fun on GameCube, wasn't it?
1260000	1261000	It was pretty fun on the GameCube.
1261000	1265000	But, I mean, they're capable of churning out some new stuff once in a while when they really want to.
1265000	1267000	Wii Sports 2.
1267000	1270000	We're going to whore that franchise like a bitch.
1270000	1273000	Well, Wii Sports is kind of a new IP, right?
1273000	1277000	That could be a holiday title too, why not Wii Sports 2?
1277000	1280000	You know the soccer moms across America would eat that shit up.
1280000	1282000	Because they're going to whore it like a bitch, I'm trademarking that.
1282000	1287000	Alright, well, we'll see at this year's E3.
1287000	1291000	Well, for things that we said we would stop and wait and see on.
1291000	1295000	It looks like Manhunt 2 is getting a UK release after all.
1295000	1304000	According to the BBFC, they have no alternative but to give the 18 certificate to it.
1304000	1308000	Because, basically, I guess they were overruled.
1308000	1317000	It was actually twice rejected and it went up for review again and they said, okay, we have to.
1317000	1319000	So they finally just caved?
1319000	1321000	Pretty much.
1321000	1322000	That's kind of interesting.
1322000	1333000	It was actually, the video appeals committee gave it their own review and so because they've decided it should come out, it's going to come out.
1333000	1346000	You know, I guess I'm not too surprised by this but what kind of makes me think that maybe they finally decided to let it come out is maybe they saw what happened in America is that the game came out and nobody cared because the game kind of sucked.
1346000	1347000	Maybe.
1347000	1353000	I'm wondering if that didn't have an influence on it where they're like, well, I don't think it's really going to pollute the masses because the game kind of sucks.
1353000	1362000	No, they said that they were very unhappy with the appeal but they were basically strong armed into it.
1362000	1371000	I saw that they had a modified version for the Wii in case you have a mod ship and stuff with all the, you know, blurring crazy lighting gone.
1371000	1372000	Whatever.
1372000	1375000	Too bad the game sucks and, you know, it's not worth playing.
1375000	1384000	Do we have any, I know we don't have a whole lot of overseas listeners that listen live but are there any of our overseas listeners planning on purchasing this game overseas?
1384000	1385000	I bet I'm going to hear a lot of no's.
1385000	1386000	You don't want it.
1386000	1387000	Do yourself a favor.
1387000	1389000	But there's no release date announced for it yet.
1389000	1398000	If you want to see something like, if you want to play a game kind of like that, I guess, and more fun, maybe try the Godfather game and maybe No More Heroes.
1398000	1400000	Or just wait for something better.
1400000	1401000	There you go.
1401000	1402000	Even better.
1402000	1403000	Something better.
1403000	1404000	I like that.
1404000	1405000	Something better, the game.
1405000	1406000	That could be the new Nintendo IP.
1406000	1407000	Something better.
1407000	1408000	Something better.
1408000	1410000	You're going to buy it.
1410000	1411000	Yeah.
1411000	1419000	So we may be getting WiiWare in May but of course Japan being super awesome and everything.
1419000	1424000	They get it March 25th and they're going to be launching with quite a few games.
1424000	1437000	Right now they've got, of course, some of these I don't think we're getting but Okiraku Ping Pong Wii by Arc System for 500 points.
1437000	1446000	Word puzzle Mojipitan Wii for 1,000 points and I hear that one also has microtransactions too for little bonus puzzles that you can buy.
1446000	1447000	Oh, hooray.
1447000	1453000	Sakusaku Animal Panic by Konami for 1,000 points.
1453000	1454000	Star Soldier...
1454000	1456000	Wait, 4,000 points?
1456000	1457000	1,000 points.
1457000	1458000	Oh, I thought you said 4,000.
1458000	1459000	I'm like, fuck that.
1459000	1460000	Ain't worth buying that.
1460000	1461000	Ok.
1461000	1465000	Star Soldier R by Hudson for 800 points.
1465000	1472000	My Life as a King Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for 1,500 points.
1472000	1475000	Angel Solitaire by G-Mode for 500 points.
1475000	1480000	Dr. Mario and Baculous Extermination for 1,000 points.
1480000	1481000	I love that name.
1481000	1482000	Sounds painful.
1482000	1485000	Baculous.
1485000	1493000	Everybody's Pokemon Ranch for 1,000 points and Long Puss by Genki for 1,000 points.
1493000	1496000	Sounds not bad.
1496000	1497000	I don't know.
1497000	1499000	I'm kind of looking forward to the service.
1499000	1501000	It'll be interesting to see what kind of games are on there.
1501000	1502000	When are we supposed to be getting that here?
1502000	1503000	Did they say May?
1503000	1506000	It was like May 20 something.
1506000	1508000	I think May 20th or around that time.
1508000	1510000	So what's so special about these games?
1510000	1512000	What's going to make me want to purchase them?
1512000	1516000	I mean, what's interesting about it is that you won't really be able to play a demo.
1516000	1517000	Well, I don't know.
1517000	1522000	I guess we don't really know until the service launches in Japan what kind of secrets might be waiting, but you don't really get to play demos of the games.
1522000	1526000	Assuming it runs like Virtual Console, you don't get to really play a demo of the games.
1526000	1529000	You don't really play any of these games online with other people.
1529000	1531000	Or is that slowly going to be coming out?
1531000	1533000	You might be able to. I'm not sure.
1533000	1539000	And there's no achievements or leaderboards or anything we're hearing about.
1539000	1541000	What's the perk to get these games?
1541000	1543000	They're just more games.
1543000	1544000	I guess.
1544000	1551000	I mean, I guess maybe that's a stupid question because a lot of games that you might buy on the PC and stuff don't have a lot of those types of frills.
1551000	1553000	Especially the casual-type games.
1553000	1554000	But, you know, I don't know.
1554000	1562000	I think now in this day and age, part of the charms of having the online connections and online gaming is getting to somewhat compete with friends.
1562000	1567000	I really don't like the way that Nintendo handles their online, especially the friend stuff, the friend codes.
1567000	1569000	That's got to go.
1569000	1570000	Well, we'll see.
1570000	1576000	I mean, when the service actually launches in Japan, which is very, very soon, only about a week away.
1576000	1579000	Actually, we should know more details on next week's show, right?
1579000	1580000	Because they're a day ahead in Japan.
1580000	1581000	I would think so, yeah.
1581000	1583000	So we should know more next week's show.
1583000	1587000	Except today's the 16th and that would be the 23rd.
1587000	1588000	Oh, wait.
1588000	1589000	I can't do math.
1589000	1590000	I'm sorry.
1590000	1592000	Okay, then two weeks.
1592000	1594000	Two weeks will know more details.
1594000	1596000	All right.
1596000	1602000	Well, in the meantime, we do know some more details about some of the other games that will be coming out on the WiiWare.
1602000	1603000	One of them is Tetris.
1603000	1608000	Tetris Online will be coming on the WiiWare and you can play it with up to six players.
1608000	1616000	And I'm guessing since it's a matchup with Tetris Online, I'm guessing you can play up to six players online.
1616000	1619000	I'm looking at these screenshots, I see two different Miis.
1619000	1623000	Well, you would have to be able to play up to six players online since the Wii can only support up to four.
1623000	1624000	Oh, snap.
1624000	1627000	Well, technically you could do five because remember, was it Bomberman?
1627000	1630000	You could do the fifth one with the GameCube controllers, yeah.
1630000	1635000	So I'm assuming, yeah, some of these games are going to be online, which is a little better now.
1635000	1639000	So if you need another version of Tetris, you'll be able to play that on the Wii very soon.
1639000	1643000	One thing I want to point out, though, based on some of these screenshots I'm looking at that's kind of cool,
1643000	1648000	I'm looking at one particular two-player mode and it looks like the wells aren't separated.
1648000	1651000	It actually looks like the wells are combined into one giant well.
1651000	1657000	So I'm not sure if there's a two-player mode where maybe both players play one giant board at the same time.
1657000	1661000	That's kind of interesting, a different spin on a well-known formula.
1661000	1662000	Yeah.
1662000	1666000	It looks like this game might bring some new things to the table, which is a good thing.
1666000	1667000	You need Puzzle Fighter Wii.
1667000	1669000	I just asked about why I would need these types of games.
1669000	1670000	Puzzle Fighter Wii.
1670000	1672000	That'd be awesome with like Street Fighter IV characters.
1672000	1673000	You never know.
1673000	1676000	RasteelUT comments in the chat room, chat.orangewoncholster.com.
1676000	1681000	Ooh, Tetris, that's so new and independent.
1681000	1687000	Well, in a way, if you think about the history of Tetris, it actually is a very independent game at its roots,
1687000	1688000	but I mean, I get the point.
1688000	1689000	Obviously, it's not that anymore.
1689000	1692000	And people are still playing fucking Pac-Man Championship Edition.
1692000	1694000	That's just Pac-Man with neon lights.
1694000	1697000	I mean, that's all it fucking is.
1697000	1699000	But Pac-Man Championship Edition is kind of rad.
1699000	1700000	I don't know.
1700000	1701000	There's something about it.
1701000	1702000	And Pac-Man.
1702000	1705000	It's neon lights and rave music.
1705000	1709000	You know, all you need to do now is come out with like the Pac-Man DS system,
1709000	1712000	and all you whores will buy it like nothing.
1712000	1718000	Darkdetsuya comments in the chat room that, Rob, they actually had that mode that I'm describing there on Tengen Tetris.
1718000	1721000	Remember the Forbidden Tetris on the NES many years ago?
1721000	1722000	I have it.
1722000	1724000	That got cut up on a licensing debacle?
1724000	1727000	That would be even a better name for this online version.
1727000	1728000	Forbidden Tetris.
1728000	1731000	Forbidden Tetris.
1731000	1732000	I have Tengen Tetris.
1732000	1733000	Yeah?
1733000	1734000	Yes, I do.
1734000	1736000	So you own Forbidden Tetris?
1736000	1737000	Yes, I do.
1737000	1739000	I want Tangram Tetris.
1739000	1741000	That would be fascinating.
1741000	1744000	Whatever happened to the really shitty Tetris knockoffs we got?
1744000	1748000	Like, remember when Tetris got really popular like in the early 90s or so?
1748000	1752000	We got tons of just shitty, shitty ripoffs.
1752000	1755000	We had Word-Tris and Hat-Tris and what else?
1755000	1756000	Face-Tris.
1756000	1757000	But Blastris was real.
1757000	1760000	Well-Tris.
1760000	1763000	Tetris 2 Bomb Bliss.
1763000	1767000	Blastris was fun because you could shoot things.
1767000	1769000	Shooting always makes things better, right?
1769000	1770000	It was a Super Scope game.
1770000	1771000	Alright.
1771000	1772000	That was what made it cool.
1772000	1774000	Alright, enough reminiscing, I'm sorry.
1774000	1779000	Well, something else that is cool, and this is particularly cool for me, because I love
1779000	1782000	Hudson, and they're bringing us a real Bomberman.
1782000	1790000	Well, okay, it's for WiiWare, and it actually is real Bomberman.
1790000	1796000	I mean, we're talking about up to eight players in one game, at least that's what Famitsu
1796000	1797000	says.
1797000	1804000	It's going to be out in Japan in June, so hopefully we'll get it not too long, I hope.
1804000	1806000	But it's Bomberman.
1806000	1807000	I love Bomberman.
1807000	1809000	I know, and Bomberman's cool and all that.
1809000	1810000	I don't know, maybe it's just me.
1810000	1812000	I'm a little burned out on Bomberman.
1812000	1817000	How can you be burned out on Bomberman when all we've had are like little minigame crap
1817000	1823000	and then that horrible, horrible, I'm going to be Bomberman, but I'm going to be hardcore.
1823000	1825000	Oh, Bomberman X-Zero?
1825000	1826000	As in, piece of shit Bomberman.
1826000	1827000	Yeah, yeah, I know.
1827000	1831000	There was, and maybe that kind of just ruined Bomberman for me, like it's like watching
1831000	1833000	your childhood get raped right in front of your eyes.
1833000	1841000	We still regularly break out the Super Nintendo and the MultiTap and play, you know, Bomberman
1841000	1842000	2, Super Bomberman 2.
1842000	1845000	I'm thinking more of the recent Xbox Live one.
1845000	1848000	Remember how they had a Bomberman come out on Xbox Live, and it was pretty faithful to
1848000	1849000	the original?
1849000	1854000	I just, my resounding reaction to the game was, meh.
1854000	1859000	But this is an actual new Bomberman, it's Hudson!
1859000	1867000	Listen, Hudson, we play Bomberman on every system that's ever been made, ever, and then
1867000	1871000	some, and then you release four versions of it.
1871000	1877000	Listen, I know that it might seem like a good idea to release a lot of these each year,
1877000	1879000	because, you know, you need money.
1879000	1880000	I understand that.
1880000	1885000	But, at the same time, I don't know, other companies need to do the same thing, because,
1885000	1889000	fucking, fucking aye dude, how many Harvest Moon games do they really need to fucking
1889000	1890000	make?
1890000	1892000	I mean, they're really getting bad at that shit.
1892000	1895000	There's like four games coming out each year now.
1895000	1896000	I'd say more than four games.
1896000	1897000	I mean, that's whoring.
1897000	1901000	Okay, I'm reading something else on here on the actual Famitsu article.
1901000	1902000	Sure.
1902000	1907000	And from what I can see, you can actually play as your me as a character in this game.
1907000	1911000	Oh, in that case, I gotta buy that.
1911000	1914000	I sense that comment has a hint of sarcasm.
1914000	1919000	Well, no, I'm picking, I'm just trying to pick out what I can actually read on this.
1919000	1921000	That is kind of cool, to be honest.
1921000	1923000	I think that is an interesting feature.
1923000	1924000	I don't know why.
1924000	1929000	Can I mail away for an actual bomb, like, piece of plastic that I can put on my Wii
1929000	1935000	remote so that, you know, I can pretend I'm the real Bomberman, and look at me, I have
1935000	1936000	a bomb controller.
1936000	1940000	It's also saying something in here about you're getting a whole bunch of extra bonus items
1940000	1941000	and bomb upgrades.
1941000	1946000	You know, the usual stuff, it looks like there's some new stuff in here, and there's also,
1946000	1951000	it looks like, more area effect bombs on here, too.
1951000	1954000	I was just reading this over.
1954000	1958000	DarkSakura, somebody is in your fan club in chat.
1958000	1960000	Somebody is on your side here.
1960000	1963000	Odd1 in chat says, Bomberman is like Metal Slug.
1963000	1965000	I only want more, damn it.
1965000	1966000	Yes, okay.
1966000	1973000	Okay, how, how, you, you know that if I really like a game, I tend to like the entire series
1973000	1978000	of it, no matter how much repetition it has, which makes me really pissed off that they
1978000	1981000	haven't done another bus to move and we just got dance on it.
1981000	1986000	It's people like you that will make SNK constantly release the same damn game over and over and
1986000	1987000	over again.
1987000	1989000	It's people like me that keep SNK in business.
1989000	1993000	Yeah, seriously, because if people smarten it up and say, hey, wait a second, didn't
1993000	1996000	I buy this like four times already, that, you know.
1996000	2001000	Well, maybe they'll actually bring out the sequels that I want, which I'll get into later
2001000	2002000	in the show.
2002000	2006000	Here's my suggestion, though, for how to make Bomberman a little more appealing to
2006000	2008000	people like me.
2008000	2010000	Forbidden Bomberman.
2010000	2012000	He's on to something.
2012000	2013000	In blood effects.
2013000	2014000	I'm telling you.
2014000	2015000	I want blood effects.
2015000	2016000	God damn, I'm working on the wrong side of gaming.
2016000	2018000	I shouldn't be bitching about games like I do on the show.
2018000	2019000	I should be making games.
2019000	2020000	Okay.
2020000	2021000	Show of hands in chat.
2021000	2026000	Forbidden Bomberman, Y or N. Listen, here's what you need to do, okay.
2026000	2030000	This is a small bit of innovation, and it's ripping a little bit off of Taito, but who
2030000	2031000	cares.
2031000	2033000	Bomberman, mixed with Rampage.
2033000	2036000	You're blowing up cities, and you're fighting each other.
2036000	2038000	Who doesn't want that?
2038000	2041000	People like blowing things up, but they want a little bit more than just blowing up little
2041000	2042000	cartoon characters.
2042000	2043000	We need to take out, like, cities.
2043000	2044000	I like Rampage.
2044000	2048000	We need to quit our damn jobs and start a gaming company.
2048000	2050000	You are on a goldmine here.
2050000	2051000	Bomberman mixed with Rampage.
2051000	2052000	Genius.
2052000	2053000	Forbidden Bomberman.
2053000	2055560	Who doesn't like to blow up cities full of innocent people?
2055560	2056560	In games.
2056560	2057780	Only in game form.
2057780	2059140	Not in real life.
2059140	2060140	Just in game form.
2060140	2062120	Just great stress reliever.
2062120	2064120	Bomberman Rampage.
2064120	2065640	Alright.
2065640	2066880	Anyhow.
2066880	2074400	If Bomberman's not your type of game, then maybe this brand new game called Oichi De
2074400	2079760	Puti Puti, which, I know that sounds retarded, and it is kind of retarded.
2079760	2084800	It's actually a game based off of this toy that you can get, it's a keychain toy called
2084800	2091400	Puti Puti, and what it does is it makes bubble wrap popping noises, and this whole game is
2091400	2093000	popping bubble wrap.
2093000	2099360	Yes, they really want you to pay eight dollars, or eight hundred Wii points, to buy a game
2099360	2101840	that you pop bubble wrap.
2101840	2103600	I want it.
2103600	2104600	It's pretty.
2104600	2105600	Pretty dumb!
2105600	2109260	No, I was looking at the backgrounds and stuff, that's actually kind of pretty.
2109260	2110260	Game bubble wrap.
2110260	2111260	Awesome.
2111260	2112260	You know.
2112260	2113260	I have bubble wrap at my house.
2113260	2114260	How about the real thing?
2114260	2115260	Like, I like popping real b-
2115260	2118900	This is, honestly, this reminds me of when I went to Barnes and Noble like ten years
2118900	2122960	ago and found a big thick book full of fat bubble wrap.
2122960	2127660	I'm not joking, and it was called Stress Relief Book.
2127660	2130280	I am not kidding.
2130280	2134680	Are we sure there's not more to this, like maybe it just looks like it's a bubble wrap
2134680	2137600	popping game, but maybe there's more to it that we just don't know about yet?
2137600	2138600	I don't think so.
2138600	2140560	Is that a bad translation thing gone wrong?
2140560	2141560	I don't think so.
2141560	2143640	It's put out by Namco Bandai, so.
2143640	2144640	I mean, like-
2144640	2145740	So Pac-Man's gonna come out and eat it.
2145740	2150020	For less than that, though, I could go to See's Candies, because we all know the best
2150020	2153040	part of See's Candy is that you get the little bubble wrap with everything you buy.
2153040	2154280	I think that's California only.
2154280	2155280	Is that only in California?
2155280	2156280	I think so.
2156280	2157280	Well then, you know what-
2157280	2158280	I had never heard of See's until I moved out here.
2158280	2161280	Okay, the national and international people can just deal for a minute here.
2161280	2163120	California only for a minute here.
2163120	2164400	It's like getting something in the mail.
2164400	2167720	The best part of See's Candy is that you get a little piece of bubble wrap in the pack
2167720	2168720	with the candy.
2168720	2169720	I mean, think about it.
2169720	2174200	For $10, I get a little box of candy, and not only do I have real bubble wrap to pop,
2174200	2177160	but I also have- wait for it- candy!
2177160	2178160	Hello!
2178160	2180200	Here's the best part, though.
2180200	2187280	There's 40 levels that you'll be able to play, and of course it features vibration feedback.
2187280	2188280	Ooh.
2188280	2196240	Yeah, and in fact, they have a little link here on asovision.com slash pooty pooty.
2196240	2206000	You can watch a little movie of this stupid little bubble wrap thing, which- oh my god.
2206000	2207920	You like- that's crazy looking.
2207920	2212320	It looks like bubble wrap, but it's little buttons, and you pop them.
2212320	2213320	It's for stress relief.
2213320	2215400	It's bubble wrap that never wears out!
2215400	2218560	I mean, that right there is genius.
2218560	2224800	Amanda in chat is correcting me and says, the best part is that you get free samples.
2224800	2227480	I forgot, every time you go into C's, they actually give you a free sample.
2227480	2228480	Free is the best part.
2228480	2229480	Let's see.
2229480	2232920	Quelltippo, who has a name I'm probably still mispronouncing in chat, says, will it be like
2232920	2236600	gals panic and after you pop the bubble wrap, you see a naked girl?
2236600	2244720	No, this has a picture of T. Oh, hooray, a picture of T. Oh my god, this is great.
2244720	2245720	I want one.
2245720	2246720	Oh my god.
2246720	2249240	And it looks like this website sells them in five different colors.
2249240	2252040	White, blue, pink, orange, and black.
2252040	2253720	Hell, we can sell orange ones.
2253720	2256600	I want one to annoy people at work with.
2256600	2258000	I'm totally going to get one.
2258000	2261720	Well, let's talk about more incredibly awesome games that you can be spending your money
2261720	2264520	on in the near future.
2264520	2272160	There is a new game that is coming out on the DS, and it's called Babysitting Mania.
2272160	2276760	It's actually a game that you can play on the PC right now.
2276760	2283880	It's available at fenomengames.com, that's F-E-N-O-M-E-N dash G-A-M-E-S dot com.
2283880	2289200	You can actually play a game called Babysitting Mania, and here's how they advertise it on
2289200	2290200	the site.
2290200	2296720	From the makers of Nanny Mania comes the all new hit, Babysitting Mania.
2296720	2298460	Find out if you're the ultimate babysitter.
2298460	2303180	What if you didn't expect was 20 of the craziest houses you've ever imagined being...
2303180	2308600	And if the babies don't behave, then they get beat mania.
2308600	2310260	Now now.
2310260	2311760	That's not cool.
2311760	2316920	Alright, uh, yeah, but apparently they're porting that to the DS.
2316920	2317920	Why?
2317920	2320400	Because there's money in them DS's.
2320400	2321400	Apparently.
2321400	2322400	Apparently.
2322400	2326520	I think if one person buys it, they'll make back their budget.
2326520	2328520	I guess.
2328520	2334640	Well, anyway, how about something a little bit better, or maybe worse, depending on your
2334640	2340440	opinion of certain characters in the Sonic franchise.
2340440	2346560	Sonic RPG, of course, it's actually Sonic Chronicles, is coming out on the DS, and it
2346560	2352720	has been confirmed that we are getting some of Sonic's buddies, especially Bill, I'm not
2352720	2355880	saying Bill the Cat, Big the Cat.
2355880	2360000	It's the same Bill the Cat, because, you know, we're coming up on election season.
2360000	2361880	And I used to vote for Bill the Cat.
2361880	2364640	And plus, Bill the Cat in the game would actually be kind of cooler, I'm sorry.
2364640	2369400	He'd just walk around spitting on things, and hacking up hairballs, and then getting
2369400	2372320	drunk with, I guess, hot naked chicks or something.
2372320	2380920	But no, Big the Cat is definitely going to be in it, and it's of course being put out
2380920	2390200	by Bioware, and people, basically the co-founder who they were interviewing, Ray, is it pronounced
2390200	2397480	Musica, I guess, anyway, they actually asked him, you know, well, a lot of people don't
2397480	2401760	like these characters, he's like, well, the whole point is to make you attach an emotion
2401760	2405440	to the character, and dislike is an emotion.
2405440	2408000	It's like, okay.
2408000	2413320	Anyway, he says that all the characters are going to be really pivotal to the game, and
2413320	2418880	it's not like a whole bunch of little mini-games, but something that's fully interactive, so.
2418880	2422600	I guess, I don't know how I feel about that.
2422600	2427440	I actually thought that Big's part of the game was the most annoying part of Sonic Avenger.
2427440	2430840	Here, Froggy.
2430840	2433480	It should stop making retarded Sonic characters.
2433480	2437640	Like, Amy was cool, because she watched her own smack and stuff with a hammer.
2437640	2438640	That was cool.
2438640	2440200	Knuckles, cool.
2440200	2443440	Mecha Sonic, really cool.
2443440	2446480	But, no.
2446480	2449760	Can I take the show on a completely random, unrelated tangent for just a minute?
2449760	2450760	Oh, I know.
2450760	2451760	I know what you're reading.
2451760	2452760	That's the best thing.
2452760	2456720	Here's the thing, when you were talking about build the cat, I started thinking about all
2456720	2458000	these comic book cats, right?
2458000	2461420	I'm like, oh, then there's like Felix the cat, and there's, oh, oh, you know, all these
2461420	2462420	other cats, right?
2462420	2463720	Felix the cat is great though.
2463720	2468760	But then I thought about Garfield, and that made me think about Garfield minus Garfield.
2468760	2469760	Have you seen this cartoon?
2469760	2471400	Yes, I have.
2471400	2472800	It's the best thing ever.
2472800	2473800	They're more funny.
2473800	2474800	Yeah, exactly.
2474800	2476800	Because, like, Garfield's not funny.
2476800	2479140	But if you take out Garfield, it's actually really funny.
2479140	2480140	And there's this blog.
2480140	2482000	All the ones with normal.
2482000	2483800	There's this blog all about it.
2483800	2488160	It's garfield minus garfield dot t-u-m-b-l-r dot com.
2488160	2490920	Whatever happened to our website of the week segment?
2490920	2492940	It became the classic video game of the week segment.
2492940	2493940	You know what?
2493940	2498840	We need to just, just for a minute here.
2498840	2502600	I'm hijacking the website of the week segment.
2502600	2507520	My website of the week is garfield minus garfield dot t-u-m-b-l-r dot com.
2507520	2508520	Check it out.
2508520	2509520	It's hilarity.
2509520	2512120	Maybe you'll link it in the chat room for people.
2512120	2514840	Oh, sure, I'll do that for you guys right now.
2514840	2515840	Sorry live listeners.
2515840	2516840	There you go.
2516840	2522840	Anyway, sorry, there's your completely random off the subject tangent for tonight.
2522840	2526640	There you go.
2526640	2528160	Sorry.
2528160	2531680	No, it's okay.
2531680	2537320	Network problems, random tangents, sickness, this show has it all tonight.
2537320	2542000	Before you broke off on that whole Garfield thing, I was starting to say that Sonic and
2542000	2547720	his friends are kind of reminding me of Godzilla and the other monsters.
2547720	2551360	They had the staple monsters that they made and then they just started getting ridiculous
2551360	2554880	with the monsters, just not even trying.
2554880	2559840	I'm sure that someday they'd have a giant guy in underwear with broccoli on his head
2559840	2563080	or something like that and call it some fucking monster or whatever.
2563080	2564560	That's how ridiculous it is to get him.
2564560	2567200	Stop making Sonic characters and make some better Sonic games.
2567200	2569640	Hopefully this one is a little bit better.
2569640	2570640	I don't know.
2570640	2574160	Broccoli Man sounds kind of funny.
2574160	2576560	I mean, that's where the Mega Man series was going.
2576560	2579720	Perfect example, perfect example.
2579720	2580720	Broccoli Man.
2580720	2581720	Right.
2581720	2593680	Well, if you're on a weight loss kick like most of the people it seems like nowadays,
2593680	2595760	then you'll be interested in this title.
2595760	2602160	It's a game or I guess a piece of software for the DS called Might Weight Loss Coach
2602160	2607800	and it features a pedometer that will actually plug into your Game Boy Advance slot.
2607800	2613760	So basically you wear this pedometer around and it will actually track how much you're
2613760	2618800	exercising throughout the day or how much you're jiggling I guess and then track your
2618800	2622520	progress throughout the DS title.
2622520	2629880	And I'm not sure if they also have some exercises or something that talks you through, but I
2629880	2633220	guess that's kind of neat.
2633220	2634220	Kind of.
2634220	2635220	A little bit.
2635220	2636220	I guess.
2636220	2639200	It just shows the DS can do even more.
2639200	2645440	Now it's a meter that you can measure how far you've walked in a day.
2645440	2646440	Hooray.
2646440	2649640	Well, the PSP users get this game called WTF.
2649640	2651360	Have you ever played WTF?
2651360	2652360	Uh-huh.
2652360	2653360	It's kind of fun.
2653360	2654360	I love WTF.
2654360	2658880	Well, you get WTF on the PSP and now on the DS you're going to get LOL.
2658880	2659880	That's right.
2659880	2660880	Actually these two games are completely unrelated.
2660880	2662800	They just both have funny titles.
2662800	2668400	The DS is getting a game called LOL and it's being made by a company called H-Tech.
2668400	2671580	They are bringing LOL to the Nintendo DS.
2671580	2676960	Basically what happens, somebody in the room will write a challenge on their DS like for
2676960	2682040	instance the screenshot I'm looking at says draw panda bear and then within a time limit
2682040	2687640	everybody else in the room has to draw, it sounds like Pictionary to me, and then everybody
2687640	2690040	votes on the winner and then you go to the next challenge.
2690040	2691040	Okay.
2691040	2696680	So at first this sounded cool because it reminded me a lot of apples to apples where you would
2696680	2698880	do something like that.
2698880	2703560	But then I just started looking at this and thinking about it, can't you do this already
2703560	2704560	in PictoChat?
2704560	2710520	I mean, couldn't you, I don't know, do the exact same thing just with a little egg timer?
2710520	2712720	Or better yet, here's the thing.
2712720	2715960	Here's how you can play LOL without even a Nintendo DS.
2715960	2718880	It's called pen and paper.
2718880	2722280	Whoa, so what do I need to do this?
2722280	2725240	You would actually need to get some pens and some paper.
2725240	2728480	Now can I use any type of pens or certain pens will work for this?
2728480	2731880	Probably like a pen that would show up, like you wouldn't want to use a pink pen because
2731880	2735080	that's kind of hard to see unless you want to go for LOL value.
2735080	2739800	But make sure you have pen, and the paper, it could be lined paper or grid paper or blank
2739800	2740800	paper.
2740800	2746320	If people do insist on having it in a virtual environment, open Canvas.
2746320	2751640	Hi, you can network on open Canvas and everyone can draw on the same picture.
2751640	2753640	Now what do we need to do to get the word out about this pen and paper?
2753640	2754640	That Yahoo!
2754640	2756640	Chat thingy with the draw board is hilarious.
2756640	2759600	Or freakin' Oikaki, do that.
2759600	2762040	I really think you're onto something with this pen and paper.
2762040	2763040	I'm not sure, though.
2763040	2764040	I know, I'm telling you.
2764040	2768280	Look, think of what OLR Productions has come up with in the scope of just a few weeks.
2768280	2772960	We have Forbidden Bomberman, we have the pen and paper version of LOL, which we can totally
2772960	2778120	undercut these guys putting it out on DS, and remember, we're the ones that thought
2778120	2779840	of Laser Cats the game.
2779840	2780840	True.
2780840	2784300	I'm telling you, EA's going to buy us tomorrow.
2784300	2786400	It's just a matter of time.
2786400	2788400	Just a matter of time.
2788400	2792240	And oh, how we'll sell.
2792240	2797360	Let's have tea and chat says, pen and paper is the wave of the future.
2797360	2799480	Yeah.
2799480	2809480	So how about the wave of the future that is actually not necessarily in ours anytime soon?
2809480	2814280	Guess who else is getting Wii Fit before us?
2814280	2815280	Let's see.
2815280	2818680	How about, I don't know, what's a country we don't hear about very often in the news?
2818680	2819680	How about...
2819680	2820680	Slovakia.
2820680	2821680	Sure.
2821680	2823940	How about the country of Chad in Africa?
2823940	2825720	Is Chad getting the game before we are?
2825720	2827560	No, but they're getting it in Australia.
2827560	2829320	Chad ruined our elections.
2829320	2830320	Same thing.
2830320	2831320	Right?
2831320	2832320	Chad, Australia.
2832320	2833320	What's the difference?
2833320	2834320	Australia is cool.
2834320	2835320	I'm just kidding.
2835320	2836320	I love Australia.
2836320	2837320	Of course I do.
2837320	2839160	And we did get Priscilla, Queen of the Desert from them.
2839160	2840160	That's true.
2840160	2841800	One of my favorite movies ever is Muriel's Wedding.
2841800	2844320	I have to say.
2844320	2845320	And Olivia Newton-John.
2845320	2846320	Anyway.
2846320	2851880	Although, I bet most people who live in Australia would tell us there's plenty more to appreciate
2851880	2853840	about Australia than just those things.
2853840	2854840	And they gave us Kylie.
2854840	2855840	I don't know.
2855840	2856840	The opera house.
2856840	2857840	They did give us Kylie.
2857840	2858840	They gave us Kylie.
2858840	2863680	We had to test it on kangaroos before it's safe for Americans to use because we're very
2863680	2864680	kangaroo-like.
2864680	2868480	So, what's coming out in...
2868480	2870800	And act deaf, hit the nail on the head.
2870800	2875680	Without Australia, you would never have the dingo ate my baby.
2875680	2876760	You would never have that.
2876760	2879760	Or the didgeridoo techno.
2879760	2881760	Exactly.
2881760	2886720	Let's take a moment to salute our Australian fans and their history.
2886720	2887720	Their great history.
2887720	2889080	Thank you, Australia.
2889080	2890080	For Moeller.
2890080	2891080	Opera house.
2891080	2895320	So, see, Australia, because of their greatness and contributions to culture, they get the
2895320	2896320	game a little early.
2896320	2898480	I thought that was very nice of Nintendo to do.
2898480	2899480	Right.
2899480	2901600	Well, anyway, they're getting it on May 8th.
2901600	2903720	We're getting ours on May 19th.
2903720	2909420	And it should be coming out for $150 Australian, which is...
2909420	2914560	The equivalent is 140 here, or 91 euro.
2914560	2916200	It's already sold over a million units.
2916200	2920000	Our dollar went to shit, didn't it?
2920000	2923560	Our dollar really, really went to shit sometime in the past couple years, didn't it?
2923560	2926200	You know, if it gets any worse, we're going to have to start calling it pesos.
2926200	2927200	Oh my God.
2927200	2928200	Sorry.
2928200	2932360	So, you know, I could go to Europe and I could work.
2932360	2938720	I could go to Europe like people from Mexico come here to earn money and come back rich.
2938720	2941200	That'd be great.
2941200	2945880	Anyway, like I was saying, it's already sold over a million units in Japan.
2945880	2953320	It's coming out on April 25th in Europe for 69.99 pounds in the UK and 89.99 euro everywhere
2953320	2955400	else in Europe.
2955400	2959280	And we're getting it on the 19th of May.
2959280	2964160	So that gets the whatever award for me, but I don't know.
2964160	2966800	Congratulations, Australia.
2966800	2972040	You've beat out Europe and America.
2972040	2973080	Kudos to you.
2973080	2976120	We're just trying to make it fair, I guess.
2976120	2977120	I don't know.
2977120	2978120	Karpat can ask a question.
2978120	2980040	What is the capital of Australia?
2980040	2981040	Sydney?
2981040	2982040	Nope.
2982040	2984680	That's the most common mistake.
2984680	2985680	But like, see, I could...
2985680	2986680	I know it's not Sydney.
2986680	2987680	It's Canberra.
2987680	2990920	But here's the thing is that, but you could do the same thing is that like, quick Australian
2990920	2991920	listeners.
2991920	2994680	What's the capital of Florida?
2994680	2996960	How many of you said Miami?
2996960	2997960	It's not.
2997960	2998960	It's not.
2998960	2999960	It's Tallahassee.
2999960	3000960	Right.
3000960	3001960	Just saying.
3001960	3004800	Miami is the capital of where old folks go to die.
3004800	3006800	And Miami is also the capital of cocaine.
3006800	3008960	Come on.
3008960	3009960	I'm kidding.
3009960	3010960	Love Miami.
3010960	3011960	Love you guys.
3011960	3013560	When have you been to Miami?
3013560	3014560	Wow, tonight.
3014560	3018440	Actually, I went to their airport once on my way to Jamaica.
3018440	3024000	I have been to Miami thousands of times thanks to the power of television.
3024000	3027280	I've actually been to Miami once and I was two years old.
3027280	3031160	Yeah, see, and SSG 100 Man has a perfect example.
3031160	3034840	You ask people what the capital of California is, hello, we live there, and most people
3034840	3035840	don't know.
3035840	3041320	If you say Los Angeles, then you need to get your head out of your ass, because Los Angeles...
3041320	3042320	Hey, wait a minute.
3042320	3043840	You said Sydney was the capital of Australia.
3043840	3045080	Get your head out of your ass.
3045080	3047120	But I don't live there, so I have an excuse.
3047120	3049200	Or get your ass out of your head, because it's Australia.
3049200	3050200	Get it upside down.
3050200	3051200	Get it.
3051200	3052200	And the toilet splashed backwards.
3052200	3053760	What the hell happened to tonight's show?
3053760	3056160	It's just, it's just, it's just not right.
3056160	3057680	I'm going to keep going then.
3057680	3058680	Please do.
3058680	3059680	Please.
3059680	3061480	It's coming out here in May pretty soon.
3061480	3062540	I'm pretty psyched about it.
3062540	3064080	It's called Blastworks.
3064080	3066280	Originally, it was Tamiki Fighters.
3066280	3071720	Of course, now it's been, it's very little like Tamiki Fighters now.
3071720	3073880	But still the same kind of concept.
3073880	3078680	What's kind of neat about it, though, is you'll actually, of course, the game has like about
3078680	3082200	20 different levels you can play and stuff, and plays a little bit like Katamari meets,
3082200	3085280	you know, a really intense shooter game.
3085280	3091800	But now you'll be able to design completely new ships, new levels, new enemies, new AI
3091800	3093800	patterns, and new bullet patterns.
3093800	3099560	So I mean, completely customizable, and you can share all this content over WeConnect24,
3099560	3100560	which is pretty cool.
3100560	3104960	So some of the levels, I guess, they were just showing off to like Joystick, for example.
3104960	3108620	One of them looked like the environment was made out of paper, and you're actually flying
3108620	3113500	a paper airplane and fighting other paper airplanes and origamies, enemies and stuff
3113500	3114500	like that.
3114500	3116200	So really cool stuff.
3116200	3122160	Plus the game itself also has unlockable versions of Tamiki Fighters and some of the other games
3122160	3124320	made by Kent Ducho.
3124320	3128680	And if you're interested in checking out Tamiki Fighters, it's actually available for free
3128680	3130440	on his website.
3130440	3134180	Just do a search for Tamiki Fighters and definitely check it out.
3134180	3142600	The game is slated to come out in the US in May, and I can't wait to check it out.
3142600	3144480	Well this actually sounds kind of cool.
3144480	3147400	It's kind of interesting that a game like this, it's kind of a, I wouldn't call this
3147400	3151200	like a AAA title by any means, I mean it's based off an indie game, but kind of has all
3151200	3155000	these features that we've been really waiting for on a lot of Wii games on it.
3155000	3159680	Yeah, it looks really cool, and actually the four games that you can unlock in it are Rootage,
3159680	3163640	Gunroar, Taurus Trooper, and of course the original Tamiki Fighters.
3163640	3167400	So that's pretty cool, and I think this is going to be one of those games that a lot
3167400	3170620	of people aren't going to know about, you know, it's one of those under-the-radar games.
3170620	3173960	Is it going to be one of those under-the-radar costs, where it's only $20, or do we know
3173960	3177020	a price point on this yet?
3177020	3180320	If I remember correctly, I think it was like $39.99.
3180320	3185040	So it's kind of your typical Wii, well, one step below your AAA Wii titles basically.
3185040	3188100	But I mean, I think the value's pretty good, I mean if it was just going to be a straight
3188100	3194000	port of Tamiki Fighters, it might be a little high, but with all the user-created stuff,
3194000	3198040	I mean you can get pretty crazy with this game, so it'll be fun.
3198040	3202160	Very good gaming story to bring us back from our capitals of the world discussion, I appreciate
3202160	3203160	that.
3203160	3205540	He's always working hard for O.L.R., isn't he?
3205540	3206540	Very good.
3206540	3207540	Yes.
3207540	3214440	But yeah, definitely there's some video footage that looks like it's on GameTrailers.com,
3214440	3218560	and they also have some links on Joystiq, you know, definitely check out the trailer
3218560	3219560	if you can.
3219560	3223800	If you've never played this game, do yourself a favor and play it, because it's really fun.
3223800	3226000	At least Tamiki Fighters is.
3226000	3227000	Alright.
3227000	3230940	Well, speaking of traveling the world and the capitals of the world, let's talk about
3230940	3235480	what's coming out in Tokyo soon, because that is the capital of Japan.
3235480	3239400	But actually, this will be the entirety of Japan, is getting these releases.
3239400	3246080	This week in gaming, on March 19th, they are getting on the Xbox 360 Armored Core for Answer,
3246080	3254240	Army of Two, Blazing Angels 2, Need for Speed Pro Street, Sengoku Mosu 2, and that's quite
3254240	3256360	a few Xbox 360 games for one week.
3256360	3258280	There you go.
3258280	3262400	OddOne in chat says this is a favorite part of the show, Rob butchering the Japanese releases.
3262400	3265040	That's why I read them, because I can't pronounce any of them.
3265040	3267960	PlayStation 3, I can pronounce Armored Core.
3267960	3268960	That's easy enough.
3268960	3273320	PlayStation 3 also gets Armored Core, also gets Army of Two, also gets Blazing Angels
3273320	3279360	2, but gets another game, Folk Soul, Unishanweta Densho.
3279360	3282880	You might just know that as Folklore, but that's actually getting a price reduction
3282880	3285500	that's already been out there, it's just a price reduction.
3285500	3291620	Also getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3, Resistance, Ridge Racer 7, which I can't
3291620	3295760	pronounce, and Mobile Suit Gundam, Target Insight, all getting price reductions this
3295760	3296920	week.
3296920	3299920	And cheaper games is never bad news.
3299920	3304840	On the Nintendo Wii, speaking of price reductions, Bomberland Wii is moving in to the best, but
3304840	3309400	some new games coming out, Spider-Man 3 just now coming out in Japan.
3309400	3312680	I would suggest you just pass on that, but maybe you want to pick up the House of the
3312680	3318040	Dead 2 and 3 with the Wii Zapper, also being sold independently there.
3318040	3321720	Dekka Sporta also coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan.
3321720	3328420	Moving on to the PlayStation 2, nothing really new coming out there, just some price reductions
3328420	3331300	on The Godfather and Kamiwaza.
3331300	3334280	Something to look forward to next week is the Metal Gear Solid collection, if you're
3334280	3335280	looking out for that.
3335280	3340000	Let's check out the handhelds, moving on to the Nintendo DS, Bangayo Spirits comes out
3340000	3341000	this week in Japan.
3341000	3342000	Yay!
3342000	3345880	And Chonaketsu Koku Kunio-kun Dodge Ball comes out.
3345880	3346880	Yay!
3346880	3349280	This is going to be a fun week for Japan.
3349280	3358040	Coming out from Konami, Kachushima Kosaku DS, Dikuru Otoko no Love and Success.
3358040	3365000	SimCity DS 2 also comes out from EA on the Nintendo DS, and quickly glancing at the PSP
3365000	3368820	to see if there's anything of note for you guys in Japan on there.
3368820	3373640	Biohazard Trilogy Box, but that's the movies, sorry, not the games.
3373640	3376740	But if you want that on your PSP, you can check that out.
3376740	3381240	Also a port of Need for Speed Pro Street, and since Skype was recently released in Japan,
3381240	3384880	I believe we covered that in last week's news, the PSP microphone is finally hitting the
3384880	3387000	shelves this week in Japan.
3387000	3388000	So check it out.
3388000	3389960	I want Kunio-kun Dodge Ball.
3389960	3393120	Well, you can import it from one of your favorite import retails.
3393120	3396520	Or if you wait a few months, it'll be coming out over here.
3396520	3401520	So I want my Kunio-kun Dodge Ball, which we would, of course, know over here as Super
3401520	3405080	Dodge Ball, because it was sweet.
3405080	3407240	Those Dodge Ball games are awesome.
3407240	3411280	I love all the Kunio games, they're so nice.
3411280	3420200	But anyway, for our friends overseas in the UK, I have some releases for you guys.
3420200	3427440	On the 20th, CSI Crime Scene Investigation Hard Evidence on Wii, Mystery Dungeon Sheeran
3427440	3433400	the Wanderer on DS, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, Sega Superstars Tennis on a bunch
3433400	3442080	of stuff, Spin Out, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Victorious
3442080	3446920	Boxers Challenge, and then we've got some games on the 21st.
3446920	3449360	That would be Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fate.
3449360	3458480	We have Off-Road for PS2, PC, and PSP, Samurai Warriors 2, Extreme Legends, and that's it.
3458480	3462280	Very surprised no one mentioned Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fate in their
3462280	3463280	gaming weeks.
3463280	3466720	Because I heard the game came out, some of my friends picked it up, and have been raving
3466720	3467720	about it.
3467720	3468720	I didn't like Crystal Chronicles.
3468720	3473880	I didn't either, but the DS version doesn't look quite like the GameCube one, so it might
3473880	3475760	be worth a look, I don't know.
3475760	3476760	I'm just curious.
3476760	3477760	How about Chatters?
3477760	3479440	Are Chatters picking it up?
3479440	3482880	Post your reviews real quickly, I'll read some of them in a minute.
3482880	3486720	In the US, we're getting a few things that are pretty interesting.
3486720	3493200	This week, of course, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,
3493200	3498160	Sega Superstars Tennis coming out on almost everything, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3,
3498160	3500720	Xbox 360, Wii, and the DS.
3500720	3505960	The Metal Gear Solid Essentials Collection is coming out on PlayStation 2, if you want
3505960	3511600	to relive some of those older Metal Gear games before number 4 comes out.
3511600	3517080	Condemned 2 Bloodshot on PlayStation 3, apparently a week late.
3517080	3520880	Hot Shots Golf Out of Bounds on PlayStation 3.
3520880	3524120	Lost in Blue 3 on the DS.
3524120	3527960	I'm still shocked that they actually got a third game in that series.
3527960	3533040	I wouldn't be surprised if we see a fourth one either, or horn that thing to death.
3533040	3537800	Kingstar 90's Edition is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.
3537800	3545580	Samurai Warriors 2 Extreme Legends on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 via download.
3545580	3554980	Some other fun stuff, Worms of Space Oddity on the Wii, Fantasy Aquarium on the DS, Go
3554980	3561440	Pets Vacation Island on the DS, which looks really weird and kind of stupid looking, Pro
3561440	3567080	Evolution Soccer 2008 on the Wii, that one also is a week late, George of the Jungle
3567080	3578480	on PlayStation 2, Wii, and the DS, and let's see here, the PlayStation 3 version of Karaoke
3578480	3580940	Revolution American Idol is finally coming out.
3580940	3592120	That totally delayed for about a month now, and let's see, I believe that's it.
3592120	3597480	Next week though, the week after next, I should say, and I can't wait for this, Crisis Core,
3597480	3602360	Final Fantasy VII for the PSP.
3602360	3609960	All right, well, moving on, talking about something recently hitting the US, DDR, you
3609960	3610960	remember DDR?
3610960	3622240	Our whole show used to be about DDR, and DDR is still going, obviously we get phone calls
3622240	3626000	from folks on Skype once in a while, why don't you love Bomani like you used to, then we
3626000	3631320	have to say, because it hasn't changed, well anyhow, actually, DDR is changing a little
3631320	3632320	bit.
3632320	3636000	E-Amusement, you've heard of this before, E-Amusement is a system they have in Japan
3636000	3639240	where you basically have these little cars, picture, y'all know, if you've been in the
3639240	3642320	arcade, y'all know Initial D, right, how you have the cards, picture something like
3642320	3646760	that but on a DDR machine, where you can kind of save your high scores, but it's also hooked
3646760	3650920	into the internet, and so you can have these global leaderboards and all this stuff.
3650920	3655240	Well, guess what, the E-Amusement system finally, after all these years, is hitting America.
3655240	3656240	That was damn time.
3656240	3661920	And this is coming from an official Konami website, DDROnlineCommunity.com is their website,
3661920	3667080	and it's got the Konami logos and all that fun stuff, is they are announcing that Naperville,
3667080	3671360	Illinois of all places, because when I think of arcade gaming, I think of Naperville, Illinois,
3671360	3675000	but this must be one hella good arcade, Brunswick Zone is the arcade, is going to be getting
3675000	3678120	the E-Amusement system, and come to think of it, this is an arcade that usually does
3678120	3682080	a lot of the beta tests for DDR, so I'm not surprised, it's just kind of funny that, you
3682080	3685440	know, ground zero for DDR evolution.
3685440	3688440	I'm not sure, because I don't know too much about Bedson, but maybe it's close to one
3688440	3692720	of Bedson's distribution centers, something like that, maybe, I don't know, I'm just guessing.
3692720	3696480	Brunswick makes me think of bowling.
3696480	3698520	I know, I think Brunswick did make bowling stuff.
3698520	3699520	They make bowling pins.
3699520	3702560	They might do entertainment stuff, you know, in other places.
3702560	3706560	But anyhow, and as Konami says on the site, it's the new online service which connects
3706560	3709360	arcade locations in North America via the internet.
3709360	3712440	Arcade players can compete with each other, review their ranking, tournament results,
3712440	3714120	save the play data, and more.
3714120	3719180	Konami will expand this new level service nationwide with Brunswick Bowling and Billiards.
3719180	3722760	So coming to a bowling alley near you, there you have it.
3722760	3728200	Now my question is, is this enough to make you interested in DDR again?
3728200	3729200	Maybe.
3729200	3730200	I say not really.
3730200	3734360	I kind of miss the old internet ranking that we had back in the day.
3734360	3735600	Oh yeah, that was old school.
3735600	3742040	But yeah, I mean, besides the fact that I do miss DDR a little bit for the nostalgia
3742040	3746040	value, here's the reason why I don't think this is exactly the kick in the butt in the
3746040	3750680	community that DDR's kind of needed for about, oh, four years now, is that the internet's
3750680	3755120	already been doing this long before Konami decided to officially endorse it.
3755120	3756120	Right?
3756120	3758200	This has been going on since, like, Fourth Mix.
3758200	3761200	That's, you know, those sites, like, what are those tracking sites for DDR?
3761200	3762760	I mean, they've come and gone.
3762760	3764040	That's how long those things have been around.
3764040	3767080	Well, it didn't a long time ago, and it was built in the Fourth Mix.
3767080	3771000	They had a code that you could write down that you could go onto the website and plug
3771000	3773560	it in, and there's your internet rankings.
3773560	3776880	And I understand this is a little more fluid than that system, but, you know, I'm just
3776880	3781360	thinking of those websites where, you know, you could type in your scores, like, they
3781360	3783000	have them for all types of music games.
3783000	3786880	You type in your scores, what letter grade you got on it, and, you know, you can get
3786880	3791020	a little signature banner, and it's basically like, you know, here's how big your E-penis
3791020	3794240	is because I passed all these DDR songs.
3794240	3797080	And then somebody could challenge you if they thought you were lying about your score, blah
3797080	3798080	blah blah blah blah.
3798080	3799080	I think it's cool.
3799080	3800080	Um, what's...
3800080	3801720	GS68 says VJ Army.
3801720	3803440	Yeah, like that, but DDR.
3803440	3805240	There was one for DDR they had.
3805240	3806240	Here's what they need to do.
3806240	3811400	And this would be pretty cool, uh, is, I don't know, you could have, like, certain, you know,
3811400	3815960	teams or whatever that you, I guess, associate yourself with.
3815960	3818520	I don't know how many, like, different colors or whatever.
3818520	3822480	And then you could say, like, you play different arcades around, you know, the country or the
3822480	3827400	world or whatever, and you kind of capture them, and they become, like, you know, blue
3827400	3829800	or whatever, or red or whatever your color is.
3829800	3832020	And then, kind of like, remember how they had with Soul Calibur?
3832020	3833020	I think it was Soul Calibur.
3833020	3834020	Yeah, yeah.
3834020	3835020	That was fun.
3835020	3836020	Yeah.
3836020	3837020	That's what I'm talking about.
3837020	3838020	Making DDR a more competitive game, right?
3838020	3839020	Yeah.
3839020	3844040	That's what I've been saying for five years on this program that DDRs needed to do.
3844040	3846280	There is innovation sitting in there in the game.
3846280	3848960	Just make DDR more competitive as opposed to cooperative game.
3848960	3853720	You could make a whole new game out of it and really kick some butt in the franchise,
3853720	3854720	but nobody's listening.
3854720	3859400	What they need to do, and I'm not sure who's in charge of the DDR games, is they need to
3859400	3862600	get someone new in charge of the DDR games.
3862600	3868840	DDR Recall, says Akdeft, was the name of what I was trying to think of earlier, thank you.
3868840	3870840	There it is.
3870840	3875320	Anyhow, so those of you that are still playing DDR, and I know we have a lot of DDR fans
3875320	3878600	at least, I'm not trying to knock DDR, I mean, obviously, it's still a great game because
3878600	3879600	it keeps you physical and everything.
3879600	3884240	Hey, if I had the money and the room, I'd be buying a machine for my house, okay, so
3884240	3885240	whatever.
3885240	3887240	I'd still be playing that.
3887240	3890700	It just frustrates me that they won't innovate the damn game.
3890700	3893320	I just don't have time to make it down to arcades anymore, so.
3893320	3897520	I'll say it one more time, if anybody happens to be listening, and I know we have folks
3897520	3903000	on the inside that listen to this show once in a great while, nuke your code, build something
3903000	3907720	from the ground up, innovate in the process, watch money flow in.
3907720	3912080	And stop, for the love of God, I know that you like doing these other modes like the
3912080	3917660	fitness mode and that kind of shit, you don't need to go that crazy with this stuff, I mean,
3917660	3922080	I think they've made it too user friendly, too simple, you know what I mean?
3922080	3926520	I don't think you need a training mode in every single DDR game, because I know I didn't
3926520	3932800	need a training mode to play the damn game, I learned just fine by playing the damn game.
3932800	3935160	Let's move on.
3935160	3936160	Can we?
3936160	3937160	Yes.
3937160	3944760	Well, there is more news out there that will make iPhone owners happy, including myself.
3944760	3951520	There are going to be some game releases, including Pac-Man and Galaga, and that makes
3951520	3952720	me very happy.
3952720	3953720	Also...
3953720	3955920	Sorry, go ahead.
3955920	3962160	Also bejeweled, so I guess it's, I mean, Zuma and Pagle, which I don't really give a crap
3962160	3964240	about, I just care about Pac-Man and Galaga.
3964240	3966960	Pagle is really awesome, actually.
3966960	3967960	Is it?
3967960	3968960	Yes.
3968960	3970960	Oh thank God, I can play Pac-Man!
3970960	3975200	I wonder if you play with your finger.
3975200	3978640	Can't you play pretty much all these games on the iPod anyway?
3978640	3980200	Including Pagle?
3980200	3983840	Which is actually one of the better, I think the iPod was made for Pagle, it's awesome.
3983840	3988240	From what I hear it sucks, like Bejeweled you have to cycle through all the gems and
3988240	3993560	stuff using the little, whatever the fuck they call that thing, scroll wheel, touch
3993560	3996200	wheel, gay wheel, whatever.
3996200	3998520	The whole screen is touch screen.
3998520	4000120	It's just, I don't know.
4000120	4004040	I think you should just be able to poke whichever one and then poke the one next to it.
4004040	4005320	I think Bejeweled would be good on it.
4005320	4007120	I think that would work pretty well.
4007120	4009400	I'm surprised they haven't put Bejeweled on the DS yet.
4009400	4014440	I mean, they really, fuck, put a PopCap collection on the DS.
4014440	4015680	Watch how much that sells.
4015680	4017800	You know what else would work out?
4017800	4021440	You know what other games would work really well on the iPhone?
4021440	4023040	New things.
4023040	4025440	New games.
4025440	4027840	Things that haven't been thought of yet.
4027840	4029560	New stuff.
4029560	4031320	We have this game that we would like to pitch.
4031320	4032920	It's called Pen and Paper.
4032920	4038240	You can use the iPhone as paper and you can write stuff with your stylus, which is the
4038240	4039240	pen.
4039240	4040960	Yes, and here's one.
4040960	4044880	It's based off a popular Saturday Night Live sketch and you have cats and they have lasers
4044880	4049320	attached to their heads and where you touch on the screen you shoot lasers at dogs and
4049320	4054120	people and sometimes other laser cats in multiplayer mode.
4054120	4056320	I just had a random thought pop into my head.
4056320	4057320	What's that?
4057320	4059880	I had a different video game experience this week but that was watching the Family Guy
4059880	4063280	Star Wars special.
4063280	4064840	Did it feel like a game or something?
4064840	4070080	No, they were going into an asteroid field and it was asteroids.
4070080	4071680	Nice.
4071680	4073200	Anyway.
4073200	4082400	So, apparently the Chinese Olympics website has been accused of game piracy.
4082400	4086920	Apparently they have been stealing some Flash games that they feature on the website and
4086920	4093040	kind of changing them just a little bit but they're still blatantly stealing them.
4093040	4100120	According to the creator of these Flash games, Caden Batrick, who noticed some very similar
4100120	4106440	similarities with different games like Fua Fights, The Olympic Clouds, which is very
4106440	4109680	similar to his Snow Day game that he has.
4109680	4113160	Also there are some other ones that were also very similar.
4113160	4121760	Of course, these have been removed from the Olympic sites as of last Monday but there
4121760	4127960	are still a couple of games that are on there that may be stolen from some other websites
4127960	4131120	as well.
4131120	4136960	As if we didn't need more reasons to say the Olympics suck.
4136960	4140720	Odd One has an interesting comment in chat that says, wait, aren't most Flash games rip
4140720	4145400	offs of each other or classic games, seriously, the Flash arena is rife with IP theft and
4145400	4146400	copying.
4146400	4149400	True, they are, but this I think was like blatant.
4149400	4155400	I mean, just like, if you made like a Super Mario Brothers game but instead you changed
4155400	4160420	it to, I don't know, a female chicken or something like that, that would be a blatant ripoff
4160420	4163680	of Mario Brothers.
4163680	4167160	And I don't know, you called it like Chick Sisters or something like that.
4167160	4168280	Wasn't that the PETA game?
4168280	4169600	Oh yes, that was!
4169600	4171400	That's right, yeah, blatant ripoff.
4171400	4175200	Not really, though, because the level design was totally different, but yeah, I get what
4175200	4176200	you're saying.
4176200	4177200	Yeah, it was crap.
4177200	4180200	Made me hungry for chicken, though.
4180200	4181200	Alright.
4181200	4185840	And really, who goes to the Chinese Olympics website to play Flash games?
4185840	4188320	I mean, are people that bored?
4188320	4189920	I don't think so.
4189920	4192200	Good question.
4192200	4198960	Well, we're just about done with part A tonight, but first off we have to read about our stupid
4198960	4200240	person of the week.
4200240	4203720	And actually, I don't know, this isn't so much stupid, it's just kind of sad.
4203720	4207360	I don't really know how else to say it, so let's cue some music to read this very sad
4207360	4213440	story.
4213440	4223600	A 15-year-old boy in the Austin area of Austin, Texas, got killed, gunshot wound to the head.
4223600	4228720	The boy was playing a video game and his friend just shot him in the head, 13-year-old shooter
4228720	4235360	shoots his 15-year-old friend in the head over a video game, I suppose is what the story
4235360	4239600	is trying to say, because they do make a mention at the very end of this story.
4239600	4243240	The boys were playing a video game, the game was called God of War.
4243240	4250760	Oh yes, because there's tons of gun violence in God of War.
4250760	4256920	Thank you so much to these kids for giving Gamers Everywhere a wonderful name.
4256920	4258920	How are the parents?
4258920	4259920	Where?
4259920	4263640	Out buying more ammo, of course.
4263640	4267480	Okay, I don't see how, there's no way they're going to be able to tie that to the game,
4267480	4270480	because there's no fucking guns in God of War.
4270480	4271480	At all.
4271480	4272480	Zero.
4272480	4277000	It just sucks.
4277000	4282800	I mean, it's not funny, it's sad, it's just kids shooting each other, but you've got to
4282800	4286640	wonder, where did the kid learn to shoot someone else, where did the kid learn to load a gun?
4286640	4287640	Maybe it was already loaded.
4287640	4289640	It's not that hard to load a gun.
4289640	4290640	Well, it's just sad.
4290640	4292640	It's not that hard to pull a trigger, either.
4292640	4298320	All right, well let's try to make the show a little better, and for that we're going
4298320	4300960	to turn to Dark Sakura to help us out a little bit.
4300960	4305000	Dark Sakura, do you think you can help make our show a little better tonight?
4305000	4306000	I could.
4306000	4311300	All right, well she's going to do that by sharing with us her pick for a classic video
4311300	4313320	game to pay some respect to.
4313320	4318120	It's called Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.
4318120	4320600	And what game did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?
4320600	4328440	The game I picked was actually a series of games called The Last Blade, which was a Neo
4328440	4331400	Geo game put out by SNK.
4331400	4339760	I actually have the Dreamcast Last Blade 2 myself, and it's such a really, really good
4339760	4344800	2D fighter, I mean really, really good.
4344800	4351240	It's set around in...
4351240	4352240	I would have to...
4352240	4359320	I'm not really exactly when the exact time frame is in Japan, because there's references
4359320	4366620	to the Shinsengumi, to fighting for the Shogun, so I would assume it's right.
4366620	4369800	And from what I can tell from the characters in the game, it's sort of right around that
4369800	4370800	transitional period.
4370800	4376500	But it's really just, you've got people who use different weapons.
4376500	4384800	One of the guys who worked on Guilty Gear actually helped develop this game, too.
4384800	4387440	And it's really, really good.
4387440	4394000	You've also got your choice of using power or speed, so you can have a stronger, slower
4394000	4397360	character, you can have someone who's weaker, but faster.
4397360	4402200	And of course, you've got your attacks and combos that incorporate all of that.
4402200	4408400	I just really think that it's a very nice game, and one of the other things that it
4408400	4417520	brought into it was a deflect, where you could block a move, and then you would be able to
4417520	4419800	instantly attack.
4419800	4424560	So I thought that was a pretty neat function, as well.
4424560	4431520	Also, Last Blade was the first SNK game to bring in Super Campus into its gameplay.
4431520	4437840	And you've got desperation moves, super moves, all kinds of stuff, it's just really, really
4437840	4438840	a fun game.
4438840	4441080	The series is fun.
4441080	4446440	And the thing I like about it, too, is that the music is pretty, I guess, almost on the
4446440	4450400	classical end, and one of the things that I really liked about it, and this is going
4450400	4455800	to sound kind of cheeseball, is that when you go into each stage, you sort of have a
4455800	4461600	little cutscene in the top corner that sets up the area you're playing in.
4461600	4466440	And I think it's really cool, not just for the story, the characters themselves, but
4466440	4469520	the environments in the game.
4469520	4470640	And the explosive blood!
4470640	4474680	I love the little fatality-type things they do there, I just saw one in the little, like...
4474680	4478640	Look, this is the perfect successor to the Samurai Shodown series.
4478640	4479640	Very nice.
4479640	4483080	It's just a lot of fun.
4483080	4486680	Lots of approval from the chat room on your pick tonight, DarkSakura.
4486680	4491160	I believe Footy in chat said it was his favorite 2D fighter ever.
4491160	4492160	Yeah.
4492160	4493160	Ever.
4493160	4494160	Oh, sorry.
4494160	4499640	I was going to say, there was, I'm trying to remember the character that I played the
4499640	4504840	most, because I played the one who dressed up as her brother.
4504840	4506600	And I don't remember the character.
4506600	4507600	You played a cross-dresser?
4507600	4509040	Yes, I did.
4509040	4516160	I was going to say, there was another game that's out there, that sold 1 point, or, uh...
4516160	4518560	It was Kojiro, sorry.
4518560	4524240	Point one eight million now for, uh, Eye of Judgment.
4524240	4525740	Never gonna happen.
4525740	4527240	Never gonna happen.
4527240	4534240	All right, well, there you have it, tonight's classic game of the week, The Last Blade.
4534240	4535920	Just the whole damn series.
4535920	4536920	On every platform.
4536920	4537920	Neo Geo, Dreamcast.
4537920	4538920	There's one on Dreamcast, right?
4538920	4539920	There's Dreamcast.
4539920	4542560	I believe that there were PS2 versions.
4542560	4546800	I do want to say that there were, but of course, the Dreamcast one was, like, beautiful.
4546800	4551760	All right, so we'll say the Dreamcast version, then, because you're such a Dreamcast fan.
4551760	4554040	I love Dreamcast.
4554040	4555040	Really everything.
4555040	4556800	All right, so check that out, The Last Blade.
4556800	4561320	Uh, that's going to bring our part A to a close tonight, so we're going to take a break,
4561320	4566480	and we'll be back, though, never fear, with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
4566480	4570880	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice
4570880	4571880	a week.
4571880	4584840	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
