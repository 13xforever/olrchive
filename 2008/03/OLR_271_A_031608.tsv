13820	24637	Tonight, March 16th, 2008, Tetris and Bomberman are WiiWare bound, E-Amuse hits the DDR scene in North America, and are the rumors about a Blu-ray drive on the 360 true?
31977	33478	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
33518	35740	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35760	41984	We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42024	44186	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week.
44286	47688	Also here with you every week, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48469	48769	Hi.
49189	49730	How are you, Ms.
49770	50030	Summers?
50991	53732	I'm completely enamored with what I'm looking at.
53972	55333	What are you looking at, pray tell?
55553	56213	A melodica.
56553	57153	A melodica.
57194	59134	Are you shopping for musical instruments online tonight?
59294	59815	Yes, I am.
60115	66737	Did last week's techno didgeridoo inspire you to come up with an underappreciated instrument of your own?
67157	71219	Well, I actually have, there's a few instruments that I personally want to own myself.
71239	77742	And one of them is a melodica, which is like a keyboard, but you play it like with the mouthpiece.
78522	78742	Nice.
79466	81426	And so it sounds sort of like a harmonica, but not quite.
83787	86827	I also want an auto-harp.
88388	88628	Fun.
88688	90228	Because I used to play auto-harp when I was little.
91508	92268	What about kazoo?
92688	95189	Is kazoo not satisfying to anyone anymore?
95449	96129	Is that the problem?
96589	96969	Not really.
97489	98689	My wife auto-harps.
100250	103070	Say hello to the smartass over there, Techmaster Loki.
104110	104450	Hi.
105110	106331	So your wife auto-harps, huh?
106511	106751	Yes.
106771	107511	That's nice to know.
108391	108731	All right.
109193	111196	I don't have to tell her to complain at all.
111296	112417	She just does it on her own.
113879	114219	How are you?
114760	115341	Oh, I get it.
115661	116482	There's a joke in there.
117443	120727	And how are you otherwise this week, Techmaster Loki?
120847	121388	I'm okay.
121949	122289	Excellent.
122489	124272	Are you shopping for any musical instruments of your own?
124732	124852	No.
125173	125393	Okay.
125733	126194	Just checking.
127411	130332	Okay, well, let's get into how we always start off the show.
130732	134194	First, let me introduce the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
135054	136715	There's several people in chat tonight.
137055	140376	Kind of a smaller turnout, though, on the live stream than I've seen in recent weeks.
140416	140876	So I'm not sure.
140916	142617	Is there something else going on tonight I'm not aware of?
143697	146558	No more Grammy Awards, no Oscars, no Super Bowl.
146718	146978	What else?
147159	147499	I guess.
148279	149179	Go outside night?
150100	151260	See Patty's Eve?
151320	151720	I don't know.
151740	154441	Oh, maybe people are camping out outside the bars waiting for 6 a.m.
154501	154861	I don't know.
155642	155922	All right.
155942	156362	Well, who knows?
156815	169065	Anyhow, we'll work with what we've got and also our little contingent over on Justin.TV on our feed there, which by the way, brand new addition to our Justin.TV arsenal.
169085	178692	We now have a video capture card, so when we bring you clips of games, we'll actually, instead of having to point the camera at the TV, the little getaway, we'll actually be able to run the feed from the TV.
178772	179573	That's very exciting.
179933	180714	Happy, happy, happy.
181462	182963	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
203973	204574	Good time.
204614	204974	What's that?
205295	208599	Stern is releasing a new Indiana Jones pinball machine.
209560	213765	And Dan said he'd even be willing to sell Creature of the Black Lagoon to obtain it.
214606	214986	Nice.
215206	216808	So that's going to be expensive, though.
216828	217549	A new machine?
217709	218530	A brand new machine.
218550	219411	You guys are crazy.
219832	222455	Well, he said he might even let go of Simpsons Pinball Party.
222735	223156	Wow.
223939	224419	Ragnarok Scrabble
253795	255516	I don't go on Facebook.
256176	258818	Facebook has a very Scrabble-like game.
258858	260499	In fact, I think they got in trouble for it.
260679	263761	It's actually an application called Scrabulous, is what it's called.
263781	266222	And you can play Scrabble with friends on Facebook, basically.
266742	271165	And as much as Facebook kind of bugs me, I do like being able to play Scrabble with friends online.
271945	273346	I don't know if it's the same one.
273406	276007	It was something that was linked to me.
276528	279109	But I was doing the solitaire mode on it.
279966	284270	I'm pretty sure you have to be a Facebook member to use Scrabulous, so it was probably something different.
284530	292837	I have a Facebook, but the last thing I actually did with it was through my phone when one of my friends in Mississippi found me in Facebook somehow and friended me.
293918	297802	You know, Jamie, I was just going to mention, I saw this earlier today and I thought of you guys.
298442	302626	Street Fighter 4, they're taking pre-orders on it right now for $2,590 with an $880 deposit.
307833	309134	for the arcade hardware.
309514	310455	Oh, for the machine.
310535	311936	I was like, for the game?
312416	312536	Oh.
313416	313837	Hmm.
315778	316018	So.
316358	318360	But what kind of machine do you have to put that in?
318420	320461	Well, normally the machines are $23,000.
320681	325244	So, I mean, it's probably, you know, but, I mean, come on, 2DX?
325704	329386	I mean, shit, that's just like a computer with like an HD screen attached to it and a sound system.
329446	335610	So, I mean, most of these things nowadays, you can probably hook it up to a TV and build your own control panel for it.
335630	336931	I don't think it's too sophisticated.
337981	340683	You just have to be able to run the... Well, let me know if you end up doing that, Jamie.
341324	343185	That's pretty hardcore, but then again...
365973	367314	Street Fighter IV Network ID Card vs. Communication Kit
395472	399693	I don't know if I only have $3,000 to throw around.
400554	401074	Of course I don't.
402054	404555	I probably wouldn't spend it on Street Fighter 4 because I suck at Street Fighter.
406976	408356	You know what I would do if I had that much money?
409516	411217	Make a down payment on a house and move.
412977	414658	You'd need more than $3,000 for a down payment.
416798	418499	I was thinking the cost of the cabinet.
418519	420740	$23,000, that would cover it.
423140	430562	Now, this week I didn't play a whole lot, I just played basically N+, a few lunches I played that.
430982	451748	That's fun, you know, it's just like N, and I think I'm like on the 10th level, but there's like 5 or 6 stages per level, so some of them are pretty hard, but that's N. And then the rest of the time I've been playing Smash Bros., but I've just basically been doing the Space Emissary mode, which...
452864	454685	is varying levels of cool and crap.
455085	455505	I don't know.
456165	464208	Like, sometimes I'm just like, oh, this is pretty good level design, and then some other times it's just like, uh, I don't know, this is pretty dumb.
464648	469290	But, overall, I'm still playing it, and I'm only halfway through it.
469390	470730	Actually, a little over halfway through it.
471530	476292	Um, but, other than that, I don't know.
477012	477472	It's pretty good.
479433	480853	How was M+, overall?
481073	482594	That's what some folks in chat are asking.
483759	494465	Uh, and plus, I like it, but I mean, it's not too different than just the regular N, except for the fact that, I don't know, different levels, that's it.
496706	506231	Alright, well, uh, moving on to my gaming week, um, you know, I've actually been kind of sick this week, which you would think would make me want to stay home and play a lot of games, but it kind of, eh, I don't know, it kind of,
506713	508274	Sucked my will to do a lot of things.
508314	511075	I've been having these weird pains all over my side.
511095	513076	I don't want to get into all the nasty details about it.
513116	519399	Basically, doctors don't even know what it is, and I've taken medication that have caused now side effects, blah, blah, blah.
519819	520459	It kind of sucks.
520519	523060	So, yeah, I didn't play a lot of games because of it.
523120	525782	I did play a few things, very random stuff.
525822	527462	Some of the things I played were very random.
527843	530564	I played Phantasy Star 2.
530624	535486	I decided to download on Virtual Console quite randomly, and I checked that out, and that was kind of cool.
536620	538842	and, uh, although, you know, I don't know.
539683	542865	Phantasy Star 2 wasn't quite as cool as Final Fantasy, but it was different.
543386	543986	It was kind of cool.
544247	547790	It was one of those games, because I never had a Genesis growing up, so it was kind of one of those games I missed.
548490	557518	Um, it's kind of neat, though, now that I've played Phantasy Star online to kind of see some of the history of the Phantasy Star universe and see where a lot of that stuff has come from, so that's kind of cool.
558238	560180	And, uh, let's see, what else have I checked out?
560720	563763	Uh, World of Warcraft, as always, you know, Addict and all that stuff.
564543	565184	And, um,
567136	570637	Let's see, what else have I played this week?
571058	571998	I'm totally drawing a blank.
572038	573799	I actually skipped out on Lost Odyssey this week.
573859	578720	Oh, I checked out Brain Challenge, that new Xbox Live Arcade game.
578740	579761	Yeah, it looked dumb.
579781	580681	It was kind of dumb.
581401	582702	The minigames were kind of dumb.
583922	587204	The minigames were just kind of... I don't know.
587424	587644	It just...
588331	594292	I guess if you don't have Brain Age on the DS or I don't know, the whole novelty of these brain training games is really worn off.
594332	596612	Let's face it, the market's been really oversaturated.
597153	600933	I guess this is the only type of it available on the Xbox 360.
601393	610195	If you must have a minigame collection for your very own on the Xbox 360, then you can go ahead and check that out.
611015	613495	But honestly, it's really nothing to scream about.
613956	616396	So that would be that.
617054	618315	That's really it for my gaming week.
642162	643363	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
666807	676655	Alright, so this week they officially announced that Super Mario Kart Wii will be coming to the US on April 27th.
676795	679237	That is two days before Grand Theft Auto 4.
680098	684982	But hey, I mean, people on the Wii, they don't get Grand Theft Auto 4, so you get Mario Kart Wii.
685883	689806	No cars being stolen in this game, but, you know, it's still pretty violent.
690427	695711	Anyways, some other cool stuff that you'll, of course, get the Wii wheel with this.
696087	698367	and it will also be sold separately on the side.
699668	716591	Apparently they're going to have 32 different courses up to 12 players online and media integration, 10 battle arenas and of course support for a bunch of different control methods much like Super Smash Bros.
716631	716891	Brawl.
718491	719531	So that's pretty awesome.
719551	721612	I plan on picking them both though.
725486	728608	I noticed some of the retro levels are making an appearance in Mario Kart.
728628	729549	That's kind of interesting.
729729	730589	Some of them are pretty cool.
730990	736213	IGN actually had some footage of five levels that they had in their pre-release copy.
736233	738475	I don't know what you call it, Alpha or whatever.
739215	745500	And they've got Course 4 from the Super Nintendo Mario Kart.
746240	747361	And that's pretty awesome looking.
747461	751744	Then they had a remake of the Block Fort from Nintendo 64.
753703	754704	Although it looks a little different, though.
754724	757045	It's not just a direct remake of it.
757606	760928	They've got a bunch of additional stuff on there, but it's still blocked for it.
761488	764690	And then... Let's see what else was there.
765831	767232	Some of the ones I didn't play, though.
767252	772055	They had one from the Game Boy Advance one, which I don't remember any of the battle modes in the Game Boy Advance one.
772876	779020	And there's also some from Double Dash and the DS one.
779680	782042	But to be honest, Double Dash is...
783584	788106	Jaded says, between that and Brawl, I can say goodbye to my bank account.
810630	812471	I'm probably going to mispronounce this name, I apologize.
812551	819674	Queltippo, I think that's how you say it, Queltippo, says the Wii wheel is about as useful as jamming the Wiimote into a giant pretzel.
820955	823716	And you can do that, too, as long as the pretzel is sideways.
824216	828358	You can actually use a pretzel as a Wii steering wheel.
828878	830439	We should do that on the show, that would be fun.
830519	831379	That might be kind of fun.
831399	835301	I was going to say, one thing that's not delicious... Mmm, yummy!
838092	838652	I'm going to do that.
838672	844777	Maybe we can also do the Wii Cinnabon and alternate controller methods.
845257	846057	That'd be sticky.
846177	847358	That would be kind of messy.
847378	848459	You could use a hamburger bun.
849059	849640	It's circular.
851141	855904	I was going to say, one thing that's not coming, though, to Mario Kart Wii is snaking.
856024	857785	And I know I'm very happy about that.
858206	865110	Apparently, according to the official Nintendo magazine in the UK, snaking is gone.
865150	867632	They've changed how the...
868553	876377	Boosting is done, I guess, around corners and no longer will you be able to speed boost by waggling the controls left and right as you power slide.
877137	882600	This has, I guess, been scrapped and now your speed boost is determined by how long you can hold the slide.
883701	885461	I'm sure someone will find a different way to do it.
885601	887262	I'm sure it will be exploited one way or another.
887542	888683	But, hey, that's kind of neat.
889565	895228	Of course, now, you know how our chat room works, and a little joke comes up, and then everybody exploits it best they can.
895268	899431	We've got Wii Churro, Wii Tortilla, Wii Hot Dog Bun.
899451	905314	I'd actually kind of use Wii Hot Dog Bun, I guess, for Mario Kart controls.
906154	907135	What else did I want to read here?
907495	911217	SSJ100Matt says, Mario Kart Wii looks like it's ripped from the arcade version.
911818	915520	I kind of hope not, because the arcade version, I don't know, it just doesn't have that same feel to me.
916100	917481	The arcade version feels...
918948	919969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
948905	949545	Thanks for watching!
966724	971587	You know, Mario Kart Wii isn't the only thing to get excited about this year if you're a Nintendo fan.
972168	977011	Reggie Fils-Aimé is dropping some hints that there's a big holiday game coming out this year.
977411	980333	Of course, I mean, obviously every company's got to have their big holiday game.
980673	983575	It will be revealed at this year's E3.
983976	988439	That's right, he mentioned this in an interview with Jeff Keighley on Game Trailers TV.
988839	996464	He says that the second half of 08's lineup will be announced at E3, which will probably include this year's big holiday title.
996964	997485	Who knows?
1000468	1002310	Some things that Reggie was asked about.
1002410	1004031	The orchestra conductor demo.
1004311	1007775	Remember that thing you saw at the very first E3 where we showed up?
1008215	1009657	Which was the last E3 most of us went to.
1009697	1010137	Yeah, with music.
1010357	1010738	Yeah, who...
1012901	1014762	Don't know if that's actually going to be a full game yet.
1014782	1019303	I mean, we did hear about that Wii music game, but there was never any word if the conductor thing was a part of that.
1019643	1020263	It is, yeah.
1020463	1020844	Oh, is it?
1020964	1021844	Yeah, that's the game.
1022104	1027466	Oh, well, they asked him, Reggie, point blank about this, and Reggie said, who knows, maybe that's one of the things we'll talk about at E3.
1027846	1029026	Kind of dodging the question.
1029086	1029786	Lame!
1030347	1033028	He also dodged a question about Donkey Kong Wii.
1034128	1034288	So...
1034952	1035392	No thanks.
1035873	1038575	I'm sorry, Donkey Kong Bunga Blast sucked enough.
1038615	1040136	I don't need another Donkey Kong game.
1040416	1048442	Reggie did say that all the E3 releases, or actually, sorry, post-E3 releases will be, quote, maximizing all of our key franchises.
1048922	1055507	So you can bet it's going to be either like an F-Zero game, the Animal Crossing game, which most people are speculating.
1055607	1056968	I would bet it's the Animal Crossing game.
1056988	1058349	It's going to be their big holiday title.
1058890	1059570	That's what I think.
1059831	1063453	And what other big franchises have they still got to milk?
1063814	1064214	Kirby.
1064234	1064354	Kirby.
1064727	1066388	Ever really milked Kirby on the Wii yet, have they?
1066689	1066909	No.
1067730	1069431	They did milk Kirby on the DS, but not yet.
1070452	1075676	I think there's going to be some type of Animal Crossing that will have some nifty little online feature that's going to make everybody want it.
1076817	1078418	I say Animal Crossing Wii is their big title.
1078539	1080560	They better fucking release Excite Truck 2.
1082202	1084263	What if F-Zero was kind of Excite Truck-ish?
1084824	1085444	It's not.
1086385	1089688	I'm sorry, that's like saying wipeouts, you know, like Excite Truck.
1089848	1090308	It's not.
1090468	1091129	It's just eh.
1092367	1093487	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1115149	1120314	Animal Crossing, not really for the hardcore gamers, but that sounds feasible that they would do that.
1120554	1124978	And every single Animal Crossing game I've ever heard of has always come out around that time of the year.
1125518	1127420	So, you know, that'd be my guess.
1128440	1131083	And because they're whores like that and they would want to do that.
1131223	1134746	And now, especially once we get to that point in, you know...
1135615	1136455	Dark Horse Candidate Kid Icarus
1160066	1161887	I think that's coming, but I don't think that's going to be it.
1162587	1164128	I have a feeling it's going to come back.
1164188	1166629	I mean, it just worked so well in Smash Bros.
1166829	1173092	I mean, you watch some of those cinematics and play some of those stages, and you're like, God damn, they could put out a Kid Icarus game on the Wii and it would be awesome.
1173752	1176994	Or as Actdeft says in chat, Kid Icarus.
1178955	1181376	Mario RPG, that would be fucking awesome.
1184484	1190951	D.Va and Chad says, Microsoft took all the DK platformer game rights after they purchased Rare.
1191792	1193914	Odd1 says, yeah, it's probably Animal Crossing.
1193934	1196277	They said at the end of the anime movie that it'd be coming.
1197707	1199368	It's also kind of one of those obvious things.
1199408	1202991	Like, someday there will be another Zelda game and another Mario game.
1203011	1206453	I just wish, though, that Nintendo would come up with a new franchise.
1207494	1208575	I'm all down with that, too.
1208675	1210036	I think they should come up with a new franchise.
1210196	1213779	Because it's nice, you know, that we get a new Mario game, a new Metroid game.
1213799	1216941	But it's like, you know, you take all the surprise out of things.
1216961	1222446	Because we know that there's going to be... Every time you're going to put out a new system, there's obviously going to be a Mario game and that kind of stuff.
1222486	1223787	But, you know, it's like with...
1224757	1224997	What?
1225077	1226258	The PlayStation stuff.
1226318	1229159	I guess there's always going to be a new Ratchet and Clank and that kind of crap.
1229959	1234120	Yeah, to be fair, Nintendo does seem to put out a few original IPs that do rather well.
1234561	1238842	I mean, let's see, they had the Donkey Kong Bongo game, Pikmin.
1239942	1241943	They had, what else?
1241963	1245144	I'm trying to think of the GameCube era that came out.
1245784	1246985	I guess not Luigi's Mansion.
1247005	1247345	I don't know.
1247725	1248605	But, you know, I don't know.
1249226	1251567	I think it's possible for them to come up with some new stuff.
1251947	1252727	I mean, they've done it before.
1254332	1255052	WarioWare?
1255232	1256073	Was that on GameCube?
1256113	1258093	No, that started on Game Boy Advance, didn't it?
1259053	1260434	That was fun on GameCube, wasn't it?
1260454	1261494	It was pretty fun on the GameCube.
1261814	1265235	But, I mean, they're capable of churning out some new stuff once in a while when they really want to.
1266156	1266976	Wii Sports 2!
1268096	1270257	We're gonna whore that franchise like a bitch.
1270337	1273318	Well, let's... Wii Sports is kind of a new IP, right?
1274798	1276119	That could be a holiday title, too.
1276179	1277099	Why not Wii Sports 2?
1277999	1280060	You know, Soccer Moms Across America would eat that shit up.
1280080	1281520	Because they're gonna whore it like a bitch.
1281560	1282541	I'm trademarking that.
1283201	1283341	Alright.
1284338	1287019	Alright, well, we'll see at this year's E3.
1287640	1294903	Well, for things that we said we would stop and wait and see on, it looks like Manhunt 2 is getting a UK release after all.
1297364	1307509	According to the BBFC, they have no alternative but to give the 18 certificate to it, because basically, I guess they were overruled.
1308370	1310431	It was actually a twice...
1311560	1315744	Rejected, and it went up for review again, and they said, okay, we have to.
1317626	1318767	So they finally just caved?
1320148	1320789	Pretty much.
1320809	1322250	That's kind of interesting.
1322630	1333040	It was actually the Video Appeals Committee gave their own review, and so because they've decided it should come out, it's going to come out.
1334161	1334421	Okay.
1336252	1345909	I guess I'm not too surprised by this, but what kind of makes me think that maybe they finally decided to let it come out is maybe they saw what happened in America is that the game came out and nobody cared because the game kind of sucked.
1346963	1347683	Blurring, crazy lighting gone
1371929	1399786	whatever too bad the game sucks and you know it's not worth playing do we have any I know we don't have a whole lot of overseas listeners that listen live but are any of our overseas listeners planning on purchasing this game overseas I bet I'm going to hear a lot of no's you don't want it do yourself a favor but there's no release date announced for it yet if you want to see something like if you want to play a game kind of like that I guess and more fun maybe try the Godfather game and maybe no more heroes or just wait for something better
1400578	1400998	There you go.
1401359	1401759	Even better.
1401959	1402499	Something better.
1402980	1403360	I like that.
1403400	1404381	Something better, the game.
1404741	1406202	That could be the new Nintendo IP.
1406242	1406782	Something better.
1406903	1407583	Something better.
1409144	1410065	You're gonna buy it.
1410485	1411946	Yeah.
1413407	1420913	So we may be getting WiiWare in May, but of course Japan being super awesome and everything, they get it March 25th.
1421493	1424275	And they're gonna be launching with quite a few games.
1424795	1428458	Right now they've got, of course, some of these...
1429093	1434057	Okiraku Ping Pong Wii Word Puzzle Mojipitan Sakusaku Animal Panic
1450672	1452733	by Konami, 4,000 points.
1453293	1454454	Star Soldier... What?
1454474	1455234	4,000 points?
1455334	1455754	1,000 points.
1456195	1457955	Oh, I thought you said 4,000.
1457995	1458936	I'm like, fuck that.
1459196	1460236	Ain't worth buying that.
1460336	1460677	Okay.
1461537	1464718	Star Soldier R by Hudson for 800 points.
1465379	1470641	My Life as a King, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for 1,500 points.
1472062	1474843	Angel Solitaire by G-Mode for 500 points.
1475343	1478745	Dr. Mario and Baculus Extermination...
1480219	1480440	4,000 points.
1480480	1481000	I love that name.
1481020	1481700	Sounds painful.
1482301	1483041	Imbaculous.
1484923	1488465	Everybody's Pokemon Ranch for 1,000 points.
1488745	1492028	And Longpuss by Genki for 1,000 points.
1493168	1493729	So that's not bad.
1494509	1497051	I don't know.
1497491	1498692	I'm kind of looking forward to the service.
1498732	1500794	It'll be interesting to see what kind of games are on there.
1500934	1501975	When are we supposed to be getting that here?
1502055	1502675	Did they say May?
1502795	1503155	It was like May...
1505091	1506932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1526653	1527173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1546055	1553099	I guess maybe that's a stupid question because, you know, a lot of games that you might buy on the PC and stuff don't have a lot of those types of frills, especially the casual type games.
1553479	1554219	But, you know, I don't know.
1554699	1562263	I think now in this day and age, part of the charms of, you know, having the online connections and online gaming is getting to somewhat compete with friends.
1562283	1562684	I don't know.
1562864	1567866	I really don't like the way that Nintendo handles their online, especially the friend stuff, the friend codes.
1567886	1568767	That's got to go.
1569047	1569167	Right.
1569627	1570227	Well, we'll see.
1570488	1574970	I mean, when the service actually launches in Japan, which is very, very soon...
1575831	1576572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1596522	1602107	All right, well, in the meantime, we do know some more details about some of the other games that will be coming out on the WiiWare.
1602188	1603329	One of them is Tetris.
1604129	1608033	Tetris Online will be coming on the WiiWare, and you can play it with up to six players.
1608694	1610636	And I'm guessing since it's called...
1611272	1612333	Thanks for watching!
1630886	1635148	So I'm assuming, yeah, some of these games are going to be online, which is a little better now.
1635588	1639329	So if you need another version of Tetris, you'll be able to play that on the Wii very soon.
1639669	1648172	One thing I want to point out, though, based on some of these screenshots I'm looking at that's kind of cool, I'm looking at one particular two-player mode, and it looks like the wells aren't separated.
1648212	1651614	It actually looks like the wells are combined into one giant well.
1651654	1656975	So I'm not sure if there's a two-player mode where maybe both players play one giant board at the same time.
1657456	1658356	That's kind of interesting.
1658752	1660914	A different spin on a well-known formula.
1661174	1661394	Yeah.
1661734	1666077	So, it looks like this game might bring some new things to the table, which is a good thing.
1666418	1669099	I just asked about why I would need these types of games.
1669420	1670300	Puzzle Fighter Wii.
1670420	1670981	That'd be awesome.
1671001	1672342	With, like, Street Fighter 4 characters.
1672442	1672842	You never know.
1673182	1675104	RossDLUT comments in the chat room.
1675124	1677285	Chat.OrangeLuncher.com Ooh, Tetris.
1677345	1679327	That's so new and independent.
1681744	1687026	Well, in a way, if you think about the history of Tetris, it actually is a very independent game at its roots.
1687126	1688226	But, I mean, I get the point.
1688346	1689366	Obviously, it's not that anymore.
1690427	1692707	People are still playing fucking Pac-Man Championship Edition.
1692767	1694328	That's just Pac-Man with neon lights.
1694608	1696909	I mean, that's all it fucking is.
1697669	1699389	But Pac-Man Championship Edition is kind of rad.
1699489	1699910	I don't know.
1700090	1700850	There's something about it.
1700930	1703711	It's not just neon lights and rave music.
1705671	1711313	You know, all they need to do now is come out with the Pac-Man DS system and all you whores will buy it like nothing.
1712550	1717836	Dark Tetsuya comments in the chat room that Rob, they actually had that mode that I'm describing there on Tengen Tetris.
1718377	1721400	Remember the Forbidden Tetris on the NES many years ago?
1721420	1722181	I have it.
1722201	1724664	That got cut up on a licensing debacle?
1724784	1727286	That would be even a better name for this online version.
1727487	1728628	Forbidden Tetris.
1728948	1730069	Forbidden Tetris.
1731651	1732692	I have Tengen Tetris.
1733033	1733213	Yeah?
1733233	1733313	Yeah.
1733570	1734670	Yes, I do.
1735131	1736531	So you own Forbidden Tetris.
1736771	1737371	Yes, I do.
1737571	1739012	I want Tangram Tetris.
1740032	1741213	That would be fascinating.
1741413	1744694	Whatever happened to the really shitty Tetris knockoffs we got?
1744874	1747895	Remember when Tetris got really popular in the early 90s or so?
1748275	1751956	We got tons of just shitty, shitty ripoffs.
1752016	1756378	We had Word Triss and Hat Triss and Face Triss.
1756398	1757458	But Blast Triss was real.
1757998	1758719	Well Triss.
1760699	1762140	Tetris 2 Bomb Bliss.
1763143	1766146	Blastrous was fun because you could shoot things.
1767687	1768928	Shooting always makes things better, right?
1768948	1769989	It was a SuperScope game.
1770729	1771010	Alright.
1771090	1771950	That was what made it cool.
1771970	1773892	Alright, enough reminiscing, I'm sorry.
1774212	1781518	Well, something else that is cool, and this is particularly cool for me, because I love Hudson, and they're bringing us a real Bomberman.
1782339	1790366	Well, okay, it's for WiiWare, and it actually is a real Bomberman.
1790406	1791507	I mean, we're talking about
1792553	1794254	Up to eight players in one game.
1794894	1796195	At least that's what Famitsu says.
1796875	1801657	It's going to be out in Japan in June, so hopefully we'll get it.
1801757	1803537	Not too long, I hope.
1804198	1805318	But it's Bomberman.
1806529	1807570	I love Bomberman!
1808110	1809270	Oh, Bomberman Act Zero?
1825024	1826265	as in piece of shit Bomberman.
1826285	1826745	Yeah, yeah, I know.
1826946	1829708	And maybe that kind of just ruined Bomberman for me.
1830889	1833491	Like it's like watching your childhood get raped right in front of your eyes.
1833791	1842758	We still regularly break out the Super Nintendo and the Multitap and play, you know, Bomberman 2, Super Bomberman 2.
1842958	1845620	I'm thinking more of the recent Xbox Live one.
1845660	1849363	Remember how they had a Bomberman come out on Xbox Live and it was pretty faithful to the original?
1849883	1853666	I just, my resounding reaction to the game was, meh.
1854480	1857942	This is an actual... Hudson.
1858102	1859222	It's Hudson!
1859342	1860023	Listen, Hudson.
1860683	1861524	We play Bomberman.
1862764	1864765	On every system that's ever been made, ever.
1865686	1866926	And then some.
1867727	1869507	And then you release four versions of it.
1869888	1870188	Listen.
1872229	1878592	I know that it might seem like a good idea to release a lot of these each year, because, you know, you need money.
1879192	1879953	I understand that.
1880573	1880793	But...
1881297	1889380	I'm reading something else on here on the actual Famitsu article and from what I can see you can actually play as your me as a character in this game oh in that case I gotta buy that
1912391	1914532	I sense that comment has a hint of sarcasm.
1914872	1919575	Well, no, I'm just trying to pick out what I can actually read on this.
1919675	1921515	That is kind of cool, to be honest.
1921615	1923316	I think that is an interesting feature.
1923877	1924397	I don't know why.
1924577	1933201	Can I mail away for an actual bomb piece of plastic that I can put on my Wii remote so that I can pretend I'm the real Bomberman?
1933942	1934743	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1953703	1958044	DarkSakura, somebody is in your fan club in chat.
1958064	1959264	Somebody is on your side here.
1959965	1963005	Odd1 in chat says, Bomberman is like Metal Slug.
1963085	1964686	I only want more, dammit.
1964706	1965746	Yes, okay.
1967406	1975488	Okay, you know that if I really like a game, I tend to like the entire series of it, no matter how much repetition it has.
1976539	1977819	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2000003	2001965	which I'll get into later in the show.
2002406	2007211	Here's my suggestion, though, for how to make Bomberman a little more appealing to people like me.
2008052	2009433	Forbidden Bomberman.
2010374	2010995	He's on to something.
2012270	2013791	and Blood Effect.
2014471	2015891	I'm working on the wrong side of gaming.
2015931	2017932	I shouldn't be bitching about games like I do on the show.
2017952	2018973	I should be making games.
2019233	2020893	Show of hands in chat.
2020953	2022194	Forbidden Bomberman.
2022514	2025895	Y or N. Here's what you need to do.
2025975	2029997	This is a small bit of innovation and it's ripping a little bit off of Taito, but who cares.
2031157	2033258	Bomberman mixed with Rampage.
2033598	2036059	You're blowing up cities and you're fighting each other.
2036400	2037360	Who doesn't want that?
2037970	2041752	People like blowing things up, but they want a little bit more than just blowing up little cartoon characters.
2041812	2043293	We need to take out, like, cities.
2043733	2044374	I like Rampage.
2044414	2046875	We need to quit our damn jobs and start a gaming company.
2048036	2049316	You are on a goldmine here.
2049576	2050957	Bomberman mixed with Rampage.
2051037	2051417	Genius.
2051958	2052738	Forbidden Bomberman.
2052758	2055120	Who doesn't like to blow up cities full of innocent people?
2055560	2056000	In games.
2056540	2057461	Only in game form.
2057661	2058481	Not in real life.
2059002	2059842	Just in game form.
2060282	2061083	Great stress reliever.
2061903	2062784	Bomber Rampage.
2064585	2064905	Alright.
2066146	2066466	Anyhow.
2067864	2068384	and DarkSakura.com
2094022	2094663	POPPING BUBBLE WRAP
2110854	2111194	Awesome.
2111434	2112635	You know... I have bubble wrap at my desk.
2112675	2113896	How about the real thing?
2113956	2122741	Like, I like popping real... Honestly, this reminds me of when I went to Barnes & Noble like ten years ago and found a big, thick book full of fat bubble wrap.
2123041	2125302	I'm not joking, and it was called Stress Relief Book.
2127803	2129044	I am not kidding.
2130285	2132386	Are we sure there's not more to this?
2132466	2137609	Like, maybe it just looks like it's a bubble wrap popping game, but maybe there's more to it that we just don't know about yet?
2138209	2140270	I mean, with this bad translation thing gone wrong?
2140706	2141187	I don't think so.
2141227	2142688	It's put out by Namco Bandai.
2142969	2145511	So Pac-Man's going to come out and eat it.
2145691	2153119	For less than that, though, I could go to See's Candies because we all know the best part of See's Candy is that you get the little bubble wrap with everything you buy.
2154258	2155158	is that only in California?
2155418	2176164	I think so well then you know what I had never heard of C's until I moved here okay the national and international people can just deal for a minute here California only for a minute here it's like getting something in the mail the best part of C's candy is that you get a little piece of bubble wrap in the pack with the candy I mean think about it for ten bucks I get a little box of candy and not only do I have real bubble wrap to pop but I also have wait for it
2176923	2177483	Candy!
2178104	2178584	Hello!
2178844	2179805	Here's the best part though.
2179925	2187150	There's 40 levels that you'll be able to play and of course it features vibration feedback.
2190032	2195756	Yeah, and in fact they have a little link here on asovision.com slash puttyputty.
2196196	2202861	You can watch a little movie of this stupid little bubble wrap thing which, oh my god.
2205963	2206283	You're like,
2206840	2207740	Thanks for watching!
2224967	2227308	I forgot, every time you go into seas, they actually give you a free sample.
2227348	2228129	Free is the best part.
2228809	2236453	Let's see, Queltippo, who has a name I'm probably still mispronouncing in chat, says, Will it be like Gal's Panic, and after you pop the bubble wrap, you see a naked girl?
2236893	2238374	No, this has a picture of tea.
2241036	2242456	Oh, hooray, a picture of tea.
2243457	2245238	Oh my god, this is great, I want one.
2245974	2246374	Oh my god.
2246394	2249015	And it looks like this website sells them in five different colors.
2249195	2251915	White, blue, pink, orange, and black.
2252296	2253876	Hell, we can sell orange ones.
2253896	2255336	I want one to annoy people at work with.
2256677	2257637	I'm totally going to get one.
2258077	2263058	Well, let's talk about more incredibly awesome games that you can be spending your money on in the near future.
2264418	2270460	There is a new game that is coming out on the DS, and it's called Babysitting Mania.
2272100	2274521	It's actually a game that you can play on the...
2275014	2276756	Thank you for watching!
2296508	2298328	Find out if you're the ultimate babysitter.
2298368	2306270	What if you didn't expect was 20 of the craziest houses you've ever imagined being... And if the babies don't behave, then they get beat mania.
2308571	2309071	Now, now.
2310091	2310871	That's not cool.
2312892	2313212	Alright.
2314272	2316373	Yeah, but apparently they're porting that to the DS.
2316493	2316833	Why?
2317673	2319754	Because there's money in them DSs.
2319914	2320594	Apparently.
2321074	2321614	Apparently.
2323014	2325475	I think if one person buys it, they'll make back their budget.
2326621	2327021	I guess.
2355709	2361591	and the same Bill the Cat because, you know, we're coming up on election season and I used to vote for Bill the Cat.
2361831	2364632	And plus, Bill the Cat in the game would actually be kind of cooler, I'm sorry.
2364752	2371774	He'd just walk around spitting on things and hacking up hairballs and then getting drunk with, I guess, hot naked chicks or something.
2372874	2382777	But no, Big the Cat is definitely going to be in it and it's, of course, being put out by BioWare and...
2383889	2391772	People, basically, the co-founder who they were interviewing, Ray, is it pronounced Musica, I guess?
2391972	2398254	Anyway, you know, they actually asked him, you know, well, a lot of people don't like these characters.
2398274	2404756	He's like, well, the whole point is to make you attach an emotion to the character and dislike is an emotion.
2405796	2407037	It's like, okay.
2407057	2407417	Okay.
2408300	2417467	Anyway, he says that all the characters are going to be really pivotal to the game, and it's not like a whole bunch of little mini-games, but something that's fully interactive.
2419268	2422571	I guess... I don't know how I feel about that.
2422731	2426473	I actually thought that Big's part of the game was the most annoying part of Sonic Adventure.
2427514	2428755	Here, Froggy.
2430817	2432738	It should stop making retarded Sonic characters.
2433759	2433919	Like...
2434793	2437095	Amy was cool because she walked around smacking stuff with a hammer.
2437495	2438076	That was cool.
2438496	2439537	Knuckles, cool.
2440758	2442159	Mecha Sonic, really cool.
2443359	2445241	But, no.
2446400	2449561	Can I take the show on a completely random, unrelated tangent for just a minute?
2449601	2450281	Oh, I know.
2450881	2451742	I know what you're preaching.
2451782	2452622	That's the best thing.
2453202	2453702	Here's the thing.
2453722	2457983	When you were talking about Build the Cat, I started thinking about all these comic book cats, right?
2458003	2462125	I'm like, oh, then there's like Felix the Cat and there's all these other cats, right?
2462145	2463225	Felix the Cat is great, though.
2463645	2468667	But then I thought about Garfield and that made me think about Garfield minus Garfield.
2468727	2469627	Have you seen this cartoon?
2469647	2470147	Yes, I have.
2471305	2472586	It's the best thing ever.
2472706	2473407	They're more funny.
2474307	2474868	Exactly.
2474888	2476349	Because Garfield's not funny.
2476729	2478971	But if you take out Garfield, it's actually really funny.
2479071	2479991	And there's this blog.
2480152	2480852	All the ones with normal.
2481833	2483674	There's this blog all about it.
2483734	2490159	It's Garfield-Garfield.tumblr.com Whatever happened to our website of the week segment?
2490919	2492740	It became the classic video game of the week segment.
2492900	2493341	You know what?
2493361	2494622	We need to just for a minute here.
2498894	2502217	I'm hijacking the website of the week segment.
2502597	2507801	My website of the week is garfield-garfield.tumblr.com Check it out.
2507861	2508862	It's hilarity.
2510163	2512105	Maybe you'll link it in the chat room for people.
2512285	2512665	Oh, sure.
2512685	2513966	I'll do that for you guys right now.
2514927	2515707	Sorry, live listeners.
2516688	2517049	There you go.
2518370	2518830	Anyway, sorry.
2518850	2522533	There's your completely random off-the-subject tangent for tonight.
2522773	2523073	There you go.
2526996	2527177	Sorry.
2529905	2531266	So, uh... No, it's okay.
2531386	2534248	Network problems, random tangents, sickness.
2534288	2536570	This show has it all tonight, I mean, honestly.
2536590	2547497	I was just gonna... Before you broke off on that whole Garfield thing, I was starting to say that Sonic and his friends are kind of reminding me, like, Godzilla and the other monsters, you know?
2547577	2552501	Like, they had the staple monsters that they made, and then they just started getting ridiculous with the monsters, you know?
2552541	2552661	Just...
2553251	2554332	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2584904	2585545	Right.
2610456	2622201	and it will actually track how much you're exercising throughout the day or how much you're jiggling, I guess, and then track your progress throughout the DS title.
2623321	2630845	And I'm not sure if they also have some exercises or something that talks you through, but I guess that's kind of neat.
2632965	2633446	Kind of.
2633906	2634406	A little bit.
2636147	2636447	I guess.
2637349	2637549	WTF L-O-L
2658809	2659590	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2673599	2676540	Somebody in the room will write a challenge on their DS.
2676640	2679882	Like, for instance, the screenshot I'm looking at says, Draw Panda Bear.
2680502	2686724	And then within a time limit, everybody else in the room has to draw... It sounds like Pictionary to me.
2687164	2689825	And then everybody votes on the winner, and then you go to the next challenge.
2689925	2690126	Okay.
2691446	2697548	At first, this sounded cool, because it reminded me a lot of Apples to Apples, where you would do something like that.
2698769	2701450	But then I just started looking at this and thinking about it,
2702182	2704823	Can't you do this already in PictoChat?
2704963	2710245	I mean, couldn't you, I don't know, do the exact same thing just with like a little egg timer?
2710465	2712046	Or better yet, here's the thing.
2712106	2715387	Here's how you can play LOL without even a Nintendo DS.
2715847	2718008	It's called Pen and Paper.
2721260	2722180	What do I need to do this?
2722240	2725382	You would actually need to get some pens and some paper.
2725962	2728564	Can I use any type of pens or certain pens will work for this?
2728584	2730385	Probably a pen that would show up.
2730405	2734347	You wouldn't want to use a pink pen because that's kind of hard to see unless you want to go for LOL value.
2734828	2736228	But make sure you have a pen.
2736288	2740091	And the paper, it could be lined paper or grid paper or blank paper.
2740171	2745494	If people do insist on having it in a virtual environment, open Canvas.
2746795	2750779	Hi, you can network on open canvas and everyone can draw on the same picture.
2751620	2753842	Now, what do we need to do to get the word out about this pen and paper?
2753862	2756725	That Yahoo chat thingy with the draw board is hilarious.
2756785	2758427	Or freaking Oikaki.
2759027	2761570	I really think you're onto something with this pen and paper.
2762150	2762771	I'm not sure, though.
2762851	2763071	I know.
2763111	2763652	I'm telling you.
2763712	2768036	Look, think of what OLR Productions has come up with in the scope of just a few weeks.
2768276	2769778	We have Forbidden Bomberman.
2770270	2775391	We have the pen and paper version of LOL, which we can totally undercut these guys putting it out on DS.
2776012	2779273	And remember, we're the ones that thought of LaserCats the game.
2780413	2780633	True.
2781113	2781733	I'm telling you.
2782694	2784054	EA's going to buy us tomorrow.
2784234	2785134	It's just a matter of time.
2786255	2787035	Just a matter of time.
2788275	2789596	And how we'll sell.
2792096	2795877	Let's have T in chat says, pen and paper is the wave of the future.
2797278	2797718	Yeah.
2799404	2807710	So, how about the wave of the future that is actually not necessarily in ours anytime soon?
2809451	2811573	Guess who else is getting Wii Fit before us?
2814134	2814775	Let's see.
2814955	2818537	How about, I don't know, what's a country we don't hear about very often in the news?
2818657	2820619	How about... Slovakia?
2821597	2823818	How about the country of Chad in Africa?
2823938	2825719	Is Chad getting the game before we are?
2825819	2826980	No, but they're getting it in Australia.
2827420	2828960	Chad ruined our elections.
2829301	2830721	Same thing, right?
2830761	2832122	Chad, Australia, what's the difference?
2832182	2832982	Australia's cool.
2833202	2833762	I'm just kidding.
2834323	2835463	I love Australia, of course I do.
2835543	2838985	And we did get Priscilla, Queen of the Desert from them.
2839405	2839805	That's true.
2839865	2843487	One of my favorite movies ever is Muriel's Wedding, I have to say.
2844267	2845168	And Olivia Newton-John.
2845708	2845968	Anyway.
2847563	2848664	Actdeft hit the nail on the head.
2848684	2851206	Without Australia, you would never have The Dingo Ate My Baby.
2851266	2852027	You would never have that.
2877122	2878463	Or the Didgeridoo Techno.
2879064	2879564	Exactly.
2881706	2886609	Let's take a moment to salute our Australian fans and their history.
2886689	2887390	Their great history.
2887790	2888491	Thank you, Australia.
2889311	2890412	From OLR.
2890612	2896177	So see, Australia, because of their greatness and contributions to culture, they get the game a little early.
2896217	2897798	I thought that was very nice of Nintendo to do.
2898639	2898919	Right.
2899759	2901481	Well, anyway, they're getting it on May 8th.
2901561	2902502	We're getting ours on May 19th.
2902522	2902582	And...
2905020	2912804	It should be coming out for $150 Australian, which is, the equivalence is 140 here, or 91 Euro.
2914465	2916185	It's already sold over a million.
2916205	2917906	Our dollar went to shit, didn't it?
2919967	2923629	Our dollar really, really went to shit sometime in the past couple years, didn't it?
2923649	2926010	You know, if it gets any worse, we're going to have to start calling it pesos.
2926290	2927611	Oh my God.
2928251	2928551	Sorry.
2929832	2931913	So, you know, I could go to Europe, and I could work.
2933126	2938227	I could go to Europe like people from Mexico come here to earn money and come back rich.
2939107	2939627	That'd be great.
2939787	2944648	Anyway, like I was saying, it's already sold over a million units in Japan.
2945789	2954871	It's coming out on April 25th in Europe for £69.99 in the UK and €89.99 everywhere else in Europe.
2955231	2958631	And we're getting it on the 19th of May.
2959191	2962232	So that gets the whatever award for me, but
2962901	2963261	I don't know.
2964061	2965322	Congratulations, Australia.
2966643	2971444	You've beat out Europe and America.
2972065	2972785	Kudos to you.
2972965	2974546	They're just trying to make it fair, I guess.
2975686	2976046	I don't know.
2976246	2977947	Kirpok can ask a question.
2977987	2979308	What is the capital of Australia?
2982029	2982369	Sydney?
2982549	2982709	Nope.
2982969	2984009	That's the most common mistake.
2984050	2986210	It's just like, but like, see, I can, it's Canberra.
2986230	2986811	It's Canberra.
2987191	2991292	But here's the thing is that, but you could do the same thing is that like quick Australian listeners.
2991553	2992573	What's the capital of Florida?
2994622	2995643	How many of you said Miami?
2996844	2997344	It's not.
2997464	2997884	It's not.
2997965	2998685	It's Tallahassee.
2999125	2999406	Right.
3000266	3000847	Just saying.
3000887	3001407	You'd be wrong.
3001447	3004710	Miami is the capital of where old folks go to die.
3004870	3006691	Miami is also the capital of cocaine.
3006731	3007091	Come on.
3009053	3009693	I'm kidding.
3010494	3011195	Love Miami.
3011475	3012035	Love you guys.
3012435	3013516	When have you been to Miami?
3014917	3017960	Actually, I went to their airport once on my way to Jamaica.
3018600	3022283	I have been to Miami thousands of times thanks to the power of television.
3024062	3026765	I've actually been to Miami once, and I was two years old.
3028366	3030848	And SSJ100Matt has a perfect example.
3031109	3035473	You ask people what the capital of California is, hello, we live there, and most people don't know.
3035493	3039176	If you say Los Angeles, then you need to get your head out of your ass.
3041118	3043740	Hey, wait a minute, you said Sydney was the capital of Australia.
3043780	3044861	Get your head out of your ass.
3045602	3047083	But I don't live there, so I have an excuse.
3047123	3049065	Or get your ass out of your head, because it's Australia.
3049125	3049846	Get it upside down?
3050835	3052037	And the toilet flush backwards?
3052097	3053639	What the hell happened to tonight's show?
3053699	3055901	It's just not right.
3056222	3057343	I'm going to keep going then.
3057523	3057903	Please do.
3058943	3061465	There's a game that's coming out here in May pretty soon.
3061565	3062445	I'm pretty psyched about it.
3062485	3063486	It's called Blastworks.
3064687	3066468	Originally it was Tamiki Fighters.
3066508	3071111	Of course now it's been... It's very little like Tamiki Fighters now.
3071591	3073272	But still the same kind of concept.
3073773	3080157	What's kind of neat about it though is you'll actually... Of course the game has about 20 different levels you can play and stuff.
3080257	3084600	And plays a little bit like Katamari meets a really intense shooter game.
3085120	3088122	But now you'll be able to design completely new ships...
3088883	3093708	New levels, new enemies, new AI patterns, and new bullet patterns.
3093768	3100213	So, I mean, completely customizable, and you can share all this content over WeConnect24, which is pretty cool.
3100494	3104437	So some of the levels, I guess, they were just showing off to, like, Joystick, for example.
3104898	3113886	One of them looked like the environment was made out of paper, and you're actually flying a paper airplane and fighting other paper airplanes and origamis, enemies, and stuff like that.
3114366	3115227	So really cool stuff.
3116152	3123279	Plus the game itself also has unlockable versions of Tumiki Fighters and some of the other games made by Kenta Cho.
3124180	3130045	And if you're interested in checking out Tumiki Fighters, it's actually available for free on his website.
3130165	3133809	Just do a search for Tumiki Fighters and definitely check it out.
3134169	3136151	The game is slated to come out in the U.S.
3137652	3140355	in May, and I can't wait to check it out.
3142660	3143220	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3164724	3165344	That's pretty cool.
3165424	3168686	And I think this is going to be one of those games that a lot of people aren't going to know about.
3168986	3170507	It's one of those under-the-radar games.
3170607	3174949	Is it going to be one of those under-the-radar costs, where it's only $20, or do we know a price point on this yet?
3177030	3178630	If I remember correctly, I think it was like $39.99.
3178951	3181492	So it's kind of your typical wheat.
3182262	3184643	One step below your AAA Wii titles, basically.
3184883	3186743	But, I mean, I think the value's pretty good.
3186763	3197427	I mean, if it was just going to be a straight port of Tamaki Fighters, it might be a little high, but with all the, like, user-created stuff, I mean, you can get pretty crazy with this game, so... Alright, it'll be fun.
3197887	3201408	Very good gaming story to bring us back from our Capitals of the World discussion.
3201448	3202228	I appreciate that.
3202688	3204669	Loki's always working hard for OLR, isn't he?
3205429	3205809	Very good.
3206429	3207069	Yes.
3207109	3208310	But yeah, definitely, there's...
3209628	3210669	GameTrailers.com GameTrailers.com
3235339	3238401	But actually this will be the entirety of Japan is getting these releases.
3239301	3255929	This week in gaming on March 19th, they are getting on the Xbox 360 Armored Core for Answer, Army of Two, Blazing Angels 2, Need for Speed Pro Street, Sengoku Mosu 2, and that's quite a few Xbox 360 games for one week.
3256710	3257070	There you go.
3258365	3262269	Odd1 in chat says this is his favorite part of the show, Rob butchering the Japanese releases.
3262289	3264271	That's why I read them, because I can't pronounce any of them.
3265012	3268495	PlayStation 3, I can pronounce Armored Core, that's easy enough.
3268896	3276063	PlayStation 3 also gets Armored Core, also gets Arm Eve 2, also gets Blazing Angels 2, but gets another game, Folk Soul...
3279324	3296049	you might just know that as folklore but that's actually getting a price reduction that's already been out there it's just a price reduction also getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3 Resistance Ridge Racer 7 which I can't pronounce and Mobile Suit Gundam Target Insight all getting price reductions this week
3296855	3298797	and, uh, cheaper games is never bad news.
3299537	3306023	Uh, on the Nintendo Wii, speaking of price reductions, Bomberland Wii is moving into the best, but some new games coming out.
3306103	3308785	Spider-Man 3 just now coming out in Japan.
3309525	3317392	I would suggest you just pass on that, but maybe you want to pick up the House of the Dead 2 and 3 with the Wii Zapper, um, also being sold independently there.
3317832	3320795	Uh, Dekasporta also coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan.
3321555	3323517	Moving on to the PlayStation 2, uh,
3325621	3330285	Nothing really new coming out there, just some price reductions on the Godfather and Kamiwaza.
3331126	3334949	Something to look forward to next week is the Metal Gear Solid collection, if you're looking out for that.
3335290	3336291	Let's check out the handhelds.
3336351	3340995	Moving on to the Nintendo DS, Bangayo Spirits comes out this week in Japan.
3341015	3341095	Yay!
3342155	3345698	Cho Naketsu, Koku Kunio-kun, Dodgeball comes out.
3345818	3348660	This is going to be a fun week for Japan.
3349100	3356305	Coming out from Konami, Kachishima Kosaku DS, Dekuru Otoko no Love and Success.
3357986	3362188	SimCity DS 2 also comes out from EA on the Nintendo DS.
3362429	3364170	And quickly glancing at the PSP,
3364997	3367959	To see if there's anything of note for you guys in Japan on there.
3368780	3370341	Biohazard Trilogy Box.
3370821	3371602	But that's the movies.
3371822	3372643	Sorry, not the games.
3373563	3376245	But if you want that on your PSP, you can check that out.
3376566	3378927	Also, a port of Need for Speed Pro Street.
3379328	3386333	And since Skype was recently released in Japan, I believe we covered that on last week's news, the PSP microphone is finally hitting the shelves this week in Japan.
3386953	3387454	So check it out.
3387854	3390036	I want Kunio-kun Dodgeball.
3390296	3393058	Well, you can import it from one of your favorite import retailers.
3393098	3394299	Or if you wait a few months...
3394975	3396076	I have some releases for you guys On the 20th
3421598	3433870	CSI Crime Scene Investigation Hard Evidence on Wii Mystery Dungeon Sharon the Wanderer on DS Ratchet and Clank Size Matters Sega Superstars Tennis on a bunch of stuff
3434889	3445840	Spinout, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Victorious Boxers Challenge, and then we've got some games on the 21st.
3446841	3457232	That would be Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fate, we have Offroad for PS2, PC, and PSP, Samurai Warriors 2, Extreme Legends, and that's it.
3458342	3464104	Very surprised no one mentioned Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fate in their gaming weeks because I heard the game came out.
3464464	3467045	Some of my friends picked it up and have been raving about it.
3467285	3468526	I didn't like Crystal Chronicles.
3468846	3474588	I didn't either, but the DS version doesn't look quite like the GameCube one, so it might be worth a look.
3474628	3475028	I don't know.
3475828	3476428	I'm just curious.
3476448	3477128	How about Chatters?
3477229	3478469	Chatters, any of our Chatters pick it up?
3479209	3480410	Post your reviews real quickly.
3480430	3481470	I'll read some of them in a minute.
3482813	3485874	In the US, we're getting a few things that are pretty interesting.
3486615	3492297	This week, of course, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3493118	3495839	Sega Superstars Tennis coming out on almost everything.
3495919	3500041	PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and the DS.
3500661	3504703	The Metal Gear Solid Essentials Collection is coming out on PlayStation 2.
3504983	3510426	If you want to relive some of those older Metal Gear games before number 4 comes out.
3511481	3515586	Condemned 2 Bloodshot on PlayStation 3, apparently a week late.
3517048	3519530	Hot Shots Golf Out of Bounds on PlayStation 3.
3520812	3523295	Lost in Blue 3 on the DS.
3524236	3528100	I'm still shocked that they actually got a third game in that series.
3528120	3530162	I wouldn't be surprised if we see a fourth one either.
3530463	3531644	They're whoring that thing to death.
3532929	3536670	SingStar 90s Edition is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.
3537730	3544272	Samurai Warriors 2 Extreme Legends on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 via download.
3545492	3546752	Some other fun stuff.
3547273	3549893	Worms of Space Oddity on the Wii.
3551013	3553014	Fantasy Aquarium on the DS.
3554894	3557635	Go Pets Vacation Island on the DS.
3558325	3560686	Which looks really weird and kind of stupid looking.
3561307	3563668	Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on the Wii.
3563908	3565149	That one also is a week late.
3566230	3569552	George of the Jungle on PlayStation 2 Wii and the DS.
3571232	3572753	And let's see here.
3576556	3580578	The PlayStation 3 version of Karaoke Revolution American Idol is finally coming out.
3580778	3583480	That totally delayed for about a month now.
3584900	3587482	And let's see.
3588919	3610404	I believe that's it next week though the week after next I should say and I can't wait for this Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 for PSP alright well moving on talking about something recently hitting the US DDR you remember DDR?
3610444	3613044	our whole show used to be our whole show used to be about DDR
3617450	3618211	and stuff.
3618431	3619853	And DDR is still going.
3620393	3623637	DDR, obviously, you know, we get phone calls from folks on Skype once in a while.
3623657	3625339	Why don't you love Bomani like you used to?
3625860	3627502	Then we have to say, because it hasn't changed.
3628614	3631555	Well, anyhow, actually, DDR is changing a little bit.
3632315	3634276	E-Amusement, you've heard of this before, right?
3634356	3637217	E-Amusement is a system they have in Japan, where you basically have these little cards.
3637757	3640678	Picture, y'all know, if you've been to the arcades, y'all know Initial D, right?
3640698	3641298	How you have the cards.
3641598	3650781	Picture something like that, but on a DDR machine, where you can kind of save your high scores, but it's also hooked into the internet, and so you can have these global leaderboards and all this stuff.
3650981	3651461	Well, guess what?
3651481	3655122	The E-Amusement system, finally, after all these years, is hitting America.
3656108	3664134	And this is coming from an official Konami website, ddronlinecommunity.com is their website, and it's got the Konami logos and all that fun stuff.
3665174	3670718	They are announcing that Naperville, Illinois, of all places, because when I think of arcade gaming, I think of Naperville, Illinois.
3671299	3672960	But this must be one hella good arcade.
3673200	3675802	Brunswick Zone is the arcade that's going to be getting the EMU system.
3676122	3680585	And come to think of it, this is an arcade that usually does a lot of the beta tests for DDR, so I'm not surprised.
3681065	3682266	It's just kind of funny that, you know,
3683737	3685398	Ground Zero for TDR Evolution.
3685458	3690920	I'm not sure because I don't know too much about Benson, but maybe it's close to one of Benson's distribution centers or something like that.
3691160	3691400	Maybe.
3691540	3691820	I don't know.
3691860	3692421	I'm just guessing.
3692721	3694862	Brunswick makes me think of bowling.
3695622	3695822	Hmm.
3696556	3698437	I know, I think Brunswick did make bowling stuff.
3698557	3699438	They made bowling pins.
3699458	3702019	They might do entertainment stuff, you know, in other places.
3702420	3708783	But anyhow, and as Konami says on the site, it's the new online service which connects arcade locations in North America via the internet.
3709124	3713706	Arcade players can compete with each other, review their ranking, tournament results, save the play data, and more.
3714067	3718509	Konami will expand this new level service nationwide with Brunswick Bowling and Billiards.
3719130	3720671	So coming to a bowling alley near you.
3721651	3722171	There you have it.
3722732	3726294	Now my question is, is this enough to make you interested in DDR again?
3727938	3728298	Maybe.
3729078	3730839	I say not really.
3731119	3734261	I kind of miss the old internet ranking that we had back in the day.
3734341	3735481	Oh yeah, that was old school.
3735501	3754929	But yeah, I mean, besides the fact that I do miss DDR a little bit for the nostalgia value, here's the reason why I don't think this is exactly the kick in the butt in the community that DDR's kind of needed for about, oh, four years now, is that the internet's already been doing this long before Konami decided to officially endorse it.
3755427	3759352	This has been going on since like 4th Mix.
3759392	3761335	What are those tracking sites for DDR?
3761375	3762537	I mean, they've come and gone.
3762597	3764059	That's how long those things have been around.
3764079	3772951	Well, didn't a long time ago, and it was built in the 4th Mix, they had a code that you could write down that you could go onto the website and plug it in, and there's your internet rankings.
3773447	3774108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3794173	3796836	And then somebody could challenge you if they thought you were lying about your score.
3796916	3797736	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3797877	3798617	I think it's cool.
3800059	3801780	GS68 says VJ Army.
3801860	3803282	Yeah, like that, but DDR.
3803382	3804683	There was one for DDR they had.
3805163	3807366	Here's what they need to do, and this would be pretty cool.
3808847	3812731	I don't know, you could have certain teams or whatever that you...
3814247	3831933	I guess associate yourself with I don't know how many different colors or whatever and then you could say like you play different arcades around the country or the world or whatever and you kind of capture them and they become like blue or whatever or red or whatever your color is and then kind of like remember how they had with Soul Calibur?
3832073	3833054	I think it was Soul Calibur.
3833074	3834314	Oh yeah, that was fun.
3834894	3838195	Now here's the thing, you're talking about making DDR a more competitive game, right?
3838676	3842217	That's what I've been saying for five years on this program that DDR's needed to do.
3843965	3846186	There is innovation sitting in there in the game.
3846226	3848926	Just make DDR more competitive as opposed to cooperative game.
3848966	3854568	You could make a whole new game out of it and really kick some butt in the franchise, but nobody's listening.
3855528	3862930	What they need to do, and I'm not sure who's in charge of the DDR games, is they need to get someone new in charge of the DDR games.
3863030	3866771	DDR Recall, says Actdeft, was the name of what I was trying to think of earlier.
3866831	3867251	Thank you.
3868712	3869092	There it is.
3872153	3875455	Anyhow, so those of you that are still playing DDR, and I know we have a lot of DDR fans on the list.
3875495	3876555	I'm not trying to knock DDR.
3876575	3879657	I mean, obviously, it's still a great game because it keeps you physical and everything.
3879677	3883439	Hey, if I had the money and a room, I'd be buying a machine for my house.
3883759	3885460	Okay, so whatever.
3885540	3887601	I'd still be playing it.
3887641	3890502	It just frustrates me that they won't innovate the damn game.
3890722	3892783	I just don't have time to make it down to arcades anymore.
3893324	3894504	I'll say it one more time.
3895285	3899987	If anybody happens to be listening, and I know we have folks on the inside that listen to this show once in a great while.
3901107	3905309	Nuke your code, build something from the ground up, innovate in the process.
3906349	3907450	Watch money flow in.
3907870	3913852	And stop, for the love of God, I know that you like doing these other modes like the fitness mode and that kind of shit.
3914352	3916413	You don't need to go that crazy with this stuff.
3916513	3920955	I mean, I think they've made it too user-friendly, too simple, you know what I mean?
3922095	3924977	I don't think you need a training mode in every single DDR game.
3925057	3928178	Because I know I didn't need a training mode to play the damn game.
3928438	3930819	I learned just fine by playing the damn game.
3932657	3933297	Let's move on.
3934958	3935338	Can we?
3936018	3936238	Yes.
3937178	3942859	Well, there is more news out there that will make iPhone owners happy, including myself.
3944600	3950341	There are going to be some game releases, including Pac-Man and Galaga.
3951121	3952322	And that makes me very happy.
3952542	3954822	Also... Sorry, go ahead.
3955702	3956643	Also bejeweled.
3957623	3958443	So I guess it's...
3959908	3962411	and Zuma and Peggle, which I don't really give a crap about.
3962491	3964052	I just care about Pac-Man and Galaga.
3964172	3966094	Peggle is really awesome, actually.
3966934	3967235	Is it?
3967455	3967695	Yes.
3969056	3969697	Oh, thank God!
3969717	3970918	I can play Pac-Man!
3973120	3974521	I wonder if you play with your finger.
3975041	3977544	Can't you play pretty much all these games on the iPod anyway?
3978324	3979085	Including Peggle?
3980126	3981407	Which is actually one of the better systems.
3981667	3983128	I think the iPod was made for Peggle.
3983168	3983609	It's awesome.
3983749	3984790	From what I hear, it sucks.
3984810	3987192	Like, Bejeweled, you have to kind of cycle through all the, like,
3987828	3991530	Gems and stuff using the little, whatever the fuck they call that thing.
3991890	3992611	Touch wheel.
3992931	3994031	Touch wheel.
3994171	3994492	I think.
3994532	3995412	Gay wheel, whatever.
3996192	3997733	The whole screen is touch screen.
3998474	4000014	It's just, I don't know.
4000235	4003997	I think you should just be able to poke whichever one and then poke the one next to it.
4004117	4005237	I think Bejeweled would be good on it.
4005437	4007118	I think that would work pretty well.
4007258	4009319	I'm surprised they haven't put Bejeweled on the DS yet.
4009499	4010340	I mean, they really...
4011505	4014107	Fuck, put a PopCap collection on the DS.
4014327	4015587	Watch how much that sells.
4015627	4017729	You know what else would work out?
4017769	4020190	You know what other games would work really well on the iPhone?
4021431	4022171	New things.
4023032	4024172	New games.
4025233	4026814	Things that haven't been thought of yet.
4027835	4028475	New stuff.
4029508	4031209	We have this game that we would like to pitch.
4031249	4032350	It's called Pen and Paper.
4032851	4038856	You can use the iPhone as paper and you can write stuff with your stylus, which is the pen.
4039316	4040237	Yes, and here's one.
4040877	4045841	It's based off a popular Saturday Night Live sketch and you have cats and they have lasers attached to their heads.
4046222	4049725	And where you touch on the screen, you shoot lasers at dogs and people.
4051366	4053788	And sometimes other laser cats in multiplayer mode.
4054181	4055981	I just had a random thought pop into my head.
4056181	4056522	What's that?
4056542	4060802	I actually had a different video game experience this week, but that was watching the Family Guy Star Wars special.
4063203	4064663	Did it feel like a game or something?
4064943	4068124	No, they were going into an asteroid field and it was asteroids.
4069044	4069284	Nice.
4071225	4071505	Anyway.
4073885	4080407	So, apparently the Chinese Olympics website has been accused of game piracy.
4081367	4081447	Um,
4082051	4091217	Apparently they have been stealing some Flash games that they feature on the website and kind of changing them just a little bit, but they're still blatantly stealing them.
4093059	4109350	According to the creator of these Flash games, Kaden Batrick, who noticed some very similar similarities with different games like FUA Fights, The Olympic Clouds, which is very similar to his Snow Day game that he has.
4109530	4110691	Also, there are some other ones.
4111745	4112766	that were also very similar.
4113446	4128493	Of course, you know, these have been removed from the Olympic sites as of last Monday, but there's still a couple games that are on there that may be stolen from some other websites as well.
4128633	4136237	So, you know, as if we didn't need more reasons to say the Olympics suck.
4136883	4138303	Odd1 has an interesting comment in chat.
4138323	4142385	It says, wait, aren't most Flash games rip-offs of each other or classic games?
4142525	4145886	Seriously, the Flash arena is rife with IP theft and copying.
4146046	4149327	True, they are, but this I think was blatant.
4149507	4154028	I mean, just like, if you made a Super Mario Bros.
4154068	4162471	game, but instead you changed it to, I don't know, a female chicken or something like that, that would be a blatant rip-off of Mario Bros.
4163611	4166652	And I don't know, you called it like Chick Sisters or something like that.
4167113	4168114	Wasn't that the PETA game?
4168394	4169315	Oh, yes, that was.
4169355	4170096	That's right.
4170136	4171117	Yeah, blatant ripoff.
4171297	4174059	Not really, though, because the level design was totally different.
4174079	4175000	Yeah, it was crap.
4175120	4176521	I get what you're saying.
4176581	4177642	Made me hungry for chicken, though.
4181105	4181466	All right.
4181726	4185709	And really, who goes to the Chinese Olympics website to play Flash games?
4185769	4188111	I mean, are people that bored?
4188452	4189172	I don't think so.
4190473	4191094	Good question.
4192936	4193216	Well...
4193948	4199791	We're just about done with part A tonight, but first off we have to read about our stupid person of the week.
4200172	4203313	And actually, I don't know, this isn't so much stupid as it's just kind of sad.
4203774	4207636	I don't really know how else to say it, so let's cue some music to read this very sad story.
4213599	4221404	A 15-year-old boy in the Austin area of Austin, Texas got killed, gunshot wound to the head.
4223594	4227397	The boy was playing a video game and his friend just shot him in the head.
4227417	4228838	13-year-old shooter.
4230700	4236024	13 years old shoots his 15-year-old friend in the head over a video game, I suppose, is what the story is trying to say.
4236404	4238686	Because they do make a mention at the very end of this story.
4239567	4240968	The boys were playing a video game.
4242068	4243189	The game was called God of War.
4243670	4246272	Oh yes, because there's tons of gun violence in God of War.
4250575	4252917	Thank you so much to these kids.
4254127	4255989	for giving Gamers Everywhere a wonderful name.
4256769	4257610	Where were the parents?
4258711	4259051	Where?
4260772	4262233	Out buying more ammo, of course.
4264495	4269339	Okay, I don't see how... There's no way they're going to be able to tie that to the game because there's no fucking guns in God of War.
4270460	4270740	At all.
4271521	4271901	Zero.
4275344	4276024	It just sucks.
4277085	4278847	I mean, it's not funny.
4278987	4279567	It's sad.
4279727	4281609	It's just kids shooting each other.
4282270	4283070	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4309434	4310655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4335111	4335932	and Last Blade II.
4351552	4366077	I'm not really exactly when the exact time frame is in Japan, because there's references to the Shinsengumi, to fighting for the Shogun, so I would assume it's right.
4366557	4370958	And from what I can tell from the characters in the game, it's sort of right around that transitional period.
4371719	4374840	But it's really just, you've got people who use different weapons.
4376480	4377901	One of the guys who worked on...
4380925	4383748	Guilty Gear actually helped develop this game, too.
4384709	4387332	And it's really, really good.
4387372	4392097	You've also got your choice of using power or speed.
4392637	4394319	So you can have a stronger, slower character.
4394359	4396321	You can have someone who's weaker but faster.
4397342	4401447	And of course, you've got your attacks and combos that incorporate all of that.
4402268	4402328	Um...
4404304	4407148	I just really think that it's a very nice game.
4407228	4418445	And one of the other things that it brought into it was a deflect where you could block a move and then you would be able to instantly attack.
4419756	4423399	So I thought that was a pretty neat function as well.
4424300	4430466	Also, Last Blade was the first SNK game to bring in super cancels into its gameplay.
4431427	4436171	And you've got desperation moves, super moves, all kinds of stuff.
4436231	4438593	It's just really, really a fun game.
4438873	4439954	The series is fun.
4440955	4443618	And the thing I like about the music is...
4445302	4447404	Pretty, I guess, almost on the classical end.
4447524	4460236	And one of the things I really liked about it, and this is going to sound kind of cheeseball, is that when you go into each stage, you sort of have a little cutscene in the top corner that sets up the area you're playing in.
4461558	4467904	And I think it's really cool, not just for the story, the characters themselves, but the environments in the game.
4469400	4471802	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4495067	4502170	I was going to say there was... I'm trying to remember the character that I played the most because I played the one who dressed up as her brother.
4504711	4506531	And I don't remember the character.
4506551	4507572	You played a cross-dresser?
4507912	4508392	Yes, I did.
4509232	4516335	I was going to say there was another game that's out there that sold one point... It was Kojiro, sorry.
4516355	4517035	0.18 million now for Eye of Judgment.
4524130	4524771	Never gonna happen.
4525531	4526332	Never gonna happen.
4529074	4530275	Alright, well there you have it.
4530775	4533397	Tonight's classic game of the week, The Last Blade.
4534098	4535139	Just the whole damn series.
4535879	4536620	On every platform.
4536660	4538661	Neo Geo, Dreamcast, there's one on Dreamcast, right?
4538681	4539342	There's Dreamcast.
4539402	4541824	I believe that there were PS2 versions.
4542664	4546868	I do want to say that there were, but of course the Dreamcast one was like, beautiful.
4547588	4551331	Alright, so we'll say the Dreamcast version then, because you're such a Dreamcast fan.
