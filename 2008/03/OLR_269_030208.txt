Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura
Hi
How are you Miss DarkSakura?
I'm well
You're well, that's good
Yes, I'm well
You're well, alright
I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well
I'll explain why momentarily
Okay
But first I have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki
Hello
How are you doing, Loki?
Good
Alright
Sorry I don't have anything extra for you tonight, but you know, that's what happens
I gotta say though, very interesting troubleshooting before the show
We were kind of joking last week on the show that February is the month of Broken here on Orange Lounge Radio
And unfortunately it looked like March was going to turn out the same way
Because for whatever reason we have a wireless network that sits inside the house here where we tape
And for whatever reason just last week when we were doing the short show
It suddenly decided that the strength is not going to be as powerful anymore
And the Justin TV cam would not see, that runs off an iBook that would no longer see the WiFi network
And then tonight Jamie's computer decided it wasn't going to see the network either
So I have no idea what's going on with the box
But very impressed with the technical skills behind
What did we do? We turned your computer
We turned my computer into a gateway
So it's using my wireless internet connection
But I have an ethernet cable and you ran it to the old router
And then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that
So it's bouncing wireless to the router to my laptop, wireless to the other router
So right now
We'll do a piggybacking
Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam which is back this week
Hi guys
Is going through this router
That goes through Loki's computer
That goes through the router in the house which goes to Comcast
And the internet
Yeah
Amazing
This is uber geek tech talk here on Orange Lounge Radio
It's like a wireless orgy
Alright
And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute
Because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program
I have something for Jamie
And it's actually her birthday present
And it's like six weeks early
What?
Yes I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early
Because it's something you have to prepare for
Okay
So I'm going to give this to you
Plus I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week
So I think this is a good time for me to give this to you
Okay
So here you go
Open it up and see what they're tickets to
Okay
Alright and hopefully she likes it, I hope
Wow I know they heard this squeak on Justin TV
Yay
Tell the listeners what I got you
Rob got me a ticket to see Margaret Cho
Now in here locally
Now I'd also like to point out, look at where the seats are
Eee
That's like close
That's third row
Probably look up her nose
Third row tickets
So quite excited
Yay
Oh my god where is this?
Davis
Really?
So it's not that far at all
Cool
There we have it
So mark that date on your calendar
It's May something something
I'm doing that right now
Alright
Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy
There you go
So I thought that would help after a poopy week
And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else
So like I knew I had to tell you
Or get tickets independently somehow
I didn't even know
I didn't either, I got an email about it
So there you go
And I know Jamie loves some Margaret Cho and I do too
She's pretty funny
Hopefully she's not quite so political
I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes
But you know
She's still somebody I like
Yes me and you
Cool
Alright
There should be two there
I was like
Okay
I thought so because I was like
Why
Okay
No you have to take me I'm sorry
Of course
Of course
No this is so cool
Thank you Rob
Alright you're welcome
Now we can get to talking about video games yes?
Yeah
Alright
So we're done with Tech Talk
We're done with Oprah
Now let's talk
Let's talk video games
How was your gaming week
Dark Sakura?
My gaming week was
Well it was interesting
Because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2
I picked it up
And then I had other stuff to do
Because I watched Tron earlier in the week
I was like
I love Tron I want to play Kingdom Hearts
Because of the whole Space Paranoids level
And there was a lot of burnout
And I watched Dan play a lot of burnout
And I played a lot of Ragnarok
That was it
Alright
Well Loki how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was okay
I played
I actually picked up Pop Tippon
And I've been playing quite a bit of that
In fact that's what I was playing before the show
It's fun
It's different
I like it
I don't know
It's very easy to play
But I guess
It takes some time to build up your armies and stuff
Then I played
And I actually purchased N Plus
On Xbox Live Arcade
And that game is just as fun as the original N
So thoroughly enjoying that
And
I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week
Because we were having this party
We have at the end of every month for our work
And this one happened to be leap year themed
And so they wanted Frogger
And they used my system to play Frogger
So I got to play some of that
Because no one else was touching it
And then
I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey
So that's actually pretty cool
I finally got to the point in the game
Where one of the characters dies
Not necessarily a main character
But I was just very surprised
On how everyone makes that argument
Of video games being art and stuff
Well
Shit I think there's a perfect example right there
Of how powerful they can make the story
And it was pretty cool
So
I'm about 11 hours into it now
Still on the first disc though
And just taking my time through that
And
Pretty much that's it I guess
Other than the usual Saints Row
But
No one wants to hear about that
For the five billionth time?
Yeah
Well let's see
In my gaming week I also played Lost Odyssey
And I had much the same experience as you did
I got to the second disc
Which means you kind of go through
Some big plot twists in the first event
Or first disc let's put it that way
And I'm amazed by the game
And I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flak
As it has been
Although you know I do understand
Some of the little complaints about the game
And even one of them I find to be kind of annoying
And that is lack of save points
One of the things that has been bugging me
Is that sometimes I'll be forced to sit there for an hour
While the next part of the game loads
Or whatever
I mean it just takes forever
It's crazy
To get to the next save point
While you watch through all these cut scenes
I mean it's not like it's bad
It's not like you're bored or anything
Or you're just getting antsy
Because there's lots to do
But sometimes I only want to play in little 30 minute chunks
And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour
It auto saves too for some things
Some things
There's checkpoints I guess
But not a lot
I haven't had that problem with save points
What do you think about the difficulty of the game?
It's not that difficult
Some of the boss battles were surprisingly tough
If you grind some of the way through there
Because a lot of this game seems like it's very quick
There's certain areas in the game
Where there's like two or three sections of the map
And then that's it
And then you're on to the next section of the world
Or whatever
It's very small
But
I don't know it wasn't that difficult
You just grind a little bit
And get your characters leveled up
And it's pretty easy
Also I have the preorder bonus
So I have an item that gives me
A level 2 guard or whatever
So I can block most of the shots
And it does zero damage to me
Nice I don't have that
That was something you got for preorder huh?
Hopefully they release that as a download thing later
It will probably come later on
Let's go over to the chatroom
The chatroom has their own comments
It only sucks when you die an hour without a save
Kind of true but there's also some things
Where you go through cutscene cutscene cutscene
And then you have to fight a big boss battle
I mean I know you can skip cutscenes
But even then sometimes you have to sit there
Because some of the cutscenes are rendered with the game engine
So you have to kind of sit there
And press A A A A A
You can also pause it
And hit the back button
For the cutscenes but what about the ones where they're actually talking to each other
With the dialogue boxes
You have to A A A
I don't know
It doesn't matter
It's honestly just a tiny little blemish
In what is otherwise a magnificent game
That deserves to be getting more attention than it is
As far as other games I've been playing this week
I'm playing Smash Brothers Brawl
Because I was
Loki was kind enough to loan me his Japanese copy
And the Wii to play it on
So I was checking that out a little bit this week
Didn't understand what I was doing but I was having fun
Playing just the massive
Free for all mode
So that was pretty cool
Obviously last week I was sick
On the show and I'm happy to report I'm better
I did have a sinus infection
So I had to go to a doctor and antibiotics and blah blah blah
He lent me that as kind of like a get better soon type thing
Which was very nice
He said I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time
I didn't actually hook that thing up till like Friday
That's exactly why I loaded tickets
This is exactly what I'm doing
I'm not playing Smash Brothers
Well I mean even before Smash Brothers Brawl
I never played Melee very much
Maybe once at a friend's house
The first Smash Brothers Brawl I didn't even touch
I don't know
It's not really my type of game
It's fun
But you know
I may pick up the US one
I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not
Gerardimo in chat says
Rob do you think Brawl lives up to the hype even if it's not in English?
Kind of
It's hard to tell
I don't feel right giving a fair review on a Japanese game
When I don't understand how to get into some of the modes
And look at the extra stuff
It does
Lowkey has no problem answering that
The parts I've seen so far
Like Smash Brothers Melee 1.5
A little bit
Because it's like the same kind of engine
The same stuff with just some new characters
But I realize that's not being totally fair
In saying that because I haven't looked at everything outside
Of just the brawling
But it does seem like there's a lot of the stuff they just copied
Right on over from the GameCube version
So very interesting
Frisbee says
Halo 3 feels like Halo 2.5
It's a little bit that
It's a little bit that
But that's what it is
So that was my gaming week
So if that's everybody's gaming week
Then we will move on to talking about some news
But for some housekeeping
Of which we have nothing special of note
What's that?
What's that?
The award contesting that's going on through all games
That's like three months old
I can't believe you just saw that
I did just see that
Hey I don't read
I unfortunately don't read their website
Or their forums
You're just too busy
Doing other things
I will give it a mention on air
I don't even know if it's still going on
I think it's kind of funny that Loki took so long to find it
I posted a link on the forums
Let me see
December 27th
I didn't even notice it
All games
Which our show runs on
We syndicate on their network
They play us Monday nights
And then Tuesday mornings
At 9am
No because they do their regular
All games show at 10 now
So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings
But I know our show is syndicated on their network
Mondays and Tuesdays supposedly
And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard
As a best affiliate podcast
And it's all going on in their forums
The voting
I would think it's already over
Three months ago
But then again the topics are still up
It's not closed
So who knows, maybe it's an ongoing thing
From yesterday to today
They've put the votes as anonymous
So you can't see
What each podcast has
Yesterday it didn't have it that way
And Tigerclaw says Sky they still haven't announced the winners
So I guess it is ongoing
For three months now
And Tigerclaw I know listens to all games
Like every other day
I don't know
I voted for us
Well I appreciate the support
I guess for yourself
I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby
But he bought a knife judgment
And I can't support that kind of behavior
That's most unfortunate
He also dropped out of the race
As of like yesterday
Didn't want to play that game huh
Alright well if you want to throw us a vote
It's over on forums.allgames.com
I will plug the other stuff I know we always got
We have our live general community at Orange Lounge
Our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio
And our Facebook is the O.L.R.
Be sure to look us up on our social networking sites
Meet other O.L.R. listeners
Look at our posts and clips of the show
We have on some of those places like MySpace
Tons of fun
Alright let's get into the gaming news. Loki take it away
Okay so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week
From Destination and Playstation
It's the retail only
Conference thing or whatever
I couldn't go but other people from my company did
Bastards
And of course
Some of the news that leaked out
Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date finally
It's officially coming to the U.S.
On June 12th
And that of course
Not only was leaked out but confirmed
By Konami
And they also said that if you reserve your copy
Of Metal Gear Solid 4 starting in April
2008
You get Metal Gear Saga 2.0
A DVD to catch you up on all the
Stuff that's going on in the series
As well as a
Data code for
Metal Gear Online
And then to coincide
With that and this
I don't know if this is going to be the official
You know remember because the 80 gig
Skew for the PS3 was being phased out
Well there's a new 80 gig Skew now
Same price but you get
Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3
Controller all for $4.99
Which is not a bad deal at all if you don't have
A PS3 because I know a lot of people
Would be buying a PS3 for that
And it's nice that they're actually throwing in
The DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that
Separately
No word on when that's coming out but it's
Supposed to come out around the same time as
Metal Gear Solid 4 obviously
So June 12th and on
I guess
Alright
Well moving on to
Other gaming news although it still
Has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4
Actually
Let me back up for just a minute
How important
Is this news to PlayStation
Fans you think?
I think it's very important
I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than
The year old MotorStorm
They needed to update that bundle
Anyways because
Shit that game is old now
And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game
To throw in there especially now that
I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with
The DualShock 3 controllers
Probably not the 40 gig for right now
Because there's supposedly
The one right now doesn't have it
And I don't know if they're going to announce a new one
Anytime soon
It's important
I think this game is actually one of the first
Major games for the PS3
That you can only get on the PS3
And you know that's
A little bit of fuel to Sony's Fire
Although this is the first of hopefully many
But
It hopefully does very well
Let's say
Metal Gear Solid 4 does not sell
All that I mean let's say
Obviously the game is going to sell fine
At least mediocre
But let's say the game does not sell super duper well
And doesn't move all these new bundles
Is that going to be really bad for Sony
Or will they get more chances?
They may have more chances but a lot of the stuff
That they're counting on is like way later on
Killzone 2 will be another one that moves systems
Resistance Fall of Man 2
Maybe MotorStorm 2
And then
Final Fantasy 13 that's so far off
That I wouldn't even
Consider that anything to wait for
Right now for the PS3
If you're going to wait that long you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4
But
At the same time
I don't know
It should do very well
But once again you know they're also hoping
Like Blu-Ray is going to sell these systems
You know it's a lot of hopes and dreams
But we'll actually have to see what happens
I mean it'll be a very interesting spring
My parents got a Blu-Ray player
Which kind of surprised me
Because they're not usually on the cutting edge
Of all the technological gadgets
And I was playing with their Blu-Ray player a little bit
And it was slow
It was so slow
And I'm sorry I know sometimes we get the mail
Like you guys only pick on Sony
We hate Sony
Because if we hated Sony we would so have a PSP oriented website
But anyway it's beside the point
But seriously it was slow and clunky
It reminded me
Yeah it's the first generation I kind of think
Okay well the first DVD player we ever had
Was kind of slow and clunky too
I remember when I had a single speed CD-ROM drive
Now that's slow shit right there
Well Rob you know what
What?
I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-Ray player
Why?
We got an HD DVD player
Did you? Did you get the one for the Xbox?
Yes we did, 50 bucks
Nice
Oh yeah because they're so cheap now
Well the only movie I really want on it is Stardust
So I don't care what else Dan gets
You picked up a couple of movies
But I don't really care because that's all I'm getting
There you go
Nice
Alright well obviously Metal Gear Solid is one thing many PlayStation 3 fans are looking forward to
But there's also Metal Gear Online
And we already talked about
In a previous show the Metal Gear Online
Starter Pack that's supposed to be going out
With Metal Gear Solid 4
Well they're going to be beta testing Metal Gear Online
In late April
But here's the deal
If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4
You will get guaranteed access
Quote unquote to this limited beta
It's a little bit reminiscent
It seems to me like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing
I think
There you go
But I'm sure most people that would be into Metal Gear Online
Are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4
This is just incentive I guess to get pre-orders out there
Which makes sense to me
That Sony would want that
Because they're going to want strong numbers out the gate
It's impossible to try and put next to
Halo 3
And what I'm assuming
Will probably be Smash Brothers numbers
And so on and so on
It's kind of like their day one big seller
It's going to be the number one game for the console
It's just
Halo 3 may have
Been the number one game
For the Xbox 360
But I don't think it's sold that many systems
I mean I'm sure there's people that waited to buy a system
For Halo 3
I don't know
I don't believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game
Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems
But then again
Their system is still more expensive
And it's a little easier now
To make that purchase now that we know
That Blu-Ray is going to be the high def format
Of choice
And Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now
And we know when it's coming
And plus now you have
Grand Theft Auto 4 as well
There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there
But
They can't just rely on these
Couple games to push the sales
They really need to put out a strong library of games
And they have a lot of catching up to do
Alright well
For you Metal Gear Solid fans
You might want to go pre-order the game if you want to check out the
Online beta
If you don't already have it pre-ordered
Which I'm sure many of you do
Well
There had been talk that Metal Gear Solid
Was going to be ported to Playstation 2
That's actually not happening
It's just going
That the Metal Gear Solid
Essential Collection is going to be on
Two DVD's
It's supposed to be out on
March 18th for 29.99
Over here in the US
It's going to be a Playstation 1 game
That's awesome
Well I wouldn't see
There would be no point to really remake
Metal Gear Solid for Playstation 2
Maybe there were people that were hoping
Because there was the GameCube one
Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills
When it came out?
I think so
Maybe people were hoping some of those extra frills would come over
I'm surprised that they didn't put
Metal Gear Solid 1
And then also have VR missions
As well
Well my theory is that they are going to
This is again just my theory
Because really all
The VR missions was part of Metal Gear Solid Integral
Which was
Basically Metal Gear Solid done as a first person shooter
All you need to do is put in the camera control
And you can play it that way
So they could easily
Include the VR missions and the
I guess integral mode
Hmm
Well it's neat
I mean I guess it's not too
If this Playstation is backwards compatible
And all that at least what little
Backwards compatibility some of them have
It's not surprising that they only need to put it out there
On Playstation 1 format
Exactly and if I remember correctly
I believe this collection is coming out
In a couple weeks
Should be able to pick it up soon
And it's cheap 30 bucks
Very cool
A really cool
Well you know not cool for me because I already own
A couple PSPs but for someone that may not own
A PSP yet you can get a brand new PSP
Slim that happens to be red
With a giant head of Kratos
Silk screened on the back
This will actually be replacing
The Star Wars entertainment bundle
That they've had for a while
You can no longer get those unfortunately
And of course it will be coming out
I believe next week
With the brand new game
Of course God of War Chains of Olympus
And some other cool stuff that will come
With this entertainment pack
It will come with a copy of
The Superbad UMD
As well as a voucher to download
Syphon Filter Combat Ops
From the PC Playstation store
Now here's my only little problem
With this whole thing
Usually these entertainment packs come with
A 1 gigabyte memory stick
I have heard no mention of a 1 gigabyte memory stick
With this so
Yay I can download a game to nothing
You have to buy a memory stick separately
Way to go awesome
This might be a bad idea
But do you think we're just supposed to assume
It's there anyway?
I don't think it is because they would have mentioned it
It would have been a selling point
Hey surprise me
Maybe it is in there
I'm just going to take a while to guess
As they didn't mention it
And I don't think it was in the press release
Although I will double check in just a second here
I'm pretty sure it does not come with a memory stick
Which is kind of sad
Now Alpha Canagram in chat says
Loki bigger sizes are dirt cheap
1 gig is useless
That's fine okay
But the fact is it's still stupid to offer
A free downloadable game
A voucher or whatever
That's worth I guess 10 bucks
When you don't have anything to store it to
Well here's my thought
What about the fact that
My roommate was hooking up a new printer today
And it didn't come with a USB cable
To hook it up to the computer
So it's kind of that same logic to me
Batteries not included except now it's other things
Memory not included
I understand
Buying a game console back in the day
Didn't come with a memory card
To save your games and stuff
It's completely optional but
I mean come on
God of War, Chains of Olympus, Syphon Filter
You're going to need a memory stick
And it's just kind of annoying that you get it all home
Or something you get it for Easter or something like that
And it's like
Yeah I'm ready to play this game
Aw shit I gotta go drive back down to the store
To pick up my memory stick
I don't know I think it's still kind of cheap
But whatever
I mean if that's kind of your thing
Then go ahead and purchase it
And it'll probably be limited
Since the last one was too
Although I think
Most people that are all crazy about God of War
Most of them probably already have a PSP don't you think?
That's always what amazes me about these
Bundles that come out so much later
But oh yeah this is also coming out
In June-ish I mean that around
That time frame so it's going to be three months after
The game actually comes out
I don't know it's cool I guess if you don't
Have one yet I mean maybe
You might think about picking this up
But to be honest the only reason I picked up
My Daxter bundle was because it was the only thing
Available at the time so
It wasn't like I really wanted to play Daxter
Another comment from chat
From ake ripper I think that is
A K E ripper
It's chat.orngelandstranger.com says
Still one gigabyte you don't get far
You know what
I'm using my 16 memory
16 megabyte memory stick
That came with my original PSP
32 or whatever it is I'm using the old school original
One from the first PSP bundle
Hey you know what that's fine
That's the thing right now
Say you can't
Just throw in a 32 meg one
Yeah I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later
But hey you know what at least it will get you through
Being able to save your game
Of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box
And I'm sure since those
One gigabyte memory sticks are what 30 bucks
Now the 32 megabyte one should be like 50 cents
If that
Come on they've got to be sitting on a bunch of them
Just dump that shit
Hey I'm not alone
We have another chatter in chat and I cannot pronounce this name
For the life of me it's
TVVICHMAN
I don't know
Says I still use my 32 so I'm not alone
So there you have it
Well you know a lot of people
Very excited about home
Even though it keeps kind of getting pushed back
And pushed back but you know what they say
As long as there's reason and purpose
Behind pushing it back then sometimes
It isn't all necessarily a bad thing
Apparently
Some big Sony games are going to be integrated
Into home and those games are Warhawk
Uncharted, Drakes, Fortune and Resistance
Fall of Man and assumably these are just
Three to start and you know obviously more would follow
I imagine you know big
Other big titles even from third party publishers
Would be included here too
Warhawk is going to let eight people
Meet in like a war room area
Prior to a match and you can make out
Your strategies on a sand table
That's like a replica of the different levels
In the game and then you go right from there
Into your match so
Kind of cute and then Resistance and
Uncharted basically your avatars
Can go into levels from those
Games and that would allow you
To get to parts of the game that are even completely
Unseen now in addition to that
Uncharted is supposed to have a 2D shooter game
That's built into it that launches from home
So that's some cool ideas
That sounds fairly
Generous and kind of neat
You know I imagine the shooter
Is cheesy but it's better
Than nothing and it's probably kind of one of those
Like cool little you know integrations
The news about
Home is very exciting and it makes
Me wish it would have been out a lot sooner but
You know okay if the delays are making it better
Then it's hard to complain right? It's all part of their plan
To hopefully get more momentum I mean and this is
Also stuff that they can say look here
Live does not have this
This is why you should buy a PS3
They're giving us reasons now why you should
Own a system which is what they should have been
Doing since the beginning
Frisbee in chat says push it back
Until no one cares am I right?
I don't know but the more they drop little tidbits
Like this it's hard to ignore
Yeah but at the same time though it's like
You know Duke Nukem Forever
Come on dude I would like to see a little
More video of this stuff
In action not just screenshots I mean
You know just because that really
Video helps you get so much more of a sense
Of what it really looks like than pictures
The trophy room thing
It's kind of neat I guess but at the same time
I'm just like whatever
Like I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room
And see a stupid dragon from Lair
I'd be like wow
Testament that you played Lair
Man you suck
Well you know what though Xbox is the same thing with the achievements
You know you get certain achievements
Well it's like I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room of like
Achievements that they've earned during like you know
Totem Ball or some shit
You played the game for ten hours or something
Wow you have dedication
You pressed start
Achievement unlocked wasn't that one in the Simpsons game
Madden or
Simpsons maybe or Avatar
You hit something eight times in a row
1000 points unlocked
I don't know Jamie are you excited about
Home on Playstation 3
Relatively
I'm excited because it's free if I had to pay for that shit
I'm not playing in home
Free is a good thing
Then again Yaris was free
Oh that is a good point
Touche from Jamie
Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record
Well there actually
Is a date now for that
Dual Shock 3
Over here in the US we're getting it on April 15th
For $54.99
And I don't want that for my birthday
So nobody get it for me
But it's
I mean it's basically
From what I can tell in here
The 6 axis with vibration
So
So basically it's the controller that should have come out
The first time it's finally coming out
Yeah except for all the crappy legal
Problems they were having
What was the price again on that
That's a $54.99
$54 bucks for a freaking controller
But then again Xbox is just as bad right
Isn't it like $59 for their wireless
It's the same price as their current controllers
He rumbles $5 extra
I guess
That is too damn much for a controller
Wait no I actually rumble
Well tilt sensors in rumble are $5 extra
Well it is also wireless
But still
Yeah the wireless controller
I don't know
I don't give Xbox a pass here either
I think their controllers are way too expensive too
And then the Wii one is just as bad too
The controllers are way too damn much money
I have to say something though for the Xbox 360
Controllers that the keyboard attachment is cool
Really?
I haven't even really played with one ever
The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the
Remote nunchuck because the remote is $40
And the nunchuck is $20
So it's $60 all together
I don't know I guess maybe for some reason
I let Nintendo slip by a little more
And I know people want to call it fanboyism
But I don't here's my logic
I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price
Because that controller is
Really kind of like the core of the system
And the motion and everything
But I don't know I guess one could argue that
It's the same thing on the Playstation 3
I don't know what the motion should on the Playstation 3
Is very like kind of
Last minute?
Not really last minute
But just kind of useless I think
I like this comment from Alpha Canagram in chat
He says Skye wait
Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube
Was most expensive
That's true because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance
If you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles
You had to get four of those
You know we actually still kept our Game Boy Advance for that reason
So that we could play Pac-Man vs.
I was going to say I can only think of like
Three games that even use that feature
Not four because there's Animal Crossing was one
And yeah Animal Crossing
Pac-Man vs. Crystal Chronicles
And Zelda for sorts
And that's really it just a handful of games
But Pac-Man vs. is awesome
And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii
You start to see more of that stuff too
Didn't Pac-Man vs. come out on the Namco Museum DS?
Yes that's right
It's pretty cool
It is pretty cool
Not enough to get me to buy Namco games all over again
Those classic collections that keep re-releasing
Random thoughts
Speaking of classic collections
It just kind of made me go huh
I was randomly at a record store earlier this week
Because I was gasping shock and awe
Buying a CD I know I know
I was actually buying a CD
And this place sells video games as well
They sell used video games
And I actually saw on the play
And I was actually looking at like old Genesis
And Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything
Like really like cool in the retro stuff
It was all sports
It was all sports stuff like Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL
So that's pretty much all they had
But one thing I noticed on the Playstation 2
Is an Activision anthology
And I never even knew this game existed
Because the Activision releases an anthology
On every system
You know they had one on Playstation 1
They've had one on the PC
I actually own the one on PC
They've had a ton of them
I didn't realize they had one on Playstation 2
But I just thought it was funny
Because I'm reading the back of the box
Like all the games that are in it
And like this is how they're selling the game
Is that A it talks about you can do cool effects
To the games while you're playing
Like you can play Pitfall
It's even an Activision compilation
Pitfall 2 and some of these other
Like really obscure Activision games
Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure
The other ones that were listed were very obscure
Like Bridge
What's that?
I think I'm going to order a freeloader
You're going to order the Activision one?
No a freeloader
Oh freeloader? Oh
We'll talk more about that a little later I bet
So another person jumping from the Sony ship
Would be Phil Harrison
He's actually resigned from
Sony Computer Entertainment
Which is sad because that only leaves
Kaz left and
Luckily though it's not
Was it not
Oh god
The crazy guy
Ken Kutaragi
Thank god he's not the only one left
Piloting this boat here
No that does leave Kaz
I believe there were some rumors on where
He was going to go
Between Atari
To I don't know why he would jump
From one ship to another sinking ship
But whatever
But sad to see him go because
He was actually kind of a voice of logic
I guess for the company
But who needs that?
Really
I don't know
But that is weird
If it's true he went to Atari
That's kind of like
I don't know but maybe he can help fix things there
That would be nice to see them turn around
Alright well
With all this talk about Lost Odyssey
And what a great RPG it is
Sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out
That were actually really amazing
One of them was Persona 3
And I admit I did not get to really play much of Persona 3
I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is
But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it
Because apparently
Persona FES which is an expansion
To Persona 3
Is coming out here in the US on April 22
And it will set you back $29.99
But the cool thing about it
Obviously this is a Playstation 2 game
It's not in the current gen of consoles
It's in Playstation 2
But obviously that's what a lot of people still have
But for such a low price
For such a huge game
You get both the enhanced version of Persona 3
And new bonus features
And a new chapter that is apparently 30 plus hours
So this is kind of like Oblivion game of the year edition
But for Persona
5 bucks which isn't bad
There's still pretty good stuff coming out in the Playstation 2
And luckily a lot of the people
That put out really crappy shovelware games
For the PS2
Have now moved to the Wii
So you get a pretty good crowd
Although there are still some
But luckily now they've adopted the price point at $14.99 retail
Which you can't beat that
Even if it does suck
Well you can download a lot of games
For five bucks
So I don't know $14.99 still feels too expensive
For me for a crap game
You know Hannah Montana goes to college
Or whatever the hell they put out
I don't know I pulled that name out of thin air
You want to know what status I think they would make that game?
They just might
Patent pending
She goes to college, she's rich
I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana
Even if I were really rich I would want to be fully educated
True
But then again if you're
I think in my mind it's the perfect
A puppet of Disney then
In my mind it's a sitcom
Just like Saved by the Bell went to college
At one point
I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney channel stars
Need to go to college at some point
That's their exciting surroundings
That would have saved Brittany from her fate
Perhaps
Goofy goes to college
Can I read the next story please?
You may
Well Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out
It says it will be out in time
For the winter holiday
To be
Politically correct
I'm so excited that they're releasing Game On Festivus
Decemberween
Gives you something to celebrate
So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?
It's island themed
Which is so, you know
Wintery
That might be kind of fun though
I did think the first one had too much dirt
This one seems to have plenty of dirt in it too
It's in the middle of a desert
I'm sorry
Too much dirt for you
Although, you know what
I really have to say that
The artist's joystick
Where we got this information from
Are very creative
I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon
Because I don't think they've done a
Good off-road moon racing game
Actually
There was Cruise in the World
Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX
Cruise in the World had you go play on the moon
And then you ran into aliens
That had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub
Thank you
Malholus in chat
I hope I'm pronouncing that right
We have a lot of new chatters tonight
Malholus in chat says
Moon Patrol
Damn straight
That's all the moon game you need
Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?
I was just thinking
There's all these bastardized Atari games
From years past
Why didn't they ever put out a bastardized Moon Patrol?
That's what I'm curious about
What picture am I looking for?
The screen capture
They took a picture from Motorstorm and put
Microsoft Paint
I have to show this in the chatroom because it's hilarious
Oh, I just thought of it
Hannah Montana
Goes to her first frat party
Hannah Montana
goes wild
Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs
Hannah Montana gets a podcast
They already do crap like that
It's called the evening news
There you go, Malholus again
Hannah Montana goes to the moon
There it is, right there, two things we need
Alright, enough of this
I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana
We do not need more Hannah Montana
We need less Hannah Montana
What we do need more of
Is more colors in PS3
And there is a rumor
I was just thinking that
I know, I wasn't
I can read minds
It's a
It's a skill I learned
So
There is a new SKU coming out for the
48 PS3, I know this for a fact
Because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3
The Blu-Ray
Because Sony thinks, you know what
Blu-Ray is the winning format
We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3
You will just buy your own fucking
Blu-Ray movies
So there is going to be a new SKU coming out
And apparently
Some Circuit City employees
Have begun receiving their shipments
Of these new PS3s
And on the shipping box there is a model number
Which is CECHH01
And for those who may remember
A while back when we covered that the FCC
Had a
Item filed from
Sony regarding a white PS3
While the item numbers
Happened to match
So is it going to be the white system
Coming out to
Replace the black one with the
Spider-Man 3?
Maybe? I don't know
We'll have to see I guess
But if that's the case
It's going to be coming soon
Are there really people that are like
I mean do these people really really exist
That are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3
Until they release them in white
Or until they release them in red
Or what are the colors that we talked about
The silver thing that we talked about
On another show in another country
Are there really those people
I don't think that there are
People maybe with the DS because it's cheaper
But I don't think color is really going to
I don't know
Sway you on buying the system or not
People aren't going to go
It's $400
If only it were in white
I would really just make the purchase
I just need something that matches the drapes
And black doesn't do it for me
I fucking hate when they come out with new system colors
Because then they have to come out with new accessory colors
And new everything colors
And it just sucks
Lots of comments in chat
Brad from PodCulture says
I waited until Blue to get my DS
With Nintendo though it's inevitable
That they're going to come out in other colors
That is still a little crazy
Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing
But you'll notice whatever happened to the pink Wii
Whatever happened to that
They didn't need to do it, that's what I guess
SSJ100Matt says
Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3
Damn right, I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3
That would be the best
chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you'd like to join in
We do try to keep an eye on JustinTV's chat room as well
But sometimes I have a hard time staying on top of that
Because that's two different chat rooms
That's a lot
Something you're going to be able to play on those
White PlayStations
Would be lots and lots of games coming to the PlayStations store
25 old school titles have been leaked
By the European version of the PlayStations store
Well also
There are some pretty cool titles in there
No, there are some very cool titles in there
That's what makes me think it's probably fake
It's not fake, these are from the European version of the ESRB
Is where they got these titles from
I thought it was the store delete
Well they're coming to the PlayStations store
The PEGI
I guess leaked this information
I thought it was Sony that accidentally somehow made these visible for a minute
Well then I guess it's legit
And there are some cool games coming out
Bust a Groove, Holla
Those folks that like their old school music games and stuff
Very excited to hear that
Crash Bandicoot 3
Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3
Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies
Everybody's Golf, Klona
Klonoa, sorry
Klonoa is like the best game ever
Kurushi Final, Motortune Grand Prix
Namco Museum 1, 2 and 4
I don't know what happened to 3
Omega Boost, Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4
Rollcage, Spyro
Tekken 2, 3
Twisted Metal, Vib Ribbon
Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097
Vib Ribbon
That's pretty awesome
That game is crack
And actually I don't know if a lot of people remember
Colony Wars is actually pretty decent as far as the space shooter goes
Same with Cool Borders, that was pretty fun
Omega Boost was awesome
Son of Dad says Intelligent Cube please
There you go
He said don't they have the PSP one?
Didn't they come out with like a sequel-ish thing to that game?
Yeah they have a couple of them
Let's see, Crunky Boy Jr. in chat says
I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared it right up
Hey, Klonoa was a great game
But it was messed up at the end
I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you
Nice
So in other bundle-y news
In Europe they're going to get a
Pretty decent bundle I'm going to say
That is the
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle
And it's a 40GB PS3
I'm sorry, my apologies
80GB
Oh sorry, they're doing two of them
My apologies
I was just staring at the red box
Because it's, well
Kind of red and black and very cool colored
And it's got a silver car up on the front of it
I can't see what it is though
But they are saying that
It's going to be
Out on a
It's going to be
Out on a
It's going to be out on a
It's going to be out on a
It's going to be out on a
Looks like a
March 29th
And retails for
$3.99 Euro
So that's pretty cool
I love all this hubble-oo over
Prologue, it's not even the actual game
It's just prologue
You know to be honest I think this game
Is going to hurt their sales for the full game
You think? A lot of people like
If I were to, if I had to buy
A Gran Turismo game I don't think I'd buy the full one
Because I don't race 200 cars
You know there's only a few cars
That actually probably race
And you know after I play this game
You know prologue for however
Many months until the full game comes out
I'll probably be sick of it
And just be like okay whatever I'm done
I'm not going to spend another $50 or whatever
To upgrade to have
More cars
Now the smart thing to do
Would be to release the retail version
Of Gran Turismo 5
And release a $20 update
That would give you all the additional cars
And tracks
That would never happen though
RossdielUT in chat says
Loki Gran Turismo isn't for you it's for crazed car freaks
There's another bundle listed on here too
What's that?
A blu-ray bundle
The 40GB PS3
With Spiderman 300 and Casino Royale
On March 19th
Now that's reasonable
That Blu-ray has officially won or whatever
That's you know totally understandable
There's a lot of people that are going to buy
PlayStation 3 just because it plays Blu-rays and games
You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people
To do that because that's how PlayStation 2 won
Hey I bought my PlayStation 2
Well actually no I didn't buy it
As a DVD player I just bought it because
Armored Core was coming out on it
And I love me some Armored Core
Except I didn't buy Armored Core 4
Whatever
I liked what Akdeft in chat says too
Gran Turismo 5 prologue, Gran Turismo 5 introduction, Gran Turismo 5
And then Gran Turismo 5 epilogue
And yet no Gran Turismo portable for the PSP
It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series
It's like Final Fantasy 7 games now at some point
And they'll have Final Fantasy
You know prologue with cars
You know Gran Turismo
Gran Turismo with dress fears
There's different kinds of chocobos
Do you get to try out different chocobos?
Well you may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5
There are plenty of other games
To get your attention this week
Starting things off we have Bully Scholarship Edition
Coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360
Slightly better than I guess the PlayStation 2 version
Because it has slightly better graphics
And a few more missions
Great
The game I teased last week
Let's Ride Friends Forever
Coming out on the DS
Worst name ever
If you're into baseball
Or most unintentionally funny name ever
Depending on how you look at it
There's going to be two games for you
Sony's MLB 08 The Show
And that's coming on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PSP
And then MLB 2K8
Coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360
We have Army of Two coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
Chicken Hunter on the DS
It's a stupid game where you kill chickens
So it's not just a clever name
No, it's very literal
And imagine Figure Skater
It is a game where you are a figure skater
And you get to do little gay ass moves
Yay, Figure Skater
I'm almost offended by that comment
I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to Figure Skater
Yeah, exactly
Let's see what else we have here
Also, Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC
Awesome
Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week
God of War Chains of Olympus
Coming out on the PSP
That looks pretty awesome
Pets Bunnies for the DS
Yes, you too can raise bunnies now
Hooray
Let's see
Just a small little game called Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii
That will be coming out a week from today
Hooray
Ninja Reflex is coming out on the Wii and the DS this week
For your Ninja themed party games
World Championship Cards for the PSP
In case you want to play something other than poker
Mystery Dungeon Shiren the Wanderer coming out on the DS
Let's see
We've also got Spitfire Heroes Tales of the Royal Air Force
That's on DS as well
And Homies Rollers on the DS
You're like Homie the Clown
That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures
They can get out of those machines for 10 cents
Oh, my boss used to collect those
Let's see
I believe that's it
Smash Brothers Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week
I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance
But maybe there's a certain audience for that, I don't know
I will tell you what
Uh oh, what
If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies
Oh no, here we go, here we go
If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies, yes, what?
We'll do the whole Tingle thing and we'll burn Eye of Judgment
We'll need another game in there, just more of a chance
You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?
Yeah
Great
The makers of that game just thanked you for selling like, you know
About a hundred additional copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise
Here, I'll make it even more fair, the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever
Whoa, whoa, whoa
So the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment now
Yes
Because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell a hundred thousand copies
Somebody mark the date and time of this
Oh, it's almost exactly seven o'clock here on Sunday evening, March 2nd
It will never sell anything, okay, come on
Well that's something, that's giving the listeners
That's for the little meter some of the chatters made up
Some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that looks like a telethon thing
And it's like the road to one million copies
It'll never happen
Now it gives them something to add to that
It'll never ever happen
Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never ever sell
Here's the thing, chat room
You gotta get him, you keep adding games to it
Until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total
Oh yeah, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that
Gold Banjo says another one for the OLR wiki
I forgot to mention Housekeeping, this would have been good
They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio
And you can wiki stuff on it
Even though I guess, well we have an official Wikipedia article
But now we have our own freaking entire wiki
Which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really
You'd think I wrote it or Loki wrote that article
But we've never really worked on that
It was totally the fans that did that, so that was really cool
I haven't even seen it
On Wikipedia?
Oh, well I thought you meant, oh you meant on Wikipedia
Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia
A wiki set up for us
But now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki
That's what I was talking about
Yes, that, well I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out
It's orangeloungeradio.wikia
That's W-I-K-I-A dot com
So check it out, Orange Lounge Radio
And somebody just linked it in chat as well, so check that out
Alright, meanwhile, let's go back to traveling the globe
And looking at upcoming releases
And we'll start on the Xbox 360 in Japan
You get a new version of the console coming out
The Xbox 360 Arcade hits Japan
And with that comes some price reductions, yay
Including Riot Act, which you might know as Crackdown
And Saints Row gets some price reductions this week
On the Xbox 360 in Japan
Coming out on the Playstation 3, the DualShock 3 makes its way out there
As well as Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock finally comes out in Japan
The Satin Silver, that's what I was trying to think of earlier
The Satin Silver Playstation 3 comes out as well
Continuing our trip in Japan on the Nintendo Wii
Family Jockey comes out in Japan
Also Metroid Prime 3 Corruption
I did not realize this game had quite the delay between the US and Japan
But it is finally coming out in Japan this week
So I guess we're not the only ones that have to wait for big titles sometimes
It looks like Japan had to wait for this one
That's kind of surprised me
And I looked to see if it's a price reduction or something like that
It's not, it's full price
So this must be the first time they're getting that
So that kind of surprised me
Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin
And it comes with a
Nobunaga's ambition something
I don't
Online I think
But it comes with what's called a power-up kit
And I'm not exactly sure what a power-up kit has in it
So this is something they haven't released yet
Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games
Perhaps
The same thing with Double Kings or whatever they call that over there
I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes
It's drugs
Perhaps
But it does look like another version of Nobunaga's Ambition
Dang, the last time I played this game was on the NES
And look how far it's come
It's like Civilization
I remember Civ I, I have such fond memories
It has a Nobunaga's Ambition game that came out
The beginning of February
For PlayStation 2
Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore
They're too complicated for you
I'm not smart enough to play those games
I'll admit it
I think that's just exactly what it boils down to
They're too much for me now
They get too complicated
The Nobunaga's Ambition party game
Yeah, they need like
You know how they dumb down Madden for Wii owners?
That's what I need
I need a dumbed down version of Nobunaga's Ambition
Swing the remote down to conquer Japan
It's too bad they don't have achievement points
And I accidentally closed out my list
So I'll tell you what
Why don't we go to Europe and then we'll come back to Japan
Well you know what that actually makes me think?
Did we ever get a current gen release of Risk?
Not that I can think of
Wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?
It'd be cool if we had Risk and Axis and Allies
Wouldn't that be cool?
That would be very cool
I love games like that
Oh wait, I got the Japanese release dates back
Never mind
Europe can wait a little longer
They're used to it
That was me
It was
Below the bell
I'm sorry
Party foul
Dear European listeners
Please send Rob a smack in the head
Send me your cards and letters
Send me your cards and letters
Whatever, they get Mario Kart early
That's right
So, you know, shut up
Go stuff yourself with a crumpet
Hey
I love Britain
I love all of Europe
I love France
I love Spain
I love them all
Alright
On the PlayStation 2
Also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well
And guess what
There wasn't enough Pachinko in your life
Hisou Pachinko Pachi Slot Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well
By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of Pachinko
Because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that
On the Nintendo DS
Bomberman gets a price cut
Doraemon no Bitaton Midori no Kyojinen DS comes out
In other words, it's Doraemon on the DS yet again
And lastly on the PSP
And then I promise we can do the Europe dates
Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable
That is a combo kit of those games
It's like an Ultimate Hits
So there you have it
And also Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits
The Lenneth and what was the other one?
Slo-Mera or whatever it was called
They both move into the Greatest Hits collection
Alright, now that all of Britain hates me
And Europe in general
Let's go to their release dates, shall we Jamie?
Fine
Well these are all on the 7th
And one of them pisses me off
But I have a certain bias against it
Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
Blacksite Area 51 on PS3
Bully Scholarship Edition, Xbox 360 and Wii
Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed on Wii
Dynasty Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3
Jack Keane on PC
MX vs ATV Untamed on a bunch of crap
Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one
The Destiny of Zorro on Wii
Victorious Boxers on Wii
And the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K Dawn of War
Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?
Victorious
Oh Victorious, I thought you said Victorias
And I'm thinking like, is that like Victoria's Closet for men?
Like now they're expanding
I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls
You mean Victoria's Secret?
She has a penis?
No, I thought you said Victoria's Closet
Oh maybe
That was a really crappy show
That was Veronica's Closet, it was Chrissy Alley
No, Victoria's Secret
I thought I heard her say Victoria's Boxers
Maybe my mind is just focused on underwear right now, I don't know
See, you said Victoria's though
These boxers are victorious!
I'm thinking up Spice Girls
If they're a pair of boxers and on the back of them is a big peace sign
You know, like the V for victory or whatever
A hand doing a V
Please, let's change the topic
I hate Warhammer 40K
Why?
Because I had an ex who did nothing but play Warhammer 40K and paint his retarded little models
On and for days at a time
I tried painting those once and then I saw that they're 6mm tall
I'm like, fuck this, I am not doing this
And I'm a big gamer, I love gaming
But there just comes a point where there's this weird obsession with the little figures
And for building terrain from scratch
And that's all he ever did
So yeah, I broke up with him to play with, you know, to hang out with some guy that played rifts
It was fun though, running over those little figurines with a toy train
Because, you know, if you're going to build your own landscape
You might as well already have a train set and landscape built already for that
Well, I can understand having a project, that's one thing
But when your entire life is your project, that's a little something else
That and you didn't have a job
Speaking about building little figurines
Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spinoffs for different games
Including Indiana Jones and Star Wars
Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo
As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue
But they have screenshots to prove that it's real
You know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts
But, sure, if you want to believe
The minute I saw a headline that said
April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was
I was like, oh, haha, funny, April Fools joke
I hate April Fools
You know
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
It would be cool if it were real
I don't think it is
And I don't think you would try
It's not, come on
You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine
You know
And, of course, it's their exclusive, they say
And stuff like that
Trust me, if this wasn't a real exclusive
1UP.com would be whoring the shit out of this
Right now, okay
Because they like to tease their exclusives
So
Whatever
You don't need any more Halo
Or Lego Halo
Well, I almost thought this was a joke when I first read about it too
But, no, it is true
And it's one of the more interesting types of development in gaming
I've heard in a long time
Okay, here's the thing
You know Treasure made a shooter years ago called Bongio
Bongio
Bongio
Which is not a classic game
Yeah, well, that's right
It's coming out on the DS, right
As Bongio Spirits
Yay
That's not the part I thought was a joke
Here's the part I thought was a joke
It uses what's called sound load
And what you do, you share custom levels
High scores and replay videos
But you don't do it using the built-in Wi-Fi or any of that
No, no
It's sound
That's right
Because the DS has a microphone and a speaker
I guess you put the DS's really close to each other
And what happens is that the data is turned into noises and sound
And it's played out the speaker of, you know, your DS
And then your friend picks it up on his microphone
Or his or her microphone DS
And turned back into game data
What a weird concept
And the other
It's Treasure
Treasure's
And the other thing you can do with this
Is you can put them in like MP3 format or whatever
And spread them out on the internet
So people can download them that way
It's Treasure
It's kind of neat, I'll admit
But I totally, like when I first read this
I'm like, this is the weirdest thing I've ever heard
But yeah, and then I'm thinking like
Wow, we could like put a custom level on our podcast
And be like, okay Bongio owners, turn on your
You know, and that's probably exactly what they want
Which is why this feature's in there, but
Let's do that
Because everybody loves listening to the sound of a modem
When you pick it up
Or if you put a CD in a regular
Or if you put an old CD-ROM in a regular CD player
And you're like
It was like
Did you ever put in the Symphony of the Night CD
And then listen to the hidden track?
Yeah, but the thing about PlayStation
Yes, I have done that
But the thing about PlayStation discs
Is for whatever reason
I don't know if this is the coding or whatever
But if you try to play track one on a PlayStation disc
It's silence
You won't hear the noise that you will
In like an old school
Like, go find yourself a copy of Encarta
And put it in a regular CD player
And if you know what I'm talking about
You're old school
Because we did this in junior high
We would take a copy of Encarta
And put it in a regular CD player
And it makes the most hideous noise
And what you do is
It was like the dumbass joke you would play
Is that you would turn the radio thing up
Full blast
Close the door
And run
Ah, yes
I just remember putting them in
Especially, they'd also do it on PC Engine duo discs
Who say, this is a game disc
Do not listen to this
Or your speakers will die
That type of thing
Very interesting feature
I almost
I have to admit
I kind of
Like, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought
To go run out and buy
Or even really check out
Just because there's too many other games on the table, right?
But now I'm kind of like
I might have to look at this game
Just for this feature
I'll tell you
In one word
Why I'm getting this game
Why?
Treasure
I should have known
Treasure
This whole reason why
I'm still looking for Chameleon Twist
Alright, well
Let's move on
That's all I have to say
Until the game comes out
Well, I know that
Quite a number of our listeners
Are into Rock Band
So, something that everyone should be happy about
Is that there is
A Grateful Dead pack
Coming out for Rock Band
That will have
China Cat Sunflower
Casey Jones
Sugar Magnolia
Trucken
Franklin's Tower
And I Need a Miracle
I think that that's
Pretty cool
Because, you know, Grateful Dead is pretty cool
Now, I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit
Because that would be the full dead experience right there
You know what?
You laugh about that
Apparently
Okay, one of my customers
Oh no
No, no, no, no
Not about the weed thing
No, one of my customers actually
Saw the kit set up
At one of the Game Stops to guest in
Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from
And it was actually pretty funny
He said it just looks like a fog machine with lights
And the lights basically hook up to your sound
They're all sound activated
Like, you know, your sound out
Or whatever your stereo system
And they react to the sound that you do
So we could do the show
And it would react to our speaking and stuff
Just what we need
And that would be funny
Alright, I'm sorry though
Well, there's a little bit more to this story
Hmm
For people who are not so rock band oriented
And are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented
Actually, No Doubt's having some releases on there
Which, No Doubt, cool
Gwen Stefani's solo, bad
Because she sucks
That and she's got mental problems
But, moving on
Wow, tell us what you really think
What songs are coming out from No Doubt?
Do we know?
Don't Speak
Excuse Me Mister
And Sunday Morning
So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend
That's the song I love
No
No Just a Girl
No Spiderwebs
But, I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list
So I'm happy
What song is that?
Don't Speak
Don't Speak
Alright, let's hear some clips of these songs
That are coming to rock band very soon
Here's a clip of the Grateful Dead
So, if you got them, smoke them
Just kidding that's bad
Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in rock band
And then we have coming to
Not coming to Grateful Dead
Coming to Guitar Hero 3
We have No Doubt
And I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak
So let's play one of the more lesser known songs
Which would be Sunday Morning
Sappy Pathetic Little Me
That was the girl I used to be
You had me on my knees
I'm glad I breathed some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and rock band in general
Rock band, the wheels keep on turning with that game
Proud Mary keep on burning?
I don't know
Not yet, maybe someday
Anyhow
And not to be outdone
From the studio that brings you Hannah Montana
Disney has announced a brand new game for the
Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert
No!
It's Ultimate Band
You know, fuck this rock band shit
It's the Ultimate Band
And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS
One thing though that you will be happy to know
And maybe this might be a sad thing
Is that there will not be any peripherals for this game
It'll be all with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck
So you have to imagine how you're gonna actually play these songs
They have a screenshot that shows apparently the guitar portion of the game
Which looks like it's gonna use the two buttons on the nunchuck as your fret buttons
So you have two fret buttons
You have one, two, zero, or both
This sounds like Ultimate Suck
You know what?
I'm gonna say something pretty daring here
I think this actually isn't a bad idea
Because think about who this game is aimed at
It's aimed at kids
And parents don't want to spend all this freakin' money
On all these peripherals that their kids are gonna destroy
So you know what? If you've got a Wii
Why not come out with a game that's very similar to Rock Band
But that you don't have to buy all this extra shit for
And of course I'm not gonna like it
Probably Jamie, Matt, they're not gonna like it
It's not really made for us
I'll try it
It's a kids game
I don't think I'd buy this game
But I'll try it
It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays
And the DS version will have that brand new
CD gamer online social network
Which is sounding pretty awesome
And I really kind of want to check it out
But that means I have to buy a Disney DS game
And I don't know
ActDeft in chat says
Skye speaks the truth
And GS68 says
Skye is right
Ego++
The chat room actually just reminded me
Of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming week
What's that?
Oh I bought Parappa
Oh rad
For $15
At a Hollywood going out of business
Let's see, RasteelUT says
Skye, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the Flames will disagree
Yeah well he's a freak
Hey did I just call a 7 year old a freak?
Cool
That's fine, he's a freak
Uni in chat says
Kids already nom nom the hell out of the Wii remote
Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii remote and hid it under the couch
If you're 7 year old nom noms the Wii remote and hides it under the couch
You got issues
I don't like that phrase, that's funny
What, nom nom?
Nom nom
Didn't you hear?
Everything is Caturday now, everything
Lolcat speak
Cronkyboyjr tries to put out a zinger here saying
You mean we save money on Wii peripherals?
Ba dum bum
Get it?
Because the remotes are so fucking expensive
You don't really have real Wii peripherals
I mean after all there's like what, the classic controller and the nunchuck
That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii
Everything else is plastic shit
Alright well
You know a lot of folks are very excited about this
I'm sure Mo, remember Mo from a couple weeks ago?
Yes
I'm sure she's very excited about this
Still Alive is going to be coming to Rock Band
And Valve threw a little party at Game Developers Conference
And get this, some guy actually tried to steal the song
Here's how it worked, Jonathan Colton was up on stage with his band
They were playing Still Alive but in Rock Band
Because apparently he didn't get 100% on vocals
Which is ironically hilarious
But whatever
So they finish, crowd is cheering
And what happens is that this guy from the crowd gets up on stage
Walks over to the 360, pulls out a memory card
Which I don't know who carries 360 memory cards with them on the go
I mean back in the day I used to carry a Playstation memory card
When I go to the arcade and stuff
Because DDR machines had the memory card slots
You could have two or three of those
I can't think of any reason why you would put a 360 card in your pocket everywhere you go
But whatever, it's Game Developers Conference, whatever
So he pulls out this memory card
He puts it in, messes around
And then finally one of the Harmonix guys walks over
And says what's going on
And this guy says I'm just grabbing Still Alive
Everyone needs to be able to play this
Well the developer took it back
And deleted the thing off the card
And all is well
Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway
Because it was probably a dev 360
And I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild
It wouldn't have worked anyways
Because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management
Which we'll get into later
Well apparently the guy actually wrote about it
The only reason I'm not giving this idiot of the week award
Or stupid guy of the week
Or whatever we're calling it in your award
Is because apparently the guy wrote about it in his live journal
And I don't know, don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate
It could be fanfic or some shit
I don't know
But I think it's legit
You can check it out on his live journal
It's algorithmancy.livejournal.com
That's A-L-G-O-R-I-T-A-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com
And he writes in this entry on February 21, 2008
He writes his side of the story
And he puts a disclaimer at the end
He says don't try this at home
The only reason I did
Because I am an acquaintance of Alex
Who works at Harmonix
As well as good friends with several Harmonix folks
And game industry friends give each other free swag all the time
Remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material is theft
So
You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?
Huh
He's got a cool live journal name
That's it
It was kind of a dumb thing to do
But at least he admits it was a little
It was a lot of a dumb thing to do
At least he kind of admits in his live journal thing
That it was a lot of dumb
So you know
I'm not going to stupid award him
When he begs for mercy
That's what you get when you drink lots of alcohols
Exactly
Alcohol bad
But still alive
Good
Alright, before we wrap up
Huh, what's that?
I said quite
Before we wrap
Are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in the studio?
No
Did you hear our idea
I don't remember if this is the week you were gone
Because February was all fucked up
But were you here the week we had the idea
That when it comes out
We'll get Mo back
And she'll be our vocalist
And we'll get Matt to play drums
You can play guitar
You and I can work out the guitar somehow
And we'll have an OR band
And we'll do our rendition
It was mentioned last week
Was it last week?
I can't remember
I'm getting old and the weeks blend together
That's okay Rob
Alright
Anyhow
I'm still bringing you your birthday present
Sweet
Alright
Speaking of getting old
The older we get
The more we reminisce about the classic games
And that's why we like to pay tribute
To the classic game of the week every week
Dark Sakura likes to respect her elders
In the gaming world
By paying tribute to old classic games
So let's dust off a dusty game
And see what Dark Sakura's picked
For this week's classic game of the week
What is it?
This is actually one of my favorite arcade games ever
And I have it on Saturn
It's Cyber Troopers Virtual On
Which is a 3D robot fighting game
Done from a behind the view
Of your own character who you're playing
Let's take a listen
And almost every other sample of it online was horrible
So moving forward
You basically play as a virtualoid
A giant robot controlled by a person
Which is actually pretty funny
Because there are little insert things
Where the pilots go in the back of the market for Saturn
In the sequel Virtual On
Oritario Tangrum was a dreamcast
Which I have that game too and I got it
But you would play as a number of them
With different specialties
Like you have the Temjin
Which is the balanced one
You have the Raiden
Which is a heavy battle one
Really strong and heavily armed
You have the Amp Arms
Which is one of the fast ones
It uses a tom-po weapon
You have Belgor
Which is a missile launcher
The Dorcas
Which is another pretty heavy one
The Viper 2
The Basbal Bow
And my favorite which is the Feiyen
Which is like the cute world
The Mecha
Which is really fast and nice
You have the Z-Grat
And then you have the Jaguarladi
Which is as far as I remember
I think it was one of the hidden ones
But in the arcade you had a 2% set up
And it had a dividing wall in between
So you were like in the cockpit
And it used two sticks to control it
And on Saturn they did release the twin sticks
And I actually don't have them
Which makes me very upset
Because I had a chance to get them
They did do an Oratorio Tangram
That was on the Dreamcast
I actually do have the twin sticks for that
In fact, you remember your ex-roommate?
Yes
We beat him getting them
Interesting
We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento
Whoa, whoa, whoa
We're not talking about the one I lived with
Oh, we're talking about that room
That roommate
Wow
Those were the days, man
Those were the days
The guy who sold it to us
Ended up being
My husband
Ended up being
I do believe Mo's manager
It's
You know, I know
We're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town
But at any rate
We came in
We saw the twin sticks for 45 bucks
Which was astounding at that time
And like
We want to buy these right now
And I was like
Okay
And then
A person who's
As far as I knew
His nickname
Came from this game
Came in and we beat him by like 10 minutes
So
There were also other versions
There was
Cyber Troopers
Virtual on Force
That was only in Japanese arcades in 2001
And
Virtual on Mars
Which was
The PS2 release
So
There's also an audio drama for it
Which is kind of funny
And then there was a musical one
Which was the
The Feiyun robot singing
I actually have a Feiyun garage kit that I still have yet to put together
That I bought like six years ago
Nice
Virtual on's like
Tops
Alright
Well that's going to do it
Your classic game of the week
Virtual on
Here on Orange Lawn's radio
And on that note
We're going to go ahead and take a break
It is the end of part A
That's right
It's not a short show this week
We're all here
It's like you're finally getting a full OLR
Now it's like three weeks later
After
Jamie being sick
Us having no show
And then having a short show
The month of February was screwed
But there's plenty more of
Regular
Good old fashioned
Hopefully unbroken
OLR left
To go
Lots of stories coming up in part B
If you thought part A was PlayStation heavy
Which it was
Because there was a lot of PlayStation news this week
Which
Hopefully those people that email us every now and then say
You don't show Sony enough love
You guys hate Sony
Hopefully
We did you wrong tonight
We have plenty of Sony
Sony stories tonight
But in the next segment
Lots of Nintendo news came out as well
So we'll be getting all the Nintendo news in the next segment
And some other randomness
Such as
What is the guy that created Pong up to now?
You might be surprised
So we're going to take a quick break
And we'll be right back with more of Orange Lawn's radio
Right after this
Orange
Lawn's
Radio
Hi guys
It's Rob here with an important footnote
For our podcast listeners
There's no easy way for me to break the news
But part B this week was lost
And unfortunately won't be hitting the podcast feed
And you won't get that news we promised
Unless you were listening live
And heard all two hours of it being taped
So I'm sure you're wondering
What happened?
Well what happened is that we were
Taping the shows we always do
We do a special little show after that called The Afterbirth
It's only for live listeners
And because we play licensed music and stuff
That we can't put on the podcast
And as we were taping that
Right at the very end
We were trying to unjumble some of the chords back here
And the power cord to the computer got detached
And the whole damn thing shut off
And although Audition keeps a temporary file on hand
When I went in to recover the file
I'm in a mistake and ended up deleting the damn files
I was trying to make a backup copy of it
And I've tried everything
I can't get
It's not in the recycle bin
Picked the chat room's brain on it
It's gone
It ain't coming back
So I'm very sorry
And just when I was thinking March wouldn't be as broken as February
Anyhow
I guess one silver lining to this
Is that if you do want to hear part B
It is still archived on the Justin TV channel
So you can go to Justin.tv slash Orange Launch Radio
And I believe some of our listeners are trying to make a highlight of the show right now
Now it's become this big lost archive of the show
It's like a collector's item of sorts
We will try to get an audio rip of that
We're probably not going to put it on the podcast feed
Because the audio quality on Justin TV is not great
Our microphones don't hook into that
It simply goes to our webcam
And the audio is really not great
We'll probably, if anything, if we can get an audio rip of that
We'll probably put it on MySpace, Facebook, and all that stuff
Unfortunately part A, as all the podcast listeners are going to get this week
I am so sorry
In six years that we've been doing this show
We've never lost a show like that
So it's kind of embarrassing
And a little sad
Especially off of a few broken weeks in a row
But what can you do?
Life goes on
I hope everybody has a wonderful week
Happy gaming
And we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week
With all new power chords in studio
Have a good one
