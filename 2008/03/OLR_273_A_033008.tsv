7000	13000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Mojo.
14000	19000	Tonight, March 30th, 2008, gamerscore hackers get the Smackdown from Microsoft,
19000	24000	Rock Band is announced for the Wii, and is another PSP redesign on the way.
24000	27000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	44000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only, DarkSakura.
49000	50000	Jamie Summers.
50000	51000	Roar.
51000	53000	How are you doing? Ah, I'm scared.
53000	54000	Roar.
55000	58000	Are things going good for you?
58000	60000	Fairly decently.
60000	62000	Ah, alright. That's good to hear.
62000	64000	Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
64000	65000	Hello.
65000	66000	How are you doing, Loki?
66000	67000	I'm fine.
67000	68000	Alright, glad to hear it.
68000	69000	Cool, cool.
69000	74000	Well, let's start off tonight's show, which is not our last show on lifethusts5.com.
74000	77000	I did a boo-boo in the math last week.
77000	81000	I don't know how I did this, but you know, we got the announcement about, you know,
81000	85000	how to make decisions about what the hell is going to happen with the show, the station going offline.
85000	88000	Not the show, but the station going offline in a couple of weeks.
88000	90000	Somehow, I did the math wrong when I looked at the calendar.
90000	93000	I thought tonight was the last show on lifethusts5, but it's actually next Saturday.
93000	95000	Or next...
95000	97000	Apparently, I still can't read a calendar.
97000	100000	It's next Sunday is going to be the last show on lifethusts5.
100000	102000	I somehow missed that there was one more week in March.
102000	103000	So, whatever.
103000	105000	So, here we are on March 30th.
105000	108000	April 6th will be the last show on lifethusts5.com.
108000	113000	And then April 13th, something else, which we'll get to in a little bit.
113000	115000	The future of Orange Lounge Radio.
115000	121000	We'll talk about that in a little bit, but I wouldn't want to get away from how we usually start things off with.
121000	123000	How was your gaming week?
123000	128000	It was very Ragnarok-ing, as usual.
128000	137000	And then I turned on my DS to play some Final Fantasy VI and then turned it off promptly because I ran out of time.
137000	142000	And that was pretty much it.
142000	143000	Oh, yeah.
143000	147000	And we were going to be able to get another pinball machine, but that fell through.
147000	149000	Which pinball machine?
149000	152000	Attack from Mars.
152000	153000	Oh, I like that one.
153000	155000	One of the pinball 2000 ones.
155000	156000	Yeah.
156000	158000	Well, that's one with the holograms in it. I love that one.
158000	161000	But we were sort of dicked around on it, so it fell through.
161000	163000	We played one of those at, like, Huzar one time.
163000	166000	We put rubber bands on the side so that the ball can't fall down.
166000	168000	Oh, lots of fun.
168000	175000	Well, we were somehow going to get it for $1500 because the guy was selling that and Adam's family and two other machines.
175000	181000	And then the people who were going to go in with Dan and Will to buy it ended up not doing it.
181000	185000	So it was like, oh, yeah, one of the other machines was, like, Fish Tales, which I've never heard of.
185000	188000	And I was like, who owns a fishing pinball machine?
188000	191000	So, yeah.
191000	194000	So it was almost eventful in the realm of pinball.
194000	203000	But, you know, obviously anybody who's been listening to this show for any significant amount of time knows that you have a love obsession with pinball.
203000	211000	Besides Big Bang Bar, the Uber Rare table, what pinball table would you like to own more than anything?
211000	218000	I actually have a pan list of a couple.
218000	227000	One of them would actually be Black Knight 2000 because we have actually a Black Knight right now that we're borrowing.
227000	232000	Oh, God, I know what this is called.
232000	235000	It's one that's like an airplane theme, like a jet theme.
235000	241000	They had it at Pin-A-Go-Go and it was, the whole game was, like, nothing but ramps, pretty much.
241000	243000	Cool. Fun.
243000	244000	I'll have to find the name of it.
244000	247000	How about an old school original pinbot? That's what I want more than anything.
247000	248000	The Bride of Pinbot.
248000	252000	The Bride of Pinbot's pretty rad, but I want old school original pinbot.
252000	256000	The one I'm thinking of, though, is Theater of Magic.
256000	261000	Theater of Magic, maybe Addams Family, but Theater of Magic would definitely be on the top of my list.
261000	264000	I mean, I have the machine I want most.
264000	267000	I have World Cup Soccer 94.
267000	270000	That is the machine to me. I have the one I want.
270000	272000	And the husband's not allowed to sell that ever.
272000	274000	Ever.
274000	277000	And I have the other one that I really like, which is Twilight Zone.
277000	278000	Oh, cool.
278000	282000	So, those two were up there for my two favorite tables.
282000	283000	You know Dr. Who's pinball?
283000	286000	We actually are working on Still Trying to Get Me a Dr. Who.
286000	287000	Very cool.
287000	292000	I almost bought the TARDIS out of a Dr. Who on eBay, and then I was like, but it's not...
292000	297000	I remember, like, working, like I said, working in Qzart and it had that yelling in the background
297000	302000	because there's just being a little demo loop with EXTERMINATE!
302000	305000	It's like, okay, enough of that.
305000	308000	A Tommy machine wouldn't be bad.
308000	309000	Tommy, can you hear me?
309000	312000	It has the giant pinball on top.
312000	314000	I like the Jurassic Park pinball.
314000	317000	That's when I was like, because the big dinosaur came down and ate your ball.
317000	320000	But my favorite table ever was Addams Family game.
320000	321000	I love that one.
321000	323000	We have a Simpsons pinball party.
323000	325000	That machine's a bitch.
325000	326000	Why is that?
326000	327000	It's hard.
327000	328000	Oh my god, is that the one I...
328000	331000	And Dan got rid of my Rocky and Bullwinkle, which I really liked.
331000	332000	Aww.
332000	336000	But Stern is bringing out a new Indiana Jones table.
336000	338000	I don't know if I mentioned that.
338000	339000	So that's pretty cool.
339000	340000	Yeah, I think last week.
340000	341000	So that's cool.
341000	342000	That's pretty cool.
342000	343000	All right.
343000	344000	Sorry.
344000	345000	The market's still there.
345000	346000	There definitely is still a market for pinball.
346000	349000	It's fun, and there's still rabid fans for that.
349000	350000	But we're getting off base.
350000	352000	Do you play for Klonoa 2?
352000	353000	What's that?
353000	357000	Someone in chat's playing Klonoa 2, and that game's fucking awesome and very depressing.
357000	361000	You know what would bring pinball back is if they made a way to make it competitive
361000	363000	against, you know, a couple tables.
363000	364000	They've had...
364000	369000	I've actually had sort of like a cocktail machine that had two sides on it.
369000	376000	At Classic Gaming Expo, and I think I've seen it there, and at Pinagogo, they have the versus
376000	377000	tables.
377000	378000	But those are...
378000	380000	They're not very fun.
380000	383000	If you want to join our chat room so Jamie can have random outbursts at the games you're
383000	388000	playing this week, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go do it.
388000	393000	Meanwhile, Loki, I'm thinking you're going to bring us back to console games with your
393000	394000	gaming week.
394000	395000	Yes.
395000	399000	This week I played Crisis Core, so that was pretty cool.
399000	405000	It's definitely a lot different than, say, your typical Final Fantasy RPG.
405000	407000	I'm not sure if it's too similar to 12.
407000	411000	The combat system's sort of real time, I guess.
411000	415000	You run around and you kind of mash buttons, but it's okay.
415000	419000	It's very linear so far, but like I said, I'm not that far in the game.
419000	424000	But if it continues the way it is, it's a very linear game.
424000	426000	But it's fun so far.
426000	427000	I love the cutscenes, though.
427000	429000	The cutscenes are pretty awesome.
429000	434000	Then I've also played Saints Row, actually the single player, because I'm trying to finish
434000	437000	it before Grand Theft Auto IV comes out.
437000	438000	Almost done with the game, though.
438000	440000	I'm on the last third.
440000	446000	And then I played just some weird stuff that we'll be probably getting into later, like
446000	450000	that Romjek Fail and Tetroid 2012.
450000	452000	That game's weird.
452000	456000	It's like Tetris and Silent Hill with Arkanoid.
456000	461000	I have to see this, because when Loki says, it's Tetris meets Silent Hill, I'm like, what
461000	464000	the hell is that supposed to mean?
464000	465000	It's weird, though.
465000	466000	All right.
466000	467000	You've got to check it out.
467000	468000	All right.
468000	469000	I will.
469000	470000	That's pretty much it.
470000	475000	I think I may have played a little bit of Brawl in there, too, at some point.
475000	479000	The cool thing, though, because mainly this entire week I've been busy trying to get that
479000	487000	stupid 360 working, the second one that went down, and finally fixed it, actually.
487000	488000	Basically at a certain point.
488000	490000	It's always when I just say, okay, fuck it.
490000	491000	It's not going to work ever again.
491000	494000	I'm just going to go all out.
494000	499000	What I did was I took the heat gun and really concentrated it on the GPU chip or whatever,
499000	501000	and I got a different error code.
501000	505000	I found out that the error code means that the RAM has a bad solder joint, and there's
505000	506000	a way to fix that.
506000	511000	You just put a couple washers on there, and you're supposed to superglue them or adhere
511000	512000	them to it.
512000	516000	I did that, and then tightened it up, and sure enough, it worked just fine.
516000	522000	Now we have one more to go, but this one, that was a lot easier, because I bought a
522000	527000	replacement warranty sticker, so I'm going to slap that on there and put the old case
527000	529000	back on there and send it to Microsoft.
529000	530000	I pray it works.
530000	534000	This one didn't work at all.
534000	540000	So far, three out of six have broken, but I fixed two out of the three, so that's not
540000	542000	bad so far.
542000	543000	Nice.
543000	545000	Is there anything else to report?
545000	546000	Nothing else?
546000	548000	That's pretty much it.
548000	554000	Hopefully we'll have some cool stuff to show Justin.tv later, but right now, that's about
554000	555000	it.
555000	557680	Speaking of Justin.tv, we do have a webcam feed of our show.
557680	558680	It's kind of crap tonight.
558680	563800	I don't know, the Wi-Fi is kind of in and out tonight, so it's been cutting in and out,
563800	567680	but if you want to check it out, www.Justin.tv slash Orange Launch Radio is where our cam
567680	568680	is at.
568680	571520	Meanwhile, my gaming week, I kind of had a retro week.
571520	572520	I don't know what it is.
572520	576440	I fired up Xbox Live one day, and I was just like, I'm going to go through and play all
576440	578240	these old games again.
578240	581760	Sometimes you get in that mood for retro, at least I do.
581760	584440	I get in those moods where I want to play Root Beer Tapper today.
584440	588680	Yeah, I've played the game a million times, but it's still one of my favorites from way
588680	589680	back yonder.
589680	595280	So I was playing Root Beer Tapper, Tempest, and some of the other things on Xbox Live
595280	604280	that are not like scream up and down and shout and type wonderful games, but they are classics.
604280	607480	Some of them, I don't even like the upgraded versions, and some of them, I don't think
607480	610280	I like the upgraded version of Tempest nearly as much as the original.
610280	614360	I don't know if it's just like, I can't see as much of what's going on or what have you,
614360	615360	but whatever.
615360	622720	I got some old achievements that for some reason I never got, so it was kind of fun.
622720	628900	Also checked out that new release, T-Quall, whatever that new puzzle game is on Xbox Live
628900	631280	this week, which is okay.
631280	634280	It's kind of like Tetris meets Luminous, sort of.
634280	638440	You have to make the little blocks that you do in Luminous, but you make them with Tetris
638440	640440	shaped pieces in different colors.
640440	643580	And it's not just two colors, it's like four different colors.
643580	645480	It's kind of different.
645480	648600	There's a lot of different power ups.
648600	653940	It's interesting though because the presentation of the game, the whole fact that it's kind
653940	659280	of like that tribal jungle Amazon type thing really reminds me of Zuma.
659280	660280	Yeah, I was going to say that.
660280	662560	No other game has.
662560	666700	It seems like some of the sound effects are ripped right out of Zuma, but yet I don't
666700	668360	believe this game is a PopCap game.
668360	670000	I believe it's made by somebody else.
670000	672320	Now the game itself has nothing to do with Zuma.
672320	674880	I mean, the games themselves are completely separate except for the fact that they're
674880	676660	both puzzle-ish games.
676660	680700	They have that other one too that's just like kind of Zuma or the same tribal thing.
680700	683840	It was, not Crystal Quest.
683840	684840	It was...
684840	685840	Oh, Magnetica.
685840	692200	No, no, no, no, not like Zuma, I'm talking about the tribal thing, it's an Xbox Live
692200	693200	Arcade game.
693200	694200	Oh, Jewel Quest.
694200	697980	Jewel Quest, yeah.
697980	702760	And Jewel Quest is like bejeweled with one little twist to it.
702760	703840	It's interesting.
703840	707880	But I didn't end up really buying the full version of it because the demo gives you really
707880	712860	good taste of the game and I just, I don't know, I can't keep justifying these little
712860	717480	five and ten dollar purchases for games I'm not going to play more than a couple times.
717480	719460	So that's that.
719460	724680	Some days I do wish Xbox Live would switch to that model of you just pay a point, there's
724680	727480	so many points, just play the game a couple times, you know what I mean?
727480	728480	Like a rental?
728480	730580	Like a regular arcade or a rental, I don't know.
730580	732080	But that'll never happen.
732080	733080	So.
733080	738440	Gerardimo in chat says, Tikal, or Tikal, how in the hell are you supposed to pronounce
738440	739440	that even?
739440	740440	Tikal?
740440	741440	I would guess it would be Tikal.
741440	742440	Tikal?
742440	746320	I think it would be Tikal because the U would not give, there's no U there.
746320	747320	Yeah, all right, Tikal.
747320	750760	It means like T-qual, like Tiki or Tikal.
750760	751760	I like Tikal.
751760	756680	Gerardimo says Tikal, a mashup of good puzzle games, why did you expect it to be decent?
756680	758040	Because I like puzzle games.
758040	761400	And I would say it's decent, it just didn't, like it didn't wow me.
761400	764720	Like the first time I played Luminous I was like, this game is the shit, I love this game.
764720	769680	It didn't wow me, but it wasn't horrible either.
769680	773200	The other thing I did during my gaming week, you know I'm like, I think I mentioned this
773200	777040	a couple weeks ago on the show, I've been really late to the Steam bandwagon, you know,
777040	782960	on the PC, getting Steam and checking that out, which is kind of like XFire meets Xbox
782960	787640	Live meets an online type store kind of thing on your PC.
787640	791440	I downloaded that a couple weeks ago and I finally bought a game this week.
791440	795840	And the game I bought was Portal, because Loki finally took his copy of the Orange Box
795840	800400	backs a little while ago, and I was very sad I couldn't play that on Xbox 360 anymore.
800400	804280	But the only game in there I was like really, really missing and wanting to play again was
804280	805280	Portal.
805280	810960	And I'll tell you what, big difference, and I know this is like a classic debate, but
810960	814960	it's not something I often think about because I do most of my gaming on console and, you
814960	819080	know, World of Warcraft on the PC and a couple other things here and there, I don't have
819080	824280	to think about this, but there really is a world of difference between keyboard and mouse
824280	825920	and two analog sticks.
825920	830920	Like, I think I actually do a lot better with the keyboard and mouse than I do analog sticks,
830920	831920	you know?
831920	835720	And, you know, I know it's a classic debate, people say this is better, this is better.
835720	838800	I might actually be a little better at Halo if I could use a keyboard and mouse in it.
838800	841960	And yes, I know I could get Halo 2 and Vista, but I don't have Vista, so.
841960	847240	Well, you can also get one of the, they have the T-mix, the cuter stuff that you can buy
847240	850800	that, you know, can hook up a keyboard and mouse and do it that way.
850800	856040	I do like how you actually fire the portal gun with a PC, your left or right click.
856040	857040	Yeah.
857040	858640	I see, I think that that's a little bit more intuitive.
858640	865440	Yeah, I don't know, I just, I like, I kind of like the feel of it on the PC a little
865440	867760	better than I did on the Xbox 360.
867760	872080	You know, the Xbox 360, I could still play that on my big screen TV and it was loud and
872080	876320	it was nice, you know, and this one, whereas I have a wide screen monitor out here, it's
876320	880300	not very big, but it's still pretty, so, you know, same game.
880300	883200	You know we love Portal here at Orange Launch Radio, I don't have a lot else to say about
883200	887040	the game, but just kind of making that transition was very interesting, because it's the exact
887040	891160	same game, just playing it two different ways, and I think I actually do a lot better with
891160	895140	the mouse, and I think part of what Jamie said has a lot to do with that, just the way
895140	899920	you control the firing and just the movement is different and all that, so.
899920	906040	It took me a minute to get used to moving, though, because sometimes with the whole WASD,
906040	909680	like I think if you hit two of them at the same time, it gets confused, like, you know,
909680	914160	it's a little unlike World of Warcraft, which also does WASD, but anyway.
914160	918960	One thing I will say about the difference on there, too, just for perspective, I get
918960	922360	more motion sick watching it on a TV.
922360	927300	Is it because it's just bigger, and so more of your vision is taken up by the images?
927300	934600	That could possibly be it, but I was watching on a wide screen laptop before.
934600	938560	RossdielUT in chat says, Street Fighter would be an atrocity on a keyboard and mouse.
938560	944680	Yeah, I remember an old, actually, I had Street Fighter II Turbo, Super Duper, whatever it
944680	949560	was, the last big one they did, they had a computer version of it on CD that had Redbook
949560	954480	audio for the different stages, like redone music, and so yeah, I had that on the PC,
954480	959100	and I played it on the keyboard, and it's just not the same, it's just not the same.
959100	962360	And then I go way, way back, and I think about Stick Fighter.
962360	963360	Stick Fighter is fucking awesome.
963360	968680	If you've ever played Stick Fighter, remember that game back in the day?
968680	971560	If you've never played Stick Fighter, it's gotta be out there on the internet somewhere.
971560	973720	It was one of those, like, back in the shareware days.
973720	977960	You probably have to get a slowdown program to make it work okay, I imagine it's like,
977960	983000	way, but Stick Fighter was a Street Fighter II clone, but it used nothing but stick figures,
983000	986360	but they actually stole voice samples out of the game and some of the later versions,
986360	987360	it was great.
987360	989360	That was great.
989360	995160	All right, let's get into tonight's housekeeping, since we're done with our gaming weeks, we'll
995160	998440	get into housekeeping tonight, and I know the question on everybody's mind is, okay,
998440	1001920	we dropped that bombshell last week, that Orange Lounge Radio is going to be closing
1001920	1007840	its doors as a live 24 hour a day, seven day a week station as of April 12th.
1007840	1014360	I'm sorry, April, yeah, no, April 12th is our last broadcast day.
1014360	1018020	So you know, there's been a lot of question, and this all came up very last minute for
1018020	1019020	us last week.
1019020	1023200	Apparently, we found out about it like 45 minutes before we went live.
1023200	1028360	So we really had to kind of scramble to figure out what we were going to do.
1028360	1034680	I want to kind of thank everybody that sent us emails this week and sent us private messages
1034680	1040960	and all of that sort and posts on forums and things with suggestions for us.
1040960	1044400	I think I got told to check out about 10 different websites.
1044400	1049600	A couple people actually offered to host a streaming thing for us.
1049600	1053280	I wasn't able to do a lot of research on that, but I think that's very cool that people would
1053280	1055420	do that.
1055420	1058240	But ultimately, we decided to take things in a different direction, and it was kind
1058240	1062660	of the first thing that came, it was the first idea that we had here at Orange Lounge Radio
1062660	1065020	to do with the future of the show.
1065020	1071680	And first, let me say this as well, chat, it's not April Fool's, okay?
1071680	1073320	It just so happens live 365.
1073320	1076920	You know, if you've listened to this show long enough, you know we freaking hate April
1076920	1077920	Fool's Day, okay?
1077920	1081080	So the last thing we would do is do something crappy like that for April Fool's Day.
1081080	1083940	This is not an April Fool's joke, okay?
1083940	1086960	So now I lost my train of thought.
1086960	1087960	Damn you, chat.
1087960	1088960	What was I saying?
1088960	1089960	Oh, yes.
1089960	1094760	So the first idea that came to our minds is the one we decided to go with.
1094760	1100900	So we emailed some people and did some talking, and it looks like everybody's on board.
1100900	1105840	So this is what's going to happen, folks, starting April 13th, that's episode number
1105840	1113200	275 of our show, we will now be officially a part of AllGames.com.
1113200	1119240	We are going to merge, essentially, some of our shows from our station with the operations
1119240	1121800	they have over at AllGames.com.
1121800	1129160	And in a way, I've been kind of joking all week long, it's creating a Voltron of independent
1129160	1134080	podcasting, and that's kind of what I really believe in what's going to happen.
1134080	1138920	Because while we could have set up our own feed and taken one of these offers to set
1138920	1143800	up our own thing and run our own music feed and live thing, music and all that stuff takes
1143800	1145240	a long time to set up.
1145240	1150520	It's more than just putting MP3s at random, trust me for this.
1150520	1158340	So it's kind of like, why would we want to do that and run this whole separate thing
1158340	1163200	when there's this perfectly established station going on over there that we already have a
1163200	1166360	good relationship with because our show's been syndicated over on the network.
1166360	1170880	We know the people there, we like the people over there, we're kind of something different-ish
1170880	1174380	on the network, it's a type of show they don't have otherwise.
1174380	1181900	Why go run off and do our own thing when we can instead come together and form a bigger
1181900	1182920	and better station?
1182920	1184880	Because look at all the experience that's going to be going into this.
1184880	1190800	You've got All Games, they've been up for what, 10, 11 years, like a shitload long time.
1190800	1192320	We've been running for five and a half years.
1192320	1195600	You take all that experience and bring it together, that's going to be awesome.
1195600	1198440	And here, let me tell you guys the perks as far as live listener goes.
1198440	1203320	This means no more registering to sign up to listen up, no more listener caps.
1203320	1206920	I think there is a listener cap on All Games, but it's like 1,000 or some ungodly number
1206920	1209760	will never hit.
1209760	1212600	There's the fact that you can listen to it on your PSP now.
1212600	1218760	If you check out allgames.com on your PSP, and I believe it's one of the preset stations
1218760	1223160	in the PSP as well.
1223160	1224320	It's going to be a good thing.
1224320	1228280	The more and more I think about it, the more I think this is the right idea for us.
1228280	1234560	Here also, I have no announcements at this time as far as our other shows go, speaking
1234560	1242260	of Travis Donovan and DMN, however, we are in talks to have that be a part of the merge,
1242260	1244320	and they didn't say no.
1244320	1245320	Right now, that's all in limbo.
1245320	1249120	I have nothing further to say at this time, but that is exciting that some of our other
1249120	1254720	stuff will probably go over there as well if everybody's happy.
1254720	1256560	Let's put it that way.
1256560	1258480	I think it'll be good though.
1258480	1260160	I think it's going to be a great thing.
1260160	1261160	Anything else you guys want to add?
1261160	1262160	I got nothing to add.
1262160	1263160	Nothing to add?
1263160	1264160	Dark Sakura?
1264160	1265160	I like pastrami.
1265160	1267160	You like pastrami?
1267160	1272720	Yes, none of the content of our show is going to change, and that's the other great thing
1272720	1278340	about this mergingwithallgames.com is that they know our shtick.
1278340	1279480	They know what we do.
1279480	1284160	They don't want us to change anything, so we're not going to.
1284160	1289180	We might do some aesthetic type changes with this move, like we might take the opportunity
1289180	1293140	to clean up our album art, maybe do a different audio.
1293140	1296860	We might make some small aesthetical changes, but as far as the content that you're actually
1296860	1300120	going to hear in the show, nothing's going to change in that regard.
1300120	1304120	According to Jamie, there will be more pastrami.
1304120	1305240	There may be more pastrami.
1305240	1308440	We'll have to work on that, but nothing's going to change.
1308440	1312100	As far as podcasts go, if you guys are listening on the podcast only and you've never been
1312100	1317480	able to join us for the live experience, not a damn thing's going to change for you, really.
1317480	1321520	We might experiment with some different sound qualities because we're actually going to
1321520	1326040	be broadcasting a higher quality over on allgames.com than we were here, so we might change some
1326040	1329400	things in the way we're distributing the podcast, but honestly, you're not going to have to
1329400	1331600	change your subscription or anything like that.
1331600	1332880	You're still going to get the podcast.
1332880	1335560	It's like nothing ever happened for you guys if you've never listened to us live.
1335560	1336560	It's going to be like nothing ever happened.
1336560	1339480	I hate to say it, even though the sound may be in higher quality, the show will not.
1339480	1344520	Yes, the show will not be in higher quality, I'm sorry to say.
1344520	1345520	There it is.
1345520	1346520	I don't know.
1346520	1347760	Is there anything else to add?
1347760	1348760	Anything else we should say?
1348760	1349760	I don't think so.
1349760	1350760	I'm out of soda.
1350760	1351760	That's not good.
1351760	1355840	When I say no content change, that also means everything the live folks are used to, like
1355840	1359340	the little special thing we do after the show that we call the afterbirth, that is actually
1359340	1361600	not going away, and I was very surprised.
1361600	1365000	I thought we might have to make some changes to that, but they were very open, and we don't
1365000	1367040	have to change anything about our afterbirth.
1367040	1368040	Very excited.
1368040	1370360	We don't have to change anything.
1370360	1375320	Oh, well, maybe we'll have to remove the segment of Make Fun of Bobby Black Wolf.
1375320	1378440	Oh, yeah, we will have to get rid of the Make Fun of Bobby Black Wolf segment, probably,
1378440	1384760	but that's all right.
1384760	1386520	I think that's about it.
1386520	1390300	Nothing else to say, so I guess we're going to move into... I'm wondering if there's
1390300	1391880	any other questions in chat.
1391880	1392880	Let's see.
1392880	1394720	Am I still able to tune in with iTunes and WinApp?
1394720	1397880	Yes, and you'll be able to do it a whole lot easier, actually, because you don't have to
1397880	1406720	register for Light
1406720	1415480	of the Week.
1415480	1417600	I need it easier than that.
1417600	1418600	I don't.
1418600	1419680	Bookmark it.
1419680	1421960	I don't know what else to tell you.
1421960	1427040	Zlatan asks, will it be 30 seconds behind Live 365?
1427040	1431580	I do not think the buffer will be as great, because I think we're having to... Because
1431580	1436600	right now we send from my computer to Live 365, who encodes it to their server that's
1436600	1439720	in... I don't think it's going to be as much of a delay.
1439720	1443960	I think there will still be a delay, but that's inevitable because of the encoding process,
1443960	1446240	but it won't be like 30 seconds.
1446240	1447240	It'll be an hour.
1447240	1450400	Oh, Bobby Black Wolf is in chat helping to clear the air right now.
1450400	1451400	Thank you, Bobby.
1451400	1455920	He actually says it still will be 30 seconds, but that's just inevitable, because it's buffer
1455920	1456920	and all that stuff.
1456920	1460320	Rasteel UT says, fuck that.
1460320	1461740	Bring Black Wolf on and make fun of him.
1461740	1462920	We just might do that, actually.
1462920	1464680	No, we love Bobby, of course.
1464680	1468960	Bobby has actually been very instrumental in making this happen, so we love Bobby.
1468960	1475080	Actually, that's another really good thing, is because when we're live on Sunday nights,
1475080	1479940	Bobby's show airs at 5 o'clock, and he says that he's going to keep his show to an hour.
1479940	1483440	Maybe occasionally he'll run over, but very little.
1483440	1487800	The nice thing is, is that instead of having just kind of like music as a lead in, we're
1487800	1490440	going to have a really good quality show.
1490440	1494760	It's almost like being on a real television network, where you have a quality show as
1494760	1496400	a lead in to your show.
1496400	1499880	It's going to be great, and I think the listeners are really going to benefit, and we're all
1499880	1503660	going to benefit, because we'll get some of Bobby's people, he'll get some of our people.
1503660	1506400	That's all goes into the Voltron of independent podcasting, the future.
1506400	1509640	It's like when they have heroes on, and then they have Chuck, and then everyone turns the
1509640	1511320	TV off when Chuck comes on.
1511320	1514160	Well, I'm hoping it doesn't go like that, but maybe.
1514160	1515160	Rob.
1515160	1516160	What?
1516160	1519000	Will it blend?
1519000	1521080	It may indeed blend.
1521080	1524080	We'll see.
1524080	1529080	We2 in chat says, as usual, OLR is the gamer tech podcast, whatever happened to OLR Food
1529080	1530080	Network.
1530080	1531920	OLR Food Network is still here.
1531920	1533520	Pastrami, Jamie?
1533520	1534520	Yum.
1534520	1535520	All right.
1535520	1537920	With cheese and grilled onions, and no burger.
1537920	1538920	All right.
1538920	1539920	I'm so mad.
1539920	1543760	So this is going to be a good thing, but regardless, we really appreciate those of you guys that
1543760	1547520	have supported our own live feed over the past five and a half years of our music feed.
1547520	1551380	I know some of you guys were listening to us at work, but now you have allgames.com
1551380	1552380	to listen to.
1552380	1553380	You always did.
1553380	1556060	They play music during the day.
1556060	1560640	They play a different mix of video game music than we did, but it's a good mix of music.
1560640	1565040	It's a little more current mix of music in some regards, and they also have talk radio
1565040	1568400	that plays throughout the day, which I think is highly entertaining, and you never know
1568400	1569840	what might happen in the future.
1569840	1570840	You never know.
1570840	1574680	This is going to free all of us up to kind of be working towards a more common goal now
1574680	1579080	and working on kind of the visibility of the same radio station.
1579080	1580080	It's going to be a good thing.
1580080	1581080	All right.
1581080	1582080	I'll shut up.
1582080	1583080	I'll stop talking about it.
1583080	1584080	We're beating this topic into the ground.
1584080	1585640	Let's get into tonight's gaming news.
1585640	1586640	Loki.
1586640	1592320	Speaking of beating stuff into the ground, Activision's Guitar Hero Aerosmith has announced
1592320	1598580	its first few tracks that will be available for, I guess, fans of Aerosmith.
1598580	1606480	Of course, included in these are Make It, Uncle Salty, Draw the Line, No Surprise, and
1606480	1610080	Sweet Emotion.
1610080	1611080	That's kind of neat.
1611080	1614840	There's going to be, I guess, 40 plus songs in the game.
1614840	1619760	Sixty percent of it, of course, I guess, will be devoted to Aerosmith.
1619760	1624560	In fact, actually, I saw the way they kind of have it set up is neat.
1624560	1630240	You're going to be doing different sets, I guess, follow their career a little bit.
1630240	1634620	They'll have two songs that are openers that are from a different band, and then they'll
1634620	1637880	have three Aerosmith songs, maybe a bonus song or something like that, and they're going
1637880	1641400	to have different sets set up like that.
1641400	1645240	As long as it's better than Guitar Hero Rocks the 80s, right?
1645240	1647720	I think it will be.
1647720	1648720	What do you think?
1648720	1651980	What do you think is the sellability of a game like this that really focuses on one
1651980	1652980	band?
1652980	1656120	I know, yeah, they might have songs from other bands in it, like I heard they're going to
1656120	1664240	have Lenny Kravitz and people that have worked with Aerosmith, but Aerosmith's name is on
1664240	1665240	the cover.
1665240	1666240	It's Steve Tyler's lips.
1666240	1668800	Yes, and those big old lips are on the cover.
1668800	1671160	Is that going to be enough, do you think, to sell this game?
1671160	1673400	Maybe, but here's the thing.
1673400	1677100	I would just, the easiest way to decide if you want this game or not, just wait until
1677100	1685960	they get down to the point where they announce the entire soundtrack to the game.
1685960	1688720	My guess is they're not going to have download content for this game.
1688720	1693100	It's probably just going to be these songs and that's it, because why would they cut
1693100	1697020	into their Guitar Hero 3 download content, which of course is still going to be going
1697020	1702600	on until Guitar Hero 4 comes out.
1702600	1706880	If it's just something that sounds like you may like, if you're a fan of Aerosmith, great.
1706880	1708720	It's more power to you.
1708720	1714040	If you hate Aerosmith, you probably won't buy this game.
1714040	1716960	I think we can all be in agreement.
1716960	1722220	A lot of these music games are really starting to melt, get to the point of getting sick
1722220	1723220	of this.
1723220	1727400	In fact, we'll be getting to some other stuff later, like Sing Star.
1727400	1731300	I'm thinking part of the reason that makes this so alluring is that it looks like they're
1731300	1734220	just using the same damn engine from Guitar Hero 3.
1734220	1735280	It's updated a little bit.
1735280	1737520	The engine itself is actually upgraded a bit.
1737520	1739000	Define a little bit.
1739000	1743840	The graphics are a little bit better, animations are recaptured and they're a lot smoother.
1743840	1744840	Stuff like that.
1744840	1748080	But yeah, it's basically Guitar Hero 3.
1748080	1753400	Gerardimo in chat, chat.orangewellandshare.com, suggests Guitar Hero ABBA mix.
1753400	1754400	I'd be down with that.
1754400	1756760	But do they use any real guitar?
1756760	1761600	No, but you know, they have an opening for a drummer, so they might be Drum Hero.
1761600	1762600	No, I have to laugh though.
1762600	1763600	You're going to love this.
1763600	1767760	Well, I have to laugh because on the trailer, you know how they have all the little logos
1767760	1772920	of the different people that have products in the game and stuff like that, and Gibson
1772920	1773920	was on there?
1773920	1775480	I'm like, oh, that's funny.
1775480	1777480	Oh, the irony.
1777480	1778480	Ironic.
1778480	1780400	Very ironic.
1780400	1781400	It's like Ray-Ain.
1781400	1788540	Well, we'll hear more about Guitar Hero Aerosmith in the future, I'm sure, as we get closer
1788540	1789540	to the release date.
1789540	1797000	Another game we're hearing more and more about is Ninja Gaiden 2, which looks bloody fantastic.
1797000	1798000	Emphasis on bloody.
1798000	1800000	It looks wonderful.
1800000	1805420	Ninja Gaiden 2, if you want to see all that blood, the demo is going to be coming in May.
1805420	1809420	May is going to be the delivery of the Ninja Gaiden 2 demo.
1809420	1812840	That is according to Microsoft's Ninja Gaiden 2 website.
1812840	1817880	And apparently, there's also supposed to be some exclusive content beginning on April
1817880	1818880	15th.
1818880	1823360	But if it's anything like previous exclusive content, it's probably crappy gamer picks
1823360	1827200	and crappy themes, and maybe some cool-looking trailers.
1827200	1830960	But I wouldn't expect that there's going to be like, you know, a pre-demo.
1830960	1832840	I mean, I don't think you can have it.
1832840	1835680	So I'm pretty sure it's just gamer picks and stuff.
1835680	1839940	The game, by the way, comes out on June 3rd, and I think there's a lot of folks that are
1839940	1840940	very excited about it.
1840940	1841940	Ninja Gaiden Hi-Rez.
1841940	1848880	I miss, what was her name from Ninja, Irene.
1848880	1851320	I miss her from the original game.
1851320	1853760	Remember the CIA agent or whatever she was?
1853760	1856680	Those cutscenes were so frickin' epic back then in the NES days.
1856680	1858780	Now you expect cutscenes in your games.
1858780	1860800	Back then, epic.
1860800	1862800	Just epic.
1862800	1869080	Well, one thing that we've talked about on the show before is the Penny Arcade game that's
1869080	1875600	supposed to be, well, an episodic series, Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice
1875600	1877600	of Darkness.
1877600	1885200	There is a price out for it now, $19.95, which would be about half that numeric value in
1885200	1890880	pounds for our UK listeners, and that's just for the Windows, Mac, and Linux version of
1890880	1891880	the game.
1891880	1895000	It's going to be released on Linux, that's cool.
1895000	1899720	There is an Xbox Live Arcade version that will have a simultaneous launch, no price
1899720	1900720	released yet.
1900720	1906360	Five to ten hours of playing for you, so that's pretty cool.
1906360	1908120	Ninja Gaiden No, it's weird.
1908120	1913880	I thought that they were saying that the, I want to say that the Xbox Live Arcade version
1913880	1921780	was going to be $20, which I thought was kind of surprising, seeing as they haven't really
1921780	1923720	had a game that would spend $20.
1923720	1929560	I think the most was like Luminous with $15 and stuff, but $20 for that game is really
1929560	1930560	expensive.
1930560	1932760	Penny Arcade It is a little steep.
1932760	1936040	Ninja Gaiden This game better be epic as well, for $20.
1936040	1937800	Penny Arcade I'm going to pay that much money, I'll just
1937800	1938800	get it on Windows.
1938800	1942000	Ninja Gaiden But, yeah, I was going to say, you know, $20
1942000	1946400	is kind of the average of your $19.95 is what you pay for a low budget Windows game, so
1946400	1948920	is it really that obscene of a price on Xbox Live?
1948920	1952460	Not really, you know, but as long as the game is quality, that's what's important.
1952460	1958100	You know it has a great tie-in, you know, I don't know a lot of gamers who don't love
1958100	1963020	Penny Arcade, or at least like and respect it a lot, so you know it's going to be at
1963020	1966840	least the quality there, it's just the question of, but will it be, it's kind of like that
1966840	1968440	question, will it blend?
1968440	1970440	Will it blend into a game?
1970440	1971440	We'll see.
1971440	1974760	Ninja Gaiden Yeah, now a game that we're probably not
1974760	1981560	going to get over here, unfortunately, Raiden Fighters Aces has gotten a demo on the Japanese
1981560	1987560	Xbox Live, of course I think some of us who have Xbox Live accounts in Japan might be
1987560	1990680	able to download that, I haven't tried it yet though.
1990680	1996360	Now Raiden Fighters Aces is, I believe, just a collection of the three Raiden Fighters
1996360	2004400	games, of course Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, Operation Helldive, and Raiden Fighters
2004400	2014240	Jet, or actually all three of those from the late 90s, and great top-down shooter games.
2014240	2020240	You know, there was, back in the day on the Playstation, there was just, for the first
2020240	2025840	two Raiden games, you know before these came out, there was a compilation on there, I would
2025840	2028560	like to see one that's all of them.
2028560	2031560	That would be a big compilation.
2031560	2033520	That would be a very big compilation.
2033520	2034640	That would be epic.
2034640	2037120	You know what that compilation's called?
2037120	2038120	MAME.
2038120	2044840	Actually, the boards for the first three Raiden games have been intensely difficult for them
2044840	2045840	to crack.
2045840	2050480	I think that they've only gotten, they haven't, as far as I know they haven't cracked Raiden
2050480	2051480	DX yet.
2051480	2054480	That game was fun, we had that at our round table.
2054480	2059120	I like the electric one that latches on and does the swirly bit.
2059120	2061120	That was my favorite one.
2061120	2062120	Yeah.
2062120	2063760	Very cool.
2063760	2070400	Alright, well, talking about games coming from Japan and shooter games, you know, I
2070400	2074360	guess somebody out there was just thinking to themselves, like, you know, we don't have
2074360	2076520	enough shoot-em-up games on Xbox Live.
2076520	2077520	We really don't.
2077520	2079520	We need more.
2079520	2083920	And luckily, though, one of the granddaddies of shoot-em-up games is on its way to Xbox
2083920	2084920	Live Arcade.
2084920	2085920	It's Ikaruga.
2085920	2088280	So I guess we can make room for that.
2088280	2090120	We can find room in there somewhere.
2090120	2094080	And of course, we've been having rumors about this game for a couple weeks now, and the
2094080	2099600	latest one, I think last week we had the month nailed down as April, well, this week, thanks
2099600	2106040	to the Japan's version of Xbox.com, we now know that the release date is set to be April
2106040	2107040	9th.
2107040	2110880	Now, of course, all these types of things are always subject to change, and who knows,
2110880	2115400	the Japanese website could have been wrong, but, you know, it does look pretty likely
2115400	2119280	it's going to be out in early April rather than later, which isn't a bad thing because
2119280	2120280	Ikaruga is pretty awesome.
2120280	2122600	It is pretty awesome.
2122600	2125240	So I guess we can make room for one more shooter if it's Ikaruga.
2125240	2126680	You know what?
2126680	2128320	You know what I would rather see than Ikaruga?
2128320	2129320	What?
2129320	2130520	Radiant Silver Gun.
2130520	2131520	You never know.
2131520	2133520	I wish.
2133520	2144560	Well, in other news as far as games to be out, and this is actually more of a leak from
2144560	2153400	the ESRB, and this would be also for Xbox Live, Darwinia is supposed to be coming out
2153400	2155400	and it actually was confirmed.
2155400	2161440	It's actually listed as Darwinia Plus, Survival of the Flat, or, which is, okay, from what
2161440	2168780	I'm understanding on here, it's a multiplayer version, Multiwinia, Survival of the Flattest,
2168780	2170160	so it's fairly interesting.
2170160	2173600	We've had a lot of people tell us about this game that it's supposed to be really good,
2173600	2180120	but there's actually a demo out for Windows, Mac, and Linux right now.
2180120	2185200	Quel Tipo in chat says, screw Darwinia, I want Darwin awards the game.
2185200	2188240	Isn't that just pain on PlayStation Network?
2188240	2189240	I'm not sure.
2189240	2191000	That sounds sort of like it.
2191000	2195040	But no, Darwinia, I've heard nothing but good things about Darwinia, so it's kind of neat
2195040	2200640	that these little games are getting this more massive distribution, and I'm assuming from
2200640	2204960	the whole Plus in the name, there's going to be a lot of extra futures, which probably
2204960	2210200	will be justifying the cost of it on Xbox Live, but I look forward to an easy way to
2210200	2211200	check it out.
2211200	2218480	Well, if anyone wants to check out the demo, go to introversion.co.uk slash Darwinia, and
2218480	2221480	you can download the demo there.
2221480	2222480	Very cool.
2222480	2227400	Another game we can look forward to around Christmas this year, of course, for whatever
2227400	2231880	reason, Microsoft likes to release at least one family game around that time.
2231880	2238640	This year, instead of, and I can only hope that's instead of, Viva Pinata and Viva Pinata
2238640	2247520	Party Animals, and probably another Viva Pinata sequel, we get Banjo Kazooie 3, and to be
2247520	2249920	honest, I had never played the original game.
2249920	2252840	It's a headache.
2252840	2257560	No interest from me whatsoever, but hey, I know a lot of people liked it.
2257560	2262280	I played it once, and I know it has a rabid fan base because of its quirky sense of humor.
2262280	2263280	Yes.
2263280	2269860	If you're looking forward to it, I would say you're probably going to see it in November.
2269860	2272480	How highly anticipated do you think this game is?
2272480	2274920	One thing I also know about Banjo Kazooie is that it's been a long time since there's
2274920	2276420	been a game in this series.
2276420	2282720	They teased it at E3 last year, but that's probably the last we've heard of it.
2282720	2283720	I don't know.
2283720	2284720	It'll be neat.
2284720	2290640	I mean, they need some good family games, I guess, because Viva Pinata's not that great.
2290640	2291640	No offense.
2291640	2292640	No, no, no.
2292640	2293640	There's people that love Viva Pinata.
2293640	2297960	I think the wrong people that Microsoft thought were going to get into Viva Pinata got into
2297960	2298960	Viva Pinata.
2298960	2299960	Here's the thing.
2299960	2305200	They should take a note from it that they need a good sim game on the Xbox 360, okay?
2305200	2312600	Then what they should do, though, Viva Pinata, though, it's not like your traditional platform
2312600	2313600	gamer game.
2313600	2316960	I think that's going to appeal to a lot of people because they like their Marios and
2316960	2317960	stuff like that.
2317960	2322760	But I think Banjo Kazooie is going to have kind of the same effect as Ratchet and Clank
2322760	2324380	and that kind of stuff.
2324380	2328520	Maybe not so popular, but it'll still be pretty decent.
2328520	2332200	Hopefully decent enough for Banjo Kazooie 4 for fans of the series.
2332200	2335260	So we'll see.
2335260	2338240	Gold Banjo in chat says Banjo Kazooie is awesome.
2338240	2339960	That's what my screen name is named after.
2339960	2345020	So if you want to know where the Banjo in Gold Banjo comes from, there it is.
2345020	2346020	I was not aware of that.
2346020	2347440	I was not either, but now I know.
2347440	2348440	The more you know.
2348440	2349440	All right.
2349440	2350440	I know it's half the battle.
2350440	2351440	Something else you should be aware of.
2351440	2357220	If you are cheating on Xbox Live, you're about to get spanked by Microsoft because you've
2357220	2360100	been very, very naughty.
2360100	2364400	Here's the deal is that Microsoft has been going through and finding people who have
2364400	2370880	been cheating in games doing save game hacks and how do people cheat their game or score?
2370880	2371880	Loki, you ought to know this stuff.
2371880	2373120	Why would I know this stuff?
2373120	2375240	Just because I know you would know this stuff.
2375240	2380900	Well, apparently there's some workarounds that they can actually do where it hacks their
2380900	2384720	actual profile that you don't even need to play the game to get the achievement points
2384720	2385720	from.
2385720	2386720	Wow.
2386720	2388840	That's what they're really cracking down on is stuff like that.
2388840	2389840	Interesting.
2389840	2390840	Well.
2390840	2393080	Because you can't do the save stuff anymore.
2393080	2397820	They have that stupid digital rights management thing that they threw in there to fuck everybody
2397820	2400440	over with everything.
2400440	2404440	That stopped people from save swapping and stuff like that.
2404440	2410640	And not all the games worked with save swapping, so it was very unreliable stuff.
2410640	2415400	Well, here's the thing is that now for these people, their score is getting zapped to zero.
2415400	2418680	Their gamer score is getting completely erased, gone.
2418680	2423360	And if you look at their profile on Xbox.com, there's a big old little question mark on
2423360	2426960	their profile and it says, what happened to their gamer score?
2426960	2428920	They've been caught cheating.
2428920	2432800	So now these folks basically get the scarlet question mark, or it's more of the orange
2432800	2435680	question mark on their profile that labels them as a cheater.
2435680	2441000	I can't wait because I'm not too optimistic on Microsoft and picking people that cheat.
2441000	2443800	And I have a feeling they're going to make some mistakes in there and they're going to
2443800	2447860	pick people that did not cheat and they're going to mark them as cheaters and that's going
2447860	2449120	to have a whole backlash thing.
2449120	2452880	I mean, I would just ban these people from Xbox Live.
2452880	2453880	Why aren't they just doing that?
2453880	2455240	Because they seem to do that with everything else.
2455240	2457200	I don't understand why they just have to...
2457200	2458480	Making examples of them.
2458480	2459520	Well, that's fine.
2459520	2464040	I have no problem with them making examples of them, but I have a feeling that they're
2464040	2466940	going to get some people that really didn't cheat.
2466940	2468960	Why's it got to be an orange question mark?
2468960	2469960	What's wrong with orange?
2469960	2471480	You got a problem with orange, Microsoft?
2471480	2473480	Why's it got to be an orange question mark?
2473480	2474480	Jerks.
2474480	2475920	Well, it's kind of a gold orange.
2475920	2476920	Shut up.
2476920	2483440	But, no, I don't think at the same time Microsoft is like running rampant accusing everybody
2483440	2484440	of being a witch.
2484440	2485440	You know?
2485440	2486440	Witch!
2486440	2487440	Cheetah!
2487440	2488440	Burn the cheetah!
2488440	2489440	We found a witch.
2489440	2490440	May we burn her?
2490440	2495520	I don't think Microsoft is running through the village accusing everybody of being a
2495520	2496520	witch.
2496520	2501720	I think they just targeted some of the high profile people like Strip Club GJ.
2501720	2503120	You know, that guy.
2503120	2507720	And I just know him because he actually messaged me once because I got DDR universe the day
2507720	2512640	it came out and I was playing it all day long and I had like 500 gamer score and I must
2512640	2515920	have had one of the higher gamer scores I had had anybody that day because he messaged
2515920	2517880	me and he was like, how was the game?
2517880	2518880	Is it good?
2518880	2520560	Is it easy to get the gamer score?
2520560	2524320	So I remember him because I laughed my ass off when I saw I was getting this message
2524320	2527840	from him and I heard he was one of the people that got caught with this and sure enough,
2527840	2528840	yes he is.
2528840	2529840	Oh, he was?
2529840	2530840	Yes, he was.
2530840	2536320	And he's got the profile on Xbox.com and he's got the, he's a witch, witch, witch, witch,
2536320	2537320	burn him!
2537320	2540960	I almost have 10,000 gamer points.
2540960	2543880	No thanks to my friend playing Rock Band for me.
2543880	2547720	But that's not cheating in the sense of Microsoft cheating.
2547720	2549720	Sairan says, how do you know it's a cheater?
2549720	2550720	It looks like one!
2550720	2552720	They turned me into a Yaris.
2552720	2557560	Turned me into a- I got better.
2557560	2561440	Trip Club DJ made me play Yaris.
2561440	2564360	That's punch like that.
2564360	2565360	Burn him!
2565360	2567000	How do you know they're a cheater?
2567000	2568000	Build a game out of them!
2568000	2571900	Let's just hope it doesn't become a witch hunt but Microsoft's been pretty good about
2571900	2575600	covering their ass because they're saying like, you know, what if somebody calls them
2575600	2577360	and said my brother did it?
2577360	2579400	Then Microsoft already has it out there.
2579400	2581280	Too bad because it's in the terms of agreement.
2581280	2583680	You're not supposed to share your gamertag with other people.
2583680	2584680	So nah, nah, nah, nah.
2584680	2588480	What if you didn't share it but they didn't put any sort of password protection on the
2588480	2592480	account and when you weren't there, someone used your account and cheated.
2592480	2593480	Witch!
2593480	2599160	Because you're a witch and you share your account, evil witch.
2599160	2601600	Well it's just like- Not all witches are evil!
2601600	2606480	Just like if your thing read rings or whatever and you happen to have plugged it into a surge
2606480	2607480	protector.
2607480	2609040	You're like, oh see, that's why.
2609040	2611520	That's why our graphics chip fucked up.
2611520	2614200	It's because you plugged it in a surge protector.
2614200	2615200	That's true.
2615200	2617080	We wouldn't want to forget about Glenda the Good Witch.
2617080	2618080	No.
2618080	2619080	I know.
2619080	2621360	Nowadays, being a witch is religious.
2621360	2622760	I know, I know.
2622760	2623920	Witch is a very broad term.
2623920	2625400	You know what we're parodying here, Jamie.
2625400	2636120	It should be a Goomba hunt.
2636120	2637760	It should be a release date!
2637760	2639920	Yeah, how about that?
2639920	2643760	I got some release dates right here, okay?
2643760	2646560	Um, I have four.
2646560	2647880	And two of them are the same game.
2647880	2649640	Alright, what's that?
2649640	2656640	So, um, Baroque on the first for PS2 and Wii, and Condemned 2 Bloodshot on Xbox 360 and
2656640	2657640	PS3.
2657640	2658640	And that's it.
2658640	2662440	Now, how can she predict the future about all these games coming out in the UK?
2662440	2664240	It's because she's a witch!
2664240	2665240	No.
2665240	2666240	Witch!
2666240	2667800	No, it's because I have reliable sources.
2667800	2668800	Oh, okay.
2668800	2669800	So, no.
2669800	2670800	Reliable witch sources!
2670800	2675040	Alright, let the joke die, Jesus.
2675040	2677240	And lit some charcoal and read it in the smoke.
2677240	2681400	No, I want the witch hunt joke to die now before it gets too old.
2681400	2685040	Just watch, there's going to be a wiki on it now.
2685040	2687560	I love the OLR wiki more than anything.
2687560	2688560	It's so great.
2688560	2689560	Sorry.
2689560	2693560	Alright, uh, Loki, what's coming out in the US?
2693560	2696960	Not a whole lot of good stuff, unfortunately.
2696960	2705840	No, this time around we get some crap, including Rafa Nadal Tennis on the DS.
2705840	2709440	I think that came out already, but eh, whatever.
2709440	2713400	It's probably a GameStop exclusive, but that's okay, it sucks.
2713400	2717600	Octomania got delayed, I guess, a week or so.
2717600	2722280	That's now coming out on the Wii, $19.99 for a puzzle game, and it has online, so that's
2722280	2723280	not bad.
2723280	2726040	And it's Atlus, you gotta support Atlus.
2726040	2734360	And let's see, Mana Kima Alchemist of Aurovis, and that's a new Koei RPG for Playstation
2734360	2736420	2.
2736420	2742120	There's a game called Toy Shop, which is coming out on the DS, I guess it's like a sim toy
2742120	2744240	shop game.
2744240	2748520	And let's see here, Call of Duty 4 Game of the Year Edition, that's coming out on the
2748520	2749700	first as well.
2749700	2756080	That's just a re-release of Call of Duty 4 with the downloadable map pack, or token for
2756080	2757080	that.
2757080	2761080	So if you don't have it yet, that's probably the way you want to go.
2761080	2774520	And let's see here, there's also World Championship cards on the PSP, but that's pretty much it.
2774520	2777760	Let's head on over to Japan and look at the release dates over there, really nothing to
2777760	2780720	look forward to on Xbox 360, I'm sorry to say.
2780720	2787280	There is stuff on Playstation 3, if you like Eye of Judgment, you can get some of the expansions
2787280	2789520	over there, that's about it.
2789520	2794880	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, gosh, really not a lot there as well.
2794880	2799360	This is a very slow week in Japan as far as the next gen systems go.
2799360	2807160	Well on the Playstation 2 you get Pro Yaku Spirits 5 comes out, which is another baseball
2807160	2811160	simulator game, so there's that, I suppose, to look forward to.
2811160	2814440	And let's see if there's anything on the handhelds, surely there's got to be something on the
2814440	2815440	Nintendo DS.
2815440	2817320	No, there's really not.
2817320	2822640	Oh, on April 3rd there is some stuff coming out.
2822640	2831400	Let's see, there's One High Ten Fun de Igaju Zunikakuru DS, from Bondi comes a game called
2831400	2833400	Detective Conan.
2833400	2836120	That's an interesting and old school anime series.
2836120	2841100	There's a new game coming out there, and this game coming from a group called FonFon, is
2841100	2848160	the publisher for this one, Kuchan no Shiwashi Kantan Oriuri Recipe comes out, and it looks
2848160	2852240	like a cooking game, or it could be, I don't think it's cooking, I think this is actually
2852240	2853240	like a virtual cookbook.
2853240	2856560	It looks like it has like 300 recipes in a little virtual cookbook.
2856560	2860360	They were supposed to release something like that out here, but they never did.
2860360	2863320	Well you can import this one, except I hope you can read Japanese, or it's really not
2863320	2864760	going to do you a lot of good.
2864760	2868160	Well then you probably aren't going to be able to do it.
2868160	2869720	Anything on the PSP?
2869720	2874440	Yes, Star Ocean Second Evolution comes out on the Sony PSP from Squeenix.
2874440	2875440	That's pretty cool.
2875440	2878280	Yeah, so that would probably be one of the bigger releases in Japan this week, otherwise
2878280	2880640	you've got to really wait until next week.
2880640	2884540	Not a lot of big releases in Japan this week, I guess it's a slow week all around, but probably
2884540	2887800	because we're kind of in a little bit of a slow period until we get into like the summer
2887800	2891760	games, then we'll see a lot of stuff.
2891760	2896100	Out of curiosity real quick before we get into the next story, because summer games
2896100	2901800	reminded me, there's the Olympics this year, yet outside of Mario and Sonic at the Olympics,
2901800	2905920	I haven't heard of a lot of like Beijing video games.
2905920	2906920	What's up with that?
2906920	2909520	It seems like every year there's an Olympics, there's some horrible games.
2909520	2911320	Sega is putting out an Olympics game in June.
2911320	2912320	Is there?
2912320	2913320	Oh, okay.
2913320	2918200	Beijing Olympics, oh wait, so yeah, there is one coming.
2918200	2919200	Is it coming on the Wii?
2919200	2921720	PS3 and Xbox 360.
2921720	2922720	No Wii.
2922720	2926160	Oh, maybe they don't want it to interview with Mario and Sonic at the Olympics one.
2926160	2927160	Interesting.
2927160	2931560	I don't know about that, but there is one coming.
2931560	2932960	Interesting.
2932960	2937400	What are you giggling about over there, dare I ask?
2937400	2942840	I'm looking at the listener profiles on our wiki, and while still you tease is great.
2942840	2944640	Poor guy.
2944640	2945640	I know, I'm sorry.
2945640	2946760	Stop picking on him.
2946760	2954560	I didn't want to pick on him, but I just did not expect it, so I was like, okay.
2954560	2957100	Gerardimo said, Sky, why is that bad?
2957100	2962800	It's not necessarily bad, I'm just curious, and usually these Olympic games are fucking
2962800	2966960	horrible anyway, but I'm just curious, because I was surprised I haven't heard a lot about
2966960	2970320	tie-in games when the Beijing Olympics are kind of a big deal.
2970320	2971880	You want to hear something weird?
2971880	2972880	What's that?
2972880	2977480	That's a tough topic here, but next week there's a game, or not next week, but the week after
2977480	2980600	next there's a game on the DS coming out called Plushies.
2980600	2982480	That reminds me of like, Furries.
2982480	2983480	Oh no.
2983480	2985880	I want my ferret, Rob.
2985880	2986880	Let the jokes begin.
2986880	2988920	I want my ferret.
2988920	2989920	You want the ferret?
2989920	2990920	Yeah.
2990920	2994440	We might be able to make that happen, but not unless you read us more news.
2994440	2998520	I have some news.
2998520	3000760	Sony has said they're sorry.
3000760	3005760	We already knew they were sorry, but they've also apologized too.
3005760	3012060	They now have some updates to the PS3 store, and one of them is Gran Turismo 5 Prologue,
3012060	3021320	which for the UK is $24.99, with UEFA Euro 2008 demo and Unreal Tournament 3 for free,
3021320	3029960	and Turok Map Packs for $1.99, and the Eye of Judgment Bio-Rebellion card set for $6.99.
3029960	3039800	Also PS1 Reel Fishing has been added for $3.49 to PS3 and PSP stores.
3039800	3047280	Oh, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, give me.
3047280	3049280	Hi ferret.
3049280	3051880	It has a ferret now.
3051880	3053960	Yes, I found the damn ferret.
3053960	3055860	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
3055860	3059920	There's also trailers on the PS3 store for Everybody's Golf World Tour, Eye of Judgment,
3059920	3074720	GT5 Prologue, Dark Sector, and Dynasty Warriors 6, and Sony said, we sorry, poo, poo on us.
3074720	3077440	Somehow I don't think they phrased it quite like that.
3077440	3082200	To quote, as previously mentioned, we unfortunately experienced some last minute technical difficulties
3082200	3084960	and weren't able to publish the new content as planned.
3084960	3089160	However, we have been working hard to resolve these issues and are pleased to be able to
3089160	3093240	let you know that basically they're all live on the UK store.
3093240	3095880	Yeah, this is specific, by the way, to the UK store.
3095880	3102320	But hey, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue PAL is out, so if you want to play an extended demo,
3102320	3103320	go for it.
3103320	3109040	I was going to say also in the US, they made some announcements of upcoming stuff, not
3109040	3111180	necessarily anything coming out right away.
3111180	3115280	But late April, we're going to be getting the Pixel Junk Monsters Encore, which is an
3115280	3119520	expansion pack to, of course, Pixel Junk Monsters.
3119520	3126120	Early May, we're going to be getting Echo Chrome, and in May sometime, Elephunk.
3126120	3130160	And then late May, or early June, Wipeout HD.
3130160	3131160	So that's pretty cool.
3131160	3135040	They had some pretty interesting videos for Wipeout, some of them make a pack or something
3135040	3136040	that got released.
3136040	3142240	They had some really trippy, kind of like cartoony tracks, I don't know.
3142240	3148560	So definitely check those out if you own Wipeout Pulse on the PSP, it should be on the Playstation
3148560	3149560	store.
3149560	3151680	You can download those.
3151680	3153880	Okay.
3153880	3156440	Some other fun stuff, of course...
3156440	3157560	Hey, guess what?
3157560	3161400	Bobby said he didn't need to make one creative change to our show, and that is that no more
3161400	3162400	ferret.
3162400	3163400	Ferret, no.
3163400	3166840	The batteries are going to die in that thing.
3166840	3169560	You know that we've had that thing for as long as we've been doing this show?
3169560	3170560	It's mascot.
3170560	3172200	Those batteries are going to die someday.
3172200	3173880	The ferret is eternal.
3173880	3174880	No they won't.
3174880	3176880	You don't understand, Rob.
3176880	3180320	You can rip them open and put new batteries in, that's how I got those other ones to work.
3180320	3182840	Why do you have to fucking tell her how to do it?
3182840	3188400	Like seriously, you could smile and nod and say, yes, Rob, the ferret will die.
3188400	3192720	But no, you have to say, oh, we can give it a lobotomy.
3192720	3197760	There's almost a bald spot now from where I've been pressing it in the same spot.
3197760	3198760	That's ferret abuse.
3198760	3200960	I'm sorry, are we a video game podcast?
3200960	3206040	We're the food and ferret cast.
3206040	3211840	But then you had to mention Bobby and it, you know, halted the show.
3211840	3218080	Anyways, so Grand Theft Auto IV, of course they like to innovate with each new release
3218080	3219080	that they're coming out.
3219080	3220680	Now this is something very interesting.
3220680	3224760	What they're actually going to incorporate into Grand Theft Auto IV is real world music
3224760	3228900	downloads, and it's going to be tied in with Amazon.com.
3228900	3232920	Now the way this works is in the game, you can actually call an in-game service called
3232920	3239960	Zit on your mobile phone, and you get text messages with song and artist names, as well
3239960	3243880	as an email if you're a member of the Rockstar Social Club.
3243880	3250600	And then when you download tracks or whatever, they're going to be about 89 cents to 99 cents,
3250600	3254720	and they'll actually, of course they're DRM free because they're MP3s, but I guess you
3254720	3259860	can download them in-game and you also get them in the real world.
3259860	3269160	So that's pretty cool that you'll be able to download some music.
3269160	3273080	Somebody by the nickname of Beatmania Slot Machine in our chat room says, Orange Ferret
3273080	3274080	Fudio.
3274080	3277240	Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood this a little bit.
3277240	3282340	It's actually, okay, the way this works is the soundtrack for the game, so the music
3282340	3287760	actually inside the game, not additional music, so if you hear a song you like on the radio
3287760	3292400	or something like that, you can dial that service in the game and then get the MP3 sent
3292400	3293400	to you.
3293400	3295840	I do have to make a comment to Beatmania Slot Machine.
3295840	3296840	What's that?
3296840	3299300	It's actually not a slot machine, it's a Pachi slot.
3299300	3300520	But we'll get to that later.
3300520	3302920	Don't spoil the upcoming news stories.
3302920	3303920	Don't spoil them.
3303920	3304920	I'm just kidding.
3304920	3310760	But I assume since this is an Xbox 360 game and a PS3 game that you'll be able to put
3310760	3314640	your own music in there anyways, so that'd be cool.
3314640	3318400	Aren't they doing this in real cars, too, or at least I know there's that whole like
3318400	3322000	cell phone thing, like isn't there a commercial on TV for like Verizon or something where
3322000	3326320	like you hold up your cell phone and it will recognize the song and download it for you
3326320	3327320	or something like that?
3327320	3328920	Yeah, there's stuff like that out there.
3328920	3332520	Of course they want people to have the big red button.
3332520	3333520	What is that?
3333520	3334520	Staples?
3334520	3336720	Is that the chain that has the commercials with the big easy button that you just press
3336720	3338240	it and it does things for you?
3338240	3343400	Of course retailers want that with your shopping, one button shopping, because how easy is it
3343400	3345560	to push a button to get something?
3345560	3349240	Because there's that whole mental thing of instant gratification, which is what this
3349240	3350920	whole society is about.
3350920	3355320	You're not physically taking the money out of your wallet and handing it to somebody
3355320	3356320	or your purse or whatever.
3356320	3358080	You're not handing it to somebody.
3358080	3362300	Therefore it's so much easier to make these stupid impulse buys.
3362300	3366320	And I think this whole feature, while it's interesting and kind of cool, I guess, for
3366320	3371320	a video game is kind of capitalizing on that, because you know there are going to be a lot
3371320	3374680	of people that buy this game and there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be
3374680	3378160	like, oh, I like this game, click, oh, I just spent a dollar.
3378160	3379160	But it's just a dollar.
3379160	3380560	That's what I hate about iTunes.
3380560	3382400	But I clicked 20 times.
3382400	3385080	Well, iTunes is almost the same type of thing.
3385080	3386080	That's what I was saying.
3386080	3389860	That's what I hate about iTunes, especially since it's on my damn phone.
3389860	3394280	But at the same time, I like iTunes, but it's a love-hate relationship.
3394280	3400920	I love iTunes, I love the way it organizes my music and everything, but I do find myself,
3400920	3405440	it's far too easy to just go, oh, it's just 99 cents for a song, 300 songs later, oh,
3405440	3406440	I'm broke.
3406440	3411280	I've gone how many years without buying a damn thing on iTunes until I got my phone?
3411280	3415800	And then I probably, I'm still okay, I probably only bought like 25 songs total.
3415800	3416840	It's that convenience.
3416840	3417840	I'm telling you.
3417840	3418840	We're such a lazy society.
3418840	3424320	I mean, it's not necessarily like, I'm not saying like, oh, you're bad or, you know,
3424320	3425320	oh, you're, but it's just kind of where we are.
3425320	3428640	I think it's more putting the temptation in there because honestly, and this is how me
3428640	3434160	personally I am, I believe that the things worth having are worth working for, you know.
3434160	3437360	It's like, it's like I'm putting a giant cookie, no, no, I got it.
3437360	3440160	I'm putting a giant piece of pastrami in your hands.
3440160	3443440	I'm not that big on pastrami.
3443440	3446080	I wanted pastrami today.
3446080	3447080	So I got pastrami.
3447080	3448080	Okay, finally.
3448080	3449080	Press button.
3449080	3450080	Get pastrami.
3450080	3451080	Fine.
3451080	3452080	Then I put a big bottle of Goldschlager in your hand.
3452080	3453080	I don't like Goldschlager.
3453080	3454080	And I say, well, God damn it.
3454080	3455080	What is something you like?
3455080	3456080	Here's what I want.
3456080	3457080	I like sushi.
3457080	3458080	Okay.
3458080	3459080	Sushi.
3459080	3462720	I put a big piece of sushi in your hand and I say, hold on to this for a little bit.
3462720	3467900	By the way, if you eat that, you can eat it, but it will cost you a couple bucks.
3467900	3468900	And you're going, gulp.
3468900	3471280	You're like, oh, it's just a couple bucks, gulp.
3471280	3474000	Look, here, hold this piece too.
3474000	3479360	It's like hotel rooms at more upscale, I mean, obviously they don't have it at Motel 6, but
3479360	3484040	the more upscale type motels, they'll have all the candy and shit sitting out right there
3484040	3485040	on the table.
3485040	3489120	And it's like, hey, if you open it, two bucks.
3489120	3490120	What a terrible thing if you brought kids on the trip.
3490120	3491120	It's a freaking minibar.
3491120	3492120	So you know what I do?
3492120	3493120	Mm-hmm.
3493120	3495040	I go grocery store down the street and buy me a bottle.
3495040	3496040	That's what you got to do.
3496040	3497040	All right.
3497040	3498040	Sorry.
3498040	3499040	Tangent.
3499040	3500220	What are we without our tangents?
3500220	3501220	That's right.
3501220	3507400	I was just going to say, I want a service on Xbox Live where I can pay for a pizza with
3507400	3509480	Microsoft points.
3509480	3510480	Slash pizza?
3510480	3511480	Yeah.
3511480	3514200	But why shouldn't I be able to get one?
3514200	3515200	Wait.
3515200	3518400	I bet that type of stuff is only a matter of time away.
3518400	3519400	Only a matter of time.
3519400	3523760	I want to be able to stop, pause my game for a second, order pizza.
3523760	3528060	I guess I could just call up a pizza place and play the game at the same time, but we're
3528060	3531020	talking about integration, so why not?
3531020	3533860	But once you get sick of pizza, I mean...
3533860	3534860	I worked at a pizza place.
3534860	3535860	No, I don't get sick of pizza.
3535860	3540120	This is why I love internet TV, you know, because me and every...
3540120	3544040	I've made it perfectly clear, I hate being a slave to my television.
3544040	3545880	I hate having to...
3545880	3550760	And you know, I don't see any money of paying for a DVR when I can just go online and watch
3550760	3551760	whatever.
3551760	3553360	You want to hear something that's going to be really bad?
3553360	3557280	Wait till Spore comes out and they have that service where you can create your character
3557280	3559320	and then get a figurine of it.
3559320	3565280	Like, oh my god, that looks awesome, figurine, figurine, figurine, and they deliver this
3565280	3567720	giant crate of figures for your house.
3567720	3572260	Nope, I actually would do that, but then again, I also go back and have drawn fan art of my
3572260	3574520	PSO character in the past, so...
3574520	3578320	I'll do it too, and I like crappy things made by me, that's why.
3578320	3583200	Hey everybody, pay me 20 bucks and I'll draw your RPG character.
3583200	3588000	Did you have another thought you were trying to finish, Jamie, I'm sorry.
3588000	3589000	Dot dot dot.
3589000	3596120	I love this comment from rawstealut in regards to the pizza being sold on Xbox Live Marketplace,
3596120	3599520	but then the pizza would be DRM protected and you'd not be able to eat it if something
3599520	3600520	went wrong before it got delivered.
3600520	3601520	I remember what I was saying.
3601520	3602520	Okay.
3602520	3608560	What I was saying is that, you know, as long as you have a computer near you, anything
3608560	3612200	is convenient, because like I was saying, I don't watch TV, but I'll watch whatever
3612200	3617760	I can on the internet and do all of my other stuff, and I've ordered stuff through online
3617760	3623240	services before, you know, like, you know, if we were going to order from, like, say
3623240	3627000	if Dan and I wanted pizza, you can order online at some places while I'm doing plenty of other
3627000	3628000	things.
3628000	3633360	So, I mean, really, this whole society is about nothing but convenience, and I'm like,
3633360	3635440	dude, just go out and get it.
3635440	3636440	Better yet.
3636440	3639460	You order, like, Pizza Hut or something like that, because they're kind of affiliated with,
3639460	3644040	I know, I know, I prefer Roundtable, but that's regional, and, you know, Pizza Hut, they did
3644040	3648760	the whole affiliation with, you know, Xbox and stuff like that.
3648760	3654320	So, you order, like, a Pizza Hut pizza, and they have a card from Microsoft Points taped
3654320	3658040	to the top of the box, and that'd be cool, like, you know, 500 points or something like
3658040	3660520	that.
3660520	3661960	That would give me the order more Pizza Hut.
3661960	3662960	We'll see.
3662960	3664940	RawsteelUT says, why stop at pizza?
3664940	3667680	Order sushi, Chinese, and hamburgers.
3667680	3671360	Or even better, you order the past day and you get a downloadable content or something
3671360	3676640	like that for Grand Theft Auto, where you can actually have, you know, your Pizza Hut
3676640	3680680	outfit for your character, and you get a pizza in-game.
3680680	3681680	That's integration.
3681680	3683520	They need to hire us as marketing consultants.
3683520	3687560	I want to bring a soundboard with us to all games.
3687560	3688560	What do you think?
3688560	3689560	You think Bobby would love that?
3689560	3690960	If we take a soundboard with us to all games?
3690960	3691960	That would be fantastic.
3691960	3694880	And hey, Geronimo, Papa John's got me through college.
3694880	3698200	I think we need an actual soundboard first, you know.
3698200	3700200	We'll work on it.
3700200	3705560	I just don't want to go crazy with it because, you know, I don't want to go crazy with a
3705560	3707720	soundboard, but sometimes it's just too good.
3707720	3708720	All right.
3708720	3709720	Anyhow, sorry.
3709720	3710720	Back to video gaming news.
3710720	3713800	Well, actually, I wouldn't say this is gaming news, Morris.
3713800	3715200	It is gaming rumor.
3715200	3717480	That is big, big rumor.
3717480	3721520	Apparently the achievements for Grand Theft Auto IV have hit the internet.
3721520	3725640	Two different websites have posted the 50 different achievements that are supposed to
3725640	3727500	be in the game.
3727500	3732280	Some of the achievements are supposed to include things like hidden packages, doing types of
3732280	3737080	stunt jumping, completing certain missions, beating mini games.
3737080	3739720	Some of the other features, though, are a little weird.
3739720	3742920	Here's some sample achievements.
3742920	3745460	Manhunt will get you a 15 gamer score.
3745460	3749960	Complete the most wanted side missions from the police computer.
3749960	3754840	Warm Coffee, successfully date a girl to be invited into her house.
3754840	3762040	That's true, that's a pretty bold achievement, Warm Coffee.
3762040	3765960	Let Sleeping Rockstars Lie, 10 gamer score.
3765960	3769480	Kill a rockstar developer in a ranked multiplayer match.
3769480	3770480	I can see that.
3770480	3774320	There's just been a couple games that have things like that, Kill the Creator or something
3774320	3775320	like that.
3775320	3776320	That would be sweet.
3776320	3777320	I don't know.
3777320	3778840	I mean, like, they kind of sound legitimate, but she...
3778840	3779840	I think it's legit.
3779840	3787320	The gamer, you know, the profile that they show the gamer score for is one of the rockstar
3787320	3793160	internal gamer tags or whatever like that, so I'd buy it.
3793160	3798040	And it sounds legit, and I think that something by now would be leaked out, and who cares?
3798040	3799040	It's just gamer score.
3799040	3800880	It's not like it's spoiling the game or anything.
3800880	3801880	True.
3801880	3803920	Although they had some interesting things in there, like you can play pool, there's
3803920	3808440	an arcade game that's built into it, and you can bowl, so...
3808440	3813080	I kind of knew a lot of that stuff was coming, though, because Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice
3813080	3814080	City had a lot of that.
3814080	3816440	I think it's going to be awesome, and when this game comes out, I'll just have to become
3816440	3818160	a hermit for a while, so...
3818160	3821440	Nice knowing you.
3821440	3830000	Well, a lot of people have been waiting for the Gran Turismo 5 prologue, but they're going
3830000	3833760	to have to wait even longer for the actual thing, because they're saying it's still
3833760	3836200	about a year away.
3836200	3843840	So, if you want any type of Gran Turismo 5 at all, your best bet is to get the glorified
3843840	3845360	demo on April 17th.
3845360	3849600	My problem with the fact that this game's a year away is, assuming that they're using
3849600	3854200	the same engine, and I hope to God that they're not by the time we get around to that, it's
3854200	3855480	going to be so outdated.
3855480	3860680	By that time, you're going to have like, Forza 3, and so many other games that do what they
3860680	3863040	do a lot better.
3863040	3866840	I don't know, it's just kind of like, not worth it at this point.
3866840	3872680	Why does it take them so long to model cars when, you know, fucking Project Gotham and
3872680	3876840	all these other games, you know, have cars that look good as well, and they're well modeled?
3876840	3880160	I don't understand what's taking them so long to get this game done.
3880160	3883200	It's like everyone seems to be doing it a lot faster.
3883200	3887180	That's a quilt Hippo asks in chat, he says, why the hell do these Gran Turismo games take
3887180	3888180	so damn long?
3888180	3890080	Does it take that long to sample engine noises?
3890080	3894520	I mean, the game looks good, don't get me wrong, but it's just, it's not that much better
3894520	3900200	than like, Project Gotham or Forza, I mean, or even there's like Grid coming up that looks
3900200	3902360	pretty awesome.
3902360	3906520	I just, I don't see what, you know, they're putting a lot of time in it, you know, it's
3906520	3911700	kind of like Duke Nukem Forever type, I mean, not so bad, but, you know, Duke Nukem Forever,
3911700	3915000	they're putting all this effort and time into it, and then by the time it comes out, it's
3915000	3920480	just going to be kind of, it'll be good, but it won't be like, whoa, awesome, you know,
3920480	3927320	I just, you know, Gran Turismo 5 I'm sure will be really big for PlayStation, but will
3927320	3929200	it really be that big of an achievement?
3929200	3932560	I mean, I don't know.
3932560	3937840	I just don't understand why it's taking them so long for this game when, you know, Microsoft
3937840	3943240	and other companies can push out these games really quick, is my thing.
3943240	3949720	Well, it's just kind of, I don't know, I hope it's worth the wait for the fans of the series.
3949720	3951640	I really hope it is.
3951640	3958320	So there's an interesting rumors going around by, about a possible redesign and the newer
3958320	3960200	PSP.
3960200	3965720	Of course, you may remember the original PSP, which is known as the 1000 series, and the
3965720	3969280	newer PSP Slim, which is the 2000 series.
3969280	3975840	Well, apparently there is a third design in the works, and actually as part of an online
3975840	3985160	document for, you know, PlayStation.net, they actually have an image for the 3000 series.
3985160	3991680	So apparently it does exist, or it will be coming, so there will be yet maybe another
3991680	3997380	redesign to the PlayStation portable console, and I mean, after all, they were talking that
3997380	4004120	it was going to be a 10 year life cycle for this portable system, so I can see them making
4004120	4008120	some more revisions, but I think it's kind of interesting.
4008120	4011120	Kind of sucks for people that bought, you know, the Slim and the original and stuff
4011120	4012120	like that.
4012120	4014120	Now they have to buy a third one.
4014120	4017840	Seriously, this news alone is making me contemplate not getting, because I was thinking about
4017840	4021260	getting the Slim just because I wanted the video out, and you know, my PSP is getting
4021260	4023640	kind of old, and I kind of wanted to get a newer one.
4023640	4027120	They're coming down a lot in price, but now that I'm like, oh, there's another one that's
4027120	4030760	going to come out, I'm kind of like, well, maybe I ought to wait.
4030760	4035360	Remember some other company that did the exact same thing, the Gizmondo?
4035360	4038240	Remember how they're like, hey, you know what, we're going to have this system.
4038240	4041760	Oh, by the way, it hasn't released yet, but we're already doing a revision on it, and
4041760	4045520	you're like, eh, I'm just going to wait until the new one comes out, and then no one bought
4045520	4046520	it.
4046520	4050360	But, you know, I've got to wonder, like, you know, Nintendo kind of does the same thing.
4050360	4054680	Yes, but at the same time, I mean, here's the only difference between, I think, the
4054680	4058000	DS Lite and the PSP.
4058000	4062800	The PSP Slim, it limits you to what options you have available for you when you're playing
4062800	4063800	it.
4063800	4069280	Like, there's certain, you know, applications that you cannot use on, you know, the fatter
4069280	4074760	PSP, and also, the newer PSPs have more RAM and other stuff like that, whereas the DS
4074760	4075760	...
4075760	4076760	And shorter battery life.
4076760	4080280	No, the battery life is just the same, and actually, I think a little bit more improved,
4080280	4081720	but the fact is that...
4081720	4085360	Well, your friend's wrong.
4085360	4091120	Anyway, so they have, you know, the DS Lite, it basically is a bit slimmer and has, you
4091120	4094320	know, a brighter screen, but that's about it.
4094320	4101240	I mean, most things that run on the DS Lite will also run on the original DS as well.
4101240	4104800	There's not anything that says, okay, you have to have this, you know, version of the
4104800	4107960	hardware in order to be able to play this.
4107960	4108960	That's my only thing.
4108960	4112400	You know, there were three different versions of the Game Boy Advance.
4112400	4116440	There was that first one that wasn't backlit, there was the second one that came out that
4116440	4121840	was backlit, and then there was the real miniature one that could go on, like, your keychain.
4121840	4122840	So...
4122840	4123840	I have a micro.
4123840	4126720	Yeah, the Game Boy Advance, the SP, and the micro.
4126720	4127720	That's it.
4127720	4128720	The SP was ill, and then the micro, yeah.
4128720	4130320	The micro got me through many a line in E3.
4130320	4131960	The micro was such a waste of time.
4131960	4134360	But the micro didn't do very well overall, you know.
4134360	4135360	No, but I love it.
4135360	4137280	The only problem it sucked for is playing...
4137280	4140280	RPGs or anything with text?
4140280	4142520	Well, no, even text wasn't so bad.
4142520	4147520	It was playing any type of shooter.
4147520	4148520	I don't know.
4148520	4152360	I think it's, I guess it's, you know, inevitable that they're going to need to update the system
4152360	4156520	since you're not going to just come out with a PSP2 yet.
4156520	4160460	But I don't know, that kind of still sucks for someone that just bought the system.
4160460	4161460	But...
4161460	4163080	You should be used to it by now.
4163080	4168520	I'm sure this PSP 3000 will be unhackable, completely unhackable in any way.
4168520	4175840	All right, well let's move on to another Sony related story, and that has to do with a much
4175840	4179080	anticipated title, Metal Gear Solid 4.
4179080	4186080	The pre-order DVDs are shipping, and they come with that Metal Gear Online beta keys,
4186080	4190560	and it does announce that the beta is going to begin on April 21st.
4190560	4194720	You can download the Metal Gear Online beta on April 17th, so I guess they're giving a
4194720	4198680	little bit of time so that maybe the servers don't all get hammered at once, which probably
4198680	4199960	isn't a bad idea.
4199960	4205500	May 5th is when the beta runs until, so that actually isn't a whole lot of time, but...
4205500	4210240	I forgot, I downloaded, well I haven't quite downloaded it yet, but I'm in the Battlefield
4210240	4216000	Bad Company beta, which I hear wasn't very good, but I still haven't got a chance to
4216000	4217000	play it yet.
4217000	4221000	Hopefully next week I'll be able to talk about it a little bit, but that was another one
4221000	4222000	that was interesting.
4222000	4225400	I'll be very curious to hear from some of our listeners who are in on this.
4225400	4231000	I haven't ordered this because I don't really follow Metal Gear Online quite rapidly, but
4231000	4234360	I'd be really curious to hear from some of our fans on how this goes, how the online
4234360	4236080	beta is.
4236080	4240200	I'm sure there will be plenty of YouTubes and all that stuff, but I like to hear the
4240200	4242160	first-hand experiences.
4242160	4251200	Well, for our listeners in Europe, there actually may be an 80GB PlayStation 3 out by this summer.
4251200	4260880	Right now there's only the 40GB version, but there is a little bit of talk going around
4260880	4265560	that indicates there is going to be an 80GB model coming out.
4265560	4273080	So far Sony isn't really doing a good job at saying no about it, so maybe it is.
4273080	4276620	And there's actually no comment if it's going to even be backwards compatible or anything
4276620	4277620	else good.
4277620	4281620	I'm going to guess and say it probably will be as backwards compatible as the 80s over
4281620	4283180	here.
4283180	4286400	Now my question for Europe is, do you want it?
4286400	4289600	I mean, do you really want it?
4289600	4291880	Here would be my thing for Europe, okay?
4291880	4297040	They just announced that they're going to release the 80GB system there, and they're
4297040	4300640	kind of doing a new one for us with the Metal Gear Solid bundle, and I know the same thing
4300640	4307080	in Japan, but if you just wait a few more months, I will bet you anything in the fall
4307080	4312520	they will announce yet another SKU, so just like we were talking about before with the
4312520	4317580	PSP and stuff, just wait a little longer, because unless there's something you really
4317580	4321360	need to play right away, you can probably wait a few more months for the better games
4321360	4326200	to be coming out towards the falls, and by that time you can get probably a newer system
4326200	4334660	with better features for either the same price or less, so that would be my recommendation.
4334660	4340720	Another game you should definitely wait on buying is Eye of Judgment, and actually the
4340720	4346720	Eye of Judgment expansion has been having some delays coming to retail, and the reason
4346720	4356360	for this, Sony says, is transportation issues, so they were having some problem, I guess,
4356360	4361400	getting it from Wizards of the Coast to retailers.
4361400	4364800	Hear that, or someone hijacked the trucks?
4364800	4365800	Was that you?
4365800	4370780	Were you trying to get sales to not go up?
4370780	4372400	That wasn't me at all.
4372400	4378280	Actually it was, according to them, was it, the North American delay can be blamed on
4378280	4385720	transportation delays from European distributors of Eye of Judgment Byleth Rebellion 2 trading
4385720	4392280	cards, and they have yet to set a new launch date for the software and cards, but plan
4392280	4396400	to do so in the near future.
4396400	4400760	That's okay, everyone can buy the expansion because there's not a lot of people that own
4400760	4401760	the game.
4401760	4405160	I wonder if anyone at Wizards of the Coast has heard of the Loki bet.
4405160	4406480	Does anyone really care?
4406480	4409440	Sadly, yes, a lot of our listeners seem to care.
4409440	4410440	Well, they care.
4410440	4412440	I don't know what it is.
4412440	4415640	But Wizards of the Coast couldn't give a rat's ass.
4415640	4417720	Probably not.
4417720	4419040	Let's see.
4419040	4424240	Eye of Judgment plus Let's Ride Friends Forever equals Tingle, Cheeseburger's reminder that
4424240	4427280	we also get to count the sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever in the deck.
4427280	4429000	Yeah, all five of those.
4429000	4434040	All right, anyhow, one more story for you guys this segment before we get into the classic
4434040	4435040	game of the week.
4435040	4439200	And those of you guys that remember the good old days of OLR, you can appreciate this.
4439200	4441880	It's something that was alluded to a little bit earlier.
4441880	4448120	There is now a Pochi slot machine, which really kind of looks like a slot machine to me.
4448120	4451200	And oh, I was going to play the video for you guys, but it just got the SmackDown taken
4451200	4452200	off of YouTube.
4452200	4453200	I've got another one.
4453200	4456080	That's all right, don't worry about it.
4456080	4458000	Video doesn't do very good over the radio anyway.
4458000	4461600	But basically what happens, and I watched it earlier, it looked like a slot machine
4461600	4466480	to me, like one of those more like video slot machines you'd see in the casinos.
4466480	4469800	Basically with the slots coming down, when certain symbols come up, you play like a Beat
4469800	4477600	Mania bonus game, and you use the buttons on the thing to control Beat Mania.
4477600	4478600	And you know what?
4478600	4481320	Here's something else that's kind of cool.
4481320	4486240	That's not the only game that's gotten a slot version as well.
4486240	4487240	Well, what else?
4487240	4488240	Ridge Racer!
4488240	4491920	Yeah, that was also on Kotaku this week.
4491920	4493800	Did you get to control that?
4493800	4494800	I don't know.
4494800	4501360	But they should have like, you know, Kran eating Ken come out and yell, Ridge Racer!
4501360	4503040	There's also an Evangelion one.
4503040	4508880	Well, there are 11 different songs on 3 different difficulties, Easy, Medium, and Hard.
4508880	4513840	So it's certainly not as comprehensive as a new Beat Mania 2DX mix, but nevertheless
4513840	4519360	it is kind of interesting to see the world of Beat Mania and slot machines combined.
4519360	4523760	There's also a Parodius Apache slot that I think I've talked about before.
4523760	4525600	You ever play like slot machines that they have?
4525600	4527000	Because you don't really gamble, do you?
4527000	4528000	You don't really play slot machines.
4528000	4529880	I used to play that Fox Hunt one.
4529880	4530880	Fox Hunt?
4530880	4533460	That was at the place.
4533460	4537800	When I was in Reno last, the one I played a lot of was called the Frog Prince.
4537800	4541200	You know, and it's basically one where the bonus level is that you kiss different frogs
4541200	4544480	and you try to find the one that becomes a prince?
4544480	4548720	It was the dumbest game, but it was for some reason making me a lot of money that night.
4548720	4553760	Well, I was playing pennies, so it was making me a few dollars, which is a lot in pennies,
4553760	4555160	so that's why I stuck with it.
4555160	4559400	But I bring up slot machines and all that, because you know Konami makes a lot of slot
4559400	4560400	machines.
4560400	4562240	Even the ones you see over here, they make quite a few of those slot machines.
4562240	4564160	It's like another business of theirs we never really talk about.
4564160	4569040	So I see many of their franchises go into those slot machines and Apache slots.
4569040	4574720	I mean, honestly.
4574720	4577240	So how about we get into the Classic Game of the Week?
4577240	4578240	That sounds like a plan.
4578240	4582480	All right, you know what we do here at Orange Launch Radio at the end of Part A when our
4582480	4583880	show is winding down here?
4583880	4590560	We like to pay tribute and respect to gaming's classics, and DarkSakura likes to look through
4590560	4593780	her archive of games and pick a classic one for you every week.
4593780	4597840	We call it DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.
4597840	4600880	What classic game should the kids be playing this week, DarkSakura?
4600880	4604920	Well, this is actually one of my favorite RPGs ever, except honestly it's actually one
4604920	4611320	of the few that I've played quite a bit through in Japanese, until I had a little problem
4611320	4613320	playing through it.
4613320	4621400	The game is Grandia, which is one of the pinnacle, I would say, of Sega Saturn role-playing for
4621400	4625320	their RPG series.
4625320	4633640	So it did have quite a few sequels, one of them notably being Grandia 2 that was on Dreamcast
4633640	4638880	that I remember bringing up on the show years ago, because I thought it was cool that my
4638880	4643880	Japanese save file worked on the US version, because I put it in and I was like, where
4643880	4644880	am I?
4644880	4646960	I don't know what anybody's talking about.
4646960	4658760	So anyway, Grandia has 3D maps with 2D sprite characters, think like Ragnarok I guess, but
4658760	4664280	it rotates with your movement, it's from an angled third person perspective, and so it'll
4664280	4665280	follow with you.
4665280	4668960	Just a word of warning, the camera works so much better in the Saturn one, you also get
4668960	4675400	much more of the playfield open than you do with the Playstation one, which is, actually
4675400	4680800	the 3D looks better in the Saturn one, which is completely baffling to me, since the Saturn
4680800	4684560	didn't have that tremendous of a 3D processor.
4684560	4688640	You also have a compass to show you where you go, you get treasure chests inside.
4688640	4697320	A fun story to it too, you also have skill points that you need to learn your abilities,
4697320	4702360	and you have a rotational roster for your characters, you can pick different ones to
4702360	4707880	have in, there are different types of weapons and classes, like swords, maces, whips, that
4707880	4714120	sort of thing, and you actually learn your magic as you go through the game, by recovering
4714120	4718000	these mana eggs, it's pretty cool.
4718000	4722440	The combat system though is what I like best, Rob, you played Evolution, didn't you?
4722440	4723440	No.
4723440	4730280	I thought you did, well, Evolution is another game art title, but the way that the combat
4730280	4735560	works in here is that it's on, well you can, it's like in Chrono Trigger, you can see the
4735560	4741280	enemies on the screen, if they see you, they'll rush towards you, or you can try to avoid
4741280	4747520	them and they'll run into you, but then when you're in combat it goes overhead, and it
4747520	4756720	has, I look at it more of as initiative based, like if you were playing D&D or something,
4756720	4762240	then everybody has their own sort of speed that their initiative moves at, so you'll
4762240	4767000	have your slower characters taking longer, your faster ones being faster, and you choose
4767000	4773360	your attacks as you're going through, and then when that turn comes up, they'll hit
4773360	4777760	and then the enemy will go back and forth, it's pretty, I have to say it's fairly more
4777760	4782520	realistic than the turn based style for Final Fantasy games, if you know what I mean.
4782520	4784200	And Rob, you're watching it, what do you think?
4784200	4787920	It looks very interesting, I've always heard a lot about this game, it's just one of those
4787920	4791200	games I just never got around to playing, because there were a lot of games, especially
4791200	4795400	this was the period when I was in college, so I didn't play a lot of games, that was
4795400	4799600	kind of the one time in my life when I wasn't as into video games as I was the rest of it,
4799600	4804200	but it looks like a lot of fun, and I want to say, a sequel of Grandia's is available
4804200	4807040	on GameTap, I want to say, I want to say like Grandia 2, is it on there?
4807040	4811080	Well, Grandia 2 was a good one, then there was a Grandia 3 and I think a Grandia Extreme,
4811080	4817360	which I haven't played the latter ones, but nothing to me, I mean, Grandia is probably
4817360	4821040	up there in my list, this would actually, I even like this better than Final Fantasy
4821040	4826240	7, and Final Fantasy 6, if that's an indication of how much I like it.
4826240	4831240	The way I got my Saturn version was very fun, because at the time I got my Saturn version
4831240	4835700	they were going for about 80 to 100 bucks a piece, I bought one for 15 that said the
4835700	4840080	discs were damaged, so I was like, I'll just rip them and re-burn them, right?
4840080	4845040	So this is at Anime Expo, probably the last year I went, and I was going in to watch the
4845040	4849200	Utena movie, and I ended up just sitting out in the hall waiting for it to be over, and
4849200	4855880	as I sat and tried to clean the discs, I realized that the discs weren't scratched, they actually
4855880	4864680	had stuff on them, so I cleaned off the discs, it looked like hot glue, and cleaned it all
4864680	4868680	off and lo and behold, I had perfect copies for 15 bucks.
4868680	4869680	Nice.
4869680	4874360	Like I said, this did have a Playstation release that is not nearly as good, however, the only
4874360	4880360	way you can play it in English is on Playstation, and I warn you, it is highly, highly censored,
4880360	4884200	especially the part where they go in the bar.
4884200	4889680	So it's really, really good, I say give it a try.
4889680	4894560	Alright, your classic game of the week boys and girls, Grandia, which is a series I know
4894560	4898680	a lot of people really have a lot of love for, so I'm sure that's going to be a, that's
4898680	4901360	not going to be disputed by many as a classic game.
4901360	4907200	Oh, real quick though, I do have the series, it was Grandia 2 and Grandia 3, and then the
4907200	4911460	spinoffs were Grandia Digital Museum, which is basically like a bunch of artwork and voice
4911460	4916440	files and stuff that went with it, Grandia Parallel Trippers, and Grandia Extreme, and
4916440	4920280	Grandia Online, which I'm going to play Grandia Online.
4920280	4921280	Sounds like fun.
4921280	4926520	Alright, well that's going to bring part A of our show to a close, but hey, stay tuned,
