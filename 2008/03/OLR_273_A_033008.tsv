13953	23611	Tonight, March 30th, 2008, Gamers4Hackers get the SmackDown from Microsoft, Rockband is announced for the Wii, and is another PSP redesign on the way?
32935	37338	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37398	44323	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44403	45683	My name is Rob Roberts.
45844	50066	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50406	50787	Roar.
51247	51767	How are you doing?
51968	52628	Ah, I'm scared.
53228	53509	Roar.
55550	58132	Things going good for you?
58952	59693	Fairly decently.
60193	60273	Ah.
61004	63587	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
79125	85629	We got the announcement about, you know, I had to make decisions about what the hell's going to happen with the show, the station going offline.
85649	87431	Not the show, but the station going offline in a couple weeks.
88151	89852	Somehow I did the math wrong when I looked at the calendar.
89872	93234	I thought tonight was the last show on Life is Five, but it's actually next Saturday.
93535	93855	Or next...
95291	97032	Apparently I still can't read a calendar.
97373	100094	It's next Sunday is going to be the last show on Life's Easy Five.
100375	102336	I somehow missed that there was one more week in March.
102736	103417	So whatever.
103517	104717	So here we are on March 30th.
105158	108460	April 6th will be the last show on LifeEasyFive.com.
108740	112783	And then April 13th, something else, which we'll get to in a little bit.
113023	114644	The future of Orange Lounge Radio.
115024	120748	We'll talk about that in a little bit, but I wouldn't want to get away from how we usually start things off with.
120788	121709	How was your gaming week?
123050	123170	Um...
124193	127655	It was very Ragnarok-ing, as usual.
128755	137240	And then I turned on my DS to play some Final Fantasy VI, and then turned it off promptly, because I ran out of time.
140241	142563	And that was pretty much it.
142783	147465	Oh yeah, and we were going to be able to get another pinball machine, but that fell through.
148446	150086	Which pinball machine?
151207	151807	Attack from Mars.
152568	153248	Oh, I like that one.
153638	154479	Dan and Will to buy it, um...
180407	183289	Big Bang Bar, the Uber Rare Table, what pinball table would you like to own more than anything?
211440	217283	Um, I actually have a pan list of a couple.
218344	223186	Um, one of them would actually be, um, Black Knight 2000.
224467	226788	Because we have actually a Black Knight right now that we're borrowing.
227909	231290	Um, oh god, I know what this is called.
231350	234512	It's, um, it's one that's like an airplane theme, like a jet theme.
235172	240275	They had it, um, at Pentagogo, and it was, um, the whole game was like nothing but ramps.
240976	241396	WorldCupSoccer94
267250	269011	That is the machine to me.
269191	270271	I have the one I want.
270471	272072	And the husband's not allowed to sell that ever.
272452	272872	Ever.
274032	277413	And I have the other one that I really like, which is Twilight Zone.
277734	278154	Well, cool.
278814	283355	So those two were up there for my two favorite tables.
283676	285736	We actually are still trying to get me a Doctor Who.
286917	287497	Very cool.
287917	290658	I almost bought the TARDIS out of a Doctor Who on eBay.
290698	291098	I remember, like,
294315	295437	A Tommy machine wouldn't be bad.
295457	296298	It has a giant pinball on top.
313123	314644	I like the Jurassic Park pinball.
314664	317006	That's the one I was like, because the big dinosaur came down and ate your ball.
317266	319908	But my favorite table ever was that in the family game.
320068	320588	I love that one.
320848	323210	We have a Simpsons pinball party.
323931	324951	That machine's a bitch.
325572	326012	Why is that?
326032	326572	It's hard.
327313	328774	Oh my God, is that one hard.
328814	331436	And Dan got rid of my Rocky and Bullwinkle, which I really liked.
332296	336179	But Stern is bringing out a new Indiana Jones table.
336199	337400	I don't know if I mentioned that.
338501	339141	So that's pretty cool.
339181	340022	Yeah, I think last week.
340062	340562	So that's cool.
340842	341543	That's pretty cool.
341603	341863	All right.
342829	343590	The market's still there.
344490	346091	There definitely is still a market for pinball.
346231	348932	It's fun, and there's still rabid fans for that.
349452	350573	But we're getting off base.
350593	352094	Someone's playing Klonoa 2.
352134	352954	What's that?
352974	357076	Someone in chat's playing Klonoa 2, and that game's fucking awesome and very depressing.
357596	364100	You know what would bring pinball back is if they made a way to make it competitive against a couple teams.
364140	368642	I've actually had sort of like a cocktail machine that had two sides on it.
369404	379029	Um, at Classic Gaming Expo, and I think I've seen it there, and at Pentagogo, they have the versus tables, but those are, they're not very fun.
380030	387514	If you want to join our chat room so Jamie can have random outbursts at the games you're playing this week, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go do it.
388143	393324	Meanwhile, Loki, I'm thinking you're going to bring us back to console games with your gaming week.
393684	393924	Yes.
394864	399405	This week I played Crisis Core, so that was pretty cool.
399525	404866	It's definitely a lot different than, say, your typical Final Fantasy RPG.
405246	406586	I'm not sure if it's too similar to 12.
406646	410827	The combat system's sort of real-time, I guess.
410947	414988	You run around and you kind of mash buttons, but it's okay.
415008	415088	Okay.
415772	418654	Very linear so far, but like I said, I'm not that far in the game.
419415	423217	But if it continues the way it is, it's a very linear game.
423957	425238	But it's fun so far.
426199	427039	Love the cutscenes, though.
427059	428160	The cutscenes are pretty awesome.
428820	435745	And then I've also played Saints Row, actually the single player, because I'm trying to finish it before Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out.
436966	437886	Almost done with the game, though.
437986	438927	I'm on the last third.
439842	449369	and then I played just some weird stuff that we'll be probably getting into later like that Romjack Fail and Tetroid 2012.
451790	452551	That game's weird.
452731	456514	It's like Tetris and Silent Hill with Arkanoid.
456574	463158	I have to see this because when Loki says it's Tetris meets Silent Hill I'm like what the hell is that supposed to mean?
463578	463879	You know?
463939	464659	It's weird though.
464679	465039	Alright.
465100	465720	You gotta check it out.
465760	466480	Alright, I will.
467001	467121	Um...
468365	470866	And then that's pretty much it.
470886	474207	I think I may have played a little bit of Brawl in there, too, at some point.
475528	485792	The cool thing, though, because mainly this entire week I've been busy trying to get that stupid 360 working, the second one that went down, and finally fixed it, actually.
486992	493655	Basically, at a certain point, it's always when I just say, okay, fuck it, it's not going to work ever again, I'm just going to go all out and, you know.
494144	495325	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
517609	529397	Now we have one more to go, but this one was a lot easier because I bought a replacement warranty sticker, so I'm going to slap that on there and put the old case back on there and send it to Microsoft.
529537	531138	This one, no work involved.
531738	540824	So far, three out of six have broken, but I fixed two out of the three, so that's not bad so far.
543305	543565	Nice.
543846	544946	Is there anything else to report?
545066	545727	Nothing else?
545767	545827	Um...
546983	547643	Pretty much it.
548184	551065	Hopefully we'll have some cool stuff to show Justin.TV later.
551405	551645	Yes.
552906	554186	Right now, that's about it.
554366	557588	Speaking of Justin.TV, we do have a webcam feed of our show.
557628	558648	It's kind of crap tonight.
558688	558989	I don't know.
559009	559909	The Wi-Fi is kind of...
560387	561388	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
584867	589611	Yeah, I've played the game a million times, but it's still one of my favorites from, you know, way back yonder.
589671	603682	So I was playing like Root Beer Tapper, Tempest, and some of the other things on Xbox Live that are, you know, they're not like scream up and down and shout and type wonderful games, but, you know, they are classics.
603742	606625	And some of them, I don't even like the upgraded versions of some of them.
606645	610348	Like, I don't think I like the upgraded version of Tempest nearly as much as the original.
610748	614331	And I don't know if it's just like, I can't see as much of what's going on or what have you, but
615355	618016	I got like some old achievements that for some reason I never got.
618436	620256	So it was kind of fun.
620596	631098	And I also checked out that new release, Tikal or Tikal, Tikal, whatever that new puzzle game is on Xbox Live this week, which is OK.
631218	640000	It's kind of like Tetris meets Luminous, sort of like you have to make the little blocks that you do in Luminous, but you make them with Tetris shaped pieces in different colors.
640360	641360	And it's not just two colors.
641420	642441	It's like four different colors.
643501	644081	It's kind of.
644810	645890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
665738	668360	But yet, I don't believe this game is a PopCap game.
668380	669681	I believe it's made by somebody else.
669961	672383	Now, the game itself has nothing to do with Zuma.
672403	676505	I mean, the games themselves are completely separate, except for the fact they're both puzzle-ish games.
676625	680648	They have that other one, too, that's just like kind of Zuma, or the same tribal thing.
680708	683770	It was, um... Not Crystal Quest.
683850	687453	It was, um... Oh, Miss, uh, Magnetica.
688013	689514	No, no, no, no, no.
689594	690475	No, not like Zuma.
690495	691375	I'm talking about the tribal thing.
691435	692896	It's an Xbox Live Arcade game.
693237	694117	Oh, uh, Jewel Quest.
694377	695118	Jewel Quest, yeah.
695138	695218	Yeah.
697896	702318	And Jewel Quest is like bejeweled with one little twist to it.
702478	703138	It's interesting.
703658	708960	But I didn't end up really buying the full version of it because the demo gives you a really good taste of the game.
709160	710301	And I just, I don't know.
711581	716964	I can't keep justifying these little $5 and $10 purchases for games I'm not going to play more than a couple times.
717424	718744	So that's that.
719365	722806	Some days I do wish Xbox Live would switch to that model of you just pay...
723790	724611	Tickle Tickle
746597	748880	Alright, Tickle.
750841	751482	I like Tickle.
751782	752984	Gerardimo says Tickle.
753084	754765	A mashup of good puzzle games.
754845	756307	Why did you expect it to be decent?
756547	757588	Because I like puzzle games.
757968	759430	And I would say it's decent.
759650	761272	It just didn't wow me.
761332	763914	Like the first time I played Luminous, I was like, this game is the shit.
763954	764495	I love this game.
765095	768218	It didn't wow me, but it wasn't horrible either.
769653	780696	The other thing I did during my gaming week, you know I'm like, I think I mentioned this a couple weeks ago on the show, I've been really late to the Steam bandwagon, you know, on the PC, getting Steam and checking that out, which is kind of like,
781434	786736	X-Fire meets Xbox Live meets an online-type store kind of thing on your PC.
787857	791078	I downloaded that a couple weeks ago, and I finally bought a game this week.
791398	800041	And the game I bought was Portal, because Loki finally took his copy of the Orange Box back a little while ago, and I was very sad I couldn't play that on an Xbox 360 anymore.
800302	804723	But the only game in there I was really, really missing and wanting to play again was Portal.
805344	806264	And I'll tell you what.
807412	808193	Big difference.
808313	818426	And I know this is like a classic debate, but it's not something I often think about because I do most of my gaming on console and, you know, World of Warcraft on the PC and a couple other things here and there.
818727	825496	I don't often think about this, but there really is a world of difference between keyboard and mouse and two analog sticks.
826304	832429	I think I actually do a lot better with a keyboard and mouse than I do analog sticks.
832449	833910	I know it's a classic debate.
833950	835412	People say, this is better, this is better.
835852	838734	I might actually be a little better at Halo if I could use a keyboard and mouse in it.
838754	841757	And yes, I know I could get Halo 2 and Vista, but I don't have Vista.
841937	850023	Well, you can also get one of the, they have the T-Mix Acuter stuff that you can buy that you can hook up a keyboard and mouse and do it that way.
850824	855748	I do like how you actually fire the portal gun with a PC, your left or right click.
856794	858535	I think that's a little bit more intuitive.
859216	859756	Yeah, I don't know.
861618	866802	I kind of like the feel of it on the PC a little better than I did on the Xbox 360.
867683	872647	You know, the Xbox 360, I could still play that on my big screen TV, and it was loud, and it was nice.
873468	877751	And this one, whereas I have a widescreen monitor out here, it's not very big, but it's still pretty.
877932	879533	So, you know, same game.
880219	882180	You know we love Portal here at Orange Lounge Radio.
882200	889603	I don't have a lot to say about the game, but just kind of making that transition was very interesting because it's the exact same game, just playing it two different ways.
889663	891804	And I think I actually do a lot better with the mouse.
892224	899107	And I think part of what Jamie said has a lot to do with that, just the way you control the firing and just the movement is different and all that.
901027	902528	It took me a minute to get used to moving, though.
903454	908536	because sometimes with the whole WASD, I think if you hit two of them at the same time, it gets confused.
909617	913598	It's a little unlike World of Warcraft, which also does a WASD, but anyway.
914118	920501	One thing I will say about the difference on there too, just for perspective, I get more motion sick watching it on a TV.
922322	926584	Is it because it's just bigger, and so more of your vision is taken up by the images?
927164	928664	That could possibly be it.
929185	932326	But I was watching on a widescreen laptop before.
934581	961341	Ross Steel UT in chat says Street Fighter would be an atrocity on a keyboard and mouse yeah I remember an old actually I had Street Fighter 2 Turbo Super Duper whatever it was the last big one they did they had a computer version of it on CD that had Redbook audio for the different stages like redone music and so yeah I had that on the PC and I played it on the keyboard and it's just not the same it's just not the same and then I go way way back and I think about Stick Fighter
962233	963153	Stick Fighter is fucking awesome.
963193	964434	Everybody ever play Stick Fighter?
965574	966755	Remember that game back in the day?
966775	971596	If you've never played Stick Fighter, it's got to be out there on the internet somewhere.
971936	973657	It was one of those like back in the shareware days.
973677	976718	You probably have to get a slowdown program to make it work okay.
976738	982540	I imagine it's like way, but Stick Fighter was a Street Fighter 2 clone, but it used nothing but stick figures.
982940	986281	But they actually stole voice samples out of the game in some of the later versions.
986301	986881	It was great.
987481	988182	That was great.
989282	989542	All right.
990566	994689	Let's get into tonight's housekeeping since we're done with our gaming weeks.
995049	996190	We'll get into housekeeping tonight.
996210	1007859	I know the question on everybody's mind is, okay, we dropped that bombshell last week that Orange Lounge Radio is going to be closing its doors as a live 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week station as of April 12th.
1008579	1009240	I'm sorry, April 3rd.
1009440	1011621	Yeah, no, April 12th is our last broadcast today.
1014198	1015700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1028433	1040417	I want to kind of thank everybody that sent us emails this week and sent us private messages and all of that sort and posts on forums and things with suggestions for us.
1040537	1043718	I think I got told to check out about 10 different websites.
1044858	1048599	A couple people actually offered to host a streaming thing for us.
1049679	1053681	I wasn't able to do a lot of research on that, but I think that's very cool that people would do that.
1055327	1084869	but ultimately we decided to take things in a different direction and it was kind of the first thing that came it was the first idea that we had here at Orange Lounge Radio to do with the future of the show and um and first let me say this as well chat it's not April Fool's okay it just so happens live 365 you know if you've listened to the show long enough you know we freaking hate April Fool's Day okay so the last thing we would do is do something crappy like that for April Fool's Day this is not an April Fool's joke okay so um
1085771	1086772	Now I lost my train of thought.
1086812	1087392	Damn you, chat.
1087472	1087952	What was I saying?
1088012	1088232	Oh, yes.
1088452	1092635	So the first idea that came to our minds is the one we decided to go with.
1092915	1100219	And so we emailed some people and did some talking and looks like everybody's on board.
1100819	1102160	So this is what's going to happen, folks.
1102640	1112605	Starting April 13th, that's episode number 275 of our show, we will now be officially a part of allgames.com.
1113103	1120685	We are going to merge, essentially, some of our shows from our station with the operations they have over at allgames.com.
1121585	1133087	And in a way, I've been kind of joking all week long, it's creating a Voltron of independent podcasting, and that's kind of what I really believe in what's going to happen.
1133607	1141689	Because while we could have set up our own feed and taken one of these offers to set up our own thing and run our own music feed and live thing,
1142668	1144891	Music and all that stuff takes a long time to set up.
1145151	1148375	It's more than just putting MP3s at random, trust me for this.
1150477	1154282	So, you know, it's kind of like...
1155126	1166294	Why would we want to do that and run this whole separate thing when there's this perfectly established station going on over there that we already have a good relationship with because our show's been syndicated over on the network?
1166334	1167254	We know the people there.
1167274	1168475	We like the people over there.
1169016	1171737	We're kind of something different-ish on the network.
1171797	1173859	It's a type of show they don't have otherwise.
1174319	1179883	Why go run off and do our own thing when we can instead come together and form...
1181482	1182042	DarkSakura.com
1209383	1212165	and there's the fact that you can listen to it on your PSP now.
1212565	1219790	If you check out allgames.com on your PSP and I believe it's in the... It's one of the preset stations in the PSP as well.
1223112	1224013	It's going to be a good thing.
1224313	1227395	The more and more I kind of think about it, the more I think this is like the right idea for us.
1228176	1233579	Here also, I have no announcements at this time as far as our other shows go.
1234260	1236481	Speaking of Travis Donovan and DMN.
1236982	1237502	However...
1239257	1243399	We are in talks to have that be a part of the merge, and they didn't say no.
1243859	1245360	So right now that's all in limbo.
1245380	1253923	I have nothing further to say at this time, but that is exciting that some of our other stuff will probably go over there as well if everybody's happy.
1254623	1255264	Let's put it that way.
1256924	1257705	I think it'll be good, though.
1258545	1259445	I think it's going to be a great thing.
1259985	1261026	Anything else you guys want to add?
1262106	1262807	I got nothing to add.
1263147	1263667	Nothing to add?
1263867	1264467	DarkSakura?
1264707	1265488	I like pastrami.
1265588	1266228	You like pastrami?
1268655	1270276	Thank you for watching!
1281943	1283424	So, we're not going to.
1283824	1287526	I mean, we might do some aesthetic type changes with this move.
1287586	1292869	Like, we might take the opportunity to clean up our album art, maybe do a different audio.
1292889	1294891	You know, we might make some small aesthetical changes.
1295251	1300174	But as far as the content that you're actually going to hear in the show, nothing's going to change in that regard.
1300274	1302115	Macquarie and Jamie, there will be more pastrami.
1304005	1305086	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1327862	1331465	But honestly, you're not going to have to change your subscription or anything like that.
1331505	1332606	You're still going to get the podcast.
1332806	1334527	It's like nothing ever happened for you guys.
1334567	1336449	If you've never listened to us live, it's going to be like nothing ever happened.
1336469	1339511	And I hate to say it, even though the sound may be in higher quality, the show will not.
1339651	1341413	Yes, the show will not be in higher quality.
1341433	1342093	I'm sorry to say.
1343194	1344895	So there it is.
1346096	1346396	I don't know.
1346436	1347477	Is there anything else to add?
1347577	1348458	Anything else we should say?
1349522	1350082	I don't think so.
1350263	1351043	I'm out of soda.
1351283	1351904	That's not good.
1371596	1372157	Thank you for watching!
1384853	1385794	I think that's about it
1415558	1417061	I need it easier than that.
1419064	1419705	Bookmark it.
1419785	1421068	I don't know what else to tell you.
1422441	1426804	Zlatan asks, will it be 30 seconds behind like Live 365?
1427285	1436472	I do not think the buffer will be as great because I think we're having to say, because right now we send from my computer to Live 365 who encodes it to their server.
1437153	1439215	I don't think it's going to be as much of a delay.
1439815	1445480	I think there will still be a delay, but that's inevitable because of the encoding process, but it won't be like 30 seconds.
1446221	1447042	It'll be an hour.
1447082	1450244	Oh, BlackWolf, Bobby BlackWolf is in chat helping to clear the air right now.
1450284	1450764	Thank you, Bobby.
1451105	1453086	He actually says it still will be 30 seconds.
1453186	1456929	That's just inevitable, I mean, because it's buffer and all that stuff, so.
1458130	1461692	Ross Steel, UT, says, fuck that, bring BlackWolf on and make fun of him.
1461712	1462813	We just might do that, actually.
1462933	1464514	No, we love Bobby, of course.
1464654	1468137	Bobby has actually been very instrumental in making this happen, so we love Bobby.
1468677	1473961	Actually, that's another really good thing is because when we're live on Sunday nights...
1475012	1479657	Bobby's show airs at 5 o'clock and he says that he's going to keep his show to an hour.
1479737	1483020	Maybe occasionally he'll run over, but very little.
1483280	1489806	But the nice thing is that instead of having music as a lead-in, we're going to have a really good quality show.
1490367	1495852	It's almost like being on a real television network where you have a quality show as a lead-in to your show.
1496312	1496953	It's going to be great.
1497552	1499293	and I think the listeners are really going to benefit.
1499573	1503075	And we're all going to benefit because we'll get some of Bobby's people, he'll get some of our people.
1503475	1505897	That all goes into the Voltron of independent podcasting.
1506217	1511240	It's like when they have heroes on and then they have Chuck and then everyone turns the TV off when Chuck comes on.
1511260	1513561	Well, I'm hoping it doesn't go like that, but maybe.
1515022	1515282	Rob.
1515982	1516202	What?
1516383	1516923	Will it blend?
1518924	1519925	It may indeed blend.
1521025	1521385	We'll see.
1523515	1527822	WetWeToo in chat says, as usual, OLR is the gamer tech podcast.
1527842	1529404	Whatever happened to OLR Food Network?
1529765	1531247	OLR Food Network is still here.
1532429	1533210	Pastrami, Jamie?
1534092	1534493	Yum.
1534713	1535033	All right.
1535234	1536476	With cheese and grilled onions.
1536937	1537678	And no burger!
1538504	1538744	All right.
1538824	1539325	I'm so mad.
1563317	1567500	And they also have talk radio that plays throughout the day, which I think is highly entertaining.
1567840	1569661	And you never know what might happen in the future.
1569781	1570462	You never know.
1570542	1578667	This is going to free all of us up to kind of be working towards a more common goal now and working on, you know, kind of the visibility of the same radio station.
1579028	1579908	It's going to be a good thing.
1580028	1580929	All right, I'll shut up.
1581009	1581890	I'll stop talking about it.
1581930	1583090	We're beating this topic into the ground.
1583591	1585832	Let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki.
1593157	1597659	A few tracks that will be available for, I guess, fans of Aerosmith.
1598580	1607524	Of course, included in these are Make It, Uncle Salty, Draw the Line, No Surprise, and Sweet Emotion.
1608345	1610606	So, that's kind of neat.
1611286	1614608	And there's going to be, I guess, 40 plus songs in the game.
1614628	1619911	60% of it, of course, I guess, will be devoted to Aerosmith.
1620371	1621572	In fact, actually, I saw like...
1622768	1624269	The way they kind of have it set up is neat.
1624289	1628253	You're going to be doing different sets, I guess, follow their career a little bit.
1628993	1640042	So they'll have two songs that are openers that are from a different band, and then they'll have three Aerosmith songs, maybe like a bonus song or something like that, and they're going to have different sets set up like that.
1641403	1644046	As long as it's better than Guitar Hero Rocks the 80s, right?
1645006	1646768	I think it will be, I mean...
1647452	1647852	Steve Tyler's Lips
1666722	1668344	and those big ol' lips are on the cover.
1668764	1671207	Is that going to be enough, do you think, to sell this game?
1671588	1673210	Maybe, but here's the thing.
1674031	1681160	The easiest way to decide if you want this game or not is to wait until they get down to the point where they announce the entire soundtrack to the game.
1681750	1685052	And then just, okay, is that something that you want or not?
1685913	1688394	My guess is they're not going to have download content for this game.
1688655	1692097	It's probably just going to be, you know, these songs and that's it.
1692117	1695859	Because, I mean, why would they cut into their Guitar Hero 3 download content?
1695879	1698961	Which, of course, is still going to be going on until Guitar Hero 4 comes out.
1701380	1701941	Thanks for watching!
1717254	1722595	A lot of these music games are really starting to milk it to the point of getting sick of this.
1722775	1733398	In fact, we'll be getting to some other stuff later like SingStar, which... I'm thinking part of the reason that makes this so alluring is that it looks like they're just using the same damn engine from Guitar Hero 3.
1734118	1735178	It's updated a little bit.
1735238	1737198	The engine itself is actually upgraded a bit.
1737218	1738339	Define a little bit.
1738939	1742539	The graphics are a little bit better, animations are recaptured and they're a lot smoother.
1743680	1744720	Stuff like that, but...
1745390	1747050	Yeah, it's basically Guitar Hero 3.
1748091	1752771	Gerardimo in chat, chat.orange.com, suggests Guitar Hero ABBA mix.
1753511	1754352	I'd be down with that.
1754812	1756452	But do they use any real guitar?
1756852	1761673	No, but you know, they have an opening for a drummer, so there might be Drum Hero.
1761693	1762613	No, I had to laugh, though.
1763053	1763573	You're going to love this.
1763853	1773435	I had to laugh because on the trailer, you know how they have all the little logos of the different people that have products in the game and stuff like that, and Gibson was on there?
1774181	1775422	I'm like, oh, that's funny.
1775843	1776423	Oh, the irony.
1777324	1777745	Ironic.
1778806	1779326	Very ironic.
1780307	1781268	It's like Ray Yane.
1783350	1789316	Well, we'll hear more about Guitar Hero Aerosmith in the future, I'm sure, as we get closer to the release date.
1789376	1795542	Another game we're hearing more and more about is Ninja Gaiden 2, which looks bloody fantastic.
1796627	1797587	Emphasis on bloody.
1797667	1798627	It looks wonderful.
1799808	1803869	Ninja Gaiden 2, if you want to see all that blood, the demo is going to be coming in May.
1805389	1808550	May is going to be the delivery of the Ninja Gaiden 2 demo.
1809310	1812271	That is according to Microsoft's Ninja Gaiden 2 website.
1812711	1818312	And apparently there's also supposed to be some exclusive content beginning on April 15th.
1818692	1826134	But if it's anything like previous exclusive content, it's probably crappy gamer picks and crappy themes and maybe some cool looking trailers.
1826983	1827784	Ninja Gaiden Hi-Rez
1850239	1852700	PENNY ARCADE ADVENTURES ON THE RAINSLICK PRECIPICE OF DARKNESS
1877480	1887624	There is a price out for it now, $19.95, which would be about half that numeric value in pounds for our UK listeners.
1888624	1891225	And that's just for the Windows, Mac, and Linux version of the game.
1891505	1893966	It's going to be released on Linux, that's cool.
1894906	1901068	There is an Xbox Live Arcade version that will have a simultaneous launch, no price released yet.
1902129	1905810	Five to ten hours of playing for you, so that's pretty cool.
1907526	1908106	No, it's weird.
1908166	1923056	I thought that they were saying that the Xbox Live Arcade version was going to be $20, which I thought was kind of surprising, seeing as they haven't really had a game that was spent $20.
1923356	1930261	I mean, I think most was like Luminous with $15 and stuff, but $20 for that game is really expensive.
1931001	1931882	It is a little steep.
1933823	1935304	This game better be epic as well.
1935967	1936347	For $20.
1936508	1938530	If I'm going to pay that much money, I'll just get it on Windows.
1939150	1943234	But, yeah, I was going to say, you know, $20 is kind of the average.
1943455	1946317	$19.95 is what you pay for a low-budget Windows game.
1946357	1948780	So is it really that obscene of a price on Xbox Live?
1948840	1949260	Not really.
1950441	1952423	But as long as the game is quality, that's what's important.
1952443	1955366	You know it has a great tie-in, you know,
1956434	1960896	I don't know a lot of gamers who don't love Penny Arcade, or at least like and respect it a lot.
1961336	1967760	So you know it's going to be at least the quality there, it's just the question of, but will it be, it's kind of like that question, will it blend?
1968320	1969520	Will it blend into a game?
1970361	1970761	We'll see.
1971902	1973022	Yeah.
1973703	1982707	Now a game that we're probably not going to get over here, unfortunately, Raiden Fighters Aces has gotten a demo on the Japanese Xbox Live.
1983066	1983526	XBOX Live Accounts
2014232	2025421	You know, there was, back in the day on the PlayStation, there was just, for the first two write-in games, before these came out, there was a compilation on there.
2025541	2028203	I would like to see one that's all of them.
2030345	2031566	That would be a big compilation.
2031886	2033247	That would be a very big compilation.
2033327	2034188	That would be epic.
2034585	2035886	You know what that compilation's called?
2036066	2036386	MAME.
2038067	2045271	Actually, the boards for the first three Raiden games have been intensely difficult for them to crack.
2045331	2051014	I think that they've only gotten... They haven't... As far as I know, they haven't cracked Raiden DX yet.
2052095	2052835	That game was fun.
2052875	2053936	We had that at our roundtable.
2054296	2059119	Dude, I like the electric one that latches on and does the swirly bit.
2059239	2059959	That was my favorite one.
2060119	2060379	Yeah.
2062620	2063381	We just need them all.
2064611	2076478	All right, well, talking about, you know, games coming from Japan and shooter games, you know, I guess somebody out there was just thinking to themselves, like, you know, we don't have enough shoot-em-up games on Xbox Live.
2076518	2077159	We really don't.
2077239	2077859	We need more.
2079380	2084483	And luckily, though, one of the granddaddies of shoot-em-up games is on its way to Xbox Live Arcade.
2084523	2085324	It's Ikaruga.
2085384	2087425	So I guess we can make room for that.
2087985	2089606	We can find room in there somewhere.
2090047	2093289	And, of course, we've been having rumors about this game for a couple weeks now.
2093749	2098112	And the latest one, I think last week we had the month nailed down as April.
2098132	2106818	Well, this week, thanks to Japan's version of Xbox.com, we now know that the release date is set to be April 9th.
2107718	2113322	Now, of course, all these types of things are always subject to change, and who knows, the Japanese website could have been wrong, but...
2114202	2120283	It does look pretty likely it's going to be out in early April rather than later, which isn't a bad thing because Ikaruga is pretty awesome.
2120603	2121264	It is pretty awesome.
2122564	2125144	So I guess we can make room for one more shooter if it's Ikaruga.
2125184	2128225	You know what I would rather see than Ikaruga?
2128345	2128505	What?
2128725	2129545	Radiant Silvergun.
2130485	2131266	You never know.
2131606	2132146	I wish.
2133646	2137547	Well, in other...
2138763	2148107	News as far as games to be out, and this is actually more of a leak from the ESRB, and this would be also for Xbox Live.
2149428	2154771	Darwinia is supposed to be coming out, and it actually was confirmed.
2155311	2167737	It's actually listed as Darwinia Plus, Survival of the Flat, which is, okay, from what I'm understanding on here, it's a multiplayer version, Multiwinia, Survival of the Flattest.
2168707	2173131	So it's fairly interesting, and we've had a lot of people tell us about this game, that it's supposed to be really good.
2173512	2177676	But there's actually a demo out for Windows, Mac, and Linux right now.
2180058	2184442	Quiltipo in chat says, Screw Darwinia, I want Darwin Awards the game.
2186104	2188226	Isn't that just pain on PlayStation Network?
2188266	2188746	I'm not sure.
2188906	2190648	That sounds sort of like it.
2191623	2194044	But no, Darwinia, I've heard nothing but good things about Darwinia.
2194104	2199385	So it's kind of neat that these little games are getting this more massive distribution.
2199685	2208507	And I'm assuming from the whole plus in the name, there's going to be a lot of extra features, which probably will, you know, be justifying the cost of it on Xbox Live.
2208587	2210707	But I look forward to an easy way to check it out.
2211027	2217468	Well, if anyone wants to check out the demo, go to introversion.co.uk slash Darwinia.
2218349	2219889	And you can download the demo there.
2221297	2223298	It's a headache.
2252824	2256847	No interest from me whatsoever, but hey, I know a lot of people liked it.
2257627	2261530	I played it once, and I know it has a rabid fan base because of its quirky sense of humor.
2261810	2262011	Yes.
2262531	2267135	So, if you're looking forward to it, I would say probably going to see it in November.
2269837	2271638	How highly anticipated do you think this game is?
2271678	2275701	I mean, one thing I also know about Banjo-Kazooie is it's been a long time since there's been a game in this series.
2275721	2280665	Well, they teased it at E3 last year, but that's probably the last we've heard of it.
2281308	2281508	Hmm.
2282769	2283109	I don't know.
2283129	2283869	It'll be neat.
2284010	2289893	I mean, they need some good family games, I guess, because Viva Pinata's not that great.
2290393	2291013	I mean, no offense.
2291033	2291914	Well, I don't know.
2292094	2293515	There's people that love Viva Pinata.
2293555	2298718	I think the wrong people that Microsoft thought were going to get into Viva Pinata got into Viva Pinata.
2298778	2299278	Here's the thing.
2299478	2304341	Well, they should take a note from it that they need a good sim game on the Xbox 360, okay?
2304901	2309484	Then, what they should do, though, Viva Pinata, though, it's...
2310598	2313219	Gold Banjo in chat says Banjo Kazooie is awesome, that's what my screen name is named after
2339872	2340292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2359929	2360609	Here's the deal.
2361250	2366093	Microsoft has been going through and finding people who have been cheating in games.
2366493	2368395	Doing save game hacks.
2369495	2370796	How do people cheat their gamerscore?
2370836	2371897	Loki, you ought to know this stuff.
2372057	2373118	Why would I know this stuff?
2373138	2374859	Just because I know you would know this stuff.
2375499	2384786	Apparently there's some workarounds that they can actually do where it hacks their actual profile that you don't even need to play the game to get the achievement points from.
2384866	2385166	Wow.
2385974	2388356	That's what they're really cracking down on, is stuff like that.
2388896	2389537	Interesting.
2389597	2393020	Because you can't do the save stuff anymore.
2393060	2398784	They have that stupid digital rights management thing that they threw in there to fuck everybody over with everything.
2400225	2403988	That stopped people from save swapping and stuff like that.
2404348	2410253	And not all the games worked with save swapping, so it was very unreliable stuff.
2411400	2412001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2428877	2435782	So now these folks basically get the scarlet question mark, or it's more the orange question mark on their profile that labels them as a cheater.
2435802	2449011	I can't wait because, you know, I'm not too optimistic on Microsoft in picking people that cheat, and I have a feeling they're going to make some mistakes in there, and they're going to pick people that, like, did not cheat, and they're going to mark them as cheaters, and that's going to have a whole backlash thing.
2449051	2452193	I mean, I would just ban these people from Xbox Live.
2452833	2453714	Why aren't they just doing that?
2453734	2455195	Because they seem to do that with everything else.
2455295	2458037	I don't understand why they just have to... Making examples of them.
2458675	2459496	Well, that's fine.
2459816	2466279	I have no problem with them making examples out of them, but I have a feeling that they're going to get some people that really didn't cheat.
2466880	2468500	Why's it got to be an orange question mark?
2468841	2469681	What's wrong with orange?
2470181	2471742	You got a problem with orange, Microsoft?
2471762	2472963	Why's it got to be an orange question mark?
2473533	2473853	Jerks?
2474213	2475774	Well, it's kind of a gold orange.
2476014	2476294	Shut up.
2478074	2485016	But I don't think at the same time Microsoft is like running rampant accusing everybody of being a witch, you know?
2485556	2485876	Witch!
2487017	2487497	Cheetah!
2488497	2489377	Burn the cheetah!
2489797	2491618	We found a witch, may we burn her?
2492158	2495899	I don't think Microsoft is running through the village accusing everybody of being a witch.
2496459	2499760	I think they just targeted some of the high profile people like
2500481	2502421	Strip Club, GJ, you know that guy.
2503242	2517784	I just know him because he actually messaged me once because I got DDR Universe the day it came out and I was playing it like all day long and I had like 500 gamerscore and I must have had one of the higher gamerscores out of anybody that day because he messaged me and he was like, how was the game?
2517824	2518184	Is it good?
2518224	2520025	Is it easy to get the gamerscore?
2520485	2528106	So I remember him because I laughed my ass off when I saw I was getting this message from him and I heard he was one of the people that got caught with this and sure enough, yes he is.
2528880	2530022	I almost have 10,000 gamer points.
2530082	2532044	No thanks to my friend playing Rock Band for me.
2544676	2547238	But that's not cheating in the sense of Microsoft cheating.
2547638	2549660	Sire Ran says, how do you know it's a cheater?
2549700	2550660	It looks like one!
2551000	2552441	They turned me into a Yaris.
2552822	2556865	Turned me into a... I got better.
2557445	2559827	Strip Club DJ made me play Yaris.
2561248	2562428	That's punishable by death.
2564150	2564510	Burn him!
2565455	2566496	How do you know they're a cheater?
2566876	2567736	Build a game out of them!
2593032	2594333	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2621839	2623861	I know, I know, which is a very broad term.
2623881	2625362	You know what we're parrying here, Jamie.
2625382	2634149	It should be, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, a, uh, a Goomba hunt.
2636110	2637491	It should be a release dates.
2638312	2639513	Yeah, how about that?
2640193	2642435	I got some release dates right here, okay?
2642595	2642855	Anyway.
2643716	2644957	Um, I have four.
2646458	2647599	And two of them are the same game.
2648259	2648900	Alright, what's that?
2648920	2649200	So...
2650621	2656963	Baroque on the first for PS2 and Wii and Kingdom 2 Bloodshot on Xbox 360 and PS3.
2657663	2658163	And that's it.
2658944	2662325	Now how can she predict the future about all these games coming out in the UK?
2662765	2663665	It's because she's a witch!
2664485	2664745	Witch!
2665385	2667626	No, it's because I have reliable sources.
2667646	2669207	Oh, okay.
2669267	2670587	Reliable witch sources!
2671758	2677262	I looked into my cauldron and lit some charcoal and read it in the smoke.
2677302	2681845	No, I want the Witch Hunt joke to die now before it gets too old.
2681985	2683186	There's going to be a wiki on it now.
2685127	2687428	I love the OLR wiki more than anything.
2687489	2688449	It's so great.
2688609	2689550	Sorry, as is it.
2689910	2693032	All right, Loki, what's going on in the U.S.?
2693493	2696074	Not a whole lot of good stuff, unfortunately.
2697415	2701118	No, this time around we get some crap, including...
2702279	2708825	Rafa Nadal, Tennis on the DS I think that came out already, but eh, whatever.
2709365	2712308	It's probably a GameStop exclusive, but that's okay, it sucks.
2713569	2716851	Octomania got delayed, I guess, a week or so.
2717392	2722816	That's now coming out on the Wii, $19.99 for Puzzle Game, and it has online, so that's not bad.
2723237	2724798	And it's Atlus, you gotta support Atlus.
2725899	2728441	And, let's see, Monochemia, uh,
2729147	2734250	Alchemist of Al Rivas, and that's a new Koei RPG for the PlayStation 2.
2736272	2739814	There's a game called Toy Shop, which is coming out on the DS.
2739994	2742696	I guess it's like a sim Toy Shop game.
2744077	2746999	And let's see here, Call of Duty 4, Game of the Year Edition.
2747219	2749420	That's coming out on the 1st as well.
2749480	2755784	That's just a re-release of Call of Duty 4 with the downloadable map pack, or token for that.
2756445	2758506	So if you don't have it yet, that's probably the way you want to go.
2760435	2762637	and let's see here.
2764157	2767919	There's also World Championship cards on the PSP.
2770561	2772322	But that's pretty much it.
2774397	2775817	Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Eye of Judgment, Nintendo Wii,
2794824	2798086	This is a very slow week in Japan as far as the next-gen systems go.
2799226	2808110	Well, on the PlayStation 2, you get Pro Yaku Spirits 5 comes out, which is another baseball simulator game.
2808190	2810231	So there's that, I suppose, to look forward to.
2810991	2813092	And let's see if there's anything on the handhelds.
2813353	2815273	Surely there's got to be something on the Nintendo DS.
2816254	2817194	No, there's really not.
2817955	2819916	Oh, on April 3rd, there is some stuff coming out.
2824107	2830371	One High Ten Fun by Igaizu Zunikakuru DS Detective Conan
2835988	2837149	There's a new game coming out there.
2837670	2841973	And this game coming from a group called FonFon is the publisher for this one.
2842634	2847818	Kuchan no Shiwase Kantan Oryuri Recipe comes out.
2847858	2851541	And it looks like a cooking game or it could be, I don't think it's cooking.
2851561	2853262	I think this is actually like a virtual cookbook.
2854183	2856685	It looks like it has like 300 recipes in a little virtual cookbook.
2856705	2859807	They were supposed to release something like that out here, but they never did.
2860268	2864251	Well, you can import this one, except I hope you can read Japanese or it's really not going to do you a lot of good.
2864673	2866674	Well, then you probably aren't going to be able to do it.
2867934	2869194	Anything on the PSP?
2870175	2874596	Yes, Star Ocean Second Evolution comes out on the Sony PSP from Squeenix.
2874636	2875216	That's pretty cool.
2875316	2877977	Yeah, so that would probably be one of the bigger releases in Japan this week.
2878017	2879778	Otherwise, you've got to really wait until next week.
2880558	2882039	Not a lot of big releases in Japan this week.
2882059	2888621	I guess it's a slow week all around, but probably because we're kind of in a little bit of a slow period until we get into, like, the summer games.
2890361	2891402	Then we'll see a lot of stuff.
2891862	2892082	Yeah.
2892591	2905734	Out of curiosity, real quick, before we get into the next story, because Summer Games reminded me, there's the Olympics this year, yet outside of Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, I haven't heard of a lot of, like, Beijing video games.
2905814	2906494	What's up with that?
2906534	2908454	Like, it seems like every year there's an Olympics.
2908494	2909174	There's some horrible games.
2909194	2911115	Sega is putting out an Olympics game in June.
2911615	2912515	Oh, okay.
2913015	2913875	Beijing Olympics.
2914296	2914516	Oh, wait.
2915836	2916996	So, yeah.
2917016	2917816	There is one coming.
2918176	2918936	Is it coming on the Wii?
2919397	2920497	PS3 and Xbox 360.
2921690	2922591	No Wii.
2922711	2925452	Oh, maybe they don't want it to interview with Mario and Sonic at the Olympics one.
2926953	2927453	Interesting.
2927673	2930755	I don't know about that, but there is one coming.
2931756	2932236	Interesting.
2932876	2934837	What are you giggling about over there, dare I ask?
2937859	2942121	I'm looking at the listener profiles on our wiki, and while Steel U teases, great.
2943962	2944503	Poor guy.
2944823	2945743	I know, I'm sorry.
2945763	2946544	Stop picking on him.
2946844	2948605	I didn't want to pick on him, but I just...
2950640	2951721	Did not expect it.
2952341	2953963	So I was like, okay.
2954623	2956905	Gerardimo said, Sky, why is that bad?
2957025	2957966	It's not necessarily bad.
2958006	2960148	I'm just curious.
2960348	2963811	And usually these Olympic games are fucking horrible anyway.
2964091	2969896	But I'm just curious because I was surprised I haven't heard a lot about tie-in games when the Beijing Olympics are kind of a big deal.
2970236	2971577	You want to hear something weird?
2971817	2972117	What's that?
2972318	2973679	I'm totally off topic here, but...
2974614	2980076	Next week, there's a game, or not next week, but the week after next, there's a game on the DS coming out called Plushies.
2980516	2981936	That reminds me of, like, furries.
2982797	2983317	Oh, no.
2984477	2985757	I want my ferret, Rob.
2985777	2986998	Let the jokes begin.
2987018	2988078	I want my ferret.
2988898	2989619	You want the ferret?
2989859	2990259	Yeah.
2991059	2992219	We might be able to make that happen.
2992640	2994080	But not unless you read us more news.
2994680	2995761	I have some news.
2998241	3000202	Sony has said they're sorry.
3000742	3003423	We already knew they were sorry, but they've also apologized, too.
3005732	3028996	they now have some updates to the PS3 store and one of them is Gran Turismo 5 Prologue which for the UK is $24.99 with UEFA Euro 2008 demo and Unreal Tournament 3 for free and Turok Map Packs for $1.99 and the Eye of Judgment Bio Rebellion card set for $6.99 also PS1 Realfishing
3033550	3036271	has been added for $3.49 to PS3 and PSP stores.
3036331	3044295	There's also trailers on the PS3 store for Everybody's Golf World Tour, Eye of Judgment...
3061147	3064169	GT5 Prologue, Dark Sector, and Dynasty Warriors 6.
3065509	3072053	And Sony said, we sorry, poo, poo on us.
3074609	3076550	Somehow I don't think they phrased it quite like that.
3076591	3084776	Well, to quote, as previously mentioned, we unfortunately experienced some last-minute technical difficulties and weren't able to publish the new content as planned.
3085256	3093041	However, we have been working hard to resolve these issues and are pleased to be able to let you know that basically they're all live on the UK store.
3093341	3095302	Yeah, this is specific, by the way, to the UK store.
3095763	3102767	But hey, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Pal is out, so if you want to play an extended demo, go for it.
3103639	3110501	I was going to say, also in the U.S., they made some announcements of upcoming stuff, not necessarily anything coming out right away.
3111041	3118422	But late April, we're going to be getting the Pixel Junk Monsters Encore, which is an expansion pack to, of course, Pixel Junk Monsters.
3119403	3125124	Early May, we'll be getting Echo Chrome, and in May sometime, Elefunc.
3126050	3154906	and then late May or early June Wipeout HD so that's pretty cool they had some pretty interesting videos for Wipeout some Omega Pack or something that got released had some really trippy kind of like cartoony tracks I don't know so definitely check those out if you own Wipeout Pulse on the PSP it should be on the Playstation Store you can download those okay some other fun stuff
3155732	3157333	Hey, guess what?
3157593	3161694	Bobby said he didn't need to make one creative change to our show, and that is that no more ferret.
3163375	3164275	Ferret, no.
3165155	3166616	The batteries are going to die in that thing.
3166816	3169457	You know that we've had that thing for as long as we've been doing this show?
3169577	3170037	It's a mascot.
3170077	3171797	Those batteries are going to die someday.
3172198	3173638	The ferret is eternal.
3173858	3174278	No, they won't.
3175339	3176499	You don't understand, Rob.
3176819	3179060	You can rip them open and put new batteries in.
3179080	3180220	That's how I got those other ones to work.
3180260	3182441	Why do you have to fucking tell her how to do it?
3183471	3184332	I know how to do it.
3184372	3187594	You could smile and nod and say, yes, Rob, the ferret will die.
3188294	3191216	But no, you have to say, oh, we can give it a lobotomy.
3192117	3195899	Look, there's almost a bald spot now from where I've been pressing it in the same spot.
3197560	3198501	That's ferret abuse.
3199141	3200942	I'm sorry, are we a video game podcast?
3200982	3202023	I was getting confused.
3202063	3203664	Well, I was going to get into a story.
3203684	3204985	We're the food and ferret cast.
3205966	3210889	But then you had to mention Bobby and it halted the show.
3211756	3214737	Anyways, so Grand Theft Auto 4.
3215117	3218698	Of course, they like to innovate with each new release that they're coming out.
3218758	3220178	Now, this is something very interesting.
3220578	3225419	What they're actually going to incorporate into Grand Theft Auto 4 is real-world music downloads.
3226180	3228460	And it's going to be tied in with Amazon.com.
3228860	3234802	Now, the way this works is in the game, you can actually call an in-game service called Zit on your mobile phone.
3235602	3239223	And you get text messages with song and artist names.
3239693	3265406	as well as an email if you're a member of the Rockstar Social Club and then when you download tracks or whatever they're going to be about 89 cents to 99 cents and they'll actually of course they're DRM free because they're MP3s but I guess you can download them in game and you'll also get them in the real world so that's pretty cool that you'll be able to download some music
3268922	3273603	Somebody by the nickname of Beatmania Slot Machine in our chatroom says, Orange Ferret Foodio.
3274923	3277764	I'm sorry, I misunderstood this a little bit.
3278324	3285645	The way this works is the soundtrack for the game, so the music actually inside the game, not additional music.
3285865	3292726	So if you hear a song you like on the radio or something like that, you can dial that service in the game and then get the MP3 sent to you.
3293406	3295627	I do have to make a comment to Beatmania Slot Machine.
3295747	3296067	What's that?
3296247	3298287	It's actually not a slot machine, it's Apache Slot
3299249	3300170	But we'll get to that later.
3300410	3302011	Don't spoil the upcoming news stories.
3302832	3303552	Don't spoil them.
3303752	3304313	I'm just kidding.
3305193	3314680	But I assume since this is an Xbox 360 game and a PS3 game that you'll be able to put your own music in there anyway, so that'd be cool.
3315180	3317242	Aren't they doing this in real cars, too?
3317322	3319343	Or at least I know there's that whole cell phone thing.
3319763	3327089	Isn't there a commercial on TV for Verizon or something where you hold up your cell phone and it will recognize the song and download it for you or something like that?
3327249	3329010	Yeah, there's stuff like that out there.
3329070	3329450	www.DarkSakura.com
3350817	3356180	You're not physically taking the money out of your wallet and handing it to somebody or your purse or whatever.
3356200	3357540	You're not handing it to somebody.
3357940	3361722	Therefore, it's so much easier to make these stupid impulse buys.
3362243	3369506	And I think this whole feature, while it's interesting and kind of cool, I guess, for a video game, is kind of capitalizing on that.
3369926	3375909	Because you know there are going to be a lot of people that buy this game, and there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be like, Ooh, I like this game.
3376029	3376329	Click!
3376509	3377350	Oh, I just spent a dollar.
3378092	3379213	But it's just a dollar.
3379393	3380454	That's what I hate about iTunes.
3380494	3381734	But I click 20 times.
3383255	3385217	Well, iTunes is almost the same type of thing.
3385257	3386017	That's what I was saying.
3386297	3387178	That's what I hate about iTunes.
3387478	3388799	Especially since it's on my damn phone!
3389767	3393569	I've gone how many years without buying a damn thing on iTunes until I got my phone?
3411195	3413296	and then I probably... I'm still okay.
3413336	3415398	I've probably only bought like 25 songs total.
3415718	3416698	It's that convenience.
3416879	3417439	I'm telling you.
3417499	3418800	We're such a lazy society.
3419100	3425124	I mean, it's not necessarily a... Like, I'm not saying like, oh, you're bad or, you know, oh, you're... But it's just kind of where we are.
3425144	3432068	I think it's more putting the temptation in there because honestly, and this is how me personally I am, I believe that the things worth having are worth working for.
3433229	3433509	You know?
3434497	3436059	It's like I'm putting a giant cookie.
3436199	3437320	No, no, I got it.
3437420	3440084	I'm putting a giant piece of pastrami in your hands.
3440264	3442627	I'm not that big on pastrami.
3443862	3447084	I wanted pastrami today, so I got pastrami.
3447524	3448225	Okay, fine.
3448265	3449486	Press button, get pastrami.
3449526	3449826	Fine.
3449886	3452207	Then I put a big bottle of Goldschlager in your hand.
3452267	3452888	I don't like Goldschlager.
3452928	3454829	And I say, well, goddammit, what is something you like?
3454869	3455489	Here's what I want.
3456790	3457490	I like sushi.
3457690	3458371	Okay, sushi.
3458711	3462193	I put a big piece of sushi in your hand, and I say, hold on to this for a little bit.
3462693	3467336	By the way, if you eat that, you can eat it, but it will cost you a couple bucks.
3467856	3468697	And you're going to go, gulp.
3468837	3470118	You're like, oh, it's just a couple bucks.
3470178	3470398	Gulp.
3472260	3473801	Look, here, hold this piece too.
3473941	3476823	It's like hotel rooms at, you know, more upscale.
3476843	3477964	I mean, obviously they don't have it at Motel 6.
3478724	3484768	But like, you know, the more upscale type motels, they'll have all the candy and shit sitting out right there on the table.
3485228	3487850	And it's like, you know, hey, if you open it, two bucks.
3489051	3491152	What a terrible thing if you brought kids on the trip.
3491212	3492413	So, you know what I do?
3492673	3494674	I go to a grocery store down the street and buy me a bottle.
3494894	3495755	That's what you gotta do.
3496395	3497476	Alright, sorry, tangent.
3498437	3499557	What are we without our tangents?
3500078	3500498	That's right.
3502216	3508400	I was just going to say I want a service on Xbox Live where I can pay for a pizza with Microsoft Points.
3509301	3509921	Slash pizza?
3510722	3512523	Yeah.
3512623	3514204	Why shouldn't I be able to get... Wait!
3514725	3517426	I bet that type of stuff is only a matter of time away.
3518287	3518988	Only a matter of time.
3519028	3523371	I want to be able to stop, pause my game for a second, order a pizza.
3523871	3527974	I guess I could just call up a pizza place and play the game at the same time.
3527994	3529675	We're talking about integration, so why not?
3530956	3534697	But once you get sick of pizza, I mean, I worked at a pizza place.
3534737	3535718	No, I don't get sick of pizza.
3535738	3537278	This is why I love internet TV.
3538099	3543340	You know, because me and every, I've made it perfectly clear, I hate being a slave to my television.
3544141	3551003	I hate having to, and you know, I don't see any money of paying for a DVR when I can just go online and watch whatever.
3551023	3552664	You want to hear something that's going to be really bad?
3553224	3559066	Wait till Spore comes out and they have that service where you can create your character and then get a figurine of it.
3560019	3561100	Oh my god, that looks awesome!
3561340	3563581	Figuring, figuring, figuring!
3563841	3567463	And they deliver this giant crate of figures for your house.
3567923	3569404	Nope, I actually would do that.
3569464	3574006	But then again, I also go back and have drawn fan art of my PSO character in the past.
3574627	3577608	I'll do it too, and I like crappy things made by me, that's why.
3580029	3583171	Hey everybody, pay me 20 bucks and I'll draw your RPG character.
3583191	3585012	Did you have another thought you were trying to finish, Jamie?
3585052	3585372	I'm sorry.
3589664	3595706	I love this comment from RossDLUT in regards to the pizza being sold on Xbox Live Marketplace.
3596026	3600627	But then the pizza would be DRM protected and you'd not be able to eat it if something went wrong before it got delivered.
3600647	3601308	I remember what I was saying.
3603508	3609190	What I was saying is that as long as you have a computer near you, anything is convenient.
3609210	3614251	Because like I was saying, I don't watch TV, but I'll watch whatever I can on the internet and do all of my other stuff.
3614707	3614967	Better.
3634400	3635120	Go out and get it.
3635280	3648386	Better yet, you order like Pizza Hut or something like that because, you know, they're kind of affiliated with, I know, I know, I'd prefer Roundtable, but that's regional and, you know, Pizza Hut, they did the whole affiliation with, you know, Xbox and stuff like that.
3648886	3655469	So you order like a Pizza Hut pizza and they have a card from Microsoft Points taped to the top of the box.
3655869	3658290	And that'd be cool, like, you know, 500 points or something like that.
3660424	3661405	Pizza Hut Outfit Pizza in Game
3680506	3681246	That's integration.
3681306	3684508	They need to hire us as marketing consultants.
3684748	3687429	I want to bring a soundboard with us to all games.
3687489	3687969	What do you think?
3688209	3690790	You think Bobby would love that, if we take a soundboard with us to all games?
3690871	3691791	That would be fantastic.
3692451	3694812	And hey, Gerardimo, Papa John's got me through college.
3694952	3697153	I think we need an actual soundboard first.
3698134	3698754	We'll work on it.
3702406	3707451	I just don't want to go crazy with it, because I don't want to go crazy with a soundboard, but sometimes it's just too good.
3707951	3709933	Alright, anyhow, sorry, back to video gaming news.
3710634	3716779	Well, actually, I wouldn't say this is gaming news, Morris, it is gaming rumor, that is big, big rumor.
3717440	3720663	Apparently the achievements for Grand Theft Auto 4 have hit the internet.
3721423	3726148	Two different websites have posted the 50 different achievements that are supposed to be in the game.
3727349	3736096	Some of the achievements are supposed to include things like hidden packages, doing types of stunt jumping, completing certain mission, beating minigames.
3736937	3738758	Some of the other features, though, are a little weird.
3739619	3741841	Here's some sample achievements.
3742682	3744743	Manhunt will get you 15 gamerscore.
3745064	3748466	Complete the most wanted side missions from the police computer.
3749808	3750668	Warm coffee.
3751229	3753711	Successfully date a girl to be invited into her house.
3754767	3758330	If that's true, that's a pretty bold achievement.
3758730	3759591	Warm coffee.
3761893	3763774	Let sleeping rock stars lie.
3764415	3765436	10 gamers score.
3765776	3768418	Kill a rock star developer in a ranked multiplayer match.
3769579	3770099	I can see that.
3770940	3772641	There's been a couple games that have things like that.
3773302	3774743	Kill the creator or something like that.
3774763	3775924	That would be sweet.
3776224	3776544	I don't know.
3776604	3778606	I mean, they kind of sound legitimate.
3778686	3779827	I think it's legit.
3779967	3781568	The gamer...
3782691	3783151	and DarkSakura.
3808379	3810140	We kind of knew a lot of that stuff was coming, though.
3810380	3810580	Yeah.
3810720	3814102	Because, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City had a lot of that video stuff.
3814122	3817304	It's going to be awesome, and when this game comes out, I'll just have to become a hermit for a while.
3818045	3818745	Nice knowing you.
3822127	3834595	Well, a lot of people, you know, have been waiting, you know, for the Gran Turismo 5 prologue, but they're going to have to wait even longer for the actual thing, because they're saying it's still about a year away.
3836216	3836376	So...
3837992	3845254	If you want any type of Gran Turismo 5 at all, your best bet is to get the Glorified demo on April 17th.
3845934	3855336	My problem with the fact that this game is a year away is, assuming that they're using the same engine, and I hope to God that they're not by the time we get around to that, it's going to be so outdated.
3855436	3861777	By that time, you're going to have Forza 3 and so many other games that do what they do a lot better.
3863157	3863557	I don't know.
3863597	3865938	It's just kind of not worth it at this point.
3866778	3876808	Why does it take them so long to model cars when, you know, fucking Project Gotham and all these other games, you know, have cars that look good as well, and they're well modeled.
3876908	3880312	I don't understand what's taking them so long to get this game done.
3880652	3882774	It's like everyone seems to be doing it a lot faster.
3883114	3884676	That's a quote Hippo asks in chat.
3884696	3887879	He says, why the hell do these Gran Turismo games take so damn long?
3887899	3889541	Does it take that long to sample engine noises?
3890140	3901026	I mean, the game looks good, don't get me wrong, but it's just, it's not that much better than, like, Project Gotham or Forza, I mean, or even there's, like, Grid coming out that looks pretty awesome.
3902487	3917676	I just, I don't see what, you know, they're putting a lot of time in, you know, it's kind of like Duke Nukem Forever type, I mean, not so bad, but, you know, Duke Nukem Forever, they're putting all this effort and time into it, and then by the time it comes out, it's just going to be kind of, it'll be good, but it won't be, like,
3918553	3921914	Whoa, awesome!
3921934	3929176	Gran Turismo 5 I'm sure will be really big for PlayStation, but will it really be that big of an achievement?
3929216	3931057	I mean, I don't know.
3932837	3940220	I just don't understand why it's taking them so long for this game when Microsoft and other companies can push out these games really quick.
3941520	3941980	Just my thing.
3943361	3944721	Well, it's just kind of
3946292	3948475	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3965185	3965365	PSP Slim
3995741	4008194	After all, they were talking that it was going to be a 10-year life cycle for this portable system, so I can see them making some more revisions, but I think it's kind of interesting.
4008214	4012699	It kind of sucks for people that bought the Slim and the original and stuff like that, now they have to buy a third one.
4013723	4015003	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4037415	4038276	We're going to have this system.
4038356	4041518	Oh, by the way, it hasn't released yet, but we're already doing a revision on it.
4041578	4044340	And you're like, I'm just going to wait until the new one comes out.
4044780	4045561	And then no one bought it.
4046501	4050284	But, you know, I got to wonder, like, you know, Nintendo kind of does the same thing.
4050624	4057069	Yes, but at the same time, I mean, here's the only difference between, I think, the DS Lite and the PSP.
4057967	4062990	The PSP Slim, it limits you to what options you have available for you when you're playing it.
4063030	4069753	There's certain applications that you cannot use on the fatter PSP.
4069933	4074035	And also, the newer PSPs have more RAM and other stuff like that.
4074055	4075796	In short, the battery life.
4076777	4078277	No, the battery life is just the same.
4078317	4080098	Actually, I think a little bit more improved.
4080198	4084060	But the fact is that... Well, your friend's wrong.
4085001	4085281	Anyway...
4087244	4093107	So they have, you know, the DS Lite, it basically is a bit slimmer and has a brighter screen.
4093147	4094107	But that's about it.
4094507	4100790	I mean, most things that run on the DS Lite will also run on the original DS as well.
4101110	4106452	There's not anything that says, okay, you have to have this version of the hardware in order to be able to play this.
4107773	4108773	That's my only thing.
4109254	4111835	You know, there were three different versions of the Game Boy Advance.
4112355	4114276	There was that first one that wasn't backlit.
4114798	4117120	There was the second one that came out that was backlit.
4117440	4121042	And then there was the real miniature one that could go on like your keychain.
4122203	4123043	I have a micro.
4123323	4126666	Yeah, the Game Boy Advance, the SP, and the micro.
4126686	4128407	The SP was on, and then the micro, yeah.
4128487	4129948	The micro got me through many a line.
4131949	4134030	But the micro didn't do very well overall.
4134331	4135151	No, but I love it.
4135231	4139994	The only problem it sucked for is playing... RPGs or anything with text?
4140514	4142376	Well, no, even text wasn't so bad.
4142516	4144437	It was playing any type of shooter.
4147561	4148101	I don't know.
4148201	4155184	I guess it's inevitable they're going to need to update the system since they're not going to just come out with the PSP 2 yet.
4156265	4160147	But that kind of still sucks for someone that just bought the system.
4161847	4163448	You should be used to it by now.
4163468	4165589	I'm sure this PSP 3000 will be unhackable.
4165749	4167670	Completely unhackable in any way.
4170251	4178216	All right, well, let's move on to another Sony-related story, and that has to do with a much-anticipated title, Metal Gear Solid 4.
4179057	4190444	The pre-order DVDs are shipping, and they come with that Metal Gear Online beta keys, and it does announce that the beta is going to begin on April 21st.
4190524	4199490	You can download the Metal Gear Online beta on April 17th, so I guess they're giving a little bit of time so that maybe the servers don't all get hammered at once, which probably isn't a bad idea.
4200423	4202525	May 5th is when the beta runs until.
4202885	4204566	So that actually isn't a whole lot of time.
4205567	4211350	I forgot I downloaded, well I haven't quite downloaded it yet, but I'm in the Battlefield Bad Company beta.
4212311	4213552	Which I hear wasn't very good.
4213932	4216634	But I still haven't got a chance to play it yet.
4216814	4219335	But hopefully next week I'll be able to talk about it a little bit.
4219395	4221757	But that was another one that was interesting.
4222540	4225142	I'll be very curious to hear from some of our listeners who are in on this.
4225562	4234807	I haven't ordered this because I don't really follow Metal Gear Online quite rapidly, but I'd be really curious to hear from some of our fans how this goes, how the online beta is.
4236188	4241271	I'm sure there will be plenty of YouTubes and all that stuff, but I like to hear the first-hand experiences.
4242518	4249744	Well for our listeners in Europe there actually may be an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 out by this summer.
4251125	4264074	Right now there's only the 40 gigabyte version but there is a little bit of talk going around that indicates there is going to be an 80 gigabyte model coming out.
4264795	4270179	And so far Sony isn't really doing a good job at saying no about it so maybe it is.
4272958	4277020	and there's actually no comment if it's going to even be backwards compatible or anything else good.
4277881	4282003	I'm going to guess and say it probably will be as backwards compatible as the 80s over here.
4283163	4285725	Now my question for Europe is, do you want it?
4287526	4288826	I mean, do you really want it?
4289747	4301513	Here would be my thing for Europe, okay, they just announced that they're going to release the 80 gig system there and I mean, they're kind of doing a new one for us with the Metal Gear Solid bundle and I know the same thing in Japan but
4303123	4309087	If you just wait a few more months, I will bet you anything in the fall they will announce yet another SKU.
4309408	4315112	So, you know, just like we were talking about before with the PSP and stuff, just wait a little longer.
4315772	4322758	I mean, because unless there's something you really need to play right away, you can probably wait a few more months for the better games to be coming out towards the falls.
4323378	4328882	And by that time you can get probably a newer system with better features for either the same price or less.
4329042	4332525	So, that would be my recommendation.
4334505	4359451	another game you should definitely wait on buying is Eye of Judgment and actually the Eye of Judgment expansion has been having some delays coming to retail and the reason for this Sony says is transportation issues so they're having some problem I guess getting it from Wizards of the Coast to retailers
4361348	4363310	I've Judgment, Byleth, Rebellion 2 Trading Cards
4387106	4393590	and they have yet to set a new launch date for the software and cards but plan to do so in the near future.
4396212	4396772	That's okay.
4397252	4401135	Everyone can buy the expansion because there's not a lot of people that own the game.
4401555	4404057	I wonder if anyone at Wizards of the Coast has heard of the Loki bit.
4405077	4406158	Does anyone really care?
4407018	4407659	Sadly, yes.
4407719	4409280	A lot of our listeners seem to care.
4410681	4411521	I don't know what it is.
4412382	4414543	But Wizards of the Coast couldn't give a rat's ass.
4415324	4415884	Probably not.
4417572	4418153	Let's see.
4419295	4422542	Eye of Judgment plus Let's Ride Friends Forever equals Tingle.
4422902	4426650	Cheeseburger's a reminder that we also get to count the sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever.
4426670	4428313	Yeah, all five of those.
4429967	4430328	All right.
4430388	4434672	Anyhow, one more story for you guys, this segment, before we get into the classic game of the week.
4434752	4439096	And those of you guys that remember the good old days of OLR, you can appreciate this.
4439156	4447544	And something that was alluded to a little bit earlier, there is now a Pichi slot machine, which really kind of looks like a slot machine to me.
4448025	4452209	And, oh, I was going to play the video for you guys, but it just got the smackdown taken off of YouTube.
4452329	4453330	I've got another one.
4453829	4454810	That's alright, don't worry about it.
4455830	4457571	Video doesn't do very good over the radio anyway.
4457872	4465096	But basically what happens, I watched it earlier, it looked like a slot machine to me, like one of those more video slot machines you'd see in the casinos.
4466116	4471180	Basically, when the slots come down, when certain symbols come up, you play like a Beatmania bonus game.
4471760	4476583	And you use the buttons on the thing to control Beatmania.
4477503	4480345	And you know what, there's something else that's kind of cool.
4481126	4482947	That's not the only game that's gotten a...
4484640	4485400	Ridge Racer
4503257	4503577	Foxhunt Foxhunt
4533393	4533733	DarkSakura.com
4555632	4559736	I bring up slot machines and all that because you know Konami makes a lot of slot machines.
4559776	4562279	Even the ones you see over here, they make quite a few of those slot machines.
4562319	4564281	It's like another business of theirs we never really talk about.
4564341	4568545	So I see many of their franchises go into those slot machines and Apache slots.
4570067	4571228	I mean, honestly.
4571248	4571989	Yeah.
4572729	4572930	So...
4574645	4576766	DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week
4600999	4612649	Well, this is actually one of my favorite RPGs ever, except honestly, it's actually one of the few that I've played quite a bit through in Japanese, until I had a little problem playing through it.
4613289	4622337	The game is Grandia, which is one of the pinnacle, I would say, of Sega Saturn role-playing, you know, for their RPG series.
4625039	4625499	Also...
4627265	4641394	It did have quite a few sequels, one of them notably being Grandia 2 that was on Dreamcast that I remember bringing up on the show years ago because I thought it was cool that my Japanese save file worked on the US version.
4642354	4644276	Because I was like, I put it and I was like, where am I?
4644696	4646277	I don't know what anybody's talking about.
4646917	4648959	So anyway, Grandia is...
4650996	4651836	Thank you for watching!
4663576	4664917	and so it'll follow with you.
4664937	4668060	Just a word of warning, the camera works so much better in the Saturn one.
4668460	4683592	You also get much more of the playfield open than you do with the PlayStation one, which is actually, the 3D looks better in the Saturn one, which is completely baffling to me, you know, since the Saturn didn't have, you know, that tremendous of a 3D processor.
4684507	4686428	You also have a compass to show you where you go.
4686448	4687929	You get treasure chests inside.
4688729	4690930	A fun story to it, too.
4691430	4696872	You also have skill points that you use to learn your abilities.
4697233	4700394	And you have a rotational roster for your characters.
4700834	4702855	You can pick different ones to have in.
4702875	4707117	There are different types of weapon classes, like swords, maces, whips.
4707777	4708558	That sort of thing.
4709518	4715702	And you actually learn your magic as you go through the game by recovering these mana eggs.
4716343	4717523	It's pretty cool.
4718004	4719845	The combat system though is what I like best.
4720025	4721226	Rob, you played Evolution, didn't you?
4722707	4722867	No.
4723207	4723787	I thought you did.
4724688	4727530	Well, Evolution is another game art title.
4728350	4732133	But the way that the combat works in here is that it's on...
4733354	4735137	Well, you can... It's like in Chrono Trigger.
4735177	4736579	You can see the enemies on the screen.
4737520	4739503	If they see you, they'll rush towards you.
4739963	4745671	Or, you know, you can try to avoid them and they'll run into you, but then when you're in combat, it goes overhead.
4746493	4748095	And it has...
4750848	4755652	I look at it more of as initiative-based, you know, like if you were playing D&D or something.
4756672	4761136	And everybody has their own sort of speed that their initiative moves at.
4761716	4765519	So you'll have your slower characters taking longer, your faster ones being faster.
4766280	4769702	And you choose your attacks as you're going through.
4770403	4774806	And then when that turn comes up, they'll hit and then the enemy will go back and forth.
4774906	4775767	It's pretty...
4776638	4781508	I'd have to say it's fairly more realistic than the turn-based style for Final Fantasy games, if you know what I mean.
4782450	4783833	And Rob, you're watching it, what do you think?
4784775	4785536	It was very interesting.
4785916	4787277	I've always heard a lot about this game.
4787337	4789038	It's just one of those games I just never got around to playing.
4789058	4795223	Because, you know, there were a lot of games, especially this was the period when I was in college, so I didn't play a lot of games.
4795243	4798426	That was kind of the one time in my life when I wasn't as into video games as I was the rest of it.
4799346	4800647	But it looks like a lot of fun.
4800687	4805571	And I want to say a sequel of Grandia's is available on GameTap, I want to say.
4805591	4806872	I want to say, like, Grandia 2 is on there.
4806932	4808033	Grandia 2 was a good one.
4808073	4812837	Then there was a Grandia 3 and I think a Grandia Extreme, which I haven't played the latter ones.
4813437	4813638	But...
4815260	4815840	Nothing to me.
4815880	4818382	I mean, Grandia is probably up there in my list.
4818742	4826165	This would actually, I even like this better than Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VI, if that's an indication of how much I like it.
4826225	4828946	The way I got my Saturn version was very fun.
4829487	4833769	Because at the time I got my Saturn version, they were going for about $80 to $100 a piece.
4834289	4836730	I bought one for $15 that said the discs were damaged.
4837070	4838711	Sounds like I'll just rip them and re-burn them, right?
4839484	4856769	Um, so, I, I, this is at Anime Expo, probably the last year I went, and I was going in to watch the Utena movie, and ended up just sitting out in the hall waiting for it to be over, and as I sat and tried to clean the discs, um, I realized that it was, the discs weren't scratched, they actually had stuff on them.
4857550	4862431	So I cleaned off the discs, it was just like, it looked like, like hot glue.
4863831	4867733	And cleaned it all off, and lo and behold, I had perfect copies for 15 bucks.
4868553	4868773	Nice.
4869384	4873146	And like I said, this did have a PlayStation release that is not nearly as good.
4873246	4877749	However, the only way you can play it in English is on PlayStation.
4877909	4880370	And I warn you, it is highly, highly censored.
4880630	4882851	Especially the part where they go in the bar.
4884132	4887694	So, it's really, really good.
4887954	4888755	I say give it a try.
4888775	4892737	Alright, your classic game of the week, boys and girls, Grandia.
4893729	4901254	which is a series I know a lot of people really have a lot of love for so I'm sure that's not going to be disputed by many as a classic game.
4901474	4904657	Oh, real quick though, I do have the series.
4905377	4912662	It was Grandia 2 and Grandia 3 and then the spin-offs were Grandia Digital Museum which is basically a bunch of artwork and voice files and stuff that went with it.
4913463	4918707	Grandia Parallel Trippers and Grandia Extreme and Grandia Online which I'm going to play Grandia Online.
4920128	4920628	Sounds like fun.
