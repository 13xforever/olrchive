13926	25013	Tonight, March 2nd, 2008, Metal Gear Solid 4 gets dated and bundled, Mario Kart Wii also gets a date and online texting, and could the game Road Rash be making a comeback?
31960	36465	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36505	43132	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43512	48457	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura.
48998	49198	Hi.
49578	50960	How are you, Miss Dark Sakura?
52261	54183	I'm well.
54522	55043	You're well.
55343	55783	That's good.
56264	57045	Yes, I'm well.
57285	57725	You're well.
57986	58286	All right.
58946	61929	I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well.
62490	63811	I'll explain why momentarily.
64172	64432	Okay.
64492	66995	But first I have to introduce the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
67635	67976	Hello.
68296	69077	How are you doing, Loki?
69217	69477	Good.
70078	70358	All right.
71041	72822	Sorry, I don't have anything extra for you tonight.
99835	101116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
122751	129954	And you ran it to the old router, and then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that.
130514	135476	So it's bouncing wireless to the router, to my laptop, wireless to the other router.
136857	150882	So right now, Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam, which is back this week, hi guys, is going through this router that goes through Loki's computer that goes to the router in the house, which goes to Comcast and the internet.
151062	151263	Yeah.
151763	152243	Amazing.
153621	156582	This is Uber Geek Tech Talk here on Orange Lounge Radio.
156602	157702	It's like a wireless orgy.
158122	158382	All right.
158782	164363	And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program.
164403	168424	I have something for Jamie, and it's actually her birthday present, and it's like six weeks early.
168584	168824	What?
169164	172665	Yes, I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early because it's something you have to prepare for.
172905	173145	Okay.
173385	174345	So I'm going to give this to you.
175126	180767	Plus, I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week, so I think this is a good time for me to give this to you.
180987	181267	Okay.
181507	182027	So here you go.
182768	182828	E!
182848	182868	E!
208117	208918	That's like close.
209038	209738	That's third row.
210619	211599	Third row tickets.
212160	213440	So quite excited.
213901	214621	Yay.
214761	215522	Oh my God, where is this?
216162	216482	Davis.
216803	216963	Really?
216983	217783	So it's not that far at all.
217803	218704	Cool.
219264	219744	There we have it.
220265	221786	So mark that date on your calendar.
221806	223187	It's May something something.
223407	224648	I'm doing that right now.
224848	225088	All right.
225108	226089	Happy, happy, happy.
226389	226709	There you go.
227904	230465	So I thought that would help after a poopy week.
230525	233666	And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else.
234046	235266	So I knew I had to tell you.
235346	237307	Or get tickets independently somehow.
237407	238447	I didn't even know.
238988	239688	I didn't either.
239808	240908	I got an email about it.
241468	242569	So there you go.
242609	244449	And I know Jamie loves the Margaret show and I do too.
244489	245309	She's pretty funny.
246270	248370	Hopefully she's not quite so political.
248450	250271	I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes.
250351	253332	But, you know, she's still somebody I like.
254372	255033	Yes, me and you.
255413	255873	Cool.
256053	256293	All right.
257884	258704	There should be two there.
258724	260045	I was like, okay.
260425	263947	I thought so because I was like, why, okay.
264227	265128	No, you have to take me.
265188	265588	I'm sorry.
265608	266008	Of course.
266569	267049	Of course.
267069	268029	No, this is so cool.
268910	269490	Thank you, Rob.
269610	269830	All right.
269850	270311	You're welcome.
270771	272872	Now we can get to talking about video games, yes?
273972	274153	Yeah.
274273	274533	All right.
274853	275773	So we're done with Tech Talk.
275793	277014	We're done with Oprah.
277434	280136	Now let's talk video games.
280196	282377	How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
284018	285679	My gaming week was...
288135	293319	Well, it was interesting because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2.
294360	298183	I picked it up and then I had other stuff to do because I watched Tron earlier in the week.
299204	300285	I was like, I love Tron.
300305	303087	I want to play Kingdom Hearts because of the whole Space Paranoids level.
304368	312275	And there was a lot of burnout and I watched Dan play a lot of burnout and I played a lot of Ragnarok.
314517	314857	That was it.
317981	318361	Alright.
319902	321482	Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?
321902	322883	My gaming week was okay.
323323	329145	I played, I actually picked up Poptapon, and I've been playing quite a bit of that.
329185	330766	In fact, that's what I was playing before the show.
331806	332266	It's fun.
332746	333307	It's different.
333487	333927	I like it.
334267	334567	I don't know.
334787	339969	It's very easy to play, but I guess it takes some time to build up your armies and stuff.
341448	350491	Then I played and actually purchased N Plus on Xbox Live Arcade, and that game's just as fun as the original N, so thoroughly enjoying that.
351571	370136	And I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week because we were having this party we have at the end of every month for our work, and this one happened to be leap year themed, and so they wanted Frogger, and they used my system to play Frogger, so I got to play some of that because no one else was touching it.
370996	375760	And then, um... I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey.
376240	377721	So, that's actually pretty cool.
377741	381765	I finally got to the point in the game where one of the characters dies.
382425	391312	You know, not necessarily a main character, but I was just very surprised on how, you know, everyone makes that argument of, like, video games being art and stuff.
391392	396596	Well, shit, I think there's a perfect example right there of how powerful they can make the story.
397017	397837	And it was pretty cool.
398257	399919	Um... So...
400598	402839	I'm about 11 hours into it now.
403359	404439	Still on the first disc, though.
405420	406940	And just taking my time through that.
407960	413142	And pretty much that's it, I guess, other than, you know, the usual Saints Row.
414423	417784	But no one wants to hear about that.
419044	420665	For the five billionth time?
421085	421305	Yeah.
421765	421945	All right.
423055	427918	Well, let's see, my gaming week, I also played Lost Odyssey, and I had much of the same experience as you did.
428218	435202	I got to the second disc, which means you kind of go through some big plot twists in the first event, or first disc, let's put it that way.
435642	440625	And I'm amazed by the game, and I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flack as it has been.
441045	448449	Although, you know, I do understand some of the little complaints about the game, and even one of them I find to be kind of annoying, and that is lack of save points.
448949	450210	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
475754	477816	And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour before I get to the save point.
477836	478136	I don't know.
478156	480118	It auto-saves, too, for some things.
480198	480919	Some things.
480959	482240	There are checkpoints, I guess.
482420	483201	Yeah, but not a lot.
484482	488266	I haven't had that problem with save points, but I don't know.
488286	489847	What do you think about the difficulty of the game?
490848	491669	It's not that difficult.
494948	497010	Some of the boss battles were surprisingly tough.
497930	503155	If you grind some of the way through there, because a lot of this game seems like it's very quick.
503595	508759	There's certain areas in the game where there's two or three sections of the map and then that's it.
508919	512202	And then you're on to the next section of the world or whatever.
512762	514504	It's very small.
515184	518147	But, I don't know, it wasn't that difficult.
518187	521810	You just grind a little bit and get your characters leveled up and
522543	523244	and it's pretty easy.
524125	533293	Also, I have the pre-order bonus so I have an item that gives me level 2 guard or whatever so I can block most of the shots and it does zero damage to me.
533354	534935	Nice, I don't have that.
535596	537478	That was something you got for pre-order, huh?
537698	537878	Yeah.
538339	540180	Hopefully they release that as a download thing later.
540200	541722	It'll probably come later on.
542062	544704	Let's go over to the chat room, because we always have the chat room has their own comments.
544744	546105	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com.
546686	549968	RawSteelUT says, it only sucks when you die an hour without a save.
550328	556013	Kind of true, but there's also some things where you go through cutscene, cutscene, cutscene, and then you have to fight a big boss battle.
556193	567582	So, I mean, I know you can skip cutscenes, but even then, sometimes you have to sit there, because some of the cutscenes are rendered with the game engine, so you have to kind of sit there and press A, A, A, A, A, A. You can also, you can pause it.
568445	570406	and HitTheBackButton for the cutscenes.
570446	573967	But what about the ones where they're actually talking to each other with the dialogue boxes?
573987	574848	You have to A-A-A.
575948	576708	I don't know.
576808	578229	Oh well, it doesn't matter.
578529	583831	It's honestly just a tiny little blemish in what is otherwise a magnificent game that deserves to be getting more attention than it is.
585372	588633	As far as other games I've been playing this week, I have been playing Super Smash Bros.
589514	592755	Brawl because I was...
593294	593955	Thank you for watching!
608155	612098	Obviously, last week I was sick on the show, and I'm happy to report I'm better.
612158	615361	I did have a sinus infection, so I had to go to a doctor and antibiotics and blah, blah, blah.
615641	618924	But Loki lent me that as kind of like a get-better-soon type thing, which was very nice.
619224	621326	He said I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time.
621366	623107	I didn't actually hook that thing up until, like, Friday.
623127	626430	That's exactly why I loaned it to you, because this is exactly what I'm doing.
626470	627671	I'm not playing Smash Bros.
628792	631014	Well, I mean, even before Smash Bros.
631034	633876	Brawl, I never played Melee very much.
634656	636458	Maybe once at a friend's house, you know, and
637085	638667	The first Smash Bros.
638787	640289	I didn't even touch.
640350	641571	So, I don't know.
641611	643994	It's not really my type of game.
644575	646478	It's fun, but, you know.
647754	649796	I may pick up the US one.
649856	651858	I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not.
652618	656562	Gerardimo in chat says, Rob, do you think Brawl lives up to the hype even if it's not in English?
658003	658464	Kind of.
658504	659264	It's hard to tell.
659685	665270	I don't feel right giving a fair review on a Japanese game when I don't understand how to get into some of the modes and look at the extra stuff.
665530	665870	It does.
667532	668773	Loki has no problem answering that.
669093	671976	The parts I've seen so far feel like
672839	701873	Smash Brothers Melee 1.5 a little bit because it's like the same kind of engine, the same stuff with just some new characters but I realize that's not being totally fair in saying that because I haven't looked at everything outside of just the brawling but it does seem like there's a lot of the stuff they just copied right on over from the GameCube version so very interesting Frisbee says Halo 3 feels like Halo 2.5 it's a little bit that I don't know how to say it but that's what it is
702805	704046	So that was my gaming week.
704727	711894	So if that's everybody's gaming week, then we will move on to talking about some news, but first some housekeeping, of which we have nothing special of note.
712435	712715	What's that?
712775	714137	We do have something special of note.
714177	715058	What's that?
715098	718561	The award contest thing that's going on through all games.
718581	719943	That's like three months old.
719983	721424	I can't believe you just saw that.
722165	723246	I did just see that.
724147	725949	Hey, I don't read, you know.
727386	727947	I didn't even notice it.
747617	751240	It's all games which our show runs on.
751280	752501	We syndicate on their network.
752521	757044	They play us Monday nights at, I want to say, 5 o'clock Pacific or 5.30 Pacific.
757124	758305	It kind of bounces around a little bit.
758986	760467	And then Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
760487	764290	I don't think... No, no, because they do their regular all-game show at 10 now.
764330	765951	So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings.
766252	770095	But I know our show is syndicated on their network, Mondays and Tuesdays, supposedly.
770135	772877	And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard as...
773337	776840	and Tiger Claw says Sky they still haven't announced the winners so I guess it is ongoing for three months now
803427	808509	So, and TigerClaw, I know, listens to all games like every other day or every day, so I know he would know what's up.
808529	808869	I don't know.
809169	812150	I voted for us, so.
812310	815631	Well, I appreciate the support, I guess, for yourself.
815991	821132	I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby, but he bought a knife judgment and I can't support that kind of behavior, so.
821152	822073	That's most unfortunate.
822393	823533	Yeah, it is unfortunate.
823893	825054	He also dropped out of the race.
825194	825614	Oh, did he?
826534	828095	As of, like, yesterday, so.
828135	829195	Didn't want to play that game, huh?
829850	830210	I guess.
830350	830630	All right.
830650	833651	Well, if you want to throw us a vote, it's over on forums.allgames.com.
833751	835851	I will plug the other stuff I know we always got.
835891	841592	We have our live journal community at Orange Lounge, our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio, and our Facebook is the OLR.
841632	843593	Be sure to look us up on our social networking sites.
844073	845753	Meet other OLR listeners.
846093	849734	Look at our posts and clips of the show we have on some of those places like MySpace.
850234	850714	Tons of fun.
851515	851695	All right.
851715	852755	Let's get into the gaming news.
852895	853515	Loki, take it away.
853888	861495	Okay, so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week from Destination, PlayStation, the retail-only conference thing or whatever.
862516	864778	I couldn't go, but other people from my company did.
865098	865498	Bastards.
866239	869382	And, of course, you know, some of the news that leaked out.
869482	871784	Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date, finally.
872324	873926	It's officially coming to the U.S.
874086	875367	on June 12th.
876348	880932	And that, of course, not only was leaked out, but confirmed by Konami.
881738	903319	and they also said that if you reserve your copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 starting April 2008 you get Metal Gear Saga 2.0 a DVD to catch you up on all the stuff that's going on in the series as well as a beta code for Metal Gear Online and then to coincide with that and this
904269	928575	I don't know if this is going to be the official, you know, remember because the 80 gig skew for the PS3 was being phased out, well there's a new 80 gig skew now, same price, but you get Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3 controller, all for $4.99, which is not a bad deal at all if you don't have a PS3, because I know a lot of people would be buying a PS3 for that, and it's nice that they're actually throwing in the DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that separately.
930461	935965	No word on when that's coming out, but it's supposed to come out around the same time as Metal Gear Solid 4, obviously.
936065	938526	So, June 12th and on, I guess.
941048	941428	Alright.
942549	947872	Well, moving on to other gaming news, although it still has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4.
949192	950933	Actually, let me back up for just a minute.
951334	956797	Loki, how important is this news to PlayStation fans, you think?
957386	958326	I think it's very important.
958366	963348	I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than the year-old MotorStorm.
963428	969710	They needed to update that bundle anyways, because, you know, shit, that game is old now.
970090	977913	And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game to throw in there, especially now that, you know, I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with the DualShock 3 controllers.
978073	986496	Probably not the 4Dig for right now, because there's supposedly, you know, the one right now doesn't have it, and I don't know if they're going to announce a new one anytime soon.
987028	989411	But it's important.
989551	995359	I think it's actually one of the first major games for the PS3 that you can only get on the PS3.
996220	999644	And that's a little bit of fuel to Sony's fire.
1000365	1002187	Although this is the first of hopefully many.
1002968	1005972	But it hopefully does very well.
1007000	1010904	Let's say Metal Gear Solid 4 does not sell all that.
1010965	1015450	I mean, let's say, you know, obviously the game's going to sell fine, you know, at least mediocre.
1015730	1019794	But let's say the game does not sell super duper well and doesn't move all these new bundles.
1019955	1023739	Is that going to be really bad for Sony or would they get more chances?
1023919	1027403	They may have more chances, but a lot of the stuff that they're counting on is like way later on.
1028361	1050634	Killzone 2 will be another one that moves systems Resistance, Fall of Man 2, maybe Motorstorm 2 Final Fantasy XIII, that's so far off that I wouldn't even consider that anything to wait for right now for the PS3 If you're going to wait that long, you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4 But at the same time, I don't know
1051371	1052592	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1071258	1074039	I was playing with their Blu-ray player a little bit, and it was slow.
1074519	1075980	It was so slow.
1076360	1081042	And I'm sorry, I know sometimes we get the mail, like, you guys always pick on Sony, we hate Sony.
1081282	1084743	Because if we hated Sony, we would still have a PSP-oriented website.
1084783	1086004	But anyway, it's beside the point.
1087284	1089725	But seriously, it was slow and clunky.
1089745	1092126	It reminded me, I guess, but... It's just first generation stuff.
1092146	1093026	Yeah, it's first generation.
1093046	1096928	I kind of think, okay, well, the first DVD player we ever had was kind of slow and clunky, too.
1097168	1099789	I remember when I had a single speed CD-ROM drive.
1099809	1102131	Now that's slow shit right there.
1102611	1103772	Well, Rob, you know what?
1103932	1104152	What?
1104772	1106613	I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-ray player.
1106873	1107053	Why?
1107254	1108514	We got an HD DVD player.
1108894	1109275	Did you?
1109615	1110675	Did you get the one for the Xbox?
1110896	1111256	Yes, we did.
1111416	1111956	Fifty bucks.
1112436	1112717	Nice.
1113417	1114618	Oh yeah, because they're so cheap now.
1115078	1115418	Yep.
1116459	1118420	Do you think you'll get enough library of movies to go with it?
1118440	1118800	Probably.
1118820	1121181	I guess there's enough out there to justify the fifty bucks.
1123809	1125070	I don't care where else Dan gets here.
1147992	1148672	But here's the deal.
1148732	1155896	If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4, you will get guaranteed access, quote-unquote, to this limited beta.
1156016	1160279	It's a little bit reminiscent, it seems to me, like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing, I think.
1160679	1162300	So, there you go.
1162720	1168083	But I'm sure most people that would be into Metal Gear Online are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4.
1168143	1176748	This is just incentive, I guess, to get pre-orders out there, which makes sense to me that Sony would want that, because they're going to want strong numbers out the gate as much as possible to try and
1177348	1183213	Put next to Halo 3 and what I'm assuming will probably be Smash Bros.
1183273	1184414	numbers and so on and so on.
1184574	1185535	Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.
1185595	1187596	It's kind of like their day one big seller that people wait for.
1187616	1190258	It's going to be the number one game for the console.
1190318	1199905	It's just Halo 3 may have been the number one game for the Xbox 360, but I don't think it's sold that many systems.
1199925	1202728	I mean, I'm sure there's people that waited to buy a system for Halo 3, but...
1204375	1204775	I don't know.
1205456	1208158	I don't believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game.
1208218	1214463	Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems but then again, their system is still more expensive.
1214663	1229474	It's a little easier now to make that purchase now that we know that Blu-ray is going to be the high def format of choice and Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now and we know when it's coming and plus now you have Grand Theft Auto 4 as well.
1230015	1233437	There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there but
1234417	1235058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1254678	1258899	There had been talk that Metal Gear Solid was going to be ported to PlayStation 2.
1260359	1261499	That's actually not happening.
1261719	1268420	It's just that the Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection is going to be on two DVDs.
1269361	1275802	It's supposed to be out on March 18th for $29.99 over here in the U.S.
1276142	1277502	It's going to be a PlayStation 1 game.
1278282	1278862	That's awesome.
1279702	1283083	Well, I wouldn't see... I mean, there would be no point to really remake, you know,
1284239	1286043	Metal Gear Solid 4, PlayStation 2.
1286424	1290152	Maybe there were people that were hoping that some of the... Because you know there was the GameCube one.
1290172	1291956	Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills?
1292970	1293931	When it came out, I don't know.
1293991	1294491	I think so.
1294651	1297533	Yeah, maybe people were kind of hoping some of those extra frills would come over.
1297953	1305057	I'm surprised they didn't put Metal Gear Solid 1 and then also have VR missions as well.
1305097	1318244	Well, my theory is that they are going to, this is again just my theory, because really all the VR missions was part of Metal Gear Solid Integral, which was basically Metal Gear Solid done as a first-person shooter.
1318304	1321606	All you need to do is put in the camera control and you can play it that way.
1323445	1326946	So they could easily include the VR missions and the, I guess, integral mode.
1329366	1329606	Hmm.
1331126	1331966	Well, it's neat.
1332487	1343028	Yeah, I mean, I guess it's not too, I mean, if this, you know, PlayStation is backwards compatible and all that, you know, at least what little backwards compatibility some of them have, it's not surprising that they only need to kind of put it out there on PlayStation 1 format.
1343668	1348589	Exactly, and if I remember correctly, I believe this collection's coming out in a couple weeks.
1349249	1350990	So, should be able to pick it up soon.
1351010	1352310	And it's cheap, 30 bucks.
1352510	1352830	Very cool.
1354346	1370236	A really cool, well, not cool for me because I already own a couple PSPs, but for someone that may not own a PSP yet, you can get a brand new PSP Slim that happens to be red with a giant head of Kratos silkscreen on the back.
1370296	1375419	This will actually be replacing the Star Wars Entertainment Bundle that they've had for a while.
1375800	1377861	You can no longer get those, unfortunately.
1379008	1389377	and of course it will be coming out I believe next week with the brand new game of course God of War Chains of Olympus and some other cool stuff that will come with this entertainment pack.
1390318	1400488	It will come with a copy of the Superbad UMD as well as a voucher to download Syphon Filter Combat Ops from the PC PlayStation Store.
1401775	1403997	Now here's my only little problem with this whole thing.
1404137	1407420	Usually these entertainment packs come with a 1GB memory stick.
1407960	1414305	I have heard no mention of a 1GB memory stick with this, so yay, I can download a game to nothing.
1414345	1416387	You have to buy a memory stick separately.
1416607	1417268	Way to go.
1417648	1418028	Awesome.
1419489	1422712	This might be a bad idea, but do you think we're just supposed to assume it's there anyway?
1424033	1425794	I don't think it is, because they would have mentioned it.
1425854	1431339	It would have been a selling point, but you know, hey, surprise me, maybe it is in there, but
1432683	1444385	I'm just going to take a wild guess and seeing as they didn't mention it, and I don't think it was in the press release, although I will double check in just a second here, I'm pretty sure it does not come with a memory stick, which is kind of sad.
1444766	1448426	Now, Alpha Canogram in chat says, Loki, bigger sizes are dirt cheap.
1448566	1449447	One gig is useless.
1450387	1456308	That's fine, okay, but the fact is it's still stupid to offer a free downloadable game
1456923	1458464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1484349	1485650	to save your games and stuff.
1485710	1486830	It's completely optional.
1486890	1488651	But, I mean, come on.
1488731	1492932	God of War, Chains of Olympus, and, like, Syphon Filter and this stuff, you're going to need a memory stick.
1493233	1495994	And it's just kind of annoying that, like, you get it all home or something.
1496014	1498135	You just say you get it for Easter or something like that.
1498835	1501816	And it's like, yeah, I'm ready to play this game.
1502036	1505397	Ah, shit, I got to go drive back down to the store to pick up my memory stick.
1506878	1507198	I don't know.
1507238	1508639	I think it's still kind of cheap.
1508919	1509619	But whatever.
1509939	1514081	I mean, if that's kind of your thing, then go ahead and purchase it.
1515154	1517535	And they'll probably be limited since the last one was too.
1519456	1524119	Although I think most people that are all crazy about God of War, most of them probably already have a PSP, don't you think?
1524599	1527541	That's always what amazes me about these bundles that come out so much later.
1528522	1530863	This is also coming out in June-ish.
1531183	1532764	I mean, around that time frame.
1532784	1535325	So it's going to be three months after the game actually comes out.
1536306	1536626	I don't know.
1537246	1539308	It's cool, I guess, if you don't have one yet.
1539368	1541789	Maybe you might think about picking this up, but
1542503	1543624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1551184	1555345	Another comment from chat from AkeRipper, I think that is, A-K-E, Ripper.
1556005	1560746	It's chat.orangeonstranger.com, says, Still, one gigabyte, you don't get far.
1561086	1561606	You know what?
1561866	1567467	I'm using my 16 megabyte memory stick that came with my original PSP.
1567607	1568768	Oh, 32 or whatever it is.
1568808	1571228	I'm using the old school original one from the first PSP bundle.
1571248	1571608	You know what?
1571628	1572088	That's fine.
1572248	1573869	I mean, see, that's the thing right now.
1574169	1575349	Okay, say you can't...
1576726	1578286	Just throw in a 32MB one.
1578346	1581228	Yeah, I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later, but hey, you know what?
1581248	1587832	At least it will get you through being able to save your game of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box.
1588012	1591654	And I'm sure since those 1GB memory sticks are what, $30 now?
1591734	1595116	The 32MB one should be like $0.50, if that.
1595276	1596297	I mean, so come on.
1596597	1597858	They've got to be sitting on a bunch of them.
1597898	1599499	Just dump that shit.
1601038	1601779	Hey, I'm not alone.
1615373	1616173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1646230	1666475	Warhawk is going to let eight people meet in like a war room area prior to a match and you can make out your strategies on a sand table that's like a replica of the different levels in the game and then you go right from there into your match so kind of kind of cute and then Resistance and Uncharted basically your avatars can go into levels from those games
1667105	1670548	And that would allow you to get to parts of the game that are even completely unseen.
1671089	1675613	Now, in addition to that, Uncharted is supposed to have a 2D shooter game that's built into it that launches from home.
1676414	1678276	See, so that's some cool ideas.
1678356	1681959	That sounds fairly generous and kind of neat.
1683160	1689927	You know, I imagine the shooter is cheesy, but it's better than nothing, and it's probably kind of one of those cool little integrations.
1691244	1695587	The news about Home is very exciting and it makes me wish it would have been out a lot sooner.
1695668	1698910	But, you know, okay, if the delays are making it better, then it's hard to complain, right?
1698930	1700991	It's all part of their plan to hopefully get more momentum.
1701052	1704874	I mean, this is also stuff that they can say, look, here, Live does not have this.
1705555	1707696	You know, this is why you should buy a PS3.
1707937	1713841	They're giving us reasons now why you should own a system, which is what they should have been doing since the beginning.
1714341	1717164	Frisbee in chat says, push it back until no one cares.
1717204	1717624	Am I right?
1718419	1721581	I don't know, but the more they drop little tidbits like this, it's hard to ignore.
1722401	1725824	Yeah, but at the same time, though, it's like, you know, Duke Nukem Forever.
1726064	1726704	Come on, dude.
1726804	1731667	I would like to see a little more video of this stuff in action, not just screenshots.
1732428	1737491	You know, just because video helps you get so much more of a sense of what it really looks like than pictures.
1737751	1743394	The trophy room thing, it's kind of neat, I guess, but at the same time, I'm just like, whatever.
1743894	1747697	Like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room and see a stupid dragon from Lair.
1747717	1748057	I'd be like,
1749008	1749468	Wow.
1749988	1751249	Testament that you played Lair.
1752349	1752989	Man, you suck.
1753790	1754190	Well, you know what?
1754210	1756931	The Xbox is the same thing with the achievements.
1756991	1762933	It's like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room of achievements that they've earned during Totem Ball or some shit.
1762973	1766094	This is where I played the game for 10 hours or something.
1766134	1767615	Wow, you have dedication.
1768735	1769716	You press start.
1769896	1770816	Achievement unlocked.
1770896	1772136	Wasn't that one in the Simpsons game?
1772176	1772757	Madden or...
1774304	1774985	Simpsons, maybe.
1775045	1775725	Or Avatar.
1775785	1777286	You hit something eight times in a row.
1777887	1778968	1,000 points unlocked.
1779368	1779889	There you have it.
1779909	1782671	I don't know, Jamie, you excited about Home on PlayStation 3?
1784032	1784612	Relatively.
1784912	1785133	Yeah?
1785633	1786814	I'm excited because it's free.
1786854	1789716	If I had to pay for that shit, I'm not playing in Home.
1789776	1790697	Free is a good thing.
1790957	1791858	Free is a very good thing.
1791898	1792538	It's hard to ignore.
1792839	1794140	Then again, Yaris was free.
1795020	1795821	Ooh, that is a good point.
1795861	1796922	Touché from Jamie.
1797482	1799544	Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record...
1803940	1810982	Well, there actually is a date now for that DualShock 3 over here in the U.S.
1811002	1817284	We're getting it on April 15th for $54.99, and I don't want that for my birthday, so nobody get it for me.
1820505	1826227	But it's, I mean, it's basically the, from what I can tell in here, the six axis with vibration, so...
1828757	1831158	So basically it's the controller that should have come out the first time.
1831218	1831998	It's finally coming out.
1832138	1835278	Yeah, except for all the crappy legal problems they were having.
1835699	1836919	Wait, what was the price again on that?
1837619	1838739	That's a $54.99.
1839019	1841640	$54 for a freaking controller.
1841660	1843260	But then again, Xbox is just as bad, right?
1843280	1845521	Isn't it like $59 for their wireless?
1845781	1845521	$49.
1846001	1847801	It's the same price as their current controllers.
1847941	1848661	He rumbles $5 extra.
1848721	1848861	I guess.
1852566	1854968	Xbox 360 controllers are way too expensive.
1878894	1879214	Really?
1879534	1879855	Oh yeah.
1879995	1881275	I haven't even really played with one ever.
1881295	1889140	The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the remote and nunchuck because the remote's $40 and the nunchuck's $20 so it's $60 all together.
1889540	1889841	I don't know.
1889941	1896305	I guess maybe for some reason I let Nintendo slip by a little more and I know people want to call it fanboyism but I don't.
1896345	1896985	Here's my logic.
1897285	1905770	I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price because that controller is really kind of like the core of the system and the motion and everything but I don't know.
1905790	1906791	I guess one could argue that
1907091	1913756	It's the same thing on the PlayStation 3, so... I don't know, but the motion shit on PlayStation 3 is very, like, kind of... Last minute?
1914236	1919379	Not really last minute, but just kind of... Well, I mean, a little last minute, but just kind of useless, I think.
1919640	1921721	I like this comment from AlphaCanogram in chat.
1921761	1922622	He says, Sky, wait.
1923122	1926224	Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube was most expensive.
1927025	1929306	That's true, because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance with cable.
1929646	1933189	And if you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles, you had to get four of those.
1933269	1936111	You know, we actually still kept our Game Boy Advances for that reason.
1937016	1938597	so that we could play Pac-Man Versus.
1938617	1944299	I was going to say, I can only think of like three games that even use that feature, no, four, because Animal Crossing was one.
1945080	1948601	Yeah, Animal Crossing, Pac-Man Versus, Crystal Chronicles, and Zelda.
1948841	1949142	Zelda.
1949242	1949602	Four Swords.
1949942	1952303	Yeah, and that's really it, just a handful of games.
1953544	1955985	But Pac-Man Versus is awesome.
1956885	1961587	And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii start to see more of that stuff too.
1961607	1964388	Didn't Pac-Man Versus come out on the Namco Museum DS?
1964789	1965409	Yes, that's right.
1966954	1967314	It's pretty cool.
1975200	1978522	Random thoughts, speaking of classic collections, just kind of make me go, huh.
1978922	1985166	I was randomly at a record store earlier this week, because I was, gasp, shock and awe, buying a CD.
1985346	1986146	I know, I know.
1986767	1990089	I was actually buying a CD, and this place sells video games as well.
1990109	1991169	They sell used video games.
1991790	2000054	And I actually saw on the play, and I was actually looking at, like, old Genesis and Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything, like, really, like, cool in the retro stuff.
2000074	2000835	It was all sports.
2001355	2002236	All sports stuff.
2002256	2004057	Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL.
2004398	2005279	So that's pretty much all they had.
2005359	2008862	But one thing I noticed on the PlayStation 2 was an Activision anthology.
2008902	2010683	And I never even knew this game existed.
2011724	2015507	Because the Activision releases an anthology on every system.
2015527	2016408	They have one on PlayStation 1.
2016588	2017669	They've had one on the PC.
2017749	2018910	I actually own the one on PC.
2019190	2019931	They've had a ton of them.
2020511	2025656	I didn't realize they had one on PlayStation 2, but I just thought it was funny because I'm reading the back of the box, like all the games that are in it.
2026136	2032140	and like this is how they're selling the game is that A, it talks about you can do cool effects to the games while you're playing.
2032180	2035162	Like you can play Pitfall but it's in a cube or something.
2035422	2041446	But then the other thing, I thought it was really funny because it lists all these games and underneath that it says never before seen in an Activision compilation.
2042967	2047109	Pitfall 2 and some of these other like really obscure Activision games.
2047269	2050411	Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure but the other ones that were listed were very obscure.
2051732	2052352	Like Bridge.
2052492	2052833	What's that?
2053813	2055014	I think I'm going to order a freeloader.
2055970	2057351	Freeloader Phil Harrison Crazy Guy
2083483	2084224	Ken Kutaragi
2115535	2115915	I don't know.
2116976	2117997	But that is weird.
2118037	2121680	If it's true he went to Atari, that's kind of like... I don't know.
2121760	2123202	But maybe he can help fix things there.
2123222	2123662	I don't know.
2124082	2126024	That'd be nice to see them turn around.
2127918	2137080	All right, well, you know, with all this talk about Lost Odyssey and what a great RPG it is, sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out where they were actually really amazing.
2137180	2141401	One of them was Persona 3, and I admit I did not get to really play much of Persona 3.
2141641	2143861	I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is.
2144161	2152703	But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it, because apparently Persona FES, which is an expansion to Persona 3, is actually coming out here in the U.S.
2152943	2153123	on Xbox.
2153453	2154914	April 22nd and it'll set you back $29.99.
2156275	2164881	But the cool thing about it, now obviously this is a PlayStation 2 game, it's not in the current gen of consoles, it's in PlayStation 2, but obviously that's what a lot of people still have.
2165941	2175508	But for such a low price for such a huge game, you get both the enhanced version of Persona 3 and new bonus features and a new chapter that is apparently 30 plus hours.
2175948	2178750	So this is kind of like Oblivion Game of the Year Edition, but for Persona.
2179510	2180651	For $30, which isn't bad.
2181175	2183336	There's still pretty good stuff coming out on the PlayStation 2.
2184736	2191339	And luckily, though, a lot of the people that put out really crappy shovelware games for the PS2 have now moved to the Wii.
2191439	2194020	So you get a pretty good crowd, although there are still some.
2194260	2201062	But luckily, though, they've adopted the price point of $14.99 retail, which, you know, you can't beat that, even if it does suck.
2202463	2208145	Well, you can download a lot of games for $5, so I don't know, $14.99 still feels too expensive for me.
2208598	2212160	for a crap game, you know, Hannah Montana Goes to College or whatever the hell they put out.
2212601	2212841	What?
2213401	2213702	I don't know.
2213742	2215363	I pulled that name out of thin air.
2216503	2217384	You want to know what sad is?
2217424	2218625	I think that they would make that game.
2218985	2219666	They just might.
2219966	2220626	Patent pending.
2221207	2222207	She'd go to college.
2222247	2222868	She's rich.
2223228	2225990	I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana or the trailer.
2226010	2228492	Even if I were really rich, I would want to be fully educated.
2228912	2229192	True.
2230253	2231714	But then again, if you're, you know...
2233019	2234880	A puppet of Disney, then.
2235481	2239883	In my mind, it's a sitcom, just like Saved by the Bell went to college at one point.
2240704	2244166	I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney Channel stars need to go to college at some point.
2244226	2245387	That's their exciting new surroundings.
2245407	2246727	That would have saved Britney from her fate.
2247188	2247628	Perhaps.
2248228	2249509	Goofy goes to college.
2250950	2251390	Gorsh!
2251630	2252771	Can I read the next story, please?
2252791	2253131	You may.
2253472	2253792	Okay.
2254592	2259075	Well, Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out.
2259853	2267457	It says it'll be out in time for the winter holiday, to be politically correct.
2267737	2270659	I'm so excited that they're releasing Game On Festivus.
2273260	2273981	Decemberween.
2274581	2275842	Gives you something to celebrate.
2277763	2279744	So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?
2280244	2284547	It's island themed, which is so, you know, wintry.
2286107	2287068	That might be kind of fun, though.
2288569	2290590	I did think the first one had too much dirt.
2291531	2292871	This one seems to have plenty of dirt, too.
2292891	2294572	It's in the middle of a desert.
2295573	2296413	I'm sorry.
2297213	2298414	Too much dirt for you.
2299355	2300615	Although, you know what?
2300715	2308339	I really have to say that the artist's joystick where we got this information from are very creative.
2308959	2315682	I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon because I don't think they've done a good off-road moon racing game.
2316003	2316523	Actually...
2318163	2319723	There was Cruisin' World.
2319883	2322444	Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX?
2322484	2324244	Cruisin' World had you go play on the moon.
2324264	2325225	Yes, Cruisin' World.
2325265	2329486	And then you ran into aliens that had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub.
2330486	2331586	Mahalis in chat.
2331626	2332566	I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
2332846	2334087	We have a lot of new chatters tonight.
2334107	2334647	Welcome all you guys.
2334867	2336847	Mahalis in chat says, Moon Patrol.
2337828	2338548	Damn straight.
2338588	2339548	That's old school right there.
2339568	2340208	Moon Patrol.
2340228	2341868	That's all the moon game you need.
2342169	2344149	But Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?
2344850	2347652	Hannah Montana Goes to Her First Frat Party Hannah Montana Goes Wild
2373550	2375671	Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs.
2377311	2377991	It's inevitable.
2378071	2379692	Hannah Montana gets a podcast.
2379872	2381332	They already do crap like that.
2381392	2382673	It's called the Evening News.
2382913	2383293	There you go.
2383333	2383993	Mahalos again.
2384033	2385294	Hannah Montana goes to the moon.
2385354	2385794	There it is.
2385914	2386314	Right there.
2386374	2387994	Like two things we need right together.
2388174	2388454	All right.
2388735	2389155	Enough of this.
2389335	2391976	I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana, but it's funny.
2391996	2393356	We do not need more Hannah Montana.
2393736	2395036	We need less of Hannah Montana.
2396497	2400218	What we do need more of is more colors in PS3.
2400718	2401538	And there is a rumor.
2401558	2403319	I was just thinking that.
2404489	2404949	I know!
2404969	2405730	No, I wasn't, actually.
2405910	2407071	I can read minds.
2408252	2411074	It's a... It's a skill I learned.
2411394	2412795	Okay.
2413215	2416737	So, there is a new SKU coming out for the 40 gig PS3.
2416777	2421180	I know this for a fact, because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3, the Blu-ray.
2421360	2423102	Because Sony thinks, you know what?
2423682	2424783	Blu-ray is a winning format.
2425263	2427344	We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3.
2428485	2430546	You will just buy your own fucking Blu-ray movies.
2431807	2434149	So there is going to be a new SKU coming out.
2435265	2460881	and apparently some Circuit City employees have begun receiving their shipments of these new PS3s and on the shipping box there is a model number which is CECHH01 and for those who may remember a while back when we covered that the FCC had an item filed from Sony regarding a white PS3 while the item numbers happened to match.
2461602	2468327	So is it going to be the white system coming out to replace the black one with the Spider-Man 3?
2469448	2469708	Maybe.
2470428	2470749	I don't know.
2470769	2471829	We'll have to see, I guess.
2474731	2476452	But if that's the case, it's going to be coming soon.
2476533	2485739	Are there really people that are like, I mean, do these people really, really exist that are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3 until they release them in white?
2486573	2488074	or until they release them in red?
2488395	2489936	Or what are the colors that we talked about?
2490216	2493539	The silver thing that we talked about on other shows in other countries.
2493619	2495001	Are there really those people?
2495021	2496081	I don't think that there are.
2496942	2499184	People maybe with the DS because it's cheaper.
2499845	2505850	But I don't think color is really going to sway you on buying the system or not.
2505950	2507892	It's like people aren't going to go, you know...
2508473	2508953	Thanks for watching!
2531021	2534522	I think, with Nintendo though, it's inevitable that they're going to come out in other colors.
2535142	2536402	That is still a little crazy.
2536822	2541123	Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing, but you'll notice, whatever happened to the pink Wii's?
2541483	2542123	Whatever happened to that?
2542143	2543324	And the blue Wii's and the green Wii's?
2543624	2544284	Whatever happened to that?
2544904	2546244	They didn't need to do it, that's what I guess.
2547004	2549905	SSJ100Matt says, Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3.
2550565	2551065	Damn right.
2551525	2553266	I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3.
2554086	2554846	That would be the best.
2556687	2558968	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to join in.
2558988	2565350	We do try to keep an eye on Justin TV's chat room as well, but sometimes I have a hard time staying on top of that because that's two different chat rooms.
2565850	2566270	That's a lot.
2568111	2578995	Something you're going to be able to play on those white PlayStations would be lots and lots of games coming to the PlayStation Store.
2579015	2581976	25 old school titles have been leaked online.
2582887	2585952	by the European version of the PlayStation Store.
2586873	2590438	Well, also, there are some pretty cool titles in there.
2590578	2592141	No, there are some very cool titles in there.
2592181	2593683	That's what makes me think it's probably fake.
2594554	2595154	Crash Bandicoot 3
2623888	2631633	Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3, Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies, Everybody's Golf, Klona, Klonoa, sorry.
2632193	2633594	Klonoa is like the best game ever.
2633634	2637997	Kurushi Final, Motor Toon Grand Prix, Namco Museum 1, 2, and 4.
2638077	2639598	I don't know what happened to 3.
2640278	2649644	Omega Boost, Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4, Roll Cage, Spyro, Tekken 2, 3, Twisted Metal, Vib Ribbon, Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097.
2649804	2650505	Vib Ribbon!
2651027	2651468	Lots of stuff.
2651488	2652068	Yeah, Vib Ribbon.
2652088	2652429	Vib Ribbon!
2652449	2653109	That's pretty awesome.
2653129	2653950	That is pretty awesome.
2655412	2656453	That game is crack.
2657233	2663480	And actually, I don't know if a lot of people remember, Colony Wars is actually pretty decent as far as the space shooter goes.
2664301	2665001	They have cool borders.
2665021	2665522	That's pretty fun.
2665702	2666903	Oh, Omega Boost is awesome.
2667124	2669206	Son of Dad says, Intelligent Cube, please.
2669866	2670247	There you go.
2670849	2671969	Don't they have the PSP one?
2671989	2674130	Didn't they come out with a sequel-ish thing to that game?
2674150	2675270	Yeah, they have a couple of them.
2675390	2681092	And let's see, CrunkyBoyJr in chat says, I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared it right up.
2681512	2686314	Hey, Klonoa was a great game, but it was messed up at the end.
2688154	2690095	I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you.
2690355	2690615	Nice.
2691575	2699378	So, in other bundly news, in Europe they're going to get a pretty decent bundle, I'm going to say, that is...
2700512	2727608	The Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle And it's a 40GB PS3 I'm sorry, my apologies, 80GB Oh, sorry, they're doing two of them, my apologies I was just staring at the red box because it's, well, kind of red and black and very cool colored And it's got a silver car up on the front of it, I can't see what it is though
2728940	2741312	But they're saying that it's going to be out on, looks like March 29th, and retails for €3.99, so that's pretty cool.
2746209	2748770	I love all this hubbaloo over Prologue.
2748990	2751410	It's not even the actual game, it's just Prologue.
2751810	2755711	You know, to be honest, I think this game's going to hurt their sales for the full game.
2755891	2756191	You think?
2756211	2764573	A lot of people, like, you know, if I had to buy a Gran Turismo game, I don't think I'd buy the full one because I don't race 200 cars.
2764874	2767494	You know, there's only a few cars that I'd actually probably race.
2768194	2775036	And, you know, after I play this game, you know, Prologue, for however many months until the full game comes out, I'll probably be sick of it.
2775780	2776440	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2796032	2800834	Ross Steel UT in chat says, Loki, Gran Turismo isn't for you, it's for crazed car freaks.
2801195	2802975	There's another bundle listed on here too.
2802996	2803876	What's that?
2803936	2812120	A Blu-ray bundle, the 40 gigabyte PS3 with Spider-Man 300 and Casino Royale on March 19th.
2812540	2820263	Now that's reasonable, you know, because obviously now that Blu-ray has officially won or whatever, that's, you know, totally understandable.
2820303	2824125	There's a lot of people that are going to buy PlayStation 3s just because it plays Blu-rays and games.
2824525	2826286	You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people to do that?
2826326	2828167	Because that's how PlayStation 2 won.
2829087	2830308	Hey, I bought my PlayStation 2.
2831048	2832889	Well, actually, no, I didn't buy it as a DVD player.
2832909	2836971	I just bought it because Armored Core was coming out on it, and I love me some Armored Core.
2837711	2839212	Except they didn't buy Armored Core 4.
2839612	2839832	Whatever.
2841360	2843061	I liked what Actdeft in chat says too.
2843181	2849803	Actdeft says Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Gran Turismo 5 Introduction, Gran Turismo 5, and then Gran Turismo 5 Epilogue.
2852463	2855304	And yet, no Gran Turismo Portable for the PSP.
2855364	2857665	It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series.
2857885	2860246	It's like Final Fantasy 7 games now at some point.
2861686	2866188	And they'll have Final Fantasy Prologue with cars.
2866928	2867528	Gran Turismo...
2868793	2871015	There's different kinds of chocobos.
2873657	2875438	You get to try out different chocobos.
2875679	2878681	Well, you may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5.
2878721	2881183	There are plenty of other games to get your attention this week.
2882124	2886228	Starting things off, we have Bully Scholarship Edition coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360.
2886568	2893153	It's slightly better than, I guess, the PlayStation 2 version because it has slightly better graphics and a few more missions.
2893574	2893774	Great.
2895427	2899691	The game I teased last week, Let's Ride Friends Forever, coming out on the DS.
2900611	2903114	Worst name ever.
2903374	2907737	If you're into baseball... Or most unintentionally funny name ever, depending on how you look at it.
2907898	2909139	There's going to be two games for you.
2909499	2915524	Sony's MLB08 The Show, and that's coming on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PSP.
2915924	2921989	And then MLB2K8, coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360.
2923602	2929267	Army of Two on PS3 and Xbox 360 Chicken Hunter on the DS Imagine Figure Skater I'm almost offended by that comment.
2952106	2954287	I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to figure skating.
2954327	2955008	Yeah, exactly.
2957589	2958730	Let's see what else we have here.
2959590	2963932	Also, Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC.
2964593	2964933	Awesome.
2967134	2969876	Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week.
2970856	2974878	God of War, Chains of Olympus coming out on the PSP.
2975079	2976119	That looks pretty awesome.
2978520	2979461	Pets, Bunnies.
2981451	2989916	Super Smash Bros.

3023341	3025221	That's on DS as well.
3026082	3030263	And Homies Rollers on the DS.
3030443	3037145	That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures that you can get out of those machines for 10 cents or 25 cents.
3037165	3038165	My boss used to collect those.
3042536	3044818	I believe that's it.
3045719	3047901	Smash Bros Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week.
3049742	3055187	I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance, but maybe there's a certain audience for that, I don't know.
3055587	3056568	I will tell you what.
3057749	3058289	Uh-oh, what?
3058890	3064534	If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies... Oh no, here we go, here we go, okay, yes, yes.
3064895	3067497	If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies, yes, what?
3068343	3071366	We'll do the whole Tinkle thing and burn Eye of Judgment.
3071406	3073207	We'll need another game in there.
3073308	3073908	More of a chance.
3075129	3077031	You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?
3077631	3078732	Yeah.
3078792	3079153	Great.
3079973	3085739	The makers of that game just thanked you for selling about 100 additional copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise.
3085759	3087020	Here, I'll make it even more fair.
3087080	3090943	The combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever... Whoa, whoa!
3090983	3095007	So the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment now... Yes.
3095849	3099391	Oh, because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell 100,000 copies.
3099491	3101593	Somebody mark the date and time of this.
3101693	3105775	Oh, it's almost exactly 7 o'clock here on Sunday evening, March 2nd.
3105795	3107516	We'll never sell anything, okay?
3107536	3108137	Come on.
3108577	3110038	Well, that's something.
3110218	3111039	That's given the listeners.
3111359	3114180	That's for the little meter some of the chatters made up.
3114621	3119904	Some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that looks like a telethon thing, and it's like the road to one million copies.
3119924	3120704	It'll never happen.
3120745	3122205	Now it gives them something to add to that.
3123446	3124667	It'll never, ever happen.
3126926	3137295	Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never ever sell Here's the thing, chatroom You gotta get him to keep adding games to it until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total
3140456	3143517	Oh yes, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that.
3143577	3145557	Gold Bandra says another one for the OLR wiki.
3145637	3146818	I forgot to mention Housekeeping.
3146838	3147898	This would have been good.
3148018	3150859	They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio.
3151539	3153900	And you can wiki stuff on it.
3153960	3157501	Even though I guess... Well, we have an official Wikipedia article.
3158121	3161262	But now we have our own freaking entire wiki.
3162082	3168264	Which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really... You'd think I wrote it or Loki wrote that article, but we've never...
3169873	3171094	Really worked on that.
3171134	3173515	It was totally the fans that did that, so that was really cool.
3174656	3175917	I haven't even seen it.
3176698	3177338	On Wikipedia?
3178038	3180800	Oh, well, I thought you meant on Wikipedia.
3180820	3182681	Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia.
3182721	3183762	A wiki set up for us.
3183802	3186524	Yes, but now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki.
3186904	3188225	That's what I was talking about.
3188285	3190827	Yes, I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out.
3190887	3193649	It's orangeloungeradio.wikia.com
3196796	3197937	XBOX 360 Arcade Hits Japan
3221636	3223759	PS3, DualShock 3, Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock, Satin Silver, PlayStation 3
3238137	3239078	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3265317	3266677	So that kind of surprised me.
3267918	3271039	Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin.
3271399	3274820	And it comes with a... Online, I think.
3275100	3277460	But it comes with what's called a power-up kit.
3278181	3280881	And I'm not exactly sure what a power-up kit has in it.
3281362	3284182	So this is something they haven't released here yet.
3284202	3285743	Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games.
3286643	3286823	Perhaps.
3286843	3289764	The same thing with Devil Kings or whatever they call that over there.
3291404	3293685	I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes.
3294901	3295381	It's drugs.
3296102	3298504	Perhaps, but it does look like another version of Nobunaga's Ambition.
3298544	3301846	Dang, the last time I played this game was on the NES, and look how far it's come.
3302487	3303447	It's like Civilization.
3304548	3306330	I remember Civ 1, I have such fond memories of that.
3306350	3312074	They had a Nobunaga's Ambition game that came out at the beginning of February for PlayStation 2.
3312935	3315156	Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore.
3315196	3316597	They're too complicated for me.
3316857	3318899	I'm not smart enough to play those games, I'll admit it.
3319560	3321441	I think that's just exactly what it boils down to.
3322205	3323166	They're too much for me now.
3323186	3323926	They get too complicated.
3323946	3326847	They need a Nobunaga's Ambition party game.
3327027	3331090	Yeah, they need like, you know how they like dumbed down Madden for Wii owners?
3331670	3332190	That's what I need.
3332210	3334251	I need a dumbed down version of Nobunaga's Ambition.
3334271	3335912	Swing the remote down to Conquer Japan.
3339154	3340554	It's too bad they don't have achievement points.
3341215	3346177	And I accidentally closed out my list, so I'll tell you what, why don't we go to Europe and then we'll come back to Japan.
3346197	3347678	Well, you know what that actually makes me think?
3347718	3349999	Did we ever get a current gen release of Risk?
3352153	3352913	Not that I can think of.
3353194	3355255	But wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?
3355335	3357696	It'd be cool if we had Risk and Axis and Allies.
3357736	3358376	Wouldn't that be cool?
3358476	3359317	That would be very cool.
3360537	3361778	I love games like that.
3362078	3362298	Oh, wait.
3362338	3363559	I got the Japanese release dates back.
3363819	3364139	Never mind.
3364719	3365220	Fine.
3365620	3366780	Europe can wait a little longer.
3366800	3367541	They're used to it.
3367861	3369442	That was mean.
3369782	3370262	Hit what?
3370302	3371143	Blow the bell.
3371223	3371883	I'm sorry.
3372043	3372603	Party foul.
3372783	3375945	Dear European listeners, please send Rob a smack in the head via email.
3375965	3376805	Send me your cards and letters.
3379226	3381187	Whatever, they get Mario Kart early.
3381267	3382027	Yeah, that's right.
3382187	3383388	So, you know, shut up.
3384308	3385609	Go stuff yourself with a carpet.
3386649	3390071	Hey!
3390471	3391332	I love Britain.
3391352	3392472	I love all of Europe.
3392872	3393553	I love France.
3393633	3394233	I love Spain.
3394253	3394733	I love them all.
3395193	3395474	All right.
3396434	3401116	On the PlayStation 2, also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well.
3401456	3402217	And guess what?
3402357	3404618	As if there wasn't enough pachinko in your life.
3406431	3412054	Hisuu, Pachinko, Pachislot, Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well.
3412334	3420378	By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of Pachinko, because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that.
3421238	3424199	On the Nintendo DS, Bomberman gets a price cut.
3425120	3429782	Dorimon, Nobita Ton Midori no Kyojinden DS comes out.
3430002	3431603	In other words, it's Dorimon on the DS.
3433482	3461513	and lastly on the PSP and then I promise we can do the Europe dates Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable that is a combo kit of those games it's like an Ultimate Hits so there you have it and also Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits the Lenneth and what was the other one Slamera or whatever it was called they both move into the Greatest Hits Collection alright now that all of Britain hates me and Europe in general
3462699	3464219	Let's go to their release dates, shall we, Jamie?
3464879	3465320	Fine.
3466060	3471741	Well, these are all on the 7th, and one of them pisses me off, but I have a certain bias against it.
3472681	3490425	Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Blackside Area 51 on PS3, Bully Scholarship Edition, Xbox 360 and Wii, Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed on Wii, Dynasty Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Jack Kane on PC,
3491813	3506425	MX vs. ATV, Untamed on a bunch of crap, Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one, The Destiny of Zorro on Wii, Victorious Boxers on Wii, and the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K, Dawn of War.
3506945	3508807	Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?
3508827	3509487	Victorious.
3509887	3510708	Oh, Victorious.
3510728	3512049	I thought you said Victorious.
3512429	3515011	And I'm thinking, like, is that like Victorious Closet for Men?
3515172	3515952	Like, now they're expanding?
3515972	3517613	I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls.
3517633	3518834	You mean Victorious Secret?
3520195	3520796	She has a penis?
3521468	3523250	No, I thought you said Victoria's Closet.
3523811	3525633	That was a really crappy show.
3525653	3527875	No, it was Veronica's Closet with Christy Alley.
3527895	3530458	No, Victoria's Secret.
3530938	3533141	I thought I heard her say Victoria's Boxers.
3533281	3536184	Maybe my mind is just focused on underwear right now.
3536264	3536664	I don't know.
3537265	3541850	See, you said Victoria's, though, and I was thinking that you were bringing up Spice Girls.
3545707	3548530	and on the back of them is a big peace sign.
3548950	3550832	You know, like the V for victory or whatever.
3552253	3555596	A hand doing a V. Please, let's change the topic.
3556297	3557157	I hate Warhammer 40k.
3557177	3557257	Why?
3559969	3560950	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3585620	3610003	and that's all he ever did so yeah I broke up with him to play with you know to hang out with some guy that played Rift it was fun though running over those little figurines with a toy train because you know if you're going to build your own landscape you might as well already have a train set and landscape built already for that well I can understand having a project that's one thing but when your entire life is your project that's a little something else that and he didn't have a job yeah
3610515	3617781	Speaking about building little figurines, Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spin-offs for different games, including Indiana Jones and Star Wars.
3618181	3622825	Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo.
3623506	3632433	As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue, but they have screenshots to prove that it's real, you know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts, but...
3633854	3644099	The minute I saw a headline that said April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was, I was like, oh, haha, funny April Fool's joke.
3644139	3645040	I hate April Fool's.
3645060	3647341	Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate April Fool's.
3647461	3649002	It would be cool if it were real.
3649222	3651463	I don't think it is, and I don't think you would try it.
3651483	3651923	It's not.
3651963	3652523	Come on.
3652603	3656065	You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine, you know.
3657040	3660261	and of course it's their exclusive they say and stuff like that.
3660681	3667203	Trust me, if this wasn't a real exclusive, 1up.com would be whoring the shit out of this right now, okay?
3667243	3672204	Because they like to tease their exclusives, so whatever.
3673144	3675765	You don't need any more Halo or Lego Halo.
3677298	3678359	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3702757	3703477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3731890	3733251	and turn back into game data.
3733551	3734973	What a weird concept.
3735113	3736033	It's treasure.
3736213	3742658	The other thing you can do with this is you can put them in MP3 format or whatever and spread them out on the internet so people can download them that way.
3743539	3744099	It's treasure.
3745881	3751365	It's kind of neat, I'll admit, but when I first read this, I'm like, this is the weirdest thing I've ever heard.
3751718	3752659	Symphony of the Night CD Hidden Track
3778946	3779607	Thank you for watching!
3795334	3797615	and put it in a regular CD player.
3798156	3800777	And if you know what I'm talking about, you're old school because we did this in junior high.
3801077	3805760	We would take a copy of Encarta and put it in a regular CD player and it makes the most hideous noise.
3806080	3813023	And what you do is... It was like the dumbass joke you would play is that you would turn the radio thing up full blast, close the door and run.
3816605	3817226	Ah, yes.
3818566	3819467	I just remember...
3819912	3829617	putting them in, especially they'd also do it on PC Engine Duo desks who say, this is a game disc, do not listen to this or your speakers will die.
3830498	3831058	That type of thing.
3833753	3834934	Very interesting feature.
3835594	3844640	I have to admit, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought to go run out and buy or even really check out just because there's too many other games on the table, right?
3845001	3848423	But now I'm kind of like, I might have to look at this game just for this feature.
3848823	3851005	I'll tell you in one word why I'm getting this game.
3851385	3851565	Why?
3851825	3852265	Treasure!
3853786	3854347	I should have known.
3854567	3855427	Treasure!
3855848	3857909	There's no reason why I'm still looking for Chameleon Twist.
3858790	3860771	Alright, well, let's move on.
3860791	3862372	That's all I have to say until the game comes out.
3863055	3883590	Well, I know that quite a number of our listeners are into rock band, so something that everyone should be happy about is that there is a Grateful Dead pack coming out for a rock band that will have China Cat Sunflower, Casey Jones, Sugar Magnolia, Truckin', Franklin's Tower, and I Need a Miracle.
3884710	3888273	I think that that's pretty cool, because Grateful Dead is pretty cool.
3889150	3894394	Now, I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit, because that would be the full dead experience right there.
3894414	3894934	You know what?
3895834	3896695	You laugh about that.
3897075	3899777	Apparently, okay, one of my customers... Oh, no.
3899797	3900398	No, no, no, no.
3900458	3901378	Not about the weed thing.
3901718	3910544	No, one of my customers actually saw the kit set up at one of the GameStops, I guess, in Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from.
3911305	3911445	And...
3914090	3914631	Thanks for watching!
3925715	3927556	and they react to the sound that you do.
3927576	3931038	So we could do the show and it would react to our speaking and stuff.
3931378	3932379	Just what we need.
3932959	3933780	I'm sorry, DarkSakura.
3933820	3935461	Well, there's a little bit more to this story.
3935981	3947107	For people who are not so rock band oriented and are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented, actually No Doubt's having some releases on there, which No Doubt, cool.
3947247	3949749	Gwen Stefani solo, bad, because she sucks.
3950555	3953116	That and She's Got Mental Problems, but moving on.
3953256	3954517	Wow, tell us what you really think.
3954617	3956598	What songs are coming out from No Doubt, do we know?
3956978	3959979	Don't Speak, Excuse Me, Mister, and Sunday Morning.
3960699	3961940	So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend.
3962680	3963620	That's the song I love.
3963800	3966582	No, no Just a Girl, no Spiderwebs.
3966742	3969703	But, I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list, so I'm happy.
3970363	3970923	What song is that?
3971103	3971504	Don't Speak.
3971684	3972084	Don't Speak.
3972364	3975345	All right, let's hear some clips of these songs that are coming to Rock Band very soon.
3975365	3976906	Here's a clip of The Grateful Dead.
3976986	3978647	So if you got them, smoke them.
3979027	3979747	Just kidding, that's bad.
3985920	3999907	Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in Rock Band.
3999967	4009372	And then we have coming to, not coming to Grateful Dead, coming to Guitar Hero 3, we have No Doubt.
4009612	4014555	And I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak, so let's play one of the more lesser known songs, which would be Sunday Morning.
4034566	4038448	At least I'm glad I breathed some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band in general.
4038588	4041070	Rock Band, the wheels keep on turning with that game.
4043051	4044151	Proud Mary keep on burning?
4044171	4044711	I don't know.
4045232	4045612	Not yet.
4045712	4046232	Maybe someday.
4047013	4047313	Anyhow.
4047953	4052375	And not to be outdone, from the studio that brings you Hannah Montana...
4054879	4057622	Disney has announced a brand new game for the Wii.
4057642	4059524	Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert.
4059585	4060065	No!
4060786	4062288	It's Ultimate Band.
4062368	4064110	You know, fuck this rock band shit.
4064310	4065952	It's the Ultimate Band.
4066593	4068996	And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS.
4069817	4073582	One thing, though, that you will be happy to know, and maybe this might be...
4074548	4076408	You have one, two, zero, or both You know what?
4101793	4104154	I'm going to say something pretty daring here.
4104334	4106015	I think this actually isn't a bad idea.
4106875	4108656	Because think about who this game is aimed at.
4108756	4115218	It's aimed at kids, and parents don't want to spend all this freaking money on all these peripherals that their kids are going to destroy.
4115658	4116218	So you know what?
4116278	4120280	If you've got a Wii, why not come out with a game that's, you know...
4120934	4124876	very similar to Rock Band, but you don't have to buy all this extra shit for.
4125256	4127537	And of course, I'm not going to like it, probably.
4127617	4129097	Jamie, Matt, they're not going to like it.
4129157	4130278	It's not really made for us.
4130338	4132379	It's a kid's game.
4133039	4136140	I don't think I'd buy this game, but I'll try it.
4136600	4148225	It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays, and the DS version will have that brand new D-Gamer online social network, which is sounding pretty awesome, and I really kind of want to check it out, but
4149226	4151007	That means I have to buy a Disney DS game.
4152247	4152587	I don't know.
4153087	4155588	Actdeft in chat says, Sky speaks the truth.
4155728	4157489	And GS68 says, Sky is right.
4157609	4158449	Ego plus plus.
4160530	4163371	The chat room actually just reminded me of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming week.
4163451	4163811	What's that?
4164111	4164891	Oh, I bought Parappa.
4165612	4166072	Oh, rad.
4166852	4169653	For $15 out of Hollywood going out of business.
4171854	4172174	Let's see.
4172254	4176936	Ross Steel UT says, Sky, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the Flames will disagree.
4177236	4178196	Yeah, well, he's a freak.
4179312	4180892	Hey, did I just call a seven-year-old a freak?
4181232	4181532	Cool.
4181813	4182233	That's fine.
4182273	4182793	He's a freak.
4184433	4188194	Uni in chat says, Kids already nom-nomed the hell out of the Wii Remote.
4188934	4192915	Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii Remote and hid it under the couch.
4194795	4198916	If your seven-year-old nom-noms the Wii Remote and hides it under the couch, you've got issues.
4199136	4200136	I like that phrase.
4200156	4200697	That's funny.
4200737	4201477	What, nom-nom?
4201637	4202177	Nom-nom.
4204175	4204635	Didn't you hear?
4204956	4206197	Everything is Caturday now.
4206297	4206717	Everything.
4207979	4208639	Low-cat speak.
4208979	4209940	Crunky Boy Jr.
4210341	4213544	tries to put out a zinger here saying, you mean we save money on Wii peripherals?
4214184	4214825	Ba-dum-bum.
4215125	4215385	Get it?
4215405	4217167	Because the remotes are so fucking expensive.
4217247	4218989	They don't really have real Wii peripherals.
4219049	4223092	I mean, after all, there's like, what, the classic controller and the nunchuck.
4223132	4224253	That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii.
4224293	4225575	Everything else is plastic shit.
4229658	4230219	All right, well.
4231428	4231708	DarkSakura.com
4252388	4254330	Jonathan Coulton was up on stage with his band
4281270	4283392	DDR machines have the memory cards.
4283832	4287415	I can't think of any reason why you would put a 360 card in your pocket everywhere you go.
4287455	4289517	But whatever, it's Game Developers Conference, whatever.
4289897	4297404	So he pulls out this memory card, he puts it in, messes around, and then finally, one of the Harmonix guys walks over and says, what's going on?
4297464	4299345	And this guy says, I'm just grabbing Still Alive.
4299385	4300706	Everyone needs to be able to play this.
4301167	4303589	Well, the developer took it back and
4304302	4307045	Uh, deleted the thing off the card and, you know, all is well.
4307406	4312832	Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway, because it's probably a dev 360, and I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild.
4312852	4318398	Uh, it wouldn't have worked anyways because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management, which we'll get into later, but...
4319102	4319302	Right.
4319602	4321644	Well, apparently the guy actually wrote about it.
4321684	4330870	The only reason I'm not giving this Idiot of the Week Award or Stupid Guy of the Week or whatever we're calling it here award is because apparently the guy wrote about it in his live journal.
4330930	4332010	And I don't know.
4332310	4334432	Don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate.
4334792	4336693	It could be fanfic or some shit.
4336713	4337073	I don't know.
4337314	4338494	But I think it's legit.
4339295	4340776	You can check it out on his live journal.
4340836	4344718	It's algoromancy.livejournal.com.
4344738	4345739	That's A-L-G-R-O-M-A-N-C-Y.
4346551	4351995	O-R-I-T-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com and he writes in this entry on February 21st, 2008.
4352155	4356377	He writes his side of the story and his thing, he puts a disclaimer at the end.
4356397	4357638	He says, don't try this at home.
4357918	4367224	The only reason I did because I am an acquaintance of Alex who works at Harmonix as well as good friends with several Harmonix folks and game industry friends give each other free swag all the time.
4367284	4370686	Remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material is theft.
4371647	4371707	So.
4371727	4374409	You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?
4374689	4374869	Huh?
4375373	4375913	Thank you for watching!
4403769	4406311	Before we wrap, are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in studio?
4406331	4406571	No.
4407191	4408292	Did you hear our idea?
4408332	4411033	I don't remember if this is the week you were gone, because February was all fucked up.
4411314	4422520	But were you here the week we had the idea that when it comes out, we'll get Mo back, and she'll be our vocalist, and we'll get Matt to play drums, you can play guitar, you and I can work out the guitar somehow, and we'll have an OLR band, and we'll do our rendition.
4422540	4423141	It was mentioned last week.
4423221	4423841	Was it last week?
4424241	4424681	I can't remember.
4424701	4426102	I'm getting old, and the weeks blend together.
4426442	4427183	That's okay, Rob.
4427203	4427443	All right.
4428083	4428504	Anyhow.
4429104	4431145	I'm still bringing you your birthday present.
4431866	4432186	Sweet.
4432206	4432306	Sweet.
4433561	4434642	DarkSakura.com
4462629	4474673	is Cybertroopers Virtual On which is a 3D robot fighting game done from a behind the view of your own character who you're playing.
4475253	4476074	Let's take a listen.
4486817	4490438	And almost every other sample of it online was horrible.
4490679	4491939	So, moving forward
4492906	4507178	You basically play as a Virturoid, you know, a giant robot controlled by a person, which is actually pretty funny because their little insert things with the pilots go in the back of them like they're Saturn.
4507559	4513764	In the sequel, Virtuon, or Tario Tangram, was a Dreamcast, which I have that game too and it's awesome.
4515465	4522927	Um, but you would play as a number of them with different specialties, like you have, um, the Temjin, which is the, the balanced one.
4523687	4532269	Um, you have the Raiden, which is a heavy battle one, really strong and, you know, heavily, uh, armed.
4532289	4539710	Um, you have, uh, the Ampharm, which is, uh, supposed to be, I think, one of the, uh, fast ones.
4539950	4541490	Um, it uses a Tompo weapon.
4541890	4544211	You have, uh, Belgor, which is, um,
4545599	4561663	a missile launcher, the Dorcus, which is another pretty heavy one, the Viper II, the Fast Balbo, and my favorite, which is the Feiyen, which is like the cute little Loki mecha, which is really fast and nice.
4561803	4569185	You have the Z-Grat, and then you have the Jaguarati, which is, as far as I remember, I think it was one of the heavy ones.
4569245	4572906	But in the arcade, you had a two-person set-up,
4574071	4576873	And it had a dividing wall in between so you were like in the cockpit.
4577533	4581115	And it used two sticks to control it.
4581756	4584097	And on Saturn they did release the twin sticks.
4585038	4589880	And I actually don't have them which makes me very upset because I had a chance to get them.
4590061	4594783	They did do Oratario Tangram that was on the Dreamcast.
4594823	4596364	I actually do have the twin sticks for that.
4596684	4598245	In fact, you remember your ex-roommate?
4599726	4599946	Yes.
4600046	4600887	We beat him getting them.
4603012	4603512	Interesting.
4603953	4606694	We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento.
4606714	4607435	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
4607455	4609016	We're not talking about the one I live with.
4609376	4610276	Oh, we're talking about that.
4610296	4611677	That roommate.
4612598	4612918	Wow.
4613098	4614339	Those were the days, man.
4614359	4615019	Those were the days.
4615059	4621563	The guy who sold it to us ended up being my husband, ended up being, I do believe, Moe's manager.
4626026	4629888	You know, I know, we're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town.
4631070	4636674	But at any rate, we came in, we saw the twin sticks for $45, which was astounding at that time.
4637295	4638876	And like, we want to buy these right now.
4638896	4639616	I was like, okay.
4640157	4645841	And then a person who's, as far as I knew, his nickname came from this game.
4648745	4650626	came in and we beat them by like 10 minutes.
4651086	4652988	So there are also other versions.
4653028	4662716	There was Cybertroopers Virtual on Force that was only in Japanese arcades in 2001 and Virtual on Mars, which was the PS2 release.
4663416	4666919	So there's also an audio drama for it, which is kind of funny.
4669000	4673524	And then there was a musical one, which was the Feiyan Robot Singing Festival.
4674247	4678450	I actually have a Feiyan garage kit that I still have yet to put together that I bought like six years ago.
4679671	4679931	Nice.
4680071	4681872	Virtual On's like tops.
4683073	4683453	All right.
4684054	4684994	Well, that's going to do it.
4685034	4687556	Your classic game of the week, Virtual On.
4688322	4689102	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4717179	4717779	Orange Lounge Radio
4746400	4750482	Hi guys, it's Rob here with an important footnote for our podcast listeners.
4750783	4762730	There's no easy way for me to break the news, but Part B this week was lost, and unfortunately we won't be hitting the podcast feed, and you won't get that news, we promised, unless you were listening live and heard all two hours of it being taped.
4763130	4764911	So I'm sure you're wondering, what happened?
4764991	4770314	Well, what happened is that we were taping the show as we always do, and we do a special little show after that called The Afterbirth.
4770354	4774817	It's only for the live listeners, because we play licensed music and stuff that we can't put on the podcast.
4775410	4785997	and as we were taping that, right at the very end, we were trying to unjumble some of the cords back here and the power cord to the computer got detached and the whole damn thing shut off.
4786717	4794723	And although Audition keeps a temporary file on hand, when I went in to recover the file, I made a mistake and ended up deleting the damn files.
4794743	4797264	I was trying to make a backup copy of it and I've tried everything.
4797304	4799226	I can't get... It's not in the recycle bin.
4799246	4799326	It's...
4800302	4800863	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4822352	4823672	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4850482	4854165	In six years that we've been doing this show, we've never lost a show like that.
4854265	4861351	So it's kind of embarrassing and a little sad, especially off of a few broken weeks in a row.
4861391	4862152	But what can you do?
4862732	4863473	Life goes on.
4863833	4865274	I hope everybody has a wonderful week.
4865354	4866015	Happy gaming.
4866415	4871039	And we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week with all new power chords in studio.
4871339	4871819	Have a good one.
