7000	10000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura
10000	13000	Sky and Loco
13000	16000	Tonight, March 2, 2008
16000	19000	Metal Gear Solid 4 gets dated and bundled
19000	22000	Mario Kart Wii also gets a date and online texting
22000	27000	And could the game Road Rash be making a comeback?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	43000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
43000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura
48000	49000	Hi
49000	51000	How are you Miss DarkSakura?
51000	54000	I'm well
54000	56000	You're well, that's good
56000	57000	Yes, I'm well
57000	58000	You're well, alright
58000	62000	I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well
62000	64000	I'll explain why momentarily
64000	65000	Okay
65000	67000	But first I have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki
67000	68000	Hello
68000	69000	How are you doing, Loki?
69000	70000	Good
70000	71000	Alright
71000	75000	Sorry I don't have anything extra for you tonight, but you know, that's what happens
75000	78000	I gotta say though, very interesting troubleshooting before the show
78000	83000	We were kind of joking last week on the show that February is the month of Broken here on Orange Lounge Radio
83000	86000	And unfortunately it looked like March was going to turn out the same way
86000	91000	Because for whatever reason we have a wireless network that sits inside the house here where we tape
91000	95000	And for whatever reason just last week when we were doing the short show
95000	98000	It suddenly decided that the strength is not going to be as powerful anymore
98000	105000	And the Justin TV cam would not see, that runs off an iBook that would no longer see the WiFi network
105000	108000	And then tonight Jamie's computer decided it wasn't going to see the network either
108000	110000	So I have no idea what's going on with the box
110000	113000	But very impressed with the technical skills behind
113000	115000	What did we do? We turned your computer
115000	117000	We turned my computer into a gateway
117000	121000	So it's using my wireless internet connection
121000	125000	But I have an ethernet cable and you ran it to the old router
125000	130000	And then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that
130000	136000	So it's bouncing wireless to the router to my laptop, wireless to the other router
136000	138000	So right now
138000	139000	We'll do a piggybacking
139000	142000	Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam which is back this week
142000	143000	Hi guys
143000	146000	Is going through this router
146000	148000	That goes through Loki's computer
148000	150000	That goes through the router in the house which goes to Comcast
150000	151000	And the internet
151000	152000	Yeah
152000	153000	Amazing
153000	156000	This is uber geek tech talk here on Orange Lounge Radio
156000	158000	It's like a wireless orgy
158000	159000	Alright
159000	161000	And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute
161000	164000	Because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program
164000	165000	I have something for Jamie
165000	167000	And it's actually her birthday present
167000	168000	And it's like six weeks early
168000	169000	What?
169000	171000	Yes I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early
171000	172000	Because it's something you have to prepare for
172000	173000	Okay
173000	174000	So I'm going to give this to you
174000	178000	Plus I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week
178000	180000	So I think this is a good time for me to give this to you
180000	181000	Okay
181000	182000	So here you go
182000	184000	Open it up and see what they're tickets to
184000	185000	Okay
185000	187000	Alright and hopefully she likes it, I hope
191000	193000	Wow I know they heard this squeak on Justin TV
193000	194000	Yay
194000	197000	Tell the listeners what I got you
197000	200000	Rob got me a ticket to see Margaret Cho
200000	202000	Now in here locally
202000	205000	Now I'd also like to point out, look at where the seats are
205000	207000	Eee
207000	208000	That's like close
208000	209000	That's third row
209000	210000	Probably look up her nose
210000	211000	Third row tickets
211000	213000	So quite excited
213000	214000	Yay
214000	215000	Oh my god where is this?
215000	216000	Davis
216000	217000	Really?
217000	218000	So it's not that far at all
218000	219000	Cool
219000	220000	There we have it
220000	221000	So mark that date on your calendar
221000	223000	It's May something something
223000	224000	I'm doing that right now
224000	225000	Alright
225000	227000	Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy
227000	228000	There you go
228000	230000	So I thought that would help after a poopy week
230000	233000	And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else
233000	235000	So like I knew I had to tell you
235000	237000	Or get tickets independently somehow
237000	238000	I didn't even know
238000	240000	I didn't either, I got an email about it
240000	242000	So there you go
242000	244000	And I know Jamie loves some Margaret Cho and I do too
244000	245000	She's pretty funny
245000	248000	Hopefully she's not quite so political
248000	250000	I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes
250000	251000	But you know
251000	253000	She's still somebody I like
253000	255000	Yes me and you
255000	256000	Cool
256000	257000	Alright
257000	258000	There should be two there
258000	259000	I was like
259000	260000	Okay
260000	261000	I thought so because I was like
261000	262000	Why
262000	263000	Okay
263000	265000	No you have to take me I'm sorry
265000	266000	Of course
266000	267000	Of course
267000	268000	No this is so cool
268000	269000	Thank you Rob
269000	270000	Alright you're welcome
270000	273000	Now we can get to talking about video games yes?
273000	274000	Yeah
274000	275000	Alright
275000	276000	So we're done with Tech Talk
276000	277000	We're done with Oprah
277000	278000	Now let's talk
278000	280000	Let's talk video games
280000	281000	How was your gaming week
281000	282000	Dark Sakura?
282000	285000	My gaming week was
285000	289000	Well it was interesting
289000	293000	Because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2
293000	294000	I picked it up
294000	296000	And then I had other stuff to do
296000	298000	Because I watched Tron earlier in the week
298000	299000	I was like
299000	301000	I love Tron I want to play Kingdom Hearts
301000	303000	Because of the whole Space Paranoids level
303000	307000	And there was a lot of burnout
307000	310000	And I watched Dan play a lot of burnout
310000	314000	And I played a lot of Ragnarok
314000	317000	That was it
317000	319000	Alright
319000	321000	Well Loki how was your gaming week?
321000	322000	My gaming week was okay
322000	324000	I played
324000	327000	I actually picked up Pop Tippon
327000	329000	And I've been playing quite a bit of that
329000	331000	In fact that's what I was playing before the show
331000	332000	It's fun
332000	333000	It's different
333000	334000	I like it
334000	335000	I don't know
335000	336000	It's very easy to play
336000	337000	But I guess
337000	340000	It takes some time to build up your armies and stuff
340000	342000	Then I played
342000	344000	And I actually purchased N Plus
344000	346000	On Xbox Live Arcade
346000	348000	And that game is just as fun as the original N
348000	351000	So thoroughly enjoying that
351000	354000	And
354000	356000	I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week
356000	359000	Because we were having this party
359000	361000	We have at the end of every month for our work
361000	363000	And this one happened to be leap year themed
363000	365000	And so they wanted Frogger
365000	367000	And they used my system to play Frogger
367000	369000	So I got to play some of that
369000	371000	Because no one else was touching it
371000	373000	And then
373000	376000	I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey
376000	378000	So that's actually pretty cool
378000	380000	I finally got to the point in the game
380000	382000	Where one of the characters dies
382000	384000	Not necessarily a main character
384000	387000	But I was just very surprised
387000	389000	On how everyone makes that argument
389000	391000	Of video games being art and stuff
391000	392000	Well
392000	394000	Shit I think there's a perfect example right there
394000	396000	Of how powerful they can make the story
396000	398000	And it was pretty cool
398000	400000	So
400000	403000	I'm about 11 hours into it now
403000	405000	Still on the first disc though
405000	407000	And just taking my time through that
407000	409000	And
409000	411000	Pretty much that's it I guess
411000	413000	Other than the usual Saints Row
413000	415000	But
415000	418000	No one wants to hear about that
418000	420000	For the five billionth time?
420000	422000	Yeah
422000	424000	Well let's see
424000	426000	In my gaming week I also played Lost Odyssey
426000	428000	And I had much the same experience as you did
428000	430000	I got to the second disc
430000	432000	Which means you kind of go through
432000	434000	Some big plot twists in the first event
434000	436000	Or first disc let's put it that way
436000	438000	And I'm amazed by the game
438000	440000	And I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flak
440000	442000	As it has been
442000	444000	Although you know I do understand
444000	446000	Some of the little complaints about the game
446000	448000	And even one of them I find to be kind of annoying
448000	450000	And that is lack of save points
450000	452000	One of the things that has been bugging me
452000	454000	Is that sometimes I'll be forced to sit there for an hour
454000	456000	While the next part of the game loads
456000	458000	Or whatever
458000	460000	I mean it just takes forever
460000	462000	It's crazy
462000	464000	To get to the next save point
464000	466000	While you watch through all these cut scenes
466000	468000	I mean it's not like it's bad
468000	470000	It's not like you're bored or anything
470000	472000	Or you're just getting antsy
472000	474000	Because there's lots to do
474000	476000	But sometimes I only want to play in little 30 minute chunks
476000	478000	And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour
478000	480000	It auto saves too for some things
480000	482000	Some things
482000	484000	There's checkpoints I guess
484000	486000	But not a lot
486000	488000	I haven't had that problem with save points
488000	490000	What do you think about the difficulty of the game?
490000	492000	It's not that difficult
492000	494000	Some of the boss battles were surprisingly tough
494000	496000	If you grind some of the way through there
496000	500000	Because a lot of this game seems like it's very quick
500000	502000	There's certain areas in the game
502000	504000	Where there's like two or three sections of the map
504000	508000	And then that's it
508000	510000	And then you're on to the next section of the world
510000	512000	Or whatever
512000	514000	It's very small
514000	516000	But
516000	518000	I don't know it wasn't that difficult
518000	520000	You just grind a little bit
520000	522000	And get your characters leveled up
522000	524000	And it's pretty easy
524000	526000	Also I have the preorder bonus
526000	528000	So I have an item that gives me
528000	530000	A level 2 guard or whatever
530000	532000	So I can block most of the shots
532000	534000	And it does zero damage to me
534000	536000	Nice I don't have that
536000	538000	That was something you got for preorder huh?
538000	540000	Hopefully they release that as a download thing later
540000	542000	It will probably come later on
542000	544000	Let's go over to the chatroom
544000	546000	The chatroom has their own comments
546000	550000	It only sucks when you die an hour without a save
550000	552000	Kind of true but there's also some things
552000	554000	Where you go through cutscene cutscene cutscene
554000	556000	And then you have to fight a big boss battle
556000	558000	I mean I know you can skip cutscenes
558000	560000	But even then sometimes you have to sit there
560000	562000	Because some of the cutscenes are rendered with the game engine
562000	564000	So you have to kind of sit there
564000	566000	And press A A A A A
566000	568000	You can also pause it
568000	570000	And hit the back button
570000	572000	For the cutscenes but what about the ones where they're actually talking to each other
572000	574000	With the dialogue boxes
574000	576000	You have to A A A
576000	578000	I don't know
578000	580000	It doesn't matter
580000	582000	It's honestly just a tiny little blemish
582000	584000	In what is otherwise a magnificent game
584000	586000	That deserves to be getting more attention than it is
586000	588000	As far as other games I've been playing this week
588000	590000	I'm playing Smash Brothers Brawl
590000	592000	Because I was
592000	596000	Loki was kind enough to loan me his Japanese copy
596000	598000	And the Wii to play it on
598000	600000	So I was checking that out a little bit this week
600000	602000	Didn't understand what I was doing but I was having fun
602000	604000	Playing just the massive
604000	606000	Free for all mode
606000	608000	So that was pretty cool
608000	610000	Obviously last week I was sick
610000	612000	On the show and I'm happy to report I'm better
612000	614000	I did have a sinus infection
614000	616000	So I had to go to a doctor and antibiotics and blah blah blah
616000	618000	He lent me that as kind of like a get better soon type thing
618000	620000	Which was very nice
620000	622000	He said I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time
622000	624000	I didn't actually hook that thing up till like Friday
624000	626000	That's exactly why I loaded tickets
626000	628000	This is exactly what I'm doing
628000	630000	I'm not playing Smash Brothers
630000	632000	Well I mean even before Smash Brothers Brawl
632000	634000	I never played Melee very much
634000	636000	Maybe once at a friend's house
636000	640000	The first Smash Brothers Brawl I didn't even touch
640000	642000	I don't know
642000	644000	It's not really my type of game
644000	646000	It's fun
646000	648000	But you know
648000	650000	I may pick up the US one
650000	652000	I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not
652000	654000	Gerardimo in chat says
654000	656000	Rob do you think Brawl lives up to the hype even if it's not in English?
656000	658000	Kind of
658000	660000	It's hard to tell
660000	662000	I don't feel right giving a fair review on a Japanese game
662000	664000	When I don't understand how to get into some of the modes
664000	666000	And look at the extra stuff
666000	668000	It does
668000	670000	Lowkey has no problem answering that
670000	672000	The parts I've seen so far
672000	674000	Like Smash Brothers Melee 1.5
674000	676000	A little bit
676000	678000	Because it's like the same kind of engine
678000	680000	The same stuff with just some new characters
680000	682000	But I realize that's not being totally fair
682000	684000	In saying that because I haven't looked at everything outside
684000	686000	Of just the brawling
686000	688000	But it does seem like there's a lot of the stuff they just copied
688000	690000	Right on over from the GameCube version
690000	692000	So very interesting
692000	694000	Frisbee says
694000	696000	Halo 3 feels like Halo 2.5
696000	698000	It's a little bit that
698000	700000	It's a little bit that
700000	702000	But that's what it is
702000	704000	So that was my gaming week
704000	706000	So if that's everybody's gaming week
706000	708000	Then we will move on to talking about some news
708000	710000	But for some housekeeping
710000	712000	Of which we have nothing special of note
712000	714000	What's that?
714000	716000	What's that?
716000	718000	The award contesting that's going on through all games
718000	720000	That's like three months old
720000	722000	I can't believe you just saw that
722000	724000	I did just see that
724000	726000	Hey I don't read
726000	728000	I unfortunately don't read their website
728000	730000	Or their forums
730000	732000	You're just too busy
732000	734000	Doing other things
734000	736000	I will give it a mention on air
736000	738000	I don't even know if it's still going on
738000	740000	I think it's kind of funny that Loki took so long to find it
740000	742000	I posted a link on the forums
742000	744000	Let me see
744000	746000	December 27th
746000	748000	I didn't even notice it
748000	750000	All games
750000	752000	Which our show runs on
752000	754000	We syndicate on their network
754000	756000	They play us Monday nights
756000	758000	And then Tuesday mornings
758000	760000	At 9am
760000	762000	No because they do their regular
762000	764000	All games show at 10 now
764000	766000	So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings
766000	768000	But I know our show is syndicated on their network
768000	770000	Mondays and Tuesdays supposedly
770000	772000	And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard
772000	774000	As a best affiliate podcast
774000	776000	And it's all going on in their forums
776000	778000	The voting
778000	780000	I would think it's already over
780000	782000	Three months ago
782000	784000	But then again the topics are still up
784000	786000	It's not closed
786000	788000	So who knows, maybe it's an ongoing thing
788000	790000	From yesterday to today
790000	792000	They've put the votes as anonymous
792000	794000	So you can't see
794000	796000	What each podcast has
796000	798000	Yesterday it didn't have it that way
798000	800000	And Tigerclaw says Sky they still haven't announced the winners
800000	802000	So I guess it is ongoing
802000	804000	For three months now
804000	806000	And Tigerclaw I know listens to all games
806000	808000	Like every other day
808000	810000	I don't know
810000	812000	I voted for us
812000	814000	Well I appreciate the support
814000	816000	I guess for yourself
816000	818000	I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby
818000	820000	But he bought a knife judgment
820000	822000	And I can't support that kind of behavior
822000	824000	That's most unfortunate
824000	826000	He also dropped out of the race
826000	828000	As of like yesterday
828000	830000	Didn't want to play that game huh
830000	832000	Alright well if you want to throw us a vote
832000	834000	It's over on forums.allgames.com
834000	836000	I will plug the other stuff I know we always got
836000	838000	We have our live general community at Orange Lounge
838000	840000	Our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio
840000	842000	And our Facebook is the O.L.R.
842000	844000	Be sure to look us up on our social networking sites
844000	846000	Meet other O.L.R. listeners
846000	848000	Look at our posts and clips of the show
848000	850000	We have on some of those places like MySpace
850000	852000	Tons of fun
852000	854000	Alright let's get into the gaming news. Loki take it away
854000	856000	Okay so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week
856000	858000	From Destination and Playstation
858000	860000	It's the retail only
860000	862000	Conference thing or whatever
862000	864000	I couldn't go but other people from my company did
864000	866000	Bastards
866000	868000	And of course
868000	870000	Some of the news that leaked out
870000	872000	Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date finally
872000	874000	It's officially coming to the U.S.
874000	876000	On June 12th
876000	878000	And that of course
878000	880000	Not only was leaked out but confirmed
880000	882000	By Konami
882000	884000	And they also said that if you reserve your copy
884000	886000	Of Metal Gear Solid 4 starting in April
886000	888000	2008
888000	890000	You get Metal Gear Saga 2.0
890000	892000	A DVD to catch you up on all the
892000	894000	Stuff that's going on in the series
894000	896000	As well as a
896000	898000	Data code for
898000	900000	Metal Gear Online
900000	902000	And then to coincide
902000	904000	With that and this
904000	906000	I don't know if this is going to be the official
906000	908000	You know remember because the 80 gig
908000	910000	Skew for the PS3 was being phased out
910000	912000	Well there's a new 80 gig Skew now
912000	914000	Same price but you get
914000	916000	Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3
916000	918000	Controller all for $4.99
918000	920000	Which is not a bad deal at all if you don't have
920000	922000	A PS3 because I know a lot of people
922000	924000	Would be buying a PS3 for that
924000	926000	And it's nice that they're actually throwing in
926000	928000	The DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that
928000	930000	Separately
930000	932000	No word on when that's coming out but it's
932000	934000	Supposed to come out around the same time as
934000	936000	Metal Gear Solid 4 obviously
936000	938000	So June 12th and on
938000	940000	I guess
940000	942000	Alright
942000	944000	Well moving on to
944000	946000	Other gaming news although it still
946000	948000	Has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4
948000	950000	Actually
950000	952000	Let me back up for just a minute
952000	954000	How important
954000	956000	Is this news to PlayStation
956000	958000	Fans you think?
958000	960000	I think it's very important
960000	962000	I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than
962000	964000	The year old MotorStorm
964000	966000	They needed to update that bundle
966000	968000	Anyways because
968000	970000	Shit that game is old now
970000	972000	And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game
972000	974000	To throw in there especially now that
974000	976000	I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with
976000	978000	The DualShock 3 controllers
978000	980000	Probably not the 40 gig for right now
980000	982000	Because there's supposedly
982000	984000	The one right now doesn't have it
984000	986000	And I don't know if they're going to announce a new one
986000	988000	Anytime soon
988000	990000	It's important
990000	992000	I think this game is actually one of the first
992000	994000	Major games for the PS3
994000	996000	That you can only get on the PS3
996000	998000	And you know that's
998000	1000000	A little bit of fuel to Sony's Fire
1000000	1002000	Although this is the first of hopefully many
1002000	1004000	But
1004000	1006000	It hopefully does very well
1006000	1008000	Let's say
1008000	1010000	Metal Gear Solid 4 does not sell
1010000	1012000	All that I mean let's say
1012000	1014000	Obviously the game is going to sell fine
1014000	1016000	At least mediocre
1016000	1018000	But let's say the game does not sell super duper well
1018000	1020000	And doesn't move all these new bundles
1020000	1022000	Is that going to be really bad for Sony
1022000	1024000	Or will they get more chances?
1024000	1026000	They may have more chances but a lot of the stuff
1026000	1028000	That they're counting on is like way later on
1028000	1030000	Killzone 2 will be another one that moves systems
1030000	1032000	Resistance Fall of Man 2
1032000	1034000	Maybe MotorStorm 2
1034000	1036000	And then
1036000	1038000	Final Fantasy 13 that's so far off
1038000	1040000	That I wouldn't even
1040000	1042000	Consider that anything to wait for
1042000	1044000	Right now for the PS3
1044000	1046000	If you're going to wait that long you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4
1046000	1048000	But
1048000	1050000	At the same time
1050000	1052000	I don't know
1052000	1054000	It should do very well
1054000	1056000	But once again you know they're also hoping
1056000	1058000	Like Blu-Ray is going to sell these systems
1058000	1060000	You know it's a lot of hopes and dreams
1060000	1062000	But we'll actually have to see what happens
1062000	1064000	I mean it'll be a very interesting spring
1064000	1066000	My parents got a Blu-Ray player
1066000	1068000	Which kind of surprised me
1068000	1070000	Because they're not usually on the cutting edge
1070000	1072000	Of all the technological gadgets
1072000	1074000	And I was playing with their Blu-Ray player a little bit
1074000	1076000	And it was slow
1076000	1078000	It was so slow
1078000	1080000	And I'm sorry I know sometimes we get the mail
1080000	1082000	Like you guys only pick on Sony
1082000	1084000	We hate Sony
1084000	1086000	Because if we hated Sony we would so have a PSP oriented website
1086000	1088000	But anyway it's beside the point
1088000	1090000	But seriously it was slow and clunky
1090000	1092000	It reminded me
1092000	1094000	Yeah it's the first generation I kind of think
1094000	1096000	Okay well the first DVD player we ever had
1096000	1098000	Was kind of slow and clunky too
1098000	1100000	I remember when I had a single speed CD-ROM drive
1100000	1102000	Now that's slow shit right there
1102000	1104000	Well Rob you know what
1104000	1106000	What?
1106000	1108000	I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-Ray player
1108000	1110000	Why?
1110000	1112000	We got an HD DVD player
1112000	1114000	Did you? Did you get the one for the Xbox?
1114000	1116000	Yes we did, 50 bucks
1116000	1118000	Nice
1118000	1120000	Oh yeah because they're so cheap now
1120000	1122000	Well the only movie I really want on it is Stardust
1122000	1124000	So I don't care what else Dan gets
1124000	1126000	You picked up a couple of movies
1126000	1128000	But I don't really care because that's all I'm getting
1128000	1130000	There you go
1130000	1132000	Nice
1132000	1134000	Alright well obviously Metal Gear Solid is one thing many PlayStation 3 fans are looking forward to
1134000	1136000	But there's also Metal Gear Online
1136000	1138000	And we already talked about
1138000	1140000	In a previous show the Metal Gear Online
1140000	1142000	Starter Pack that's supposed to be going out
1142000	1144000	With Metal Gear Solid 4
1144000	1146000	Well they're going to be beta testing Metal Gear Online
1146000	1148000	In late April
1148000	1150000	But here's the deal
1150000	1152000	If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4
1152000	1154000	You will get guaranteed access
1154000	1156000	Quote unquote to this limited beta
1156000	1158000	It's a little bit reminiscent
1158000	1160000	It seems to me like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing
1160000	1162000	I think
1162000	1164000	There you go
1164000	1166000	But I'm sure most people that would be into Metal Gear Online
1166000	1168000	Are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4
1168000	1170000	This is just incentive I guess to get pre-orders out there
1170000	1172000	Which makes sense to me
1172000	1174000	That Sony would want that
1174000	1176000	Because they're going to want strong numbers out the gate
1176000	1178000	It's impossible to try and put next to
1178000	1180000	Halo 3
1180000	1182000	And what I'm assuming
1182000	1184000	Will probably be Smash Brothers numbers
1184000	1186000	And so on and so on
1186000	1188000	It's kind of like their day one big seller
1188000	1190000	It's going to be the number one game for the console
1190000	1192000	It's just
1192000	1194000	Halo 3 may have
1194000	1196000	Been the number one game
1196000	1198000	For the Xbox 360
1198000	1200000	But I don't think it's sold that many systems
1200000	1202000	I mean I'm sure there's people that waited to buy a system
1202000	1204000	For Halo 3
1204000	1206000	I don't know
1206000	1208000	I don't believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game
1208000	1210000	Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems
1210000	1212000	But then again
1212000	1214000	Their system is still more expensive
1214000	1216000	And it's a little easier now
1216000	1218000	To make that purchase now that we know
1218000	1220000	That Blu-Ray is going to be the high def format
1220000	1222000	Of choice
1222000	1224000	And Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now
1224000	1226000	And we know when it's coming
1226000	1228000	And plus now you have
1228000	1230000	Grand Theft Auto 4 as well
1230000	1232000	There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there
1232000	1234000	But
1234000	1236000	They can't just rely on these
1236000	1238000	Couple games to push the sales
1238000	1240000	They really need to put out a strong library of games
1240000	1242000	And they have a lot of catching up to do
1242000	1244000	Alright well
1244000	1246000	For you Metal Gear Solid fans
1246000	1248000	You might want to go pre-order the game if you want to check out the
1248000	1250000	Online beta
1250000	1252000	If you don't already have it pre-ordered
1252000	1254000	Which I'm sure many of you do
1254000	1256000	Well
1256000	1258000	There had been talk that Metal Gear Solid
1258000	1260000	Was going to be ported to Playstation 2
1260000	1262000	That's actually not happening
1262000	1264000	It's just going
1264000	1266000	That the Metal Gear Solid
1266000	1268000	Essential Collection is going to be on
1268000	1270000	Two DVD's
1270000	1272000	It's supposed to be out on
1272000	1274000	March 18th for 29.99
1274000	1276000	Over here in the US
1276000	1278000	It's going to be a Playstation 1 game
1278000	1280000	That's awesome
1280000	1282000	Well I wouldn't see
1282000	1284000	There would be no point to really remake
1284000	1286000	Metal Gear Solid for Playstation 2
1286000	1288000	Maybe there were people that were hoping
1288000	1290000	Because there was the GameCube one
1290000	1292000	Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills
1292000	1294000	When it came out?
1294000	1296000	I think so
1296000	1298000	Maybe people were hoping some of those extra frills would come over
1298000	1300000	I'm surprised that they didn't put
1300000	1302000	Metal Gear Solid 1
1302000	1304000	And then also have VR missions
1304000	1306000	As well
1306000	1308000	Well my theory is that they are going to
1308000	1310000	This is again just my theory
1310000	1312000	Because really all
1312000	1314000	The VR missions was part of Metal Gear Solid Integral
1314000	1316000	Which was
1316000	1318000	Basically Metal Gear Solid done as a first person shooter
1318000	1320000	All you need to do is put in the camera control
1320000	1322000	And you can play it that way
1322000	1324000	So they could easily
1324000	1326000	Include the VR missions and the
1326000	1328000	I guess integral mode
1328000	1330000	Hmm
1330000	1332000	Well it's neat
1332000	1334000	I mean I guess it's not too
1334000	1336000	If this Playstation is backwards compatible
1336000	1338000	And all that at least what little
1338000	1340000	Backwards compatibility some of them have
1340000	1342000	It's not surprising that they only need to put it out there
1342000	1344000	On Playstation 1 format
1344000	1346000	Exactly and if I remember correctly
1346000	1348000	I believe this collection is coming out
1348000	1350000	In a couple weeks
1350000	1352000	Should be able to pick it up soon
1352000	1354000	And it's cheap 30 bucks
1354000	1356000	Very cool
1356000	1358000	A really cool
1358000	1360000	Well you know not cool for me because I already own
1360000	1362000	A couple PSPs but for someone that may not own
1362000	1364000	A PSP yet you can get a brand new PSP
1364000	1366000	Slim that happens to be red
1366000	1368000	With a giant head of Kratos
1368000	1370000	Silk screened on the back
1370000	1372000	This will actually be replacing
1372000	1374000	The Star Wars entertainment bundle
1374000	1376000	That they've had for a while
1376000	1378000	You can no longer get those unfortunately
1378000	1380000	And of course it will be coming out
1380000	1382000	I believe next week
1382000	1384000	With the brand new game
1384000	1386000	Of course God of War Chains of Olympus
1386000	1388000	And some other cool stuff that will come
1388000	1390000	With this entertainment pack
1390000	1392000	It will come with a copy of
1392000	1394000	The Superbad UMD
1394000	1396000	As well as a voucher to download
1396000	1398000	Syphon Filter Combat Ops
1398000	1400000	From the PC Playstation store
1400000	1402000	Now here's my only little problem
1402000	1404000	With this whole thing
1404000	1406000	Usually these entertainment packs come with
1406000	1408000	A 1 gigabyte memory stick
1408000	1410000	I have heard no mention of a 1 gigabyte memory stick
1410000	1412000	With this so
1412000	1414000	Yay I can download a game to nothing
1414000	1416000	You have to buy a memory stick separately
1416000	1418000	Way to go awesome
1418000	1420000	This might be a bad idea
1420000	1422000	But do you think we're just supposed to assume
1422000	1424000	It's there anyway?
1424000	1426000	I don't think it is because they would have mentioned it
1426000	1428000	It would have been a selling point
1428000	1430000	Hey surprise me
1430000	1432000	Maybe it is in there
1432000	1434000	I'm just going to take a while to guess
1434000	1436000	As they didn't mention it
1436000	1438000	And I don't think it was in the press release
1438000	1440000	Although I will double check in just a second here
1440000	1442000	I'm pretty sure it does not come with a memory stick
1442000	1444000	Which is kind of sad
1444000	1446000	Now Alpha Canagram in chat says
1446000	1448000	Loki bigger sizes are dirt cheap
1448000	1450000	1 gig is useless
1450000	1452000	That's fine okay
1452000	1454000	But the fact is it's still stupid to offer
1454000	1456000	A free downloadable game
1456000	1458000	A voucher or whatever
1458000	1460000	That's worth I guess 10 bucks
1460000	1462000	When you don't have anything to store it to
1462000	1464000	Well here's my thought
1464000	1466000	What about the fact that
1466000	1468000	My roommate was hooking up a new printer today
1468000	1470000	And it didn't come with a USB cable
1470000	1472000	To hook it up to the computer
1472000	1474000	So it's kind of that same logic to me
1474000	1476000	Batteries not included except now it's other things
1476000	1478000	Memory not included
1478000	1480000	I understand
1480000	1482000	Buying a game console back in the day
1482000	1484000	Didn't come with a memory card
1484000	1486000	To save your games and stuff
1486000	1488000	It's completely optional but
1488000	1490000	I mean come on
1490000	1492000	God of War, Chains of Olympus, Syphon Filter
1492000	1494000	You're going to need a memory stick
1494000	1496000	And it's just kind of annoying that you get it all home
1496000	1498000	Or something you get it for Easter or something like that
1498000	1500000	And it's like
1500000	1502000	Yeah I'm ready to play this game
1502000	1504000	Aw shit I gotta go drive back down to the store
1504000	1506000	To pick up my memory stick
1506000	1508000	I don't know I think it's still kind of cheap
1508000	1510000	But whatever
1510000	1512000	I mean if that's kind of your thing
1512000	1514000	Then go ahead and purchase it
1514000	1516000	And it'll probably be limited
1516000	1518000	Since the last one was too
1518000	1520000	Although I think
1520000	1522000	Most people that are all crazy about God of War
1522000	1524000	Most of them probably already have a PSP don't you think?
1524000	1526000	That's always what amazes me about these
1526000	1528000	Bundles that come out so much later
1528000	1530000	But oh yeah this is also coming out
1530000	1532000	In June-ish I mean that around
1532000	1534000	That time frame so it's going to be three months after
1534000	1536000	The game actually comes out
1536000	1538000	I don't know it's cool I guess if you don't
1538000	1540000	Have one yet I mean maybe
1540000	1542000	You might think about picking this up
1542000	1544000	But to be honest the only reason I picked up
1544000	1546000	My Daxter bundle was because it was the only thing
1546000	1548000	Available at the time so
1548000	1550000	It wasn't like I really wanted to play Daxter
1550000	1552000	Another comment from chat
1552000	1554000	From ake ripper I think that is
1554000	1556000	A K E ripper
1556000	1558000	It's chat.orngelandstranger.com says
1558000	1560000	Still one gigabyte you don't get far
1560000	1562000	You know what
1562000	1564000	I'm using my 16 memory
1564000	1566000	16 megabyte memory stick
1566000	1568000	That came with my original PSP
1568000	1570000	32 or whatever it is I'm using the old school original
1570000	1572000	One from the first PSP bundle
1572000	1574000	Hey you know what that's fine
1574000	1576000	That's the thing right now
1576000	1578000	Say you can't
1578000	1580000	Just throw in a 32 meg one
1580000	1582000	Yeah I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later
1582000	1584000	But hey you know what at least it will get you through
1584000	1586000	Being able to save your game
1586000	1588000	Of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box
1588000	1590000	And I'm sure since those
1590000	1592000	One gigabyte memory sticks are what 30 bucks
1592000	1594000	Now the 32 megabyte one should be like 50 cents
1594000	1596000	If that
1596000	1598000	Come on they've got to be sitting on a bunch of them
1598000	1600000	Just dump that shit
1600000	1602000	Hey I'm not alone
1602000	1604000	We have another chatter in chat and I cannot pronounce this name
1604000	1606000	For the life of me it's
1606000	1608000	TVVICHMAN
1608000	1610000	I don't know
1610000	1612000	Says I still use my 32 so I'm not alone
1612000	1614000	So there you have it
1614000	1616000	Well you know a lot of people
1616000	1618000	Very excited about home
1618000	1620000	Even though it keeps kind of getting pushed back
1620000	1622000	And pushed back but you know what they say
1622000	1624000	As long as there's reason and purpose
1624000	1626000	Behind pushing it back then sometimes
1626000	1628000	It isn't all necessarily a bad thing
1628000	1630000	Apparently
1630000	1632000	Some big Sony games are going to be integrated
1632000	1634000	Into home and those games are Warhawk
1634000	1636000	Uncharted, Drakes, Fortune and Resistance
1636000	1638000	Fall of Man and assumably these are just
1638000	1640000	Three to start and you know obviously more would follow
1640000	1642000	I imagine you know big
1642000	1644000	Other big titles even from third party publishers
1644000	1646000	Would be included here too
1646000	1648000	Warhawk is going to let eight people
1648000	1650000	Meet in like a war room area
1650000	1652000	Prior to a match and you can make out
1652000	1654000	Your strategies on a sand table
1654000	1656000	That's like a replica of the different levels
1656000	1658000	In the game and then you go right from there
1658000	1660000	Into your match so
1660000	1662000	Kind of cute and then Resistance and
1662000	1664000	Uncharted basically your avatars
1664000	1666000	Can go into levels from those
1666000	1668000	Games and that would allow you
1668000	1670000	To get to parts of the game that are even completely
1670000	1672000	Unseen now in addition to that
1672000	1674000	Uncharted is supposed to have a 2D shooter game
1674000	1676000	That's built into it that launches from home
1676000	1678000	So that's some cool ideas
1678000	1680000	That sounds fairly
1680000	1682000	Generous and kind of neat
1682000	1684000	You know I imagine the shooter
1684000	1686000	Is cheesy but it's better
1686000	1688000	Than nothing and it's probably kind of one of those
1688000	1690000	Like cool little you know integrations
1690000	1692000	The news about
1692000	1694000	Home is very exciting and it makes
1694000	1696000	Me wish it would have been out a lot sooner but
1696000	1698000	You know okay if the delays are making it better
1698000	1700000	Then it's hard to complain right? It's all part of their plan
1700000	1702000	To hopefully get more momentum I mean and this is
1702000	1704000	Also stuff that they can say look here
1704000	1706000	Live does not have this
1706000	1708000	This is why you should buy a PS3
1708000	1710000	They're giving us reasons now why you should
1710000	1712000	Own a system which is what they should have been
1712000	1714000	Doing since the beginning
1714000	1716000	Frisbee in chat says push it back
1716000	1718000	Until no one cares am I right?
1718000	1720000	I don't know but the more they drop little tidbits
1720000	1722000	Like this it's hard to ignore
1722000	1724000	Yeah but at the same time though it's like
1724000	1726000	You know Duke Nukem Forever
1726000	1728000	Come on dude I would like to see a little
1728000	1730000	More video of this stuff
1730000	1732000	In action not just screenshots I mean
1732000	1734000	You know just because that really
1734000	1736000	Video helps you get so much more of a sense
1736000	1738000	Of what it really looks like than pictures
1738000	1740000	The trophy room thing
1740000	1742000	It's kind of neat I guess but at the same time
1742000	1744000	I'm just like whatever
1744000	1746000	Like I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room
1746000	1748000	And see a stupid dragon from Lair
1748000	1750000	I'd be like wow
1750000	1752000	Testament that you played Lair
1752000	1754000	Man you suck
1754000	1756000	Well you know what though Xbox is the same thing with the achievements
1756000	1758000	You know you get certain achievements
1758000	1760000	Well it's like I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room of like
1760000	1762000	Achievements that they've earned during like you know
1762000	1764000	Totem Ball or some shit
1764000	1766000	You played the game for ten hours or something
1766000	1768000	Wow you have dedication
1768000	1770000	You pressed start
1770000	1772000	Achievement unlocked wasn't that one in the Simpsons game
1772000	1774000	Madden or
1774000	1776000	Simpsons maybe or Avatar
1776000	1778000	You hit something eight times in a row
1778000	1780000	1000 points unlocked
1780000	1782000	I don't know Jamie are you excited about
1782000	1784000	Home on Playstation 3
1784000	1786000	Relatively
1786000	1788000	I'm excited because it's free if I had to pay for that shit
1788000	1790000	I'm not playing in home
1790000	1792000	Free is a good thing
1792000	1794000	Then again Yaris was free
1794000	1796000	Oh that is a good point
1796000	1798000	Touche from Jamie
1798000	1800000	Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record
1804000	1806000	Well there actually
1806000	1808000	Is a date now for that
1808000	1810000	Dual Shock 3
1810000	1812000	Over here in the US we're getting it on April 15th
1812000	1814000	For $54.99
1814000	1816000	And I don't want that for my birthday
1816000	1818000	So nobody get it for me
1818000	1820000	But it's
1820000	1822000	I mean it's basically
1822000	1824000	From what I can tell in here
1824000	1826000	The 6 axis with vibration
1826000	1828000	So
1828000	1830000	So basically it's the controller that should have come out
1830000	1832000	The first time it's finally coming out
1832000	1834000	Yeah except for all the crappy legal
1834000	1836000	Problems they were having
1836000	1838000	What was the price again on that
1838000	1840000	That's a $54.99
1840000	1842000	$54 bucks for a freaking controller
1842000	1844000	But then again Xbox is just as bad right
1844000	1846000	Isn't it like $59 for their wireless
1846000	1848000	It's the same price as their current controllers
1848000	1850000	He rumbles $5 extra
1850000	1852000	I guess
1852000	1854000	That is too damn much for a controller
1854000	1856000	Wait no I actually rumble
1856000	1858000	Well tilt sensors in rumble are $5 extra
1858000	1860000	Well it is also wireless
1860000	1862000	But still
1862000	1864000	Yeah the wireless controller
1864000	1866000	I don't know
1866000	1868000	I don't give Xbox a pass here either
1868000	1870000	I think their controllers are way too expensive too
1870000	1872000	And then the Wii one is just as bad too
1872000	1874000	The controllers are way too damn much money
1874000	1876000	I have to say something though for the Xbox 360
1876000	1878000	Controllers that the keyboard attachment is cool
1878000	1880000	Really?
1880000	1882000	I haven't even really played with one ever
1882000	1884000	The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the
1884000	1886000	Remote nunchuck because the remote is $40
1886000	1888000	And the nunchuck is $20
1888000	1890000	So it's $60 all together
1890000	1892000	I don't know I guess maybe for some reason
1892000	1894000	I let Nintendo slip by a little more
1894000	1896000	And I know people want to call it fanboyism
1896000	1898000	But I don't here's my logic
1898000	1900000	I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price
1900000	1902000	Because that controller is
1902000	1904000	Really kind of like the core of the system
1904000	1906000	And the motion and everything
1906000	1908000	But I don't know I guess one could argue that
1908000	1910000	It's the same thing on the Playstation 3
1910000	1912000	I don't know what the motion should on the Playstation 3
1912000	1914000	Is very like kind of
1914000	1916000	Last minute?
1916000	1918000	Not really last minute
1918000	1920000	But just kind of useless I think
1920000	1922000	I like this comment from Alpha Canagram in chat
1922000	1924000	He says Skye wait
1924000	1926000	Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube
1926000	1928000	Was most expensive
1928000	1930000	That's true because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance
1930000	1932000	If you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles
1932000	1934000	You had to get four of those
1934000	1936000	You know we actually still kept our Game Boy Advance for that reason
1936000	1938000	So that we could play Pac-Man vs.
1938000	1940000	I was going to say I can only think of like
1940000	1942000	Three games that even use that feature
1942000	1944000	Not four because there's Animal Crossing was one
1944000	1946000	And yeah Animal Crossing
1946000	1948000	Pac-Man vs. Crystal Chronicles
1948000	1950000	And Zelda for sorts
1950000	1952000	And that's really it just a handful of games
1952000	1956000	But Pac-Man vs. is awesome
1956000	1960000	And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii
1960000	1962000	You start to see more of that stuff too
1962000	1964000	Didn't Pac-Man vs. come out on the Namco Museum DS?
1964000	1966000	Yes that's right
1966000	1968000	It's pretty cool
1968000	1970000	It is pretty cool
1970000	1972000	Not enough to get me to buy Namco games all over again
1972000	1974000	Those classic collections that keep re-releasing
1974000	1976000	Random thoughts
1976000	1978000	Speaking of classic collections
1978000	1980000	It just kind of made me go huh
1980000	1982000	I was randomly at a record store earlier this week
1982000	1984000	Because I was gasping shock and awe
1984000	1986000	Buying a CD I know I know
1986000	1988000	I was actually buying a CD
1988000	1990000	And this place sells video games as well
1990000	1992000	They sell used video games
1992000	1994000	And I actually saw on the play
1994000	1996000	And I was actually looking at like old Genesis
1996000	1998000	And Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything
1998000	2000000	Like really like cool in the retro stuff
2000000	2002000	It was all sports
2002000	2004000	It was all sports stuff like Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL
2004000	2006000	So that's pretty much all they had
2006000	2008000	But one thing I noticed on the Playstation 2
2008000	2010000	Is an Activision anthology
2010000	2012000	And I never even knew this game existed
2012000	2014000	Because the Activision releases an anthology
2014000	2016000	On every system
2016000	2018000	You know they had one on Playstation 1
2018000	2020000	They've had one on the PC
2020000	2022000	I actually own the one on PC
2022000	2024000	They've had a ton of them
2024000	2026000	I didn't realize they had one on Playstation 2
2026000	2028000	But I just thought it was funny
2028000	2030000	Because I'm reading the back of the box
2030000	2032000	Like all the games that are in it
2032000	2034000	And like this is how they're selling the game
2034000	2036000	Is that A it talks about you can do cool effects
2036000	2038000	To the games while you're playing
2038000	2040000	Like you can play Pitfall
2040000	2042000	It's even an Activision compilation
2042000	2044000	Pitfall 2 and some of these other
2044000	2046000	Like really obscure Activision games
2046000	2048000	Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure
2048000	2050000	The other ones that were listed were very obscure
2050000	2052000	Like Bridge
2052000	2054000	What's that?
2054000	2056000	I think I'm going to order a freeloader
2056000	2058000	You're going to order the Activision one?
2058000	2060000	No a freeloader
2060000	2062000	Oh freeloader? Oh
2062000	2064000	We'll talk more about that a little later I bet
2064000	2066000	So another person jumping from the Sony ship
2066000	2068000	Would be Phil Harrison
2068000	2070000	He's actually resigned from
2070000	2072000	Sony Computer Entertainment
2072000	2074000	Which is sad because that only leaves
2074000	2076000	Kaz left and
2076000	2078000	Luckily though it's not
2078000	2080000	Was it not
2080000	2082000	Oh god
2082000	2084000	The crazy guy
2084000	2086000	Ken Kutaragi
2086000	2088000	Thank god he's not the only one left
2088000	2090000	Piloting this boat here
2090000	2092000	No that does leave Kaz
2092000	2094000	I believe there were some rumors on where
2094000	2096000	He was going to go
2096000	2098000	Between Atari
2098000	2100000	To I don't know why he would jump
2100000	2102000	From one ship to another sinking ship
2102000	2104000	But whatever
2104000	2106000	But sad to see him go because
2106000	2108000	He was actually kind of a voice of logic
2108000	2110000	I guess for the company
2110000	2112000	But who needs that?
2112000	2114000	Really
2114000	2116000	I don't know
2116000	2118000	But that is weird
2118000	2120000	If it's true he went to Atari
2120000	2122000	That's kind of like
2122000	2124000	I don't know but maybe he can help fix things there
2124000	2126000	That would be nice to see them turn around
2128000	2130000	Alright well
2130000	2132000	With all this talk about Lost Odyssey
2132000	2134000	And what a great RPG it is
2134000	2136000	Sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out
2136000	2138000	That were actually really amazing
2138000	2140000	One of them was Persona 3
2140000	2142000	And I admit I did not get to really play much of Persona 3
2142000	2144000	I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is
2144000	2146000	But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it
2146000	2148000	Because apparently
2148000	2150000	Persona FES which is an expansion
2150000	2152000	To Persona 3
2152000	2154000	Is coming out here in the US on April 22
2154000	2156000	And it will set you back $29.99
2156000	2158000	But the cool thing about it
2158000	2160000	Obviously this is a Playstation 2 game
2160000	2162000	It's not in the current gen of consoles
2162000	2164000	It's in Playstation 2
2164000	2166000	But obviously that's what a lot of people still have
2166000	2168000	But for such a low price
2168000	2170000	For such a huge game
2170000	2172000	You get both the enhanced version of Persona 3
2172000	2174000	And new bonus features
2174000	2176000	And a new chapter that is apparently 30 plus hours
2176000	2178000	So this is kind of like Oblivion game of the year edition
2178000	2180000	But for Persona
2180000	2182000	5 bucks which isn't bad
2182000	2184000	There's still pretty good stuff coming out in the Playstation 2
2184000	2186000	And luckily a lot of the people
2186000	2188000	That put out really crappy shovelware games
2188000	2190000	For the PS2
2190000	2192000	Have now moved to the Wii
2192000	2194000	So you get a pretty good crowd
2194000	2196000	Although there are still some
2196000	2198000	But luckily now they've adopted the price point at $14.99 retail
2198000	2200000	Which you can't beat that
2200000	2202000	Even if it does suck
2202000	2204000	Well you can download a lot of games
2204000	2206000	For five bucks
2206000	2208000	So I don't know $14.99 still feels too expensive
2208000	2210000	For me for a crap game
2210000	2212000	You know Hannah Montana goes to college
2212000	2214000	Or whatever the hell they put out
2214000	2216000	I don't know I pulled that name out of thin air
2216000	2218000	You want to know what status I think they would make that game?
2218000	2220000	They just might
2220000	2222000	Patent pending
2222000	2224000	She goes to college, she's rich
2224000	2226000	I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana
2226000	2228000	Even if I were really rich I would want to be fully educated
2228000	2230000	True
2230000	2232000	But then again if you're
2232000	2234000	I think in my mind it's the perfect
2234000	2236000	A puppet of Disney then
2236000	2238000	In my mind it's a sitcom
2238000	2240000	Just like Saved by the Bell went to college
2240000	2242000	At one point
2242000	2244000	I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney channel stars
2244000	2246000	Need to go to college at some point
2246000	2248000	That's their exciting surroundings
2248000	2250000	That would have saved Brittany from her fate
2250000	2252000	Perhaps
2252000	2254000	Goofy goes to college
2254000	2256000	Can I read the next story please?
2256000	2258000	You may
2258000	2260000	Well Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out
2260000	2262000	It says it will be out in time
2262000	2264000	For the winter holiday
2264000	2266000	To be
2266000	2268000	Politically correct
2268000	2270000	I'm so excited that they're releasing Game On Festivus
2272000	2274000	Decemberween
2274000	2276000	Gives you something to celebrate
2276000	2280000	So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?
2280000	2282000	It's island themed
2282000	2284000	Which is so, you know
2284000	2286000	Wintery
2286000	2288000	That might be kind of fun though
2288000	2290000	I did think the first one had too much dirt
2290000	2292000	This one seems to have plenty of dirt in it too
2292000	2294000	It's in the middle of a desert
2294000	2296000	I'm sorry
2296000	2298000	Too much dirt for you
2298000	2300000	Although, you know what
2300000	2302000	I really have to say that
2302000	2304000	The artist's joystick
2304000	2306000	Where we got this information from
2306000	2308000	Are very creative
2308000	2310000	I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon
2310000	2312000	Because I don't think they've done a
2312000	2314000	Good off-road moon racing game
2314000	2316000	Actually
2316000	2318000	There was Cruise in the World
2318000	2320000	Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX
2320000	2322000	Cruise in the World had you go play on the moon
2322000	2324000	And then you ran into aliens
2324000	2326000	That had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub
2326000	2328000	Thank you
2328000	2330000	Malholus in chat
2330000	2332000	I hope I'm pronouncing that right
2332000	2334000	We have a lot of new chatters tonight
2334000	2336000	Malholus in chat says
2336000	2338000	Moon Patrol
2338000	2340000	Damn straight
2340000	2342000	That's all the moon game you need
2342000	2344000	Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?
2344000	2346000	I was just thinking
2346000	2348000	There's all these bastardized Atari games
2348000	2350000	From years past
2350000	2352000	Why didn't they ever put out a bastardized Moon Patrol?
2352000	2354000	That's what I'm curious about
2354000	2356000	What picture am I looking for?
2356000	2358000	The screen capture
2358000	2360000	They took a picture from Motorstorm and put
2360000	2362000	Microsoft Paint
2362000	2364000	I have to show this in the chatroom because it's hilarious
2364000	2366000	Oh, I just thought of it
2366000	2368000	Hannah Montana
2368000	2370000	Goes to her first frat party
2370000	2372000	Hannah Montana
2372000	2374000	goes wild
2374000	2376000	Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs
2376000	2378000	Hannah Montana gets a podcast
2378000	2380000	They already do crap like that
2380000	2382000	It's called the evening news
2382000	2384000	There you go, Malholus again
2384000	2386000	Hannah Montana goes to the moon
2386000	2388000	There it is, right there, two things we need
2388000	2390000	Alright, enough of this
2390000	2392000	I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana
2392000	2394000	We do not need more Hannah Montana
2394000	2396000	We need less Hannah Montana
2396000	2398000	What we do need more of
2398000	2400000	Is more colors in PS3
2400000	2402000	And there is a rumor
2402000	2404000	I was just thinking that
2404000	2406000	I know, I wasn't
2406000	2408000	I can read minds
2408000	2410000	It's a
2410000	2412000	It's a skill I learned
2412000	2414000	So
2414000	2416000	There is a new SKU coming out for the
2416000	2418000	48 PS3, I know this for a fact
2418000	2420000	Because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3
2420000	2422000	The Blu-Ray
2422000	2424000	Because Sony thinks, you know what
2424000	2426000	Blu-Ray is the winning format
2426000	2428000	We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3
2428000	2430000	You will just buy your own fucking
2430000	2432000	Blu-Ray movies
2432000	2434000	So there is going to be a new SKU coming out
2434000	2436000	And apparently
2436000	2438000	Some Circuit City employees
2438000	2440000	Have begun receiving their shipments
2440000	2442000	Of these new PS3s
2442000	2444000	And on the shipping box there is a model number
2444000	2448000	Which is CECHH01
2448000	2450000	And for those who may remember
2450000	2452000	A while back when we covered that the FCC
2452000	2454000	Had a
2454000	2456000	Item filed from
2456000	2458000	Sony regarding a white PS3
2458000	2460000	While the item numbers
2460000	2462000	Happened to match
2462000	2464000	So is it going to be the white system
2464000	2466000	Coming out to
2466000	2468000	Replace the black one with the
2468000	2470000	Spider-Man 3?
2470000	2472000	Maybe? I don't know
2472000	2474000	We'll have to see I guess
2474000	2476000	But if that's the case
2476000	2478000	It's going to be coming soon
2478000	2480000	Are there really people that are like
2480000	2482000	I mean do these people really really exist
2482000	2484000	That are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3
2484000	2486000	Until they release them in white
2486000	2488000	Or until they release them in red
2488000	2490000	Or what are the colors that we talked about
2490000	2492000	The silver thing that we talked about
2492000	2494000	On another show in another country
2494000	2496000	Are there really those people
2496000	2498000	I don't think that there are
2498000	2500000	People maybe with the DS because it's cheaper
2500000	2502000	But I don't think color is really going to
2502000	2504000	I don't know
2504000	2506000	Sway you on buying the system or not
2506000	2508000	People aren't going to go
2508000	2510000	It's $400
2510000	2512000	If only it were in white
2512000	2514000	I would really just make the purchase
2514000	2516000	I just need something that matches the drapes
2516000	2518000	And black doesn't do it for me
2518000	2520000	I fucking hate when they come out with new system colors
2520000	2522000	Because then they have to come out with new accessory colors
2522000	2524000	And new everything colors
2524000	2526000	And it just sucks
2526000	2528000	Lots of comments in chat
2528000	2530000	Brad from PodCulture says
2530000	2532000	I waited until Blue to get my DS
2532000	2534000	With Nintendo though it's inevitable
2534000	2536000	That they're going to come out in other colors
2536000	2538000	That is still a little crazy
2538000	2540000	Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing
2540000	2542000	But you'll notice whatever happened to the pink Wii
2542000	2544000	Whatever happened to that
2544000	2546000	They didn't need to do it, that's what I guess
2546000	2548000	SSJ100Matt says
2548000	2550000	Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3
2550000	2553000	Damn right, I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3
2553000	2555000	That would be the best
2555000	2558000	chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you'd like to join in
2558000	2561000	We do try to keep an eye on JustinTV's chat room as well
2561000	2564000	But sometimes I have a hard time staying on top of that
2564000	2566000	Because that's two different chat rooms
2566000	2568000	That's a lot
2568000	2570000	Something you're going to be able to play on those
2570000	2572000	White PlayStations
2572000	2578000	Would be lots and lots of games coming to the PlayStations store
2578000	2582000	25 old school titles have been leaked
2582000	2586000	By the European version of the PlayStations store
2586000	2588000	Well also
2588000	2590000	There are some pretty cool titles in there
2590000	2592000	No, there are some very cool titles in there
2592000	2594000	That's what makes me think it's probably fake
2594000	2598000	It's not fake, these are from the European version of the ESRB
2598000	2600000	Is where they got these titles from
2600000	2602000	I thought it was the store delete
2602000	2604000	Well they're coming to the PlayStations store
2604000	2606000	The PEGI
2606000	2608000	I guess leaked this information
2608000	2612000	I thought it was Sony that accidentally somehow made these visible for a minute
2612000	2614000	Well then I guess it's legit
2614000	2616000	And there are some cool games coming out
2616000	2618000	Bust a Groove, Holla
2618000	2620000	Those folks that like their old school music games and stuff
2620000	2622000	Very excited to hear that
2622000	2624000	Crash Bandicoot 3
2624000	2626000	Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3
2626000	2628000	Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies
2628000	2630000	Everybody's Golf, Klona
2630000	2632000	Klonoa, sorry
2632000	2634000	Klonoa is like the best game ever
2634000	2636000	Kurushi Final, Motortune Grand Prix
2636000	2638000	Namco Museum 1, 2 and 4
2638000	2640000	I don't know what happened to 3
2640000	2642000	Omega Boost, Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4
2642000	2644000	Rollcage, Spyro
2644000	2646000	Tekken 2, 3
2646000	2648000	Twisted Metal, Vib Ribbon
2648000	2650000	Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097
2650000	2652000	Vib Ribbon
2652000	2654000	That's pretty awesome
2654000	2656000	That game is crack
2656000	2658000	And actually I don't know if a lot of people remember
2658000	2662000	Colony Wars is actually pretty decent as far as the space shooter goes
2662000	2664000	Same with Cool Borders, that was pretty fun
2664000	2666000	Omega Boost was awesome
2666000	2668000	Son of Dad says Intelligent Cube please
2668000	2670000	There you go
2670000	2672000	He said don't they have the PSP one?
2672000	2674000	Didn't they come out with like a sequel-ish thing to that game?
2674000	2676000	Yeah they have a couple of them
2676000	2678000	Let's see, Crunky Boy Jr. in chat says
2678000	2680000	I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared it right up
2680000	2682000	Hey, Klonoa was a great game
2682000	2684000	But it was messed up at the end
2684000	2686000	I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you
2686000	2688000	Nice
2688000	2690000	So in other bundle-y news
2690000	2692000	In Europe they're going to get a
2692000	2694000	Pretty decent bundle I'm going to say
2694000	2696000	That is the
2696000	2698000	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle
2698000	2700000	And it's a 40GB PS3
2700000	2702000	I'm sorry, my apologies
2702000	2704000	80GB
2704000	2706000	Oh sorry, they're doing two of them
2706000	2708000	My apologies
2708000	2710000	I was just staring at the red box
2710000	2712000	Because it's, well
2712000	2714000	Kind of red and black and very cool colored
2714000	2716000	And it's got a silver car up on the front of it
2716000	2718000	I can't see what it is though
2718000	2720000	But they are saying that
2720000	2722000	It's going to be
2722000	2724000	Out on a
2724000	2726000	It's going to be
2726000	2728000	Out on a
2728000	2730000	It's going to be out on a
2730000	2732000	It's going to be out on a
2732000	2734000	It's going to be out on a
2734000	2736000	Looks like a
2736000	2738000	March 29th
2738000	2740000	And retails for
2740000	2742000	$3.99 Euro
2742000	2744000	So that's pretty cool
2746000	2748000	I love all this hubble-oo over
2748000	2750000	Prologue, it's not even the actual game
2750000	2752000	It's just prologue
2752000	2754000	You know to be honest I think this game
2754000	2756000	Is going to hurt their sales for the full game
2756000	2758000	You think? A lot of people like
2758000	2760000	If I were to, if I had to buy
2760000	2762000	A Gran Turismo game I don't think I'd buy the full one
2762000	2764000	Because I don't race 200 cars
2764000	2766000	You know there's only a few cars
2766000	2768000	That actually probably race
2768000	2770000	And you know after I play this game
2770000	2772000	You know prologue for however
2772000	2774000	Many months until the full game comes out
2774000	2776000	I'll probably be sick of it
2776000	2778000	And just be like okay whatever I'm done
2778000	2780000	I'm not going to spend another $50 or whatever
2780000	2782000	To upgrade to have
2782000	2784000	More cars
2784000	2786000	Now the smart thing to do
2786000	2788000	Would be to release the retail version
2788000	2790000	Of Gran Turismo 5
2790000	2792000	And release a $20 update
2792000	2794000	That would give you all the additional cars
2794000	2796000	And tracks
2796000	2798000	That would never happen though
2798000	2800000	RossdielUT in chat says
2800000	2802000	Loki Gran Turismo isn't for you it's for crazed car freaks
2802000	2804000	There's another bundle listed on here too
2804000	2806000	What's that?
2806000	2808000	A blu-ray bundle
2808000	2810000	The 40GB PS3
2810000	2812000	With Spiderman 300 and Casino Royale
2812000	2814000	On March 19th
2814000	2816000	Now that's reasonable
2816000	2818000	That Blu-ray has officially won or whatever
2818000	2820000	That's you know totally understandable
2820000	2822000	There's a lot of people that are going to buy
2822000	2824000	PlayStation 3 just because it plays Blu-rays and games
2824000	2826000	You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people
2826000	2828000	To do that because that's how PlayStation 2 won
2828000	2830000	Hey I bought my PlayStation 2
2830000	2832000	Well actually no I didn't buy it
2832000	2834000	As a DVD player I just bought it because
2834000	2836000	Armored Core was coming out on it
2836000	2838000	And I love me some Armored Core
2838000	2840000	Except I didn't buy Armored Core 4
2840000	2842000	Whatever
2842000	2844000	I liked what Akdeft in chat says too
2844000	2848000	Gran Turismo 5 prologue, Gran Turismo 5 introduction, Gran Turismo 5
2848000	2850000	And then Gran Turismo 5 epilogue
2852000	2856000	And yet no Gran Turismo portable for the PSP
2856000	2858000	It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series
2858000	2860000	It's like Final Fantasy 7 games now at some point
2862000	2864000	And they'll have Final Fantasy
2864000	2866000	You know prologue with cars
2866000	2868000	You know Gran Turismo
2868000	2870000	Gran Turismo with dress fears
2870000	2872000	There's different kinds of chocobos
2872000	2876000	Do you get to try out different chocobos?
2876000	2878000	Well you may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5
2878000	2880000	There are plenty of other games
2880000	2882000	To get your attention this week
2882000	2884000	Starting things off we have Bully Scholarship Edition
2884000	2886000	Coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360
2886000	2888000	Slightly better than I guess the PlayStation 2 version
2888000	2890000	Because it has slightly better graphics
2890000	2892000	And a few more missions
2892000	2894000	Great
2894000	2896000	The game I teased last week
2896000	2898000	Let's Ride Friends Forever
2898000	2900000	Coming out on the DS
2900000	2902000	Worst name ever
2902000	2904000	If you're into baseball
2904000	2906000	Or most unintentionally funny name ever
2906000	2908000	Depending on how you look at it
2908000	2910000	There's going to be two games for you
2910000	2912000	Sony's MLB 08 The Show
2912000	2916000	And that's coming on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PSP
2916000	2918000	And then MLB 2K8
2918000	2922000	Coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360
2922000	2928000	We have Army of Two coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
2928000	2930000	Chicken Hunter on the DS
2930000	2934000	It's a stupid game where you kill chickens
2934000	2936000	So it's not just a clever name
2936000	2938000	No, it's very literal
2938000	2940000	And imagine Figure Skater
2940000	2944000	It is a game where you are a figure skater
2944000	2946000	And you get to do little gay ass moves
2946000	2948000	Yay, Figure Skater
2948000	2950000	I'm almost offended by that comment
2950000	2954000	I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to Figure Skater
2954000	2956000	Yeah, exactly
2956000	2959000	Let's see what else we have here
2959000	2964000	Also, Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC
2964000	2966000	Awesome
2966000	2970000	Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week
2970000	2973000	God of War Chains of Olympus
2973000	2975000	Coming out on the PSP
2975000	2977000	That looks pretty awesome
2977000	2981000	Pets Bunnies for the DS
2981000	2983000	Yes, you too can raise bunnies now
2983000	2985000	Hooray
2985000	2987000	Let's see
2987000	2991000	Just a small little game called Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii
2991000	2993000	That will be coming out a week from today
2993000	2995000	Hooray
2995000	3000000	Ninja Reflex is coming out on the Wii and the DS this week
3000000	3002000	For your Ninja themed party games
3002000	3006000	World Championship Cards for the PSP
3006000	3008000	In case you want to play something other than poker
3008000	3014000	Mystery Dungeon Shiren the Wanderer coming out on the DS
3014000	3016000	Let's see
3016000	3023000	We've also got Spitfire Heroes Tales of the Royal Air Force
3023000	3025000	That's on DS as well
3025000	3029000	And Homies Rollers on the DS
3029000	3031000	You're like Homie the Clown
3031000	3035000	That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures
3035000	3037000	They can get out of those machines for 10 cents
3037000	3039000	Oh, my boss used to collect those
3039000	3044000	Let's see
3044000	3046000	I believe that's it
3046000	3048000	Smash Brothers Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week
3048000	3053000	I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance
3053000	3055000	But maybe there's a certain audience for that, I don't know
3055000	3057000	I will tell you what
3057000	3059000	Uh oh, what
3059000	3062000	If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies
3062000	3064000	Oh no, here we go, here we go
3064000	3068000	If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies, yes, what?
3068000	3071000	We'll do the whole Tingle thing and we'll burn Eye of Judgment
3071000	3074000	We'll need another game in there, just more of a chance
3074000	3077000	You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?
3077000	3079000	Yeah
3079000	3080000	Great
3080000	3083000	The makers of that game just thanked you for selling like, you know
3083000	3086000	About a hundred additional copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise
3086000	3089000	Here, I'll make it even more fair, the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever
3089000	3091000	Whoa, whoa, whoa
3091000	3095000	So the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment now
3095000	3096000	Yes
3096000	3099000	Because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell a hundred thousand copies
3099000	3101000	Somebody mark the date and time of this
3101000	3106000	Oh, it's almost exactly seven o'clock here on Sunday evening, March 2nd
3106000	3108000	It will never sell anything, okay, come on
3108000	3111000	Well that's something, that's giving the listeners
3111000	3114000	That's for the little meter some of the chatters made up
3114000	3118000	Some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that looks like a telethon thing
3118000	3120000	And it's like the road to one million copies
3120000	3121000	It'll never happen
3121000	3123000	Now it gives them something to add to that
3123000	3126000	It'll never ever happen
3126000	3129000	Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never ever sell
3129000	3131000	Here's the thing, chat room
3131000	3133000	You gotta get him, you keep adding games to it
3133000	3140000	Until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total
3140000	3143000	Oh yeah, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that
3143000	3145000	Gold Banjo says another one for the OLR wiki
3145000	3147000	I forgot to mention Housekeeping, this would have been good
3147000	3151000	They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio
3151000	3154000	And you can wiki stuff on it
3154000	3158000	Even though I guess, well we have an official Wikipedia article
3158000	3162000	But now we have our own freaking entire wiki
3162000	3165000	Which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really
3165000	3168000	You'd think I wrote it or Loki wrote that article
3168000	3171000	But we've never really worked on that
3171000	3174000	It was totally the fans that did that, so that was really cool
3174000	3176000	I haven't even seen it
3176000	3178000	On Wikipedia?
3178000	3181000	Oh, well I thought you meant, oh you meant on Wikipedia
3181000	3183000	Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia
3183000	3184000	A wiki set up for us
3184000	3187000	But now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki
3187000	3188000	That's what I was talking about
3188000	3191000	Yes, that, well I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out
3191000	3194000	It's orangeloungeradio.wikia
3194000	3196000	That's W-I-K-I-A dot com
3196000	3198000	So check it out, Orange Lounge Radio
3198000	3200000	And somebody just linked it in chat as well, so check that out
3200000	3203000	Alright, meanwhile, let's go back to traveling the globe
3203000	3205000	And looking at upcoming releases
3205000	3207000	And we'll start on the Xbox 360 in Japan
3207000	3209000	You get a new version of the console coming out
3209000	3211000	The Xbox 360 Arcade hits Japan
3211000	3213000	And with that comes some price reductions, yay
3213000	3216000	Including Riot Act, which you might know as Crackdown
3216000	3219000	And Saints Row gets some price reductions this week
3219000	3221000	On the Xbox 360 in Japan
3221000	3225000	Coming out on the Playstation 3, the DualShock 3 makes its way out there
3225000	3230000	As well as Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock finally comes out in Japan
3230000	3232000	The Satin Silver, that's what I was trying to think of earlier
3232000	3236000	The Satin Silver Playstation 3 comes out as well
3236000	3241000	Continuing our trip in Japan on the Nintendo Wii
3241000	3244000	Family Jockey comes out in Japan
3244000	3247000	Also Metroid Prime 3 Corruption
3247000	3251000	I did not realize this game had quite the delay between the US and Japan
3251000	3254000	But it is finally coming out in Japan this week
3254000	3257000	So I guess we're not the only ones that have to wait for big titles sometimes
3257000	3259000	It looks like Japan had to wait for this one
3259000	3260000	That's kind of surprised me
3260000	3262000	And I looked to see if it's a price reduction or something like that
3262000	3263000	It's not, it's full price
3263000	3265000	So this must be the first time they're getting that
3265000	3267000	So that kind of surprised me
3267000	3271000	Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin
3271000	3272000	And it comes with a
3272000	3273000	Nobunaga's ambition something
3273000	3274000	I don't
3274000	3275000	Online I think
3275000	3278000	But it comes with what's called a power-up kit
3278000	3281000	And I'm not exactly sure what a power-up kit has in it
3281000	3284000	So this is something they haven't released yet
3284000	3286000	Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games
3286000	3287000	Perhaps
3287000	3290000	The same thing with Double Kings or whatever they call that over there
3290000	3294000	I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes
3294000	3295000	It's drugs
3295000	3296000	Perhaps
3296000	3298000	But it does look like another version of Nobunaga's Ambition
3298000	3300000	Dang, the last time I played this game was on the NES
3300000	3302000	And look how far it's come
3302000	3304000	It's like Civilization
3304000	3306000	I remember Civ I, I have such fond memories
3306000	3308000	It has a Nobunaga's Ambition game that came out
3308000	3310000	The beginning of February
3310000	3312000	For PlayStation 2
3312000	3315000	Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore
3315000	3316000	They're too complicated for you
3316000	3318000	I'm not smart enough to play those games
3318000	3319000	I'll admit it
3319000	3321000	I think that's just exactly what it boils down to
3321000	3323000	They're too much for me now
3323000	3324000	They get too complicated
3324000	3327000	The Nobunaga's Ambition party game
3327000	3329000	Yeah, they need like
3329000	3331000	You know how they dumb down Madden for Wii owners?
3331000	3332000	That's what I need
3332000	3334000	I need a dumbed down version of Nobunaga's Ambition
3334000	3336000	Swing the remote down to conquer Japan
3339000	3341000	It's too bad they don't have achievement points
3341000	3343000	And I accidentally closed out my list
3343000	3345000	So I'll tell you what
3345000	3346000	Why don't we go to Europe and then we'll come back to Japan
3346000	3348000	Well you know what that actually makes me think?
3348000	3350000	Did we ever get a current gen release of Risk?
3350000	3352000	Not that I can think of
3352000	3354000	Wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?
3354000	3356000	It'd be cool if we had Risk and Axis and Allies
3356000	3357000	Wouldn't that be cool?
3357000	3358000	That would be very cool
3358000	3360000	I love games like that
3360000	3362000	Oh wait, I got the Japanese release dates back
3362000	3363000	Never mind
3363000	3365000	Europe can wait a little longer
3365000	3366000	They're used to it
3366000	3368000	That was me
3368000	3369000	It was
3369000	3370000	Below the bell
3370000	3371000	I'm sorry
3371000	3372000	Party foul
3372000	3373000	Dear European listeners
3373000	3375000	Please send Rob a smack in the head
3375000	3376000	Send me your cards and letters
3376000	3380000	Send me your cards and letters
3380000	3382000	Whatever, they get Mario Kart early
3382000	3383000	That's right
3383000	3385000	So, you know, shut up
3385000	3387000	Go stuff yourself with a crumpet
3387000	3388000	Hey
3390000	3392000	I love Britain
3392000	3393000	I love all of Europe
3393000	3394000	I love France
3394000	3395000	I love Spain
3395000	3396000	I love them all
3396000	3397000	Alright
3397000	3399000	On the PlayStation 2
3399000	3402000	Also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well
3402000	3403000	And guess what
3403000	3406000	There wasn't enough Pachinko in your life
3406000	3412000	Hisou Pachinko Pachi Slot Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well
3412000	3417000	By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of Pachinko
3417000	3421000	Because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that
3421000	3422000	On the Nintendo DS
3422000	3425000	Bomberman gets a price cut
3425000	3430000	Doraemon no Bitaton Midori no Kyojinen DS comes out
3430000	3433000	In other words, it's Doraemon on the DS yet again
3433000	3435000	And lastly on the PSP
3435000	3437000	And then I promise we can do the Europe dates
3437000	3441000	Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable
3441000	3444000	That is a combo kit of those games
3444000	3445000	It's like an Ultimate Hits
3445000	3446000	So there you have it
3446000	3449000	And also Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits
3449000	3451000	The Lenneth and what was the other one?
3451000	3454000	Slo-Mera or whatever it was called
3454000	3457000	They both move into the Greatest Hits collection
3457000	3460000	Alright, now that all of Britain hates me
3460000	3462000	And Europe in general
3462000	3464000	Let's go to their release dates, shall we Jamie?
3464000	3466000	Fine
3466000	3468000	Well these are all on the 7th
3468000	3470000	And one of them pisses me off
3470000	3472000	But I have a certain bias against it
3472000	3476000	Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
3476000	3479000	Blacksite Area 51 on PS3
3479000	3482000	Bully Scholarship Edition, Xbox 360 and Wii
3482000	3485000	Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed on Wii
3485000	3489000	Dynasty Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3
3489000	3491000	Jack Keane on PC
3491000	3495000	MX vs ATV Untamed on a bunch of crap
3495000	3498000	Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one
3498000	3500000	The Destiny of Zorro on Wii
3500000	3502000	Victorious Boxers on Wii
3502000	3506000	And the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K Dawn of War
3506000	3509000	Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?
3509000	3510000	Victorious
3510000	3512000	Oh Victorious, I thought you said Victorias
3512000	3515000	And I'm thinking like, is that like Victoria's Closet for men?
3515000	3516000	Like now they're expanding
3516000	3518000	I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls
3518000	3520000	You mean Victoria's Secret?
3520000	3521000	She has a penis?
3521000	3523000	No, I thought you said Victoria's Closet
3523000	3524000	Oh maybe
3524000	3526000	That was a really crappy show
3526000	3528000	That was Veronica's Closet, it was Chrissy Alley
3528000	3530000	No, Victoria's Secret
3530000	3533000	I thought I heard her say Victoria's Boxers
3533000	3537000	Maybe my mind is just focused on underwear right now, I don't know
3537000	3539000	See, you said Victoria's though
3539000	3541000	These boxers are victorious!
3541000	3543000	I'm thinking up Spice Girls
3545000	3549000	If they're a pair of boxers and on the back of them is a big peace sign
3549000	3552000	You know, like the V for victory or whatever
3552000	3554000	A hand doing a V
3554000	3556000	Please, let's change the topic
3556000	3558000	I hate Warhammer 40K
3558000	3560000	Why?
3560000	3565000	Because I had an ex who did nothing but play Warhammer 40K and paint his retarded little models
3565000	3568000	On and for days at a time
3568000	3571000	I tried painting those once and then I saw that they're 6mm tall
3571000	3574000	I'm like, fuck this, I am not doing this
3574000	3577000	And I'm a big gamer, I love gaming
3577000	3582000	But there just comes a point where there's this weird obsession with the little figures
3582000	3585000	And for building terrain from scratch
3585000	3587000	And that's all he ever did
3587000	3591000	So yeah, I broke up with him to play with, you know, to hang out with some guy that played rifts
3591000	3595000	It was fun though, running over those little figurines with a toy train
3595000	3598000	Because, you know, if you're going to build your own landscape
3598000	3602000	You might as well already have a train set and landscape built already for that
3602000	3605000	Well, I can understand having a project, that's one thing
3605000	3608000	But when your entire life is your project, that's a little something else
3608000	3610000	That and you didn't have a job
3610000	3613000	Speaking about building little figurines
3613000	3616000	Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spinoffs for different games
3616000	3618000	Including Indiana Jones and Star Wars
3618000	3623000	Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo
3623000	3626000	As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue
3626000	3630000	But they have screenshots to prove that it's real
3630000	3632000	You know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts
3632000	3634000	But, sure, if you want to believe
3634000	3636000	The minute I saw a headline that said
3636000	3641000	April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was
3641000	3644000	I was like, oh, haha, funny, April Fools joke
3644000	3645000	I hate April Fools
3645000	3646000	You know
3646000	3647000	Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
3647000	3649000	It would be cool if it were real
3649000	3650000	I don't think it is
3650000	3651000	And I don't think you would try
3651000	3652000	It's not, come on
3652000	3655000	You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine
3655000	3656000	You know
3656000	3659000	And, of course, it's their exclusive, they say
3659000	3660000	And stuff like that
3660000	3663000	Trust me, if this wasn't a real exclusive
3663000	3666000	1UP.com would be whoring the shit out of this
3666000	3667000	Right now, okay
3667000	3670000	Because they like to tease their exclusives
3670000	3671000	So
3671000	3672000	Whatever
3672000	3674000	You don't need any more Halo
3674000	3676000	Or Lego Halo
3676000	3679000	Well, I almost thought this was a joke when I first read about it too
3679000	3681000	But, no, it is true
3681000	3684000	And it's one of the more interesting types of development in gaming
3684000	3685000	I've heard in a long time
3685000	3686000	Okay, here's the thing
3686000	3690000	You know Treasure made a shooter years ago called Bongio
3690000	3691000	Bongio
3691000	3692000	Bongio
3692000	3693000	Which is not a classic game
3693000	3694000	Yeah, well, that's right
3694000	3696000	It's coming out on the DS, right
3696000	3697000	As Bongio Spirits
3697000	3698000	Yay
3698000	3699000	That's not the part I thought was a joke
3699000	3702000	Here's the part I thought was a joke
3702000	3705000	It uses what's called sound load
3705000	3707000	And what you do, you share custom levels
3707000	3709000	High scores and replay videos
3709000	3713000	But you don't do it using the built-in Wi-Fi or any of that
3713000	3714000	No, no
3714000	3715000	It's sound
3715000	3716000	That's right
3716000	3718000	Because the DS has a microphone and a speaker
3718000	3720000	I guess you put the DS's really close to each other
3720000	3724000	And what happens is that the data is turned into noises and sound
3724000	3727000	And it's played out the speaker of, you know, your DS
3727000	3729000	And then your friend picks it up on his microphone
3729000	3731000	Or his or her microphone DS
3731000	3733000	And turned back into game data
3733000	3734000	What a weird concept
3734000	3735000	And the other
3735000	3736000	It's Treasure
3736000	3737000	Treasure's
3737000	3738000	And the other thing you can do with this
3738000	3740000	Is you can put them in like MP3 format or whatever
3740000	3741000	And spread them out on the internet
3741000	3743000	So people can download them that way
3743000	3744000	It's Treasure
3744000	3748000	It's kind of neat, I'll admit
3748000	3749000	But I totally, like when I first read this
3749000	3751000	I'm like, this is the weirdest thing I've ever heard
3751000	3752000	But yeah, and then I'm thinking like
3752000	3755000	Wow, we could like put a custom level on our podcast
3755000	3758000	And be like, okay Bongio owners, turn on your
3758000	3760000	You know, and that's probably exactly what they want
3760000	3761000	Which is why this feature's in there, but
3761000	3762000	Let's do that
3762000	3764000	Because everybody loves listening to the sound of a modem
3764000	3765000	When you pick it up
3765000	3768000	Or if you put a CD in a regular
3768000	3771000	Or if you put an old CD-ROM in a regular CD player
3771000	3772000	And you're like
3772000	3773000	It was like
3773000	3776000	Did you ever put in the Symphony of the Night CD
3776000	3778000	And then listen to the hidden track?
3778000	3779000	Yeah, but the thing about PlayStation
3779000	3780000	Yes, I have done that
3780000	3782000	But the thing about PlayStation discs
3782000	3783000	Is for whatever reason
3783000	3785000	I don't know if this is the coding or whatever
3785000	3787000	But if you try to play track one on a PlayStation disc
3787000	3788000	It's silence
3788000	3790000	You won't hear the noise that you will
3790000	3791000	In like an old school
3791000	3794000	Like, go find yourself a copy of Encarta
3794000	3797000	And put it in a regular CD player
3797000	3799000	And if you know what I'm talking about
3799000	3800000	You're old school
3800000	3801000	Because we did this in junior high
3801000	3802000	We would take a copy of Encarta
3802000	3804000	And put it in a regular CD player
3804000	3805000	And it makes the most hideous noise
3805000	3806000	And what you do is
3806000	3808000	It was like the dumbass joke you would play
3808000	3810000	Is that you would turn the radio thing up
3810000	3811000	Full blast
3811000	3812000	Close the door
3812000	3813000	And run
3813000	3817000	Ah, yes
3817000	3820000	I just remember putting them in
3820000	3825000	Especially, they'd also do it on PC Engine duo discs
3825000	3827000	Who say, this is a game disc
3827000	3828000	Do not listen to this
3828000	3829000	Or your speakers will die
3829000	3831000	That type of thing
3831000	3834000	Very interesting feature
3834000	3835000	I almost
3835000	3837000	I have to admit
3837000	3838000	I kind of
3838000	3840000	Like, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought
3840000	3841000	To go run out and buy
3841000	3842000	Or even really check out
3842000	3844000	Just because there's too many other games on the table, right?
3844000	3845000	But now I'm kind of like
3845000	3847000	I might have to look at this game
3847000	3848000	Just for this feature
3848000	3849000	I'll tell you
3849000	3850000	In one word
3850000	3851000	Why I'm getting this game
3851000	3852000	Why?
3852000	3853000	Treasure
3853000	3855000	I should have known
3855000	3856000	Treasure
3856000	3857000	This whole reason why
3857000	3858000	I'm still looking for Chameleon Twist
3858000	3860000	Alright, well
3860000	3861000	Let's move on
3861000	3862000	That's all I have to say
3862000	3863000	Until the game comes out
3863000	3864000	Well, I know that
3864000	3866000	Quite a number of our listeners
3866000	3868000	Are into Rock Band
3868000	3871000	So, something that everyone should be happy about
3871000	3872000	Is that there is
3872000	3874000	A Grateful Dead pack
3874000	3876000	Coming out for Rock Band
3876000	3877000	That will have
3877000	3878000	China Cat Sunflower
3878000	3879000	Casey Jones
3879000	3880000	Sugar Magnolia
3880000	3881000	Trucken
3881000	3882000	Franklin's Tower
3882000	3883000	And I Need a Miracle
3883000	3885000	I think that that's
3885000	3886000	Pretty cool
3886000	3888000	Because, you know, Grateful Dead is pretty cool
3888000	3891000	Now, I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit
3891000	3894000	Because that would be the full dead experience right there
3894000	3895000	You know what?
3895000	3896000	You laugh about that
3896000	3897000	Apparently
3897000	3898000	Okay, one of my customers
3898000	3899000	Oh no
3899000	3900000	No, no, no, no
3900000	3901000	Not about the weed thing
3901000	3903000	No, one of my customers actually
3903000	3905000	Saw the kit set up
3905000	3907000	At one of the Game Stops to guest in
3907000	3911000	Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from
3911000	3915000	And it was actually pretty funny
3915000	3917000	He said it just looks like a fog machine with lights
3917000	3919000	And the lights basically hook up to your sound
3919000	3920000	They're all sound activated
3920000	3922000	Like, you know, your sound out
3922000	3925000	Or whatever your stereo system
3925000	3927000	And they react to the sound that you do
3927000	3928000	So we could do the show
3928000	3931000	And it would react to our speaking and stuff
3931000	3932000	Just what we need
3932000	3933000	And that would be funny
3933000	3934000	Alright, I'm sorry though
3934000	3935000	Well, there's a little bit more to this story
3935000	3936000	Hmm
3936000	3938000	For people who are not so rock band oriented
3938000	3942000	And are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented
3942000	3945000	Actually, No Doubt's having some releases on there
3945000	3947000	Which, No Doubt, cool
3947000	3949000	Gwen Stefani's solo, bad
3949000	3950000	Because she sucks
3950000	3952000	That and she's got mental problems
3952000	3953000	But, moving on
3953000	3954000	Wow, tell us what you really think
3954000	3956000	What songs are coming out from No Doubt?
3956000	3957000	Do we know?
3957000	3958000	Don't Speak
3958000	3959000	Excuse Me Mister
3959000	3960000	And Sunday Morning
3960000	3962000	So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend
3962000	3963000	That's the song I love
3963000	3964000	No
3964000	3965000	No Just a Girl
3965000	3966000	No Spiderwebs
3966000	3969000	But, I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list
3969000	3970000	So I'm happy
3970000	3971000	What song is that?
3971000	3972000	Don't Speak
3972000	3973000	Don't Speak
3973000	3974000	Alright, let's hear some clips of these songs
3974000	3975000	That are coming to rock band very soon
3975000	3977000	Here's a clip of the Grateful Dead
3977000	3979000	So, if you got them, smoke them
3979000	3996000	Just kidding that's bad
3996000	4000000	Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in rock band
4000000	4004000	And then we have coming to
4004000	4006000	Not coming to Grateful Dead
4006000	4008000	Coming to Guitar Hero 3
4008000	4010000	We have No Doubt
4010000	4012000	And I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak
4012000	4014000	So let's play one of the more lesser known songs
4014000	4016000	Which would be Sunday Morning
4016000	4022000	Sappy Pathetic Little Me
4022000	4028000	That was the girl I used to be
4028000	4034000	You had me on my knees
4034000	4038000	I'm glad I breathed some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and rock band in general
4038000	4042000	Rock band, the wheels keep on turning with that game
4042000	4044000	Proud Mary keep on burning?
4044000	4045000	I don't know
4045000	4046000	Not yet, maybe someday
4046000	4047000	Anyhow
4047000	4049000	And not to be outdone
4049000	4054000	From the studio that brings you Hannah Montana
4054000	4057000	Disney has announced a brand new game for the
4057000	4059000	Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert
4059000	4060000	No!
4060000	4062000	It's Ultimate Band
4062000	4064000	You know, fuck this rock band shit
4064000	4066000	It's the Ultimate Band
4066000	4069000	And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS
4069000	4072000	One thing though that you will be happy to know
4072000	4075000	And maybe this might be a sad thing
4075000	4077000	Is that there will not be any peripherals for this game
4077000	4079000	It'll be all with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck
4079000	4083000	So you have to imagine how you're gonna actually play these songs
4083000	4087000	They have a screenshot that shows apparently the guitar portion of the game
4087000	4092000	Which looks like it's gonna use the two buttons on the nunchuck as your fret buttons
4092000	4095000	So you have two fret buttons
4095000	4097000	You have one, two, zero, or both
4097000	4100000	This sounds like Ultimate Suck
4100000	4102000	You know what?
4102000	4104000	I'm gonna say something pretty daring here
4104000	4107000	I think this actually isn't a bad idea
4107000	4109000	Because think about who this game is aimed at
4109000	4110000	It's aimed at kids
4110000	4113000	And parents don't want to spend all this freakin' money
4113000	4115000	On all these peripherals that their kids are gonna destroy
4115000	4117000	So you know what? If you've got a Wii
4117000	4122000	Why not come out with a game that's very similar to Rock Band
4122000	4125000	But that you don't have to buy all this extra shit for
4125000	4127000	And of course I'm not gonna like it
4127000	4129000	Probably Jamie, Matt, they're not gonna like it
4129000	4130000	It's not really made for us
4130000	4131000	I'll try it
4131000	4132000	It's a kids game
4132000	4134000	I don't think I'd buy this game
4134000	4135000	But I'll try it
4135000	4140000	It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays
4140000	4143000	And the DS version will have that brand new
4143000	4145000	CD gamer online social network
4145000	4147000	Which is sounding pretty awesome
4147000	4149000	And I really kind of want to check it out
4149000	4151000	But that means I have to buy a Disney DS game
4151000	4153000	And I don't know
4153000	4154000	ActDeft in chat says
4154000	4156000	Skye speaks the truth
4156000	4157000	And GS68 says
4157000	4158000	Skye is right
4158000	4160000	Ego++
4160000	4162000	The chat room actually just reminded me
4162000	4164000	Of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming week
4164000	4165000	What's that?
4165000	4166000	Oh I bought Parappa
4166000	4167000	Oh rad
4167000	4168000	For $15
4168000	4170000	At a Hollywood going out of business
4170000	4173000	Let's see, RasteelUT says
4173000	4177000	Skye, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the Flames will disagree
4177000	4178000	Yeah well he's a freak
4178000	4181000	Hey did I just call a 7 year old a freak?
4181000	4182000	Cool
4182000	4183000	That's fine, he's a freak
4183000	4185000	Uni in chat says
4185000	4188000	Kids already nom nom the hell out of the Wii remote
4188000	4193000	Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii remote and hid it under the couch
4193000	4198000	If you're 7 year old nom noms the Wii remote and hides it under the couch
4198000	4199000	You got issues
4199000	4201000	I don't like that phrase, that's funny
4201000	4202000	What, nom nom?
4202000	4203000	Nom nom
4204000	4205000	Didn't you hear?
4205000	4208000	Everything is Caturday now, everything
4208000	4209000	Lolcat speak
4209000	4212000	Cronkyboyjr tries to put out a zinger here saying
4212000	4214000	You mean we save money on Wii peripherals?
4214000	4215000	Ba dum bum
4215000	4216000	Get it?
4216000	4217000	Because the remotes are so fucking expensive
4217000	4219000	You don't really have real Wii peripherals
4219000	4223000	I mean after all there's like what, the classic controller and the nunchuck
4223000	4224000	That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii
4224000	4229000	Everything else is plastic shit
4229000	4231000	Alright well
4231000	4234000	You know a lot of folks are very excited about this
4234000	4236000	I'm sure Mo, remember Mo from a couple weeks ago?
4236000	4237000	Yes
4237000	4239000	I'm sure she's very excited about this
4239000	4242000	Still Alive is going to be coming to Rock Band
4242000	4245000	And Valve threw a little party at Game Developers Conference
4245000	4251000	And get this, some guy actually tried to steal the song
4251000	4254000	Here's how it worked, Jonathan Colton was up on stage with his band
4254000	4256000	They were playing Still Alive but in Rock Band
4256000	4259000	Because apparently he didn't get 100% on vocals
4259000	4260000	Which is ironically hilarious
4260000	4261000	But whatever
4261000	4264000	So they finish, crowd is cheering
4264000	4269000	And what happens is that this guy from the crowd gets up on stage
4269000	4272000	Walks over to the 360, pulls out a memory card
4272000	4275000	Which I don't know who carries 360 memory cards with them on the go
4275000	4278000	I mean back in the day I used to carry a Playstation memory card
4278000	4280000	When I go to the arcade and stuff
4280000	4282000	Because DDR machines had the memory card slots
4282000	4284000	You could have two or three of those
4284000	4287000	I can't think of any reason why you would put a 360 card in your pocket everywhere you go
4287000	4289000	But whatever, it's Game Developers Conference, whatever
4289000	4291000	So he pulls out this memory card
4291000	4293000	He puts it in, messes around
4293000	4296000	And then finally one of the Harmonix guys walks over
4296000	4297000	And says what's going on
4297000	4299000	And this guy says I'm just grabbing Still Alive
4299000	4301000	Everyone needs to be able to play this
4301000	4303000	Well the developer took it back
4303000	4306000	And deleted the thing off the card
4306000	4307000	And all is well
4307000	4309000	Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway
4309000	4311000	Because it was probably a dev 360
4311000	4313000	And I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild
4313000	4315000	It wouldn't have worked anyways
4315000	4317000	Because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management
4317000	4319000	Which we'll get into later
4319000	4321000	Well apparently the guy actually wrote about it
4321000	4324000	The only reason I'm not giving this idiot of the week award
4324000	4326000	Or stupid guy of the week
4326000	4328000	Or whatever we're calling it in your award
4328000	4331000	Is because apparently the guy wrote about it in his live journal
4331000	4334000	And I don't know, don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate
4334000	4336000	It could be fanfic or some shit
4336000	4337000	I don't know
4337000	4339000	But I think it's legit
4339000	4341000	You can check it out on his live journal
4341000	4345000	It's algorithmancy.livejournal.com
4345000	4350000	That's A-L-G-O-R-I-T-A-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com
4350000	4352000	And he writes in this entry on February 21, 2008
4352000	4354000	He writes his side of the story
4354000	4356000	And he puts a disclaimer at the end
4356000	4358000	He says don't try this at home
4358000	4359000	The only reason I did
4359000	4361000	Because I am an acquaintance of Alex
4361000	4362000	Who works at Harmonix
4362000	4364000	As well as good friends with several Harmonix folks
4364000	4367000	And game industry friends give each other free swag all the time
4367000	4371000	Remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material is theft
4371000	4372000	So
4372000	4374000	You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?
4374000	4375000	Huh
4375000	4376000	He's got a cool live journal name
4376000	4377000	That's it
4379000	4381000	It was kind of a dumb thing to do
4381000	4382000	But at least he admits it was a little
4382000	4384000	It was a lot of a dumb thing to do
4384000	4386000	At least he kind of admits in his live journal thing
4386000	4387000	That it was a lot of dumb
4387000	4388000	So you know
4388000	4390000	I'm not going to stupid award him
4390000	4392000	When he begs for mercy
4392000	4394000	That's what you get when you drink lots of alcohols
4394000	4395000	Exactly
4395000	4396000	Alcohol bad
4398000	4399000	But still alive
4399000	4400000	Good
4400000	4401000	Alright, before we wrap up
4401000	4402000	Huh, what's that?
4402000	4403000	I said quite
4403000	4404000	Before we wrap
4404000	4406000	Are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in the studio?
4406000	4407000	No
4407000	4408000	Did you hear our idea
4408000	4409000	I don't remember if this is the week you were gone
4409000	4411000	Because February was all fucked up
4411000	4413000	But were you here the week we had the idea
4413000	4414000	That when it comes out
4414000	4415000	We'll get Mo back
4415000	4416000	And she'll be our vocalist
4416000	4417000	And we'll get Matt to play drums
4417000	4418000	You can play guitar
4418000	4420000	You and I can work out the guitar somehow
4420000	4421000	And we'll have an OR band
4421000	4422000	And we'll do our rendition
4422000	4423000	It was mentioned last week
4423000	4424000	Was it last week?
4424000	4425000	I can't remember
4425000	4426000	I'm getting old and the weeks blend together
4426000	4427000	That's okay Rob
4427000	4428000	Alright
4428000	4429000	Anyhow
4429000	4431000	I'm still bringing you your birthday present
4431000	4432000	Sweet
4432000	4433000	Alright
4433000	4435000	Speaking of getting old
4435000	4436000	The older we get
4436000	4438000	The more we reminisce about the classic games
4438000	4440000	And that's why we like to pay tribute
4440000	4443000	To the classic game of the week every week
4443000	4445000	Dark Sakura likes to respect her elders
4445000	4446000	In the gaming world
4446000	4449000	By paying tribute to old classic games
4449000	4453000	So let's dust off a dusty game
4453000	4455000	And see what Dark Sakura's picked
4455000	4456000	For this week's classic game of the week
4456000	4457000	What is it?
4457000	4460000	This is actually one of my favorite arcade games ever
4460000	4462000	And I have it on Saturn
4462000	4465000	It's Cyber Troopers Virtual On
4465000	4470000	Which is a 3D robot fighting game
4470000	4471000	Done from a behind the view
4471000	4474000	Of your own character who you're playing
4474000	4483000	Let's take a listen
4483000	4490000	And almost every other sample of it online was horrible
4490000	4491000	So moving forward
4491000	4494000	You basically play as a virtualoid
4494000	4499000	A giant robot controlled by a person
4499000	4501000	Which is actually pretty funny
4501000	4505000	Because there are little insert things
4505000	4507000	Where the pilots go in the back of the market for Saturn
4507000	4509000	In the sequel Virtual On
4509000	4512000	Oritario Tangrum was a dreamcast
4512000	4514000	Which I have that game too and I got it
4514000	4518000	But you would play as a number of them
4518000	4519000	With different specialties
4519000	4521000	Like you have the Temjin
4521000	4523000	Which is the balanced one
4523000	4525000	You have the Raiden
4525000	4527000	Which is a heavy battle one
4527000	4531000	Really strong and heavily armed
4531000	4534000	You have the Amp Arms
4534000	4539000	Which is one of the fast ones
4539000	4541000	It uses a tom-po weapon
4541000	4543000	You have Belgor
4543000	4546000	Which is a missile launcher
4546000	4547000	The Dorcas
4547000	4550000	Which is another pretty heavy one
4550000	4552000	The Viper 2
4552000	4553000	The Basbal Bow
4553000	4557000	And my favorite which is the Feiyen
4557000	4559000	Which is like the cute world
4559000	4560000	The Mecha
4560000	4562000	Which is really fast and nice
4562000	4563000	You have the Z-Grat
4563000	4565000	And then you have the Jaguarladi
4565000	4567000	Which is as far as I remember
4567000	4569000	I think it was one of the hidden ones
4569000	4573000	But in the arcade you had a 2% set up
4573000	4575000	And it had a dividing wall in between
4575000	4577000	So you were like in the cockpit
4577000	4581000	And it used two sticks to control it
4581000	4584000	And on Saturn they did release the twin sticks
4584000	4586000	And I actually don't have them
4586000	4588000	Which makes me very upset
4588000	4589000	Because I had a chance to get them
4589000	4593000	They did do an Oratorio Tangram
4593000	4594000	That was on the Dreamcast
4594000	4596000	I actually do have the twin sticks for that
4596000	4598000	In fact, you remember your ex-roommate?
4598000	4599000	Yes
4599000	4601000	We beat him getting them
4601000	4603000	Interesting
4603000	4606000	We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento
4606000	4607000	Whoa, whoa, whoa
4607000	4609000	We're not talking about the one I lived with
4609000	4610000	Oh, we're talking about that room
4610000	4611000	That roommate
4611000	4612000	Wow
4612000	4614000	Those were the days, man
4614000	4615000	Those were the days
4615000	4616000	The guy who sold it to us
4616000	4617000	Ended up being
4617000	4618000	My husband
4618000	4620000	Ended up being
4620000	4625000	I do believe Mo's manager
4625000	4626000	It's
4626000	4627000	You know, I know
4627000	4630000	We're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town
4630000	4632000	But at any rate
4632000	4633000	We came in
4633000	4635000	We saw the twin sticks for 45 bucks
4635000	4637000	Which was astounding at that time
4637000	4638000	And like
4638000	4639000	We want to buy these right now
4639000	4640000	And I was like
4640000	4641000	Okay
4641000	4642000	And then
4642000	4643000	A person who's
4643000	4644000	As far as I knew
4644000	4645000	His nickname
4645000	4649000	Came from this game
4649000	4651000	Came in and we beat him by like 10 minutes
4651000	4652000	So
4652000	4653000	There were also other versions
4653000	4654000	There was
4654000	4655000	Cyber Troopers
4655000	4656000	Virtual on Force
4656000	4658000	That was only in Japanese arcades in 2001
4658000	4659000	And
4659000	4660000	Virtual on Mars
4660000	4661000	Which was
4661000	4663000	The PS2 release
4663000	4664000	So
4664000	4666000	There's also an audio drama for it
4666000	4669000	Which is kind of funny
4669000	4671000	And then there was a musical one
4671000	4672000	Which was the
4672000	4674000	The Feiyun robot singing
4674000	4677000	I actually have a Feiyun garage kit that I still have yet to put together
4677000	4679000	That I bought like six years ago
4679000	4680000	Nice
4680000	4681000	Virtual on's like
4681000	4683000	Tops
4683000	4684000	Alright
4684000	4685000	Well that's going to do it
4685000	4686000	Your classic game of the week
4686000	4688000	Virtual on
4688000	4689000	Here on Orange Lawn's radio
4689000	4690000	And on that note
4690000	4691000	We're going to go ahead and take a break
4691000	4693000	It is the end of part A
4693000	4694000	That's right
4694000	4695000	It's not a short show this week
4695000	4696000	We're all here
4696000	4698000	It's like you're finally getting a full OLR
4698000	4699000	Now it's like three weeks later
4699000	4700000	After
4700000	4701000	Jamie being sick
4701000	4702000	Us having no show
4702000	4703000	And then having a short show
4703000	4704000	The month of February was screwed
4704000	4706000	But there's plenty more of
4706000	4707000	Regular
4707000	4708000	Good old fashioned
4708000	4709000	Hopefully unbroken
4709000	4710000	OLR left
4710000	4711000	To go
4711000	4713000	Lots of stories coming up in part B
4713000	4715000	If you thought part A was PlayStation heavy
4715000	4716000	Which it was
4716000	4717000	Because there was a lot of PlayStation news this week
4717000	4718000	Which
4718000	4720000	Hopefully those people that email us every now and then say
4720000	4722000	You don't show Sony enough love
4722000	4723000	You guys hate Sony
4723000	4724000	Hopefully
4724000	4725000	We did you wrong tonight
4725000	4726000	We have plenty of Sony
4726000	4727000	Sony stories tonight
4727000	4728000	But in the next segment
4728000	4730000	Lots of Nintendo news came out as well
4730000	4732000	So we'll be getting all the Nintendo news in the next segment
4732000	4734000	And some other randomness
4734000	4735000	Such as
4735000	4737000	What is the guy that created Pong up to now?
4737000	4738000	You might be surprised
4738000	4739000	So we're going to take a quick break
4739000	4742000	And we'll be right back with more of Orange Lawn's radio
4742000	4743000	Right after this
4743000	4744000	Orange
4744000	4745000	Lawn's
4745000	4746000	Radio
4746000	4747000	Hi guys
4747000	4749000	It's Rob here with an important footnote
4749000	4751000	For our podcast listeners
4751000	4753000	There's no easy way for me to break the news
4753000	4755000	But part B this week was lost
4755000	4757000	And unfortunately won't be hitting the podcast feed
4757000	4759000	And you won't get that news we promised
4759000	4760000	Unless you were listening live
4760000	4763000	And heard all two hours of it being taped
4763000	4764000	So I'm sure you're wondering
4764000	4765000	What happened?
4765000	4767000	Well what happened is that we were
4767000	4768000	Taping the shows we always do
4768000	4770000	We do a special little show after that called The Afterbirth
4770000	4772000	It's only for live listeners
4772000	4774000	And because we play licensed music and stuff
4774000	4775000	That we can't put on the podcast
4775000	4777000	And as we were taping that
4777000	4778000	Right at the very end
4778000	4781000	We were trying to unjumble some of the chords back here
4781000	4784000	And the power cord to the computer got detached
4784000	4786000	And the whole damn thing shut off
4786000	4790000	And although Audition keeps a temporary file on hand
4790000	4792000	When I went in to recover the file
4792000	4794000	I'm in a mistake and ended up deleting the damn files
4794000	4796000	I was trying to make a backup copy of it
4796000	4797000	And I've tried everything
4797000	4798000	I can't get
4798000	4799000	It's not in the recycle bin
4799000	4801000	Picked the chat room's brain on it
4801000	4802000	It's gone
4802000	4803000	It ain't coming back
4803000	4805000	So I'm very sorry
4805000	4807000	And just when I was thinking March wouldn't be as broken as February
4807000	4809000	Anyhow
4809000	4810000	I guess one silver lining to this
4810000	4812000	Is that if you do want to hear part B
4812000	4814000	It is still archived on the Justin TV channel
4814000	4817000	So you can go to Justin.tv slash Orange Launch Radio
4817000	4820000	And I believe some of our listeners are trying to make a highlight of the show right now
4820000	4825000	Now it's become this big lost archive of the show
4825000	4827000	It's like a collector's item of sorts
4827000	4829000	We will try to get an audio rip of that
4829000	4831000	We're probably not going to put it on the podcast feed
4831000	4834000	Because the audio quality on Justin TV is not great
4834000	4836000	Our microphones don't hook into that
4836000	4838000	It simply goes to our webcam
4838000	4840000	And the audio is really not great
4840000	4842000	We'll probably, if anything, if we can get an audio rip of that
4842000	4845000	We'll probably put it on MySpace, Facebook, and all that stuff
4845000	4848000	Unfortunately part A, as all the podcast listeners are going to get this week
4848000	4850000	I am so sorry
4850000	4852000	In six years that we've been doing this show
4852000	4854000	We've never lost a show like that
4854000	4856000	So it's kind of embarrassing
4856000	4858000	And a little sad
4858000	4861000	Especially off of a few broken weeks in a row
4861000	4862000	But what can you do?
4862000	4863000	Life goes on
4863000	4865000	I hope everybody has a wonderful week
4865000	4866000	Happy gaming
4866000	4869000	And we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week
4869000	4871000	With all new power chords in studio
4871000	4896000	Have a good one
