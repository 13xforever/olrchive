00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Mojo.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, March 9th, 2008, is Smash Bros malfunctioning on some Wii's?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
More car and track information is released for Gran Turismo 5.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Spore gets a port to an unlikely gaming platform.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and, wait for it, the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hi.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And how are you, Miss Summers?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Meaty.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Meaty? Mmm, so meaty.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What exactly are you eating tonight?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm eating a protein-style cheeseburger from In-N-Out.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Mmm, yum.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This isn't my mic.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, I think you have Loki's. That's alright.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hey.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You know, the technical difficulties just couldn't end with last week.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I feel better.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Alright, there you go. You feel complete now?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I do.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, well let me introduce Tech Master Loki real quick and then we'll talk about last week.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, now with proper mic.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, I have the proper mic.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How are you, Loki?

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good. I'm just untangling the mic on the mixing board so I don't pull it and it turns all the knobs on there.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I know. We have to be like ultra, like, make sure everything is in its proper place tonight after last week.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Alright, so yeah, I'm sure you guys all heard the epilogue at the end of last week's Part A.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Those of you guys that were listening on the podcast anyway, those of you guys that are live tonight, Sunday,

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
joining us in our chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com, nothing happened for you.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You guys heard the show as always, but unfortunately the folks who listened to us on the podcast,

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
they didn't get Part B last week because right after it was done and we were in our final segment,

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the computer got unplugged, I made a boo-boo and zapped the temp file so we couldn't really save it.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, what's kind of cool though is that one of our listeners, this is J100Matt,

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
actually was able to retrieve the audio directly out of the Justin TV cam, but the quality kind of stinks

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
because it's all based off the iSight cam that we use for Justin TV, which is a completely different computer.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's actually a laptop, and you can't really hear Jamie at all because Jamie, well, I mean you can,

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
but she's just really quiet because she's the furthest away from it, and yeah, I don't know.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That may be a positive or a minus depending.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jamie, rebuttal.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All right.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Loki gets smacked with a large trout or whatever the old MIRC thing is.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Anyhow, so yeah, we'll release the kind of cruddy audio part B like on our Facebook and MySpace and all that stuff.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll try to get that up tomorrow just for those folks that really want to hear it,

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but for the rest of you guys, it's just another broken show, what can we say?

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But we're hoping tonight is working.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We're back to our normal selves.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a new month.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The weather's getting warmer again.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We're off to a good start because the network is actually working the way it's supposed to.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We didn't have to jerry-rig a whole second network setup,

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
so we're hoping we are ready to talk games for our full part A and part B tonight,

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
so I will shut up and turn it over to DarkSakura who will talk about her gaming week.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My gaming week was almost nonexistent except for, of course, Ragnarok

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
because I've been very busy trying to get a few things ready and had a few hang-ups come in the way,

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
but I think I'm going to actually be able to play more stuff next week.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's good. Sometimes real life gets in the way of gaming. That's okay.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sometimes people can't hold the controller.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Gotcha.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well then, Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week?

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It was okay.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I played Orange Box on the PC because I have had it for a while and I haven't actually tried it.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It looks nice on the PC, but it's exactly the same.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, yeah. Mainly Portal, because that's actually all I got, so it's just Portal.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then I've been playing a little bit of Smash Bros. Brawl.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm 30% way through the subspace emissary, so that's pretty fun.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And then, what else? I think I may have played some Patapon. That's about it.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Tell me a little bit more about Patapon because I was reading some stuff about it

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and it actually sounds like something I kind of want to play. Sounds kind of cool.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's kind of neat. It's basically, I mean, sort of, it's not really a rhythm music game,

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but you have to keep rhythm with these drums and depending on what four-note sequence you play,

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
they will do different things.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Like if you have an attack sequence, you have march forward, retreat, that kind of stuff.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So you just kind of strategize with that and keep in time at the same time.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The other thing that I did wasn't really playing games, but I got to view a lot of games

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and that was we had our Eidos rep come out and talk to us a bit about the stuff that they covered

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
during Destination PlayStation.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And we got to see some really cool stuff including an unreleased trailer for Tomb Raider Legends,

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
or not Tomb Raider Legends, Tomb Raider Underworld with gameplay footage on it and it looks awesome.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Absolutely awesome. They did some new motion capturing for everything.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Really? Because, pardon my skepticism, but I have failed to get excited about Tomb Raider in about ten years.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's about as awesome as Uncharted, maybe.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know. I'm not that excited about Uncharted, but it really does look good.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can't get excited about Tomb Raider because it's just not my thing, but it looks good.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't know. I wouldn't buy it though, but it looks good for people who like Tomb Raider.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Not me. I don't like Tomb Raider.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I like throwing her off a cliff and killing her and that's about it.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But I'm sure you can do that and it will look much nicer.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So that's it.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Other cool stuff I saw. There's a game. I hope I get the title right.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I think it's called Little Ninjas and it looks really cool.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's kind of a cross between almost like Okami and...

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't really know what else. Maybe Pirates vs. Ninjas or something like that.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Volleyball or Dodgeball or whatever.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Very cute little ninjas and they're fighting bad guys and stuff like that.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
All kind of cel-shaded. It looks really neat.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So that will be coming out next year, unfortunately.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And then I got to see some gameplay of the new Death Junior that they're doing for the Wii.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It actually looks pretty good.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hopefully it won't suck like the rest of them, but I'm pretty confident.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And then the one I was kind of excited about for the...

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Wait, I have a quick question. I thought Death Junior was a Konami license.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why is Eidos doing it now?

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Different publisher. It's the company owned...

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, gotcha. Sorry. Yeah, that's right. Konami just published someone else's game.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I wonder why they decided not to do this one.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know. Maybe the last two sucked for them and they dropped the publisher and Eidos picked them up. Who knows.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I also got to see some pretty cool footage of Gauntlet for the DS.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's going to be cool. I wish they'd put it on live.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But it's like a cross between the original Gauntlet and Gauntlet Legends.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's still top-down like the original Gauntlet, but it's all 3D and stuff like Legends was.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The cool thing about it though, four-player Wi-Fi co-op and there's voice chat involved with that as well.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So at least they're doing that right. So that'll be a pretty good purchase.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I've got to catch up on some comments from Chat Room because we have lots of good stuff tonight.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
chat.orangelaunchrader.com if you want to join us.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
DKJunior92 says, Uncharted is way better than Tomb Raider and you can kill him.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
DMN says, Gauntlet DS equals sex. I will make love to it.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
GS68 says, too many gaming publications credit the publisher and not the developer.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And you're right. I just made the same mistake. I'm sorry.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's okay. Then there's some other cool stuff I wasn't aware of like the series and stuff like Shell Shock 2 they showed us.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Which I guess that's like a survivor horror game set in NOM. It's like Condemned in NOM, I guess.

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And then there's this other Looney Tunes game that was a complete rip-off of Elite Beat Agents.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I mean, completely a rip-off of Elite Beat Agents. Except I don't know about the music though.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The music is like out of Looney Tunes so it's all that orchestrated stuff.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Not necessarily that but I think it did look kind of hard but it's exactly like Elite Beat Agents.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I mean, if you play Elite Beat Agents this will be easy for you.

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So that's pretty much it. That was my gaming week. It was kind of exciting though to get to see everything.

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And I got to talk to her but she offered us, well at least me and my co-worker, to go tour Eidos.

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's see if I can drag other people on.

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Aren't they going to make you sign all kinds of papers where you can't talk about it here though?

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No, they're just like... She was talking about, for example, showing us storyboards for Tomb Raider and stuff like that.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's cool.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't know. All the stuff was pretty much announced. Obviously I don't have the trailer for Tomb Raider Underworld or anything like that.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's the stuff that wasn't shown. I mean, kind of shown behind closed doors type thing.

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't know. It looks pretty good. I don't know. Just Cause 2 looks exciting.

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But I like the first one so I'm looking forward to those Grand Theft Auto type of games.

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Alright. Sounds like there's a lot coming out for you.

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Good fourth quarter for them. That's pretty good because Eidos in the past has been a few games.

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Been a little bit iffy.

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's been a rough ride.

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's been a rough ride?

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah.

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well good. I'm glad to see them getting back on track.

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hey Jamie, I got a question for you because I know you're a fan of Elite Beat Agents, right?

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What do you think about the whole Looney Tunes franchise completely knocking it off?

150
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I think it's stupid.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You think it's stupid? Too much of a good thing?

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well...

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a copy of a copy?

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah. I think that if they were going to do something it would be better for them to do something original.

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But who knows? I mean obviously it can't be just a straight up rip off, right Loki?

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's got to have some original stuff in it.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Basically what it does is it recreates the different cartoons. Like very famous cartoon scenes or whatever.

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And so you're playing the music though with the cartoon.

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That's kind of cool.

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh okay. That might actually be kind of neat.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I mean if you've got like the whole thing going on there where the cartoon's going on.

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Because Elite Beat Agents is kind of like that in a way, but it's different.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It just kind of controls exactly the same. Like if you looked at the interface and how the different spots where you tap and stuff, it looks exactly the same.

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And who knows? I haven't looked at the developer. Maybe it's the same developer. You never know.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Well GS68 in our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com, sums it up.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Looney Tunes Oh and Don, do not want...

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's what a GS68 says in our chat.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Going on to my gaming week, I've been playing lots of World of Warcraft.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Because I'm addicted.

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And our guild has been just tearing the shit out of Karazhan.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Which is our new thing is that we've been raiding Karazhan.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Trying to slowly clear our way through it.

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And I think we're doing pretty well for a group of noobs.

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I think we've cleared like seven of the bosses.

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So we're almost there.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Also in other gaming news, of course, I also played the hell out of Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
When did we get that? Wednesday?

178
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So we were lucky enough to get it a couple days early.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And was playing it a little bit on Justin.tv.

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So those of you guys that keep an eye on what we're doing.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Got a little sneak peek on Wednesday.

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And goddamn, I'm having a lot of fun with Super Smash.

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But now that I can actually understand it, as opposed to the Japanese version, like what's going on.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm having a lot of fun.

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What I do think is interesting is that whole subspace emissary mode.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Obviously I don't want to spoil a whole lot of what's going on.

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But I think what's interesting is that the cutscenes use no dialogue whatsoever.

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There's no dialogue whatsoever in the cutscenes.

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Everything is more of an emotional reaction.

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There's no words.

191
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Which is very interesting.

192
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The whole story is kind of told with the music.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. It's just interesting.

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's a cost saving thing.

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It is totally a cost saving thing.

196
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So they don't have to pay voice actors and they don't have to pay other voice actors to translate what they're saying.

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I gotta say though, I am pretty freaking impressed that it has a pretty fairly fleshed out single player mode.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Melee had its own kind of single player mode that was kind of cool.

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And certainly I remember when I played that first world in the single player mode, the Mushroom Kingdom thing,

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I was like, they need to do a Mario game just like this on the GameCube.

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And of course they never did.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Well, I don't know, Paper Mario on the Wii is kind of rad like that, but I don't know.

203
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But just seeing what they did with the single player mode here and really making it a game.

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's not like the greatest single player game ever.

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And you sort of have to really suspend disbelief to make the story work.

206
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Because they really did kind of have to put all these characters in a blender and kind of pull a story out of their butts.

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But it works.

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It does the fanboy service and that's really what this game is all about.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And I'll tell you what, it's very comprehensive fanboy service.

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Because not only do you have all these characters, you have all the stickers.

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Which, I mean, I think I got a sticker today for Mouser, one of the bosses in Super Mario 2.

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I mean, there's some obscure shit in those things.

213
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Like, I was getting things from Advance Wars I never even heard of because I didn't play a lot of that series.

214
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's just Nintendo fanboy wet dream, this game is.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And you know what, even if you're not like a Super Nintendo fanboy, it's a great party game.

216
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Which, duh, it's a Wii game.

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And the Wii has a lot of great party games and this is no exception.

218
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because I was playing a little bit, three players the other night.

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Which is funny because one of us was on the Wii with Nunchuck.

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
One of us was on the Wii with Classic Controller and the other one was using a GameCube controller.

221
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So it's kind of fun.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Online mode I haven't gotten to test a whole lot.

223
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Because obviously nobody had it on Wednesday, which is when I did most of my playing.

224
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I tried to add one of our other folks here on Orange Launch Radio who also had the game.

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But it wasn't working, I don't know why.

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Maybe it wasn't, maybe it wasn't up and running, I don't know.

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But I will, I want to point out that we have a friend code thread over on our forums.

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to add everybody on there later today.

229
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And try to maybe bring out Justin.tv this evening and try to fight some folks, Orange Launch Radio listeners.

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes, and we can use my map if I can swap it with somebody.

231
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because, you know, I made a cool map.

232
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's called the Cage Match.

233
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Nice, I see what you did there.

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Alright, let's see, what else do I want to talk about in my gaming week?

235
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Really quickly, I want to mention Trigger Heart Excellica.

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Because I think a lot of people totally skipped this game.

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Because it was an Xbox Live Arcade release.

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But I'll tell you what, if you like your Japanese shooters, this is as cliche of a Japanese shooter as they come.

239
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I mean, this is, which is a good thing for the Xbox 360.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Because, you know, I think about, hmm, what good like Japanese influenced shooter games are there on the Xbox 360?

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And you know what, I come up short.

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So Trigger Heart Excellica certainly fills a void.

243
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's actually based off a arcade game, which I hadn't heard of.

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because I don't play a lot of games in these types of series.

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I had it on soundtrack, so I knew it existed.

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But it's fun.

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I mean, bullets everywhere.

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I mean, like your typical Japanese shooter.

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Bullets everywhere.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You play a lot of Japanese shooters?

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Dark Sakura?

252
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Do you play one?

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I did.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Have you ever heard of this one, Trigger Heart Excellica?

255
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes.

256
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, it's good times.

257
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If you like that, I was going to say in April there's Castle of Shikigami 3 is coming out in the Wii.

258
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So, that would be another good one.

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think it's definitely worth a look, Trigger Heart Excellica.

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I did not spend the money on the full purchase, but I might later on.

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Now I'm kind of at the point with Xbox 360 arcade games where like either I'm going to buy the damn thing when it comes right out.

262
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm not going to buy it.

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Or I'm going to wait for them to do a price reduction because now they've shown that they're willing to do that later.

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I bought a bunch of tracks on Rock Band this week.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm like, what?

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Because I, well, I bought a bunch of the older stuff because I wanted some other...

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I left it in my work now, and we have it all set up there so we can play at any time.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm actually buying the official, like, well someone made them their official drum silencer thing so the drums aren't so loud.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I tried making my own out of mouse pads.

270
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The funny thing about mouse pads is they soak up super glue pretty easy so it doesn't stick very well.

271
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So, I'm ripping those off and then trying these official ones out.

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Because while they stuck, they were working pretty good, but it's just, you know, after you hit them about 20 times, they fell right off.

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh well.

274
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Alright.

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my gaming week that I want to talk about.

276
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't think there is.

277
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I think that's really it.

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Obviously Smash Brothers took a large chunk of my time.

279
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
As I'm sure for many of you out there who own a Wii, it's taking up a lot of your time as well.

280
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I love the demos that they have for the virtual console games.

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'd laugh though because I was just, you know, they show you how long the demo is for each one.

282
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Ice Climbers, 40 seconds.

283
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's all you get to play of Ice Climbers is 40 seconds.

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But you can do a lot in 40 seconds in Ice Climbers.

285
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
40 seconds is long enough to beat the first level.

286
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I thought the demos were a nice touch.

287
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I was kind of hoping you would unlock more.

288
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't know if you do yet.

289
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I do.

290
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you?

291
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah.

292
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh, I haven't seen, because one of my friends marathoned it last night.

293
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I haven't seen if he unlocked anything else.

294
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I imagine you have to unlock a couple others.

295
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I have to look at my Japanese one too because I've got, I think, Mother 2 or Mother 3.

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Not Mother 3, but Mother 2 I think is still on there.

297
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Huh.

298
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That may be cool because that means we might have Earthbound on ours.

299
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No.

300
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Damn it.

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That was exclusive for Japan.

302
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Alright.

303
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Well then we should get something exclusive.

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's not fair.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Nintendo.

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Alright.

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's, I mean...

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Metal Gear Solid.

309
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's kind of shown though that they can't, I mean, they can do a virtual console demo.

310
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Time limited, but it works, right?

311
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, they're just assholes, that's all.

312
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Alright.

313
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Anyhow, let's see.

314
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let's get to tonight's housekeeping before we get to tonight's news.

315
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And I guess I already said the one thing I wanted to say on housekeeping tonight.

316
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We do have a friend code thread going on on the forums at orangelaunchradio.com.

317
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So we will be having some OL Army tournaments and things like that because, you know, lots of people love Smash Brothers.

318
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I know lots of our listeners are into this series.

319
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm sure tons of you have picked up the game.

320
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So check it out at orangelaunchradio.com.

321
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Click on the forums.

322
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And you can probably get 64 friend codes all on that list.

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And make sure if you are adding people on Brawl that you're also adding them on your system.

324
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Just in case we want to swap levels around.

325
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Because as far as I'm aware, I'm not sure if...

326
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You can drop them onto, you know, the SD memory cards.

327
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But I don't know if those things are linked to a certain system or not because Nintendo is an asshole.

328
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So, you know, they really don't want, you know, anything to work correctly.

329
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So, you know, in a perfect world you should be able to drop it onto an SD memory card and throw it up on the internet and people can download it and that kind of crap.

330
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But something tells me it won't work that way.

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Because they're afraid that someone is going to make a penis out of blocks or something in fucking Smash Brothers.

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
We'll save that for later this week.

333
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Alright.

334
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
DMN wants me to plug something he's doing too which is the OLR March Madness.

335
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We'll be talking more about that during the live only bonus segment tonight.

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But if you want to participate in choosing the best video game of all time, as chosen by our listeners, check out our forums as well in the STFU forum.

337
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's DMN's show and there's more information on how you can send your votes in and all that good stuff.

338
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So, are we ready to get into some gaming news?

339
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Why not?

340
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Alright, I think so.

341
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why don't you start us off, Logie?

342
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Alright, this isn't a big surprise because the same thing happened in Japan when Smash Brothers was released there.

343
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Some Wii systems are having trouble reading Smash Brothers Brawl because, first off, it's the first dual layer Wii game on the system.

344
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And there was an update, I believe, on the disc to update your system to be able to play those dual layer discs.

345
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And because of that, it takes a little bit more refined laser to see the data on the disc.

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And they're claiming that some of the Wii systems are kind of dusty and dirty, so they will not be able to play Brawl.

347
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So if you run into that problem, you're supposed to send your system in to Nintendo and they will fix the problem or clean your disc dry or something like that.

348
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Vacuum out the insides of your Wii or something?

349
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Something to that effect.

350
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you think there might be any, I mean, you're the type of, you know, you're a homebrew kind of guy, do you think there's any home remedies that someone could try that...

351
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I mean, obviously, you know, don't void your warranty or whatever.

352
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But if somebody out there happens to be getting this problem, is there anything they could try that wouldn't damage their Wii?

353
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It'd be hard because that disc drive's kind of funky. Maybe like a CD cleaner or something like that, or DVD cleaner.

354
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
How effective are those CD cleaner things?

355
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't think they're very effective. It's just basically a CD with brushes on it, I mean.

356
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
No, no, I was just thinking, does the Wii even play CDs? It doesn't, does it?

357
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
No.

358
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I don't know. I don't know why I was thinking that. I'm just kind of like, I don't think it plays CDs at all.

359
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Well, I don't know. My system wasn't dusty at all, and I mean, to be honest, there isn't really a lot of places for it to get dusty.

360
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I mean, that drive isn't really open that much, and there's just, there's, you know, kind of some sort of, like, brushes on it.

361
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah, there's little microbrushes on them.

362
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, microbrushes on it, so it does a pretty good job of keeping it clean.

363
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But, I mean, if you're maybe a chain smoker, and you're just like, take a hit off this Wii, you know, and stuff like that, I mean, maybe, maybe then your Wii's kind of fucked up.

364
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Trying to store some weed in your Wii?

365
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah, you're trying to, like, fill the Wii with smoke or something, and I don't know, maybe that will cause it to break, but...

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You bust it open and take a shot back after it.

367
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Really, there isn't a whole lot of, you know, intake. I mean, there's, like, a tiny little fan in that thing anyways, and I don't really see how there could be a lot of dust sitting on your laser, unless you're putting in discs that have been sitting out in the air and just, like, are caked with dust and you throw it in your system.

368
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Then that's your own damn fault. Either way, it's probably your own damn fault that they don't play, so...

369
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That's pretty much it. And Nintendo, of course, they don't want you trying to fix it yourself, but I don't know, they have a process, I guess, you can fill out a form on Nintendo's website for sending your system in to get it, you know, cleaned, I guess.

370
00:22:49,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I want to mention this comment in chat. It's completely random, but when you talk about smoke, I couldn't help but think about the Rock Band Stage Kit. Maybe you don't want to use too much of that around your Wii, but according to SSJ100Matt in chat, he says, Loki, apparently the Rock Band Stage Kit doesn't hook up to the Wii.

371
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Wrong, it does. See, here's why. Because it doesn't have anything to do with the 360 or the Wii itself, it just hooks up to audio cables, so in theory, you could throw it onto your stereo system and it would work just fine. That's how it's able to work with both systems.

372
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So if I want to get some of my ABBA karaoke CDs and put them on my CD player and use the Rock Band Stage Kit to do, like, an epic version of Chikikita, I could do that?

373
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yes, you can.

374
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That would be cheap.

375
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Alright, also, speaking of epic on your Wii, we love it when new channels come out for the Wii. Too bad this wasn't for us. It's for the folks in Japan. It's the Terribinotomo channel. That would be TV Friend.

376
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The TV Friend channel came out on the Wii this week. It's basically, like, imagine the TV Guide channel on American TV. That's kind of what they're getting on the Wii, hence why they say it may not come out here, because of the fact that, you know, here in America, on your cable, you already have a TV Guide channel.

377
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It is pretty cool, though.

378
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And, you know, we have TV Guide and all that stuff. And plus now with TiVo and, you know, cable's got it built in and all that stuff.

379
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The thing about this, though, that was really cool, at least from the video that I saw of it, is that you can look at multiple days, so you can see what's on, you know, a whole week. Usually some of those, you know, you have to kind of keep progressing hour by hour and kind of, you know, moving along the thing to see what's on the next day and stuff like that.

380
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This, you can, it'll be like a whole 3D thing and it'll turn it to the side and you can select different days, like, out and stuff like that.

381
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That's kind of cool. Does it have a globe I can spin?

382
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
No.

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Because that was the best part of the forecast channel and the news channel, was the spinning globe with the, you know, music. I love the music and the weather channel.

384
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But, you know, we could go to the grocery store and buy a TV Guide, too, if we wanted an alternative.

385
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We could, but that's money. And then I have to read.

386
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
This is free.

387
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm just kidding.

388
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So is the internet.

389
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So are you anti-TV friend channel? You do not want to be TV friend's friend?

390
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I don't think that it's necessary. I'm glad that they have it over there, but we don't really need it here. It'd be neat, but...

391
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Couldn't you say the same thing about the news channel, though? And the forecast channel, really?

392
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Is that, you know, you can get all that shit on the internet or you can, you know, watch the nightly news or you can, I don't know, read a newspaper.

393
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It just depends on what you use more.

394
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I guess that's true.

395
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Now, did you see the other cool thing you can do with this?

396
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What?

397
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
When you find your channel or whatever, you can actually use your Wii Remote as a universal remote with your TV.

398
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I know. I was going to get to that, but that's all right. No. Yeah, the Wii Mode is going to be like a universal remote.

399
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You can also change channels, do the volume and all that stuff. You can switch between Wii and TV inputs.

400
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But it's some type of, like, hack that you use with the sensor bar.

401
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Basically, I think what it does is it, I don't know if it causes the IR to bounce off of the sensor bar and bounce off your head or something like that.

402
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But when I say hack, it's an official Nintendo thing. It's not like, you know, people are hacking their systems to do it.

403
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's a Nintendo-endorsed hack.

404
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So that's kind of neat, though, that they're hacking their own stuff to do weird purposes.

405
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't know why. That strikes me as so amusing, but it does.

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So there you go.

407
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Also, what's kind of interesting, you can stamp programs that you're interested in and then you can share them with either other Wii users or you can send them to Wii Friends.

408
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And Nintendo calculates popularity scores based on what's been bookmarked.

409
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So, kind of interesting.

410
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I do like the fact that they are kind of trying to turn the Wii into a one-stop shop.

411
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Even though news and forecast and, you know, TV and all that is something you can get on the computer anyway,

412
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I kind of think it's a neat idea to have it, like, all right there on your TV. It's interesting.

413
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And, I mean, I know it's something that's available out there right now and other things, but it's free.

414
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So, I mean, even if you don't use it, it's at least there for you.

415
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah.

416
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Same with, like, the news channel. I don't read it at all, but, you know, if you want to, you can.

417
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's better, too, to have more stuff to fill your little blank TV screens with on your Wii.

418
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Doesn't that feel good, to fill in those screens?

419
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
No, I'm almost out of memory on my Wii system.

420
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What happens when we run out of space? Because you only get four screens to play with.

421
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm like, I'm seriously, I probably have maybe ten screens left. Really?

422
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, you have to delete stuff or, and then when you run out of space on the actual unit, you have to put stuff on SD memory cards.

423
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I bet you anything Nintendo is going to do something about the memory space this winter.

424
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
They have to for all this WiiWare stuff coming out.

425
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Right. I don't think so.

426
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
No, they're stubborn bastards. They won't do it.

427
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah, Frisbee says external hard drive channel.

428
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
External hard drive channel?

429
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Exactly. The SD card management channel, even though it's in the system.

430
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But something that can, like, just...

431
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It would not be that hard to have the Wii read off the SD card just like it does its own internal memory.

432
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Well, if you want to do something even more annoying, then you can also make this free or possibly as a service.

433
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You can make it like one of those Yahoo internet drives where you can store stuff on a web server and download it to your system that way.

434
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I know Nintendo says, hey, you can go in the shop channel any time and redownload this stuff for free.

435
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You don't have to pay for it again.

436
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But I'm like, I don't know if it's just me. I think the Wii shop channel is slow and clunky.

437
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's slow as shit.

438
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Like, I would not have to want to go in there every time.

439
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It brings me back to the days of the Super Nintendo and 20-

440
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Do it.

441
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah, it brings me back to the days of Prodigy, okay?

442
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
That's what the Wii shop channel feels like is Prodigy online.

443
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Eww, blow blow.

444
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I know.

445
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You want to know a true story about Prodigy?

446
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
What?

447
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Prodigy is where it all started for me, dude.

448
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
If I did not have Prodigy, the show would not exist.

449
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That was my first gateway drug to the internet was Prodigy.

450
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I remember Prodigy.

451
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I used to have on the forums, I actually had a Nintendo help thread and I would help kids with their video games.

452
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I was like 12 or 13 when this was all going on.

453
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
One time on Prodigy, we decided, me and my friend, there's a joke channel or something like that and you can submit jokes.

454
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So we thought it would be funny to submit really shitty jokes.

455
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And we wasted like an hour doing that and then my mom got the phone bill and it was like hundreds of dollars.

456
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,000
When they introduced Prodigy Chat, I got in big trouble because Prodigy Chat was a plus channel and my parents got like a $90 bill.

457
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Needless to say, I wasn't able to use Prodigy for a little while.

458
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Oh yes, Dark Sakura.

459
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Well, I started off on AOL but also after my first year on that, I ended up being a chat host for Cartoon Network.

460
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So I got a free account.

461
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I had an overhead account for a long, long time and then when I quit doing that, they didn't change me back for years.

462
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So I actually spent like maybe five or six years not being charged for AOL.

463
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
AOL was always kind of the devil to people on Prodigy.

464
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And if anyone wants to know who I was, I was CNW Allura for the Cartoon Network chat back in the day.

465
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Do you think someone's honestly going to listen to this and be all like, I remember her?

466
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Hey, watch. I did a whole bunch on that. So I don't care who knows it was me.

467
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Dartitsuyen Chat says, Sky, you wanted to grow up to be a Nintendo game counselor?

468
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Dude, wasn't that like all of our dreams in junior high school until we realized...

469
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
No.

470
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Kind of a fancy call center with that guy.

471
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Ever.

472
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But you could play video games for a living.

473
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah.

474
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And get paid for it.

475
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
No.

476
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Alright, let's go ahead and move on.

477
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm trying to help stupid people get through the game.

478
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
How'd I get more into the jump?

479
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Push the B button, or the A button.

480
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's not working.

481
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I bet there's...

482
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Turn on your system.

483
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It is.

484
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I bet there were some real dopes that called in. Anyway, sorry.

485
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
For more Wii news and not AOL or Prodigy, which we, you know, we called... Nevermind.

486
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I love that we are on the cutting edge of technology here on this show.

487
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Remember Prodigy?

488
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Sorry.

489
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Comp you suck.

490
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I need people who use that.

491
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Anyway, Okami Wii is actually getting a later release date than was anticipated.

492
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
They originally said March 25th that it's going to be April 15th.

493
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So, get ready to play it then.

494
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Capcom doesn't really want to tell us why.

495
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
No.

496
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Is it? Well, I mean, you know, it's not like there isn't a version of Okami already out there.

497
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So, I think a little weight won't kill anybody.

498
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'll tell you why it's not coming out on the 25th, because it's not done. I don't know.

499
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You know why games get delayed surprisingly or something? They fail the little seal of approval check and all that stuff.

500
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah, the seal of approval of anything.

501
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
No, but don't the games have to be ok?

502
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Xbox 360 games have to go through a Microsoft certification process.

503
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Nintendo games have to go through something similar. Maybe it failed.

504
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Really? You mean they actually put these shitty Destiny games through that same Nintendo seal of approval?

505
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Someone actually ok's this shit to come out?

506
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah, that's one.

507
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yes and no. I have heard of the fact that sometimes gaming companies say they don't want these games to come out on their system.

508
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I've heard of that happening.

509
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But the other thing is that for every Xbox game, you have to refer to the little X button as the guide button.

510
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Your A's have to be colored like the A button and all that stuff.

511
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Somebody actually goes through and makes sure the game is compliant.

512
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So I bet you anything with Okami, somebody missed something and a Playstation 2 character came over and they had to go back and fix it.

513
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Oh, I'm glad that they fixed those little details.

514
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I have absolutely nothing to back that up.

515
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But sometimes these are why games get unexpectedly delayed.

516
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And if they're not saying anything about it, you never know.

517
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Who cares? I mean, eh.

518
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
There's nothing coming out in April anyways. At least not in the first half.

519
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So it's the only thing.

520
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Is the top title of the first half of April now?

521
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm going over to chat at chat.orangelaundraider.com and just a completely random comment out of thin air.

522
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I guess it must have been on another topic.

523
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
gripper01 in chat says, I'm stuck on the second boss on Lost Odyssey.

524
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's hard.

525
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And Lost Odyssey does have some pretty tough bosses in it.

526
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But you know what's really funny?

527
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You'll notice in my gaming week, as much of a love fest as I was having with Lost Odyssey last week, I didn't even play it.

528
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I didn't touch it this week.

529
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
My roommate comes up to me yesterday and goes, did you stop playing Lost Odyssey?

530
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's like I wanted to see more of it.

531
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I can't remember if I played Lost Odyssey or not because I'm still fighting with that fucking 360 that does not want to work.

532
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm going to throw it away one of these days.

533
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
No, I do fully intend to go back and play more Lost Odyssey.

534
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's just I got tied up in Hello.

535
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I mean, Smash Brothers came out this week and Warcraft Addiction and all that other stuff.

536
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Some of my other online games got in the way this week too.

537
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Second boss of Lost Odyssey, I'm trying to think.

538
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, you just have to keep casting spells against it.

539
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I think it's based on fire, so water spells maybe?

540
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah, water spells.

541
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I don't remember.

542
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And then after you kill the first one, there's a second one that comes.

543
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Alright, well let's go ahead and move on with the news.

544
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
There's another channel coming soon once Mario Kart is released.

545
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
When you get your copy of Mario Kart, it will actually install a new channel called the Mario Kart Wii Channel.

546
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And it will include wonderful things, including an online leaderboard, I believe.

547
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Global Friend View allows you to see where your friends are located and their online status.

548
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Maybe you can spin that globe, Rob.

549
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Spectator Mode, as well as there's going to be some other cool stuff you can do, like being able to download ghost data.

550
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Daily Missions, kind of like the mission mode in Mario Kart DS.

551
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And, what else? Let's see.

552
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That's pretty much it.

553
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But I like the fact that you can do Spectator Mode while you're waiting for races and stuff. That's kind of neat.

554
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I think it's interesting, Nintendo's strategy here, to create a whole separate channel dedicated to one of their games.

555
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I actually think it's kind of a neat idea.

556
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You've got to hand it to Nintendo at least for this much.

557
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
As pretty rad as the Xbox 360 is with its online stuff, it doesn't have a lot like this.

558
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
With the exception of stuff like Halo 3 that has their very comprehensive website with obscenely detailed game statistics.

559
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's kind of neat to see Nintendo doing something actually integrated on the Wii.

560
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Hey, they can't do something integrated on the whole system.

561
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I don't care if each one of these games has another channel that adds on to it.

562
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's fine with me, because I'm not playing 20 games at a time.

563
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Especially the AAA titles that you know tons of people are getting.

564
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I don't know what you guys have heard about the midnight launches from around the country,

565
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
but just looking on some of the various gaming blogs, talking to one of my friends that was working at one of the stores,

566
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
it sounds like... packed.

567
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It sounds like these midnight sales are absolutely packed for Smash Brothers.

568
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Actually, Dan, of course you know my husband manages a game crazy,

569
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and he was saying that what was packed was the tournament he ran and not so much the midnight sale.

570
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So people were just going for the tournament and didn't even bother to buy the game?

571
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Pretty much.

572
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That's weird.

573
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I don't know. I think he'll pick it up eventually.

574
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
He said it really thinned out when it came time for the launch.

575
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Huh.

576
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Maybe it was past all their bedtimes. Maybe they're coming back today.

577
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Maybe. I mean, I'd just say it doesn't matter what time they do a launch, pre-order your copy. You'll get it.

578
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
True.

579
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Maybe they didn't have money at the time. Maybe they're just waiting to pick it up later on,

580
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
because it's not like it's going to be hard to find, I don't think.

581
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I hate calling it pre-ordering, because really you're just reserving.

582
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's a deposit.

583
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Ordering. Reserve your copy.

584
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Let's Have Tea says there were over 300 kids at the one I went to.

585
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
GS68 says I was at the GameStop in Santa Clara this morning and the line was going around the store.

586
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Hmm.

587
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Sounds like things are pretty packed.

588
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I would say it's definitely Nintendo's version of, you know, it's their Halo.

589
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's their, you know, big, big triple-A title that causes people to come out like this.

590
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And they've got some good stuff coming up, you know, with Mario Kart next.

591
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I mean, it's not a bad thing to follow.

592
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Alright, well anyhow, moving on with some more Wii news, and of course we'll be talking about other systems later on throughout Part A and Part B,

593
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
but we'll focus on the Wii for a little bit.

594
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I want to talk about WiiWare, and one of the new titles that's going to be coming to WiiWare is a survival horror puzzler.

595
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes, that's right, it's a survival horror puzzler, and that actually sounds kind of rad.

596
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's coming from WayForward Technologies.

597
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
They made the game Shantae, or Shantae.

598
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Shantae is like somebody's name.

599
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Shantae on Game Boy Color, and it's a game called Lit, and it's being made for WiiWare.

600
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Lit is going to be about this character Jake, and he's trapped in a high school,

601
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and there's evil creatures all around the high school, and he's trying to find his girlfriend Rachel.

602
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
This is WayForward's first original IP since Shantae.

603
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Lit is going to have horror elements, boss battles, and the developers are expecting this to be a big game.

604
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And the concept art looks kind of neat.

605
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm curious how a survival horror puzzler plays out, but those are two of my favorite genres,

606
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
so the marriage of them can't be entirely a bad thing, right Jamie?

607
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's going to have cutscenes where you walk through and you meet a zombie that says,

608
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Hey, let's puzzle to get past this door.

609
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Is that...

610
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Like in Kirby's Avalanche.

611
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Or like Puzzle Quest.

612
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's like playing Puyo Puyo.

613
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yes, as if a puzzle quest survival horror game I'm sure would be well accepted.

614
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So wait, how would Resident Evil puzzler work?

615
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Solve this puzzle or Chainsaw Man is going to come after you?

616
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's like Puzzle Pirates.

617
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Silly Rob, there's no Chainsaw Man.

618
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, there is, isn't there?

619
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah, hello?

620
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
This is like the scariest guy in the game.

621
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The guy with the chainsaw on the first stage that runs up to you and just chops your head right off.

622
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
They should totally make another puzzle fighter game and just throw in characters from Resident Evil in there,

623
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and you can have Chainsaw Man all chibi style.

624
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

625
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
We need Silent Hill vs. Resident Evil the fighting game.

626
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That'd be rad.

627
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Akdefta dares to say that Pac-Man is a survival horror puzzler.

628
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I mean, you do have to solve the puzzle of every maze and you are running from ghosts, right?

629
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Ba dum bum.

630
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh!

631
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That reminded me of something.

632
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
What's that?

633
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I just noticed this while we were watching Tron last week.

634
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
That you can see Pac-Man in the background of one of the levels with Sark.

635
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
End of line.

636
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Sorry, I had to mention that.

637
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh, that's fine.

638
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I always appreciate the random Tron reference.

639
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I was saying random video game reference, but still.

640
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Did anyone pick up Discs of Tron?

641
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
No.

642
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I played the demo and I was like, God damn, this game was cool, and I was seven.

643
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I know, right?

644
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And it still wasn't as cool as the other one.

645
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah.

646
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Discs of Tron was better in the movie.

647
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Although, I am still all for it.

648
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Was that you who said that on the show or Jamie?

649
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I remember.

650
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Somebody said they should make it a ride at Disneyland.

651
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Discs of Tron should be a ride at Disneyland.

652
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
That's probably Jamie.

653
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Will you fall through the floor?

654
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I think I was talking about the people who were having the Tron part.

655
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why can't they do it with the Wii?

656
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Like, you know, you could use your Wii remote like throwing a Frisbee or something.

657
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
That would be cool.

658
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I know, right?

659
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That would be awesome, which is why it will never exist.

660
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Alright, let's move on.

661
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So, Tron is coming out.

662
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
No, I'm kidding.

663
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
How do you suggest a ride for Disneyland?

664
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Does Disneyland have a suggestion box?

665
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I think you have to be an Imagineer.

666
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Who's an Imagineer at Disneyland?

667
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
We know people that work for Disney.

668
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Listen to this program.

669
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Because every time Jamie and I talk about our big Disney whoredom.

670
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Okay, so like Disney Friends of Orange Lawn's radio, you have to make this happen.

671
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
We want a Tron experience.

672
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't care if the movie is like 20 years old.

673
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's still all kinds of rad.

674
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I have a Tron shirt.

675
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Exactly.

676
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Tron is rad.

677
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The eighties are coming back.

678
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
All they'll do is they'll just like,

679
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
what the trend has been lately is updating their rides with different movies tied to them.

680
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You know, like the whole, the old submarine ride.

681
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's now like little Nemos.

682
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So, instead of soaring over California, it'll be like soaring over the light cycles or something?

683
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Not little Nemos.

684
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Finding Nemos like, or Nemos something or other.

685
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That would be all kinds of rad if they were placed somewhere.

686
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh, come on.

687
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The submarines needed an overhaul.

688
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
What they need to do, what they'll do is they'll just like convert over the teacups to, you know, the discs of Tron.

689
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You know what?

690
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The teacups are like a sacred ride to me, so I almost want to punch you for saying that,

691
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
but it actually might be kind of cool.

692
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
SSJ100Matt, in response to how to make rides at Disney in chat, says,

693
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Sky, you need a special degree in fun.

694
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
They didn't offer fun as a major in my college.

695
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm kind of disappointed.

696
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Rob says, Rob2B says, teacups of Tron.

697
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Okay, we're getting too random.

698
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Please, Jamie, give us a story.

699
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Like I said, Tron's coming out on the Nintendo DS.

700
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
No, I'm kidding.

701
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Shut up!

702
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Famitsu has said that Tron, I can't do that.

703
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Okay.

704
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Famitsu reported that Disgaea will be out on the Nintendo DS in Japan,

705
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
titled Disgaea Prince of the Demon World.

706
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
There's not much really else about it,

707
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:45,000
but it's been rumored that it's actually a port of the original Disgaea Hour of Darkness.

708
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And apparently unlockable in it is the teacups of Tron.

709
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Shut up!

710
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I guess that's kind of cool, though, Disgaea on the DS,

711
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
because now you can take it with you everywhere you go.

712
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And you can touch them.

713
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And in order to level up to 9,999 levels, which is an insane amount,

714
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
you probably would have to take it with you everywhere you go.

715
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The Japanese WeWear promo page has been launched,

716
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and they're showing off, I guess, the 11 launch titles that they're going to have for it,

717
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
including Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Young King, and The Promised Land,

718
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Star Soldier R, a remake of Star Soldier, which looks pretty awesome,

719
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
World Puzzle Mojipitan...

720
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't even know how to pronounce that.

721
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Mojipitan Wii, Pokemon Ranch, Dr. Mario's Virus Buster, which looks kind of neat.

722
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I don't know, I guess you shoot blocks or something.

723
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I don't know.

724
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Or I'm thinking it might just be a port of Dr. Mario that might be playable online.

725
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It looks like you're firing something.

726
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I don't know.

727
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But, cool.

728
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Let's see, Marubo Shikaku.

729
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I have no idea what that is.

730
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Magnetica, which was that rip-off of Zuma.

731
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Bomberman, looks like Ookiraku Ping Pong Wii.

732
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And Angel's Solitaire.

733
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Ooh, hooray, ping pong on the Wii.

734
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm so excited.

735
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
That's never been done.

736
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And Joy Sound Wii.

737
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I have no idea what that is either.

738
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Maybe a music-based game for the Wii?

739
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I don't know, it makes sense.

740
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Maybe.

741
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I don't know.

742
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But they had some screenshots of some different things.

743
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Looks like the Dr. Mario game looks pretty cool.

744
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I guess that's Star Soldier, the one that...

745
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That middle one is Star Soldier.

746
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And then the bottom one's Magnetica.

747
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Does the website have any information about...

748
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I don't know where you're going to store all this stuff?

749
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I don't know.

750
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I heard a rumor, though, that Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game was going to take

751
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
up all your memory.

752
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I don't know.

753
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It's stupid, though.

754
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's so crazy.

755
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Oh my god, that's creepy, that Pokemon game.

756
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I know.

757
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh my god.

758
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's so creepy-looking.

759
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
But, yeah, some of the other games, like, I don't know what that puzzle game is.

760
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
There's another one that kind of looks like Sudoku, but it's not.

761
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Crystal Chronicles looks good.

762
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I don't know.

763
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm pretty impressed so far.

764
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm actually sort of looking forward to Star Soldier R, but really there's only one good

765
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
thing to me that has come out of the Star Soldier franchise.

766
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Which is?

767
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Star Parodia.

768
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You and your Parodius love.

769
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
No, it's not Parodius.

770
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Oh.

771
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I thought it was related.

772
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
This is probably going to end up being a game of the week, but it was a game that was on

773
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
PC Engine, where you played either as Bomberman, or the ship from Star Soldier, or a flying

774
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
PC Engine, and the PC Engine would shoot cue cards and CDs.

775
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Interesting.

776
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Well, another game we know Jamie loves is Pac-Man Versus.

777
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,400
Pac-Man Versus was a game where you could, like, its big niche was that you could actually

778
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,000
play as the ghost.

779
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,800
Well, somebody else has kind of taken an idea like that.

780
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,380
Let's take a classic arcade game, but, like, reverse it.

781
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,200
And the classic game is Space Invaders.

782
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Rad.

783
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,600
Now, here's the thing.

784
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,000
Space Invaders Extreme is actually kind of sexy.

785
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,560
Like, I don't know if you've played it, like, I remember Loki brought on the show.

786
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,880
Space Invaders Extreme is kind of like Luminous meets Space Invaders, which is, like, really

787
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,880
cool.

788
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,740
And so now it's kind of caused a resurgence of Space Invaders, which was always really

789
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,740
popular in Japan.

790
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:42,400
I mean, Space Invaders was always way more popular in Japan, probably, than it even was

791
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
here.

792
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,800
What's interesting is that Taito is going to be making an update to the game called

793
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,700
Space Invaders Get Even.

794
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:55,560
And in this game, you will be in control of up to 300 Space Invaders, and you get to do

795
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,360
death and destruction on human people.

796
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,000
Looks like Pikmin, sort of.

797
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,240
I guess, yeah.

798
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,920
It's been compared to Pikmin and Rampage.

799
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,180
Oh, wow, they're all sprite-y.

800
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,640
No idea yet if it is an actual game, like, disc game, or if it's a WiiWare game, but

801
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,120
either way, I say yes to more Space Invaders nostalgia, because they really did a good

802
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,680
job of the extreme, and this looks kind of fun, too.

803
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,640
So I'm all for some human killing in Space Invaders.

804
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,120
It should be fun.

805
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,120
Do you approve Dark Sakura?

806
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,120
Oh, hell yeah.

807
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,120
All right.

808
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,160
Well, there's other things that I approve of.

809
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,160
What's that?

810
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,560
That's actually the UK Virtual Consoles stuff that's coming out.

811
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,320
That's awfully nice of you to approve of that when you can't download them here.

812
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
So?

813
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
We will eventually.

814
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
Yeah, I guess that's true.

815
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,200
I mean, we pretty much mirrored, you know, eventually what comes out there in here.

816
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,200
True.

817
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
And vice versa.

818
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,640
So what's coming out is Kirby 64, the Crystal Shards, which, like the title suggests, is

819
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,880
a Nintendo 64 game.

820
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:00,520
It's a thousand Wii points, or seven pounds, and it's a lot of Kirby 3D joy and running

821
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,160
around and, you know, sucking, I guess.

822
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:17,040
So also coming out is Psychosis, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, 600 Wii points.

823
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:24,480
And basically, now this game had a really cool premise, I thought, that you were entering

824
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:31,440
your own mind as a spaceship to get rid of something that's invaded your mind.

825
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
So it's sort of like R-Type.

826
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Interesting.

827
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:42,960
However, it's got this sort of surrealist pattern to it.

828
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,960
It's pretty cool.

829
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,000
Huh.

830
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,160
Are these games that you would pay money to re-download?

831
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,800
Well, Psychosis maybe.

832
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,160
Oh, and there's another one there that I'd probably get.

833
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
What's that?

834
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,360
Super Turrican, which was an SNES game.

835
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:07,840
It's 800 points for a virtual console, and it's basically just run-and-shoot stuff.

836
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,840
It's a side-scroller.

837
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,760
Wasn't that this week's release here, Loki?

838
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,000
I can't remember.

839
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,600
Actually, the lists I've got are just ones coming out this month.

840
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,380
That's all right.

841
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,200
This month, at least from Sega, we're going to get two titles from them.

842
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,120
One is Puyo Puyo 2, so that should be pretty cool.

843
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:33,560
And the other one is Powerball, which does not have anything to do with the lotto, unfortunately.

844
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,920
It's like a hybrid of rugby and football.

845
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,960
So interesting.

846
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,280
That's kind of neat, I guess.

847
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,600
Both those, I believe, were Genesis titles, so if I remember correctly, I think it's like

848
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,600
800 points.

849
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,600
Puyo Puyo 2.

850
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,480
Ravenstaufen makes a good point.

851
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,440
Super Turrican was one of the Super Nintendo games that actually supported Dolby Surround

852
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,720
. There were a handful of games that did that.

853
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,720
That's cool.

854
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,960
I want to ask you, Dark Soccer, because I know you gave a big woohoo when we heard about

855
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
Puyo Puyo 2.

856
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,200
I know the original Puyo Puyo was kind of what we know over here as Dr. Robotnik's

857
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,280
Mean Bean Machine, the Kirby game, Kirby Avalanche, right?

858
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,280
Kirby's Avalanche.

859
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,200
What makes Puyo Puyo 2 so woohoo-worthy?

860
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,840
It's Puyo Puyo.

861
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:24,280
For puzzle games, the Puyo Puyo series is my favorite of all time.

862
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,160
I could sit and play this for hours, and I can get through this more than I can get through

863
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,160
Tetris.

864
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,160
I'll put it that way.

865
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:37,000
And I was really, really addicted and good at Tetris, but Puyo Puyo is like...

866
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,040
It's just the whole, you know, not only do you have to just, you know, make lines and

867
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:51,640
get rid of stuff, but you have to use strategy to, you know, cripple your opponent, too.

868
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,040
I mean, it's the same concept you get in Puzzle Fighter, which is why I also like Puzzle Fighter

869
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,440
a whole lot.

870
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:05,960
But my very first Puyo Puyo that I played was Kirby's Avalanche, and it was just...

871
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,240
I still have my copy, my original copy, that I bought when it was new.

872
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,280
I think I do, in my big gaming archive somewhere.

873
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,880
But I mean, as far as puzzlers go, I think that was one of the big ones to really, you

874
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,800
know, make that competitive, fun edge in a puzzle game.

875
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,920
DJ Dark Knight in chat says, I wish the newer Puyo Puyo for the DS was stateside.

876
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,240
I thought we did have a DS Puyo Puyo.

877
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,400
Or is there, like, a newer version that came out in Japan?

878
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,400
I guess there must be.

879
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,240
Well, we got Puyo Pop, I think.

880
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,760
Yeah, which is okay.

881
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,800
I still actually need to go back and get Puyo Puyo Sun on Saturn, because that one's supposed

882
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,120
to be really, really good.

883
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,680
Oh, DJ Dark Knight says the newer one is on Wi-Fi.

884
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,000
That's pretty rad.

885
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That's really cool.

886
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
That is very cool.

887
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,080
Well, since we talked about virtual console releases, let's talk about some things that

888
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,720
are going to be sold in a more traditional format this week and travel around the world

889
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,080
and talk about the release dates.

890
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,760
I'll start off with Japan tonight.

891
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,200
Xbox 360 in Japan is getting Skate on March 13th from Electronic Arts.

892
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,400
Moving on to other systems in Japan, PlayStation 3 also getting Skate, but they're also getting

893
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,040
Winning Post 7 Maximum 2008.

894
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,080
I'm not actually sure what kind of sport that is.

895
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,080
Winning Post?

896
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,080
It's horse racing.

897
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,440
Yeah, I was going to say.

898
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:26,720
It's still not Derby Owners Club or Final Furlong, which will always be one of my favorite

899
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,720
arcade games.

900
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
Final Furlong is Hump A Horse.

901
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,960
I thought they had some horse racing games on the Wii in Japan.

902
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,120
I wish those were coming over here.

903
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,120
That'd be funny.

904
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,400
Well, I'm assuming that there must be six other games in this particular series, seeing

905
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,120
as they have a seven in it.

906
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:47,360
All right, well anyway, on the Nintendo Wii, also Winning Post 7 Maximum 2008, which must

907
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,960
be kind of fun on the Wii, I imagine, if the Wii controls are what I imagine they are,

908
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,320
where you actually would get to whip your horse with the remote.

909
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,320
Mush!

910
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,260
I remember when you had Politary.

911
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,260
The horse?

912
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,260
Yeah.

913
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,260
Oh, Derby Owners Club.

914
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,260
Good times.

915
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,260
I miss that game.

916
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,260
Speaking of which, I didn't even mention this during the gaming week.

917
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,680
I'm going to take a tangent real fast.

918
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,680
I don't care.

919
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,480
You know how we were going to go play DDR on, I think it was Wednesday night, right?

920
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,480
Yeah.

921
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,480
We were going to play DDR.

922
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,320
Well, and then you had to cancel because you had other things going on, but William and

923
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,760
I went down there anyway, just to check it out.

924
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,400
It's frickin' Arcade Mania on Wednesday nights.

925
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,360
Let's go on Thursdays and stuff.

926
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,360
Bleh.

927
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,360
And I think they...

928
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,880
I don't remember seeing the Derby Machine.

929
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,520
I don't know if they got rid of it.

930
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,520
No!

931
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,520
I think it might still be there.

932
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,520
I don't want to cause a panic yet.

933
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
They put it in the bathroom or something.

934
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,520
Probably.

935
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,520
Anyway, sorry.

936
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,440
What would this show be without my random tangents?

937
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
Come on.

938
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,280
Transformers the Game also coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan.

939
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,480
If you haven't heard yet, you shouldn't buy this game, because it sucks.

940
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,000
Well, here's something that they're saying does not suck, and it's actually all kinds

941
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
of cool.

942
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,760
Baroque on the Wii makes its way in Japan this week, and that is our role-playing game

943
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,440
that's going to be pretty hot.

944
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,280
A few more weeks, we're going to get that too.

945
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,680
Yeah, it is coming out here, but if you want to get an early sneak peek and you can understand

946
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,600
Japanese, you might want to import that.

947
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,600
Or if you live in Japan, check it out.

948
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,600
PlayStation 2, guess what, winning post 7, also on PlayStation 2.

949
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:17,040
Also this week on March 13th, where would we be without a Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle

950
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,040
Orchestra?

951
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,040
Woohoo!

952
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,640
Oh, it's actually just a price reduction.

953
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,640
It's not a new release.

954
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,640
My bad.

955
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,760
They should do like a new Owen Dunn-type game with Evangelion.

956
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,760
What's that?

957
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,240
I have one of the Evangelion games.

958
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,440
See, I'm so glad I'm not the only one that does tangents.

959
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,800
Yes, Jamie, you have one of the games.

960
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,800
What is it?

961
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,400
It's on Saturn, not the Steel Girlfriend, but the other one that came out.

962
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,440
And all it is, is really confusing.

963
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,320
It's like a dating sim.

964
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,160
If this one's like the others, it's like a dating sim where you play as, I guess you

965
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,960
play as Shinji and then you choose different things in battle, then really it's just, oh

966
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,960
look, it's shooting.

967
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,960
Bang.

968
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,960
Oh look, the creature falls.

969
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,960
Bang.

970
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,080
How could you think about dating now when the world is ending?

971
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,080
I don't know, we've seen End of Evangelion.

972
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,720
Alright, if I may move on with the releases, there is a new release on PlayStation 2, and

973
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,440
it even comes with a limited edition if you want to get it.

974
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,320
12 Riven, the psi criminal of Intergal, that's the name of the games coming out in Japan.

975
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,440
Let's see, check out the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, Call of Duty 4.

976
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,440
I didn't know they had to wait for this game, Contra Dual Spirits finally comes out in Japan

977
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,140
this week.

978
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:35,580
Jewel Love, Kosuru Otome wa Shiori no Joshin comes out as well.

979
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:39,320
Lots of titles this week, more stuff in the Simple DS series.

980
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,320
Yu-Gi-Oh!

981
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:48,360
Spirit Summoner gets a price reduction, and Koinu no Heya, and Kantan Tanoshi Okuyashi

982
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,720
Navi DS comes out from Koi.

983
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,800
And oh, this is kind of rad, The Legend of Kage 2, Kage Densetsu comes out.

984
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,320
I forgot that they were, I remember now hearing a story about that they were making a sequel

985
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,320
to The Legend of Kage.

986
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,200
That's kind of rad.

987
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,920
So that will be coming out on the Nintendo DS, and lastly, let me see if there's anything

988
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:14,720
of note on the PSP, oh, Dark Sakura, Parodius Portable gets a price reduction this week.

989
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,720
Woo-hoo!

990
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,720
You want to check that out?

991
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,720
Time to import.

992
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,640
Same thing with the Salamander Portable, and Twinbee Portable.

993
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,640
Woo-hoo!

994
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,640
Jamie, you need to go on a shopping spree.

995
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,640
Really time to import.

996
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,900
You need to go on a shopping spree.

997
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,720
No new games, but easy.

998
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,320
I love Twinbee and Parodius and Salamander.

999
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,200
Some accessories come out like Easy Pouch Portable and Inner Pouch Portable.

1000
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:41,320
If you ever wanted to camouflage Inner Pouch, here's your chance.

1001
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Let's move on.

1002
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,320
Please.

1003
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:51,040
We've got our UK releases on the 13th is Sam and Max episode 204, Chariots of the Dogs

1004
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,380
on PC.

1005
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,000
And the 14th, Rob's favorite, Build-a-Bear Workshop on the DS.

1006
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Oh, hooray.

1007
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
The 14th is...

1008
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,600
That is coming for Wii sometime soon, too.

1009
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,600
Yay!

1010
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:13,360
The 14th is CSI Hard Evidence, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker on DS, Fish Tycoon, Flat Out

1011
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:24,480
Head On, Jumper on Wii, Master of Illusion on DS, No More Heroes on Wii, Star Trek Conquest,

1012
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,740
which will be PS2 and Wii, The Spiderwick Chronicles on DS, and Turning Point Fall of

1013
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:33,240
Liberty on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

1014
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,400
There's another Star Trek game coming out?

1015
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,320
Please tell me it doesn't suck, like the last one that came out on 360.

1016
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,320
I still wouldn't.

1017
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,320
On 360?

1018
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,320
Yeah.

1019
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,320
There was a...

1020
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,320
What was it, Armada or whatever it was called?

1021
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
There was a game that came out.

1022
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,040
It was on the Wii and...

1023
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,280
I think it was on the Wii.

1024
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,280
The Wii and PS2.

1025
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,280
Oh, that's right.

1026
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,280
That's right.

1027
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,280
It came out around November for us.

1028
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,000
I'm waiting for the Star Trek anime, though.

1029
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,120
That's going to be fun.

1030
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,120
I hope it happens.

1031
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,120
I know it keeps changing.

1032
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,120
Anyway, sorry.

1033
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Okay.

1034
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:05,800
In the US, we're getting some good stuff this week.

1035
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,760
Of course today, Smash Brothers, if you haven't picked it up yet, or just, I don't know, maybe

1036
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:17,080
you haven't heard over the last six months that it's coming out today, it has.

1037
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,080
Later this week, though, we've got some cool stuff, including Condemned 2, Bloodshot, that's

1038
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,480
coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1039
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,400
If you're in the mood for a light gun game for the Wii, we've got House of the Dead 2

1040
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,680
and 3 Returns for a whopping $29.99.

1041
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,000
Not bad.

1042
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,560
And let's see, also Insecticide is going to be on the DS.

1043
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,520
That was supposed to be one of those adventure games, almost kind of like a LucasArts type

1044
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,480
thing from Gamecock.

1045
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:55,760
And Pro Evo 2008, that's on almost every system out there, Konami's a soccer game.

1046
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:02,480
Buzz Junior RoboJam, if you have preschoolers, they might like that.

1047
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:09,760
Nano Straight 2 on the DS, that's a good shooter game, if you like some of those Japanese-style

1048
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,760
ones.

1049
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:17,640
Wild Arms XF, a really cool game from XSeed, that's on PSP.

1050
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:26,400
There's also a collection of previously released wrestling games, WWE Smackdown vs Raw Super

1051
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:34,920
Star series, and I believe the last three games are released in that.

1052
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,760
Buzz The Hollywood Quiz, that's on PlayStation 2 as well this week.

1053
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:46,900
Also Ratchet and Clank Size Matters on PlayStation 2, and let's see, World Championship Cards

1054
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,400
on PSP.

1055
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,760
That's, I don't know, looks kind of boring.

1056
00:59:52,760 --> 01:00:01,600
You can't wait for the wireless nunchuck adapter, they've got the cord-free wireless adapter

1057
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:07,160
for your existing nunchucks, so until the actual wireless nunchuck comes out, that'll

1058
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,780
I guess have to do.

1059
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:17,900
And then, unfortunately, I have to mention this, but I believe, no actually that may

1060
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:22,880
be Monday, whatever, but coming out next week, or the week after next I should say, I had

1061
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,160
judgment, BioLith Rebellion 2 booster pack.

1062
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,560
There's cards for that.

1063
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:33,500
We need a million copies to sell, folks!

1064
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:38,480
And no, we will not be including the booster packs, I'm afraid.

1065
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,680
Aww, jerk.

1066
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,680
Never mind, don't buy it.

1067
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,720
Alright, but didn't we get to include the sales of some other game?

1068
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,640
Was it Let's Be Friends Forever?

1069
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,800
I don't remember.

1070
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,720
Was it Let's Ride Friends Forever?

1071
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,720
Maybe, I don't remember.

1072
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,160
I think it may have been Let's Ride Friends Forever, I don't know.

1073
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,840
Just gotta keep track of all these games.

1074
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,080
Alright, that are part of the bet.

1075
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,220
Well, one game definitely wasn't a part of the bet because it probably would have sold

1076
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:08,540
tons of copies and Loki would be running around in a tingle suit before we know it, is Bully.

1077
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:13,160
But some people who bought the new version of Bully on the 360 this week apparently were

1078
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,160
left pretty disappointed.

1079
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,960
Basically the game came out and it was buggy.

1080
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,520
There's audio glitches, frame rate problems, crashes.

1081
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:28,600
This game definitely did not really do very well in QA or something, or I don't know if

1082
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
they were asleep or what.

1083
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,320
Or they just said, release it, we'll fix it in a week.

1084
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,320
Well, who knows?

1085
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,320
I mean, I don't know.

1086
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,480
I don't know who's to blame for this.

1087
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,200
Maybe they were doing it on dev kits or something and something changed.

1088
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,200
I don't know.

1089
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,120
But regardless, a Rockstar Games has basically come out and made a public apology.

1090
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,440
Really just a giant, my bad.

1091
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,680
But they are going to be doing a title update via Xbox Live.

1092
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,320
They are going to release a patch sometime in the next week.

1093
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,720
No word yet if Rockstar is actually going to be offering a complete replacement program

1094
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,600
kind of like had to happen for Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii.

1095
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,120
Probably not, because they're fixing it.

1096
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,240
They can patch it on 360.

1097
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,000
The Wii doesn't really have anything built in the place where they can patch that stuff,

1098
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,960
so that's why they did the full replacements.

1099
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,520
Did you pick up Bully by chance?

1100
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,600
Do you own any version of Bully?

1101
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,200
No, I don't own Bully.

1102
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,040
I think I may try it on the Wii.

1103
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,120
I don't know, we'll see.

1104
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,080
Does the Wii have all the waggle controls and all that good stuff?

1105
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,080
It does.

1106
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,080
And I don't know.

1107
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:32,680
I'm not, I don't really have time to play it right now, that's the problem.

1108
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,960
Maybe later I'll pick it up when it drops in price some more.

1109
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,080
Boy, our chat room is full of comedians tonight.

1110
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,240
Rob with 2B says maybe Bully was a typo for Buggy.

1111
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:49,480
And Tigerclaw says the 360 has been bullied from the sounds of it.

1112
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,720
No two drink minimum here, folks.

1113
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,040
All for free in chat.

1114
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,920
Well, how about a little bit of better news?

1115
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,460
This is for people who, like me, have an iPhone.

1116
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:04,640
There are games coming out on the iPhone, finally.

1117
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:13,760
And among them is an adaptation of Spore for iPhone, and Super Monkey Ball, with updated

1118
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,880
graphics and everything, going to be on the iPhone.

1119
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,720
There's also the actual first game is going to be called Touch Fighter, which you use

1120
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,800
as a, I guess like a steering wheel.

1121
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,640
The note on here says it took two weeks to develop, so it probably isn't going to be

1122
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,360
all that great.

1123
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:42,680
And then there's also some talk about worms, possibly a port of worms and a few other things.

1124
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:49,000
And Apple's going to be making 30% of every sale, so that's going to be good news for

1125
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,800
them.

1126
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,440
I'm going to have some Monkey Ball.

1127
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,840
That sounds so wrong.

1128
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:03,960
Gold Banjo calls it Eye Spore, and oh man, we unleashed a beast, because me reading jokes

1129
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,760
in chat, just now everything's going downhill now.

1130
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,120
Son of Dad says, Eye Spore would be an eye sore.

1131
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:18,200
Oh my God, he did not say that, did he?

1132
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,200
Yes.

1133
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,200
Startezia, no.

1134
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,200
What?

1135
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,360
I can't talk to you, you don't have an iPhone.

1136
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,440
One of Extrofer's quotes, I was in one of his YouTubes.

1137
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,400
It's funny stuff, anyway, tangent, hello.

1138
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,400
That's us, the tangent cast.

1139
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:41,400
So Bungie, after hearing the story last week about a kid who sent in his Xbox 360, that

1140
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:49,600
had been signed by various members of the Bungie team and also from Rooster Teeth, the

1141
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:57,160
folks who do Red vs. Blue, having it come back completely wiped clean, Bungie has actually

1142
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:03,640
rallied together to kind of, I don't know, make up for Microsoft's mistake.

1143
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,040
And they've, I think, gone a little bit above and beyond.

1144
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:15,360
They sent him a full, I don't know, swag box, basically, with a signed Halo 3 helmet signed

1145
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:24,920
by the entire team of Bungie and just a whole bunch of other swag from Halo 3, including

1146
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:31,360
the limited edition controllers, the Tom McFarland figurines, faceplates, wall graphics, just

1147
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,480
everything.

1148
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,360
So good job, Bungie.

1149
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,840
I thought that was really cool of them, too.

1150
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:42,860
They didn't have to, it wasn't their fault, but they made good on it.

1151
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:47,020
Achievement unlocked, as successfully kissed.

1152
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,480
I don't have the little noise, sorry.

1153
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,200
You need to get on that.

1154
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,720
I know, I will work on that.

1155
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,800
Maybe for part B I will get the achievement unlock noise for you guys.

1156
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,840
One thing that is probably inevitable that's going to happen at some point is that Microsoft's

1157
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:07,080
going to want to upgrade those hard drives that are custom to come with the 3, I'm sorry,

1158
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,400
is the show boring you, Dark Soccer?

1159
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,400
No.

1160
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,400
Just let out a big old yawn.

1161
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,880
I don't know if the mic picked that up.

1162
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,880
I don't know.

1163
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,880
I needed oxygen.

1164
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,880
All right.

1165
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,880
No, that's all right.

1166
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,240
Anyhow, apparently Microsoft is going to be getting rid of the 20 gigabyte hard drive

1167
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,760
that it currently comes with the core system, but no worries, it's actually something better

1168
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,760
that's going to happen.

1169
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,800
They're going to get a 60 gigabyte system.

1170
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:32,360
So the core system is going away, and instead you're going to get a pro system.

1171
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:37,960
So that's coming from a site named Trusted Reviews, and they seem pretty sure about this

1172
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,200
new world exclusive they've got.

1173
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:46,720
And usually we don't trust no-name sites, but then again, what are we, right?

1174
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,840
Here's my thought on it.

1175
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,080
It makes sense.

1176
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,600
I guess it makes sense.

1177
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:55,120
I don't think they're going to get rid of the core system, because they still have that

1178
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,120
argument.

1179
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,120
I'm sorry.

1180
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,120
I meant premium, not core.

1181
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,120
What the hell was I thinking?

1182
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,120
Thank you, chat.

1183
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:04,400
The premium system, what they may do, because the cost of storage is obviously coming down,

1184
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:10,560
is they may just start replacing the 20s with 60s, so eventually they won't be selling the

1185
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,840
20 gig hard drive anymore.

1186
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:16,840
It'll just come with a 60 gig hard drive, probably for the same price.

1187
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,520
Or hey, maybe they'll include a price drop in that at the same time.

1188
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,200
Wouldn't that be awesome?

1189
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,840
But I doubt it.

1190
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,600
This would make a lot of sense, though, that this is just a matter of time before this

1191
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,320
comes out, so we shall see.

1192
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:40,160
Well, as far as other things to see, and this makes me happy, there is going to be, finally,

1193
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:47,840
a Doctor Who game coming out for the DS, PS2, and PC, and that makes me very, very, very

1194
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,200
happy.

1195
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,400
And I'm assuming that you'd probably play as the 10th Doctor.

1196
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,760
I mean, I would just assume, although it'd be kind of cool if you get your choice, you

1197
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:03,600
know, or if you, like, play as a Dalek and exterminate everything in your path, I think

1198
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,600
that that would be awesome.

1199
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,640
And you know, there were Doctor Who games, like, you know, back in, you know, the early

1200
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,680
80s, I think, but this just makes me happy.

1201
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,120
It would be kind of cool, though, if you could play as a Cyberman and upgrade everybody.

1202
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,280
Any details about, like, what exactly the game's going to tell?

1203
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,580
Because I seem to remember we had this announcement on the show before, but it was, like, a rumor,

1204
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,600
so I'm just kind of curious, like, did we get any bonus information, or is this just

1205
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,160
people wanting us to remember that it is coming soon?

1206
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:37,720
Eidos is bringing it out, and the quote is not too far away as far as the release date,

1207
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:41,400
so it gets the soon category.

1208
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,880
So it will be coming soon.

1209
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,400
I would say probably later than soon.

1210
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,620
Well, congratulations, DarkSakura, you have successfully worked a Doctor Who reference

1211
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,620
into our program.

1212
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:51,620
Woohoo!

1213
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,620
There you go.

1214
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:56,200
I told you I'd find the noise at some point.

1215
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,200
Good job.

1216
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,200
Good job.

1217
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,200
Now, Loki, if you...

1218
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,760
He's keeping track of our achievement points, chat room.

1219
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:12,620
Now, Loki, if you can successfully read the next story with no boo-boos, 30 gamerscore.

1220
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:18,120
So Sega made an announcement basically this week saying that they're not interested in

1221
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,720
a buyout from EA.

1222
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:27,720
So basically they had an interview with Rooters, and the Sega Sammy CEO Simon Jeffries said

1223
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,800
his company is eager to ride the industry's recent wave of consolidation.

1224
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,640
That's not an area we want to play in right now.

1225
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,560
He said we have no interest in being acquired, we are very happy with our position right

1226
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,140
now.

1227
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,160
My thought on this is, who asked you?

1228
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,160
I mean, no one's trying to buy Sega right now, so...

1229
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,560
Well, Loki, tell us what you really think.

1230
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,800
Well, we don't want to be bought out right now.

1231
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,100
That's okay, we don't want to buy you right now either, so...

1232
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,320
That's exactly what Ross Steel, UT, and chat says.

1233
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:02,160
Who the hell wants to buy Sega Sammy?

1234
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,560
That's kind of sad.

1235
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,920
I know, I know, but you know, it's just kind of like, well, we don't want to be bought

1236
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,920
out, see?

1237
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,440
It's not like they're not getting offered to be bought out, it's just like, well, even

1238
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,760
if we were offered we'd say no, so...

1239
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,000
And Ranma and chat says, leave Sega alone!

1240
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,760
They don't have to make games for you!

1241
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:36,200
I mean, if they did buy Sega, you would get the rights to the official Beijing 2008 Olympics

1242
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,200
game.

1243
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,200
Ooh, maybe.

1244
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,640
Didn't Sega make the Mario Sonic game, or did somebody else make that?

1245
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,880
Sega made the Mario Sonic game.

1246
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,720
And you know, the Mario Sonic game did pretty well.

1247
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,960
It sold 5 million worldwide.

1248
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,960
That's right.

1249
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:47,960
Man, a lot of people are suckers.

1250
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,960
I think that was one of the stories that was lost in our Part B destroyage last week, but

1251
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:52,960
you know.

1252
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:58,720
Well, you know, EA and Sega could team up, you know, possibly on The Sims 3, because

1253
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:04,320
The Sims 3, you know, has been actually announced that it is coming, and here's the thing about

1254
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:10,240
The Sims 3, here's the big twist, in The Sims 3 you will be going outside.

1255
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:16,280
Now not in real life, unfortunately, but The Sims 3 will focus a little more on outdoor

1256
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,280
life.

1257
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:22,000
It's supposed to have a more large, and like, just a gigantic neighborhood, where if you

1258
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,360
actually leave your house, you get into a much bigger area that you can kind of play

1259
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,360
with.

1260
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,920
And kill Sims.

1261
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,920
Hopefully.

1262
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,980
So, Sims mood, Sims motives, that whole thing is changing.

1263
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,720
Players are going to be encouraged to just, you know, be more social.

1264
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,600
It's going to be more of a social game, as opposed to you getting your points for, you

1265
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,240
know, remembering to eat and sleep and poop and all that stuff, so.

1266
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:51,640
Speaking of which, there will be no more P meter in The Sims.

1267
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,560
They are getting rid of that in The Sims 3.

1268
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,900
Here's a quote from the latest issue of Games for Windows magazine, quote, the biggest change

1269
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,620
to The Sims 3 is that it takes place in a wide open, constantly changing neighborhood,

1270
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:06,520
a much bigger sandbox, if you will, and a much more complex situation.

1271
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:10,640
The town and park you see on the cover image to the right exists in the same seamless space

1272
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,640
as your Sims household, and what you do outside your home now matters as much as what you

1273
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,640
do within.

1274
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,640
And somewhere in the-

1275
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,640
So you can't let yourself in front of people?

1276
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,640
Unfortunately, no.

1277
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:27,800
Dude, the best thing was to send somebody on a date and ignore their P meter?

1278
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:33,840
I think the best thing was my old roommate, Billy, did the best house ever, it was hilarious.

1279
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,120
He had seven gay guys all in a house, and you know, he had them all making out with

1280
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,880
each other or whatever, and then there was one woman that lived there.

1281
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,000
Well somewhere along the line, he forgot to build a bathroom, so the poor woman just had

1282
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:52,040
to clean up all the guys' messes, and eventually she died of fatigue, it was really sad.

1283
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:56,000
But she could never go to bed, because she always had to-

1284
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:02,560
Julie made the death house, which had like a swimming pool with no ladder, and had flammable

1285
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,000
objects, and she wouldn't teach them how to cook, but she'd make them cook.

1286
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,280
The thing is, they won't jump into the pool unless you put a ladder in.

1287
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,280
Well that's right, but you take it out.

1288
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,680
Yeah, you take it out once they're in the pool, and then they don't know how to get

1289
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,320
out of the pool without a ladder.

1290
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,000
I love it.

1291
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,880
It's like, you know, ordinary people can climb out of a pool without a ladder, but oh, the

1292
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,480
Sims just can't do it.

1293
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,480
And then you'd make like cells, you know, where you put them in the room and then you

1294
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,080
remove the door, so they're just trapped in the room.

1295
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,600
You trap them in the wall and you put a table with a radio on it, full blast, next to them.

1296
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,880
And she had like a full graveyard in the backyard.

1297
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,480
You know, I'm thinking we have issues.

1298
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,800
Like seriously, issues.

1299
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,200
I like snatching people off the street in debug mode and throwing them into my house

1300
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:53,680
and they're never to be seen ever again.

1301
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:54,680
This is so wrong!

1302
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,680
Alright.

1303
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,680
That's beautiful.

1304
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,080
I like your psychosis there.

1305
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:04,120
Dark Sakura, we really need you to bring some sanity back to the show.

1306
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,040
Dude, I was bringing the insanity.

1307
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,120
And well, I guess it's only going to continue because this is the part of the show we like

1308
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:16,120
to call Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1309
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,120
I have a game.

1310
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,840
Please say you've picked something relatively sane for the listeners tonight.

1311
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,160
Hell no!

1312
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,760
I've picked something intensely insane.

1313
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,200
I have VibRibbon as our game of the week, which is quite insane.

1314
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,960
Now, this would have nothing to do with the fact that you have kind of like brought up

1315
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,080
this game and referenced it on previous shows.

1316
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,800
I just wanted to pick it.

1317
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,800
Oh, okay.

1318
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,800
Well, you can do whatever you want.

1319
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:50,720
But we need to play the intro for everybody so they know how to play it.

1320
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:59,720
The game sings to you to tell you how to play it.

1321
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:04,200
The whole tutorial is sung to you by the stupid little rabbit and the game's all vector, which

1322
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,840
I think is pretty freaking fantastic.

1323
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:12,080
Well, not like true vector, but it's like a simple line and a line-drawing bunny that

1324
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,720
you play as.

1325
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:22,080
The game was developed by Matsuura Masaya, who was the guy who brought us Parappa and

1326
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,080
Umjiramalani.

1327
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:31,440
Basically, Vibri, who is the main character, if you do badly, well, let me start off how

1328
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,440
to play it.

1329
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,720
First of all, you've got obstacles that are in the way.

1330
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:40,360
You have a block or a loop or a wave or a pit.

1331
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:45,200
And you have to press a different button to bypass this as you're going along on basically

1332
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,160
this continuous line.

1333
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:55,960
And the way that it goes is, you know, if you don't go over the obstacles by pressing

1334
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,940
the right button, you will get hurt.

1335
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:04,120
And the more you get hurt, you change forms and you can turn from a rabbit into a frog

1336
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,800
and then a worm and then you just die.

1337
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,880
However, if you do really well, you eventually turn into a fairy princess.

1338
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:15,360
Loki, this sounds like your kind of game.

1339
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,640
You can be a fairy princess.

1340
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,680
Oh yeah, totally.

1341
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,160
Right now.

1342
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:29,480
But the other thing about this is that there are six, I believe, no, there's a few songs

1343
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:35,200
that are, yeah, six songs that are included in the game itself.

1344
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:39,400
However you can put in your own CDs and play whatever you want to, which we've tried to

1345
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:44,720
do to like a whole bunch of old Beatmania stuff, but I found the best thing ever.

1346
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,600
Let me actually play this for you guys.

1347
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,640
I know this makes horrible radio when you can't actually see the video, but I think

1348
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,940
you'll see why this is so epic when I load this here, what somebody actually did this

1349
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,280
YouTube here.

1350
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:03,120
The username on YouTube is 725Natsuko and 725Natsuko put in a very familiar song in

1351
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,400
the VIB ribbon.

1352
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:20,400
That's right, it's VIB ribbon to Dragon Force.

1353
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,400
And Dragon Force, of course, makes any game epic.

1354
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:29,400
Well, a little bit more as you go into this game, just a few more details, is that some

1355
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,320
of your other obstacles are combinations of your basic core obstacles, so you have to

1356
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,720
press the combination of the two buttons that would have been for the individual obstacle,

1357
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,480
which is where I was getting hung up.

1358
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,600
And then you have different levels of gameplay where you'll have your obstacles coming at

1359
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:52,760
you, but then as you go through harder levels, they'll cross over each other so you really

1360
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,960
don't know, you know it's coming up, but you don't know that that's the next one.

1361
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:01,040
It's like the obstacles are coming towards you at different speeds, and you can also

1362
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:05,280
play it straight forward, as in you're just staring at it across the screen, but as you

1363
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:12,480
play harder levels, you're playing at it from different angles, so it gets quite a bit harder.

1364
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:18,640
And like I said, the guy that brought this out gave us Krappa and Umjumma Lamy, but there's

1365
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,640
also sequels.

1366
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:25,280
There's Moja Ribbon, which I think I'm actually still going to pick up, but Moja Ribbon, you

1367
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:31,520
basically are, it's almost like you're rapping, but you're playing kanji.

1368
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,120
I played it once, it is fascinating.

1369
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,760
It's so different than Vib Ribbon.

1370
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,120
There's a third Vib Ribbon series.

1371
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:41,240
There's Vib Ripple that came out as well.

1372
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:49,120
Vib Ripple is supposed to be done with different images that are loaded into the game that

1373
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,120
you play with.

1374
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:59,120
Also, there is talk of making a remake of Vib Ribbon for PS3 that will be out via the

1375
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:05,520
PlayStation Network, and the quote is saying we're discussing the possibility of making

1376
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:11,320
a downloadable version of Vib Ribbon for Sony, but I don't know yet, so that would be really

1377
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,320
cool.

1378
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:17,120
And actually, this game came out in Japan and came out in Europe, but we never got it

1379
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,120
in America.

1380
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:22,920
And it was so weird to see the intro in English when I looked at this YouTube, I was like,

1381
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,400
oh yes, right, they got this game in Europe, because I've only ever played the Japanese

1382
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,400
one that you had.

1383
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,560
That's why I linked it to you so that you could see, because it has this, and it's not

1384
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,720
an exact translation, but I love Vibri.

1385
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:36,560
I love Vibri, okay, Vibri is great.

1386
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,560
Excellent stuff.

1387
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:43,440
Oh, and also when you get the high score in this game, he sings a little song to you.

1388
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,440
There should be a link up there of the song he sings when you get a high score, but it's

1389
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:52,920
just this little dance that says, yay, you got a high score, let me serenade you.

1390
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:53,920
This game is great.

1391
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,720
Look, he's a fairy princess now.

1392
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:00,400
A lovely dose of insanity courtesy of Dark Sakura from the ever-so-cracked-out, you've

1393
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,480
got to check the searches on YouTube, look at the videos, it's awesome, Vib Ribbon, that's

1394
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:09,120
V-I-B Ribbon is the name of the game, check that out.

1395
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:12,040
It's this week's Classic Game of the Week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1396
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,000
Good pick, Dark Sakura.

1397
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,280
Predictable, but good.

1398
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,280
I approve.

1399
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,280
It was a matter of time.

1400
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,800
I knew it was just a matter of time.

1401
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,080
All right, well, that's going to do it here for Orange Lounge Radio Part A, but we will

1402
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:27,640
be back in a little while with more of Orange Lounge Radio on Part B of our podcast.

1403
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,320
Yes, we are hoping we will have a Part B this week.

1404
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,680
Everything is arranged so that should happen, so stay tuned.

1405
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:38,160
Part B will be coming at you in just a few days, so we'll see you then.

1406
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,680
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1407
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,680
a week.

1408
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,920
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
