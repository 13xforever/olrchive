1
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:17,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 9th, 2008, is Smash Bros.

2
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:18,605
[SPEAKER_00]: malfunctioning on some Wii's?

3
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:22,549
[SPEAKER_00]: More car and track information is released for Gran Turismo 5.

4
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Spore gets a port to an unlikely gaming platform.

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:36,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,493
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and, wait for it, the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:44,913
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:48,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:49,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

10
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:50,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are you, Ms.

11
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:50,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Summers?

12
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:51,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaty.

13
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:52,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaty?

14
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:53,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, so meaty.

15
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:56,417
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly are you eating tonight?

16
00:00:56,817 --> 00:01:00,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm eating a protein-style cheeseburger from In-N-Out.

17
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:01,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, yum.

18
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:04,074
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't my mic.

19
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:05,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you have Loki's.

20
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:06,496
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

21
00:01:07,116 --> 00:01:07,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.

22
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:10,598
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the technical difficulties just couldn't end with last week.

23
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:10,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel better.

24
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:11,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there you go.

25
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:12,960
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel complete now?

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

27
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:17,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well let me introduce Tech Master Loki real quick and then we'll talk about last week.

28
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, now with proper mic.

29
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:21,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have the proper mic.

30
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:22,386
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, Loki?

31
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:23,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

32
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:27,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just untangling the mic on the mixing board so I don't pull it and it turns all the knobs on there.

33
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:28,939
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:53,834
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

35
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:09,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, Rebuttal Jamie, Rebuttal

36
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:41,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki gets smacked with a large trout or whatever the old MIRC thing is.

37
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:50,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, so yeah, we will release the kind of cruddy audio part B like on our Facebook and MySpace and all that stuff.

38
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:53,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to get that up tomorrow just for those folks that really want to hear it.

39
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:58,270
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, for the rest of you guys, it's just another broken show.

40
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:58,770
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we say?

41
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,612
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're hoping tonight is working.

42
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:03,453
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back to our normal selves.

43
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:04,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new month.

44
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,515
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather's getting warmer again.

45
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,452
[SPEAKER_03]: We're off to a good start because the network is actually working the way it's supposed to.

46
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:13,013
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have to jerry-rig a whole second network setup.

47
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:18,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're hoping we are ready to talk games for our full Part A and Part B tonight.

48
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:21,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will shut up and turn it over to DarkSakura who will talk about her gaming week.

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:32,205
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was almost non-existent except for, of course, Ragnarok because I've been very busy trying to get a few things ready and had a few...

50
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang-ups come in the way, but I think I'm going to actually be able to play more stuff next week.

51
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:40,197
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

52
00:03:40,257 --> 00:03:41,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes real life gets in the way of gaming.

53
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:42,358
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

54
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:44,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people can't hold the controller.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

56
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:47,541
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

57
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then, Loki, we'll go to you.

58
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:49,962
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

59
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:51,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.

60
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:58,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Orange Box on the PC because I have had it for a while and I haven't actually tried it.

61
00:03:59,888 --> 00:04:01,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks nice on the PC, but...

62
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:06,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly the same, so, you know.

63
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:15,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, oh yeah, mainly Portal, because that's actually all I got, so, which is Portal.

64
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:20,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've been playing a little bit of Smash Bros.

65
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:20,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl.

66
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:28,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like 30% way through the Subspace Emissary, so that's pretty fun.

67
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, what else?

68
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:37,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I may have played some Patapon, but that's about it.

69
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:41,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me a little bit more about Patapon, because I was reading some stuff about it, and it actually sounds like something I kind of want to play.

70
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:43,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds kind of cool.

71
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:54,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically, I mean, sort of, it's not really a rhythm music game, but you have to keep rhythm with these drums, and depending on what four-note sequence you play, they will do different things.

72
00:04:54,904 --> 00:05:00,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you have an attack sequence, you have march forward, retreat, that kind of stuff.

73
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:07,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just kind of strategize with that and keep in time at the same time.

74
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:20,120
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I did wasn't really playing games, but I got to view a lot of games, and that was we had our Eidos rep come out and talk to us a bit about the stuff that they covered during Destination PlayStation.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to see some really cool stuff, including an unreleased trailer for Tomb Raider Legends, or not Tomb Raider Legends, Tomb Raider Underworld,

76
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:32,708
[SPEAKER_02]: with gameplay footage on it, and it looks awesome.

77
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:33,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely awesome.

78
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:37,451
[SPEAKER_02]: They did some new motion capturing for everything.

79
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:38,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

80
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:44,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon my skepticism, but I have failed to get excited about Tomb Raider in about 10 years.

81
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:46,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about as awesome as Uncharted, maybe.

82
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:47,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

83
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:52,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that excited about Uncharted, but it really does look good.

84
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:57,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get excited about Tomb Raider because it's just not my thing, but it looks good.

85
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

86
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:00,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't buy it though.

87
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:03,434
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks good for people who like Tomb Raider.

88
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:03,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me.

89
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Tomb Raider.

90
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:07,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I like throwing her off a cliff and killing her and that's about it.

91
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:11,899
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure you can do that and it will look much nicer.

92
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,821
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's it.

93
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Other cool stuff I saw.

94
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:17,443
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a game.

95
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:19,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I get the title right.

96
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:22,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's called Little Ninjas.

97
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:24,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks really cool.

98
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:28,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a cross between almost like Okami and

99
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:30,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know what else.

100
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Pirates vs. Ninjas or something like that.

101
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Volleyball or dodgeball or whatever.

102
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:39,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cute little ninjas and they're fighting bad guys and stuff like that.

103
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,826
[SPEAKER_02]: All kind of cel-shaded and it looks really neat.

104
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:45,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So that will be coming out next year, unfortunately.

105
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got to see some gameplay of the new Death Junior that they're doing for the Wii.

106
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually looks pretty good.

107
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it won't suck like the rest of them.

108
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,825
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm pretty confident.

109
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:01,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the one I was kind of excited about for the... Wait, wait, I have a quick question.

110
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:02,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Death Jr.

111
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:03,167
[SPEAKER_03]: was a Konami license.

112
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:04,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is Eidos doing it now?

113
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:05,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Different publisher.

114
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:07,528
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the company-owned... Oh, gotcha.

115
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:08,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry.

116
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:09,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

117
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami just published someone else's game.

118
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

119
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

120
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder why they decided not to do this one.

121
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:15,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

122
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:19,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the last two sucked for them, and they dropped the publisher, and Eidos picked them up.

123
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:19,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

124
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:25,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I also got to see some pretty cool footage of Gauntlet for the DS.

125
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,611
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be cool.

126
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:29,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they'd put it on live.

127
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:34,674
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like a cross between the original Gauntlet and Gauntlet Legends.

128
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:42,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still top-down, like the original Gauntlet, but it's all 3D and stuff, like Legends was.

129
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:49,239
[SPEAKER_02]: The cool thing about it, though, four-player Wi-Fi co-op, and there's voice chat involved with that as well.

130
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least they're doing that right.

131
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be a pretty good purchase.

132
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:57,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to catch up on some comments from chat room because we have lots of good stuff tonight.

133
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:00,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to join us.

134
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:05,809
[SPEAKER_03]: PKJr92 says, Uncharted is way better than Tomb Raider and you can kill him.

135
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,630
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN says, Gauntlet DS equals sex.

136
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make love to it.

137
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:15,912
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, Too many gaming publications credit the publisher and not the developer.

138
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:17,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're right, and I just made the same mistake.

139
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:17,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

140
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:19,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

141
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:29,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other cool stuff I was unaware of, like the series and stuff, like Shellshock 2 they showed us, which I guess that's like a survivor horror game set in NOM.

142
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like condemned in NOM, I guess.

143
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:35,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, what other cool stuff?

144
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:40,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's this other Looney Tunes game that was a complete ripoff of Elite Beat Agents.

145
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:43,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, completely a ripoff of Elite Beat Agents.

146
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Except, I don't know about the music though.

147
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:47,599
[SPEAKER_02]: The music is like out of Looney Tunes, so it's all that orchestrated stuff.

148
00:08:48,288 --> 00:09:00,074
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Not necessarily that, but I think it did look kind of hard, but it's exactly like Elite Beat Agents.

149
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:03,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you play Elite Beat Agents, this will be easy for you.

150
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:06,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty much it.

151
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:07,118
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my game week.

152
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:17,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of exciting, though, to get to see everything, and I got to talk to her, but she offered us, well, at least me and my co-worker, to go tour Eidos, but...

153
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:20,396
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll see if I can drag other people along.

154
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:23,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't they make you sign all kinds of papers where you can't talk about it here, though?

155
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:31,104
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're just like, she was talking about, for example, showing us storyboards for Tomb Raider and stuff like that.

156
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:31,805
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

157
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:32,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

158
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,628
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this stuff is, all this stuff was pretty much announced.

159
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:39,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you know, I don't have the trailer for Tomb Raider Underworld or anything like that.

160
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:41,893
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the stuff that wasn't shown.

161
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:46,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, kind of shown behind closed doors type thing, but I don't know.

162
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:47,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty good.

163
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:47,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just

164
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:56,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Cause 2 looks exciting, but I like the first one, so looking forward to those Grand Theft Auto type of games.

165
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:59,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like there's a lot coming out for you.

166
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:01,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Good fourth quarter for them.

167
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:08,602
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good, because Eidos, in the past, it's been a rough ride.

168
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:09,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a rough ride?

169
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:09,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

170
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:10,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good.

171
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to see them getting back on track.

172
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:15,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Jamie, I got a question for you, because I know you're a fan of Elite Beat Agents, right?

173
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:15,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

174
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about the whole Looney Tunes franchise completely knocking it off?

175
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:20,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's stupid.

176
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:22,002
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's stupid?

177
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:22,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much of a good thing?

178
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a copy of a copy?

179
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:30,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that if they were going to do something, it would be better for them to do something original.

180
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:31,467
[SPEAKER_03]: But who knows?

181
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously, it can't be just a straight-up rip-off, right, Loki?

182
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:36,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to have some original stuff in it.

183
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:41,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, what it does is recreates the different cartoons, like very famous cartoon scenes or whatever.

184
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,271
[SPEAKER_02]: and so you're playing the music though with, you know, the cartoon.

185
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:46,492
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool.

186
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that might actually be kind of neat.

187
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:58,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you got like the whole thing going on there where the cartoon's going on, that's kind of, I mean, because The Leaping Ages is kind of like that in a way, but, you know, it's different.

188
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,239
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of, it controls exactly the same.

189
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:06,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you looked at the interface and how, like, the different spots where you tap and stuff, it looks exactly the same.

190
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:07,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And who knows?

191
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:09,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't looked at the developer.

192
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:10,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's the same developer.

193
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:10,964
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

194
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:15,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, GS68 in our chat room, chat.orangenlaunchradio.com, sums it up.

195
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:18,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Looney Tunes, Owen Don, do not want.

196
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:19,924
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

197
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:42,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Smash Bros Brawl

198
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:01,134
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, goddamn, I'm having a lot of fun with Super Smash.

199
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:06,117
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that I can actually understand it, as opposed to the Japanese version, like, you know, what's going on, I'm having a lot of fun.

200
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:09,479
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I do think is interesting is that whole, uh, subspace emissary mode.

201
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:15,282
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously I don't want to spoil a whole lot of what's going on, but I think what's interesting is that the cutscenes use no dialogue whatsoever.

202
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:17,703
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no dialogue whatsoever in the cutscenes.

203
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:22,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is more of an emotional reaction, you know, or it's, it's, everything is, there's no words.

204
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:24,865
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

205
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:55,649
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to do a Mario game just like this on the GameCube.

206
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:56,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course they never did.

207
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:58,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

208
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper Mario on the Wii is kind of rad.

209
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:00,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that.

210
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,210
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

211
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:05,272
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, just seeing what they did with the single player mode here and really making it a game.

212
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:07,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not like the greatest single player game ever.

213
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:12,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And you sort of have to really suspend disbelief to make the story work.

214
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:16,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they really did kind of have to put all these characters in a blender and kind of pull a story out of their butts.

215
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:17,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But it works.

216
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:22,097
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets... It does the fanboy service.

217
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:22,957
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really...

218
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,137
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what this game is all about and I'll tell you what it's it's very comprehensive fanboy service because not only do you have all these

219
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:36,039
[SPEAKER_03]: These characters, you have all the stickers, which, I mean, like, I think I got a sticker today for Mouser, one of the bosses in Super Mario 2.

220
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's some, like, obscure shit in those things.

221
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:43,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was getting things from Advance Wars I'd never even heard of, because I didn't play a lot of that series.

222
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:46,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just Nintendo fanboy wet dream, this game is.

223
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:49,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what, even if you're not, like, a Super Nintendo fanboy, it's a great party game.

224
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:54,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, duh, it's a Wii game, and the Wii has a lot of great party games, and this is no exception.

225
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was playing a little bit, three players...

226
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,641
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

227
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:25,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to point out that we have a friend code thread over on our forums.

228
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:34,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to add everybody on there later today and try to maybe bring out Justin TV this evening and try to fight some folks, Orange Launch Radio listeners.

229
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:40,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and we can use my map if I can swap it with somebody because, you know, I made a cool map.

230
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,421
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Cage Match.

231
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:43,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, nice.

232
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:44,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what you did there.

233
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:45,242
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

234
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:48,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see, what else do I want to talk about my game of the week?

235
00:14:48,949 --> 00:15:02,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quickly, I want to mention Triggerheart Excelica, because I think a lot of people, like, totally skipped this game, because it was an Xbox Live Arcade release, but I'll tell you what, if you like your Japanese shooters, this is as cliche of a Japanese shooter as they come.

236
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:03,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is...

237
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:03,683
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

238
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:34,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.

239
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever heard of this one, Trigger Heart Accelica?

240
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:36,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

241
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:38,346
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good time.

242
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:44,829
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like that, I was going to say in April there's Castle of Shikigami 3 is coming out on the Wii.

243
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,910
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be another good one.

244
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's definitely worth a look, Trigger Heart Accelica.

245
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:52,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not spend the money on the full purchase, but I might later on.

246
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:58,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm kind of at the point with Xbox 360 arcade games where either I'm going to buy the damn thing when it comes right out

247
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:04,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to buy it, or I'm going to wait for them to do a price reduction, because now they've shown that they're willing to do that later.

248
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:06,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a bunch of tracks on Rock Band this week.

249
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:07,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what?

250
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:17,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I, well, I bought a bunch of the older stuff, because I wanted some other, I left it in my work now, and we have it all set up there so we can play it anytime.

251
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:26,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually buying the official, like, well, someone made them, their official, like, drum, you know, silencer thing, so the drums aren't so

252
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:30,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried making my own out of mouse pads.

253
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:36,627
[SPEAKER_02]: The funny thing about mouse pads is they soak up super glue pretty easy, so it doesn't stick very well.

254
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:43,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm ripping those off and then trying these official ones out.

255
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:51,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Because while they stuck, they were working pretty good, but after you hit them about 20 times, they fell right off.

256
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:53,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.

257
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:57,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

258
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:03,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my gaming week that I want to talk about.

259
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:03,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there is.

260
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:04,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really it.

261
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously Smash Brothers took a large chunk of my time.

262
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:11,174
[SPEAKER_03]: As I'm sure for many of you out there who own a Wii, it's taking up a lot of your time as well.

263
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:14,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the demos that they have for the virtual console games.

264
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:19,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I laugh though because they show you how long the demo is for each one.

265
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Ice Climbers, 40 seconds.

266
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:22,952
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you get to play of Ice Climbers.

267
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,636
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do a lot in 40 seconds in Ice Climbers.

268
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:27,318
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 seconds is long enough to beat the first level.

269
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:30,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the demos were a nice touch.

270
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:32,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of hoping you would unlock more.

271
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:33,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you do yet.

272
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:33,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

273
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:34,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

274
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:35,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I haven't seen...

275
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:37,895
[SPEAKER_03]: because one of my friends marathoned it last night.

276
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen if he unlocked anything else.

277
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine you have to unlock a couple others.

278
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:46,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to look at my Japanese one, too, because I've got, I think, Mother 2 or Mother 3.

279
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:49,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Mother 3, but Mother 2, I think, is on there.

280
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:49,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

281
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:52,760
[SPEAKER_03]: That may be cool because that means we might have Earthbound on ours.

282
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,460
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

283
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

284
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,821
[SPEAKER_02]: That was exclusive for Japan.

285
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:56,281
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

286
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:58,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we should get something exclusive.

287
00:17:58,462 --> 00:17:59,442
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not fair.

288
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:01,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

289
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:01,843
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

290
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:03,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid!

291
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of shown, though, that they can do a virtual console demo.

292
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Time limited, but it works, right?

293
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:12,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're just assholes, that's all.

294
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's see.

295
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:21,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to tonight's housekeeping before we get to tonight's news.

296
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:24,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I already said the one thing I wanted to say on housekeeping tonight.

297
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:29,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a friend code thread going on on the forums at orangelaunchradio.com.

298
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:34,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be having some OL Army tournaments and things like that because lots of people love Smash Brothers.

299
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I know lots of our listeners are into this series.

300
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:38,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure tons of you have picked up the game.

301
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out at orangelaunchradio.com.

302
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:40,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on the forums.

303
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:44,125
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can probably get 64 friend codes on that list.

304
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:50,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure if you are adding people on Brawl that you're also adding them on your system in case we want to swap levels around.

305
00:18:50,668 --> 00:19:07,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as far as I'm aware, I'm not sure if you can drop them onto the SD memory cards, but I don't know if those things are linked to a certain system or not because Nintendo is an asshole, so they really don't want anything to work correctly, so

306
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:08,790
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

307
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:31,785
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN wants me to plug something he's doing too, which is the OLR March Madness.

308
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:35,227
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking more about that during the live-only bonus segment tonight.

309
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:43,692
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to participate in choosing the best video game of all time, as chosen by our listeners, check out our forums as well in the STFU forum.

310
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:47,754
[SPEAKER_03]: That's DMN's show, and there's more information on how you can send your votes in and all that good stuff.

311
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:50,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we ready to get into some gaming news?

312
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:51,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

313
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:52,897
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I think so.

314
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you start us off, Loki?

315
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:58,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this isn't a big surprise, because the same thing happened in Japan when Smash Bros.

316
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,531
[SPEAKER_02]: was released there.

317
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:03,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Wii systems are having trouble reading Smash Bros.

318
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:22,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl, because, first off, it's the first dual-layer disc for, or dual-layer Wii game on the system, and there was an update, I believe, on the disc to update your system to be able to play those dual-layer discs, and because of that, you know, it takes a little bit more, I guess...

319
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:34,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Refine Laser to see the data on the disc and they're claiming that some of the Wii systems are kind of dusty and dirty so they will not be able to play Brawl.

320
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:43,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you run into that problem you're supposed to send your system in to Nintendo and they will fix the problem or clean your disc.

321
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:44,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive or something like that.

322
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:47,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Vacuum out the insides of your Wii or something.

323
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:48,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to that effect.

324
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:52,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there might be any... I mean, you're the type of... You're a homebrew kind of guy.

325
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:56,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there's any home remedies that someone could try that... Now, obviously, you know...

326
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:58,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't void your warranty or whatever.

327
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:03,376
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody out there happens to be getting this problem, is there anything they could try that wouldn't damage their Wii?

328
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be hard because that disk drive is kind of funky.

329
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a CD cleaner or something like that.

330
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a DVD cleaner.

331
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,019
[SPEAKER_03]: How effective are those CD cleaner things?

332
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just basically a CD with brushes on it.

333
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:17,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I was just thinking?

334
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:19,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the Wii even play CDs?

335
00:21:19,422 --> 00:21:20,142
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't, does it?

336
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:21,063
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

337
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:23,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I was thinking that.

338
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:24,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of like, I don't think it

339
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:27,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

340
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:30,366
[SPEAKER_02]: My system wasn't dusty at all.

341
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:35,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, to be honest, there isn't really a lot of places for it to get dusty.

342
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that drive isn't really open that much.

343
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:38,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just there's, you know, kind of.

344
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,866
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

345
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:06,114
[SPEAKER_01]: You bust it open and take a shot back after it.

346
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, there isn't a whole lot of intake.

347
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:23,108
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a tiny little fan in that thing anyways, and I don't really see how there could be a lot of dust sitting on your laser unless you're putting in discs that have been sitting out in the air and just like are caked with dust and you throw it in your system.

348
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:24,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that's your own damn fault.

349
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:29,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, it's probably your own damn fault that they don't play, so that's...

350
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:32,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to mention this comment in chat.

351
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:38,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely random, but when you talk about smoke, I couldn't help but think about the Rock Band Stage Kit.

352
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:58,085
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

353
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:23,147
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it's able to work with both systems.

354
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:30,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I want to get some of my ABBA karaoke CDs and put them on my CD player and use the Rock Band Stage Kit to do like an epic version of Chiquiquita, I could do that?

355
00:23:31,052 --> 00:23:31,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.

356
00:23:31,753 --> 00:23:32,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

357
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:41,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, also, speaking of epic on your Wii, we love it when new channels come out for the Wii.

358
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:43,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad this wasn't for us, it's for the folks in Japan.

359
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:47,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Teribi Notomo channel, that would be TV Friend.

360
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,247
[SPEAKER_03]: The TV Friend channel came out on the Wii this week.

361
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:55,270
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically, like, imagine the TV Guide channel on American TV, that's kind of what they're getting on the Wii.

362
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:03,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Hence why they say it may not come out here, because of the fact that, you know, here in America, on your cable, you already have a TV Guide channel.

363
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:04,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pretty cool, though.

364
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:05,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we have TV Guide and all that stuff.

365
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:10,274
[SPEAKER_03]: and plus now with TiVo and cables got it built in.

366
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:18,940
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about this though that was really cool at least from the video that I saw of it is that you can look at multiple days so you can see what's on a whole week.

367
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:27,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually some of those you have to kind of keep progressing hour by hour and kind of move along the thing to see what's on the next day and stuff like that.

368
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:33,410
[SPEAKER_02]: This you can be like a whole 3D thing and it'll turn it to the side and you can select different days out and stuff like that.

369
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:33,890
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

370
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:35,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it have a globe I can spin?

371
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:37,713
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

372
00:25:00,228 --> 00:25:02,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that it's necessary.

373
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:04,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that they have it over there, but we don't really need it here.

374
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,032
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be neat, but... Couldn't you say the same thing about the news channel, though?

375
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:10,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And the forecast channel, really?

376
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:16,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that you can get all that shit on the internet, or you can watch the nightly news, or you can, I don't know, read a newspaper.

377
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:19,397
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on what you use more.

378
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:21,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

379
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the other cool thing you can do with this?

380
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:23,979
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

381
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:30,609
[SPEAKER_02]: When you find your channel or whatever, you can actually use your Wii Remote as a universal remote with your TV.

382
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to get to that, but that's alright.

383
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Wii Remote is going to be like a universal remote.

384
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:40,697
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also change channels, do the volume and all that stuff.

385
00:25:40,717 --> 00:25:42,458
[SPEAKER_03]: You can switch between Wii and TV inputs.

386
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:46,321
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's some type of hack that you use with the sensor bar.

387
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:52,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I think what it does is it... I don't know if it causes the...

388
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:54,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I.R.

389
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:57,670
[SPEAKER_02]: to bounce off of the sensor bar and bounce off your head or something like that.

390
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I say hack, it's an official Nintendo thing.

391
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:03,091
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like people are hacking their systems to do it.

392
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:04,432
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Nintendo-endorsed hack.

393
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:09,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat, though, that they're hacking their own stuff to do weird purposes.

394
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:13,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why that strikes me as so amusing, but it does.

395
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:14,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

396
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:23,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, what's kind of interesting, you can stamp programs that you're interested in, and then you can share them with either other Wii users or you can send them to Wii Friends.

397
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,381
[SPEAKER_03]: and Nintendo calculates popularity scores based on what's been bookmarked.

398
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:30,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So, kind of interesting.

399
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:40,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like the fact that they are kind of trying to turn the Wii into a one-stop shop, even though news and forecast and TV and all that is something you can get on the computer anyway.

400
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:44,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think it's a neat idea to have it all right there on your TV.

401
00:26:44,713 --> 00:26:45,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

402
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:50,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I know it's something that's available out there right now and other things, but it's free.

403
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:54,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, even if you don't use it, it's at least there for you.

404
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:56,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the news channel.

405
00:26:56,683 --> 00:27:00,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't read it at all, but if you want to, you can.

406
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:07,509
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better, too, to have more stuff to fill your little blank TV screens with on your Wii.

407
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:09,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't that feel good, to fill in those screens?

408
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,892
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm almost out of memory on my Wii system.

409
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:15,313
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens when we run out of space?

410
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:17,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you only get four screens to play with.

411
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:20,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm seriously, I probably have maybe ten screens left.

412
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:21,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

413
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:21,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

414
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:28,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you have to delete stuff, and then when you run out of space on the actual unit, you have to put stuff on SD memory cards.

415
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:31,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you anything Nintendo is going to do something about the memory space this winter.

416
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:33,686
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to for all this WiiWare stuff coming out.

417
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:34,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

418
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:35,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

419
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:37,147
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're stubborn bastards.

420
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:37,668
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't do it.

421
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:40,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Frisbee says external hard drive channel.

422
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:43,189
[SPEAKER_03]: External hard drive channel.

423
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:44,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

424
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,811
[SPEAKER_03]: The SD card management channel, even though it's in the system.

425
00:27:48,131 --> 00:27:49,291
[SPEAKER_03]: But something that can just...

426
00:27:50,217 --> 00:27:55,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It would not be that hard to have the Wii read off the SD card just like it does its own internal memory.

427
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:05,036
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

428
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:36,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's what the Wii Shop channel feels like, is Prodigy Online.

429
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, low blow.

430
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:38,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

431
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,874
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know a true story about Prodigy?

432
00:28:43,394 --> 00:28:43,674
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

433
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:45,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Prodigy's where it all started for me, dude.

434
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,298
[SPEAKER_03]: If I did not have Prodigy, this show would not exist.

435
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:51,520
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my first gateway drug to the internet, was Prodigy.

436
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Prodigy.

437
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:58,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have on the forums, I actually had a Nintendo Help thread, and I would help

438
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:00,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Prodigy Chat Prodigy Chat

439
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:25,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

440
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:25,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

441
00:29:25,183 --> 00:29:25,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

442
00:29:25,523 --> 00:29:25,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

443
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,902
[SPEAKER_03]: No, AOL was always kind of the devil to people on Prodigy.

444
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:59,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anyone wants to know who I was, I was CNW Allura for the Cartoon Network chat back in the day.

445
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:03,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think someone's honestly going to listen to this and be all like, I remember her?

446
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, watch.

447
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a whole bunch on that.

448
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:07,112
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't care.

449
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:07,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows it was me?

450
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:13,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Dartitsuya in chat says, Sky, you wanted to grow up to be a Nintendo game counselor?

451
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:18,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, wasn't that like all of our dreams in junior high school until we realized...

452
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:21,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Never have that dream.

453
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:22,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

454
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,563
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can play video games for a living.

455
00:30:27,044 --> 00:30:28,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And get paid for it.

456
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:29,865
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

457
00:30:32,147 --> 00:30:33,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go ahead.

458
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:35,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to help stupid people get through the game.

459
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:36,730
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I get more?

460
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Push the A button.

461
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:41,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not working.

462
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn on your system.

463
00:30:43,654 --> 00:30:45,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet there were some real dopes that called in.

464
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

465
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:47,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

466
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:55,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for more Wii news and not AOL or Prodigy, which we, you know, we called, um, never mind.

467
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:59,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that we are on the cutting edge of technology here on this show.

468
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:00,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, Prodigy?

469
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:03,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry?

470
00:31:04,925 --> 00:31:05,625
[SPEAKER_01]: CompuSuck.

471
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:07,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And any people who use that.

472
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:15,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Okami Wii is actually getting a later release date than was anticipated.

473
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,572
[SPEAKER_01]: They originally said March 25th, but it's going to be April 15th.

474
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:22,413
[SPEAKER_01]: So get ready to play it then.

475
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:25,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Capcom doesn't really want to tell us why.

476
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:29,777
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

477
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:32,259
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like there isn't a version of Okami already out there.

478
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:35,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a little wait won't kill anybody.

479
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you why it's not coming out on the 25th, because it's not done.

480
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:40,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

481
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:49,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, you know what, you know why games get delayed, surprisingly, they fail QA, or they fail the little seal of approval check and all that stuff.

482
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:51,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the seal of approval of anything.

483
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:59,642
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but, no, these games, don't the games have to be okay, like, Xbox 360 games have to go through, like, a Microsoft certification process, Nintendo games have to go through something similar, maybe it failed.

484
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:00,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

485
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:01,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

486
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:06,166
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean they actually put these, like, shitty Destiny games through that same, you know, Nintendo seal of approval?

487
00:32:06,286 --> 00:32:06,969
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

488
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:13,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.

489
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:19,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard of the fact that sometimes gaming companies say they don't want these games to come out on their system.

490
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:20,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of that happening.

491
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:28,492
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing is that for every Xbox game, you have to refer to the little X button as the guide button.

492
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Your A's have to be colored like the A button and all that stuff.

493
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:33,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody actually goes through and makes sure the game is compliant.

494
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:38,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bet you anything with Okami, somebody missed something and a PlayStation 2 character came over and they had to go back and fix it.

495
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:41,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm glad that they fixed those little details.

496
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:49,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I have absolutely nothing to back that up, but sometimes these are why games get unexpectedly delayed, and if they're not saying anything about it, you never know.

497
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:50,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

498
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:52,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, eh.

499
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:56,507
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing coming out in April anyways, at least not in the first half.

500
00:32:57,361 --> 00:32:58,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the only thing.

501
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:01,822
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the top title of the first half of April now.

502
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:06,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going over to chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and just a completely random comment kind of out of thin air.

503
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:08,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it must have been on another topic.

504
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:12,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Gripper01 in chat says, I'm stuck on the second boss on Lost Odyssey.

505
00:33:12,304 --> 00:33:12,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.

506
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lost Odyssey does have some pretty tough bosses in it.

507
00:33:15,904 --> 00:33:21,265
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what's really funny is like you'll notice in my gaming week, as much of a love fest as I was having with Lost Odyssey last week, I didn't even play it.

508
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:22,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't touch it this week.

509
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:26,406
[SPEAKER_03]: My roommate comes up to me yesterday and goes, did you stop playing Lost Odyssey?

510
00:33:27,392 --> 00:33:28,132
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

511
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:00,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you just have to keep casting spells against it.

512
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:03,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's based on fire, so water spells maybe?

513
00:34:04,788 --> 00:34:05,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

514
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, water spells.

515
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:07,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

516
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,435
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after you kill the first one, there's a second one that comes.

517
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:14,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, let's go ahead and move on with the news.

518
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:16,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Spectator Mode

519
00:34:45,203 --> 00:35:00,110
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as there's going to be some other cool stuff you can do like being able to download ghost data, daily missions, kind of like the mission mode in Mario Kart DS, and what else?

520
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:00,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

521
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:04,133
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

522
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:08,575
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the fact that you can do spectator mode while you're waiting for races and stuff.

523
00:35:08,595 --> 00:35:09,115
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

524
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:16,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's interesting, Nintendo's strategy here, to create a whole separate channel kind of dedicated to one of their games.

525
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:18,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think it's kind of a neat idea.

526
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:19,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

527
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:28,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you gotta hand it to Nintendo at least for this much, is that as pretty rad as the Xbox 360 is with its online stuff, it doesn't have a lot like this.

528
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: With the exception of

529
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:37,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff like Halo 3 that has their very comprehensive website with obscenely detailed game statistics.

530
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat to see Nintendo doing something actually integrated on the Wii.

531
00:35:41,503 --> 00:35:42,043
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat.

532
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:47,068
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't do something integrated on the whole system.

533
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:51,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if each one of these games has another channel that adds on to it.

534
00:35:51,718 --> 00:35:55,200
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine with me, because I'm not playing like 20 games at a time.

535
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially the AAA titles, you know, that you know tons of people are getting.

536
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:08,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what you guys have heard about the midnight launches from around the country, but just looking at some of the various gaming blogs, talking to one of my friends that was working at one of the stores, it sounds like packed.

537
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:10,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like these midnight sales are absolutely packed for Smash Bros.

538
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:23,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Dan, of course you know my husband manages a game, Crazy, and he was saying that what was packed was the tournament he ran and not so much the midnight sale.

539
00:36:24,388 --> 00:36:26,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So people were just going for the tournament and didn't even bother to buy the game?

540
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:27,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.

541
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,491
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.

542
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:30,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

543
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:32,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he'll pick it up eventually.

544
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,895
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it really thinned out when it came time for the launch.

545
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:35,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

546
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:37,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was past all their bedtimes.

547
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:38,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're coming back today.

548
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:39,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

549
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:44,286
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just say it doesn't matter what time they do a launch, pre-order your copy, you'll get it.

550
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

551
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:50,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they didn't have money at the time, maybe they're just waiting to pick it up later on, because, I mean, it's not like it's going to be hard to find, I don't think.

552
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:54,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate calling it pre-ordering, because really you're just reserving.

553
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:55,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a deposit.

554
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:56,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Ordering.

555
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:57,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, reserve your copy.

556
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's Have Tea says, there were over 300 kids at the one I went to.

557
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:06,172
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, I was at the GameStop in Santa Clara this morning and the line was going around the store.

558
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:07,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

559
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:12,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've got some good stuff coming up, you know, with Mario Kart next.

560
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not a bad thing to follow.

561
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Survival Horror Puzzler

562
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

563
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,171
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's being made for WiiWare.

564
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:08,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Lit is going to be about this character Jake and he's trapped in a high school and there's evil creatures all around the high school and he's trying to find his girlfriend Rachel.

565
00:38:09,276 --> 00:38:12,238
[SPEAKER_03]: This is WayForward's first original IP since Shantae.

566
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:19,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Lit is going to have horror elements, boss battles and the developers are expecting this to be a big game.

567
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:21,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And the concept art looks kind of neat.

568
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:31,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious how a survival horror puzzler plays out, but those are two of my favorite genres, so the marriage of them can't be entirely a bad thing, right Jamie?

569
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:36,991
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna have cutscenes where you walk through and you meet a zombie that says, hey, let's puzzle to get past this door.

570
00:38:37,011 --> 00:38:39,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in Kirby's Avalanche.

571
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:40,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like Puzzle Quest.

572
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:43,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like playing Puyo Puyo.

573
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:51,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, as if, you know, a puzzle quest survivor horror game, I'm sure would be well accepted.

574
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:54,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wait, how would, like, Resident Evil puzzler work?

575
00:38:54,347 --> 00:38:57,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, solve this puzzle, or a chainsaw man's gonna come after you?

576
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:58,950
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Puzzle Pirates.

577
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:02,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Silly Rob, there's no chainsaw.

578
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:03,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is, isn't there?

579
00:39:03,986 --> 00:39:04,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hello.

580
00:39:04,786 --> 00:39:06,206
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the scariest guy in the game.

581
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:09,627
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy with the chainsaw on the first stage that runs up to you and just chops your head right off.

582
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:17,348
[SPEAKER_02]: They should totally make another puzzle fighter game and just throw in characters from Resident Evil in there and you can have a chainsaw man, old chibi style.

583
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:20,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be awesome.

584
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:23,550
[SPEAKER_01]: We need Silent Hill vs. Resident Evil, the fighting game.

585
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,170
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be rad.

586
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:29,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft dares to say that Pac-Man is a survival horror puzzler.

587
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:34,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you do have to solve the puzzle of every maze, and you are running from ghosts, right?

588
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:37,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

589
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:40,029
[SPEAKER_01]: That reminded me of something.

590
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:40,510
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

591
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:47,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I just noticed this while we were watching Tron last week, that you can see Pac-Man in the background of one of the levels of Sark.

592
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:48,174
[SPEAKER_03]: End of line.

593
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:49,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I had to mention that.

594
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:50,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's fine.

595
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:52,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I always appreciate the random Tron reference.

596
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:54,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I just...

597
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:57,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying random video game reference, but still.

598
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:59,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anyone pick up Disks of Tron?

599
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:00,108
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

600
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:04,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the demo, and I was like, God damn, this game was cool, and I was seven.

601
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:05,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?

602
00:40:06,513 --> 00:40:08,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still wasn't as cool as the other one.

603
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:09,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

604
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:14,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Disks of Tron was better in the movie, although I am still all for it.

605
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:15,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that you who said that on the show, or Jamie?

606
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

607
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said they should make it a ride at Disneyland.

608
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Disks of Tron should be a ride at Disneyland.

609
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:20,884
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably Jamie.

610
00:40:20,904 --> 00:40:22,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you fall through the floor?

611
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:23,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never say anything like that.

612
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:26,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was talking about the people who were having the Tron part.

613
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:28,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't they do it with the Wii?

614
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:32,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you could use your Wii remote like throwing a Frisbee or something.

615
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:34,037
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

616
00:40:34,237 --> 00:40:35,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

617
00:40:35,697 --> 00:40:38,298
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome, which is why it will never exist.

618
00:40:39,998 --> 00:40:40,958
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

619
00:40:42,538 --> 00:40:43,539
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tron is coming out.

620
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:43,979
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

621
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,999
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you suggest a ride for Disneyland?

622
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Disneyland have a suggestion box?

623
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you have to be an Imagineer.

624
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:53,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's an Imagineer at Disneyland?

625
00:40:53,377 --> 00:40:58,141
[SPEAKER_03]: We know people that work for Disney and listen to this program because every time Jamie and I talk about our big Disney whoredom.

626
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:02,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so like Disney friends of Orange Lounge Radio, you have to make this happen.

627
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,405
[SPEAKER_03]: We want a Tron experience.

628
00:41:03,445 --> 00:41:05,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if the movie's like 20 years old.

629
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:06,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still all kinds of rad.

630
00:41:06,908 --> 00:41:07,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Tron shirt.

631
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:08,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

632
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Tron is rad.

633
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:12,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you have to get it in the vault.

634
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:19,238
[SPEAKER_02]: All they'll do is they'll just like, what the trend has been lately is updating their rides with different movies tied to them.

635
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:20,199
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the whole

636
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:22,980
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

637
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:58,685
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt in response to How to Make Rides at Disney in chat says, Sky, you need a special degree in fun.

638
00:41:59,826 --> 00:42:01,647
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't offer fun as a major in my college.

639
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:02,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of disappointed.

640
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:06,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob says, Rob with two B's says, Teacups of Tron.

641
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:10,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're getting too random.

642
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:11,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, Jamie, give us a story.

643
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:12,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Save us.

644
00:42:12,555 --> 00:42:14,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, Tron's coming out on the Nintendo.

645
00:42:14,556 --> 00:42:14,916
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

646
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:15,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

647
00:42:16,097 --> 00:42:20,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Famitsu has said that Tron... I can't do that.

648
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:20,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

649
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

650
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:32,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Famitsu reported that Disgaea will be out on the Nintendo DS in Japan, titled Disgaea Prince of the Demon World.

651
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:43,882
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much really else about it, but it's been rumored that it's actually a port of the original Disgaea Hour of Darkness.

652
00:42:45,703 --> 00:42:49,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently unlockable in it is, you know, the teacups of Tron.

653
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:51,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

654
00:42:54,293 --> 00:42:57,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's kind of cool though, Disgaea on the DS, because now you can take it with you everywhere you go.

655
00:42:58,236 --> 00:42:59,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can touch them.

656
00:42:59,397 --> 00:43:05,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to level up to 9,999 levels, which is an insane amount, you probably would have to take it with you everywhere you go.

657
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:12,505
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese, what, sorry, Ross Steel UT in chat made it funny.

658
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:17,769
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, in other news, Disgaea has been announced for cell phones, Xbox 360s, and teacups.

659
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:46,885
[SPEAKER_02]: The Japanese WiiWare promo page has been launched, and they're showing off, I guess, the 11 launch titles that they're going to have for it, including Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Young King, and The Promised Land, Star Soldier R, a remake of Star Soldier, which looks pretty awesome, World Puzzle Mojipitan, I don't even know how to pronounce that, Mojipitan Wii, Pokemon Ranch,

660
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mario's Virus Buster, which looks kind of neat.

661
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:51,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

662
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:54,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you shoot blocks or something.

663
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:54,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

664
00:43:54,823 --> 00:43:58,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'm thinking it might just be a port of Dr. Mario that might be playable online.

665
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:01,806
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you're firing something.

666
00:44:02,526 --> 00:44:02,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

667
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:04,387
[SPEAKER_02]: But cool.

668
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:06,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

669
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:08,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Marubo Shikaku.

670
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what that is.

671
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:14,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Magnetica, which was that ripoff of Zuma.

672
00:44:16,874 --> 00:44:17,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomberman.

673
00:44:18,943 --> 00:44:25,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Okiraku Ping Pong Wii, and Angel Solitaire.

674
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:27,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, hooray, ping pong on the Wii.

675
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:28,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited.

676
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:29,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never been done.

677
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:32,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And Joy Sound Wii.

678
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:34,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what that is either.

679
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:36,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a music-based game for the Wii?

680
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:37,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

681
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:38,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

682
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,291
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had some screenshots up of some different things.

683
00:44:44,052 --> 00:44:44,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like...

684
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mario game looks pretty cool.

685
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:51,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's Star Soldier.

686
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:53,732
[SPEAKER_02]: That middle one is Star Soldier.

687
00:44:54,132 --> 00:44:55,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the bottom one is Magnetica.

688
00:44:57,012 --> 00:45:00,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the website have any information about where you're going to store all this stuff?

689
00:45:02,054 --> 00:45:02,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

690
00:45:03,074 --> 00:45:09,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a rumor, though, that Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game was going to take up all your memory.

691
00:45:10,316 --> 00:45:10,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

692
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:11,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid, though.

693
00:45:11,396 --> 00:45:11,976
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so crazy.

694
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:14,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that's creepy.

695
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:15,873
[SPEAKER_02]: That Pokemon game.

696
00:45:16,393 --> 00:45:17,053
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

697
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:19,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so creepy looking.

698
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:23,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other games, I don't know what that puzzle game is.

699
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,075
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one that kind of looks like Sudoku, but it's not.

700
00:45:27,215 --> 00:45:28,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Crystal Chronicles looks good.

701
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:28,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

702
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:30,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty impressed so far.

703
00:45:31,476 --> 00:45:37,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually sort of looking forward to Star Soldier R, but really there's only one good thing to me that has come out of the Star Soldier franchise.

704
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:38,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is?

705
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:39,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Parodia.

706
00:45:40,959 --> 00:45:42,059
[SPEAKER_03]: You and your Parodius love.

707
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:43,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac-Man vs. Pac-Man

708
00:46:07,499 --> 00:46:12,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man Versus was a game where you could like its big niche was that you could actually play as the ghost.

709
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:15,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, somebody else is kind of taking an idea like that.

710
00:46:15,683 --> 00:46:17,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a classic arcade game, but like reverse it.

711
00:46:18,305 --> 00:46:20,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And the classic game is Space Invaders.

712
00:46:20,966 --> 00:46:21,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad.

713
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here's the thing.

714
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:25,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders Extreme is actually kind of sexy.

715
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:26,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if you've played it.

716
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:28,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I remember Loki brought on the show.

717
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders Extreme is kind of like Luminous meets Space Invaders, which is

718
00:46:31,952 --> 00:46:33,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders Get Even

719
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:57,160
[SPEAKER_03]: and in this game you will be in control of up to 300 Space Invaders and you get to do death and destruction on human people.

720
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Pikmin, sort of.

721
00:46:59,201 --> 00:47:00,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, yeah.

722
00:47:00,202 --> 00:47:02,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been compared to Pikmin and Rampage.

723
00:47:02,124 --> 00:47:03,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow, they're all sprightly.

724
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:16,315
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea yet if it is an actual game, like disc game, or if it's a WiiWare game, but either way I say yes to more Space Invaders nostalgia, because they really did a good job with Extreme, and this looks kind of fun too.

725
00:47:17,636 --> 00:47:19,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm all for a

726
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:20,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Kirby 64 The Crystal Shards

727
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:52,793
[SPEAKER_01]: which like the title suggests was a Nintendo 64 game.

728
00:47:52,813 --> 00:47:56,215
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thousand Wii points or seven pounds.

729
00:47:57,596 --> 00:48:03,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot of Kirby 3D joy and running around and, you know, sucking, I guess.

730
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:13,946
[SPEAKER_01]: So also coming out is Psychosis, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, 600 Wii points.

731
00:48:14,006 --> 00:48:14,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And

732
00:48:18,277 --> 00:48:31,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, this game had a really cool premise, I thought, that you were entering your own mind as a spaceship to get rid of something that's invaded your mind.

733
00:48:31,389 --> 00:48:32,570
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of like R-Type.

734
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:41,338
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's got this sort of surrealist pattern to it.

735
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:43,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

736
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

737
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these games that you would pay money to re-download?

738
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:51,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Psychosis, maybe.

739
00:48:51,959 --> 00:48:53,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and there's another one that I'd probably get.

740
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:54,380
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

741
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:59,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Turrigan, which was an SNES game.

742
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:07,124
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 800 points for a virtual console, and it's basically just run-and-shoot stuff.

743
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:08,524
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a side-scroller.

744
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:10,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that this week's release here, Loki?

745
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:11,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

746
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:15,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the lists I've got are just ones coming out this month.

747
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:15,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's all right.

748
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,533
[SPEAKER_02]: This month, at least from Sega, we're going to get two titles from them.

749
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:25,497
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is Puyo Puyo 2, so that should be pretty cool.

750
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:33,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one is Powerball, which does not have anything to do with the lotto, unfortunately.

751
00:49:34,684 --> 00:49:36,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a hybrid of rugby and football.

752
00:49:39,028 --> 00:49:39,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

753
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,969
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat, I guess.

754
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:45,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those, I believe, were Genesis titles, so if I remember correctly, I think like 800 Wii points?

755
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:48,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Puyo Puyo 2

756
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:18,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Puyo Puyo

757
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:51,604
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to use strategy to, you know, cripple your opponent, too.

758
00:50:51,705 --> 00:50:56,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the same concept that you get in Puzzle Fighter, which is why I also like Puzzle Fighter a whole lot.

759
00:50:57,286 --> 00:51:00,648
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I, my very first P.O.P.O.

760
00:51:00,668 --> 00:51:09,151
[SPEAKER_01]: that I played was Kirby's Avalanche, and it was just... I still have my copy, my original copy, that I bought when it was new.

761
00:51:09,331 --> 00:51:12,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I do in my big gaming archive somewhere, so...

762
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:21,502
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, as far as puzzlers go, I think that was one of the big ones to really, you know, make that competitive fun edge in a puzzle game.

763
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Dark Knight in chat says, I wish the newer Puyo Puyo for the DS was stateside.

764
00:51:25,923 --> 00:51:27,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we did have a DS Puyo Puyo.

765
00:51:28,223 --> 00:51:30,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is there like a newer version that came out in Japan?

766
00:51:30,444 --> 00:51:31,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there must be.

767
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:33,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got Puyo Pop, I think.

768
00:51:34,204 --> 00:51:36,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which is okay.

769
00:51:36,865 --> 00:51:41,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I still actually need to go back and get Puyo Puyo Sun on Saturn.

770
00:51:41,586 --> 00:51:41,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

771
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:47,106
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Dark Knight says the newer one is on Wi-Fi.

772
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:48,209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty rad.

773
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:49,472
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.

774
00:51:49,653 --> 00:51:50,255
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very cool.

775
00:51:51,196 --> 00:51:58,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since we talked about virtual console releases, let's talk about some things that are going to be sold in a more traditional format this week and travel around the world and talk about the release dates.

776
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start off with Japan tonight.

777
00:52:00,724 --> 00:52:05,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360 in Japan is getting Skate on March 13th from Electronic Arts.

778
00:52:06,068 --> 00:52:12,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to other systems in Japan, PlayStation 3 also getting Skate, but they're also getting Winning Post 7 Maximum 2008.

779
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:15,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not actually sure what kind of sport that is.

780
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:16,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning Post?

781
00:52:16,976 --> 00:52:17,576
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horse racing.

782
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:18,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say.

783
00:52:19,478 --> 00:52:19,618
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

784
00:52:20,543 --> 00:52:27,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still not Derby Owner's Club or Final Furlong, which will always be one of my favorite arcade games.

785
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Furlong is Hump a Horse.

786
00:52:29,152 --> 00:52:32,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they had some horse racing games on the Wii in Japan.

787
00:52:32,435 --> 00:52:34,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish those were coming over here.

788
00:52:34,998 --> 00:52:35,418
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be funny.

789
00:52:35,538 --> 00:52:40,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm assuming that there must be six other games in this particular series, seeing as they have a seven in it.

790
00:52:43,124 --> 00:52:49,108
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Nintendo Wii, also winning post-7 maximum 2008, which must be kind of fun on the Wii, I imagine.

791
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:54,352
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii controls are what I imagine they are, where you actually would get to whip your horse with the remote.

792
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:55,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Mush!

793
00:52:56,054 --> 00:52:57,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when you had Politary.

794
00:52:58,215 --> 00:52:58,616
[SPEAKER_03]: The horse?

795
00:52:58,836 --> 00:52:59,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

796
00:52:59,436 --> 00:53:00,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Derby Owners Club, good times.

797
00:53:01,037 --> 00:53:01,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss that game.

798
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:02,820
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

799
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:24,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Transformers The Game Nintendo Wii Japan

800
00:53:43,229 --> 00:53:47,592
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't heard yet, you shouldn't buy this game, because it sucks.

801
00:53:47,752 --> 00:53:51,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's something that they're saying does not suck, and it's actually all kinds of cool.

802
00:53:51,735 --> 00:53:58,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Baroque on the Wii makes its way in Japan this week, and that is our role-playing game that's going to be pretty hot.

803
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,061
[SPEAKER_03]: A few more weeks, we're going to get that, too.

804
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:05,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is coming out here, but if you want to get an early sneak peek and you can understand Japanese, you might want to import that.

805
00:54:05,565 --> 00:54:06,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you live in Japan, check it out.

806
00:54:07,486 --> 00:54:08,907
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2, guess what?

807
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:10,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning post 7, also on PlayStation 2.

808
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:12,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Also this week on March 13th.

809
00:54:13,556 --> 00:54:17,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would we be without a Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle Orchestra?

810
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:19,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

811
00:54:19,157 --> 00:54:20,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's actually just a price reduction.

812
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:21,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a new release.

813
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:21,858
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

814
00:54:21,998 --> 00:54:26,459
[SPEAKER_02]: They should do like a new Owen Dunn type game with Neon Genesis.

815
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:26,999
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

816
00:54:27,399 --> 00:54:29,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of the Evangelion games.

817
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,320
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm so glad I'm not the only one that does tangents.

818
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Jamie, you have one of the games.

819
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:33,141
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?

820
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:34,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of the ones on Saturn.

821
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:37,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the Steel Girlfriend, but the other one that came out.

822
00:54:38,322 --> 00:54:41,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And all it is is really confusing.

823
00:54:41,363 --> 00:54:42,363
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a dating sim.

824
00:54:43,475 --> 00:54:51,598
[SPEAKER_01]: If this one's like the others, it's like a dating sim where you play as Shinji and then you choose different things in battle.

825
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:53,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Then really it's just, oh look, it's shooting.

826
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:54,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang.

827
00:54:54,479 --> 00:54:55,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh look, the creature falls.

828
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang.

829
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,822
[SPEAKER_02]: How could you think about dating now when the world is ending?

830
00:55:01,362 --> 00:55:01,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

831
00:55:02,182 --> 00:55:03,543
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen End of Evangelion.

832
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:06,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, if I may move on with the releases.

833
00:55:06,608 --> 00:55:11,013
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a new release on PlayStation 2 and it even comes with a limited edition if you want to get it.

834
00:55:11,794 --> 00:55:13,997
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 Riven, the Psy Criminal of Integral.

835
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:15,759
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the name of the game.

836
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:16,640
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out in Japan.

837
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:20,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS.

838
00:55:21,095 --> 00:55:22,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty 4.

839
00:55:22,755 --> 00:55:24,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know they had to wait for this game.

840
00:55:24,176 --> 00:55:26,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Contra Dual Spirits finally comes out in Japan this week.

841
00:55:28,077 --> 00:55:28,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Dual Love.

842
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:34,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Kosuru Otome wa Shiori no Joshin comes out as well.

843
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of titles this week.

844
00:55:36,621 --> 00:55:38,241
[SPEAKER_03]: More stuff in the Simple DS series.

845
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:39,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Yu-Gi-Oh!

846
00:55:39,982 --> 00:55:41,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Spirit Summoner gets a price reduction.

847
00:55:42,703 --> 00:55:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Koinu no Heia.

848
00:55:45,996 --> 00:55:50,978
[SPEAKER_03]: and Kantan Tanoshi Okiyashi Navi DS comes out from Koei.

849
00:55:51,618 --> 00:55:54,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh, this is kind of rad, The Legend of Kage 2.

850
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Kage Densetsu comes out.

851
00:55:56,959 --> 00:56:00,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot that they were, I remember now hearing a story about that they were making a sequel to Legend of Kage.

852
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:01,821
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of rad.

853
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:05,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that will be coming out on the Nintendo DS.

854
00:56:05,522 --> 00:56:08,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, let me see if there's anything of note on the PSP.

855
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:11,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Dark Sakura.

856
00:56:12,277 --> 00:56:14,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Parodius Portable gets a price reduction this week.

857
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out.

858
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:19,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with Salamander Portable and Twinbee Portable.

859
00:56:20,404 --> 00:56:22,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you need to go on a shopping spree.

860
00:56:22,226 --> 00:56:23,387
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to go on a shopping spree.

861
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:28,511
[SPEAKER_01]: No new games, but... I love Twinbee and Parodius and Salamander.

862
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:34,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Some accessories come out like Easy Pouch Portable and Inner Pouch Portable.

863
00:56:34,637 --> 00:56:37,899
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever wanted to camouflage Inner Pouch, here's your chance.

864
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:39,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

865
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:41,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's move on.

866
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:43,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

867
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:45,754
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our UK releases.

868
00:56:45,894 --> 00:56:51,656
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 13th is Sam & Max episode 204, Chariots of the Dogs, on PC.

869
00:56:52,316 --> 00:56:56,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And 14th, Rob's favorite, Build-A-Bear Workshop on the DS.

870
00:56:56,577 --> 00:56:57,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hooray.

871
00:56:58,218 --> 00:57:00,679
[SPEAKER_02]: That is coming for Wii sometime soon, too.

872
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:01,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

873
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:15,151
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI Hard Evidence, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker, Fish Tycoon, FlatOutHeadOn, Jumper on Wii,

874
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:32,686

875
00:57:33,146 --> 00:57:34,587
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another Star Trek game coming out?

876
00:57:35,287 --> 00:57:35,787
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

877
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:05,034
[SPEAKER_02]: In the U.S., we're getting some good stuff this week.

878
00:58:05,794 --> 00:58:14,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, today, Smash Bros., if you haven't picked it up yet, or just, I don't know, maybe haven't heard over the last six months, that's coming out today.

879
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:15,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It has.

880
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:20,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Later this week, though, we've got some cool stuff, including Condemned 2, Bloodshot.

881
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:24,777
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

882
00:58:25,457 --> 00:58:30,338
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the mood for a light gun game for the Wii, we've got House of the Dead 2 and 3 Returns.

883
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:32,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Wappen2999 Insecticide ProEvo2008 BuzzJrRoboJam

884
00:58:58,609 --> 00:59:00,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Nanostray 2 Wild Arms XF Wrestling Games

00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:32,552
[SPEAKER_02]: WWE Smackdown vs. Raw Superstar Series Buzz, The Hollywood Quiz, Ratchet & Clank Size Matters, World Championship Cards on PSP

886
00:59:52,465 --> 01:00:02,988
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't wait for the wireless Wii nunchuck adapter, they've got the cord-free wireless adapter for your existing nunchucks.

887
01:00:03,068 --> 01:00:07,909
[SPEAKER_02]: So until the actual wireless nunchuck comes out, that'll, I guess, have to do.

888
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:18,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, unfortunately, I have to mention this, but I believe... No, actually, that may be Monday.

889
01:00:18,512 --> 01:00:21,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, but coming out next week, or the week after next, I should say,

890
01:00:22,503 --> 01:00:25,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Judgment, Biolith, Rebellion 2, Booster Pack.

891
01:00:26,024 --> 01:00:27,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice cards for that.

892
01:00:27,525 --> 01:00:29,486
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a million copies to sell, folks.

893
01:00:33,427 --> 01:00:37,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, we will not be including the Booster Packs, I'm afraid.

894
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:39,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, jerk.

895
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:43,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind, don't buy it.

896
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:45,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't we get to include the sales of some other game?

897
01:00:47,459 --> 01:00:48,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Let's Be Friends Forever?

898
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

899
01:00:49,722 --> 01:00:51,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Let's Ride Friends Forever maybe?

900
01:00:51,824 --> 01:00:52,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

901
01:00:52,405 --> 01:00:54,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it may have been Let's Ride Friends Forever.

902
01:00:54,448 --> 01:00:56,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

903
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Just got to keep track of all these games.

904
01:00:57,792 --> 01:00:58,072
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

905
01:00:58,653 --> 01:00:59,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Better part of the bet.

906
01:01:00,646 --> 01:01:08,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one game definitely wasn't a part of the bet because it probably would have sold tons of copies and Loki would be running around in a tingle suit before we know it, is Bully.

907
01:01:08,413 --> 01:01:14,119
[SPEAKER_03]: But some people who bought the new version of Bully on the 360 this week apparently were left pretty disappointed.

908
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:17,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the game came out and it was buggy.

909
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:21,686
[SPEAKER_03]: There's audio glitches, frame rate problems, crashes.

910
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:25,710
[SPEAKER_03]: This game definitely did not really...

911
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Do very well in QA or something, or I don't know if they were asleep or what.

912
01:01:29,816 --> 01:01:32,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they just said, release it, we'll fix it in a week.

913
01:01:32,557 --> 01:01:33,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, who knows?

914
01:01:33,297 --> 01:01:34,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

915
01:01:34,118 --> 01:01:35,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who's to blame for this.

916
01:01:35,298 --> 01:01:38,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they were doing it on dev kits or something and something changed.

917
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:38,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

918
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,242
[SPEAKER_03]: But regardless, Rockstar Games has basically come out and made a public apology.

919
01:01:43,902 --> 01:01:45,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically just a giant my bad.

920
01:01:45,863 --> 01:01:48,644
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are going to be doing a title update via Xbox Live.

921
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:51,165
[SPEAKER_03]: They are going to release a patch sometime in the next week.

922
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:52,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

923
01:01:53,290 --> 01:02:00,394
[SPEAKER_03]: No word yet if Rockstar is actually going to be offering a complete replacement program kind of like had to happen for Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii.

924
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:01,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not, because they're fixing it.

925
01:02:02,115 --> 01:02:03,115
[SPEAKER_02]: They can patch it on 360.

926
01:02:03,175 --> 01:02:10,679
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii doesn't really have anything built in the place where they can patch that stuff, so that's why they have to do full replacements.

927
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:14,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you pick up Bully by chance?

928
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:15,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you own any version of Bully?

929
01:02:17,142 --> 01:02:18,082
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't own Bully.

930
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I may try it on the Wii.

931
01:02:20,744 --> 01:02:21,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

932
01:02:21,164 --> 01:02:21,484
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

933
01:02:22,988 --> 01:02:26,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the Wii have all the waggle controls and all that good stuff?

934
01:02:26,071 --> 01:02:28,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, and I don't know.

935
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:30,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have time to play it right now.

936
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:31,495
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

937
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe later I'll pick it up when it drops in price some more.

938
01:02:34,937 --> 01:02:37,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, our chat room's full of comedians tonight.

939
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:40,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob with 2B says, Maybe Bully was a typo for Buggy.

940
01:02:41,202 --> 01:02:45,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tigerclaw says, The 360 has been bullied from the sounds of it.

941
01:02:49,468 --> 01:02:50,769
[SPEAKER_03]: No two-drink minimum here, folks.

942
01:02:50,989 --> 01:02:51,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Mmm.

943
01:02:51,678 --> 01:02:52,479
[SPEAKER_03]: All for free in chat.

944
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:45,466
[SPEAKER_01]: um there's also the the actual first game is going to be called Touch Fighter which you use um as a uh I guess like a steering wheel the note on here says it took two weeks to develop so it probably isn't going to be all that great um and then um there's also uh um some talk about worms possibly a port of worms and a few other things so and Apple's going to be making 30 percent of uh

945
01:03:46,181 --> 01:03:49,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Every sale, so that's going to be good news for them.

946
01:03:50,902 --> 01:03:52,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have some monkey ball.

947
01:03:54,343 --> 01:03:55,283
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds so wrong.

948
01:03:55,804 --> 01:03:57,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Gold Banjo calls it eyespore.

949
01:04:00,145 --> 01:04:06,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh man, we unleashed a beast because me reading jokes in chat, just now everything's going downhill now.

950
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:10,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of Dad says eyespore would be an eyesore.

951
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:11,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah!

952
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:17,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, he did not say that, did he?

953
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:18,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

954
01:04:18,502 --> 01:04:19,702
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkTetsuya, no.

955
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:20,643
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

956
01:04:20,763 --> 01:04:22,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't talk to you, you don't have an iPhone.

957
01:04:23,343 --> 01:04:25,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, one of Extrofer's quotes?

958
01:04:25,184 --> 01:04:26,204
[SPEAKER_03]: That was in one of his YouTubes.

959
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:28,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's funny stuff.

960
01:04:28,405 --> 01:04:30,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Tangent, hello.

961
01:04:31,186 --> 01:04:31,686
[SPEAKER_01]: That's us.

962
01:04:32,686 --> 01:04:33,646
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tangent cast.

963
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:42,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Bungie, after hearing the story last week about a kid who sent in his Xbox 360 that had been signed by

964
01:04:43,101 --> 01:04:51,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Various members of the Bungie team and also from Rooster Teeth, the folks who do Red vs. Blue.

965
01:04:52,868 --> 01:05:02,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Having it come back completely wiped clean, Bungie has actually rallied together to kind of make up for Microsoft's mistake.

966
01:05:03,515 --> 01:05:05,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've, I think, gone a little bit above and beyond.

967
01:05:06,017 --> 01:05:10,320
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent him a full, I don't know, swag...

968
01:05:10,902 --> 01:05:32,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Box, basically, with a signed Halo 3 helmet signed by the entire team of Bungie and just a whole bunch of other swag from Halo 3, including the limited edition controllers, the Tom McFarlane figurines, faceplates, wall graphics, just everything.

969
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Bungie.

970
01:05:35,437 --> 01:05:37,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was really cool of them, too.

971
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:38,679
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have to.

972
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:39,840
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't their fault, but

973
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:41,211
[SPEAKER_01]: They made good on it.

974
01:05:42,392 --> 01:05:43,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Achievement unlocked.

975
01:05:43,794 --> 01:05:44,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Ass successfully kissed.

976
01:05:57,762 --> 01:06:06,707
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that is probably inevitable, it's going to happen at some point, is that Microsoft's going to want to upgrade those hard drives that are custom to come with the three.

977
01:06:06,727 --> 01:06:08,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, is the show boring you, DarkSakura?

978
01:06:08,348 --> 01:06:08,528
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

979
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:10,149
[SPEAKER_03]: She just let out a big old yawn.

980
01:06:10,189 --> 01:06:11,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the mic picked that up.

981
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:13,831
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was, I needed oxygen.

982
01:06:15,352 --> 01:06:15,612
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

983
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:16,453
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's all right.

984
01:06:17,635 --> 01:06:25,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, apparently Microsoft is going to be getting rid of the 20GB hard drive that currently comes with the core system, but no worries, it's actually something better that's going to happen.

985
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:27,419
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to get a 60GB system.

986
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:31,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So the core system is going away, and instead you're going to get a pro system.

987
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:39,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's coming from a site named Trusted Reviews, and they seem pretty sure about this new world exclusive they've got.

988
01:06:40,044 --> 01:06:44,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, usually we don't trust no-name sites, but then again, what are we, right?

989
01:06:45,846 --> 01:06:47,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, here's my thought on it.

990
01:06:47,788 --> 01:06:48,488
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.

991
01:06:49,129 --> 01:06:50,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it makes sense.

992
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:53,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think they're gonna, um, get rid of the core system.

993
01:06:54,033 --> 01:06:56,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because they still have the... I'm sorry, I meant premium, not core.

994
01:06:56,815 --> 01:06:57,615
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell was I thinking?

995
01:06:57,655 --> 01:06:58,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, chat.

996
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:08,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the premium system, what they may do, because, you know, the cost of storage is obviously coming down, is they may just start replacing the, you know, 20s with 60s.

997
01:07:08,204 --> 01:07:11,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So, eventually, you know, they won't be selling the 20 gig hard drive anymore.

998
01:07:11,907 --> 01:07:14,849
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just come with a 60 gig hard drive, probably for the same price.

999
01:07:16,795 --> 01:07:19,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Or hey, maybe they'll include a price drop in that at the same time.

1000
01:07:19,616 --> 01:07:20,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

1001
01:07:21,096 --> 01:07:21,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But I doubt it.

1002
01:07:23,657 --> 01:07:30,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this would make a lot of sense, though, that this is just a matter of time before this comes out, so we shall see.

1003
01:07:32,139 --> 01:07:42,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as far as other things to see, and this makes me happy, there is going to be, finally, a Doctor Who game coming out for...

1004
01:07:43,607 --> 01:07:46,348
[SPEAKER_01]: The DS, PS2, and PC.

1005
01:07:46,488 --> 01:07:48,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes me very, very, very happy.

1006
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:53,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm assuming that you'd probably play as the 10th Doctor.

1007
01:07:53,892 --> 01:07:56,934
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would just assume, although it would be kind of cool if you get your choice, you know.

1008
01:07:57,894 --> 01:08:01,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you, like, play as a Dalek and exterminate everything in your path.

1009
01:08:03,377 --> 01:08:04,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that would be awesome.

1010
01:08:04,778 --> 01:08:10,761
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there were Doctor Who games, like, you know, back in, you know, the early 80s, I think.

1011
01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:11,521
[SPEAKER_01]: But

1012
01:08:12,051 --> 01:08:13,371
[SPEAKER_01]: This just makes me happy.

1013
01:08:15,172 --> 01:08:18,333
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be kind of cool, though, if you could play as a Cyberman and upgrade everybody.

1014
01:08:19,073 --> 01:08:21,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Any details about what exactly the game's going to tell?

1015
01:08:21,273 --> 01:08:24,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I seem to remember we had this announcement on the show before, but it was like a rumor.

1016
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:32,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just kind of curious, did we get any bonus information, or is this just people wanting us to remember that it is coming soon?

1017
01:08:32,296 --> 01:08:36,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Eidos is bringing it out, and the quote is not too far away as far as a release date.

1018
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:39,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets the soon category.

1019
01:08:41,337 --> 01:08:42,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will be coming soon.

1020
01:08:43,017 --> 01:08:44,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say probably later than soon.

1021
01:08:45,878 --> 01:08:47,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, congratulations, DarkSakura.

1022
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:50,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You have successfully worked a Doctor Who reference into our program.

1023
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:51,259
Woohoo!

1024
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:52,459
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1025
01:08:53,639 --> 01:08:55,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you I'd find the noise at some point.

1026
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

1027
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:57,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

1028
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,961
[SPEAKER_01]: He's keeping track of our achievement points, chat room.

1029
01:09:00,901 --> 01:09:06,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Loki, if you can successfully read the next story with no boo-boos, 30 gamerscore.

1030
01:09:10,823 --> 01:09:10,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

1031
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:20,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sega made an announcement basically this week saying that they're not interested in a buyout from EA.

1032
01:09:21,655 --> 01:09:31,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically they had an interview with Reuters and the Sega Sammy CEO Simon Jeffrey said his company is eager to ride the industry's recent wave of consolidation.

1033
01:09:32,597 --> 01:09:34,578
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not an area we want to play in right now.

1034
01:09:34,618 --> 01:09:36,718
[SPEAKER_02]: He said we have no interest in being acquired.

1035
01:09:36,778 --> 01:09:38,819
[SPEAKER_02]: We are very happy with our position right now.

1036
01:09:41,283 --> 01:09:44,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my thought on this is, who asked you?

1037
01:09:44,425 --> 01:09:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no one's trying to buy Sega right now, so Well, Loki, tell us what you really think Well, we don't want to be bought out right now That's okay, we don't want to buy you right now either, so That's exactly what Ross Steel UT in chat says Who the hell wants to buy Sega, Sammy?

1038
01:10:01,993 --> 01:10:03,034
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of sad

1039
01:10:03,712 --> 01:10:08,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, but, you know, it's just kind of like, you know, well, we don't want to be bought out.

1040
01:10:08,296 --> 01:10:12,179
[SPEAKER_02]: See, it's not like, you know, it's not like they're not getting offered to be bought out.

1041
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:15,281
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, well, even if we were offered, we'd say no, so.

1042
01:10:15,641 --> 01:10:19,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ranma in chat says, leave Sega alone!

1043
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:24,468
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to make games for you!

1044
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:32,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they did buy Sega, you would get the rights to the official...

1045
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:34,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Beijing 2008 Olympics Game

1046
01:10:53,924 --> 01:10:57,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, EA and Sega could team up, you know, possibly on The Sims 3.

1047
01:10:58,428 --> 01:11:02,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Because The Sims 3, you know, has been actually announced that it is coming.

1048
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:04,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the thing about The Sims 3.

1049
01:11:05,073 --> 01:11:05,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the big twist.

1050
01:11:05,874 --> 01:11:08,456
[SPEAKER_03]: In The Sims 3, you will be going outside.

1051
01:11:10,237 --> 01:11:12,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, not in real life, unfortunately.

1052
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:14,482
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1053
01:11:43,461 --> 01:11:45,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Sleep and Poop and all that stuff.

1054
01:11:45,184 --> 01:11:51,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So, speaking of which, there will be no more P-Meter in The Sims.

1055
01:11:51,597 --> 01:11:53,421
[SPEAKER_03]: They are getting rid of that in The Sims 3.

1056
01:11:54,404 --> 01:12:20,514
[SPEAKER_03]: here's a quote from the latest issue of Games for Windows magazine quote the biggest change to The Sims 3 is that it takes place in a wide open constantly changing neighborhood a much bigger sandbox if you will and a much more complex situation the town and park you see on the cover image to the right exists in the same seamless space as your Sims household and what you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within so you can't let yourself in front of people unfortunately no

1057
01:12:21,687 --> 01:12:24,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the best thing was to send somebody on a date and ignore their pee meter.

1058
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:32,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the best thing was my old roommate, Billy, did the best house ever.

1059
01:12:32,629 --> 01:12:33,389
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hilarious.

1060
01:12:33,789 --> 01:12:40,370
[SPEAKER_03]: He had seven gay guys all in a house, and he had them all making out with each other or whatever, and then there was one woman that lived there.

1061
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:50,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, somewhere along the line, he forgot to build a bathroom, so the poor woman just had to clean up all the guys' messes, and eventually she died of fatigue.

1062
01:12:50,112 --> 01:12:50,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really sad.

1063
01:12:51,949 --> 01:13:05,654
[SPEAKER_01]: but she could never go to bed because she always had to... Julie made the Death House which had like a swimming pool with no ladder and had flammable objects and she wouldn't teach them how to cook but she'd make them cook.

1064
01:13:06,254 --> 01:13:10,255
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is they won't jump into the pool unless you put a ladder in.

1065
01:13:10,295 --> 01:13:11,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you take it out.

1066
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:14,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you take it out once they're in the pool and then they don't know how to get out of the pool without a ladder.

1067
01:13:15,597 --> 01:13:16,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

1068
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:20,759
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, ordinary people can climb out of a pool without a ladder.

1069
01:13:21,488 --> 01:13:23,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the Sims can't do it.

1070
01:13:24,369 --> 01:13:30,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd make like cells, you know, where you put them in the room and then you lock, and then you remove the door so that they're just trapped in the room.

1071
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:35,074
[SPEAKER_02]: You trap them in the wall and you put a table with a radio on it, full blast.

1072
01:13:35,554 --> 01:13:37,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had like a full graveyard in the backyard.

1073
01:13:37,815 --> 01:13:39,736
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm thinking we have issues.

1074
01:13:40,377 --> 01:13:42,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, seriously, issues.

1075
01:13:42,838 --> 01:13:49,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I like snatching people off the street in debug mode and throwing them into my house and they're never to be seen ever again.

1076
01:13:49,961 --> 01:13:50,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Shh.

1077
01:13:52,483 --> 01:13:53,884
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week

1078
01:14:16,298 --> 01:14:17,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a game.

1079
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Please say you've picked something relatively sane for the listeners tonight.

1080
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:21,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no!

1081
01:14:22,262 --> 01:14:24,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I've picked something intensely insane.

1082
01:14:25,904 --> 01:14:30,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I have VidRibbon as our game of the week, which is quite insane.

1083
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:36,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this would have nothing to do with the fact that you have kind of like brought up this game and referenced it on previous shows.

1084
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:38,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to pick it.

1085
01:14:39,472 --> 01:14:39,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1086
01:14:39,733 --> 01:14:40,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can do whatever you want.

1087
01:14:40,553 --> 01:14:43,375
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to play the intro for everybody so they know how to play it.

1088
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,943
[SPEAKER_01]: The game sings to you to tell you how to play it.

1089
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:05,986
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole tutorial is sung to you by the stupid little rabbit, and the game's all vector, which I think is pretty freaking fantastic.

1090
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:12,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not like true vector, but it's like a simple line, and a line-drawing bunny that you play as.

1091
01:15:13,545 --> 01:15:22,749
[SPEAKER_01]: And the game was developed by Matsura Masaya, who was the guy who brought us Parappa and Jermalani.

1092
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:31,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, Vibri, who is the main character, if you do badly, well, let me start off how to play it.

1093
01:15:32,034 --> 01:15:33,634
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, you've got obstacles that are in the way.

1094
01:15:33,674 --> 01:15:36,976
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a block or a loop.

1095
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:39,272
[SPEAKER_01]: or a wave or a pit.

1096
01:15:40,192 --> 01:15:46,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to press a different button to bypass this as you're going along on basically this continuous line.

1097
01:15:49,055 --> 01:15:59,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that it goes is, you know, if you don't go over the obstacles by pressing the right button, you will get hurt.

1098
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:06,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more you get hurt, you change forms and you can turn from a rabbit into a frog and then a worm and then you just die.

1099
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:10,096
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you do really well, you eventually turn into a fairy princess.

1100
01:16:13,798 --> 01:16:15,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, this sounds like your kind of game.

1101
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:16,600
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be a fairy princess.

1102
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:17,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, totally.

1103
01:16:18,682 --> 01:16:19,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now.

1104
01:16:20,003 --> 01:16:31,111
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other things about this is that there are six, I believe, no, there's a few songs that are, yeah, six songs that are included.

1105
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,127
[SPEAKER_01]: in the game itself.

1106
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:40,959
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you can put in your own CDs and play whatever you want to, which we tried to do to like a whole bunch of old...

1107
01:16:41,832 --> 01:16:44,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Beatmania stuff, but I found the best thing ever.

1108
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:18,164
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's Bib Ribbon's Dragon Force.

1109
01:17:20,326 --> 01:17:22,447
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dragon Force, of course, makes any game epic.

1110
01:17:22,808 --> 01:17:32,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a little bit more as you go into this game, just a few more details, is that some of your other obstacles are combinations of your basic core obstacles.

1111
01:17:32,935 --> 01:17:37,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to press the combination of the two buttons that would have been for the individual obstacle, which is where I was getting hung up.

1112
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:42,302
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have different levels of gameplay where you'll have your...

1113
01:17:43,547 --> 01:17:53,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Obstacles coming at you, but then as you go through harder levels, they'll cross over each other, so you really don't know.

1114
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:55,997
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's coming up, but you don't know that that's the next one.

1115
01:17:56,017 --> 01:17:58,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So the obstacles are coming towards you at different speeds.

1116
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:08,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also play it straightforward, as in you're just staring at it across the screen, but as you play harder levels, you're playing at it from different angles.

1117
01:18:08,888 --> 01:18:11,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite a bit harder.

1118
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:11,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1119
01:18:13,263 --> 01:18:17,164
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, the guy that brought this out, Gaze, that's Krapa and M. General Lamy.

1120
01:18:17,744 --> 01:18:19,284
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also sequels.

1121
01:18:19,304 --> 01:18:24,065
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Mojibribin, which I think I'm actually still going to pick up.

1122
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:31,267
[SPEAKER_01]: But Mojibribin, you basically are... It's almost like you're rapping, but you're playing kanji.

1123
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:32,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it once.

1124
01:18:32,767 --> 01:18:33,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It is fascinating.

1125
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:35,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so different than Vibribin.

1126
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:36,788
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a third Vibribin, too.

1127
01:18:36,848 --> 01:18:37,888
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Vibripple.

1128
01:18:38,188 --> 01:18:39,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1129
01:18:39,168 --> 01:18:40,669
[SPEAKER_01]: That came out as well.

1130
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:42,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibripple is...

1131
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:49,211
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be done with different images that are loaded into the game that you play with.

1132
01:18:49,871 --> 01:19:00,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there is talk of making a remake of the ribbon for PS3 that will be out via the PlayStation Network.

1133
01:19:00,414 --> 01:19:00,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

1134
01:19:02,615 --> 01:19:09,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And the closest thing we're discussing the possibility of making a downloadable version of the ribbon for Sony, but I don't know yet.

1135
01:19:10,077 --> 01:19:11,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be really cool.

1136
01:19:11,829 --> 01:19:17,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, this game came out in Japan and came out in Europe, but we never got it in America.

1137
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:22,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so weird to see the intro in English when I looked at this YouTube.

1138
01:19:22,533 --> 01:19:26,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh yeah, that's right, they got this game in Europe, because I've only ever played the Japanese one that you had.

1139
01:19:26,055 --> 01:19:31,797
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I linked it to you so that you could see, because it has this, and it's not an exact translation, but I love the little, I love Vibri.

1140
01:19:31,817 --> 01:19:32,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Close enough, close enough.

1141
01:19:32,837 --> 01:19:34,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Vibri, okay?

1142
01:19:34,038 --> 01:19:34,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibri is great.

1143
01:19:36,499 --> 01:19:37,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent stuff.

1144
01:19:38,483 --> 01:19:41,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and also when you get the high score in this game, he sings a little song to you.

1145
01:19:43,348 --> 01:19:45,970
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be a link up there of the song he sings when you get a high score.

1146
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:50,675
[SPEAKER_01]: He does this little dance and says, Yay, you got a high score, let me serenade you.
