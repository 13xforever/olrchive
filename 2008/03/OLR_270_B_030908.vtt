00:00.000 --> 00:05.320
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, March the 9th of 2008 for this part

00:05.320 --> 00:11.160
B of our podcast, which we hope we'll actually upload to our feed this week with no problems,

00:11.160 --> 00:12.160
unlike last time.

00:12.160 --> 00:16.140
But let me not jinx things, let me shut up and let Loki get back into the gaming news

00:16.140 --> 00:17.400
this week.

00:17.400 --> 00:24.840
This week, well, of course we knew this was coming, but now, other than Steam, you can

00:24.840 --> 00:30.720
now buy the, or soon, you will be able to buy the components of the Orange box separately.

00:30.720 --> 00:37.200
You'll be hitting retail stores on April 9th, you'll be able to buy Portal for $19.99, and

00:37.200 --> 00:47.480
then of course Half-Life 2, Episode 1 and 2 for $29.99 and Team Fortress 2 for $29.99.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.880
All sold separately now, so, awesome.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.720
I don't know, Half-Life 2 I don't think was that expensive to begin with, I mean, might

00:55.720 --> 00:57.080
as well just buy them all.

00:57.080 --> 01:01.320
I think this is a really good way for people who haven't seen Portal yet to get it, because

01:01.320 --> 01:05.920
I know people that would consider that $60 for Portal was a decent buy, and you got all

01:05.920 --> 01:07.700
these other cool games free.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.000
So honestly, this is an excellent, I mean, not to knock the other games, because the

01:11.000 --> 01:14.800
Orange box is a great combo package, but certainly there's a lot of people that want to see Portal

01:14.800 --> 01:15.800
by itself.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.400
I guess if you've owned, if you already owned like Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, although if

01:19.400 --> 01:23.680
you buy the episode pack, you're getting one all over again, so, I don't know.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.240
Oh, go ahead.

01:25.240 --> 01:29.120
That whole bunch of Half-Life is just epic.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.520
It is very epic.

01:30.520 --> 01:34.280
I never realized you were quite the Half-Life fan, DarkStalker, but during our bonus segment

01:34.280 --> 01:39.040
tonight which only the live listeners heard, you're quite a Half-Life fan, I didn't realize.

01:39.040 --> 01:43.480
Well, keep in mind, I can't really play them because I get bad motion sickness when I play

01:43.480 --> 01:44.480
them.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.800
That doesn't mean you don't recognize a good game when you see one.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.720
That's right, and I, you know, I love the story for Half-Life 2, I mean, Half-Life was

01:49.720 --> 01:55.360
sort of like, oh, you crawl through some pipes and you kill some aliens, but I thought that

01:55.360 --> 02:01.640
Half-Life 2 had a very, actually a really involved story, I thought it was very good.

02:01.640 --> 02:02.640
It is very rad.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.720
I was basically loading up everything on my iPhone and listening to it on YouTube at my

02:07.720 --> 02:08.720
desk at work.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.520
RossdillUT has some advice, and I'm kind of curious if it actually would work or not.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.800
He says play on a smaller screen.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.800
Would that help?

02:14.800 --> 02:15.800
No?

02:15.800 --> 02:16.800
That's too bad.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.520
It actually has gotten a little bit better since we started playing on the widescreen.

02:19.520 --> 02:20.520
Huh.

02:20.520 --> 02:25.600
Because I have a 50-inch widescreen TV, and it was a lot worse on our old CRT, which was

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
smaller.

02:26.600 --> 02:27.600
Weird.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.800
I kind of get the logic behind what he's suggesting, though.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.400
It's kind of weird that it's the reverse.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.680
The flatter the screen, the less sick I get.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.680
Huh.

02:34.680 --> 02:40.360
And I also get less eye strain on my old Trinitron versus my old CRT screen.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.360
Yeah, the eye strain.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.720
Or my standard monitor.

02:43.720 --> 02:44.720
Interesting.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.600
But it still is bad.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.880
No matter what, it still is bad.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.480
However, nothing makes me as freaking motion sick as GoldenEye64 did.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.280
All right.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.440
Well anyhow, moving on.

02:54.440 --> 02:59.040
Speaking of splitting up, Ziff Davis Media owns a lot of stuff, and after this they might

02:59.040 --> 03:00.920
have to split some of it off.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.120
No, I'm just kidding.

03:02.120 --> 03:08.080
I'm not here yelling doom and gloom, but certainly that's what a lot of people are speculating

03:08.080 --> 03:10.800
after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.800
That's right.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.960
Ziff Davis filed for bankruptcy earlier this week.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.280
They had $390 million in debt since last August.

03:18.280 --> 03:23.000
Now, if this bankruptcy is actually approved by the bankruptcy courts, Ziff Davis is going

03:23.000 --> 03:24.360
to have to restructure some things.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.780
I don't know if that necessarily means they're going to unload some of their properties.

03:26.780 --> 03:28.680
I don't know how that actually works.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.680
I'm no legal expert.

03:29.680 --> 03:33.920
Maybe folks in chat can give us some light on that.

03:33.920 --> 03:41.560
But they're going to have to somehow basically rearrange things to pay off this $400 million.

03:41.560 --> 03:48.000
However, they are saying that all the video game stuff, it should be business as usual.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.360
Jason Young, who is the CEO of Ziff Davis, has this quote, quote, today's restructuring

03:52.360 --> 03:56.340
agreement goes a long way towards resolving the burdens of a debt load and capital structure

03:56.340 --> 04:00.440
established seven years ago during a leveraged buyout of the company.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.440
That's Chapter 11, right?

04:02.440 --> 04:03.440
Yeah.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.440
Yeah.

04:04.440 --> 04:09.840
Basically, a Chapter 11 is just strictly for businesses only, because we actually, at my

04:09.840 --> 04:14.960
work, we occasionally get a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in for multi-family homes, basically apartments,

04:14.960 --> 04:17.680
condos, that type of thing.

04:17.680 --> 04:23.360
And this is basically done for the purpose of paying back and restructuring their debt.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.960
It's to give the company a chance to make a fresh start.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
All right.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.080
Well, we'll see what happens.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.800
And of course, people are screaming doom and gloom, and our chat room is no different.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.440
P.K. Jr. 92 says, does this mean OneUp will die?

04:36.440 --> 04:37.440
No.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.440
Doubt it.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.440
I mean, it's one of their more successful properties.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.440
It's one of their more successful properties, right?

04:40.440 --> 04:43.080
Bankruptcy doesn't really kill something, so.

04:43.080 --> 04:47.440
Well, the bad thing about Chapter 11 is that it's actually really bad for their stockholders.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.440
Gotcha.

04:48.440 --> 04:54.320
Because if their debts exceed their assets, then when the bankruptcy is done, all of their

04:54.320 --> 04:57.320
rights and interests are terminated.

04:57.320 --> 05:02.400
Basically all the creditors have a new business to start with, nothing on the books.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.440
S.J. 100 Matt says, if Dave is going bankrupt, could mean the end of digital life.

05:07.440 --> 05:13.640
I don't know about that, because they were a major sponsor, but I don't know.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.360
We'll see.

05:15.360 --> 05:19.560
I guess that's too bad, though, for them, I guess.

05:19.560 --> 05:25.680
But business sucks sometimes, so hopefully this will be a nice, fresh start for them.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.340
That's what you can usually tell if there's rumors going out about a company going under

05:29.340 --> 05:31.840
when people start selling off their stock.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.840
True.

05:32.840 --> 05:33.840
Anyway.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.680
That's all I got.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.480
Well, how about something that's just a little bit happier, huh?

05:39.480 --> 05:40.480
Sure.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.480
Midway!

05:41.480 --> 05:48.760
We like Midway, except Midway's been losing some money, too, about, well, more around

05:48.760 --> 05:54.560
the amount of $97.4 million last financial year.

05:54.560 --> 06:03.280
So they're trying to cater more towards the casual gamer by having an online portal for

06:03.280 --> 06:05.040
a lot of those games that are out.

06:05.040 --> 06:10.520
I mean, basically, it's just, well, I just completely lost my train of thought.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.520
That's okay.

06:11.520 --> 06:15.400
Midway owns the rights to a lot of classic franchises, though, right?

06:15.400 --> 06:16.400
Yeah.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.400
I mean, Midway, it was, wasn't Midway that brought us out like Mortal Kombat?

06:20.400 --> 06:21.400
Yeah.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.200
Well, I mean, I'm going even further back than that, because I'm thinking about those

06:24.200 --> 06:29.440
like classic packs with like Robotron and Joust and, you know, all that.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.040
They've re-tashed that stuff a thousand times.

06:31.040 --> 06:35.080
I wonder if this is kind of a part of how they're going to launch a more casual games

06:35.080 --> 06:36.080
portal.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.760
Or, because, you know, I could think of casual games as old-school games that were very simple,

06:40.760 --> 06:45.560
or I could think of them as, you know, PopCap-type casual games, like Bejeweled and stuff, that,

06:45.560 --> 06:48.040
again, you know, very easy to pick up and play type games.

06:48.040 --> 06:52.120
I would go in probably with the older games and say, like, re-release that shit over and

06:52.120 --> 06:54.040
over and over and over and over again.

06:54.040 --> 06:58.600
Well, basically, they're only saying that two titles have been out that's used any of

06:58.600 --> 07:04.200
the different type of proprietary technology that they've been working on so far today,

07:04.200 --> 07:06.200
and that was just Stranglehold and Blacksite.

07:06.200 --> 07:12.080
Well, you know, it's unfortunate for Midway, but the games they've released recently haven't

07:12.080 --> 07:13.560
been anything to really scream about.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
I mean, I guess there was Unreal.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.920
I mean, don't get me wrong, but some of those other games just didn't really live up to

07:17.920 --> 07:20.320
the hype, unfortunately.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.320
Which is a bummer, because Midway's given us a lot of great games, too, but I think

07:23.320 --> 07:25.400
they just had a rough 07.

07:25.400 --> 07:30.800
So who knows, I heart classic games, though, and if the Portal is built good, where it

07:30.800 --> 07:37.420
does online high scoreboards and maybe some achievement point type thing and some clever

07:37.420 --> 07:44.960
new little innovative things that make it stand out, I would probably check it out.

07:44.960 --> 07:53.640
So I guess we're coming up on the 10th anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast, and to commemorate

07:53.640 --> 07:59.760
that, Sega of Japan has updated their Dreamcast.com website with a question.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.640
Do you still own a Dreamcast?

08:01.640 --> 08:02.840
Yes.

08:02.840 --> 08:08.560
If you do, what you can do is submit your serial number, and they will basically register

08:08.560 --> 08:14.040
an account with you with user.Dreamcast.com, and you'll get an email, which is your serial

08:14.040 --> 08:18.600
number at Dreamcast.com, Gmail account.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.200
What the hell is that going to do for me?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.200
I don't know.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.200
Maybe there's some more stuff that they're going to do.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.960
Right now, actually, the website's down, so apparently enough people think that that's

08:24.960 --> 08:25.960
interesting.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.920
I could register both of mine.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.800
There's hardcore Sega people out there, hard fucking core Sega people out there.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.920
Jamie's kind of borderline one of them, I think.

08:34.920 --> 08:35.920
I have two Dreamcasts.

08:35.920 --> 08:39.760
Maybe I should register mine so I can have another spam email address.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.760
Why not?

08:40.760 --> 08:41.760
It would be fun.

08:41.760 --> 08:42.760
That's weird, though.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
You just have your serial number.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.940
I mean, it almost makes me wonder, like, wow, could they release an email program for the

08:46.940 --> 08:49.520
Dreamcast or something really weird all these years later?

08:49.520 --> 08:53.320
But yeah, the Dreamcast came out, what, $9,999, but I imagine it was a little bit before that

08:53.320 --> 08:54.320
in Japan, right?

08:54.320 --> 08:55.320
We're bringing it back.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.360
I think that I got my other one in, I want to say, April?

08:59.360 --> 09:01.640
Yeah, it was probably a few months earlier in Japan.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.560
Yeah, because I had my Dreamcast way early.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.920
Yeah, well, why couldn't they?

09:04.920 --> 09:11.680
I mean, that would be kind of cool to bring it back, just make it all open source type

09:11.680 --> 09:12.680
stuff.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
You know what I mean?

09:13.680 --> 09:18.160
I mean, they already have a pretty big open source community for homebrew stuff, but just

09:18.160 --> 09:22.240
a lot of these portable game systems, even like the DS and stuff, aren't that powerful.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.480
I mean, you could probably do a lot on the Dreamcast that you could do on those systems,

09:26.480 --> 09:29.400
so why not?

09:29.400 --> 09:32.960
Well, we'll see what happens, see what this develops into.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.800
I hope we haven't heard the last of the Dreamcast.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.760
Even if it's something, I mean, obviously we don't expect a lot, but even something

09:38.760 --> 09:42.840
little that would be fun, I think them putting out some type of, like, disk image you could

09:42.840 --> 09:47.480
burn and play on your Dreamcast for, like, a 10th anniversary thing would be the cutest

09:47.480 --> 09:48.480
thing.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.480
I mean, it would be fun.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.480
You know we'd all download it and check it out.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.040
Like, a 10th anniversary Choo-Choo Rocket, come on.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
Who wouldn't want to check it out?

09:54.040 --> 09:55.040
You know, I have a press kit for Choo-Choo Rocket.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.040
Do you really?

09:56.040 --> 09:57.520
Yep, somewhere, still complete.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.920
Wow, what kind of special stuff was in it?

09:59.920 --> 10:02.240
Just like pictures and write-ups and stuff about the game.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.040
It was just in a box, a big Choo-Choo Rocket box.

10:05.040 --> 10:10.040
Well, technology has come a long way since the days of the Dreamcast, you know, now we

10:10.040 --> 10:14.800
have the Xbox 360, which are on live and all that stuff, and once you know it, it didn't

10:14.800 --> 10:21.520
take too long before we have yet another story coming from a CBS news station, WCBS-TV in

10:21.520 --> 10:28.680
New York is reporting, and this is the headline, Alarming Trend Online Video Game Predators.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.760
Well, here's what the Predators story is about.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.420
It talks about this boy who's 12 years old.

10:34.420 --> 10:39.580
He loves playing the PlayStation 3 game Burnout Paradise, and he says he plays against strangers

10:39.580 --> 10:43.700
he knows only by their username, and when you cause people to crash, the webcam takes

10:43.700 --> 10:45.240
a snapshot of the player's reaction.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.880
I didn't know it did that on the PlayStation 3, too.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.480
Yeah, with their eye camera.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.480
Interesting.

10:51.480 --> 10:56.520
Well, here's what happened, is that according to the story, apparently things were going

10:56.520 --> 11:02.560
fine and then this guy crashed into somebody and the webcam picture came back, and it was

11:02.560 --> 11:03.560
a butt.

11:03.560 --> 11:08.760
Somebody put their butt on the webcam, but it actually, I don't know, it gets a little

11:08.760 --> 11:14.660
sick because Najee's father, whose name is Charles Johnson, said that the image showed

11:14.660 --> 11:16.380
a lot more than just a butt.

11:16.380 --> 11:20.360
It was a picture of the guy mooning the camera and you could actually see his genitals.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.360
Gross!

11:21.360 --> 11:23.880
Why would you send that picture over?

11:23.880 --> 11:28.520
That takes talent, too, because the camera takes the picture pretty quick, so you'd have

11:28.520 --> 11:32.000
to crash your car in, like, I don't know, you'd have to...

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Or you'd have to have your friends standing there, waiting to go.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.320
Oh, there you go, yeah.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.320
Never thought about that.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.320
Come on!

11:39.320 --> 11:40.440
Come on!

11:40.440 --> 11:44.480
It's one thing to do that to your friends and people on your friends list and stuff

11:44.480 --> 11:49.040
and people you know very well, but it's another to do it to strangers, especially, you know,

11:49.040 --> 11:52.480
when you consider that it might be a 12-year-old kid who's playing the game.

11:52.480 --> 11:57.800
And as sensationalist as the story is, it does make some decent points.

11:57.800 --> 12:03.000
The father said that he thought it would be fine to play because the game is rated E for

12:03.000 --> 12:07.720
everyone, or E10 plus or whatever, however, of course, the ESRB does have that warning.

12:07.720 --> 12:12.000
It's in the beginning of the fucking game, for a second there, and you have to hit a

12:12.000 --> 12:14.040
button to go past it.

12:14.040 --> 12:19.440
But at the same time, I understand that, but at the same time, come on, what fucking moron

12:19.440 --> 12:20.440
did this?

12:20.440 --> 12:25.760
I mean, to show your butt to your friends is one thing, but to show it to complete strangers

12:25.760 --> 12:30.980
when it might be 12-year-old kids playing the game is kind of messed up, and causes

12:30.980 --> 12:35.040
things like this to happen, where now the media runs with it and talks about sexual

12:35.040 --> 12:36.040
predators.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.600
It's because the media- They were probably high, I don't think they're

12:38.600 --> 12:42.600
sexual predators, they're probably drug users, not that that makes it right.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.420
It's because the media has nothing to talk about.

12:44.420 --> 12:49.080
I'll give you a perfect example, we were watching the local news yesterday, and they were talking

12:49.080 --> 12:53.240
about a fire that happened in North Carolina.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.240
We live in California.

12:55.240 --> 13:01.480
I mean, how fucking slow is the news if you're talking about a building fire in another state?

13:01.480 --> 13:07.720
Oh, and then they perceived this show a, what was it, a chicken sledding, and that's how

13:07.720 --> 13:09.260
slow the news was.

13:09.260 --> 13:12.880
That's why they run with this crap, because they can spin it, and it's an interesting

13:12.880 --> 13:13.880
story.

13:13.880 --> 13:19.560
It'll put some, not really put asses in seats, but you know what I mean, tunes people in.

13:19.560 --> 13:23.560
Rob with two Bs pours a little salt in the wound, says California has enough of its own

13:23.560 --> 13:24.560
fires.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.560
Oh.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.560
Not right now they don't.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.880
They're in between fires, C, sir.

13:28.880 --> 13:32.640
Pendro in chat says this, you should be able to rate people as you play them, like feedback

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
on eBay or something.

13:33.640 --> 13:37.600
And of course the 360 has a system kind of like that, but what about PS3?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.280
I'm not sure.

13:39.280 --> 13:43.400
I don't know, maybe.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.480
I think there needs to be a way where something can be done a little more immediately.

13:47.480 --> 13:53.280
I mean, I know on Xbox 360, they swear up and down, they do review that stuff, but there's

13:53.280 --> 13:56.480
got to be something a little more instantaneous that can be done.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.600
You know what I mean?

13:57.600 --> 13:59.040
I don't know.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.840
I don't know if you have to pay people.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.120
My God, dude.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.120
It's a person's ass.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.840
It's not like you're scarred for fucking life.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.960
Well, I kind of see it.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.960
That is kind of nasty, like if you're a 12 year old kid, because they're saying it's

14:11.960 --> 14:16.680
not just his butt, but I guess the whole naughty bits were dangling there too, so you know.

14:16.680 --> 14:17.680
Okay, okay.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.680
Yeah.

14:18.680 --> 14:19.680
I'm so sorry.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.760
Yeah, tomorrow they're going to go out and murder people because they've been severely

14:22.760 --> 14:23.760
scarred.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.400
That's right, you better watch your kids now because now they're going to go on a murderous

14:26.400 --> 14:32.340
rage and go and rape and pillage and fucking, the world is over for you and your family.

14:32.340 --> 14:35.320
Might as well, you know, leave the country.

14:35.320 --> 14:36.320
That's all.

14:36.320 --> 14:41.640
Rasteel UT says, PlayStation 3 lets you block people, but there's no rating system for people.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.800
He also says you're overreacting.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.520
Dark Soccer, you're awfully quiet.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.440
What are your thoughts on this?

14:48.440 --> 14:53.600
It's a butt and it's, you know, dangly bits, I guess.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.720
So you're saying, you know what?

14:55.720 --> 14:58.880
Maybe we should just stop being so frickin' sensitive to...

14:58.880 --> 15:02.480
I really think, that said, if people didn't make a big deal out of this crap, then it

15:02.480 --> 15:04.640
wouldn't, you know, be such an issue.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.640
All right.

15:05.640 --> 15:09.600
Well, if you have some feedback, you know I sent us an email, mailbagorangelanatrader.com,

15:09.600 --> 15:11.560
but regardless, you know what?

15:11.560 --> 15:15.560
Thinking about that this guy was so stupid to do this to strangers kind of pisses me

15:15.560 --> 15:20.240
off and makes me a little bit angsty that this guy was such a moron, so it's time to

15:20.240 --> 15:21.240
have the FUs of the week.

15:21.240 --> 15:43.000
I have a few FUs to compile.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.120
My first one goes, of course, to Daylight Savings Time, because I went to bed at 4.30am

15:48.120 --> 15:51.960
and, of course, woke up at 1.30am.

15:51.960 --> 15:56.280
My next one goes towards the guy who was driving the red pickup truck, which, by the way, was

15:56.280 --> 15:59.600
a Ford, and Ford stands for Fix-Off and Repair Daily.

15:59.600 --> 16:04.760
Anyway, I was in the left lane and he was in the right lane, and then he just cut out

16:04.760 --> 16:09.560
in front of me, like, literally with inches to spare to get into the turning lane on the

16:09.560 --> 16:13.680
left side of me, and I was like, dude, where'd you learn how to drive, you know?

16:13.680 --> 16:17.160
Oh, I'm sorry, you did learn how to drive, if you're driving like that.

16:17.160 --> 16:20.720
I hate stupid people who drive.

16:20.720 --> 16:31.560
And also, another FU goes to my cat for throwing up in an inappropriate place.

16:31.560 --> 16:32.560
Sorry to hear it.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.440
Although, she's a cute baby and I forgive her.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.440
Logie!

16:36.440 --> 16:41.460
FU to this guy named Michael T-something or I don't remember his last name, but apparently

16:41.460 --> 16:49.760
I knew enough because we sat there at dinner on Saturday, no, Friday, I'm sorry, and this

16:49.760 --> 16:54.960
guy went on and on and on and on about his fucking life next to us.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.840
Apparently this couple was on their first date or whatever.

16:57.840 --> 17:01.120
I feel sorry for the woman because this guy just went on and on.

17:01.120 --> 17:08.000
Yeah, one time I had a felony, but they cleared it, so it's all good now, and, you know, I

17:08.000 --> 17:14.160
took in my truck because I'm a, what was it, he was a plumbing inspector, and I took in

17:14.160 --> 17:17.440
my truck one time and they gave me a loaner car and it was an undercover cop car, and

17:17.440 --> 17:22.000
so I drove through the ghetto and everyone was like, oh my god, it's the cops, ah!

17:22.000 --> 17:25.520
Went on and on for two hours and he was still talking the entire time.

17:25.520 --> 17:31.000
I don't think the woman got a word in, so, sucks for, don't meet people on MySpace, this

17:31.000 --> 17:32.960
is what happens.

17:32.960 --> 17:41.320
All right, my FUs of the week go to also Daylight Savings Time, I think it's horrible, and losing

17:41.320 --> 17:47.920
sleep sucks, I hate that, and, gosh, I can't really think of a lot else, I think just Daylight

17:47.920 --> 17:49.960
Savings Time makes up the bulk of my FUs this week.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.600
I think it's unnecessary.

17:51.600 --> 17:55.480
It is a necessary FU, because when you lose sleep, there's never a good thing to come

17:55.480 --> 18:02.040
out of that, so, there you have it, our FUs of the week.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.600
I do want to point this out real quick, Toshin is in our Justin TV chat and says that the

18:06.600 --> 18:14.040
whole Dreamcast thing, says it's a scam, and gives me a link to the Neo GAF forums that

18:14.040 --> 18:17.440
isn't loading for me right now, I'm timing out, so I can't read you the full text of

18:17.440 --> 18:21.120
what it says, but apparently, that Dreamcast thing may not be legitimate.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.120
Eh, who cares, I don't really care.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.520
It's a fucking Dreamcast, what are they going to do with my serial number?

18:26.520 --> 18:29.680
I guess that's true, what can they do with the serial number?

18:29.680 --> 18:33.000
Besides maybe send spam, do you have to give me your email address?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.800
I don't know, I haven't signed up, the site's down, so...

18:35.800 --> 18:38.520
Well, maybe it got taken down for being a big scam!

18:38.520 --> 18:42.160
No, there's an error thing, I think it's just too many people are trying to access it at

18:42.160 --> 18:44.160
one time.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.160
Alright.

18:46.160 --> 18:52.320
Well, let's go ahead and get back into some gaming news.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.640
Oh, actually, no, we're going to go and actually check out the mailbag.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.720
Maybe I should pay attention to the schedule once in a while.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.720
Maybe so.

18:59.720 --> 19:00.720
Maybe I should.

19:00.720 --> 19:01.720
Did we get a lot of emails this week?

19:01.720 --> 19:03.440
I didn't see a lot in there earlier.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.440
You know why?

19:04.440 --> 19:08.360
Because Part B got screwed up, and that's where we had the mailbag last time, so I feel

19:08.360 --> 19:10.280
very sorry for all those people who...

19:10.280 --> 19:12.080
Oh, shoot, I moved all those emails out.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.080
That's alright.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.080
No, that's alright.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.080
Just because I read them.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.520
Yeah, because you read them last week, and technically they were on the show, they just

19:16.520 --> 19:20.120
weren't on the podcast, which kind of sucks for those people, so we're very sorry.

19:20.120 --> 19:25.920
You'll have to email us again, or look for The Lost Show or something, I don't know.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.560
But regardless, we are going to open up the mailbag, because we did get at least a couple

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
emails, right?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.560
A couple.

19:31.560 --> 19:35.560
And that's enough for us to open up the mailbag and jump on in, so fill up the mailbag.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.520
Give Jamie a lot of work to do next week.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.520
Mailbag at orangelandarita.com.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.520
Here we go.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.520
My tongue.

19:40.520 --> 19:53.000
The first email of the week is actually from Cheeseburger asking us to play the intro to

19:53.000 --> 19:58.040
Castlevania 64.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.680
Make me play the intro from a good game and we'll do it.

20:00.680 --> 20:06.960
Uh, well, he actually emailed us, actually, no, I take that back, that wasn't from Cheeseburger,

20:06.960 --> 20:11.960
it was from, god, now I have to go in that folder to find out who it was, because he

20:11.960 --> 20:17.280
emailed us something else, but I can't read half of it on the air, because it involves

20:17.280 --> 20:21.960
finding a broken DS and using their serial number to replace it, and we're not going

20:21.960 --> 20:22.960
to do that.

20:22.960 --> 20:27.360
We're not going to do that, I'm sorry.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.680
Not after the debates we've been in the past couple weeks, I think maybe that email is

20:30.680 --> 20:31.680
best unread.

20:31.680 --> 20:36.880
But also, he's saying something about, do Koopa and Purin exist in Super Smash Bros.

20:36.880 --> 20:37.880
Melee?

20:37.880 --> 20:43.600
I think he means Brawl, basically, he was saying that if you change the language, Bowser

20:43.600 --> 20:49.480
becomes Koopa and Jigglypuff becomes Purin, which were their original names, and then

20:49.480 --> 20:52.360
you can save them that way?

20:52.360 --> 20:58.860
I don't know what you mean, so, sorry, that's the only other email.

20:58.860 --> 21:06.040
And by the way, that one that I lost was from somebody named Jake.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.440
You lost an email?

21:07.440 --> 21:14.960
No, it's, he didn't put a signature on there, the one that I mistakenly gave to Cheeseburger.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.960
Oh.

21:15.960 --> 21:16.960
So.

21:16.960 --> 21:17.960
That's it?

21:17.960 --> 21:20.440
We didn't get any, like, real email.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.440
Weak.

21:21.440 --> 21:28.320
Except some spam that I'm deleting right now that's titled LOL.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.080
And Rob did it!

21:31.080 --> 21:32.080
What's that?

21:32.080 --> 21:34.080
It's titled LOL and you laughed.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.080
LOL.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.080
I did.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.080
LOL.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.080
Loss.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.080
Weak mailbag.

21:39.080 --> 21:42.800
I'm disappointed in all of you, but then again, I blame not having a Part B last week where

21:42.800 --> 21:48.880
we actually had a mailbag to remind you that you can send us emails, so send us emails.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.520
Are you a hardcore gamer?

21:50.520 --> 21:51.520
Yes.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.520
Have you downloaded the hardcore gamer pack yet?

21:53.520 --> 21:54.520
No!

21:54.520 --> 21:55.880
Well then you're not really a hardcore gamer.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.160
Oh my god, how dare you!

21:58.160 --> 21:59.160
Exactly.

21:59.160 --> 22:04.520
On Xbox Live Marketplace, there is a brand new hardcore gamer picture pack, featuring

22:04.520 --> 22:11.360
such wonderful pictures as Proud to be a Noob, Camper, Respawn, a little target symbol, and

22:11.360 --> 22:12.360
T-Bag.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.360
Yes, T-Bag.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.360
Why?

22:14.360 --> 22:21.960
If you really want to buy this, it's only $1.25 and yes, all people will know that you're

22:21.960 --> 22:26.240
truly hardcore if you buy this and display them proudly.

22:26.240 --> 22:31.720
Or I would like to point out that for free, you can download Community Gamer Picks, and

22:31.720 --> 22:35.800
we're in pack number two of the Community Gamer Picks, and there's a little pick that

22:35.800 --> 22:40.760
says OLR, and if you put that on your gamertag, at least we'll know you're hardcore, as will

22:40.760 --> 22:42.320
all the rest of the OLR me.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.960
So don't download this crap.

22:44.960 --> 22:45.960
Don't pay for this.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.960
Yeah, these look really stupid.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.620
SSG100Matt sums up my thoughts exactly.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.440
Why do they need to endorse stupidity that is T-Bagging?

22:53.440 --> 22:56.720
I don't know, maybe we should ask disruptive media publishers.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.720
I think we should!

22:57.720 --> 22:59.480
Do we have a telephone number?

22:59.480 --> 23:01.400
Let's call them right now, I'm sure they're there.

23:01.400 --> 23:04.200
I don't know, let me get on that.

23:04.200 --> 23:08.840
We'll send them an email maybe this week, we'll see.

23:08.840 --> 23:12.440
Are you going to download the Hardcore Gamer Picks, Loki?

23:12.440 --> 23:14.480
No, I'm doing it right now.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.480
Oh wow.

23:16.480 --> 23:23.480
Well, what's pretty hardcore as well is proposing to your significant other over a video game,

23:23.480 --> 23:24.880
but do you know what's really hardcore?

23:24.880 --> 23:28.400
I remember last year we had this story, I think we had a Viva Pinata story, we had an

23:28.400 --> 23:34.440
Animal Crossing story, I want to say, and this time, this is kind of interesting, he

23:34.440 --> 23:42.400
actually made a homebrew version of his significant other's favorite game, which was Bejeweled.

23:42.400 --> 23:46.640
He made a homebrew version of this on the DS, and this guy Bernie, he's actually a user

23:46.640 --> 23:51.800
on Zanga, what he did, he spent a few weeks actually making this Nintendo DS version of

23:51.800 --> 23:56.680
Bejeweled completely from the ground up, and what happens is that once the game gets to

23:56.680 --> 24:02.360
a certain score, the screen clears, and then what would happen is that a ring of the jewels

24:02.360 --> 24:06.600
comes up on the screen, and what he did is that when his girlfriend was playing the game

24:06.600 --> 24:13.580
and then got on the special screen, Bernie actually had a real ring there and proposed.

24:13.580 --> 24:17.640
Everybody, awww.

24:17.640 --> 24:22.740
Sorry, hairball.

24:22.740 --> 24:28.900
But no, that is definitely dedication to build a game to propose to your significant other

24:28.900 --> 24:29.900
with.

24:29.900 --> 24:33.340
hardcore. So, good for you.

24:33.340 --> 24:34.420
That is pretty cool.

24:34.420 --> 24:39.220
I was just going to say, if you would like to email Disruptive Media Publishers and tell

24:39.220 --> 24:46.220
them how crappy those hardcore gamer pics are, you can email them at info at disruptivepublishers.com.

24:48.820 --> 24:55.820
Also have a mailing address on disruptivepublishers.com, so check it out. They're in Bellingham, Washington.

24:55.820 --> 25:01.060
Ossifer in chat suggests, teabag your girlfriend for instant marriage.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.860
They also have a Facebook community, too.

25:03.860 --> 25:04.740
Let her know you're hardcore.

25:04.740 --> 25:08.460
Because all the cool kids are on Facebook, man.

25:08.460 --> 25:15.460
Teabagger. Right, DarkSakura? If Dan teabagged you in Halo, that's love, right?

25:16.580 --> 25:17.700
My silence is my answer.

25:17.700 --> 25:21.660
I'm getting blinked at. Perhaps we should move on, then.

25:21.660 --> 25:28.660
Well, for anyone who's a fan of Undertow, there is an expansion out, but it costs. However,

25:29.300 --> 25:35.500
it is only 200 Microsoft points, as opposed to 400, so if this is a boo-boo, go ahead

25:35.500 --> 25:37.420
and get it, if you care.

25:37.420 --> 25:41.660
Except I should point out the boo-boo has now been fixed. It's still 400 points now.

25:41.660 --> 25:44.240
Aw, poor babies.

25:44.240 --> 25:52.140
At any rate, though, there is some information on an expansion, Path of the Elect. It's five

25:52.140 --> 25:58.460
levels, you have a new alien race called the Elect, wow, and four multiplayer maps, so

25:58.460 --> 26:03.460
there's no other details than that. And, yeah, it's been fixed.

26:03.460 --> 26:08.540
Huh. Well, it was free for, I mean, the game was free for a while, you know, to make up

26:08.540 --> 26:12.780
for Xbox Live outages, although I'm not sure if that's really more of a punishment for

26:12.780 --> 26:16.420
us or for, you know, thank you, I don't really...

26:16.420 --> 26:21.580
I can't say I was an Undertow fan, but, you know, it's hard to bitch when something's

26:21.580 --> 26:27.140
free. It's really hard to complain. Then again, I think about Totem Ball and Yaris, and there's

26:27.140 --> 26:33.820
been some real shit free games on Xbox Live, but then, like, Age's Wing wasn't bad. It

26:33.820 --> 26:38.060
wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. It was no Yaris, come on.

26:38.060 --> 26:45.460
Yeah, so, I don't know. Yaris is unforgivable. I will never buy a Yaris because of that.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.860
And, yeah, they suck.

26:47.860 --> 26:56.180
So, there is a rumor that there's going to be a price cut coming for European Xbox 360s,

26:56.180 --> 27:00.700
and apparently the price cut is supposed to happen on March 14th. It's going to be a price

27:00.700 --> 27:06.940
cut of 50 Euros, and I guess we'll see if this actually happens. It's being reported

27:06.940 --> 27:15.620
by TechRadar, and apparently they got the news of a new SKU. So, numerous well-placed

27:15.620 --> 27:21.340
game industry sources, they said, have confirmed it. And that would bring a price, I guess,

27:21.340 --> 27:31.420
of the 360 to 250 Euros for the arcade pack, and around 100 and... I'm sorry, 250 Euros

27:31.420 --> 27:40.060
for the 360, and then the arcade would be 197 Euros. So, I don't know. Hopefully that

27:40.060 --> 27:42.740
happens, but I guess we'll find out soon if that's the case.

27:42.740 --> 27:46.940
Well, price cuts aren't a bad thing. I mean, I cannot think of a story where we've talked

27:46.940 --> 27:51.820
about a price cut and it was a bad thing. So...

27:51.820 --> 27:52.820
I'm thinking.

27:52.820 --> 27:56.740
I know Loki, the devil's advocate here on the program, trying to think of something.

27:56.740 --> 28:01.180
I'm sure there's the chat as well. Well, you think about that while I report on this. Other

28:01.180 --> 28:10.100
worldly news, Asia is finally going to be getting Guitar Hero. And what's kind of interesting,

28:10.100 --> 28:13.060
Blizzard is actually going to be helping the game actually come to Asia, because you know

28:13.060 --> 28:18.020
how Activision just recently combined with Blizzard? Well, Blizzard has the institutional

28:18.020 --> 28:24.300
expertise to bring Guitar Hero to places like China and Korea. And if you kind of think

28:24.300 --> 28:26.380
about it, Blizzard did launch World of Warcraft.

28:26.380 --> 28:28.300
I know how they're doing it.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.460
They're going to have it where if you play the game well enough, you gain experience

28:31.460 --> 28:33.540
in World of Warcraft on your account.

28:33.540 --> 28:41.060
Who knows? Who knows? Apparently, the Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has also said this. He's

28:41.060 --> 28:46.300
brought up the possibility of maybe putting other instruments in Guitar Hero, which would

28:46.300 --> 28:49.180
be no surprise if you remember our story on DJ Hero's trademark last week.

28:49.180 --> 28:52.700
I've got a totally great idea. This has never been attempted ever before. We're going to

28:52.700 --> 28:58.280
put singing and drums in the game. And guess what? We also may put keyboards. Never been

28:58.280 --> 29:00.580
done before on the face of the Earth. We are the first.

29:00.580 --> 29:03.420
And then we're going to have a turntable and five to seven keys.

29:03.420 --> 29:07.260
They need a Zither Hero.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.260
I still want Satara Hero.

29:08.260 --> 29:11.340
Where are our awards for originality and innovation?

29:11.340 --> 29:14.060
Give me DigiRedo Hero. That's original.

29:14.060 --> 29:21.740
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

29:21.740 --> 29:23.820
DigiRedo Hero would rock. And you know it.

29:23.820 --> 29:30.500
Anyway, Clarinet Hero.

29:30.500 --> 29:36.180
To continue on, though, with Guitar Hero information, for Guitar Hero 3, in time for St. Patrick's

29:36.180 --> 29:43.500
Day, there is going to be a pack with stuff by Dropkick Murphys, which is pretty cool.

29:43.500 --> 29:49.580
There will be Famous for Nothing, Flanagan's Ball, and Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya. So that's

29:49.580 --> 29:50.860
pretty cool.

29:50.860 --> 29:55.020
And also right now there's a modern metal pack out, though, that has some cool stuff

29:55.020 --> 29:57.700
on it, too.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.460
How very holiday appropriate.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.460
That's an interesting...

30:01.460 --> 30:07.780
I like Dropkick Murphys, but I like Flogging Molly better. And I would have gone with them.

30:07.780 --> 30:13.900
So I was on YouTube looking for DigiRedo clips so I could, you know, hypothesize what DigiRedo

30:13.900 --> 30:20.180
Hero might sound like. Keep in mind I've never heard this, but this says DigiRedo Techno.

30:20.180 --> 30:21.180
This could be horrible.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.180
It's pretty sweet, actually.

30:22.180 --> 30:23.180
That's actually pretty fucking rad.

30:23.180 --> 30:24.180
That is really cool.

30:24.180 --> 30:25.180
Oh my god, this Aboriginal guy on the streets, this is live. He actually has a little techno

30:25.180 --> 30:26.180
thing and he's playing the didgeridoo to this.

30:26.180 --> 30:27.180
I'd buy that.

30:27.180 --> 30:53.020
I would buy that in a heartbeat.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.740
It's fucking sweet.

30:55.740 --> 30:56.740
So hardcore.

30:56.740 --> 30:57.740
That's awesome.

30:57.740 --> 30:58.740
I like that song.

30:58.740 --> 31:02.580
I am going to link that YouTube. Search for it. It's Didgeridoo Techno on YouTube.

31:02.580 --> 31:03.580
That's pretty sweet.

31:03.580 --> 31:10.140
If you know how to spell didgeridoo. D-I-D-G-E-R-I-D-O-O. I'm going to put that in my favorites on YouTube.

31:10.140 --> 31:14.980
I think that was pretty rad. I'll actually put that in the OLR favorites right now. Check

31:14.980 --> 31:17.020
that out. That's pretty awesome.

31:17.020 --> 31:25.060
All right, sorry, we can go back to real gaming news now. I'll stop the didgeridoo.

31:25.060 --> 31:27.540
I'm telling you, man, this guy needs to put out a fucking album.

31:27.540 --> 31:28.540
Seriously.

31:28.540 --> 31:29.540
That's sweet.

31:29.540 --> 31:33.300
Look, we need to get him on the show. I want a new, I mean, with all due respect to Midi

31:33.300 --> 31:37.900
Head and the great OLR theme he made us, he's an awesome guy. I do think it's time to maybe

31:37.900 --> 31:42.700
get a fresh Orange Lounge Radio theme in here and I demand Didgeridoo in the theme.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.540
And Auto Harp.

31:45.540 --> 31:46.540
Somebody needs to make that happen.

31:46.540 --> 31:48.980
That is fucking awesome.

31:48.980 --> 31:58.180
All right. Orange Lounge Radio, wah, wah, wah, sky, dark, soccer, Loki, wah, wah, wah.

31:58.180 --> 32:01.260
Anyway, sorry.

32:01.260 --> 32:02.260
So, Loki, SingStar.

32:02.260 --> 32:04.940
Sorry, I was so distracted by Didgeridoo stuff.

32:04.940 --> 32:10.740
I know. It has that effect on people.

32:10.740 --> 32:15.540
Even though we still haven't gotten it over here yet, there is a second PS3 SingStar on

32:15.540 --> 32:19.540
the way. But, wait, why is there a second SingStar on the way? Because I thought there

32:19.540 --> 32:23.380
was a whole SingStar with tons of songs that you can download from other SingStar games

32:23.380 --> 32:24.380
already.

32:24.380 --> 32:30.380
Well, apparently it's just going to be some new content, hopefully, but apparently Aussie

32:30.380 --> 32:35.940
Retail Systems have noticed a new SKU for SingStar Volume 2, which is apparently due

32:35.940 --> 32:41.740
in June. So, Australia may see another SingStar game, although we over here in the United

32:41.740 --> 32:44.140
States are still waiting for the first SingStar game.

32:44.140 --> 32:46.420
We actually have a clip of one of the new songs from SingStar.

32:46.420 --> 32:59.980
Okay, I promise that's the last time.

32:59.980 --> 33:05.940
The ESRB is taking a little heat this week because one of the ex-employees has come out

33:05.940 --> 33:10.340
and really slammed the ESRB. The guy's name, Jerry Bonner, that's pretty brave to put

33:10.340 --> 33:12.980
your name out there, by the way, when you do this kind of stuff.

33:12.980 --> 33:17.780
He actually was working as a full-time rater person for the ESRB. He worked for six months,

33:17.780 --> 33:22.580
and now he's come out as being critical of the way that the ESRB is doing its job. And

33:22.580 --> 33:26.620
he actually came out and said these are some factors that need changing. He's complaining

33:26.620 --> 33:31.980
that the ESRB needs to actually play the games at rates. Oh, snap, because you know, have

33:31.980 --> 33:36.780
you heard that? That the ESRB actually, the publishers send information to the ESRB, they

33:36.780 --> 33:40.940
don't always play the games. It's kind of, I swear that's how it works. It's very interesting.

33:40.940 --> 33:45.660
I know they can't play it all the way through. Usually they get a clip or a video of like

33:45.660 --> 33:50.380
gameplay footage that's, you know, supposed to be the most violent or, you know, obscene

33:50.380 --> 33:54.600
stuff in the game. And then they make their ratings based on that.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.780
Which is why, you know, things like Hot Coffee were so controversial, because that was omitted.

33:58.780 --> 34:02.140
But I mean, we're not going to go over that whole thing again. But anyhow, here's the

34:02.140 --> 34:08.320
other big thing. The guy also says that sequels are not judged on their own merits, but rather

34:08.320 --> 34:11.100
the merits of the games before it.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.460
Okay, that's stupid.

34:12.460 --> 34:17.460
That is crazy. Here's some of the bullet points from what this guy suggests should be changed.

34:17.460 --> 34:23.980
Drop the AO rating and add a new rating that's called T16, presumably for 16 years and up.

34:23.980 --> 34:28.780
Play through the games all the way. Stop rating sequels according to the content and their

34:28.780 --> 34:37.220
predecessors and be more open and don't be so secretive. And if it's true, that's going

34:37.220 --> 34:40.980
to be a huge kick in the face, if like a lot of this is true.

34:40.980 --> 34:44.100
Well, they've already come out and said, oh, well, blah, blah, blah. You know, we don't

34:44.100 --> 34:48.820
support his views and all that stuff. And we're the ESRB. We're awesome. You know, that

34:48.820 --> 34:49.820
kind of thing.

34:49.820 --> 34:53.180
Those sound like fair requests to me, though. I don't know if it's just me, but it sounds

34:53.180 --> 34:56.660
very fair to me. What do you think about those revelations, Dark Sakura? I mean, is this

34:56.660 --> 34:57.660
going to...

34:57.660 --> 34:58.660
Not at all surprised?

34:58.660 --> 35:04.780
Yeah, but I mean, you know, we kind of rely on the ESRB as gamers when we kind of, you

35:04.780 --> 35:08.380
know, when these games come out and all these horrible things happen. Like, take the butt

35:08.380 --> 35:13.380
story from Burnout earlier. We go, well, the ESRB did say the rating is subject to change.

35:13.380 --> 35:18.500
But if the ESRB gets discredited with stuff like this, this really screws us in a way.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.580
I don't know. It's kind of sad.

35:21.580 --> 35:25.780
It's a... I honestly think it's a sort of a corrupt institution anyway.

35:25.780 --> 35:30.260
Ross Steele UT has said that Patricia Vance has already come out and denied it. Well,

35:30.260 --> 35:33.460
that seems like a given, though. So, I mean, it is kind of a qua... You know, obviously

35:33.460 --> 35:38.380
take it as a rumor for now, but it certainly is a question. I have heard from, you know,

35:38.380 --> 35:42.720
inside folks, and I'm pretty sure it's out there on the internet also, that ESRB doesn't

35:42.720 --> 35:48.300
necessarily play through the games. They will rate based on stuff that you send them. So,

35:48.300 --> 35:53.460
kind of interesting. And I remember overhearing at a trade show once about people, and I think

35:53.460 --> 35:55.940
you were there too, Loki. I don't know if you ever heard this same conversation, but

35:55.940 --> 36:02.080
about how a particular game I'm thinking of, a particular game with... I don't even want

36:02.080 --> 36:05.460
to say, because I don't want people to speculate, but a particular game, I heard the two developers

36:05.460 --> 36:10.960
kind of... The developer joking with another really big industry press person about how

36:10.960 --> 36:16.300
they got this through the ESRB with a particular rating. I just was kind of shocked to hear

36:16.300 --> 36:21.300
that kind of talk. So, interesting. Anyhow.

36:21.300 --> 36:28.700
Well, there... You know, just to move away from the ESRB and how crappy they are.

36:28.700 --> 36:29.700
Let's.

36:29.700 --> 36:33.820
Yes. Skype is actually coming out on Japanese PSPs this month.

36:33.820 --> 36:34.820
Woohoo!

36:34.820 --> 36:43.260
So, it will be on March 18th, and it's only, of course, for the slim PSP, the newer one,

36:43.260 --> 36:50.700
and it's supposed to be a month later over here in the US. Also, the microphone attachment

36:50.700 --> 36:54.700
is going to be 2,500 yen, or two for 4,000.

36:54.700 --> 36:55.700
Hmm.

36:55.700 --> 36:57.420
So, that's not bad.

36:57.420 --> 36:59.420
Not bad at all.

36:59.420 --> 37:04.500
I'm glad that Japanese PSP users will get to use this. Good call.

37:04.500 --> 37:07.580
And then we'll be able to do it a month later.

37:07.580 --> 37:12.020
We already have it. We got our first call last week on the Skype line from a Skype PSP

37:12.020 --> 37:13.020
user.

37:13.020 --> 37:14.020
Huh.

37:14.020 --> 37:20.980
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is going to be due out here next month, and they have released

37:20.980 --> 37:27.940
the full list of cars and tracks that are going to be included in that. Tons of different

37:27.940 --> 37:38.180
stuff you can pick from, I believe, was it, I want to say like 65 cars and 6 tracks, including

37:38.180 --> 37:47.120
the Suzuka Circuit, the Eiger Nordwand, Fuji Speedway, London City Track, Daytona International

37:47.120 --> 37:52.420
Speedway, and the High Speed Ring, and a bunch of different cars. I don't even know what

37:52.420 --> 37:57.920
to even cover on that, but lots of stuff to keep you satisfied until the full game comes

37:57.920 --> 37:58.920
out.

37:58.920 --> 38:03.980
Also, it's going to have a brand new drift mode for the US version, as well as the ability

38:03.980 --> 38:10.980
to fine tune your car, and two player split screen racing, and I guess a new set of events.

38:10.980 --> 38:15.660
Not bad for 40 bucks.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.860
So that's not just Prologue, that's the full game, right?

38:18.860 --> 38:19.860
No, that's Prologue.

38:19.860 --> 38:21.340
Oh, that's just Prologue.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.340
Yeah.

38:22.340 --> 38:27.500
Okay. What was I going to say? Seems a little weak for the full game. Alright. That's cool.

38:27.500 --> 38:33.820
Well, if racing isn't your thing, maybe cheering is. Yay! There is a new cheering game coming

38:33.820 --> 38:38.340
out for the Wii and the DS. It's called All Star Cheer Squad, and it's coming to you from

38:38.340 --> 38:44.100
THQ. It's going to be again for the Wii and the DS, and if you're on the Wii, get this,

38:44.100 --> 38:49.200
you get to use the balance board. So you won't just be cheering with your, you can cheer

38:49.200 --> 38:53.300
with your feet and everything. Won't this be fun?

38:53.300 --> 38:58.820
And here's the thing, the game is actually, just to give it authenticity, it's choreographed

38:58.820 --> 39:05.660
by Tony Gee, who also choreographed the movie Bring It On. So that actually, you know, I

39:05.660 --> 39:13.020
have to admit, it actually sounds kind of fun. Doesn't the All Star Cheer Squad sound

39:13.020 --> 39:15.420
just slightly fun, Dark Sakura?

39:15.420 --> 39:16.420
Slightly.

39:16.420 --> 39:17.420
Like to play once?

39:17.420 --> 39:22.540
It sounds as much fun as going to the dentist. Although my dentist is pretty cool.

39:22.540 --> 39:27.340
Do you know how much money I would pay for a YouTube of Loki playing All Star Cheer Squad?

39:27.340 --> 39:30.260
There's no money in the world.

39:30.260 --> 39:35.580
Maybe that'll be the next bet. Whenever we find another bet for Loki to take on, we'll

39:35.580 --> 39:42.340
get him to play All Star Cheer Squad in the Tingle outfit.

39:42.340 --> 39:47.100
We need to make this happen somehow. We will be opening the Skype line after this next

39:47.100 --> 39:53.740
story. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Go ahead and give

39:53.740 --> 39:57.020
us a call after this story.

39:57.020 --> 40:05.220
Well, for people who were fans of the Castlevania series and collect action figures, it doesn't

40:05.220 --> 40:14.060
look like we're going to really be getting the new figures that they were discussing.

40:14.060 --> 40:21.300
I mean, basically, they were asked if there were going to be any more in that Castlevania

40:21.300 --> 40:28.460
line and it was reported that there were no plans at all and no news on Castlevania figures

40:28.460 --> 40:32.980
and that they will not be revisiting the license.

40:32.980 --> 40:34.380
Well that's kind of a bummer.

40:34.380 --> 40:36.340
I want a Richter figure, dang it.

40:36.340 --> 40:37.340
Richter.

40:37.340 --> 40:42.900
If you're going to say it, you have to say it right.

40:42.900 --> 40:49.020
Skype line is open. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. While we're

40:49.020 --> 40:51.620
waiting for some calls, how about some last minute stories? Do you have anything for us

40:51.620 --> 40:52.620
tonight, Loki?

40:52.620 --> 40:57.620
Actually, I don't.

40:57.620 --> 41:00.180
What? We've actually covered everything?

41:00.180 --> 41:03.540
Well, I mean, I'm sure there's some other stuff.

41:03.540 --> 41:08.180
Well, thank God a call's coming in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

41:08.180 --> 41:14.020
Hi, this is Ross Steel UT. Let me turn the speakers down. Sorry about that.

41:14.020 --> 41:17.460
No, that's all right. What's on your mind, Ross Steel UT?

41:17.460 --> 41:24.020
Not much. I want to talk about the whole thing with the guy whose 360 got wiped clean.

41:24.020 --> 41:29.660
Yeah, and then Bungie actually had to fix it and all that stuff. What's your thoughts

41:29.660 --> 41:30.660
on that?

41:30.660 --> 41:35.900
Well, much love to Bungie, but where the fuck is Microsoft? They said they were going to

41:35.900 --> 41:40.500
help the guy, and then we haven't heard from them since.

41:40.500 --> 41:44.500
But isn't Bungie like it? No, because they split. I keep wanting to say, oh, but Bungie

41:44.500 --> 41:45.500
is a person.

41:45.500 --> 41:50.580
Well, they split, but it still wasn't Bungie's fault. That's the thing. This isn't some sort

41:50.580 --> 41:56.180
of little casual accident, because from what I understand, the console was marked as permanent

41:56.180 --> 42:03.620
marker. Whoever did this had to really get in there, you know what I mean?

42:03.620 --> 42:09.460
I always thought that they just gave the console a different shell, but I guess it was actually

42:09.460 --> 42:10.460
real.

42:10.460 --> 42:21.580
Actually, if you go to Hard and McBloggy, let me put a link. They show a picture of the

42:21.580 --> 42:28.700
console in question, and you'll still see a few little smudge marks. So that is the

42:28.700 --> 42:33.860
console. They just got to work cleaning it off.

42:33.860 --> 42:34.860
That is so weird.

42:34.860 --> 42:39.820
I think they all go through some sort of power wash.

42:39.820 --> 42:41.580
Like a high pressure wash.

42:41.580 --> 42:44.500
Oh, to make your Xbox look new again?

42:44.500 --> 42:45.500
Yeah.

42:45.500 --> 42:46.500
Basically, yeah.

42:46.500 --> 42:52.700
That's interesting. I wonder if... Oh, my gosh. Oh, yeah, and you can see. Oh, thanks

42:52.700 --> 42:55.700
for the link to the blog. That's interesting. You can totally see how some of the ink is

42:55.700 --> 43:01.860
just rubbed off. So that's how you might put your ring or something. I'm thinking last

43:01.860 --> 43:05.860
weekend I watched my friend get her engagement ring washed, and they have a machine that

43:05.860 --> 43:09.980
does it, make it look new again. It's kind of that type of thing. Make your Xbox 360

43:09.980 --> 43:10.980
look new again.

43:10.980 --> 43:11.980
That's weird.

43:11.980 --> 43:18.300
Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm not surprised by Microsoft having incompetent

43:18.300 --> 43:26.860
tech support. I had my 360 sent in early November, and I got a refurb, and it took me four

43:26.860 --> 43:32.740
months to finally get my XBLA games revalidated to the console. Needless to say, I'm never

43:32.740 --> 43:34.300
buying anything off the marketplace again.

43:34.300 --> 43:40.520
That is a big mess. When I sent my Xbox 360 back, thankfully, I only had two arcade games

43:40.520 --> 43:44.160
purchased at the time, and they're not ones I play super... Well, I take that back. Joust

43:44.160 --> 43:47.980
was one. I haven't played that in a while, but Geometry Wars was the other. Thankfully,

43:47.980 --> 43:51.860
I haven't had much issues, because since it is tied to your Xbox Live name, it recognizes

43:51.860 --> 43:56.220
me and all that stuff, and it lets me play the full version, but I do have to wait a

43:56.220 --> 43:59.500
couple seconds. Obviously, I'm not going to get frustrated over a couple seconds, but

43:59.500 --> 44:03.300
I'm just thinking I've heard of other people who've lost a lot more than two arcade games,

44:03.300 --> 44:04.300
and it's just a pain in the ass.

44:04.300 --> 44:14.700
Well, the problem with XBLA is that you cannot play your stuff offline if you do a refurb.

44:14.700 --> 44:18.740
You have to be online at all times. A couple of days ago, my internet was on the first

44:18.740 --> 44:23.780
time I couldn't do that, so there goes Geometry Wars, there goes Symphony of the Night, Contra,

44:23.780 --> 44:24.780
a few others.

44:24.780 --> 44:28.940
Is this true? Darktitsuya points out that this isn't just a Microsoft thing. He says

44:28.940 --> 44:33.460
in chat, it's the same with Virtual Console. When I got my Wii back, I had to redownload

44:33.460 --> 44:36.460
them, but they didn't cost extra. They were free to replace. Well, that's not so bad.

44:36.460 --> 44:37.580
At least it worked, then.

44:37.580 --> 44:41.140
Well, yeah. At least you can use them without being online. That's the important thing.

44:41.140 --> 44:42.140
I guess that's true.

44:42.140 --> 44:49.540
I mean, if I got to download it again, sure, whatever. But this just struck me as an especially

44:49.540 --> 44:54.380
evil thing to do to somebody, because there's no reason to do that, especially as the guy

44:54.380 --> 44:57.940
said, hey, I don't want my thing cleaned.

44:57.940 --> 45:04.440
I would understand. If Microsoft did this whole power wash thing, I could understand

45:04.440 --> 45:08.480
how they might miss the special request and just everything goes on the assembly line.

45:08.480 --> 45:12.920
They don't pay really any attention to it. It's fix, line, fix. But I think Microsoft

45:12.920 --> 45:16.580
should at least come out and let us know publicly that that's what happened, like I do.

45:16.580 --> 45:21.420
Because Microsoft is so out there in the community. They worked really hard. They have, what,

45:21.420 --> 45:26.540
Gamerscore Blog, Major Nelson, and all these people. I'm sure these people are aware of

45:26.540 --> 45:31.540
this negative story being out there on the blog. So I really think Microsoft will say

45:31.540 --> 45:34.620
something about it eventually and kind of admit, oops, my bad.

45:34.620 --> 45:40.340
The problem is that Microsoft, for everything they do in the community, there's a million

45:40.340 --> 45:46.180
horror stories. There's the alarming amount of red rings. There's the nightmare with getting

45:46.180 --> 45:51.740
your stuff validated on your console so you can use it offline again. And then there's

45:51.740 --> 45:57.440
this. It really makes you wonder if the left hand even knows what the right hand is doing.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.660
What do you want to bet, though? I mean, all that aside, what do you want to bet, though,

45:59.660 --> 46:03.660
the reason why Bungie did this for this guy is that somebody at Microsoft saw this story

46:03.660 --> 46:06.300
on the blogs, their community outreach people, and made a phone call.

46:06.300 --> 46:10.540
Oh, I'm sure they were like, yeah, could you help us out here?

46:10.540 --> 46:17.100
Yeah, exactly. We fucked up. Can you save our ass? It happens. It happens.

46:17.100 --> 46:27.860
Anyway, on better Microsoft news, the Financial Times is reporting that Microsoft might be

46:27.860 --> 46:32.300
considering more Blu-ray support. Some people have even speculated a Blu-ray draw for the

46:32.300 --> 46:33.300
360.

46:33.300 --> 46:36.980
I have heard about that, that Microsoft is supposedly in talks with Sony about the whole

46:36.980 --> 46:41.900
Blu-ray add-on, which is a very strange kind of marriage, but I guess one step that Microsoft

46:41.900 --> 46:43.900
might have to make at this point.

46:43.900 --> 46:46.060
Well, might have to make. They do have to make.

46:46.060 --> 46:47.060
Well, do they?

46:47.060 --> 46:54.100
You have to understand the majority of people on a console at the end aren't going to be

46:54.100 --> 46:58.540
online, so you're going to have to have the sort of offline option.

46:58.540 --> 47:00.020
How come the Wii doesn't have to do it?

47:00.020 --> 47:07.940
Because the Wii is not being marketed as a media center. We've had this conversation

47:07.940 --> 47:14.900
before. It's being marketed on, oh, look at the cute little novelty controller.

47:14.900 --> 47:22.220
As you start adding in the forecast channel, the news channel, the TV Guide channel, all

47:22.220 --> 47:27.680
this other stuff, it's a different type of center of sorts.

47:27.680 --> 47:36.420
I don't know. I just don't see the marketing in the sort of multimedia center of the home

47:36.420 --> 47:38.140
thing.

47:38.140 --> 47:44.020
I agree with Frisbee. I don't need it to be, but it's also Microsoft.

47:44.020 --> 47:50.140
The only thing that might stop this is that Microsoft doesn't want to be seen as admitting

47:50.140 --> 47:56.500
picking a losing side, that they pretty much had to give away those HD DVD add-ons, which

47:56.500 --> 47:57.500
I thought was funny.

47:57.500 --> 48:01.580
You know what? I've got to wrap up so we can get some other calls, but here's the thing.

48:01.580 --> 48:05.220
I would kind of close on this. I would bet that Microsoft doesn't end up doing it, and

48:05.220 --> 48:06.820
they'll just build it into their next system.

48:06.820 --> 48:14.540
That's my guess. I mean, I would imagine both the 720 and the PS4 would be Blu-ray.

48:14.540 --> 48:18.940
Right. Well, we're probably years off from both, but I think you're right. I think if

48:18.940 --> 48:22.460
they do talk to them about Blu-ray, I think it'll wait until the next Xbox system.

48:22.460 --> 48:28.140
We've got to let you go, Rasteel, because we've got to get some other calls, but thanks

48:28.140 --> 48:29.820
so much for your call. Have a good one.

48:29.820 --> 48:30.820
All right. Have a good one.

48:30.820 --> 48:31.820
Take care, buddy.

48:31.820 --> 48:32.820
Bye.

48:32.820 --> 48:38.740
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. That

48:38.740 --> 48:40.940
call was seven minutes. I tried to limit him to about four.

48:40.940 --> 48:42.820
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

48:42.820 --> 48:45.860
Yo, it's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest. How you doing?

48:45.860 --> 48:49.380
Xenocore from Ultimate Quest. How are things doing on the Ultimate Quest, Xenocore?

48:49.380 --> 48:54.940
Well, we've been sort of hectic considering we've been on and off on our weekends, mainly

48:54.940 --> 49:00.500
because I went to Megacon this last weekend up in Orlando. Yeah, doing a little bit of

49:00.500 --> 49:05.940
coverage here and there. My first one, actually, had just popped my contrary on Megacon.

49:05.940 --> 49:10.500
Check that out. What's the website again for folks who want to check out that?

49:10.500 --> 49:13.100
Well, for the convention or for our show?

49:13.100 --> 49:14.100
For the show.

49:14.100 --> 49:19.980
Oh, well, the show is at UltimateQuest.net. You may hear about something on it last week

49:19.980 --> 49:25.400
since I missed a recording. I didn't get back till late this evening. But, yeah, man, Megacon

49:25.400 --> 49:27.140
was something else, my goodness.

49:27.140 --> 49:29.740
Is that what you called in to talk about tonight was Megacon? What's up?

49:29.740 --> 49:34.180
Well, yeah, I mean, on top of that, they had the first Smash Brothers tournament I happened

49:34.180 --> 49:40.820
to catch, which is kind of interesting. But, yeah, the cosplayers, man, I wasn't ready

49:40.820 --> 49:42.700
for that level of dedication at all.

49:42.700 --> 49:47.660
Dude, there's some cosplayers that are so good at what they do. It is astounding. That's

49:47.660 --> 49:51.060
love right there. What were some of the cool cosplays you saw, Xenocore?

49:51.060 --> 49:57.140
Well, I got to mention this one that stood out for everything. A 14-year-old girl doing

49:57.140 --> 50:03.460
the Mighty Edward from Cowboy Bebop in character all three days. Laptop on her head the entire

50:03.460 --> 50:04.460
time.

50:04.460 --> 50:05.460
Wow.

50:05.460 --> 50:06.460
It was impressive. Yeah.

50:06.460 --> 50:09.580
I thought I was cool when I went as a black mage, even though I borrowed the costume from

50:09.580 --> 50:11.580
Rama.

50:11.580 --> 50:14.620
I got a question for you about role-playing games.

50:14.620 --> 50:15.620
Already?

50:15.620 --> 50:19.740
Have you played Lost Odyssey?

50:19.740 --> 50:24.940
We on our show did not. Henderson, man, actually spoke up for the show to review that one.

50:24.940 --> 50:26.660
I haven't grabbed it yet.

50:26.660 --> 50:30.740
I'm just kind of curious, because I know you guys kind of specialize in the role-playing

50:30.740 --> 50:34.260
games. I'm kind of curious, and maybe I'll have to wait until you guys take a few trips.

50:34.260 --> 50:37.980
I'm kind of curious of your general thoughts on the game, because the critics overall kind

50:37.980 --> 50:43.980
of dogged it a little bit, but I'm in love with it. I think it's a fantastic game.

50:43.980 --> 50:47.940
The main thing that caught my attention is something Henderson mentioned. You can't outlevel

50:47.940 --> 50:53.900
the bosses in Lost Odyssey. The bosses level according to what level you are, so the bosses

50:53.900 --> 50:54.900
are always different.

50:54.900 --> 50:57.260
Not really. No wonder there's such pains in the ass.

50:57.260 --> 50:59.940
Not really. They don't level, as far as I'm aware.

50:59.940 --> 51:00.940
They don't level?

51:00.940 --> 51:05.500
No, because there's actually some guides out there, the Prima guides and stuff, that tell

51:05.500 --> 51:09.500
you what level you should be at to play the boss. If you would have to grind a little

51:09.500 --> 51:11.860
bit, you can't just go from one boss to the next.

51:11.860 --> 51:16.660
Is it maybe because even though the bosses level up, you get more skills, so it makes

51:16.660 --> 51:21.500
it easier regardless? That could be my thought, is that maybe, yeah, the bosses are leveling

51:21.500 --> 51:26.180
up, but since you get more skills, you get power on them that way, if that makes sense.

51:26.180 --> 51:30.580
Because a large part of the game is skills.

51:30.580 --> 51:34.660
Everything I've gotten so far is based on Henderson Man's review.

51:34.660 --> 51:39.140
I will be playing it myself sooner or later as soon as the budget allows for it, but until

51:39.140 --> 51:41.460
then I can only go by word of mouth, pretty much.

51:41.460 --> 51:45.540
Well, I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Xenocore. I just had to ask, because it's

51:45.540 --> 51:49.900
been a large part of my gaming time lately. What else did you call in to talk about it?

51:49.900 --> 51:50.900
Anything else?

51:50.900 --> 51:54.600
Well, mainly it was just that, that I happened to come across my first con and decided to

51:54.600 --> 51:57.620
share it with some fellow con lovers.

51:57.620 --> 52:01.260
It's been a while since I've been to a con, but definitely we have Fandame coming up in

52:01.260 --> 52:05.100
May or June, right? When's Fandame? Is it Memorial Day weekend, Fandame?

52:05.100 --> 52:06.100
I think it is.

52:06.100 --> 52:08.780
Yeah, but I'm probably not going this year.

52:08.780 --> 52:16.220
Oh, is it the same time as your road trip? Oh. Oh. So, oh, well that's a bummer, because

52:16.220 --> 52:21.660
we always do our show there. But, let's see, well there's other cons coming up, and I still

52:21.660 --> 52:23.940
want to go to that one in Chicago, ASIN, is that it?

52:23.940 --> 52:25.660
I really want to go to ASIN.

52:25.660 --> 52:27.060
We'll see, we'll see.

52:27.060 --> 52:30.220
And I have information on that too, later.

52:30.220 --> 52:32.940
Okay. Later then. Later it is.

52:32.940 --> 52:35.860
Xenocore, anything else before I let you go?

52:35.860 --> 52:40.740
Just pretty much that, that and the largest Yuri Yowie argument I've ever heard in my

52:40.740 --> 52:41.740
entire life.

52:41.740 --> 52:42.740
No, jeez.

52:42.740 --> 52:44.480
Other than that, that was fine.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.180
Some things you can never escape, but cons.

52:46.180 --> 52:49.820
All right, let's go to YowieCon, the whole thing is an argument.

52:49.820 --> 52:54.260
All right, well Xenocore, thanks so much for your call, and have a good one, and good luck

52:54.260 --> 52:55.260
with your own show, all right?

52:55.260 --> 52:56.820
All right, take it easy, guys.

52:56.820 --> 52:58.720
You too, bye-bye.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.500
What exactly is the Yuri Yowie argument?

53:00.500 --> 53:02.620
Well, hold on, I'm going to ask our next caller.

53:02.620 --> 53:04.300
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio, who's this?

53:04.300 --> 53:07.300
Hey, I'm the family jam sessions, what's up?

53:07.300 --> 53:08.300
I don't care who it is.

53:08.300 --> 53:13.420
I want to ask you, DJ Rom S, I want to ask you, what is the Yuri Yowie argument?

53:13.420 --> 53:18.580
Oh, man.

53:18.580 --> 53:21.660
What exactly is the Yuri Yowie argument?

53:21.660 --> 53:26.680
You got these fangirls who argue about what's better, Yuri or Yowie.

53:26.680 --> 53:31.340
They run around with these paddles, they will start smacking you with them if you do not

53:31.340 --> 53:33.460
agree with them.

53:33.460 --> 53:39.500
This is true, that's why I said going to YowieCon is like a whole argument in and of itself.

53:39.500 --> 53:45.260
My friend, my other friend Jasmine, she has this priestess outfit, she walks around with

53:45.260 --> 53:50.540
an anti-Yowie paper fan that she smacks people with.

53:50.540 --> 53:55.300
That is nothing short of amazing, I don't know how else to describe it, but they yell

53:55.300 --> 53:59.100
at each other, this sounds like stupid fun, but they actually get upset over this.

53:59.100 --> 54:04.700
They really do think they're going to beat it into you to like Yowie.

54:04.700 --> 54:09.900
Some of them do, I mean a couple of years back at Animazement, we had this line of people

54:09.900 --> 54:15.420
on one side, you had the ninjas, you had on the other side the pirates, we were shouting

54:15.420 --> 54:19.180
back and forth, ninjas were better or pirates were better, got to the point where staff

54:19.180 --> 54:24.340
had to break us all up, and then maybe about an hour later, we started a conga line singing

54:24.340 --> 54:27.780
ninja rap all throughout the entire convention area.

54:27.780 --> 54:31.520
Cons are so weird.

54:31.520 --> 54:34.780
The funny thing about Anime Expo every year is that wherever they schedule it, they also

54:34.780 --> 54:40.460
schedule some sort of religious convention, so you get the people preaching to the cosplayers

54:40.460 --> 54:48.400
in line, and one year a bunch of us just started completely telling them off in various other

54:48.400 --> 54:51.920
languages that weren't necessarily Japanese.

54:51.920 --> 54:56.220
I know a lot of people that would pay a lot of money to see women beat each other up with

54:56.220 --> 54:57.220
battles.

54:57.220 --> 55:01.820
So you can get this all for free at your local anime convention?

55:01.820 --> 55:06.820
Pretty much, and Jamie, there is a voice actor, his name is Vic, he's like a born-again Christian,

55:06.820 --> 55:13.180
he's the voice of Ed from FMA, at Anime Conza, he has like a panel of Sunday morning service

55:13.180 --> 55:16.900
for con-goers to come and arrive for service.

55:16.900 --> 55:19.180
That's kinda cool.

55:19.180 --> 55:20.180
That's kinda neat.

55:20.180 --> 55:22.140
I've seen that happen at various conventions.

55:22.140 --> 55:24.580
For people that want to do that, why not?

55:24.580 --> 55:25.580
Why not?

55:25.580 --> 55:26.580
Definitely.

55:26.580 --> 55:33.300
Here's another quote that I love from RossioUT in chat, it says, this is different from console

55:33.300 --> 55:34.300
fanboys.

55:34.300 --> 55:35.300
How?

55:35.300 --> 55:36.300
Xbox!

55:36.300 --> 55:37.300
PlayStation!

55:37.300 --> 55:38.300
Xbox!

55:38.300 --> 55:39.300
PlayStation!

55:39.300 --> 55:40.300
Wii!

55:40.300 --> 55:45.540
I don't know about you guys, but I'd rather see a bunch of girls in cute outfits screaming

55:45.540 --> 55:50.460
yaoi vs yuri than a bunch of fanboys shouting what console is better, you know?

55:50.460 --> 55:52.260
I'd have to agree with you there.

55:52.260 --> 55:53.260
Yeah.

55:53.260 --> 55:57.100
Alright, Rama, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

55:57.100 --> 55:58.100
A couple of things.

55:58.100 --> 55:59.100
Yeah.

55:59.100 --> 56:02.960
The 360 with the missing autographs, if it was me, I would have bit the bullet and bought

56:02.960 --> 56:04.380
a new console.

56:04.380 --> 56:05.380
What?

56:05.380 --> 56:07.260
I would have done the same thing.

56:07.260 --> 56:10.340
Yeah, that's exactly what I would have done.

56:10.340 --> 56:14.740
But even, but they gave him back, the problem wasn't that he didn't have a working console,

56:14.740 --> 56:15.740
I don't get it.

56:15.740 --> 56:16.900
I wouldn't have left that to fate.

56:16.900 --> 56:21.300
I would not have put something that valuable in the hands of other people.

56:21.300 --> 56:22.300
I get it.

56:22.300 --> 56:23.300
I get it.

56:23.300 --> 56:25.500
So you would never have sent the console in to be repaired in the first place?

56:25.500 --> 56:26.500
Exactly.

56:26.500 --> 56:27.500
Okay, okay.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.500
That's fair.

56:29.500 --> 56:30.500
And Rob?

56:30.500 --> 56:31.500
Yep.

56:31.500 --> 56:34.540
I used to be a member of Prodigy as well.

56:34.540 --> 56:35.540
What was your username?

56:35.540 --> 56:37.500
Do you remember?

56:37.500 --> 56:41.180
I think it was Ronmecoon76 or something like that.

56:41.180 --> 56:42.180
That's not old school.

56:42.180 --> 56:43.180
That's not old school.

56:43.180 --> 56:45.900
You don't have the random letters and numbers?

56:45.900 --> 56:51.020
No, no, no, see, I got into Prodigy during the age of Windows and stuff like that.

56:51.020 --> 56:52.020
Oh, no, no, no, no.

56:52.020 --> 56:53.020
That's what I got on.

56:53.020 --> 56:54.020
Oh, no, no, no.

56:54.020 --> 56:55.020
I had Prodigy.

56:55.020 --> 56:56.020
You go way old school, yeah.

56:56.020 --> 57:01.100
I had DOS-based Prodigy, HWPD42B.

57:01.100 --> 57:05.620
I remember Radio Shack stores had Prodigy set up for people who were free to try out

57:05.620 --> 57:06.620
and stuff.

57:06.620 --> 57:07.620
Yep.

57:07.620 --> 57:09.660
That's how we found out about it the first time.

57:09.660 --> 57:12.780
And you know what happened to Prodigy, right?

57:12.780 --> 57:17.020
Then they get absolved into, basically they're like an ISP now, aren't they?

57:17.020 --> 57:19.660
Or they're a part of Yahoo, aren't they?

57:19.660 --> 57:20.660
Not really.

57:20.660 --> 57:23.160
They're like the red-headed bastard stepchild of AT&T.

57:23.160 --> 57:27.300
Like about one or two years ago, they were trying to sell off the name and everybody,

57:27.300 --> 57:30.380
the whole thing, to the highest bidder, and they're still trying to do that.

57:30.380 --> 57:34.180
Well, they got their asses handed to them by AOL, which is kind of sad because Prodigy

57:34.180 --> 57:38.580
was really rad for a couple of years when they were the only ones that had that DOS

57:38.580 --> 57:39.580
thing.

57:39.580 --> 57:40.580
That was awesome.

57:40.580 --> 57:41.580
That's awesome.

57:41.580 --> 57:42.580
Yeah.

57:42.580 --> 57:43.580
That's awesome.

57:43.580 --> 57:45.180
All right, DJ Romans, we got to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

57:45.180 --> 57:46.180
It's fun as always.

57:46.180 --> 57:47.180
One more thing.

57:47.180 --> 57:48.180
One more thing.

57:48.180 --> 57:49.180
I promise I'm not here.

57:49.180 --> 57:50.180
Hurry.

57:50.180 --> 57:51.940
You'll never guess what my first game console was.

57:51.940 --> 57:52.940
What?

57:52.940 --> 57:55.260
ColecoVision Adam.

57:55.260 --> 57:57.780
Which is ironic if people know you very well.

57:57.780 --> 57:58.780
Mm-hmm.

57:58.780 --> 58:01.820
I'll see you guys later.

58:01.820 --> 58:02.820
Take care, Rama.

58:02.820 --> 58:03.820
All right.

58:03.820 --> 58:04.820
Bye.

58:04.820 --> 58:05.820
Or should I say ColecoVision?

58:05.820 --> 58:06.820
All right.

58:06.820 --> 58:07.820
ColecoMan!

58:07.820 --> 58:11.820
If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call.

58:11.820 --> 58:12.820
Maristia2877 specialize.

58:12.820 --> 58:13.820
My name's Maristia2877.

58:13.820 --> 58:14.820
Our user name on Skype is OrangeloungeRadio.

58:14.820 --> 58:21.140
Meanwhile, I did actually get a last-minute news story from somebody.

58:21.140 --> 58:23.460
Where is it?

58:23.460 --> 58:24.480
Here it is.

58:24.480 --> 58:29.460
Is the video game industry recession-proof, a story that was run on MSN?

58:29.460 --> 58:34.700
Video game companies think that they might be able to survive the slowing down of the

58:34.700 --> 58:35.700
economy.

58:35.700 --> 58:43.260
Apparently, video games have defied the sagging retail sales figures of December 2007.

58:43.260 --> 58:47.620
Nintendo actually talked to CNBC, specifically Reggie Fils-Aime, said that his company in

58:47.620 --> 58:52.140
particular was weathering the coming storm and that video games seem to do well in tougher

58:52.140 --> 58:53.140
economic times.

58:53.140 --> 58:56.260
Well, come on, if you're a Nintendo Wii right now, you're one of the few people that's doing

58:56.260 --> 58:58.700
very well, right?

58:58.700 --> 59:01.940
It's interesting, his MSNBC story kind of gets into talking about the history and all

59:01.940 --> 59:05.260
this other stuff as well, so check that out if you want to.

59:05.260 --> 59:06.260
Meantime, we have another call.

59:06.260 --> 59:10.220
I was going to say I have a couple of last-minute stories after this.

59:10.220 --> 59:11.340
We'll get to those right after this call.

59:11.340 --> 59:13.260
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio, who's this?

59:13.260 --> 59:15.780
Hi, this is Ospurr.

59:15.780 --> 59:17.260
Ospurr, what's on your mind?

59:17.260 --> 59:19.500
I always horribly mispronounce your name, apparently.

59:19.500 --> 59:24.260
I always say Ospurr like I'm drunk talking to the policeman, but it's Ospurr.

59:24.260 --> 59:25.580
It's Ospurr, so my bad.

59:25.580 --> 59:27.220
So what's on your mind, Ospurr?

59:27.220 --> 59:29.100
That's all right.

59:29.100 --> 59:33.860
It's just pretty interesting with the whole yaoi-yuri argument, and I'm actually going

59:33.860 --> 59:38.460
to be going to my first convention in May, so I'll be sure to look out for that.

59:38.460 --> 59:42.260
You know what, yeah, just avoid the women that have the yaoi-yuri paddles unless you're

59:42.260 --> 59:43.260
into that.

59:43.260 --> 59:44.260
Watch out for the free hugs.

59:44.260 --> 59:45.260
You don't know if they've been tested.

59:45.260 --> 59:50.980
Yeah, if somebody's wearing a glomp sign, run the other way.

59:50.980 --> 59:54.380
I want to experience full on, so I'm actually going to go run towards them for the heck

59:54.380 --> 59:55.380
of it.

59:55.380 --> 59:57.620
Okay, don't say we didn't warn you, bud.

59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.420
Rama wants to know what con it is.

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.020
I think it's Anime Central.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.020
It's in Illinois.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.020
That's ASEN.

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.260
That's the one that we're wanting to go to.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.020
Yeah, we're thinking about going.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.340
That's a big one.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.740
Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.740
Yeah.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.740
We'll see.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.740
I don't know.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.740
It's probably too late to get a panel on that and all that stuff.

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.740
We'll see.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.740
Not necessarily.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.740
Hmm.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740
Maybe we might have to make that happen.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:22.180
If not, we could always do the OLR hospitality suite or something silly.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.180
I don't know.

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.180
We'll think of something.

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.180
Yeah.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.940
Yeah, we're still plotting.

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.940
I don't know.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.180
If it doesn't happen this year, then for sure next year, because we definitely want to make

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.180
ASEN a goal of ours.

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.700
We know we have a lot of folks in the Midwest that want to meet us, and I want to meet them.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.700
So we'll see.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.700
We'll see.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.700
Well, good luck at that con.

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:43.300
Anything else you wanted to talk to us about tonight?

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.180
Just been playing lots of Brawl.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.180
What are your thoughts on Brawl?

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.180
Did they get it right?

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.180
Was it worth the wait?

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:55.640
Yeah, I'd say it's definitely worth the wait, but really my only frustration is with the

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.640
online play.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.060
So I just can't freaking connect and play against anyone.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.780
Is your Wii far away from your Wi-Fi router?

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:08.180
No, it's only like 10 feet away from it.

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.180
Oh, weird.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.220
You know, I did play online.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.540
I haven't gotten the friends thing to work.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.220
I'm going to try tonight after the show.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:20.180
But I have heard, or I did play the random people one, which is a little silly because

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.940
it's just like playing the computer pretty much, except you know somebody real is controlling

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:24.940
it.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:25.940
But it wasn't bad.

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:28.860
It was relatively lag-free, so I was pretty excited.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:35.940
Oh yeah, I just kept on getting error codes and it would just cut me out saying the transmission

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.340
has ended or something like that.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.960
I was just like, what the heck?

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.940
But I haven't actually tried doing it through friend codes, so I don't know, maybe that'll

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.940
work better.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:43.940
Who knows?

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.180
All right, well anything else on your mind tonight, Ospher?

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.820
No, that's about it.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.700
All right, well thanks so much for the phone call.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:56.100
You have a good week, and try to take that Smash Brothers in limitation.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.500
Don't OD on it, okay?

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.500
Yeah.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.500
Okay.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.500
Take care, buddy.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.500
All right, see ya.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.500
All right.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.060
That's going to do it for tonight's Skypline.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.140
Thank you guys so much for your calls, and if you didn't get through tonight, don't worry,

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.260
there's always next week.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.300
Or you can always leave us a voicemail.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.300
We do play the voicemails once in a while.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.260
I know we didn't play them tonight, but we'll probably get to some more next week.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.580
1-877-GAME-OLR whenever we're not live.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.780
So you said you had some last minute stories, Lucky?

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.780
Yes, real quick here.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.020
There's two things.

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:31.620
At show Dexter, you may have heard about, they're actually now starting to replay it

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:40.660
on CVS, but it's about a serial killer who, instead of going around killing other people,

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.820
he goes around killing serial killers.

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.260
So they kind of fight his urge.

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:49.640
It's currently running Showtime, and apparently they're making a game from it.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.780
So that's kind of interesting.

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:54.820
The other thing is the game Turning Point.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:03:01.220
Apparently the reviews haven't been too good for it, and according to Turning Point's CEO

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:08.420
of the company Spark Unlimited, he's quoted that Turning Point is too high concept for

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.460
reviewers.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.920
It wasn't for the critics, apparently.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:23.380
It was more, I guess, a game that was never meant for core gamers, or is meant for those

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:28.360
who aren't wanting to look at a game with a critical eye, I guess.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:34.360
So he's basically saying that the game reviewers don't know how to review his game, because

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.160
it was supposed to be crappy, I guess.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.160
I don't know.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.660
All right.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:45.680
I know his next game that they're doing, was it Legendary?

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.420
That one that's by Gamecock, I guess?

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.420
Legendary the Box?

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:52.420
But now it's just Legendary.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.220
Who knows?

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.420
All right.

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.760
Well that is going to do it, I guess, for tonight's Last Minute Stories.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.760
That's it for now.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760
All right.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.940
So that's going to bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.380
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting independent radio.

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.440
You guys are awesome.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.060
I want to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts, and then actually we're breaking

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.060
form a little bit tonight.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.540
I have one more story that's very important that we want to do at the very, very end.

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.820
We're going to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts, Loki.

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:29.700
My final thought is I want to finish Space Emissary Mode this week, and god damn it,

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:35.140
I wish my 360, the other one I'm fixing, fucking works, because it's three-ringed and been

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.740
fixed and three-ringed and sort of been fixed for weeks now.

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:43.700
Now it's three-ringed right now, so I have to heat it up again, and I think it's just

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.700
broken.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.500
But I've done so many mods to it that I kind of want it to be fixed, because it'll look

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.300
like a Frankenstein's monster when I'm done.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:53.540
This is a long-ass final thought.

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.300
It's a final muse.

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:56.740
It's a final rant.

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.180
I'm just messing with you, Loki.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:00.980
This show just wouldn't be the same without you.

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.700
You know it.

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.720
My final thought is I cannot wait for Wii Fit.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.720
I really can't.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.540
I think it's going to be very interesting.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.280
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.260
Say no to bullshit.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.260
Really good final thought.

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.200
Appreciate that.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.760
We are going to close tonight on this, and I hate to end the show on such a downer, but

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:25.580
it is very important to acknowledge, and I'm sure if you have an internet connection, you've

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:30.200
heard about it this week, we have to acknowledge the passing of Gary Gygax, which happened

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.560
this week.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.940
You might not know the name, but you definitely know the legacy he left behind.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:39.980
He was the co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons and TSR, and let's face it, without Dungeons

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:43.600
& Dragons, you would not have role-playing games like you have today.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.800
Think about all the games that were inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.360
I'm talking about everything from old school games like Ultima and the actual Dungeons

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:58.680
& Dragons games that were on the Apple IIe and all that, and to everything that we have

01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.680
new today.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.320
The Final Fantasies of the World, the Warcrafts, and if you've actually played D&D, there actually

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:10.040
are a lot of similarities between a huge game like World of Warcraft and this.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.440
Unfortunately, he did pass away this week at the age of 69.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:19.440
We do want to acknowledge the importance that this man had on the gaming industry, and certainly

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.360
we not only want to dedicate everything we've done tonight to his memory, but we thought

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.480
we'd close a little bit, again kind of breaking for him a little bit.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:31.820
We thought we'd close tonight with a song, because moments of silence are kind of awkward

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:37.300
on podcasts, so we thought we'd instead play a song, and this song is from a game that

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:41.600
was definitely, you could say, directly inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.440
It's the theme to Neverwinter Nights, and while we play this song, just maybe tip your

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:51.680
hat, bow your head, say some final words for Gary Gygax, the creator of Dungeons & Dragons

01:06:51.680 --> 01:07:17.360
who passed this week at the age of 69.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:48.360
Gary Gygax, the creator of Dungeons & Dragons who passed this week at the age of 69.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:09:02.080
We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.080
