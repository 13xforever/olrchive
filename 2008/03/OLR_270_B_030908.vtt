00:00.885 --> 00:01.345
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio

00:23.607 --> 00:29.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than Steam, you can now buy the, or soon, you will be able to buy the components of the Orange Box separately.

00:30.592 --> 00:33.193
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be hitting retail stores on April 9th.

00:33.894 --> 00:38.437
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to buy Portal for $19.99 and then, of course, Half-Life 2 Episode 1 and 2 for $29.99 and Team Fortress 2 for $29.99.

00:38.477 --> 00:40.538
[SPEAKER_03]: All sold separately now.

00:40.558 --> 00:41.119
[SPEAKER_03]: So, awesome.

00:41.139 --> 00:42.700
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

00:52.725 --> 00:54.987
[SPEAKER_03]: Half-Life 2, I don't think, was that expensive to begin with.

00:55.287 --> 00:56.748
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you might as well just buy them all.

00:57.349 --> 01:07.256
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a really good way for people who haven't seen Portal yet to get it, because I know people that would consider that $60 for Portal was a decent buy, and you got all these other cool games free.

01:07.657 --> 01:15.423
[SPEAKER_06]: So, honestly, this is an excellent... I mean, not to knock the other games, because the Orange Box is a great combo package, but certainly there's a lot of people that want to see Portal by itself.

01:15.503 --> 01:21.988
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you've owned... if you already owned, like, Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, although if you buy the Episode Pack, you're getting one all over again, so...

01:22.975 --> 01:23.776
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:24.056 --> 01:25.036
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, go ahead.

01:25.096 --> 01:28.018
[SPEAKER_10]: That whole bunch of Half-Life is just epic.

01:29.099 --> 01:29.819
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very epic.

01:30.680 --> 01:37.944
[SPEAKER_06]: I never realized you were quite the Half-Life fan, DarkSakura, but during our bonus segment tonight, which only the live listeners heard, you're quite a Half-Life fan.

01:37.964 --> 01:38.525
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize.

01:38.885 --> 01:43.588
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, keep in mind, I can't really play them because I get bad motion sickness when I play them.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.389
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean you don't recognize a good game when you see one.

01:45.569 --> 01:46.029
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, right.

01:46.209 --> 01:48.591
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love the story for Half-Life, too.

01:48.611 --> 01:50.372
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Half-Life was sort of like...

01:51.352 --> 01:53.913
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you crawl through some pipes and you kill some aliens.

01:54.374 --> 01:59.436
[SPEAKER_10]: But I thought that Half-Life 2 had a very, actually a really involved story.

01:59.476 --> 02:00.477
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was very good.

02:01.637 --> 02:02.218
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very rad.

02:02.258 --> 02:08.361
[SPEAKER_10]: I was basically loading up everything on my iPhone and listening to it on YouTube at my desk at work.

02:08.881 --> 02:12.383
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Steel UT has some advice, and I'm kind of curious if it actually would work or not.

02:12.503 --> 02:13.764
[SPEAKER_06]: He says play on a smaller screen.

02:13.944 --> 02:14.384
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that help?

02:14.444 --> 02:14.524
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:15.188 --> 02:15.308
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

02:15.488 --> 02:15.948
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

02:16.068 --> 02:19.529
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually has gotten a little bit better since we started playing on the widescreen.

02:19.889 --> 02:20.109
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

02:20.169 --> 02:26.091
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I have a 50-inch widescreen TV, and it was a lot worse on our old CRT, which was smaller.

02:26.691 --> 02:27.051
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

02:27.151 --> 02:29.712
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of get the logic behind what he's suggesting, though.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.352
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of weird that it's the reverse.

02:31.392 --> 02:33.132
[SPEAKER_10]: The flatter the screen, the less sick I get.

02:34.013 --> 02:34.553
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

02:35.113 --> 02:40.354
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also get less eye strain on my old Trinitron versus my old CRT screen.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.354
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the eye strain might be...

02:44.318 --> 02:44.739
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

02:44.879 --> 02:47.764
[SPEAKER_10]: But it still is bad, no matter what, it still is bad.

02:47.824 --> 02:50.809
[SPEAKER_10]: However, nothing makes me as freaking motion sick as GoldenEye64 did.

02:51.911 --> 02:52.212
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:53.203 --> 02:54.384
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyhow, moving on.

02:54.424 --> 03:00.789
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of splitting up, Ziff Davis Media owns a lot of stuff, and after this, they might have to split some of it off.

03:01.209 --> 03:02.090
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

03:02.150 --> 03:10.676
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not here yelling doom and gloom, but certainly that's what a lot of people are speculating after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week.

03:10.716 --> 03:11.017
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

03:11.077 --> 03:13.499
[SPEAKER_06]: Ziff Davis filed for bankruptcy earlier this week.

03:14.179 --> 03:17.822
[SPEAKER_06]: They had $390 million in debt since last August.

03:18.963 --> 03:21.805
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if this bankruptcy is actually approved by the bankruptcy courts...

03:22.265 --> 03:22.585
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

03:43.189 --> 03:46.711
[SPEAKER_06]: They are saying that all the video game stuff, it should be business as usual.

03:47.932 --> 03:59.899
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason Young, who is the CEO of Ziff Davis, has this quote, quote, Today's restructuring agreement goes a long way towards resolving the burdens of a debt load and capital structure established seven years ago during a leveraged buyout of the company.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.400
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's Chapter 11, right?

04:01.720 --> 04:01.900
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

04:02.401 --> 04:03.601
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

04:05.983 --> 04:12.267
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, Chapter 11 is just strictly for businesses only, because we actually, at my work, we occasionally get a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in for...

04:13.188 --> 04:15.830
[SPEAKER_10]: for multifamily homes, basically apartments, condos, that type of thing.

04:17.392 --> 04:22.596
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is basically done for the purpose of paying back and restructuring their debt.

04:23.256 --> 04:25.558
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to give the company a chance to make a fresh start.

04:26.859 --> 04:27.160
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.621
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see what happens.

04:30.002 --> 04:33.765
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, people are screaming doom and gloom, and our chat room is no different.

04:33.825 --> 04:36.247
[SPEAKER_06]: PKJr92 says, does this mean 1UP will die?

04:37.268 --> 04:37.568
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

04:37.648 --> 04:38.009
[SPEAKER_06]: Doubt it.

04:38.249 --> 04:39.930
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's one of their more successful properties, right?

04:41.621 --> 04:42.441
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill something.

04:43.002 --> 04:47.364
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the bad thing about Chapter 11 is that it's actually really bad for their stockholders.

04:48.064 --> 04:48.344
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

04:48.384 --> 04:55.987
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if their debts exceed their assets, then when the bankruptcy is done, all of their rights and interests are terminated.

04:57.028 --> 05:02.070
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, all the creditors have a new business to start with, nothing on the books.

05:02.710 --> 05:06.092
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says, if Davis going bankrupt could mean the end of digital life.

05:07.472 --> 05:11.194
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that because they were a major sponsor, but I don't know.

05:13.527 --> 05:13.907
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

05:15.448 --> 05:18.189
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's too bad, though, for them, I guess.

05:19.050 --> 05:19.290
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

05:20.210 --> 05:21.411
[SPEAKER_10]: Sucks to be stockholders first.

05:21.431 --> 05:25.493
[SPEAKER_06]: Business sucks sometimes, so hopefully this will be a nice fresh start for them.

05:26.073 --> 05:30.975
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you can usually tell if there's rumors going out about a company going under when people start selling off their stock.

05:31.535 --> 05:31.796
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

05:34.197 --> 05:34.437
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

05:34.457 --> 05:34.917
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I got.

05:35.709 --> 05:38.811
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how about something that's just a little bit happier, huh?

05:39.191 --> 05:39.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

05:39.891 --> 05:40.892
[SPEAKER_10]: Midway!

05:41.432 --> 05:42.533
[SPEAKER_10]: We like Midway.

05:42.893 --> 05:45.474
[SPEAKER_10]: Except Midway's been losing some money, too.

05:47.495 --> 05:53.979
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, more around the amount of $97.4 million last financial year.

05:54.519 --> 06:02.323
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're trying to cater more towards the casual gamer by having an online portal for

06:03.339 --> 06:05.040
[SPEAKER_10]: and a lot of those games that are out.

06:05.120 --> 06:09.424
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, basically, it's just... Well, I just completely lost my train of thought.

06:10.345 --> 06:10.965
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.348
[SPEAKER_06]: Midway owns the rights to a lot of classic franchises though, right?

06:15.148 --> 06:15.889
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

06:16.149 --> 06:20.593
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Midway... It was... Wasn't it Midway that brought us out like Mortal Kombat?

06:20.833 --> 06:21.053
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

06:21.293 --> 06:28.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I'm going even further back than that because I'm thinking about those like classic packs with like Robotron and Joust and you know, all that.

06:29.399 --> 06:31.021
[SPEAKER_06]: They've rehashed that stuff a thousand times.

06:31.061 --> 06:32.502
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if this is kind of a part of

06:33.001 --> 06:35.463
[SPEAKER_06]: How they're going to launch a more casual games portal.

06:35.823 --> 06:44.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, because, you know, I can think of casual games as old school games that were very simple, or I can think of them as, you know, pop cap type casual games, like Bejeweled and stuff.

06:45.630 --> 06:47.911
[SPEAKER_06]: That, again, you know, very easy to pick up and play type games.

06:47.931 --> 06:53.275
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go in probably with the older games, and say like the re-release that shit over and over and over and over and over again.

06:54.156 --> 07:00.060
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, basically, they're only saying that two titles have been out that's used any of the different type of...

07:01.207 --> 07:01.708
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com.

07:25.906 --> 07:26.206
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

07:26.486 --> 07:44.401
[SPEAKER_06]: I heart classic games though and if the portal is built good where it does online high score boards and maybe some achievement point type thing and some clever new little innovative things that make it stand out, I would probably check it out.

07:44.922 --> 07:51.928
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we're coming up on the 10th anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast and

07:52.455 --> 07:59.198
[SPEAKER_03]: To commemorate that, Sega of Japan has updated their Dreamcast.com website with a question.

07:59.739 --> 08:01.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still own a Dreamcast?

08:02.180 --> 08:02.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

08:02.820 --> 08:16.527
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do, what you can do is submit your serial number, and they will basically register an account with you with user.dreamcast.com, and you'll get an email, which is your serial number at dreamcast.com.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.962
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is that going to do for me?

08:27.436 --> 08:28.797
[SPEAKER_06]: I could register both of mine.

08:28.817 --> 08:30.458
[SPEAKER_06]: There's hardcore Sega people out there.

08:30.538 --> 08:32.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Hard fucking core Sega people out there.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.841
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie's kind of borderline one of them, I think.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.122
[SPEAKER_10]: I have two Dreamcasts.

08:36.182 --> 08:40.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I should register mine so I can have another spam email address.

08:40.324 --> 08:40.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

08:40.784 --> 08:41.265
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be fun.

08:41.565 --> 08:42.105
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird, though.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.346
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have your serial number.

08:43.646 --> 08:49.410
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it almost makes me wonder, like, wow, could they release an email program for the Dreamcast or something really weird all these years later?

08:49.830 --> 08:52.031
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the Dreamcast came out, what, 9-9-99?

08:52.051 --> 08:53.592
[SPEAKER_06]: But I imagine it was a little bit before that in Japan.

08:53.652 --> 08:54.393
[SPEAKER_06]: We're bringing it back.

08:54.853 --> 08:59.177
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that I got my other one in, I want to say April?

09:00.058 --> 09:01.599
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was probably a few months earlier in Japan.

09:01.639 --> 09:03.441
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because I had my Dreamcast way early.

09:04.402 --> 09:05.082
[SPEAKER_03]: Why couldn't they?

09:05.182 --> 09:06.844
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that would be kind of cool to bring it back.

09:06.884 --> 09:11.948
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, you know, make it all open source type stuff.

09:11.988 --> 09:12.489
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

09:12.989 --> 09:17.053
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they already have a pretty big open source community for homebrew stuff, but...

09:17.765 --> 09:22.389
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, a lot of these portable game systems, even like the DS and stuff, aren't that powerful.

09:22.449 --> 09:28.635
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could probably do a lot on the Dreamcast that you could do on those systems, so... Why not?

09:30.257 --> 09:32.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see what happens, see what this develops into.

09:32.979 --> 09:35.641
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we haven't heard the last of the Dreamcast.

09:35.702 --> 09:41.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's something, I mean, obviously we don't expect a lot, but even something little, I think them putting out some type of, like...

09:42.048 --> 09:42.648
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:05.387 --> 10:09.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, technology has come a long way since the days of the Dreamcast.

10:09.669 --> 10:12.730
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, now we have the Xbox 360, which are on live and all that stuff.

10:12.810 --> 10:19.232
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you know it, it didn't take too long before we have yet another story coming from a CBS news station.

10:19.653 --> 10:27.996
[SPEAKER_06]: WCBS-TV in New York is reporting, and this is the headline, alarming trend, online video game predators.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.201
[SPEAKER_06]: The Predator's Story

10:50.822 --> 10:51.242
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

10:51.262 --> 11:03.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's what happened is that, according to the story, apparently things were going fine, and then this guy crashed into somebody, and the webcam picture came back, and it was a butt.

11:04.812 --> 11:07.233
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody put their butt on the webcam.

11:07.273 --> 11:16.039
[SPEAKER_06]: But it actually, I don't know, it gets a little sick, because Najee's father, whose name is Charles Johnson, said that the image showed a lot more than just a butt.

11:16.379 --> 11:20.042
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a picture of the guy mooning the camera, and you could actually see his genitals.

11:21.223 --> 11:21.744
[SPEAKER_06]: Gross!

11:22.484 --> 11:23.785
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you send that picture over?

11:23.806 --> 11:31.513
[SPEAKER_03]: That takes talent, too, because the camera takes the picture pretty quick, so you'd have to crash your car in, like, I don't know.

11:31.573 --> 11:34.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you'd have to have your friend standing there, waiting to go.

11:35.677 --> 11:36.298
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go, yeah.

11:37.173 --> 11:38.215
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

11:52.333 --> 11:56.976
[SPEAKER_06]: And as sensationalist as the story is, it does make some decent points.

11:57.837 --> 12:04.981
[SPEAKER_06]: The father said that he thought it would be fine to play because the game is rated E for everyone, or E10+, or whatever.

12:05.301 --> 12:07.423
[SPEAKER_06]: However, of course, the ESRB does have that warning.

12:07.543 --> 12:09.944
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the beginning of the fucking game.

12:10.425 --> 12:13.106
[SPEAKER_03]: For a second there, and you have to hit a button to go past it.

12:13.306 --> 12:13.527
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.868
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, I understand that, but at the same time,

12:18.049 --> 12:19.912
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, what fucking moron did this?

12:20.332 --> 12:29.004
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to show your butt to your friends is one thing, but to show it to complete strangers when it might be 12-year-old kids playing the game, it's kind of messed up.

12:30.249 --> 12:35.811
[SPEAKER_06]: and causes things like this to happen where now the media runs with it and talks about sexual predators.

12:36.711 --> 12:38.052
[SPEAKER_06]: They were probably high.

12:38.172 --> 12:39.592
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're sexual predators.

12:39.632 --> 12:41.153
[SPEAKER_06]: They're probably drug users.

12:41.613 --> 12:42.573
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that that makes it right.

12:42.593 --> 12:44.374
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because media has nothing to talk about.

12:44.554 --> 12:45.794
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a perfect example.

12:45.834 --> 12:52.916
[SPEAKER_03]: We were watching the local news yesterday and they were talking about a fire that happened in North Carolina.

12:53.196 --> 12:54.737
[SPEAKER_03]: We live in California.

12:55.357 --> 13:00.799
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how fucking slow is the news if you're talking about a building fire in another state?

13:02.399 --> 13:06.421
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then they proceed to show a, what was it, a chicken sledding.

13:06.821 --> 13:09.002
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how slow the news was.

13:09.102 --> 13:13.063
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they run with this crap, because they can spin it, and it's an interesting story.

13:13.103 --> 13:18.665
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll put some, not really put asses in seats, but you know what I mean, tunes people in.

13:19.685 --> 13:23.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob with two Bs pours a little salt in the wound, says California has enough of its own fires.

13:24.127 --> 13:24.227
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

13:25.444 --> 13:26.324
[SPEAKER_03]: Not right now, they don't.

13:26.525 --> 13:27.985
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in between Fire Seas.

13:28.826 --> 13:33.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Pendro in chat says this, you should be able to rate people as you play them, like feedback on eBay or something.

13:33.488 --> 13:35.789
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the 360 has a system kind of like that.

13:36.109 --> 13:37.029
[SPEAKER_06]: But what about PS3?

13:37.670 --> 13:38.150
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

13:38.170 --> 13:39.911
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe.

13:43.492 --> 13:47.294
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there needs to be a way where something can be done a little more immediately.

13:47.614 --> 13:51.536
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know on Xbox 360, they swear up and down, they do review that stuff.

13:51.886 --> 13:52.187
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.791
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you have to pay people.

14:00.808 --> 14:03.210
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, dude, it's a person's ass.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like you're scarred for fucking life.

14:05.892 --> 14:07.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but I kind of see it.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.254
[SPEAKER_06]: That is kind of nasty.

14:09.294 --> 14:15.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you're a 12-year-old kid, because they're saying it's not just his butt, but I guess the whole naughty bits were dangling there, too.

14:15.799 --> 14:16.460
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm so sorry.

14:18.981 --> 14:23.084
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, tomorrow they're going to go out and murder people because they've been severely scarred.

14:23.425 --> 14:23.805
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

14:23.825 --> 14:28.969
[SPEAKER_03]: You better watch your kids now because now they're going to go on a murderous rage and go and rape and pillage and fucking...

14:29.569 --> 14:31.911
[SPEAKER_03]: The world is over for you and your family.

14:32.291 --> 14:35.072
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well, you know, leave the country.

14:35.132 --> 14:39.655
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

14:39.715 --> 14:42.997
[SPEAKER_06]: He also says you're overreacting.

14:44.858 --> 14:46.439
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you're awfully quiet.

14:46.479 --> 14:47.319
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on this?

14:48.340 --> 14:51.702
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a butt, and it's, you know, dingley bits, I guess.

14:53.590 --> 15:00.155
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're saying, you know what, maybe we should just stop being so freaking sensitive to... I really think that's it.

15:00.175 --> 15:04.238
[SPEAKER_10]: If people didn't make a big deal out of this crap, then it wouldn't, you know, be such an issue.

15:05.279 --> 15:05.579
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

15:05.879 --> 15:09.582
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you have some feedback, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.

15:09.602 --> 15:18.669
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, you know what, thinking about that this guy was so stupid to do this to strangers kind of pisses me off and makes me a little bit angsty that this guy was such a moron.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.231
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's time to have the FUs of the week.

15:36.977 --> 15:41.940
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I have a few FUs to compile.

15:41.960 --> 15:48.925
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, my first one goes, of course, to Daylight Savings Time, because I went to bed at 4.30am, and of course woke up at 1.30am.

15:48.945 --> 15:48.985
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

15:51.957 --> 15:59.319
[SPEAKER_10]: My next one goes towards the guy who was driving the red pickup truck, which, by the way, was a Ford, and Ford stands for Fix Off and Repair Daily.

15:59.799 --> 16:10.362
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I was in the left lane, and he was in the right lane, and then he just cut out in front of me, like, literally, with inches to spare, to get into the turning lane on the left side of me.

16:10.722 --> 16:13.082
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, dude, where'd you learn how to drive?

16:13.282 --> 16:16.763
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, oh, I'm sorry, you did learn how to drive, if you're driving like that.

16:17.423 --> 16:19.064
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate stupid people who drive.

16:19.564 --> 16:19.644
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

16:20.658 --> 16:30.081
[SPEAKER_10]: and also another F you goes to my cat for throwing up in an inappropriate place.

16:31.381 --> 16:31.942
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

16:32.082 --> 16:34.162
[SPEAKER_10]: Although she's a cute baby and I forgive her.

16:34.923 --> 16:35.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

16:36.183 --> 16:48.407
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to this guy named Michael T something or I don't remember his last name but apparently I knew enough because we sat there at dinner on Saturday no, Friday, I'm sorry

16:49.191 --> 16:54.557
[SPEAKER_03]: and this guy went on and on and on and on about his fucking life next to us.

16:54.717 --> 16:57.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently this couple was on their first date or whatever.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.623
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel sorry for the woman because this guy just went on and on.

17:01.083 --> 17:05.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one time I had a felony, but they cleared it, so it's all good now.

17:05.868 --> 17:11.494
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I took in my truck because I'm a... What was it?

17:11.534 --> 17:12.855
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a plumbing inspector.

17:13.582 --> 17:42.815
[SPEAKER_03]: and I took in my truck one time and they gave me a loaner car and it was an undercover cop car and so I drove through the ghetto and everyone was like oh my god it's the cops went on and on for two hours and he was still talking the entire time I don't think the woman got a word in so sucks for don't meet people on MySpace this is what happens alright my FUs of the week go to also Daylight Savings Time I think it's horrible and you know losing sleep sucks I hate that

17:43.659 --> 17:46.820
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, gosh, I can't really think of a lot else.

17:47.341 --> 17:49.802
[SPEAKER_06]: I think just Daylight Saving Time makes up the bulk of my FUs this week.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.282
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's unnecessary.

17:51.582 --> 17:52.723
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a necessary FU.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when you lose sleep, there's never a good thing to come out of that.

17:56.104 --> 17:58.145
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you have it.

17:59.825 --> 18:00.626
[SPEAKER_06]: Our FUs of the week.

18:02.186 --> 18:03.607
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to point this out real quick.

18:03.787 --> 18:08.449
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin is in our JustinTV chat and says that the whole Dreamcast thing

18:08.960 --> 18:15.162
[SPEAKER_06]: It says this is a scam, and gives me a link to the NeoGAF forums that isn't loading for me right now.

18:15.202 --> 18:21.143
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm timing out, so I can't read you the full text of what it says, but apparently that Dreamcast thing may not be legitimate.

18:21.744 --> 18:22.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, who cares?

18:22.384 --> 18:22.964
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care.

18:24.064 --> 18:24.804
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking Dreamcast.

18:24.824 --> 18:26.285
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they going to do with my serial number?

18:27.105 --> 18:27.845
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

18:27.885 --> 18:29.046
[SPEAKER_06]: What can they do with the serial number?

18:29.666 --> 18:30.786
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides maybe send spam.

18:30.806 --> 18:31.866
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to give me your email address?

18:33.107 --> 18:33.487
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

18:33.627 --> 18:37.908
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't signed up the site's down, so... Oh, maybe it got taken down for being a big scam!

18:38.417 --> 18:40.279
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's an error thing.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.621
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just too many people trying to access it at one time.

18:45.144 --> 18:45.464
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

18:48.267 --> 18:51.930
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go ahead and get back into some gaming news.

18:52.731 --> 18:55.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, no, we're going to go and actually check out the mailbag.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.043
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:25.799 --> 19:29.942
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, we are going to open up the mailbag because we did get at least a couple emails, right?

19:30.523 --> 19:30.943
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.685
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's enough for us to open up the mailbag and jump on in.

19:33.725 --> 19:35.406
[SPEAKER_06]: So fill up the mailbag.

19:35.446 --> 19:37.028
[SPEAKER_06]: Give Jamie a lot of work to do next week.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.729
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLingerie.com.

19:38.769 --> 19:39.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

19:46.075 --> 19:53.620
[SPEAKER_10]: The first email of the week is actually from Cheeseburger asking us to play the intro to Castlevania 64.

19:53.680 --> 19:53.740
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

19:57.922 --> 19:59.843
[SPEAKER_06]: Make me play the intro from a good game and we'll do it.

20:00.323 --> 20:00.843
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha.

20:01.863 --> 20:03.744
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he actually emailed us.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.204
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, no, I take that back.

20:05.224 --> 20:06.925
[SPEAKER_10]: That wasn't from Cheeseburger.

20:06.965 --> 20:10.946
[SPEAKER_10]: It was from... God, now I have to go in that folder to find out who it was.

20:11.526 --> 20:14.627
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he emailed something else, but I can't read half of it on the air.

20:15.807 --> 20:16.207
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

20:16.547 --> 20:20.848
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it involves finding a broken DS and using their serial number to replace it.

20:21.049 --> 20:22.529
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're not going to do that.

20:22.749 --> 20:24.249
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, snap.

20:24.469 --> 20:25.710
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to do that.

20:25.810 --> 20:26.290
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

20:27.228 --> 20:29.789
[SPEAKER_06]: Not after the debates we've been in the past couple weeks.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.390
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe that email's best unread.

20:32.191 --> 20:36.953
[SPEAKER_10]: But also he's saying something about, do Koopa and Purin exist in Super Smash Bros.

20:36.973 --> 20:37.193
[SPEAKER_10]: Melee?

20:37.213 --> 20:38.174
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he means Brawl.

20:39.555 --> 20:50.780
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, he was saying that if you change the language, Bowser becomes Koopa and Jigglypuff becomes Purin, which was their original names, and then you can save them that way?

20:52.661 --> 20:55.463
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you mean, so sorry.

20:56.735 --> 20:57.896
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only other email.

20:58.776 --> 21:04.440
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, that one that I lost was from somebody named Jake.

21:06.001 --> 21:06.862
[SPEAKER_06]: You lost an email?

21:07.783 --> 21:10.344
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's, he didn't put a signature on there.

21:10.364 --> 21:14.507
[SPEAKER_10]: The one that I mistakenly gave to Cheeseburger.

21:15.168 --> 21:15.308
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

21:16.969 --> 21:17.209
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

21:17.970 --> 21:18.350
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

21:18.370 --> 21:19.831
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get any like real email.

21:20.752 --> 21:21.032
[SPEAKER_04]: Weak.

21:21.616 --> 21:25.079
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for some spam that I'm deleting right now that's titled LOL.

21:28.242 --> 21:29.022
[SPEAKER_10]: And Rob did it.

21:30.924 --> 21:31.344
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

21:32.385 --> 21:33.646
[SPEAKER_10]: It's titled LOL and you laughed.

21:33.826 --> 21:34.167
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

21:34.367 --> 21:34.687
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

21:34.887 --> 21:35.187
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

21:35.348 --> 21:36.288
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

21:36.468 --> 21:36.849
[SPEAKER_10]: Lost.

21:38.170 --> 21:39.071
[SPEAKER_06]: Weak mailbag.

21:39.111 --> 21:40.232
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm disappointed in all of you.

21:40.272 --> 21:45.376
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I blame not having a part B last week where we actually had a mailbag to remind you that you can send us emails.

21:45.416 --> 21:46.877
[SPEAKER_06]: So send us emails.

21:46.897 --> 21:47.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at originalsradio.com.

21:48.871 --> 21:50.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a hardcore gamer?

21:50.212 --> 21:50.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

21:51.152 --> 21:53.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you downloaded the hardcore gamer pack yet?

21:53.334 --> 21:53.654
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

21:54.034 --> 21:55.835
[SPEAKER_03]: Well then you're not really a hardcore gamer.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, how dare you!

21:57.696 --> 21:58.197
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

21:58.777 --> 22:12.105
[SPEAKER_03]: On Xbox Live Marketplace, there is a brand new hardcore gamer picture pack featuring such wonderful pictures as Proud to be a Noob, Camper, Respawn, a little target symbol, and Teabag.

22:12.265 --> 22:13.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Teabagged.

22:14.827 --> 22:15.147
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

22:15.167 --> 22:15.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

22:15.809 --> 22:18.190
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to buy this, it's only $1.25.

22:19.971 --> 22:25.673
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, all people know that you're truly hardcore if you buy this and display them proudly.

22:26.153 --> 22:31.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I would like to point out that for free, you can download community gamer picks.

22:31.656 --> 22:34.417
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're in pack number two of the community gamer picks.

22:34.777 --> 22:36.818
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a little pick that says OLR.

22:37.178 --> 22:41.860
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you put that on your gamer tag, at least we'll know you're hardcore, as will all the rest of the OLR army.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.081
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't download this crap.

22:44.827 --> 22:45.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't pay for this.

22:45.707 --> 22:47.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, these look really stupid.

22:48.629 --> 22:50.490
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt sums up my thoughts exactly.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.211
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do they need to endorse stupidity that is teabagging?

22:53.511 --> 22:53.832
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.233
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should ask disruptive media publishers.

22:56.813 --> 22:57.533
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should.

22:58.174 --> 22:59.134
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a telephone number?

22:59.394 --> 23:00.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's call them right now.

23:00.215 --> 23:00.815
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they're there.

23:01.555 --> 23:01.896
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

23:01.956 --> 23:02.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get on that.

23:04.137 --> 23:05.577
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll send them an email maybe this week.

23:06.118 --> 23:06.498
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

23:08.823 --> 23:11.785
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to download the hardcore gamer picks, Loki?

23:12.946 --> 23:14.147
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm doing it right now.

23:14.407 --> 23:14.847
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

23:15.147 --> 23:15.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

23:17.589 --> 23:23.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's pretty hardcore as well is proposing to your significant other over a video game.

23:23.433 --> 23:24.914
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you know what's really hardcore?

23:24.954 --> 23:26.395
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember last year we had this story.

23:26.415 --> 23:27.876
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we had a Viva Pinata story.

23:28.196 --> 23:29.997
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an Animal Crossing story, I want to say.

23:30.457 --> 23:32.699
[SPEAKER_06]: And this time, this is kind of interesting.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.462
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually made a homebrew version of...

23:38.376 --> 23:41.628
[SPEAKER_06]: of his significant other's favorite game, which was Bejeweled.

23:42.375 --> 23:44.476
[SPEAKER_06]: He made a homebrew version of this on the DS.

23:44.897 --> 23:47.378
[SPEAKER_06]: And this guy, Bernie, he's actually a user on Zanga.

23:47.919 --> 23:54.203
[SPEAKER_06]: What he did, he spent a few weeks actually making this Nintendo DS version of Bejeweled completely from the ground up.

23:54.683 --> 23:59.126
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happens is that once the game gets to a certain score, the screen clears.

23:59.587 --> 24:03.769
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what would happen is that a ring of the jewels comes up on the screen.

24:04.190 --> 24:12.155
[SPEAKER_06]: And what he did is that when his girlfriend was playing the game and then got on the special screen, Bernie actually had a real ring there and proposed.

24:13.356 --> 24:31.467
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody aww sorry hairball but no that's definitely dedication to build a game to propose to your significant other with that's pretty hardcore so

24:32.597 --> 24:33.077
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

24:34.517 --> 24:54.122
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, if you would like to email Disruptive Media Publishers and tell them how crappy those hardcore gamer pics are, you can email them at info at DisruptivePublishers.com I also have a mailing address on DisruptivePublishers.com Check it out.

24:54.162 --> 24:54.943
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in Washington.

24:55.063 --> 24:56.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Bellingham, Washington.

24:56.643 --> 25:00.784
[SPEAKER_06]: Ossifer in chat suggests teabag your girlfriend for instant marriage.

25:01.940 --> 25:03.701
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have a Facebook community, too.

25:03.761 --> 25:04.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Let her know you're hardcore.

25:04.782 --> 25:06.243
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the cool kids are on Facebook now.

25:06.263 --> 25:06.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Teabagger.

25:09.725 --> 25:10.605
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, DarkSakura?

25:10.885 --> 25:13.567
[SPEAKER_06]: If Dan teabagged you in Halo, that's love, right?

25:16.569 --> 25:17.630
[SPEAKER_10]: My silence is my answer.

25:17.670 --> 25:18.650
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting blinked at.

25:19.591 --> 25:20.771
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps we should move on, then.

25:21.892 --> 25:28.176
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for anyone who's a fan of Undertow, there is an expansion out that it costs...

25:28.803 --> 25:30.324
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:51.119 --> 25:59.701
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's five levels, you have a new alien race called The Elect, wow, and four multiplayer maps, so there's no other details than that.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.541
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it's been fixed.

26:04.122 --> 26:04.322
Huh.

26:04.782 --> 26:14.144
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was free for, I mean, the game was free for a while, you know, to make up for Xbox Live outages, although I'm not sure if that's really more of a punishment for us or for, you know,

26:15.111 --> 26:15.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

26:16.492 --> 26:21.814
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say I was an Undertow fan, but, you know, it's hard to bitch when something's free.

26:22.034 --> 26:23.235
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really hard to complain.

26:23.655 --> 26:30.278
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I think about Totem Ball and Yaris, and there's been some real shit free games on Xbox Live.

26:30.679 --> 26:32.900
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, like, Agent's Wing wasn't bad.

26:33.780 --> 26:36.461
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.

26:36.541 --> 26:37.382
[SPEAKER_06]: It was no Yaris.

26:37.442 --> 26:37.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

26:38.082 --> 26:40.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

26:40.643 --> 26:41.904
[SPEAKER_03]: Yaris is unforgivable.

26:42.024 --> 26:43.905
[SPEAKER_03]: I will never buy a Yaris because of that.

26:45.302 --> 26:46.443
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah, they suck.

26:47.804 --> 26:59.571
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a rumor that there's going to be a price cut coming for European Xbox 360s and apparently the price cut is supposed to happen on March 14th.

26:59.691 --> 27:05.694
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a price cut of 50 euros and I guess we'll see if this actually happens.

27:05.814 --> 27:12.458
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being reported by TechRadar and apparently they got the news of a new SKU

27:14.805 --> 27:19.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Numerous well-placed game industry sources, they said, have confirmed it.

27:20.230 --> 27:34.521
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would bring the price, I guess, of the 360 to 250 euros for the arcade pack, and around 150 euros for the 360, and then the arcade would be 197 euros.

27:34.541 --> 27:35.502
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

27:39.645 --> 27:42.067
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that happens, but I guess we'll find out soon if that's the case.

27:42.682 --> 27:44.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, price cuts aren't a bad thing.

27:44.762 --> 27:48.443
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I cannot think of a story where we've talked about a price cut and it was a bad thing.

27:49.503 --> 27:52.384
[SPEAKER_06]: So... I'm thinking.

27:52.944 --> 27:56.245
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Loki, the devil's advocate here on the program, trying to think of something.

27:56.805 --> 27:57.925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's the chat as well.

27:57.965 --> 28:00.065
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you think about that while I report on this.

28:01.065 --> 28:02.326
[SPEAKER_06]: Other worldly news.

28:02.806 --> 28:06.587
[SPEAKER_06]: Asia is finally going to be getting Guitar Hero.

28:07.067 --> 28:08.327
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's kind of interesting...

28:09.700 --> 28:15.064
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard is actually going to be helping the game actually come to Asia, because you know how Activision just recently combined with Blizzard?

28:15.664 --> 28:23.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Blizzard has the institutional expertise to bring Guitar Hero to places like China and Korea.

28:23.629 --> 28:26.411
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you kind of think about it, Blizzard did launch World of Warcraft.

28:26.431 --> 28:27.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how they're doing it.

28:27.712 --> 28:27.912
[SPEAKER_03]: How?

28:28.212 --> 28:33.195
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have it where if you play the game well enough, you gain experience in World of Warcraft on your account.

28:33.496 --> 28:33.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

28:34.456 --> 28:34.836
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

28:34.856 --> 28:35.397
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

28:36.508 --> 29:05.841
[SPEAKER_06]: apparently the Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has also said this he's brought up the possibility of maybe putting other instruments in Guitar Hero which would be no surprise if you remember our story on DJ Heroes I've got a totally great idea this has never been attempted ever before we're gonna put singing and drums in the game and guess what we also may put keyboards never been done before in the face of the earth we are the first and then we're gonna have a turntable and five to seven keys they need a zither hero

29:07.338 --> 29:08.238
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want Sitar Hero.

29:08.278 --> 29:11.280
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are our awards for originality and innovation?

29:11.420 --> 29:13.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me Didgeridoo Hero.

29:13.361 --> 29:14.121
[SPEAKER_06]: That's original.

29:21.704 --> 29:22.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Didgeridoo Hero would rock.

29:23.405 --> 29:23.845
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know it.

29:26.566 --> 29:26.906
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

29:27.707 --> 29:28.387
[SPEAKER_10]: Clarinet Hero.

29:30.390 --> 29:35.812
[SPEAKER_10]: to continue on though with Guitar Hero information for Guitar Hero 3 in time for St.

29:35.852 --> 29:59.300
[SPEAKER_10]: Patrick's Day there is going to be a pack with stuff by Dropkick Murphys which is pretty cool there will be Famous for Nothing Flanagan's Ball and Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya so that's pretty cool and also right now there's a Modern Metal pack out though that has some cool stuff on it too how very holiday appropriate

30:00.356 --> 30:04.580
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an interesting... I like Dropkick Murphys, but I like Flogging Molly better.

30:05.701 --> 30:06.522
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would have gone with them.

30:07.723 --> 30:14.911
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was on YouTube looking for didgeridoo clips so I could, you know, hypothesize what didgeridoo hero might sound like.

30:15.291 --> 30:19.095
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, I've never heard this, but this says didgeridoo techno.

30:20.116 --> 30:20.957
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be horrible.

30:23.075 --> 30:23.795
That's pretty sweet.

30:23.815 --> 30:24.695
That's actually pretty fucking rad.

30:24.715 --> 30:25.315
That is really cool.

30:25.355 --> 30:28.356
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, this aboriginal guy on the streets, he actually, this is live.

30:28.376 --> 30:30.997
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually has a little techno thing and he's playing the tree doodles.

30:31.017 --> 30:31.297
I'd buy that.

30:31.317 --> 30:32.337
[SPEAKER_05]: I would buy that in a heartbeat.

30:51.074 --> 30:55.575
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fucking sweet.

30:55.655 --> 30:56.496
[SPEAKER_06]: So hardcore.

30:56.536 --> 30:57.356
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

30:57.596 --> 30:58.296
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that song.

30:58.396 --> 30:59.577
[SPEAKER_06]: I am going to link that YouTube.

30:59.917 --> 31:00.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Search for it.

31:00.457 --> 31:02.277
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Didgeridoo Techno on YouTube.

31:02.317 --> 31:03.158
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty sweet.

31:03.198 --> 31:10.160
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know how to spell Didgeridoo, D-I-D-G-E-R-I-D-O-O I'm going to put that in my favorites on YouTube.

31:10.220 --> 31:11.420
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was pretty rad.

31:11.900 --> 31:13.921
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll actually put that in the OLR favorites right now.

31:14.841 --> 31:15.381
[SPEAKER_06]: Check that out.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.062
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.877
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sorry, we can go back to real gaming news now.

31:22.917 --> 31:24.658
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll stop the didgeridoo.

31:25.098 --> 31:27.719
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, man, this guy needs to put out a fucking album.

31:27.799 --> 31:30.220
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, we need to get him on the show.

31:31.221 --> 31:36.423
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a new, I mean, with all due respect to Middy Head and the great OLR theme he made us, he's an awesome guy.

31:36.783 --> 31:42.326
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think it's time to maybe get a fresh Orange Lounge Radio theme in here and I demand didgeridoo in the theme.

31:42.846 --> 31:43.466
[SPEAKER_10]: And auto-harp.

31:45.367 --> 31:46.428
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody needs to make that happen.

31:47.308 --> 31:48.829
[SPEAKER_06]: That is fucking awesome.

31:49.029 --> 31:49.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

31:50.794 --> 31:54.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, with Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.

32:10.492 --> 32:10.892
[SPEAKER_03]: PS3, SingStar Volume 2

32:37.438 --> 32:40.161
[SPEAKER_03]: So Australia may see another SingStar game.

32:40.481 --> 32:43.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we over here in the United States are still waiting for the first SingStar game.

32:44.084 --> 32:46.426
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have a clip of one of the new songs from SingStar.

32:46.827 --> 32:48.408
Okay, I promise that's the last time.

32:48.488 --> 32:48.609
Um...

32:59.904 --> 33:01.585
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:30.544 --> 33:32.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, snap, because, you know, have you heard that?

33:32.425 --> 33:36.667
[SPEAKER_06]: That the ESRB, actually, the publishers send information to the ESRB.

33:36.707 --> 33:37.848
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't always play the games.

33:38.488 --> 33:40.329
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of, I swear that's how it works.

33:40.349 --> 33:40.829
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very interesting.

33:40.849 --> 33:42.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know they can't play it all the way through.

33:42.450 --> 33:51.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually they get a clip or a video of, like, gameplay footage that's, you know, supposed to be the most violent or, you know, obscene stuff in the game.

33:51.455 --> 33:51.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

33:52.349 --> 33:54.050
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'd make their ratings based on that.

33:54.511 --> 33:58.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is why things like Hot Coffee were so controversial, because that was omitted.

33:58.633 --> 34:01.135
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, we're not going to go over that whole thing again.

34:01.495 --> 34:02.676
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyhow, here's the other big thing.

34:03.437 --> 34:10.682
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy also says that sequels are not judged on their own merits, but rather the merits of the games before it.

34:11.485 --> 34:13.246
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34:36.869 --> 34:40.631
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be a huge kick in the face if a lot of this is true.

34:40.651 --> 34:43.812
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've already come out and said, oh, well, blah, blah, blah.

34:43.832 --> 34:46.254
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't support his views and all that stuff.

34:46.294 --> 34:47.814
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the ECB.

34:47.854 --> 34:48.415
[SPEAKER_03]: We're awesome.

34:48.455 --> 34:49.175
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of thing.

34:49.415 --> 34:51.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Those sound like fair requests to me, though.

34:51.516 --> 34:54.037
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's just me, but it sounds very fair to me.

34:54.097 --> 34:56.218
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about those revelations, DarkSakura?

34:56.238 --> 34:57.619
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is this going to— I'm not at all surprised.

34:58.299 --> 34:59.720
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but, I mean—

35:01.103 --> 35:07.866
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of rely on the ESRB as gamers when these games come out and all these horrible things happen.

35:07.886 --> 35:09.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the butt story from Burnout earlier.

35:09.967 --> 35:13.048
[SPEAKER_06]: We go, well, the ESRB did say the rating is subject to change.

35:13.308 --> 35:17.770
[SPEAKER_06]: But if the ESRB gets discredited with stuff like this, this really screws us in a way.

35:18.570 --> 35:18.850
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

35:19.391 --> 35:19.891
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of sad.

35:21.492 --> 35:25.713
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly think it's sort of a corrupt institution anyway.

35:25.773 --> 35:29.015
[SPEAKER_06]: RawSteelUT has said that Patricia Vance has already come out and denied it.

35:29.615 --> 35:29.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

35:30.168 --> 35:31.909
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems like a given, though.

35:33.189 --> 35:35.690
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, take it as a rumor for now, but it certainly is a question.

35:36.850 --> 35:44.092
[SPEAKER_06]: I have heard from inside folks, and I'm pretty sure it's out there on the internet also, that ESRB doesn't necessarily play through the games.

35:44.492 --> 35:47.793
[SPEAKER_06]: They will rate based on stuff that you send them.

35:48.334 --> 35:49.014
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

35:49.354 --> 35:54.215
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember overhearing at a trade show once about people, and I think you were there too, Loki.

35:54.235 --> 35:59.397
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you ever heard this same conversation, but about how a particular game I'm thinking of, a particular game

36:00.012 --> 36:03.315
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even want to say because I don't want people to speculate.

36:03.335 --> 36:14.363
[SPEAKER_06]: But a particular game, I heard the developer joking with another really big industry press person about how they got this through the ESRB with a particular rating.

36:15.344 --> 36:16.985
[SPEAKER_06]: I just was kind of shocked to hear that kind of talk.

36:17.766 --> 36:18.146
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

36:25.512 --> 36:28.394
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to move away from the ESRB and how crappy they are.

36:28.634 --> 36:28.894
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's.

36:29.255 --> 36:29.675
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please.

36:30.565 --> 36:33.087
[SPEAKER_10]: Skype is actually coming out on Japanese PSPs this month.

36:33.947 --> 36:34.228
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

36:34.748 --> 36:42.073
[SPEAKER_10]: So it will be on March 18th, and it's only, of course, for the Slim PSP, the newer one.

36:43.174 --> 36:45.575
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's supposed to be a month later over here in the U.S.

36:46.916 --> 36:53.921
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, the microphone attachment is going to be 2,500 yen, or two for 4,000.

36:54.001 --> 36:54.101
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

36:54.141 --> 36:57.863
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's not bad.

36:58.564 --> 36:59.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad at all.

36:59.787 --> 37:02.528
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that Japanese PSP users will get to use this.

37:03.509 --> 37:03.889
[SPEAKER_06]: Good call.

37:04.429 --> 37:05.870
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll be able to do it a month later.

37:07.550 --> 37:08.111
[SPEAKER_06]: We already have it.

37:08.131 --> 37:12.313
[SPEAKER_06]: We got our first call last week on the Skype line from a Skype PSP user.

37:16.074 --> 37:25.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is going to be due out here next month and they have released the full list of cars and tracks that are going to be included in that.

37:27.279 --> 37:28.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of different stuff you can pick from.

37:28.960 --> 37:29.360
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe

37:29.941 --> 37:48.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it, I want to say like 65 cars and 6 tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit, the Eiger Nordwand, Fuji Speedway, London City Track, Daytona International Speedway, and the High Speed Ring.

37:49.887 --> 37:53.788
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bunch of different cars, I don't even know what to even cover on that, but

37:54.591 --> 37:58.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of stuff to keep you satisfied until the full game comes out.

37:58.614 --> 38:06.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it's going to have a brand new drift mode for the US version, as well as the ability to fine-tune your car, and two-player split-screen racing.

38:07.740 --> 38:08.880
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I guess, a new set of events.

38:10.902 --> 38:11.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad for $40.

38:15.625 --> 38:18.827
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not just Prologue, that's the full game, right?

38:18.927 --> 38:19.607
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's Prologue.

38:20.288 --> 38:21.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's just Prologue.

38:21.388 --> 38:21.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

38:21.889 --> 38:22.129
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

38:22.149 --> 38:22.249
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

38:22.588 --> 38:23.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

38:53.072 --> 38:53.973
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:20.925 --> 39:22.246
[SPEAKER_10]: Although my dentist is pretty cool.

39:22.466 --> 39:26.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how much money I would pay for a YouTube of Loki playing All-Star Cheer Squad?

39:27.148 --> 39:28.389
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no money in the world.

39:30.030 --> 39:31.410
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that'll be the next bet.

39:31.851 --> 39:38.554
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever we find another bet for Loki to take on, we'll get him to play All-Star Cheer Squad in the Tingle outfit.

39:42.256 --> 39:44.257
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to make this happen somehow.

39:44.895 --> 39:48.577
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be opening the Skype line after this next story.

39:48.597 --> 39:52.379
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

39:53.340 --> 39:55.681
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and give us a call after this story.

39:57.062 --> 40:12.131
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for people who were fans of the Castlevania series and collect action figures, it doesn't look like we're going to really be getting the new figures that they were discussing.

40:12.471 --> 40:12.551
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

40:14.143 --> 40:30.530
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, basically, they were saying, they were asked if there were going to be any more in that Castlevania line and it was reported that there were no plans at all and no news on Castlevania figures and that they will not be revisiting the license.

40:32.911 --> 40:33.792
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's kind of a bummer.

40:34.512 --> 40:35.973
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a Richter figure, dang it.

40:36.253 --> 40:36.673
[SPEAKER_06]: Richter.

40:36.693 --> 40:39.514
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to say it, you have to say it right.

40:39.714 --> 40:40.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Richter.

40:40.195 --> 40:40.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Richter.

40:43.024 --> 40:43.844
[SPEAKER_06]: Skypline is open.

40:43.864 --> 40:45.585
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

40:45.605 --> 40:48.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

40:48.767 --> 40:50.928
[SPEAKER_06]: While we're waiting for some calls, how about some last-minute stories?

40:50.948 --> 40:52.168
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything for us tonight, Loki?

40:54.429 --> 40:56.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't.

40:58.311 --> 40:58.591
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

40:59.192 --> 41:00.272
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually covered everything?

41:01.533 --> 41:03.554
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I'm sure there's some other stuff.

41:03.574 --> 41:04.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank God a call's coming in.

41:06.555 --> 41:07.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

41:07.816 --> 41:08.196
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

41:09.602 --> 41:11.163
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Ross TLUT.

41:11.183 --> 41:13.424
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me shut the speakers down.

41:13.444 --> 41:13.965
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.

41:14.085 --> 41:14.625
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's all right.

41:14.665 --> 41:15.726
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, Ross TLUT?

41:17.347 --> 41:17.827
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

41:17.847 --> 41:24.091
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to talk about the whole thing with the guy whose 360 got wiped clean.

41:24.732 --> 41:28.554
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then Bungie actually had to fix it and all that stuff.

41:28.834 --> 41:29.975
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your thoughts on that?

41:31.116 --> 41:34.998
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, much love to Bungie, but where the fuck is Microsoft?

41:35.158 --> 41:38.220
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they were going to help the guy, and then we haven't heard from them since.

41:38.621 --> 41:38.981
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

41:39.611 --> 41:42.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but isn't Bungie, like, oh no, because they split.

41:43.252 --> 41:56.558
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep wanting to say, oh, but Bungie is partially... Well, they split, but still, it wasn't Bungie's fault, it was the... And that's the thing, this wasn't, this isn't some sort of little casual accident, because, from what I understand, the console was marked as permanent marker.

41:57.418 --> 42:03.481
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you had to, whoever did this had to really, you know, get in there, you know what I mean?

42:03.681 --> 42:06.802
[SPEAKER_06]: I always thought that they just gave the console a different shell.

42:07.954 --> 42:10.215
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they all go through some sort of power wash.

42:39.701 --> 42:41.381
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a high pressure wash.

42:41.702 --> 42:43.662
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's going to make your Xbox look new again?

42:44.523 --> 42:44.783
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

42:44.963 --> 42:45.724
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, yeah.

42:45.964 --> 42:47.224
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

42:47.304 --> 42:49.545
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if... Oh my gosh.

42:49.986 --> 42:53.587
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, and you can see... Oh, thanks for the link to the blog.

42:53.607 --> 42:54.068
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

42:54.088 --> 42:56.609
[SPEAKER_06]: You can totally see how some of the ink is just like rubbed off.

42:57.398 --> 43:01.161
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's like how you might put like your ring or something.

43:01.181 --> 43:07.486
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm thinking last weekend I watched my friend get her engagement ring washed and they have like a machine that does it, you know, make it look new again.

43:07.526 --> 43:10.408
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like kind of that type of thing, make sure Xbox 360 look new again.

43:10.908 --> 43:11.609
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird.

43:12.410 --> 43:13.330
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

43:13.670 --> 43:18.914
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not surprised by Microsoft having incompetent tech support.

43:18.934 --> 43:25.780
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, after I had my 360 sent in early November and I got a refurb and it took me...

43:26.913 --> 43:30.696
[SPEAKER_08]: 4 months to finally get my XBLA games revalidated to the console.

43:31.357 --> 43:34.239
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, neither of them ever buying anything off the marketplace again.

43:34.359 --> 43:35.340
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a big mess.

43:36.001 --> 43:43.427
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when I sent my Xbox 360 back, thankfully I only had two arcade games purchased at the time, and they're not ones I play super... Well, I take that back.

43:43.867 --> 43:47.010
[SPEAKER_06]: Joust was one, I haven't played that in a while, but Geometry Wars was the other.

43:47.490 --> 43:52.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, I haven't had much issues, because since it is tied to your Xbox Live name, it recognizes me, you know, and all that stuff.

43:53.455 --> 43:56.916
[SPEAKER_06]: and it lets me play the full version but I do have to wait like a couple seconds.

43:56.976 --> 44:04.898
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean obviously I'm not going to get frustrated over a couple seconds but I'm just thinking like I've heard of other people who've lost a lot more than two arcade games and it's just a pain in the ass.

44:04.918 --> 44:11.820
[SPEAKER_08]: Well the problem with XBLA is that you cannot play your stuff offline if you do a refurb.

44:13.421 --> 44:13.941
[SPEAKER_08]: You know...

44:14.622 --> 44:16.602
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to be online at all times.

44:16.722 --> 44:19.483
[SPEAKER_08]: And like a couple of days ago, my internet was on the fritz and I couldn't do that.

44:19.543 --> 44:24.444
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, there goes Geometry Wars, there goes Symphony of the Night, Contra, you know, a few others.

44:24.604 --> 44:25.024
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

44:25.124 --> 44:28.685
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkTetsuya points out that this isn't just a Microsoft thing.

44:28.725 --> 44:31.365
[SPEAKER_06]: He says in chat, it's the same with Virtual Console.

44:31.585 --> 44:34.486
[SPEAKER_06]: When I got my Wii back, I had to re-download them, but they didn't cost extra.

44:34.506 --> 44:35.406
[SPEAKER_06]: They were free to replace.

44:35.706 --> 44:36.486
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not so bad.

44:36.526 --> 44:37.587
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it worked then.

44:37.647 --> 44:40.267
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, at least you can use them without being online.

44:40.307 --> 44:41.127
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the important thing.

44:41.187 --> 44:42.008
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

44:42.048 --> 44:44.308
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if I got to download it again, sure, whatever.

44:45.129 --> 44:57.659
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but this just struck me as an especially evil thing to do to somebody, you know, because there's no reason to do that, especially as the guy said, hey, I don't want my, um, I don't want my thing cleaned, you know?

44:58.059 --> 45:11.490
[SPEAKER_06]: I would understand, like, if Microsoft did this whole, like, power wash thing, and, you know, they didn't, you know, I could understand how they might miss the special request, and just everything goes on the assembly line, they don't pay really any attention to it, it's, you know, fixed line, fixed...

45:12.111 --> 45:15.993
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Microsoft should at least come out and let us know publicly that that's what happened.

45:16.453 --> 45:19.214
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Microsoft is so out there in the community.

45:19.274 --> 45:20.354
[SPEAKER_06]: They worked really hard.

45:20.794 --> 45:24.476
[SPEAKER_06]: They have Gamerscore Blog, Major Nelson, and all these people.

45:24.956 --> 45:29.078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure these people are aware of this negative story being out there on the blog.

45:29.158 --> 45:34.580
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really think Microsoft will say something about it eventually and kind of admit, oops, my bad.

45:35.040 --> 45:37.461
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is that Microsoft...

45:38.257 --> 45:39.738
[SPEAKER_08]: for everything they do in the community.

45:39.758 --> 45:41.439
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a million horror stories.

45:41.799 --> 45:44.340
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the alarming amount of red rings.

45:44.380 --> 45:50.823
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the nightmare with getting your stuff validated on your console so you can use it offline again.

45:51.364 --> 45:51.984
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's this.

45:52.044 --> 45:57.246
[SPEAKER_08]: It really makes you wonder if the left hand even knows what the right hand is doing.

45:57.327 --> 45:58.467
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to bet, though?

45:59.628 --> 46:06.171
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why Bungie did this for this guy is that somebody at Microsoft saw this story on the blogs, their community outreach people, and made a phone call.

46:07.661 --> 46:10.003
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they were like, yeah, could you help us out here?

46:10.584 --> 46:11.205
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

46:11.765 --> 46:12.806
[SPEAKER_06]: We fucked up.

46:12.826 --> 46:13.647
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you save our ass?

46:15.308 --> 46:15.749
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.

46:16.810 --> 46:29.141
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, on better Microsoft news, the Financial Times is reporting that Microsoft might be considering more Blu-ray support.

46:30.131 --> 46:32.972
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people have even speculated a Blu-ray draw for the 360.

46:33.573 --> 46:43.857
[SPEAKER_06]: I have heard about that, that Microsoft is supposedly in talks with Sony about the whole Blu-ray add-on, which is a very strange kind of marriage, but I guess one step that Microsoft might have to make at this point.

46:43.897 --> 46:44.777
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, might have to make.

46:44.997 --> 46:45.978
[SPEAKER_08]: They do have to make.

46:46.138 --> 46:47.298
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, do they?

46:47.618 --> 46:53.981
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to understand the majority of people on a console at the end aren't going to be online.

46:56.144 --> 46:58.407
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to have the offline option.

46:58.627 --> 47:00.049
[SPEAKER_06]: How come the Wii doesn't have to do it?

47:02.333 --> 47:05.838
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the Wii is not being marketed as a media center.

47:06.959 --> 47:08.321
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had this conversation before.

47:08.381 --> 47:08.782
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being...

47:10.176 --> 47:13.298
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being marketed on, oh, look at the cute little novelty controller, you know.

47:13.378 --> 47:25.827
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, as you start adding in, you know, the forecast channel, the news channel, the weather, I'm sorry, I just said the same thing, the TV guide channel, all this other stuff, it's a different type of center of sorts.

47:27.768 --> 47:28.108
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

47:29.770 --> 47:37.295
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't see the marketing in the sort of multimedia center of the home thing, you know.

47:38.052 --> 48:06.845
[SPEAKER_08]: and I agree with Frisbee I don't need it to be but you know it's you know also Microsoft but it makes it appealing the reason that might stop this is that Microsoft doesn't want to be seen as admitting picking a losing side you know they pretty much had to give away those HD DVD add-ons which I thought was funny you know what I gotta wrap up so we can get some other calls but here's the thing I would kind of close on this I would bet that Microsoft doesn't end up doing it and they'll just build it into their next system

48:08.427 --> 48:14.211
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my guess, the 720 would be... I mean, I would imagine both the 720 and the PS4 would be Blu-ray.

48:14.691 --> 48:17.713
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and we're probably years off from both, but I think you're right.

48:17.753 --> 48:22.516
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if they do talk to him about Blu-ray, I think it'll wait until the next Xbox system.

48:24.577 --> 48:25.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

48:25.158 --> 48:28.900
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to let you go, Rusty, because we've got to get some other calls, but thanks so much for your call.

48:29.180 --> 48:29.621
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

48:29.921 --> 48:30.581
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, have a good one.

48:30.661 --> 48:31.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

48:32.062 --> 48:33.603
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

48:33.663 --> 48:37.986
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

48:38.482 --> 48:39.463
[SPEAKER_06]: That call was seven minutes.

48:39.483 --> 48:40.804
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to limit him to about four.

48:41.425 --> 48:42.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:42.525 --> 48:42.866
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

48:43.887 --> 48:45.308
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, it's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.

48:45.328 --> 48:45.608
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?

48:45.648 --> 48:47.229
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore from Ultimate Quest.

48:47.249 --> 48:49.131
[SPEAKER_06]: How are things doing on the Ultimate Quest, Xenocore?

48:49.972 --> 49:01.521
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've been sort of hectic considering we've been on and off on our weekends, mainly because I went to MegaCon this last weekend up in Orlando and doing a little bit of coverage here and there.

49:02.102 --> 49:04.784
[SPEAKER_00]: My first one, actually, I just popped a conch area on MegaCon.

49:05.845 --> 49:06.285
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that out.

49:06.306 --> 49:06.886
[SPEAKER_00]: What an interesting...

49:07.239 --> 49:09.561
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the website again for folks who want to check out that?

49:11.262 --> 49:12.783
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the convention or for our show?

49:13.103 --> 49:13.503
[SPEAKER_00]: For the show.

49:14.664 --> 49:16.765
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the show is at ultimatequest.net.

49:18.447 --> 49:20.908
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear about something on it last week since I missed recording.

49:21.208 --> 49:22.910
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get back till late this evening.

49:24.050 --> 49:26.292
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, man, Megacon was something else.

49:26.352 --> 49:26.912
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness.

49:27.132 --> 49:28.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you called in to talk about tonight was Megacon?

49:28.793 --> 49:29.114
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

49:29.894 --> 49:30.555
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.

49:30.575 --> 49:35.478
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on top of that, they had the first Smash Brothers tournament I happened to catch, which is kind of interesting.

49:36.957 --> 49:38.038
[SPEAKER_00]: The cosplayers, man.

49:40.359 --> 49:42.500
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't ready for that level of dedication at all.

49:42.700 --> 49:45.462
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, there's some cosplayers that are so good at what they do.

49:45.522 --> 49:47.383
[SPEAKER_06]: It is astounding.

49:47.443 --> 49:48.383
[SPEAKER_06]: That's love right there.

49:48.943 --> 49:51.085
[SPEAKER_06]: What were some of the cool cosplays you saw, Xenocor?

49:51.285 --> 49:54.086
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got to mention this one that stood out for everything.

49:54.406 --> 50:01.050
[SPEAKER_00]: A 14-year-old girl doing the Mighty Edward from Cowboy Bebop in character all three days.

50:01.690 --> 50:03.491
[SPEAKER_00]: Laptop on her head the entire time.

50:04.712 --> 50:04.852
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

50:04.872 --> 50:05.492
[SPEAKER_00]: That was impressive.

50:05.936 --> 50:06.497
[SPEAKER_00]: Lost Odyssey

50:19.666 --> 50:20.807
[SPEAKER_00]: We on our show did not.

50:20.887 --> 50:24.210
[SPEAKER_00]: Henderson Man actually spoke up for the show to review that one.

50:24.950 --> 50:26.351
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't grabbed it yet.

50:26.811 --> 50:30.994
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kind of curious because I know you guys kind of specialize in the role-playing games.

50:31.034 --> 50:34.237
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious, and maybe I'll have to wait until you guys tape a future episode.

50:34.257 --> 50:40.001
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious of your general thoughts on the game because the critics overall kind of dogged it a little bit, but I'm in love with it.

50:40.161 --> 50:41.962
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a fantastic game.

50:43.471 --> 50:49.858
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the main thing that caught my attention is something Henderson mentioned, is that you can't out-level the bosses in Lost Odyssey.

50:50.459 --> 50:54.663
[SPEAKER_00]: The bosses level according to what level you are, so the bosses are always difficult.

50:54.683 --> 50:55.104
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

50:55.364 --> 50:57.066
[SPEAKER_06]: No wonder there's such pains in the ass.

50:57.306 --> 50:57.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

50:58.307 --> 50:58.888
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't level.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.378
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't level?

51:00.678 --> 51:07.562
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because there's actually some guides out there, the Prima guides and stuff, that tell you what level you should be at to play the boss.

51:07.963 --> 51:11.765
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you would have to grind a little bit, you can't just go from one boss to the next.

51:11.865 --> 51:17.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it maybe because even though the bosses level up, you get more skills, so it makes it easier regardless?

51:18.730 --> 51:24.734
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be my thought, is that maybe, yeah, the bosses are leveling up, but since you get more skills, you get power on them that way, if that makes sense.

51:26.015 --> 51:27.716
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a large part of the game is skills.

51:30.327 --> 51:33.410
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've got so far is based on Henderson Man's review.

51:34.751 --> 51:37.933
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be playing it myself sooner or later as soon as a budget allows for it.

51:38.694 --> 51:41.356
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, I can only go by word of mouth pretty much.

51:42.117 --> 51:44.018
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Xenocore.

51:44.098 --> 51:48.181
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had to ask because it's been a large part of my gaming time lately.

51:48.702 --> 51:49.683
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did you call in to talk about?

51:49.723 --> 51:50.103
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

51:50.904 --> 51:56.308
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, mainly it was just that I happened to come across my first con and decided to share it with fellow con lovers, so.

51:57.552 --> 52:03.014
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while since I've been to a con, but definitely we have Fanime coming up in May or June, right?

52:03.034 --> 52:03.554
[SPEAKER_06]: When's Fanime?

52:03.574 --> 52:04.894
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Memorial Day weekend, Fanime?

52:05.615 --> 52:06.015
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is.

52:06.175 --> 52:09.316
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I'm probably not going this year.

52:09.736 --> 52:11.236
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is it the same time as your road trip?

52:12.317 --> 52:12.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

52:13.377 --> 52:13.457
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

52:14.057 --> 52:17.218
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh, well, that's a bummer, because we always do our show there.

52:18.599 --> 52:20.159
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's see.

52:20.359 --> 52:22.960
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's other cons coming up, and I still want to go to that one in Chicago.

52:23.100 --> 52:23.880
[SPEAKER_06]: ASIN, is that it?

52:24.020 --> 52:25.121
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want to go to ASIN.

52:25.621 --> 52:25.981
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

52:26.101 --> 52:26.421
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.559
[SPEAKER_10]: and I have information on that too.

52:30.219 --> 52:30.479
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

52:30.939 --> 52:31.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Later then.

52:31.660 --> 52:32.100
[SPEAKER_06]: Later it is.

52:33.161 --> 52:36.302
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore, anything else before I let you go?

52:36.362 --> 52:41.005
[SPEAKER_00]: That and the largest Yuri-Yowie argument I've ever heard in my entire life.

52:41.065 --> 52:42.126
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, that was fine.

52:44.347 --> 52:46.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Some things you can never escape at cons.

52:47.148 --> 52:48.549
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go to YowieCon.

52:48.569 --> 52:49.770
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing is an argument.

52:51.371 --> 52:54.773
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore, thanks so much for your call and have a good one and good luck with your own show.

52:55.748 --> 52:56.548
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, take it easy, guys.

52:56.768 --> 52:57.048
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

52:57.108 --> 52:57.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

52:58.609 --> 53:00.669
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly is the Yuri-Yowie argument?

53:01.009 --> 53:01.370
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, hold on.

53:01.390 --> 53:02.430
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask our next caller.

53:02.830 --> 53:03.710
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

53:03.730 --> 53:04.130
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

53:04.951 --> 53:05.491
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

53:05.511 --> 53:06.331
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care who it is.

53:07.391 --> 53:08.111
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care who it is.

53:08.231 --> 53:12.633
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to ask you, DJ Ranma S, I want to ask you, what is the Yuri-Yowie argument?

53:17.494 --> 53:18.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.

53:18.494 --> 53:20.935
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly is the Yuri-Yowie argument?

53:21.590 --> 53:26.313
[SPEAKER_01]: You got these fangirls who argue about what's better, Yuri or Yaoi.

53:26.653 --> 53:28.794
[SPEAKER_01]: They run around with these paddles.

53:28.814 --> 53:32.356
[SPEAKER_01]: They will start smacking you with them if you do not agree with them.

53:33.377 --> 53:33.977
[SPEAKER_10]: This is true.

53:33.997 --> 53:38.080
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I said going to YaoiCon is like a whole argument in and of itself.

53:39.480 --> 53:44.563
[SPEAKER_01]: My other friend Jasmine, she has this priestess outfit.

53:44.583 --> 53:49.246
[SPEAKER_01]: She walks around with an anti-Yaoi paper fan that she smacks people with.

53:50.472 --> 53:51.973
[SPEAKER_06]: That is nothing short of amazing.

53:52.053 --> 53:53.495
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how else to describe it.

53:53.695 --> 53:55.696
[SPEAKER_06]: But they yell at each other.

53:55.716 --> 53:59.039
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this sounds like stupid fun, but they actually get upset over this.

53:59.059 --> 54:03.163
[SPEAKER_06]: They really do think they're going to beat it into you to yell at you.

54:04.521 --> 54:05.522
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them do.

54:05.622 --> 54:14.127
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a couple of years back at Animazement, we had like this line of people on one side, you had the ninjas, you had on the other side the pirates.

54:14.387 --> 54:18.029
[SPEAKER_01]: We were shouting back and forth, ninjas were better or pirates were better.

54:18.049 --> 54:20.530
[SPEAKER_01]: It got to the point where staff had to break us all up.

54:20.890 --> 54:27.154
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe about an hour later, we started a conga line singing ninja rap all throughout the entire convention area.

54:27.514 --> 54:28.615
[SPEAKER_06]: Cons are so weird.

54:28.635 --> 54:30.636
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was...

54:31.468 --> 54:36.850
[SPEAKER_10]: The funny thing about Anime Expo every year is that wherever they schedule it, they also schedule some sort of religious convention.

54:37.911 --> 54:40.932
[SPEAKER_10]: So you get the people preaching to the cosplayers in line.

54:42.213 --> 54:50.236
[SPEAKER_10]: And one year a bunch of us just started just completely telling them off in various other languages that weren't necessarily Japanese.

54:52.037 --> 54:55.959
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people that would pay a lot of money to see women beat each other up with paddles.

54:57.800 --> 55:00.761
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can get this all for free at your local anime convention.

55:01.638 --> 55:04.619
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much, and Jamie, there is a voice actor.

55:04.659 --> 55:05.539
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Vic.

55:05.579 --> 55:06.879
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like a born-again Christian.

55:06.899 --> 55:08.460
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the voice of Ed from FMA.

55:09.140 --> 55:15.722
[SPEAKER_01]: At AnimeCon, he has like a panel of Sunday morning service for con goers to come and arrive for service.

55:16.742 --> 55:18.263
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool.

55:18.563 --> 55:19.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's kind of neat.

55:19.903 --> 55:21.424
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen that happen at various conventions.

55:21.864 --> 55:23.784
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for people that want to do that, why not?

55:24.484 --> 55:24.825
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

55:26.005 --> 55:26.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

55:27.784 --> 55:34.267
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's another quote that I love from RossDLUT in chat says, This is different from console fanboys how?

55:36.228 --> 55:39.750
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox, Playstation, Xbox, Playstation, Wii!

55:40.891 --> 55:50.357
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about you guys, but I'd rather see a bunch of girls in cute outfits screaming Yaoi versus Yuri than a bunch of fanboys shouting what console is better, you know?

55:50.697 --> 55:51.717
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to agree with you there.

55:52.338 --> 55:52.558
Yeah.

55:53.618 --> 55:56.080
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

55:57.225 --> 55:57.866
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things.

55:58.766 --> 56:00.568
[SPEAKER_01]: The 360 with the missing autographs.

56:00.928 --> 56:03.710
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was me, I would have bit the bullet and bought a new console.

56:04.631 --> 56:04.851
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

56:06.052 --> 56:06.952
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have done the same thing.

56:07.673 --> 56:09.214
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly what I would have done.

56:11.075 --> 56:12.737
[SPEAKER_06]: But they gave him back the console.

56:12.757 --> 56:14.698
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem wasn't that he didn't have a working console.

56:14.798 --> 56:15.239
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

56:15.479 --> 56:16.860
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't have left that to fate.

56:16.940 --> 56:20.743
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not have put in something that valuable in the hands of other people.

56:20.823 --> 56:21.223
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

56:21.403 --> 56:21.784
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

56:22.104 --> 56:24.886
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would never have sent the console in to be repaired in the first place.

56:25.598 --> 56:26.199
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

56:46.605 --> 56:47.246
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

56:47.306 --> 56:50.689
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I got into Prodigy during the age of Windows and stuff like that.

56:50.749 --> 56:51.250
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

56:51.270 --> 56:52.091
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I got into.

56:52.391 --> 56:52.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, no.

56:53.192 --> 56:53.933
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Prodigy.

56:53.953 --> 56:55.374
[SPEAKER_01]: You go way old school, yeah.

56:55.494 --> 57:00.079
[SPEAKER_01]: I had DOS-based Prodigy, HWPD42B.

57:01.220 --> 57:06.045
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Radio Shack stores had Prodigy set up for people for free to try out and stuff.

57:06.085 --> 57:06.285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

57:06.665 --> 57:08.307
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we found out about it the first time.

57:09.547 --> 57:11.648
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know what happened to Prodigy, right?

57:12.649 --> 57:16.310
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they get absolved into, basically they're like an ISP now, aren't they?

57:17.030 --> 57:18.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they're a part of Yahoo, aren't they?

57:19.511 --> 57:22.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, they're like the red-headed bastard stepchild of AT&T.

57:23.053 --> 57:30.036
[SPEAKER_01]: Like about one or two years ago they were trying to sell off the name of everybody and the whole thing to the highest bidder and they're still trying to do that.

57:30.720 --> 57:30.800
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

57:30.820 --> 57:32.721
[SPEAKER_06]: ColecoVision Adam Which is ironic if people know you very well

57:58.387 --> 57:58.768
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

57:59.549 --> 58:00.610
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you guys later.

58:01.651 --> 58:02.551
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, Ranma.

58:02.932 --> 58:03.332
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

58:03.412 --> 58:03.833
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

58:04.053 --> 58:05.394
[SPEAKER_06]: Or should I say ColecoVision?

58:05.955 --> 58:06.255
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

58:07.957 --> 58:08.838
[SPEAKER_06]: Colecoman!

58:09.058 --> 58:11.100
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call.

58:11.120 --> 58:13.002
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

58:13.082 --> 58:14.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

58:15.604 --> 58:20.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, I did actually get a last-minute news story from somebody.

58:22.251 --> 58:22.631
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is it?

58:24.677 --> 58:35.164
[SPEAKER_06]: Video game companies think they might be able to survive the slowing down of the economy.

58:35.864 --> 58:41.668
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently video games have defied the sagging retail sales figures of December 2007.

58:42.508 --> 58:46.091
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo actually talked to CNBC, specifically Reggie Fils-Aimé,

58:46.713 --> 58:50.654
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say I have a couple last minute stories for after this.

58:50.674 --> 58:51.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is Osferd.

59:16.110 --> 59:17.131
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's all right.

59:29.724 --> 59:37.486
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's just pretty interesting with the whole Yowie Yuri argument, and I'm actually going to be going to my first convention in May, so I'll be sure to look out for that.

59:38.426 --> 59:38.906
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

59:38.967 --> 59:42.607
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just avoid the women that have the Yowie Yuri paddles unless you're into that.

59:42.627 --> 59:43.948
[SPEAKER_10]: And watch out for the free hugs.

59:43.988 --> 59:45.068
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know if they've been tested.

59:45.228 --> 59:48.429
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if somebody's wearing a glomp sign, run the other way.

59:51.010 --> 59:54.691
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to experience full on, so I'm actually going to go run towards them for the heck of it.

59:55.671 --> 59:57.071
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, don't say we didn't warn you, bud.

59:57.572 --> 59:59.092
[SPEAKER_06]: Rama wants to know what con it is.

01:00:00.925 --> 01:00:03.887
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think it's, I think it's Anime Central.

01:00:03.947 --> 01:00:04.708
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in Illinois.

01:00:04.728 --> 01:00:05.768
[SPEAKER_10]: That's ASIN.

01:00:05.788 --> 01:00:07.169
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one that we're wanting to go to.

01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:08.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're thinking about going.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:10.111
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big one.

01:00:10.131 --> 01:00:11.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:11.272
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:12.293
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

01:00:12.393 --> 01:00:12.633
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:00:12.653 --> 01:00:14.934
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably too late to get a panel on that and all that stuff.

01:00:14.954 --> 01:00:15.315
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

01:00:15.815 --> 01:00:16.535
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily.

01:00:16.616 --> 01:00:17.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

01:00:17.216 --> 01:00:18.317
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we might have to make that happen.

01:00:18.797 --> 01:00:22.159
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, we could always do the, uh, OLR Hospitality Suite or something silly.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:22.499
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:23.180
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll think of something.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:23.900
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

01:00:24.241 --> 01:00:24.541
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:24.621
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

01:00:25.592 --> 01:00:28.113
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just been playing lots of Brawl What are your thoughts on Brawl?

01:00:28.153 --> 01:00:28.734
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they get it right?

01:00:28.754 --> 01:00:29.714
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it worth the wait?

01:00:29.734 --> 01:00:31.355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd say it's definitely worth the wait

01:00:53.274 --> 01:00:56.536
[SPEAKER_09]: But like really my only frustration is with the online play.

01:00:57.157 --> 01:00:59.818
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just can't freaking connect and play against anyone.

01:01:01.059 --> 01:01:03.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your Wii far away from your Wi-Fi router?

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:07.503
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's only like 10 feet away from it.

01:01:07.924 --> 01:01:08.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, weird.

01:01:09.096 --> 01:01:11.237
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I did play online.

01:01:11.277 --> 01:01:12.518
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten the friends thing to work.

01:01:12.538 --> 01:01:14.119
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try tonight after the show.

01:01:14.959 --> 01:01:23.985
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have heard, or I did play the random people one, which is a little silly because it's just like playing the computer pretty much, except you know somebody real is controlling it.

01:01:24.725 --> 01:01:25.826
[SPEAKER_06]: But it wasn't bad.

01:01:25.866 --> 01:01:27.907
[SPEAKER_06]: It was relatively lag-free, so I was pretty excited.

01:01:28.867 --> 01:01:30.689
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:37.292
[SPEAKER_09]: I just kept on getting error codes and ads saying, and it would just cut me out, saying the transmission has ended or something like that.

01:01:37.312 --> 01:01:38.233
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just like, what the heck?

01:01:38.884 --> 01:01:41.446
[SPEAKER_09]: But I haven't actually tried doing it through friend code, so I don't know.

01:01:41.486 --> 01:01:42.447
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that'll work better.

01:01:42.747 --> 01:01:43.128
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

01:01:44.169 --> 01:01:44.429
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:01:44.469 --> 01:01:46.130
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Osfer?

01:01:47.631 --> 01:01:48.372
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's about it.

01:01:48.752 --> 01:01:48.952
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:50.193
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks so much for the phone call.

01:01:50.634 --> 01:01:51.254
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a good week.

01:01:51.414 --> 01:01:55.598
[SPEAKER_06]: And try to take that Smash Brothers in limitation.

01:01:55.738 --> 01:01:56.999
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't OD on it, okay?

01:01:57.939 --> 01:01:58.160
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:58.660
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:01:58.820 --> 01:01:59.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

01:02:00.401 --> 01:02:00.682
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:02:00.702 --> 01:02:00.902
[SPEAKER_09]: See you.

01:02:01.863 --> 01:02:02.283
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:04.329
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.

01:02:04.369 --> 01:02:05.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for your calls.

01:02:05.629 --> 01:02:06.990
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you didn't get through tonight, don't worry.

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:08.010
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always next week.

01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:10.252
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can always leave us a voicemail.

01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:12.232
[SPEAKER_06]: We do play the voicemails once in a while.

01:02:12.353 --> 01:02:16.074
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we didn't play them tonight, but we'll probably get to some more next week.

01:02:16.094 --> 01:02:17.915
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR whenever we're not live.

01:02:18.555 --> 01:02:20.396
[SPEAKER_06]: So you said you had some last-minute stories, Loki.

01:02:20.416 --> 01:02:22.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, real quick here.

01:02:22.677 --> 01:02:23.198
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two things.

01:02:24.858 --> 01:02:28.860
[SPEAKER_03]: That show Dexter you may have heard about.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.522
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually now starting to, I guess, replay it on the CVS.

01:02:33.863 --> 01:02:42.568
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about a serial killer who, instead of going around killing other people, he goes around killing serial killers.

01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:44.829
[SPEAKER_03]: So they kind of fight his urge.

01:02:45.209 --> 01:02:48.631
[SPEAKER_03]: It's currently running Showtime, and apparently they're making a game from it.

01:02:49.571 --> 01:02:50.992
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of interesting.

01:02:51.772 --> 01:02:53.914
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is the game Turning Point.

01:02:54.374 --> 01:02:59.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the reviews haven't been too good for it, and according to Turning Point's CEO...

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:03.192
[SPEAKER_03]: of the company Spark Unlimited.

01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:08.796
[SPEAKER_03]: He's quoted that Turning Point is too high concept for reviewers.

01:03:09.876 --> 01:03:14.419
[SPEAKER_03]: They just... It wasn't for the critics, apparently.

01:03:14.919 --> 01:03:26.907
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more, I guess, a game that was never meant for core gamers that is meant for those who aren't wanting to look at a game with a critical eye, I guess.

01:03:28.288 --> 01:03:28.548
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:33.616
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically saying that the game reviewers don't know how to review his game.

01:03:34.136 --> 01:03:36.257
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was supposed to be crappy, I guess.

01:03:37.257 --> 01:03:37.597
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:03:38.137 --> 01:03:38.378
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

01:03:40.839 --> 01:03:41.279
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:03:41.899 --> 01:03:45.180
[SPEAKER_03]: I know his next game that they're doing, was it Legendary?

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.321
[SPEAKER_03]: That one that's by Gamecock, I guess?

01:03:47.421 --> 01:03:48.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Legendary the Box?

01:03:49.082 --> 01:03:50.102
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's just Legendary.

01:03:53.904 --> 01:03:54.764
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

01:03:56.545 --> 01:03:56.925
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:03:57.386 --> 01:04:00.107
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that is going to do it, I guess, for tonight's Last Minute Stories.

01:04:00.427 --> 01:04:01.327
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for now.

01:04:01.567 --> 01:04:01.947
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:04:02.027 --> 01:04:05.288
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:05.788 --> 01:04:09.269
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting Independent Radio.

01:04:09.329 --> 01:04:10.129
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are awesome.

01:04:10.629 --> 01:04:13.330
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:15.990
[SPEAKER_06]: And then actually, we're breaking form a little bit tonight.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:19.151
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one more story that's very important that we want to do at the very, very end.

01:04:19.431 --> 01:04:21.872
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:22.232
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:51.669
[SPEAKER_03]: my final thought is I want to finish Space Emissary mode this week and god damn it I wish my 360 the other one I'm fixing fucking works because it's three ringed and been fixed and three ringed and sort of been fixed for weeks now now it's three ringed right now so I have to heat it up again and I think it's just broken so but I've done so many mods to it that I kind of want it to be fixed because it'll look like a Frankenstein's monster when I'm done this is a long ass final thought

01:04:53.459 --> 01:04:57.424
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought Say no to bullshit

01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:15.504
[SPEAKER_06]: Really good final thought, appreciate that.

01:05:16.144 --> 01:05:30.638
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to close tonight on this, and I hate to end the show on such a downer, but it is very important to acknowledge, and I'm sure if you have an internet connection you've heard about it this week, we have to acknowledge the passing of Gary Gygax, which happened this week.

01:05:30.978 --> 01:05:34.582
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might not know the name, but you definitely know the legacy he left behind.

01:05:34.942 --> 01:05:37.965
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons and TSR.

01:05:38.485 --> 01:05:43.111
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's face it, without Dungeons & Dragons, you would not have role-playing games like you have today.

01:05:43.191 --> 01:05:47.797
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, think about all the games that were inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:56.288
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about everything from old school games like Ultima and the actual Dungeons & Dragons games that were on, you know, the Apple IIe and all that.

01:05:57.339 --> 01:06:01.642
[SPEAKER_06]: and to everything that we have new today, the Final Fantasies of the world, the Warcrafts.

01:06:02.023 --> 01:06:09.068
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you've actually played D&D, there actually are a lot of similarities between a huge game like World of Warcraft and this.

01:06:09.548 --> 01:06:12.971
[SPEAKER_06]: So unfortunately, he did pass away this week at the age of 69.

01:06:14.412 --> 01:06:18.575
[SPEAKER_06]: We do want to acknowledge the importance that this man had on the gaming industry.

01:06:18.991 --> 01:06:47.602
[SPEAKER_06]: and certainly we not only want to dedicate everything we've done tonight to his memory but we thought we'd close a little bit again kind of breaking form a little bit we thought we'd close tonight with a song because moments of silence are kind of awkward on podcasts so we thought we'd instead play a song and this song is from a game that was definitely you could say directly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons it's the theme to Neverwinter Nights and while we play this song just maybe tip your hat bow your head

01:06:48.228 --> 01:06:52.890
[SPEAKER_06]: Say some final words for Gary Gygax, the creator of Dungeons & Dragons, who passed this week at the age of 69.

01:07:18.986 --> 01:07:20.068
Thanks for watching!

01:08:05.394 --> 01:08:06.456
