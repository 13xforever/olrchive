7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Mojo.
14000	19000	Tonight, March 9th, 2008, is Smash Bros malfunctioning on some Wii's?
19000	23000	More car and track information is released for Gran Turismo 5.
23000	27000	Spore gets a port to an unlikely gaming platform.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	43000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and, wait for it, the gamer lifestyle.
43000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49000	50000	Hi.
50000	51000	And how are you, Miss Summers?
51000	52000	Meaty.
52000	54000	Meaty? Mmm, so meaty.
54000	56000	What exactly are you eating tonight?
56000	61000	I'm eating a protein-style cheeseburger from In-N-Out.
61000	62000	Mmm, yum.
62000	63000	This isn't my mic.
63000	66000	Yeah, I think you have Loki's. That's alright.
66000	67000	Hey.
67000	70000	You know, the technical difficulties just couldn't end with last week.
70000	71000	I feel better.
71000	73000	Alright, there you go. You feel complete now?
73000	74000	I do.
74000	77000	Yeah, well let me introduce Tech Master Loki real quick and then we'll talk about last week.
77000	80000	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, now with proper mic.
80000	81000	Yes, I have the proper mic.
81000	82000	How are you, Loki?
82000	87000	Good. I'm just untangling the mic on the mixing board so I don't pull it and it turns all the knobs on there.
87000	94000	I know. We have to be like ultra, like, make sure everything is in its proper place tonight after last week.
94000	98000	Alright, so yeah, I'm sure you guys all heard the epilogue at the end of last week's Part A.
98000	102000	Those of you guys that were listening on the podcast anyway, those of you guys that are live tonight, Sunday,
102000	106000	joining us in our chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com, nothing happened for you.
106000	109000	You guys heard the show as always, but unfortunately the folks who listened to us on the podcast,
109000	115000	they didn't get Part B last week because right after it was done and we were in our final segment,
115000	120000	the computer got unplugged, I made a boo-boo and zapped the temp file so we couldn't really save it.
120000	124000	Now, what's kind of cool though is that one of our listeners, this is J100Matt,
124000	131000	actually was able to retrieve the audio directly out of the Justin TV cam, but the quality kind of stinks
131000	136000	because it's all based off the iSight cam that we use for Justin TV, which is a completely different computer.
136000	141000	It's actually a laptop, and you can't really hear Jamie at all because Jamie, well, I mean you can,
141000	146000	but she's just really quiet because she's the furthest away from it, and yeah, I don't know.
146000	148000	That may be a positive or a minus depending.
148000	150000	Jamie, rebuttal.
153000	154000	No.
154000	155000	All right.
157000	161000	Loki gets smacked with a large trout or whatever the old MIRC thing is.
161000	170000	Anyhow, so yeah, we'll release the kind of cruddy audio part B like on our Facebook and MySpace and all that stuff.
170000	174000	I'll try to get that up tomorrow just for those folks that really want to hear it,
174000	178000	but for the rest of you guys, it's just another broken show, what can we say?
178000	182000	But we're hoping tonight is working.
182000	183000	We're back to our normal selves.
183000	185000	It's a new month.
185000	187000	The weather's getting warmer again.
187000	190000	We're off to a good start because the network is actually working the way it's supposed to.
190000	193000	We didn't have to jerry-rig a whole second network setup,
193000	198000	so we're hoping we are ready to talk games for our full part A and part B tonight,
198000	203000	so I will shut up and turn it over to DarkSakura who will talk about her gaming week.
203000	207000	My gaming week was almost nonexistent except for, of course, Ragnarok
207000	215000	because I've been very busy trying to get a few things ready and had a few hang-ups come in the way,
215000	219000	but I think I'm going to actually be able to play more stuff next week.
219000	222000	That's good. Sometimes real life gets in the way of gaming. That's okay.
222000	225000	Sometimes people can't hold the controller.
225000	227000	Gotcha.
227000	230000	Well then, Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week?
230000	232000	It was okay.
232000	239000	I played Orange Box on the PC because I have had it for a while and I haven't actually tried it.
239000	244000	It looks nice on the PC, but it's exactly the same.
244000	256000	So, yeah. Mainly Portal, because that's actually all I got, so it's just Portal.
256000	261000	And then I've been playing a little bit of Smash Bros. Brawl.
261000	270000	I'm 30% way through the subspace emissary, so that's pretty fun.
270000	277000	And then, what else? I think I may have played some Patapon. That's about it.
277000	280000	Tell me a little bit more about Patapon because I was reading some stuff about it
280000	283000	and it actually sounds like something I kind of want to play. Sounds kind of cool.
283000	287000	It's kind of neat. It's basically, I mean, sort of, it's not really a rhythm music game,
287000	293000	but you have to keep rhythm with these drums and depending on what four-note sequence you play,
293000	295000	they will do different things.
295000	302000	Like if you have an attack sequence, you have march forward, retreat, that kind of stuff.
302000	308000	So you just kind of strategize with that and keep in time at the same time.
308000	313000	The other thing that I did wasn't really playing games, but I got to view a lot of games
313000	318000	and that was we had our Eidos rep come out and talk to us a bit about the stuff that they covered
318000	321000	during Destination PlayStation.
321000	326000	And we got to see some really cool stuff including an unreleased trailer for Tomb Raider Legends,
326000	333000	or not Tomb Raider Legends, Tomb Raider Underworld with gameplay footage on it and it looks awesome.
333000	338000	Absolutely awesome. They did some new motion capturing for everything.
338000	345000	Really? Because, pardon my skepticism, but I have failed to get excited about Tomb Raider in about ten years.
345000	347000	It's about as awesome as Uncharted, maybe.
347000	352000	I don't know. I'm not that excited about Uncharted, but it really does look good.
352000	358000	I can't get excited about Tomb Raider because it's just not my thing, but it looks good.
358000	363000	I don't know. I wouldn't buy it though, but it looks good for people who like Tomb Raider.
363000	365000	Not me. I don't like Tomb Raider.
365000	369000	I like throwing her off a cliff and killing her and that's about it.
369000	372000	But I'm sure you can do that and it will look much nicer.
372000	375000	So that's it.
375000	380000	Other cool stuff I saw. There's a game. I hope I get the title right.
380000	384000	I think it's called Little Ninjas and it looks really cool.
384000	389000	It's kind of a cross between almost like Okami and...
389000	393000	I don't really know what else. Maybe Pirates vs. Ninjas or something like that.
393000	396000	Volleyball or Dodgeball or whatever.
396000	399000	Very cute little ninjas and they're fighting bad guys and stuff like that.
399000	402000	All kind of cel-shaded. It looks really neat.
402000	405000	So that will be coming out next year, unfortunately.
405000	411000	And then I got to see some gameplay of the new Death Junior that they're doing for the Wii.
411000	413000	It actually looks pretty good.
413000	418000	Hopefully it won't suck like the rest of them, but I'm pretty confident.
418000	420000	And then the one I was kind of excited about for the...
420000	423000	Wait, I have a quick question. I thought Death Junior was a Konami license.
423000	425000	Why is Eidos doing it now?
425000	427000	Different publisher. It's the company owned...
427000	431000	Oh, gotcha. Sorry. Yeah, that's right. Konami just published someone else's game.
431000	434000	I wonder why they decided not to do this one.
434000	440000	I don't know. Maybe the last two sucked for them and they dropped the publisher and Eidos picked them up. Who knows.
440000	446000	I also got to see some pretty cool footage of Gauntlet for the DS.
446000	450000	That's going to be cool. I wish they'd put it on live.
450000	456000	But it's like a cross between the original Gauntlet and Gauntlet Legends.
456000	462000	It's still top-down like the original Gauntlet, but it's all 3D and stuff like Legends was.
462000	469000	The cool thing about it though, four-player Wi-Fi co-op and there's voice chat involved with that as well.
469000	473000	So at least they're doing that right. So that'll be a pretty good purchase.
473000	478000	I've got to catch up on some comments from Chat Room because we have lots of good stuff tonight.
478000	481000	chat.orangelaunchrader.com if you want to join us.
481000	487000	DKJunior92 says, Uncharted is way better than Tomb Raider and you can kill him.
487000	491000	DMN says, Gauntlet DS equals sex. I will make love to it.
491000	496000	GS68 says, too many gaming publications credit the publisher and not the developer.
496000	499000	And you're right. I just made the same mistake. I'm sorry.
499000	507000	It's okay. Then there's some other cool stuff I wasn't aware of like the series and stuff like Shell Shock 2 they showed us.
507000	513000	Which I guess that's like a survivor horror game set in NOM. It's like Condemned in NOM, I guess.
513000	520000	And then there's this other Looney Tunes game that was a complete rip-off of Elite Beat Agents.
520000	525000	I mean, completely a rip-off of Elite Beat Agents. Except I don't know about the music though.
525000	528000	The music is like out of Looney Tunes so it's all that orchestrated stuff.
528000	540000	Not necessarily that but I think it did look kind of hard but it's exactly like Elite Beat Agents.
540000	544000	I mean, if you play Elite Beat Agents this will be easy for you.
544000	549000	So that's pretty much it. That was my gaming week. It was kind of exciting though to get to see everything.
549000	558000	And I got to talk to her but she offered us, well at least me and my co-worker, to go tour Eidos.
558000	560000	Let's see if I can drag other people on.
560000	564000	Aren't they going to make you sign all kinds of papers where you can't talk about it here though?
564000	571000	No, they're just like... She was talking about, for example, showing us storyboards for Tomb Raider and stuff like that.
571000	572000	That's cool.
572000	580000	I don't know. All the stuff was pretty much announced. Obviously I don't have the trailer for Tomb Raider Underworld or anything like that.
580000	585000	That's the stuff that wasn't shown. I mean, kind of shown behind closed doors type thing.
585000	591000	I don't know. It looks pretty good. I don't know. Just Cause 2 looks exciting.
591000	596000	But I like the first one so I'm looking forward to those Grand Theft Auto type of games.
596000	599000	Alright. Sounds like there's a lot coming out for you.
599000	606000	Good fourth quarter for them. That's pretty good because Eidos in the past has been a few games.
606000	607000	Been a little bit iffy.
607000	608000	It's been a rough ride.
608000	609000	It's been a rough ride?
609000	610000	Yeah.
610000	611000	Well good. I'm glad to see them getting back on track.
611000	615000	Hey Jamie, I got a question for you because I know you're a fan of Elite Beat Agents, right?
615000	616000	Yeah.
616000	619000	What do you think about the whole Looney Tunes franchise completely knocking it off?
619000	621000	I think it's stupid.
621000	623000	You think it's stupid? Too much of a good thing?
623000	624000	Well...
624000	625000	It's a copy of a copy?
625000	630000	Yeah. I think that if they were going to do something it would be better for them to do something original.
630000	634000	But who knows? I mean obviously it can't be just a straight up rip off, right Loki?
634000	636000	It's got to have some original stuff in it.
636000	641000	Basically what it does is it recreates the different cartoons. Like very famous cartoon scenes or whatever.
641000	645000	And so you're playing the music though with the cartoon.
645000	647000	That's kind of cool.
647000	649000	Oh okay. That might actually be kind of neat.
649000	653000	I mean if you've got like the whole thing going on there where the cartoon's going on.
653000	658000	Because Elite Beat Agents is kind of like that in a way, but it's different.
658000	666000	It just kind of controls exactly the same. Like if you looked at the interface and how the different spots where you tap and stuff, it looks exactly the same.
666000	671000	And who knows? I haven't looked at the developer. Maybe it's the same developer. You never know.
671000	675000	Well GS68 in our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com, sums it up.
675000	678000	Looney Tunes Oh and Don, do not want...
678000	681000	That's what a GS68 says in our chat.
681000	685000	Going on to my gaming week, I've been playing lots of World of Warcraft.
685000	687000	Because I'm addicted.
687000	690000	And our guild has been just tearing the shit out of Karazhan.
690000	693000	Which is our new thing is that we've been raiding Karazhan.
693000	695000	Trying to slowly clear our way through it.
695000	697000	And I think we're doing pretty well for a group of noobs.
697000	699000	I think we've cleared like seven of the bosses.
699000	701000	So we're almost there.
701000	706000	Also in other gaming news, of course, I also played the hell out of Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
706000	708000	When did we get that? Wednesday?
708000	711000	So we were lucky enough to get it a couple days early.
711000	713000	And was playing it a little bit on Justin.tv.
713000	716000	So those of you guys that keep an eye on what we're doing.
716000	718000	Got a little sneak peek on Wednesday.
718000	721000	And goddamn, I'm having a lot of fun with Super Smash.
721000	724000	But now that I can actually understand it, as opposed to the Japanese version, like what's going on.
724000	726000	I'm having a lot of fun.
726000	729000	What I do think is interesting is that whole subspace emissary mode.
729000	731000	Obviously I don't want to spoil a whole lot of what's going on.
731000	735000	But I think what's interesting is that the cutscenes use no dialogue whatsoever.
735000	738000	There's no dialogue whatsoever in the cutscenes.
738000	740000	Everything is more of an emotional reaction.
740000	743000	There's no words.
743000	745000	Which is very interesting.
745000	747000	The whole story is kind of told with the music.
747000	749000	I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. It's just interesting.
749000	751000	It's a cost saving thing.
751000	752000	It is totally a cost saving thing.
752000	757000	So they don't have to pay voice actors and they don't have to pay other voice actors to translate what they're saying.
757000	763000	I gotta say though, I am pretty freaking impressed that it has a pretty fairly fleshed out single player mode.
763000	767000	Melee had its own kind of single player mode that was kind of cool.
767000	772000	And certainly I remember when I played that first world in the single player mode, the Mushroom Kingdom thing,
772000	775000	I was like, they need to do a Mario game just like this on the GameCube.
775000	777000	And of course they never did.
777000	781000	Well, I don't know, Paper Mario on the Wii is kind of rad like that, but I don't know.
781000	785000	But just seeing what they did with the single player mode here and really making it a game.
785000	788000	It's not like the greatest single player game ever.
788000	792000	And you sort of have to really suspend disbelief to make the story work.
792000	796000	Because they really did kind of have to put all these characters in a blender and kind of pull a story out of their butts.
796000	798000	But it works.
798000	804000	It does the fanboy service and that's really what this game is all about.
804000	807000	And I'll tell you what, it's very comprehensive fanboy service.
807000	811000	Because not only do you have all these characters, you have all the stickers.
811000	816000	Which, I mean, I think I got a sticker today for Mouser, one of the bosses in Super Mario 2.
816000	818000	I mean, there's some obscure shit in those things.
818000	822000	Like, I was getting things from Advance Wars I never even heard of because I didn't play a lot of that series.
822000	826000	It's just Nintendo fanboy wet dream, this game is.
826000	830000	And you know what, even if you're not like a Super Nintendo fanboy, it's a great party game.
830000	832000	Which, duh, it's a Wii game.
832000	834000	And the Wii has a lot of great party games and this is no exception.
834000	837000	Because I was playing a little bit, three players the other night.
837000	840000	Which is funny because one of us was on the Wii with Nunchuck.
840000	844000	One of us was on the Wii with Classic Controller and the other one was using a GameCube controller.
844000	846000	So it's kind of fun.
846000	848000	Online mode I haven't gotten to test a whole lot.
848000	851000	Because obviously nobody had it on Wednesday, which is when I did most of my playing.
851000	856000	I tried to add one of our other folks here on Orange Launch Radio who also had the game.
856000	858000	But it wasn't working, I don't know why.
858000	860000	Maybe it wasn't, maybe it wasn't up and running, I don't know.
860000	865000	But I will, I want to point out that we have a friend code thread over on our forums.
865000	867000	I'm going to add everybody on there later today.
867000	874000	And try to maybe bring out Justin.tv this evening and try to fight some folks, Orange Launch Radio listeners.
874000	877000	Yes, and we can use my map if I can swap it with somebody.
877000	880000	Because, you know, I made a cool map.
880000	882000	It's called the Cage Match.
882000	884000	Nice, I see what you did there.
884000	889000	Alright, let's see, what else do I want to talk about in my gaming week?
889000	891000	Really quickly, I want to mention Trigger Heart Excellica.
891000	894000	Because I think a lot of people totally skipped this game.
894000	896000	Because it was an Xbox Live Arcade release.
896000	902000	But I'll tell you what, if you like your Japanese shooters, this is as cliche of a Japanese shooter as they come.
902000	905000	I mean, this is, which is a good thing for the Xbox 360.
905000	910000	Because, you know, I think about, hmm, what good like Japanese influenced shooter games are there on the Xbox 360?
910000	912000	And you know what, I come up short.
912000	914000	So Trigger Heart Excellica certainly fills a void.
914000	918000	It's actually based off a arcade game, which I hadn't heard of.
918000	921000	Because I don't play a lot of games in these types of series.
921000	923000	I had it on soundtrack, so I knew it existed.
923000	924000	But it's fun.
924000	926000	I mean, bullets everywhere.
926000	928000	I mean, like your typical Japanese shooter.
928000	930000	Bullets everywhere.
930000	932000	You play a lot of Japanese shooters?
932000	933000	Dark Sakura?
933000	934000	Do you play one?
934000	935000	I did.
935000	937000	Have you ever heard of this one, Trigger Heart Excellica?
937000	938000	Yes.
938000	939000	Oh, it's good times.
939000	945000	If you like that, I was going to say in April there's Castle of Shikigami 3 is coming out in the Wii.
945000	947000	So, that would be another good one.
947000	950000	I think it's definitely worth a look, Trigger Heart Excellica.
950000	953000	I did not spend the money on the full purchase, but I might later on.
953000	958000	Now I'm kind of at the point with Xbox 360 arcade games where like either I'm going to buy the damn thing when it comes right out.
958000	960000	I'm not going to buy it.
960000	965000	Or I'm going to wait for them to do a price reduction because now they've shown that they're willing to do that later.
965000	967000	I bought a bunch of tracks on Rock Band this week.
967000	968000	I'm like, what?
968000	973000	Because I, well, I bought a bunch of the older stuff because I wanted some other...
973000	977000	I left it in my work now, and we have it all set up there so we can play at any time.
977000	987000	I'm actually buying the official, like, well someone made them their official drum silencer thing so the drums aren't so loud.
987000	991000	I tried making my own out of mouse pads.
991000	997000	The funny thing about mouse pads is they soak up super glue pretty easy so it doesn't stick very well.
997000	1003000	So, I'm ripping those off and then trying these official ones out.
1003000	1012000	Because while they stuck, they were working pretty good, but it's just, you know, after you hit them about 20 times, they fell right off.
1012000	1017000	Oh well.
1017000	1020000	Alright.
1020000	1023000	I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my gaming week that I want to talk about.
1023000	1024000	I don't think there is.
1024000	1025000	I think that's really it.
1025000	1027000	Obviously Smash Brothers took a large chunk of my time.
1027000	1031000	As I'm sure for many of you out there who own a Wii, it's taking up a lot of your time as well.
1031000	1035000	I love the demos that they have for the virtual console games.
1035000	1040000	I'd laugh though because I was just, you know, they show you how long the demo is for each one.
1040000	1041000	Ice Climbers, 40 seconds.
1041000	1043000	That's all you get to play of Ice Climbers is 40 seconds.
1043000	1045000	But you can do a lot in 40 seconds in Ice Climbers.
1045000	1048000	40 seconds is long enough to beat the first level.
1048000	1050000	I thought the demos were a nice touch.
1050000	1052000	I was kind of hoping you would unlock more.
1052000	1053000	I don't know if you do yet.
1053000	1053000	I do.
1053000	1054000	Do you?
1054000	1055000	Yeah.
1055000	1057000	Oh, I haven't seen, because one of my friends marathoned it last night.
1057000	1059000	I haven't seen if he unlocked anything else.
1059000	1060000	I imagine you have to unlock a couple others.
1060000	1067000	I have to look at my Japanese one too because I've got, I think, Mother 2 or Mother 3.
1067000	1069000	Not Mother 3, but Mother 2 I think is still on there.
1069000	1070000	Huh.
1070000	1073000	That may be cool because that means we might have Earthbound on ours.
1073000	1074000	No.
1074000	1075000	Damn it.
1075000	1076000	That was exclusive for Japan.
1076000	1077000	Alright.
1077000	1078000	Well then we should get something exclusive.
1078000	1080000	That's not fair.
1080000	1081000	Nintendo.
1081000	1082000	Alright.
1082000	1083000	That's, I mean...
1083000	1084000	Metal Gear Solid.
1084000	1089000	It's kind of shown though that they can't, I mean, they can do a virtual console demo.
1089000	1091000	Time limited, but it works, right?
1091000	1095000	Yeah, they're just assholes, that's all.
1095000	1096000	Alright.
1096000	1098000	Anyhow, let's see.
1098000	1101000	Let's get to tonight's housekeeping before we get to tonight's news.
1101000	1104000	And I guess I already said the one thing I wanted to say on housekeeping tonight.
1104000	1109000	We do have a friend code thread going on on the forums at orangelaunchradio.com.
1109000	1115000	So we will be having some OL Army tournaments and things like that because, you know, lots of people love Smash Brothers.
1115000	1116000	I know lots of our listeners are into this series.
1116000	1118000	I'm sure tons of you have picked up the game.
1118000	1120000	So check it out at orangelaunchradio.com.
1120000	1121000	Click on the forums.
1121000	1124000	And you can probably get 64 friend codes all on that list.
1124000	1128000	And make sure if you are adding people on Brawl that you're also adding them on your system.
1128000	1130000	Just in case we want to swap levels around.
1130000	1132000	Because as far as I'm aware, I'm not sure if...
1132000	1136000	You can drop them onto, you know, the SD memory cards.
1136000	1142000	But I don't know if those things are linked to a certain system or not because Nintendo is an asshole.
1142000	1147000	So, you know, they really don't want, you know, anything to work correctly.
1147000	1153000	So, you know, in a perfect world you should be able to drop it onto an SD memory card and throw it up on the internet and people can download it and that kind of crap.
1153000	1156000	But something tells me it won't work that way.
1156000	1163000	Because they're afraid that someone is going to make a penis out of blocks or something in fucking Smash Brothers.
1163000	1166000	We'll save that for later this week.
1166000	1167000	Alright.
1167000	1172000	DMN wants me to plug something he's doing too which is the OLR March Madness.
1172000	1175000	We'll be talking more about that during the live only bonus segment tonight.
1175000	1183000	But if you want to participate in choosing the best video game of all time, as chosen by our listeners, check out our forums as well in the STFU forum.
1183000	1188000	That's DMN's show and there's more information on how you can send your votes in and all that good stuff.
1188000	1191000	So, are we ready to get into some gaming news?
1191000	1192000	Why not?
1192000	1193000	Alright, I think so.
1193000	1194000	Why don't you start us off, Logie?
1194000	1199000	Alright, this isn't a big surprise because the same thing happened in Japan when Smash Brothers was released there.
1199000	1211000	Some Wii systems are having trouble reading Smash Brothers Brawl because, first off, it's the first dual layer Wii game on the system.
1211000	1218000	And there was an update, I believe, on the disc to update your system to be able to play those dual layer discs.
1218000	1228000	And because of that, it takes a little bit more refined laser to see the data on the disc.
1228000	1235000	And they're claiming that some of the Wii systems are kind of dusty and dirty, so they will not be able to play Brawl.
1235000	1245000	So if you run into that problem, you're supposed to send your system in to Nintendo and they will fix the problem or clean your disc dry or something like that.
1245000	1247000	Vacuum out the insides of your Wii or something?
1247000	1249000	Something to that effect.
1249000	1255000	Do you think there might be any, I mean, you're the type of, you know, you're a homebrew kind of guy, do you think there's any home remedies that someone could try that...
1255000	1259000	I mean, obviously, you know, don't void your warranty or whatever.
1259000	1264000	But if somebody out there happens to be getting this problem, is there anything they could try that wouldn't damage their Wii?
1264000	1271000	It'd be hard because that disc drive's kind of funky. Maybe like a CD cleaner or something like that, or DVD cleaner.
1271000	1272000	How effective are those CD cleaner things?
1272000	1277000	I don't think they're very effective. It's just basically a CD with brushes on it, I mean.
1277000	1281000	No, no, I was just thinking, does the Wii even play CDs? It doesn't, does it?
1281000	1282000	No.
1282000	1286000	I don't know. I don't know why I was thinking that. I'm just kind of like, I don't think it plays CDs at all.
1286000	1295000	Well, I don't know. My system wasn't dusty at all, and I mean, to be honest, there isn't really a lot of places for it to get dusty.
1295000	1303000	I mean, that drive isn't really open that much, and there's just, there's, you know, kind of some sort of, like, brushes on it.
1303000	1304000	Yeah, there's little microbrushes on them.
1304000	1308000	Yeah, microbrushes on it, so it does a pretty good job of keeping it clean.
1308000	1316000	But, I mean, if you're maybe a chain smoker, and you're just like, take a hit off this Wii, you know, and stuff like that, I mean, maybe, maybe then your Wii's kind of fucked up.
1316000	1318000	Trying to store some weed in your Wii?
1318000	1324000	Yeah, you're trying to, like, fill the Wii with smoke or something, and I don't know, maybe that will cause it to break, but...
1324000	1326000	You bust it open and take a shot back after it.
1326000	1343000	Really, there isn't a whole lot of, you know, intake. I mean, there's, like, a tiny little fan in that thing anyways, and I don't really see how there could be a lot of dust sitting on your laser, unless you're putting in discs that have been sitting out in the air and just, like, are caked with dust and you throw it in your system.
1343000	1348000	Then that's your own damn fault. Either way, it's probably your own damn fault that they don't play, so...
1348000	1369000	That's pretty much it. And Nintendo, of course, they don't want you trying to fix it yourself, but I don't know, they have a process, I guess, you can fill out a form on Nintendo's website for sending your system in to get it, you know, cleaned, I guess.
1369000	1385000	I want to mention this comment in chat. It's completely random, but when you talk about smoke, I couldn't help but think about the Rock Band Stage Kit. Maybe you don't want to use too much of that around your Wii, but according to SSJ100Matt in chat, he says, Loki, apparently the Rock Band Stage Kit doesn't hook up to the Wii.
1385000	1403000	Wrong, it does. See, here's why. Because it doesn't have anything to do with the 360 or the Wii itself, it just hooks up to audio cables, so in theory, you could throw it onto your stereo system and it would work just fine. That's how it's able to work with both systems.
1403000	1411000	So if I want to get some of my ABBA karaoke CDs and put them on my CD player and use the Rock Band Stage Kit to do, like, an epic version of Chikikita, I could do that?
1411000	1412000	Yes, you can.
1412000	1416000	That would be cheap.
1416000	1428000	Alright, also, speaking of epic on your Wii, we love it when new channels come out for the Wii. Too bad this wasn't for us. It's for the folks in Japan. It's the Terribinotomo channel. That would be TV Friend.
1428000	1443000	The TV Friend channel came out on the Wii this week. It's basically, like, imagine the TV Guide channel on American TV. That's kind of what they're getting on the Wii, hence why they say it may not come out here, because of the fact that, you know, here in America, on your cable, you already have a TV Guide channel.
1443000	1444000	It is pretty cool, though.
1444000	1450000	And, you know, we have TV Guide and all that stuff. And plus now with TiVo and, you know, cable's got it built in and all that stuff.
1450000	1467000	The thing about this, though, that was really cool, at least from the video that I saw of it, is that you can look at multiple days, so you can see what's on, you know, a whole week. Usually some of those, you know, you have to kind of keep progressing hour by hour and kind of, you know, moving along the thing to see what's on the next day and stuff like that.
1467000	1473000	This, you can, it'll be like a whole 3D thing and it'll turn it to the side and you can select different days, like, out and stuff like that.
1473000	1476000	That's kind of cool. Does it have a globe I can spin?
1476000	1477000	No.
1477000	1482000	Because that was the best part of the forecast channel and the news channel, was the spinning globe with the, you know, music. I love the music and the weather channel.
1482000	1487000	But, you know, we could go to the grocery store and buy a TV Guide, too, if we wanted an alternative.
1487000	1490000	We could, but that's money. And then I have to read.
1490000	1491000	This is free.
1491000	1492000	I'm just kidding.
1492000	1493000	So is the internet.
1493000	1499000	So are you anti-TV friend channel? You do not want to be TV friend's friend?
1499000	1506000	I don't think that it's necessary. I'm glad that they have it over there, but we don't really need it here. It'd be neat, but...
1506000	1510000	Couldn't you say the same thing about the news channel, though? And the forecast channel, really?
1510000	1517000	Is that, you know, you can get all that shit on the internet or you can, you know, watch the nightly news or you can, I don't know, read a newspaper.
1517000	1520000	It just depends on what you use more.
1520000	1521000	I guess that's true.
1521000	1523000	Now, did you see the other cool thing you can do with this?
1523000	1524000	What?
1524000	1531000	When you find your channel or whatever, you can actually use your Wii Remote as a universal remote with your TV.
1531000	1537000	I know. I was going to get to that, but that's all right. No. Yeah, the Wii Mode is going to be like a universal remote.
1537000	1542000	You can also change channels, do the volume and all that stuff. You can switch between Wii and TV inputs.
1542000	1546000	But it's some type of, like, hack that you use with the sensor bar.
1546000	1557000	Basically, I think what it does is it, I don't know if it causes the IR to bounce off of the sensor bar and bounce off your head or something like that.
1557000	1563000	But when I say hack, it's an official Nintendo thing. It's not like, you know, people are hacking their systems to do it.
1563000	1565000	It's a Nintendo-endorsed hack.
1565000	1570000	So that's kind of neat, though, that they're hacking their own stuff to do weird purposes.
1570000	1573000	I don't know why. That strikes me as so amusing, but it does.
1573000	1574000	So there you go.
1574000	1584000	Also, what's kind of interesting, you can stamp programs that you're interested in and then you can share them with either other Wii users or you can send them to Wii Friends.
1584000	1588000	And Nintendo calculates popularity scores based on what's been bookmarked.
1588000	1590000	So, kind of interesting.
1590000	1594000	I do like the fact that they are kind of trying to turn the Wii into a one-stop shop.
1594000	1600000	Even though news and forecast and, you know, TV and all that is something you can get on the computer anyway,
1600000	1605000	I kind of think it's a neat idea to have it, like, all right there on your TV. It's interesting.
1605000	1611000	And, I mean, I know it's something that's available out there right now and other things, but it's free.
1611000	1615000	So, I mean, even if you don't use it, it's at least there for you.
1615000	1616000	Yeah.
1616000	1621000	Same with, like, the news channel. I don't read it at all, but, you know, if you want to, you can.
1621000	1627000	It's better, too, to have more stuff to fill your little blank TV screens with on your Wii.
1627000	1630000	Doesn't that feel good, to fill in those screens?
1630000	1634000	No, I'm almost out of memory on my Wii system.
1634000	1637000	What happens when we run out of space? Because you only get four screens to play with.
1637000	1641000	I'm like, I'm seriously, I probably have maybe ten screens left. Really?
1641000	1648000	Yeah, you have to delete stuff or, and then when you run out of space on the actual unit, you have to put stuff on SD memory cards.
1648000	1651000	I bet you anything Nintendo is going to do something about the memory space this winter.
1651000	1653000	They have to for all this WiiWare stuff coming out.
1653000	1655000	Right. I don't think so.
1655000	1657000	No, they're stubborn bastards. They won't do it.
1657000	1660000	Yeah, Frisbee says external hard drive channel.
1660000	1663000	External hard drive channel?
1663000	1668000	Exactly. The SD card management channel, even though it's in the system.
1668000	1670000	But something that can, like, just...
1670000	1675000	It would not be that hard to have the Wii read off the SD card just like it does its own internal memory.
1675000	1680000	Well, if you want to do something even more annoying, then you can also make this free or possibly as a service.
1680000	1690000	You can make it like one of those Yahoo internet drives where you can store stuff on a web server and download it to your system that way.
1690000	1695000	I know Nintendo says, hey, you can go in the shop channel any time and redownload this stuff for free.
1695000	1697000	You don't have to pay for it again.
1697000	1701000	But I'm like, I don't know if it's just me. I think the Wii shop channel is slow and clunky.
1701000	1702000	It's slow as shit.
1702000	1704000	Like, I would not have to want to go in there every time.
1704000	1709000	It brings me back to the days of the Super Nintendo and 20-
1709000	1710000	Do it.
1710000	1713000	Yeah, it brings me back to the days of Prodigy, okay?
1713000	1716000	That's what the Wii shop channel feels like is Prodigy online.
1716000	1718000	Eww, blow blow.
1718000	1721000	I know.
1721000	1723000	You want to know a true story about Prodigy?
1723000	1724000	What?
1724000	1725000	Prodigy is where it all started for me, dude.
1725000	1728000	If I did not have Prodigy, the show would not exist.
1728000	1731000	That was my first gateway drug to the internet was Prodigy.
1731000	1734000	I remember Prodigy.
1734000	1740000	I used to have on the forums, I actually had a Nintendo help thread and I would help kids with their video games.
1740000	1742000	I was like 12 or 13 when this was all going on.
1742000	1748000	One time on Prodigy, we decided, me and my friend, there's a joke channel or something like that and you can submit jokes.
1748000	1751000	So we thought it would be funny to submit really shitty jokes.
1751000	1757000	And we wasted like an hour doing that and then my mom got the phone bill and it was like hundreds of dollars.
1757000	1765000	When they introduced Prodigy Chat, I got in big trouble because Prodigy Chat was a plus channel and my parents got like a $90 bill.
1765000	1767000	Needless to say, I wasn't able to use Prodigy for a little while.
1767000	1769000	Oh yes, Dark Sakura.
1769000	1776000	Well, I started off on AOL but also after my first year on that, I ended up being a chat host for Cartoon Network.
1776000	1778000	So I got a free account.
1778000	1784000	I had an overhead account for a long, long time and then when I quit doing that, they didn't change me back for years.
1784000	1790000	So I actually spent like maybe five or six years not being charged for AOL.
1790000	1793000	AOL was always kind of the devil to people on Prodigy.
1793000	1800000	And if anyone wants to know who I was, I was CNW Allura for the Cartoon Network chat back in the day.
1800000	1804000	Do you think someone's honestly going to listen to this and be all like, I remember her?
1804000	1809000	Hey, watch. I did a whole bunch on that. So I don't care who knows it was me.
1809000	1814000	Dartitsuyen Chat says, Sky, you wanted to grow up to be a Nintendo game counselor?
1814000	1819000	Dude, wasn't that like all of our dreams in junior high school until we realized...
1819000	1820000	No.
1820000	1822000	Kind of a fancy call center with that guy.
1822000	1823000	Ever.
1823000	1826000	But you could play video games for a living.
1826000	1827000	Yeah.
1827000	1829000	And get paid for it.
1829000	1831000	No.
1831000	1833000	Alright, let's go ahead and move on.
1833000	1835000	I'm trying to help stupid people get through the game.
1835000	1837000	How'd I get more into the jump?
1837000	1840000	Push the B button, or the A button.
1840000	1842000	It's not working.
1842000	1843000	I bet there's...
1843000	1844000	Turn on your system.
1844000	1845000	It is.
1845000	1847000	I bet there were some real dopes that called in. Anyway, sorry.
1847000	1856000	For more Wii news and not AOL or Prodigy, which we, you know, we called... Nevermind.
1856000	1859000	I love that we are on the cutting edge of technology here on this show.
1859000	1862000	Remember Prodigy?
1862000	1864000	Sorry.
1864000	1866000	Comp you suck.
1866000	1868000	I need people who use that.
1868000	1876000	Anyway, Okami Wii is actually getting a later release date than was anticipated.
1876000	1880000	They originally said March 25th that it's going to be April 15th.
1880000	1883000	So, get ready to play it then.
1883000	1886000	Capcom doesn't really want to tell us why.
1886000	1888000	No.
1888000	1892000	Is it? Well, I mean, you know, it's not like there isn't a version of Okami already out there.
1892000	1896000	So, I think a little weight won't kill anybody.
1896000	1901000	I'll tell you why it's not coming out on the 25th, because it's not done. I don't know.
1901000	1909000	You know why games get delayed surprisingly or something? They fail the little seal of approval check and all that stuff.
1909000	1911000	Yeah, the seal of approval of anything.
1911000	1914000	No, but don't the games have to be ok?
1914000	1917000	Xbox 360 games have to go through a Microsoft certification process.
1917000	1920000	Nintendo games have to go through something similar. Maybe it failed.
1920000	1926000	Really? You mean they actually put these shitty Destiny games through that same Nintendo seal of approval?
1926000	1931000	Someone actually ok's this shit to come out?
1931000	1933000	Yeah, that's one.
1933000	1939000	Yes and no. I have heard of the fact that sometimes gaming companies say they don't want these games to come out on their system.
1939000	1940000	I've heard of that happening.
1940000	1947000	But the other thing is that for every Xbox game, you have to refer to the little X button as the guide button.
1947000	1950000	Your A's have to be colored like the A button and all that stuff.
1950000	1953000	Somebody actually goes through and makes sure the game is compliant.
1953000	1958000	So I bet you anything with Okami, somebody missed something and a Playstation 2 character came over and they had to go back and fix it.
1958000	1961000	Oh, I'm glad that they fixed those little details.
1961000	1963000	I have absolutely nothing to back that up.
1963000	1966000	But sometimes these are why games get unexpectedly delayed.
1966000	1970000	And if they're not saying anything about it, you never know.
1970000	1973000	Who cares? I mean, eh.
1973000	1977000	There's nothing coming out in April anyways. At least not in the first half.
1977000	1978000	So it's the only thing.
1978000	1981000	Is the top title of the first half of April now?
1981000	1987000	I'm going over to chat at chat.orangelaundraider.com and just a completely random comment out of thin air.
1987000	1988000	I guess it must have been on another topic.
1988000	1992000	gripper01 in chat says, I'm stuck on the second boss on Lost Odyssey.
1992000	1993000	It's hard.
1993000	1996000	And Lost Odyssey does have some pretty tough bosses in it.
1996000	1997000	But you know what's really funny?
1997000	2001000	You'll notice in my gaming week, as much of a love fest as I was having with Lost Odyssey last week, I didn't even play it.
2001000	2002000	I didn't touch it this week.
2002000	2007000	My roommate comes up to me yesterday and goes, did you stop playing Lost Odyssey?
2007000	2009000	It's like I wanted to see more of it.
2009000	2014000	I can't remember if I played Lost Odyssey or not because I'm still fighting with that fucking 360 that does not want to work.
2014000	2018000	I'm going to throw it away one of these days.
2018000	2021000	No, I do fully intend to go back and play more Lost Odyssey.
2021000	2023000	It's just I got tied up in Hello.
2023000	2027000	I mean, Smash Brothers came out this week and Warcraft Addiction and all that other stuff.
2027000	2030000	Some of my other online games got in the way this week too.
2030000	2033000	Second boss of Lost Odyssey, I'm trying to think.
2033000	2040000	Yeah, you just have to keep casting spells against it.
2040000	2043000	I think it's based on fire, so water spells maybe?
2043000	2047000	Yeah, water spells.
2047000	2048000	I don't remember.
2048000	2050000	And then after you kill the first one, there's a second one that comes.
2050000	2054000	Alright, well let's go ahead and move on with the news.
2054000	2060000	There's another channel coming soon once Mario Kart is released.
2060000	2066000	When you get your copy of Mario Kart, it will actually install a new channel called the Mario Kart Wii Channel.
2066000	2073000	And it will include wonderful things, including an online leaderboard, I believe.
2073000	2079000	Global Friend View allows you to see where your friends are located and their online status.
2079000	2082000	Maybe you can spin that globe, Rob.
2082000	2092000	Spectator Mode, as well as there's going to be some other cool stuff you can do, like being able to download ghost data.
2092000	2097000	Daily Missions, kind of like the mission mode in Mario Kart DS.
2097000	2101000	And, what else? Let's see.
2101000	2104000	That's pretty much it.
2104000	2109000	But I like the fact that you can do Spectator Mode while you're waiting for races and stuff. That's kind of neat.
2109000	2117000	I think it's interesting, Nintendo's strategy here, to create a whole separate channel dedicated to one of their games.
2117000	2119000	I actually think it's kind of a neat idea.
2119000	2123000	You've got to hand it to Nintendo at least for this much.
2123000	2129000	As pretty rad as the Xbox 360 is with its online stuff, it doesn't have a lot like this.
2129000	2137000	With the exception of stuff like Halo 3 that has their very comprehensive website with obscenely detailed game statistics.
2137000	2141000	It's kind of neat to see Nintendo doing something actually integrated on the Wii.
2141000	2146000	Hey, they can't do something integrated on the whole system.
2146000	2151000	I don't care if each one of these games has another channel that adds on to it.
2151000	2155000	That's fine with me, because I'm not playing 20 games at a time.
2155000	2158000	Especially the AAA titles that you know tons of people are getting.
2158000	2162000	I don't know what you guys have heard about the midnight launches from around the country,
2162000	2166000	but just looking on some of the various gaming blogs, talking to one of my friends that was working at one of the stores,
2166000	2168000	it sounds like... packed.
2168000	2171000	It sounds like these midnight sales are absolutely packed for Smash Brothers.
2171000	2177000	Actually, Dan, of course you know my husband manages a game crazy,
2177000	2183000	and he was saying that what was packed was the tournament he ran and not so much the midnight sale.
2183000	2187000	So people were just going for the tournament and didn't even bother to buy the game?
2187000	2188000	Pretty much.
2188000	2189000	That's weird.
2189000	2192000	I don't know. I think he'll pick it up eventually.
2192000	2195000	He said it really thinned out when it came time for the launch.
2195000	2196000	Huh.
2196000	2199000	Maybe it was past all their bedtimes. Maybe they're coming back today.
2199000	2205000	Maybe. I mean, I'd just say it doesn't matter what time they do a launch, pre-order your copy. You'll get it.
2205000	2206000	True.
2206000	2208000	Maybe they didn't have money at the time. Maybe they're just waiting to pick it up later on,
2208000	2211000	because it's not like it's going to be hard to find, I don't think.
2211000	2215000	I hate calling it pre-ordering, because really you're just reserving.
2215000	2216000	It's a deposit.
2216000	2218000	Ordering. Reserve your copy.
2218000	2222000	Let's Have Tea says there were over 300 kids at the one I went to.
2222000	2227000	GS68 says I was at the GameStop in Santa Clara this morning and the line was going around the store.
2227000	2228000	Hmm.
2228000	2231000	Sounds like things are pretty packed.
2231000	2235000	I would say it's definitely Nintendo's version of, you know, it's their Halo.
2235000	2239000	It's their, you know, big, big triple-A title that causes people to come out like this.
2239000	2243000	And they've got some good stuff coming up, you know, with Mario Kart next.
2243000	2246000	I mean, it's not a bad thing to follow.
2246000	2253000	Alright, well anyhow, moving on with some more Wii news, and of course we'll be talking about other systems later on throughout Part A and Part B,
2253000	2255000	but we'll focus on the Wii for a little bit.
2255000	2262000	I want to talk about WiiWare, and one of the new titles that's going to be coming to WiiWare is a survival horror puzzler.
2262000	2266000	Yes, that's right, it's a survival horror puzzler, and that actually sounds kind of rad.
2266000	2268000	It's coming from WayForward Technologies.
2268000	2272000	They made the game Shantae, or Shantae.
2272000	2274000	Shantae is like somebody's name.
2274000	2281000	Shantae on Game Boy Color, and it's a game called Lit, and it's being made for WiiWare.
2281000	2285000	Lit is going to be about this character Jake, and he's trapped in a high school,
2285000	2289000	and there's evil creatures all around the high school, and he's trying to find his girlfriend Rachel.
2289000	2293000	This is WayForward's first original IP since Shantae.
2293000	2300000	Lit is going to have horror elements, boss battles, and the developers are expecting this to be a big game.
2300000	2303000	And the concept art looks kind of neat.
2303000	2308000	I'm curious how a survival horror puzzler plays out, but those are two of my favorite genres,
2308000	2311000	so the marriage of them can't be entirely a bad thing, right Jamie?
2311000	2314000	It's going to have cutscenes where you walk through and you meet a zombie that says,
2314000	2317000	Hey, let's puzzle to get past this door.
2317000	2318000	Is that...
2318000	2319000	Like in Kirby's Avalanche.
2319000	2321000	Or like Puzzle Quest.
2321000	2324000	It's like playing Puyo Puyo.
2324000	2331000	Yes, as if a puzzle quest survival horror game I'm sure would be well accepted.
2331000	2334000	So wait, how would Resident Evil puzzler work?
2334000	2338000	Solve this puzzle or Chainsaw Man is going to come after you?
2338000	2340000	It's like Puzzle Pirates.
2340000	2343000	Silly Rob, there's no Chainsaw Man.
2343000	2344000	Yeah, there is, isn't there?
2344000	2345000	Yeah, hello?
2345000	2346000	This is like the scariest guy in the game.
2346000	2349000	The guy with the chainsaw on the first stage that runs up to you and just chops your head right off.
2349000	2355000	They should totally make another puzzle fighter game and just throw in characters from Resident Evil in there,
2355000	2358000	and you can have Chainsaw Man all chibi style.
2358000	2360000	Yeah, that'd be awesome.
2360000	2364000	We need Silent Hill vs. Resident Evil the fighting game.
2364000	2366000	That'd be rad.
2366000	2370000	Akdefta dares to say that Pac-Man is a survival horror puzzler.
2370000	2376000	I mean, you do have to solve the puzzle of every maze and you are running from ghosts, right?
2376000	2377000	Ba dum bum.
2377000	2379000	Oh!
2379000	2380000	That reminded me of something.
2380000	2381000	What's that?
2381000	2384000	I just noticed this while we were watching Tron last week.
2384000	2387000	That you can see Pac-Man in the background of one of the levels with Sark.
2387000	2388000	End of line.
2388000	2389000	Sorry, I had to mention that.
2389000	2390000	Oh, that's fine.
2390000	2393000	I always appreciate the random Tron reference.
2393000	2397000	I was saying random video game reference, but still.
2397000	2399000	Did anyone pick up Discs of Tron?
2399000	2400000	No.
2400000	2404000	I played the demo and I was like, God damn, this game was cool, and I was seven.
2404000	2406000	I know, right?
2406000	2409000	And it still wasn't as cool as the other one.
2409000	2410000	Yeah.
2410000	2412000	Discs of Tron was better in the movie.
2412000	2414000	Although, I am still all for it.
2414000	2415000	Was that you who said that on the show or Jamie?
2415000	2416000	I remember.
2416000	2418000	Somebody said they should make it a ride at Disneyland.
2418000	2420000	Discs of Tron should be a ride at Disneyland.
2420000	2421000	That's probably Jamie.
2421000	2424000	Will you fall through the floor?
2424000	2427000	I think I was talking about the people who were having the Tron part.
2427000	2429000	Why can't they do it with the Wii?
2429000	2433000	Like, you know, you could use your Wii remote like throwing a Frisbee or something.
2433000	2434000	That would be cool.
2434000	2435000	I know, right?
2435000	2439000	That would be awesome, which is why it will never exist.
2439000	2442000	Alright, let's move on.
2442000	2443000	So, Tron is coming out.
2443000	2445000	No, I'm kidding.
2445000	2447000	How do you suggest a ride for Disneyland?
2447000	2449000	Does Disneyland have a suggestion box?
2449000	2451000	I think you have to be an Imagineer.
2451000	2453000	Who's an Imagineer at Disneyland?
2453000	2455000	We know people that work for Disney.
2455000	2456000	Listen to this program.
2456000	2458000	Because every time Jamie and I talk about our big Disney whoredom.
2458000	2462000	Okay, so like Disney Friends of Orange Lawn's radio, you have to make this happen.
2462000	2463000	We want a Tron experience.
2463000	2466000	I don't care if the movie is like 20 years old.
2466000	2467000	It's still all kinds of rad.
2467000	2468000	I have a Tron shirt.
2468000	2469000	Exactly.
2469000	2470000	Tron is rad.
2470000	2472000	The eighties are coming back.
2472000	2474000	All they'll do is they'll just like,
2474000	2479000	what the trend has been lately is updating their rides with different movies tied to them.
2479000	2482000	You know, like the whole, the old submarine ride.
2482000	2485000	It's now like little Nemos.
2485000	2490000	So, instead of soaring over California, it'll be like soaring over the light cycles or something?
2490000	2491000	Not little Nemos.
2491000	2493000	Finding Nemos like, or Nemos something or other.
2493000	2495000	That would be all kinds of rad if they were placed somewhere.
2495000	2496000	Oh, come on.
2496000	2497000	The submarines needed an overhaul.
2497000	2503000	What they need to do, what they'll do is they'll just like convert over the teacups to, you know, the discs of Tron.
2503000	2504000	You know what?
2504000	2508000	The teacups are like a sacred ride to me, so I almost want to punch you for saying that,
2508000	2512000	but it actually might be kind of cool.
2512000	2516000	SSJ100Matt, in response to how to make rides at Disney in chat, says,
2516000	2519000	Sky, you need a special degree in fun.
2519000	2521000	They didn't offer fun as a major in my college.
2521000	2523000	I'm kind of disappointed.
2523000	2529000	Rob says, Rob2B says, teacups of Tron.
2529000	2530000	Okay, we're getting too random.
2530000	2532000	Please, Jamie, give us a story.
2532000	2534000	Like I said, Tron's coming out on the Nintendo DS.
2534000	2535000	No, I'm kidding.
2535000	2536000	Shut up!
2536000	2540000	Famitsu has said that Tron, I can't do that.
2540000	2541000	Okay.
2541000	2549000	Famitsu reported that Disgaea will be out on the Nintendo DS in Japan,
2549000	2552000	titled Disgaea Prince of the Demon World.
2552000	2556000	There's not much really else about it,
2556000	2565000	but it's been rumored that it's actually a port of the original Disgaea Hour of Darkness.
2565000	2570000	And apparently unlockable in it is the teacups of Tron.
2570000	2574000	Shut up!
2574000	2576000	I guess that's kind of cool, though, Disgaea on the DS,
2576000	2578000	because now you can take it with you everywhere you go.
2578000	2579000	And you can touch them.
2579000	2583000	And in order to level up to 9,999 levels, which is an insane amount,
2583000	2588000	you probably would have to take it with you everywhere you go.
2588000	2602000	The Japanese WeWear promo page has been launched,
2602000	2607000	and they're showing off, I guess, the 11 launch titles that they're going to have for it,
2607000	2612000	including Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Young King, and The Promised Land,
2612000	2618000	Star Soldier R, a remake of Star Soldier, which looks pretty awesome,
2618000	2622000	World Puzzle Mojipitan...
2622000	2623000	I don't even know how to pronounce that.
2623000	2631000	Mojipitan Wii, Pokemon Ranch, Dr. Mario's Virus Buster, which looks kind of neat.
2631000	2634000	I don't know, I guess you shoot blocks or something.
2634000	2635000	I don't know.
2635000	2639000	Or I'm thinking it might just be a port of Dr. Mario that might be playable online.
2639000	2642000	It looks like you're firing something.
2642000	2644000	I don't know.
2644000	2646000	But, cool.
2646000	2649000	Let's see, Marubo Shikaku.
2649000	2651000	I have no idea what that is.
2651000	2657000	Magnetica, which was that rip-off of Zuma.
2657000	2664000	Bomberman, looks like Ookiraku Ping Pong Wii.
2664000	2666000	And Angel's Solitaire.
2666000	2668000	Ooh, hooray, ping pong on the Wii.
2668000	2669000	I'm so excited.
2669000	2670000	That's never been done.
2670000	2673000	And Joy Sound Wii.
2673000	2675000	I have no idea what that is either.
2675000	2677000	Maybe a music-based game for the Wii?
2677000	2678000	I don't know, it makes sense.
2678000	2679000	Maybe.
2679000	2680000	I don't know.
2680000	2684000	But they had some screenshots of some different things.
2684000	2690000	Looks like the Dr. Mario game looks pretty cool.
2690000	2692000	I guess that's Star Soldier, the one that...
2692000	2694000	That middle one is Star Soldier.
2694000	2697000	And then the bottom one's Magnetica.
2697000	2699000	Does the website have any information about...
2699000	2702000	I don't know where you're going to store all this stuff?
2702000	2703000	I don't know.
2703000	2709000	I heard a rumor, though, that Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game was going to take
2709000	2710000	up all your memory.
2710000	2711000	I don't know.
2711000	2712000	It's stupid, though.
2712000	2713000	It's so crazy.
2713000	2716000	Oh my god, that's creepy, that Pokemon game.
2716000	2717000	I know.
2717000	2718000	Oh my god.
2718000	2719000	It's so creepy-looking.
2719000	2723000	But, yeah, some of the other games, like, I don't know what that puzzle game is.
2723000	2727000	There's another one that kind of looks like Sudoku, but it's not.
2727000	2728000	Crystal Chronicles looks good.
2728000	2729000	I don't know.
2729000	2731000	I'm pretty impressed so far.
2731000	2735000	I'm actually sort of looking forward to Star Soldier R, but really there's only one good
2735000	2738000	thing to me that has come out of the Star Soldier franchise.
2738000	2739000	Which is?
2739000	2741000	Star Parodia.
2741000	2742000	You and your Parodius love.
2742000	2743000	No, it's not Parodius.
2743000	2744000	Oh.
2744000	2745000	I thought it was related.
2745000	2750000	This is probably going to end up being a game of the week, but it was a game that was on
2750000	2757000	PC Engine, where you played either as Bomberman, or the ship from Star Soldier, or a flying
2757000	2762000	PC Engine, and the PC Engine would shoot cue cards and CDs.
2762000	2763000	Interesting.
2763000	2767000	Well, another game we know Jamie loves is Pac-Man Versus.
2767000	2771400	Pac-Man Versus was a game where you could, like, its big niche was that you could actually
2771400	2773000	play as the ghost.
2773000	2775800	Well, somebody else has kind of taken an idea like that.
2775800	2778380	Let's take a classic arcade game, but, like, reverse it.
2778380	2780200	And the classic game is Space Invaders.
2780200	2781200	Rad.
2781200	2782600	Now, here's the thing.
2782600	2785000	Space Invaders Extreme is actually kind of sexy.
2785000	2788560	Like, I don't know if you've played it, like, I remember Loki brought on the show.
2788560	2792880	Space Invaders Extreme is kind of like Luminous meets Space Invaders, which is, like, really
2792880	2793880	cool.
2793880	2797740	And so now it's kind of caused a resurgence of Space Invaders, which was always really
2797740	2798740	popular in Japan.
2798740	2802400	I mean, Space Invaders was always way more popular in Japan, probably, than it even was
2802400	2803400	here.
2803400	2806800	What's interesting is that Taito is going to be making an update to the game called
2806800	2809700	Space Invaders Get Even.
2809700	2815560	And in this game, you will be in control of up to 300 Space Invaders, and you get to do
2815560	2817360	death and destruction on human people.
2817360	2819000	Looks like Pikmin, sort of.
2819000	2820240	I guess, yeah.
2820240	2821920	It's been compared to Pikmin and Rampage.
2821920	2824180	Oh, wow, they're all sprite-y.
2824180	2828640	No idea yet if it is an actual game, like, disc game, or if it's a WiiWare game, but
2828640	2834120	either way, I say yes to more Space Invaders nostalgia, because they really did a good
2834120	2837680	job of the extreme, and this looks kind of fun, too.
2837680	2841640	So I'm all for some human killing in Space Invaders.
2841640	2843120	It should be fun.
2843120	2844120	Do you approve Dark Sakura?
2844120	2845120	Oh, hell yeah.
2845120	2846120	All right.
2846120	2848160	Well, there's other things that I approve of.
2848160	2849160	What's that?
2849160	2852560	That's actually the UK Virtual Consoles stuff that's coming out.
2852560	2855320	That's awfully nice of you to approve of that when you can't download them here.
2855320	2856320	So?
2856320	2857320	We will eventually.
2857320	2858320	Yeah, I guess that's true.
2858320	2863200	I mean, we pretty much mirrored, you know, eventually what comes out there in here.
2863200	2864200	True.
2864200	2865200	And vice versa.
2865200	2871640	So what's coming out is Kirby 64, the Crystal Shards, which, like the title suggests, is
2871640	2872880	a Nintendo 64 game.
2872880	2880520	It's a thousand Wii points, or seven pounds, and it's a lot of Kirby 3D joy and running
2880520	2885160	around and, you know, sucking, I guess.
2885160	2897040	So also coming out is Psychosis, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, 600 Wii points.
2897040	2904480	And basically, now this game had a really cool premise, I thought, that you were entering
2904480	2911440	your own mind as a spaceship to get rid of something that's invaded your mind.
2911440	2912440	So it's sort of like R-Type.
2912440	2913440	Interesting.
2913440	2922960	However, it's got this sort of surrealist pattern to it.
2922960	2924960	It's pretty cool.
2924960	2927000	Huh.
2927000	2929160	Are these games that you would pay money to re-download?
2929160	2931800	Well, Psychosis maybe.
2931800	2934160	Oh, and there's another one there that I'd probably get.
2934160	2935160	What's that?
2935160	2939360	Super Turrican, which was an SNES game.
2939360	2947840	It's 800 points for a virtual console, and it's basically just run-and-shoot stuff.
2947840	2948840	It's a side-scroller.
2948840	2950760	Wasn't that this week's release here, Loki?
2950760	2952000	I can't remember.
2952000	2955600	Actually, the lists I've got are just ones coming out this month.
2955600	2957380	That's all right.
2957380	2961200	This month, at least from Sega, we're going to get two titles from them.
2961200	2966120	One is Puyo Puyo 2, so that should be pretty cool.
2966120	2973560	And the other one is Powerball, which does not have anything to do with the lotto, unfortunately.
2973560	2977920	It's like a hybrid of rugby and football.
2977920	2979960	So interesting.
2979960	2981280	That's kind of neat, I guess.
2981280	2986600	Both those, I believe, were Genesis titles, so if I remember correctly, I think it's like
2986600	2987600	800 points.
2987600	2989600	Puyo Puyo 2.
2989600	2991480	Ravenstaufen makes a good point.
2991480	2995440	Super Turrican was one of the Super Nintendo games that actually supported Dolby Surround
2995440	2997720	. There were a handful of games that did that.
2997720	2998720	That's cool.
2998720	3001960	I want to ask you, Dark Soccer, because I know you gave a big woohoo when we heard about
3001960	3002960	Puyo Puyo 2.
3002960	3008200	I know the original Puyo Puyo was kind of what we know over here as Dr. Robotnik's
3008200	3012280	Mean Bean Machine, the Kirby game, Kirby Avalanche, right?
3012280	3013280	Kirby's Avalanche.
3013280	3016200	What makes Puyo Puyo 2 so woohoo-worthy?
3016200	3018840	It's Puyo Puyo.
3018840	3024280	For puzzle games, the Puyo Puyo series is my favorite of all time.
3024280	3029160	I could sit and play this for hours, and I can get through this more than I can get through
3029160	3030160	Tetris.
3030160	3031160	I'll put it that way.
3031160	3037000	And I was really, really addicted and good at Tetris, but Puyo Puyo is like...
3037000	3043040	It's just the whole, you know, not only do you have to just, you know, make lines and
3043040	3051640	get rid of stuff, but you have to use strategy to, you know, cripple your opponent, too.
3051640	3056040	I mean, it's the same concept you get in Puzzle Fighter, which is why I also like Puzzle Fighter
3056040	3057440	a whole lot.
3057440	3065960	But my very first Puyo Puyo that I played was Kirby's Avalanche, and it was just...
3065960	3069240	I still have my copy, my original copy, that I bought when it was new.
3069240	3072280	I think I do, in my big gaming archive somewhere.
3072280	3077880	But I mean, as far as puzzlers go, I think that was one of the big ones to really, you
3077880	3081800	know, make that competitive, fun edge in a puzzle game.
3081800	3085920	DJ Dark Knight in chat says, I wish the newer Puyo Puyo for the DS was stateside.
3085920	3088240	I thought we did have a DS Puyo Puyo.
3088240	3090400	Or is there, like, a newer version that came out in Japan?
3090400	3091400	I guess there must be.
3091400	3094240	Well, we got Puyo Pop, I think.
3094240	3096760	Yeah, which is okay.
3096760	3102800	I still actually need to go back and get Puyo Puyo Sun on Saturn, because that one's supposed
3102800	3104120	to be really, really good.
3104120	3107680	Oh, DJ Dark Knight says the newer one is on Wi-Fi.
3107680	3109000	That's pretty rad.
3109000	3110000	That's really cool.
3110000	3111000	That is very cool.
3111000	3114080	Well, since we talked about virtual console releases, let's talk about some things that
3114080	3117720	are going to be sold in a more traditional format this week and travel around the world
3117720	3119080	and talk about the release dates.
3119080	3120760	I'll start off with Japan tonight.
3120760	3126200	Xbox 360 in Japan is getting Skate on March 13th from Electronic Arts.
3126200	3130400	Moving on to other systems in Japan, PlayStation 3 also getting Skate, but they're also getting
3130400	3134040	Winning Post 7 Maximum 2008.
3134040	3136080	I'm not actually sure what kind of sport that is.
3136080	3137080	Winning Post?
3137080	3138080	It's horse racing.
3138080	3140440	Yeah, I was going to say.
3140440	3146720	It's still not Derby Owners Club or Final Furlong, which will always be one of my favorite
3146720	3147720	arcade games.
3147720	3148720	Final Furlong is Hump A Horse.
3148720	3153960	I thought they had some horse racing games on the Wii in Japan.
3153960	3155120	I wish those were coming over here.
3155120	3156120	That'd be funny.
3156120	3159400	Well, I'm assuming that there must be six other games in this particular series, seeing
3159400	3161120	as they have a seven in it.
3161120	3167360	All right, well anyway, on the Nintendo Wii, also Winning Post 7 Maximum 2008, which must
3167360	3171960	be kind of fun on the Wii, I imagine, if the Wii controls are what I imagine they are,
3171960	3174320	where you actually would get to whip your horse with the remote.
3174320	3175320	Mush!
3175320	3178260	I remember when you had Politary.
3178260	3179260	The horse?
3179260	3180260	Yeah.
3180260	3181260	Oh, Derby Owners Club.
3181260	3182260	Good times.
3182260	3183260	I miss that game.
3183260	3184260	Speaking of which, I didn't even mention this during the gaming week.
3184260	3185680	I'm going to take a tangent real fast.
3185680	3186680	I don't care.
3186680	3189480	You know how we were going to go play DDR on, I think it was Wednesday night, right?
3189480	3190480	Yeah.
3190480	3191480	We were going to play DDR.
3191480	3195320	Well, and then you had to cancel because you had other things going on, but William and
3195320	3197760	I went down there anyway, just to check it out.
3197760	3200400	It's frickin' Arcade Mania on Wednesday nights.
3200400	3202360	Let's go on Thursdays and stuff.
3202360	3203360	Bleh.
3203360	3204360	And I think they...
3204360	3205880	I don't remember seeing the Derby Machine.
3205880	3207520	I don't know if they got rid of it.
3207520	3208520	No!
3208520	3209520	I think it might still be there.
3209520	3210520	I don't want to cause a panic yet.
3210520	3212520	They put it in the bathroom or something.
3212520	3213520	Probably.
3213520	3214520	Anyway, sorry.
3214520	3218440	What would this show be without my random tangents?
3218440	3219440	Come on.
3219440	3223280	Transformers the Game also coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan.
3223280	3227480	If you haven't heard yet, you shouldn't buy this game, because it sucks.
3227480	3231000	Well, here's something that they're saying does not suck, and it's actually all kinds
3231000	3232000	of cool.
3232000	3236760	Baroque on the Wii makes its way in Japan this week, and that is our role-playing game
3236760	3238440	that's going to be pretty hot.
3238440	3240280	A few more weeks, we're going to get that too.
3240280	3243680	Yeah, it is coming out here, but if you want to get an early sneak peek and you can understand
3243680	3245600	Japanese, you might want to import that.
3245600	3247600	Or if you live in Japan, check it out.
3247600	3251600	PlayStation 2, guess what, winning post 7, also on PlayStation 2.
3251600	3257040	Also this week on March 13th, where would we be without a Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle
3257040	3258040	Orchestra?
3258040	3259040	Woohoo!
3259040	3260640	Oh, it's actually just a price reduction.
3260640	3261640	It's not a new release.
3261640	3262640	My bad.
3262640	3266760	They should do like a new Owen Dunn-type game with Evangelion.
3266760	3267760	What's that?
3267760	3269240	I have one of the Evangelion games.
3269240	3271440	See, I'm so glad I'm not the only one that does tangents.
3271440	3272800	Yes, Jamie, you have one of the games.
3272800	3273800	What is it?
3273800	3278400	It's on Saturn, not the Steel Girlfriend, but the other one that came out.
3278400	3281440	And all it is, is really confusing.
3281440	3283320	It's like a dating sim.
3283320	3288160	If this one's like the others, it's like a dating sim where you play as, I guess you
3288160	3292960	play as Shinji and then you choose different things in battle, then really it's just, oh
3292960	3293960	look, it's shooting.
3293960	3294960	Bang.
3294960	3295960	Oh look, the creature falls.
3295960	3296960	Bang.
3296960	3301080	How could you think about dating now when the world is ending?
3301080	3304080	I don't know, we've seen End of Evangelion.
3304080	3308720	Alright, if I may move on with the releases, there is a new release on PlayStation 2, and
3308720	3311440	it even comes with a limited edition if you want to get it.
3311440	3317320	12 Riven, the psi criminal of Intergal, that's the name of the games coming out in Japan.
3317320	3322440	Let's see, check out the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, Call of Duty 4.
3322440	3326440	I didn't know they had to wait for this game, Contra Dual Spirits finally comes out in Japan
3326440	3328140	this week.
3328140	3335580	Jewel Love, Kosuru Otome wa Shiori no Joshin comes out as well.
3335580	3339320	Lots of titles this week, more stuff in the Simple DS series.
3339320	3340320	Yu-Gi-Oh!
3340320	3348360	Spirit Summoner gets a price reduction, and Koinu no Heya, and Kantan Tanoshi Okuyashi
3348360	3351720	Navi DS comes out from Koi.
3351720	3356800	And oh, this is kind of rad, The Legend of Kage 2, Kage Densetsu comes out.
3356800	3360320	I forgot that they were, I remember now hearing a story about that they were making a sequel
3360320	3361320	to The Legend of Kage.
3361320	3363200	That's kind of rad.
3363200	3366920	So that will be coming out on the Nintendo DS, and lastly, let me see if there's anything
3366920	3374720	of note on the PSP, oh, Dark Sakura, Parodius Portable gets a price reduction this week.
3374720	3375720	Woo-hoo!
3375720	3376720	You want to check that out?
3376720	3377720	Time to import.
3377720	3379640	Same thing with the Salamander Portable, and Twinbee Portable.
3379640	3380640	Woo-hoo!
3380640	3381640	Jamie, you need to go on a shopping spree.
3381640	3382640	Really time to import.
3382640	3383900	You need to go on a shopping spree.
3383900	3385720	No new games, but easy.
3385720	3389320	I love Twinbee and Parodius and Salamander.
3389320	3394200	Some accessories come out like Easy Pouch Portable and Inner Pouch Portable.
3394200	3401320	If you ever wanted to camouflage Inner Pouch, here's your chance.
3401320	3402320	Let's move on.
3402320	3403320	Please.
3403320	3411040	We've got our UK releases on the 13th is Sam and Max episode 204, Chariots of the Dogs
3411040	3412380	on PC.
3412380	3417000	And the 14th, Rob's favorite, Build-a-Bear Workshop on the DS.
3417000	3418000	Oh, hooray.
3418000	3419000	The 14th is...
3419000	3421600	That is coming for Wii sometime soon, too.
3421600	3422600	Yay!
3422600	3433360	The 14th is CSI Hard Evidence, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker on DS, Fish Tycoon, Flat Out
3433360	3444480	Head On, Jumper on Wii, Master of Illusion on DS, No More Heroes on Wii, Star Trek Conquest,
3444480	3449740	which will be PS2 and Wii, The Spiderwick Chronicles on DS, and Turning Point Fall of
3449740	3453240	Liberty on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
3453240	3455400	There's another Star Trek game coming out?
3455400	3458320	Please tell me it doesn't suck, like the last one that came out on 360.
3458320	3459320	I still wouldn't.
3459320	3460320	On 360?
3460320	3461320	Yeah.
3461320	3462320	There was a...
3462320	3463320	What was it, Armada or whatever it was called?
3463320	3464320	There was a game that came out.
3464320	3467040	It was on the Wii and...
3467040	3468280	I think it was on the Wii.
3468280	3469280	The Wii and PS2.
3469280	3470280	Oh, that's right.
3470280	3471280	That's right.
3471280	3472280	It came out around November for us.
3472280	3474000	I'm waiting for the Star Trek anime, though.
3474000	3476120	That's going to be fun.
3476120	3477120	I hope it happens.
3477120	3478120	I know it keeps changing.
3478120	3479120	Anyway, sorry.
3479120	3480120	Okay.
3480120	3485800	In the US, we're getting some good stuff this week.
3485800	3490760	Of course today, Smash Brothers, if you haven't picked it up yet, or just, I don't know, maybe
3490760	3497080	you haven't heard over the last six months that it's coming out today, it has.
3497080	3501080	Later this week, though, we've got some cool stuff, including Condemned 2, Bloodshot, that's
3501080	3505480	coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3505480	3509400	If you're in the mood for a light gun game for the Wii, we've got House of the Dead 2
3509400	3513680	and 3 Returns for a whopping $29.99.
3513680	3515000	Not bad.
3515000	3519560	And let's see, also Insecticide is going to be on the DS.
3519560	3523520	That was supposed to be one of those adventure games, almost kind of like a LucasArts type
3523520	3526480	thing from Gamecock.
3526480	3535760	And Pro Evo 2008, that's on almost every system out there, Konami's a soccer game.
3535760	3542480	Buzz Junior RoboJam, if you have preschoolers, they might like that.
3542480	3549760	Nano Straight 2 on the DS, that's a good shooter game, if you like some of those Japanese-style
3549760	3550760	ones.
3550760	3557640	Wild Arms XF, a really cool game from XSeed, that's on PSP.
3557640	3566400	There's also a collection of previously released wrestling games, WWE Smackdown vs Raw Super
3566400	3574920	Star series, and I believe the last three games are released in that.
3574920	3580760	Buzz The Hollywood Quiz, that's on PlayStation 2 as well this week.
3580760	3586900	Also Ratchet and Clank Size Matters on PlayStation 2, and let's see, World Championship Cards
3586900	3588400	on PSP.
3588400	3592760	That's, I don't know, looks kind of boring.
3592760	3601600	You can't wait for the wireless nunchuck adapter, they've got the cord-free wireless adapter
3601600	3607160	for your existing nunchucks, so until the actual wireless nunchuck comes out, that'll
3607160	3608780	I guess have to do.
3608780	3617900	And then, unfortunately, I have to mention this, but I believe, no actually that may
3617900	3622880	be Monday, whatever, but coming out next week, or the week after next I should say, I had
3622880	3626160	judgment, BioLith Rebellion 2 booster pack.
3626160	3627560	There's cards for that.
3627560	3633500	We need a million copies to sell, folks!
3633500	3638480	And no, we will not be including the booster packs, I'm afraid.
3638480	3640680	Aww, jerk.
3640680	3642680	Never mind, don't buy it.
3642680	3645720	Alright, but didn't we get to include the sales of some other game?
3645720	3648640	Was it Let's Be Friends Forever?
3648640	3649800	I don't remember.
3649800	3651720	Was it Let's Ride Friends Forever?
3651720	3652720	Maybe, I don't remember.
3652720	3656160	I think it may have been Let's Ride Friends Forever, I don't know.
3656160	3657840	Just gotta keep track of all these games.
3657840	3660080	Alright, that are part of the bet.
3660080	3664220	Well, one game definitely wasn't a part of the bet because it probably would have sold
3664220	3668540	tons of copies and Loki would be running around in a tingle suit before we know it, is Bully.
3668540	3673160	But some people who bought the new version of Bully on the 360 this week apparently were
3673160	3675160	left pretty disappointed.
3675160	3677960	Basically the game came out and it was buggy.
3677960	3682520	There's audio glitches, frame rate problems, crashes.
3682520	3688600	This game definitely did not really do very well in QA or something, or I don't know if
3688600	3689600	they were asleep or what.
3689600	3692320	Or they just said, release it, we'll fix it in a week.
3692320	3693320	Well, who knows?
3693320	3694320	I mean, I don't know.
3694320	3695480	I don't know who's to blame for this.
3695480	3698200	Maybe they were doing it on dev kits or something and something changed.
3698200	3699200	I don't know.
3699200	3704120	But regardless, a Rockstar Games has basically come out and made a public apology.
3704120	3705440	Really just a giant, my bad.
3705440	3708680	But they are going to be doing a title update via Xbox Live.
3708680	3713320	They are going to release a patch sometime in the next week.
3713320	3717720	No word yet if Rockstar is actually going to be offering a complete replacement program
3717720	3720600	kind of like had to happen for Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii.
3720600	3722120	Probably not, because they're fixing it.
3722120	3724240	They can patch it on 360.
3724240	3728000	The Wii doesn't really have anything built in the place where they can patch that stuff,
3728000	3732960	so that's why they did the full replacements.
3732960	3734520	Did you pick up Bully by chance?
3734520	3736600	Do you own any version of Bully?
3736600	3738200	No, I don't own Bully.
3738200	3740040	I think I may try it on the Wii.
3740040	3743120	I don't know, we'll see.
3743120	3746080	Does the Wii have all the waggle controls and all that good stuff?
3746080	3747080	It does.
3747080	3748080	And I don't know.
3748080	3752680	I'm not, I don't really have time to play it right now, that's the problem.
3752680	3754960	Maybe later I'll pick it up when it drops in price some more.
3754960	3757080	Boy, our chat room is full of comedians tonight.
3757080	3761240	Rob with 2B says maybe Bully was a typo for Buggy.
3761240	3769480	And Tigerclaw says the 360 has been bullied from the sounds of it.
3769480	3771720	No two drink minimum here, folks.
3771720	3773040	All for free in chat.
3773040	3775920	Well, how about a little bit of better news?
3775920	3781460	This is for people who, like me, have an iPhone.
3781460	3784640	There are games coming out on the iPhone, finally.
3784640	3793760	And among them is an adaptation of Spore for iPhone, and Super Monkey Ball, with updated
3793760	3797880	graphics and everything, going to be on the iPhone.
3797880	3802720	There's also the actual first game is going to be called Touch Fighter, which you use
3802720	3806800	as a, I guess like a steering wheel.
3806800	3809640	The note on here says it took two weeks to develop, so it probably isn't going to be
3809640	3812360	all that great.
3812360	3822680	And then there's also some talk about worms, possibly a port of worms and a few other things.
3822680	3829000	And Apple's going to be making 30% of every sale, so that's going to be good news for
3829000	3830800	them.
3830800	3834440	I'm going to have some Monkey Ball.
3834440	3835840	That sounds so wrong.
3835840	3843960	Gold Banjo calls it Eye Spore, and oh man, we unleashed a beast, because me reading jokes
3843960	3847760	in chat, just now everything's going downhill now.
3847760	3851120	Son of Dad says, Eye Spore would be an eye sore.
3851120	3858200	Oh my God, he did not say that, did he?
3858200	3859200	Yes.
3859200	3860200	Startezia, no.
3860200	3861200	What?
3861200	3864360	I can't talk to you, you don't have an iPhone.
3864360	3867440	One of Extrofer's quotes, I was in one of his YouTubes.
3867440	3871400	It's funny stuff, anyway, tangent, hello.
3871400	3874400	That's us, the tangent cast.
3874400	3881400	So Bungie, after hearing the story last week about a kid who sent in his Xbox 360, that
3881400	3889600	had been signed by various members of the Bungie team and also from Rooster Teeth, the
3889600	3897160	folks who do Red vs. Blue, having it come back completely wiped clean, Bungie has actually
3897160	3903640	rallied together to kind of, I don't know, make up for Microsoft's mistake.
3903640	3906040	And they've, I think, gone a little bit above and beyond.
3906040	3915360	They sent him a full, I don't know, swag box, basically, with a signed Halo 3 helmet signed
3915360	3924920	by the entire team of Bungie and just a whole bunch of other swag from Halo 3, including
3924920	3931360	the limited edition controllers, the Tom McFarland figurines, faceplates, wall graphics, just
3931360	3932480	everything.
3932480	3935360	So good job, Bungie.
3935360	3937840	I thought that was really cool of them, too.
3937840	3942860	They didn't have to, it wasn't their fault, but they made good on it.
3942860	3947020	Achievement unlocked, as successfully kissed.
3947020	3949480	I don't have the little noise, sorry.
3949480	3951200	You need to get on that.
3951200	3952720	I know, I will work on that.
3952720	3957800	Maybe for part B I will get the achievement unlock noise for you guys.
3957800	3962840	One thing that is probably inevitable that's going to happen at some point is that Microsoft's
3962840	3967080	going to want to upgrade those hard drives that are custom to come with the 3, I'm sorry,
3967080	3968400	is the show boring you, Dark Soccer?
3968400	3969400	No.
3969400	3970400	Just let out a big old yawn.
3970400	3971880	I don't know if the mic picked that up.
3971880	3972880	I don't know.
3972880	3973880	I needed oxygen.
3973880	3974880	All right.
3974880	3976880	No, that's all right.
3976880	3981240	Anyhow, apparently Microsoft is going to be getting rid of the 20 gigabyte hard drive
3981240	3984760	that it currently comes with the core system, but no worries, it's actually something better
3984760	3985760	that's going to happen.
3985760	3987800	They're going to get a 60 gigabyte system.
3987800	3992360	So the core system is going away, and instead you're going to get a pro system.
3992360	3997960	So that's coming from a site named Trusted Reviews, and they seem pretty sure about this
3997960	4000200	new world exclusive they've got.
4000200	4006720	And usually we don't trust no-name sites, but then again, what are we, right?
4006720	4007840	Here's my thought on it.
4007840	4009080	It makes sense.
4009080	4010600	I guess it makes sense.
4010600	4015120	I don't think they're going to get rid of the core system, because they still have that
4015120	4016120	argument.
4016120	4017120	I'm sorry.
4017120	4018120	I meant premium, not core.
4018120	4019120	What the hell was I thinking?
4019120	4020120	Thank you, chat.
4020120	4024400	The premium system, what they may do, because the cost of storage is obviously coming down,
4024400	4030560	is they may just start replacing the 20s with 60s, so eventually they won't be selling the
4030560	4031840	20 gig hard drive anymore.
4031840	4036840	It'll just come with a 60 gig hard drive, probably for the same price.
4036840	4039520	Or hey, maybe they'll include a price drop in that at the same time.
4039520	4041200	Wouldn't that be awesome?
4041200	4044840	But I doubt it.
4044840	4048600	This would make a lot of sense, though, that this is just a matter of time before this
4048600	4051320	comes out, so we shall see.
4051320	4060160	Well, as far as other things to see, and this makes me happy, there is going to be, finally,
4060160	4067840	a Doctor Who game coming out for the DS, PS2, and PC, and that makes me very, very, very
4067840	4069200	happy.
4069200	4073400	And I'm assuming that you'd probably play as the 10th Doctor.
4073400	4076760	I mean, I would just assume, although it'd be kind of cool if you get your choice, you
4076760	4083600	know, or if you, like, play as a Dalek and exterminate everything in your path, I think
4083600	4084600	that that would be awesome.
4084600	4089640	And you know, there were Doctor Who games, like, you know, back in, you know, the early
4089640	4093680	80s, I think, but this just makes me happy.
4093680	4099120	It would be kind of cool, though, if you could play as a Cyberman and upgrade everybody.
4099120	4101280	Any details about, like, what exactly the game's going to tell?
4101280	4105580	Because I seem to remember we had this announcement on the show before, but it was, like, a rumor,
4105580	4108600	so I'm just kind of curious, like, did we get any bonus information, or is this just
4108600	4112160	people wanting us to remember that it is coming soon?
4112160	4117720	Eidos is bringing it out, and the quote is not too far away as far as the release date,
4117720	4121400	so it gets the soon category.
4121400	4122880	So it will be coming soon.
4122880	4125400	I would say probably later than soon.
4125400	4129620	Well, congratulations, DarkSakura, you have successfully worked a Doctor Who reference
4129620	4130620	into our program.
4130620	4131620	Woohoo!
4131620	4132620	There you go.
4132620	4136200	I told you I'd find the noise at some point.
4136200	4137200	Good job.
4137200	4138200	Good job.
4138200	4139200	Now, Loki, if you...
4139200	4140760	He's keeping track of our achievement points, chat room.
4140760	4152620	Now, Loki, if you can successfully read the next story with no boo-boos, 30 gamerscore.
4152620	4158120	So Sega made an announcement basically this week saying that they're not interested in
4158120	4161720	a buyout from EA.
4161720	4167720	So basically they had an interview with Rooters, and the Sega Sammy CEO Simon Jeffries said
4167720	4172800	his company is eager to ride the industry's recent wave of consolidation.
4172800	4174640	That's not an area we want to play in right now.
4174640	4178560	He said we have no interest in being acquired, we are very happy with our position right
4178560	4182140	now.
4182140	4184160	My thought on this is, who asked you?
4184160	4187160	I mean, no one's trying to buy Sega right now, so...
4187160	4189560	Well, Loki, tell us what you really think.
4189560	4191800	Well, we don't want to be bought out right now.
4191800	4195100	That's okay, we don't want to buy you right now either, so...
4195100	4197320	That's exactly what Ross Steel, UT, and chat says.
4197320	4202160	Who the hell wants to buy Sega Sammy?
4202160	4203560	That's kind of sad.
4203560	4207920	I know, I know, but you know, it's just kind of like, well, we don't want to be bought
4207920	4209920	out, see?
4209920	4213440	It's not like they're not getting offered to be bought out, it's just like, well, even
4213440	4215760	if we were offered we'd say no, so...
4215760	4220000	And Ranma and chat says, leave Sega alone!
4220000	4225760	They don't have to make games for you!
4225760	4236200	I mean, if they did buy Sega, you would get the rights to the official Beijing 2008 Olympics
4236200	4237200	game.
4237200	4238200	Ooh, maybe.
4238200	4241640	Didn't Sega make the Mario Sonic game, or did somebody else make that?
4241640	4242880	Sega made the Mario Sonic game.
4242880	4244720	And you know, the Mario Sonic game did pretty well.
4244720	4245960	It sold 5 million worldwide.
4245960	4246960	That's right.
4246960	4247960	Man, a lot of people are suckers.
4247960	4251960	I think that was one of the stories that was lost in our Part B destroyage last week, but
4251960	4252960	you know.
4252960	4258720	Well, you know, EA and Sega could team up, you know, possibly on The Sims 3, because
4258720	4264320	The Sims 3, you know, has been actually announced that it is coming, and here's the thing about
4264320	4270240	The Sims 3, here's the big twist, in The Sims 3 you will be going outside.
4270240	4276280	Now not in real life, unfortunately, but The Sims 3 will focus a little more on outdoor
4276280	4277280	life.
4277280	4282000	It's supposed to have a more large, and like, just a gigantic neighborhood, where if you
4282000	4286360	actually leave your house, you get into a much bigger area that you can kind of play
4286360	4287360	with.
4287360	4288920	And kill Sims.
4288920	4289920	Hopefully.
4289920	4294980	So, Sims mood, Sims motives, that whole thing is changing.
4294980	4297720	Players are going to be encouraged to just, you know, be more social.
4297720	4301600	It's going to be more of a social game, as opposed to you getting your points for, you
4301600	4306240	know, remembering to eat and sleep and poop and all that stuff, so.
4306240	4311640	Speaking of which, there will be no more P meter in The Sims.
4311640	4314560	They are getting rid of that in The Sims 3.
4314560	4318900	Here's a quote from the latest issue of Games for Windows magazine, quote, the biggest change
4318900	4322620	to The Sims 3 is that it takes place in a wide open, constantly changing neighborhood,
4322620	4326520	a much bigger sandbox, if you will, and a much more complex situation.
4326520	4330640	The town and park you see on the cover image to the right exists in the same seamless space
4330640	4334640	as your Sims household, and what you do outside your home now matters as much as what you
4334640	4337640	do within.
4337640	4338640	And somewhere in the-
4338640	4339640	So you can't let yourself in front of people?
4339640	4340640	Unfortunately, no.
4340640	4347800	Dude, the best thing was to send somebody on a date and ignore their P meter?
4347800	4353840	I think the best thing was my old roommate, Billy, did the best house ever, it was hilarious.
4353840	4358120	He had seven gay guys all in a house, and you know, he had them all making out with
4358120	4360880	each other or whatever, and then there was one woman that lived there.
4360880	4365000	Well somewhere along the line, he forgot to build a bathroom, so the poor woman just had
4365000	4372040	to clean up all the guys' messes, and eventually she died of fatigue, it was really sad.
4372040	4376000	But she could never go to bed, because she always had to-
4376000	4382560	Julie made the death house, which had like a swimming pool with no ladder, and had flammable
4382560	4386000	objects, and she wouldn't teach them how to cook, but she'd make them cook.
4386000	4390280	The thing is, they won't jump into the pool unless you put a ladder in.
4390280	4391280	Well that's right, but you take it out.
4391280	4393680	Yeah, you take it out once they're in the pool, and then they don't know how to get
4393680	4395320	out of the pool without a ladder.
4395320	4397000	I love it.
4397000	4401880	It's like, you know, ordinary people can climb out of a pool without a ladder, but oh, the
4401880	4404480	Sims just can't do it.
4404480	4408480	And then you'd make like cells, you know, where you put them in the room and then you
4408480	4411080	remove the door, so they're just trapped in the room.
4411080	4415600	You trap them in the wall and you put a table with a radio on it, full blast, next to them.
4415600	4417880	And she had like a full graveyard in the backyard.
4417880	4420480	You know, I'm thinking we have issues.
4420480	4422800	Like seriously, issues.
4422800	4427200	I like snatching people off the street in debug mode and throwing them into my house
4427200	4433680	and they're never to be seen ever again.
4433680	4434680	This is so wrong!
4434680	4435680	Alright.
4435680	4436680	That's beautiful.
4436680	4439080	I like your psychosis there.
4439080	4444120	Dark Sakura, we really need you to bring some sanity back to the show.
4444120	4446040	Dude, I was bringing the insanity.
4446040	4450120	And well, I guess it's only going to continue because this is the part of the show we like
4450120	4456120	to call Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.
4456120	4457120	I have a game.
4457120	4460840	Please say you've picked something relatively sane for the listeners tonight.
4460840	4462160	Hell no!
4462160	4465760	I've picked something intensely insane.
4465760	4470200	I have VibRibbon as our game of the week, which is quite insane.
4470200	4473960	Now, this would have nothing to do with the fact that you have kind of like brought up
4473960	4477080	this game and referenced it on previous shows.
4477080	4478800	I just wanted to pick it.
4478800	4479800	Oh, okay.
4479800	4480800	Well, you can do whatever you want.
4480800	4490720	But we need to play the intro for everybody so they know how to play it.
4490720	4499720	The game sings to you to tell you how to play it.
4499720	4504200	The whole tutorial is sung to you by the stupid little rabbit and the game's all vector, which
4504200	4505840	I think is pretty freaking fantastic.
4505840	4512080	Well, not like true vector, but it's like a simple line and a line-drawing bunny that
4512080	4513720	you play as.
4513720	4522080	The game was developed by Matsuura Masaya, who was the guy who brought us Parappa and
4522080	4523080	Umjiramalani.
4523080	4531440	Basically, Vibri, who is the main character, if you do badly, well, let me start off how
4531440	4532440	to play it.
4532440	4533720	First of all, you've got obstacles that are in the way.
4533720	4540360	You have a block or a loop or a wave or a pit.
4540360	4545200	And you have to press a different button to bypass this as you're going along on basically
4545200	4549160	this continuous line.
4549160	4555960	And the way that it goes is, you know, if you don't go over the obstacles by pressing
4555960	4559940	the right button, you will get hurt.
4559940	4564120	And the more you get hurt, you change forms and you can turn from a rabbit into a frog
4564120	4566800	and then a worm and then you just die.
4566800	4570880	However, if you do really well, you eventually turn into a fairy princess.
4570880	4575360	Loki, this sounds like your kind of game.
4575360	4576640	You can be a fairy princess.
4576640	4578680	Oh yeah, totally.
4578680	4580160	Right now.
4580160	4589480	But the other thing about this is that there are six, I believe, no, there's a few songs
4589480	4595200	that are, yeah, six songs that are included in the game itself.
4595200	4599400	However you can put in your own CDs and play whatever you want to, which we've tried to
4599400	4604720	do to like a whole bunch of old Beatmania stuff, but I found the best thing ever.
4604720	4606600	Let me actually play this for you guys.
4606600	4610640	I know this makes horrible radio when you can't actually see the video, but I think
4610640	4613940	you'll see why this is so epic when I load this here, what somebody actually did this
4613940	4615280	YouTube here.
4615280	4623120	The username on YouTube is 725Natsuko and 725Natsuko put in a very familiar song in
4623120	4626400	the VIB ribbon.
4626400	4640400	That's right, it's VIB ribbon to Dragon Force.
4640400	4642400	And Dragon Force, of course, makes any game epic.
4642400	4649400	Well, a little bit more as you go into this game, just a few more details, is that some
4649400	4653320	of your other obstacles are combinations of your basic core obstacles, so you have to
4653320	4656720	press the combination of the two buttons that would have been for the individual obstacle,
4656720	4658480	which is where I was getting hung up.
4658480	4664600	And then you have different levels of gameplay where you'll have your obstacles coming at
4664600	4672760	you, but then as you go through harder levels, they'll cross over each other so you really
4672760	4675960	don't know, you know it's coming up, but you don't know that that's the next one.
4675960	4681040	It's like the obstacles are coming towards you at different speeds, and you can also
4681040	4685280	play it straight forward, as in you're just staring at it across the screen, but as you
4685280	4692480	play harder levels, you're playing at it from different angles, so it gets quite a bit harder.
4692480	4698640	And like I said, the guy that brought this out gave us Krappa and Umjumma Lamy, but there's
4698640	4699640	also sequels.
4699640	4705280	There's Moja Ribbon, which I think I'm actually still going to pick up, but Moja Ribbon, you
4705280	4711520	basically are, it's almost like you're rapping, but you're playing kanji.
4711520	4714120	I played it once, it is fascinating.
4714120	4715760	It's so different than Vib Ribbon.
4715760	4717120	There's a third Vib Ribbon series.
4717120	4721240	There's Vib Ripple that came out as well.
4721240	4729120	Vib Ripple is supposed to be done with different images that are loaded into the game that
4729120	4730120	you play with.
4730120	4739120	Also, there is talk of making a remake of Vib Ribbon for PS3 that will be out via the
4739120	4745520	PlayStation Network, and the quote is saying we're discussing the possibility of making
4745520	4751320	a downloadable version of Vib Ribbon for Sony, but I don't know yet, so that would be really
4751320	4752320	cool.
4752320	4757120	And actually, this game came out in Japan and came out in Europe, but we never got it
4757120	4758120	in America.
4758120	4762920	And it was so weird to see the intro in English when I looked at this YouTube, I was like,
4762920	4765400	oh yes, right, they got this game in Europe, because I've only ever played the Japanese
4765400	4766400	one that you had.
4766400	4769560	That's why I linked it to you so that you could see, because it has this, and it's not
4769560	4772720	an exact translation, but I love Vibri.
4772720	4776560	I love Vibri, okay, Vibri is great.
4776560	4777560	Excellent stuff.
4777560	4783440	Oh, and also when you get the high score in this game, he sings a little song to you.
4783440	4786440	There should be a link up there of the song he sings when you get a high score, but it's
4786440	4792920	just this little dance that says, yay, you got a high score, let me serenade you.
4792920	4793920	This game is great.
4793920	4795720	Look, he's a fairy princess now.
4795720	4800400	A lovely dose of insanity courtesy of Dark Sakura from the ever-so-cracked-out, you've
4800400	4804480	got to check the searches on YouTube, look at the videos, it's awesome, Vib Ribbon, that's
4804480	4809120	V-I-B Ribbon is the name of the game, check that out.
4809120	4812040	It's this week's Classic Game of the Week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4812040	4814000	Good pick, Dark Sakura.
4814000	4816280	Predictable, but good.
4816280	4817280	I approve.
4817280	4818280	It was a matter of time.
4818280	4819800	I knew it was just a matter of time.
4819800	4823080	All right, well, that's going to do it here for Orange Lounge Radio Part A, but we will
4823080	4827640	be back in a little while with more of Orange Lounge Radio on Part B of our podcast.
4827640	4830320	Yes, we are hoping we will have a Part B this week.
4830320	4833680	Everything is arranged so that should happen, so stay tuned.
4833680	4838160	Part B will be coming at you in just a few days, so we'll see you then.
4838160	4842680	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
4842680	4843680	a week.
4843680	4847920	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
