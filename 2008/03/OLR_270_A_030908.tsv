13979	17123	Tonight, March 9th, 2008, is Smash Bros.
17163	18605	malfunctioning on some Wii's?
19045	22549	More car and track information is released for Gran Turismo 5.
23110	26034	Spore gets a port to an unlikely gaming platform.
31448	36170	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36210	43493	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and, wait for it, the gamer lifestyle.
43913	44913	My name is Rob Roberts.
44953	48754	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49075	49295	Hi.
49835	50575	And how are you, Ms.
50595	50895	Summers?
51275	51596	Meaty.
52056	52416	Meaty?
52976	53936	Mmm, so meaty.
55137	56417	What exactly are you eating tonight?
56817	60779	I'm eating a protein-style cheeseburger from In-N-Out.
61192	61792	Mmm, yum.
62713	64074	This isn't my mic.
64094	65015	Yeah, I think you have Loki's.
66055	66496	That's alright.
67116	67336	Hey.
68137	70598	You know, the technical difficulties just couldn't end with last week.
70618	70979	I feel better.
71179	71839	Alright, there you go.
72139	72960	You feel complete now?
73160	73440	I do.
73921	77323	Yeah, well let me introduce Tech Master Loki real quick and then we'll talk about last week.
77583	80205	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, now with proper mic.
80505	81566	Yes, I have the proper mic.
81766	82386	How are you, Loki?
82987	83267	Good.
83547	87730	I'm just untangling the mic on the mixing board so I don't pull it and it turns all the knobs on there.
88038	88939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
112233	113834	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
128322	129743	Jamie, Rebuttal Jamie, Rebuttal
157396	161099	Loki gets smacked with a large trout or whatever the old MIRC thing is.
161619	170565	Anyhow, so yeah, we will release the kind of cruddy audio part B like on our Facebook and MySpace and all that stuff.
170585	173787	I'll try to get that up tomorrow just for those folks that really want to hear it.
174567	178270	But you know, for the rest of you guys, it's just another broken show.
178290	178770	What can we say?
178810	181612	But we're hoping tonight is working.
182132	183453	We're back to our normal selves.
183513	184293	It's a new month.
185034	186515	The weather's getting warmer again.
187510	190452	We're off to a good start because the network is actually working the way it's supposed to.
190472	193013	We didn't have to jerry-rig a whole second network setup.
193574	198297	So we're hoping we are ready to talk games for our full Part A and Part B tonight.
198337	201999	So I will shut up and turn it over to DarkSakura who will talk about her gaming week.
203760	212205	My gaming week was almost non-existent except for, of course, Ragnarok because I've been very busy trying to get a few things ready and had a few...
214173	217835	Hang-ups come in the way, but I think I'm going to actually be able to play more stuff next week.
219896	220197	That's good.
220257	221837	Sometimes real life gets in the way of gaming.
221858	222358	That's okay.
222698	224299	Sometimes people can't hold the controller.
226000	226380	Gotcha.
227241	227541	All right.
228281	229262	Well, then, Loki, we'll go to you.
229302	229962	How was your gaming week?
231403	231903	It was okay.
232304	238987	I played Orange Box on the PC because I have had it for a while and I haven't actually tried it.
239888	241509	Looks nice on the PC, but...
243114	246856	It's exactly the same, so, you know.
247396	255081	And then, oh yeah, mainly Portal, because that's actually all I got, so, which is Portal.
256261	260164	And then I've been playing a little bit of Smash Bros.
260244	260584	Brawl.
260644	268028	I'm like 30% way through the Subspace Emissary, so that's pretty fun.
270049	271450	Then, what else?
273012	277034	I think I may have played some Patapon, but that's about it.
277434	281997	Tell me a little bit more about Patapon, because I was reading some stuff about it, and it actually sounds like something I kind of want to play.
282237	283818	It sounds kind of cool.
283958	294724	It's basically, I mean, sort of, it's not really a rhythm music game, but you have to keep rhythm with these drums, and depending on what four-note sequence you play, they will do different things.
294904	300867	Like, if you have an attack sequence, you have march forward, retreat, that kind of stuff.
302455	307156	So you just kind of strategize with that and keep in time at the same time.
308337	320120	The other thing that I did wasn't really playing games, but I got to view a lot of games, and that was we had our Eidos rep come out and talk to us a bit about the stuff that they covered during Destination PlayStation.
321000	328942	And we got to see some really cool stuff, including an unreleased trailer for Tomb Raider Legends, or not Tomb Raider Legends, Tomb Raider Underworld,
330106	332708	with gameplay footage on it, and it looks awesome.
333108	333848	Absolutely awesome.
333888	337451	They did some new motion capturing for everything.
338152	338552	Really?
340433	344697	Pardon my skepticism, but I have failed to get excited about Tomb Raider in about 10 years.
344837	346939	It's about as awesome as Uncharted, maybe.
347119	347459	I don't know.
347539	352243	I'm not that excited about Uncharted, but it really does look good.
352603	357847	I can't get excited about Tomb Raider because it's just not my thing, but it looks good.
358911	359251	I don't know.
359612	360532	I wouldn't buy it though.
360832	363434	But it looks good for people who like Tomb Raider.
363614	363954	Not me.
364234	365015	I don't like Tomb Raider.
365455	367977	I like throwing her off a cliff and killing her and that's about it.
369218	371899	But I'm sure you can do that and it will look much nicer.
372120	373821	So, you know, that's it.
375642	376723	Other cool stuff I saw.
376803	377443	There's a game.
377463	379664	I hope I get the title right.
380665	382126	I think it's called Little Ninjas.
383107	384207	And it looks really cool.
384227	388130	It's kind of a cross between almost like Okami and
389537	390398	I don't really know what else.
390458	392659	Maybe Pirates vs. Ninjas or something like that.
393400	395582	Volleyball or dodgeball or whatever.
396002	399585	Very cute little ninjas and they're fighting bad guys and stuff like that.
399765	401826	All kind of cel-shaded and it looks really neat.
402827	405109	So that will be coming out next year, unfortunately.
405870	411294	And then I got to see some gameplay of the new Death Junior that they're doing for the Wii.
411454	412555	It actually looks pretty good.
413575	415597	Hopefully it won't suck like the rest of them.
416425	417825	But I'm pretty confident.
417925	421126	And then the one I was kind of excited about for the... Wait, wait, I have a quick question.
421227	422207	I thought Death Jr.
422227	423167	was a Konami license.
423227	424267	Why is Eidos doing it now?
424808	425448	Different publisher.
425688	427528	It's the company-owned... Oh, gotcha.
427568	428109	Okay, sorry.
429309	429769	Yeah, that's right.
429809	431310	Konami just published someone else's game.
431830	431990	Yeah.
432010	432290	Gotcha.
432790	434130	I wonder why they decided not to do this one.
434711	435091	I don't know.
435251	439112	Maybe the last two sucked for them, and they dropped the publisher, and Eidos picked them up.
439132	439452	Who knows?
440272	445574	I also got to see some pretty cool footage of Gauntlet for the DS.
446791	447611	That's going to be cool.
448372	449592	I wish they'd put it on live.
450553	454674	But it's like a cross between the original Gauntlet and Gauntlet Legends.
456695	462097	It's still top-down, like the original Gauntlet, but it's all 3D and stuff, like Legends was.
462497	469239	The cool thing about it, though, four-player Wi-Fi co-op, and there's voice chat involved with that as well.
469920	471280	So at least they're doing that right.
471660	472841	So that'll be a pretty good purchase.
474005	477646	I've got to catch up on some comments from chat room because we have lots of good stuff tonight.
478707	480787	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to join us.
480867	485809	PKJr92 says, Uncharted is way better than Tomb Raider and you can kill him.
487470	489630	DMN says, Gauntlet DS equals sex.
489770	490691	I will make love to it.
491611	495912	GS68 says, Too many gaming publications credit the publisher and not the developer.
495972	497353	And you're right, and I just made the same mistake.
497393	497733	I'm sorry.
499474	499754	It's okay.
501892	509814	Some other cool stuff I was unaware of, like the series and stuff, like Shellshock 2 they showed us, which I guess that's like a survivor horror game set in NOM.
509834	511415	It's like condemned in NOM, I guess.
513635	515976	And then, what other cool stuff?
516836	520137	Then there's this other Looney Tunes game that was a complete ripoff of Elite Beat Agents.
520237	523118	I mean, completely a ripoff of Elite Beat Agents.
523458	524898	Except, I don't know about the music though.
524918	527599	The music is like out of Looney Tunes, so it's all that orchestrated stuff.
528288	540074	So... Not necessarily that, but I think it did look kind of hard, but it's exactly like Elite Beat Agents.
540355	543556	I mean, if you play Elite Beat Agents, this will be easy for you.
545057	546038	So that's pretty much it.
546218	547118	That was my game week.
547278	557404	It was kind of exciting, though, to get to see everything, and I got to talk to her, but she offered us, well, at least me and my co-worker, to go tour Eidos, but...
558254	560396	You know, we'll see if I can drag other people along.
560436	563098	Don't they make you sign all kinds of papers where you can't talk about it here, though?
564179	571104	No, they're just like, she was talking about, for example, showing us storyboards for Tomb Raider and stuff like that.
571144	571805	That's cool.
572305	572666	I don't know.
572906	575628	A lot of this stuff is, all this stuff was pretty much announced.
575688	579751	Obviously, you know, I don't have the trailer for Tomb Raider Underworld or anything like that.
580232	581893	That's the stuff that wasn't shown.
582193	586237	I mean, kind of shown behind closed doors type thing, but I don't know.
586257	587177	It looks pretty good.
587538	587898	I've just
589228	596253	Just Cause 2 looks exciting, but I like the first one, so looking forward to those Grand Theft Auto type of games.
596393	599535	Sounds like there's a lot coming out for you.
599676	601117	Good fourth quarter for them.
601337	608602	That's pretty good, because Eidos, in the past, it's been a rough ride.
608622	609402	It's been a rough ride?
609743	609963	Yeah.
610023	610323	Well, good.
610343	611624	I'm glad to see them getting back on track.
611977	615339	Hey, Jamie, I got a question for you, because I know you're a fan of Elite Beat Agents, right?
615659	615819	Yeah.
615839	619141	What do you think about the whole Looney Tunes franchise completely knocking it off?
619801	620601	I think it's stupid.
621382	622002	You think it's stupid?
622162	622923	Too much of a good thing?
624383	625444	It's a copy of a copy?
626124	630026	Yeah, I think that if they were going to do something, it would be better for them to do something original.
631047	631467	But who knows?
631507	634809	I mean, obviously, it can't be just a straight-up rip-off, right, Loki?
634849	636529	It's got to have some original stuff in it.
636709	641652	Basically, what it does is recreates the different cartoons, like very famous cartoon scenes or whatever.
642290	645271	and so you're playing the music though with, you know, the cartoon.
645772	646492	That's kind of cool.
647833	649474	Okay, that might actually be kind of neat.
649894	658058	I mean, if you got like the whole thing going on there where the cartoon's going on, that's kind of, I mean, because The Leaping Ages is kind of like that in a way, but, you know, it's different.
658078	660239	It just kind of, it controls exactly the same.
660279	666682	Like, if you looked at the interface and how, like, the different spots where you tap and stuff, it looks exactly the same.
667082	667642	And who knows?
667882	669043	I haven't looked at the developer.
669103	670164	Maybe it's the same developer.
670564	670964	You never know.
671485	675572	Well, GS68 in our chat room, chat.orangenlaunchradio.com, sums it up.
675932	678036	Looney Tunes, Owen Don, do not want.
679343	679924	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
702043	702844	Super Smash Bros Brawl
718633	721134	and, uh, goddamn, I'm having a lot of fun with Super Smash.
721154	726117	But now that I can actually understand it, as opposed to the Japanese version, like, you know, what's going on, I'm having a lot of fun.
726297	729479	But what I do think is interesting is that whole, uh, subspace emissary mode.
729779	735282	You know, obviously I don't want to spoil a whole lot of what's going on, but I think what's interesting is that the cutscenes use no dialogue whatsoever.
735722	737703	There's no dialogue whatsoever in the cutscenes.
737783	742886	Everything is more of an emotional reaction, you know, or it's, it's, everything is, there's no words.
743464	744865	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
773228	775649	They need to do a Mario game just like this on the GameCube.
775669	776629	And of course they never did.
777369	778650	Well, I don't know.
778730	780210	Paper Mario on the Wii is kind of rad.
780430	780770	Like that.
780810	781210	But I don't know.
781831	785272	But, you know, just seeing what they did with the single player mode here and really making it a game.
785292	787872	I mean, it's not like the greatest single player game ever.
788293	792214	And you sort of have to really suspend disbelief to make the story work.
792534	796455	Because they really did kind of have to put all these characters in a blender and kind of pull a story out of their butts.
796915	797675	But it works.
798055	802097	It gets... It does the fanboy service.
802277	802957	And that's really...
803410	808137	you know what this game is all about and I'll tell you what it's it's very comprehensive fanboy service because not only do you have all these
808493	816039	These characters, you have all the stickers, which, I mean, like, I think I got a sticker today for Mouser, one of the bosses in Super Mario 2.
816419	818641	I mean, there's some, like, obscure shit in those things.
818661	823245	Like, I was getting things from Advance Wars I'd never even heard of, because I didn't play a lot of that series.
823425	826368	It's just Nintendo fanboy wet dream, this game is.
826508	829971	And you know what, even if you're not, like, a Super Nintendo fanboy, it's a great party game.
830231	834514	Which, duh, it's a Wii game, and the Wii has a lot of great party games, and this is no exception.
834815	836496	Because I was playing a little bit, three players...
836860	837641	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
862074	865495	I want to point out that we have a friend code thread over on our forums.
865535	874398	I'm going to add everybody on there later today and try to maybe bring out Justin TV this evening and try to fight some folks, Orange Launch Radio listeners.
874698	880220	Yes, and we can use my map if I can swap it with somebody because, you know, I made a cool map.
880580	881421	It's called the Cage Match.
882861	883401	Ah, nice.
883581	884322	I see what you did there.
884982	885242	All right.
886066	888909	Uh, let's see, what else do I want to talk about my game of the week?
888949	902442	Really quickly, I want to mention Triggerheart Excelica, because I think a lot of people, like, totally skipped this game, because it was an Xbox Live Arcade release, but I'll tell you what, if you like your Japanese shooters, this is as cliche of a Japanese shooter as they come.
902522	903023	I mean, this is...
903363	903683	DarkSakura
933763	934444	I did.
934984	936545	Have you ever heard of this one, Trigger Heart Accelica?
936725	936945	Yes.
937865	938346	It's good time.
938386	944829	If you like that, I was going to say in April there's Castle of Shikigami 3 is coming out on the Wii.
945069	946910	That'll be another good one.
947450	949832	I think it's definitely worth a look, Trigger Heart Accelica.
950152	952893	I did not spend the money on the full purchase, but I might later on.
953433	958356	Now I'm kind of at the point with Xbox 360 arcade games where either I'm going to buy the damn thing when it comes right out
958752	964634	I'm not going to buy it, or I'm going to wait for them to do a price reduction, because now they've shown that they're willing to do that later.
964654	966695	I bought a bunch of tracks on Rock Band this week.
967555	967855	Like what?
968015	977379	Because I, well, I bought a bunch of the older stuff, because I wanted some other, I left it in my work now, and we have it all set up there so we can play it anytime.
977759	986282	I'm actually buying the official, like, well, someone made them, their official, like, drum, you know, silencer thing, so the drums aren't so
987765	990366	I tried making my own out of mouse pads.
991526	996627	The funny thing about mouse pads is they soak up super glue pretty easy, so it doesn't stick very well.
997948	1003189	So I'm ripping those off and then trying these official ones out.
1003389	1011531	Because while they stuck, they were working pretty good, but after you hit them about 20 times, they fell right off.
1012951	1013191	Oh well.
1017583	1017963	Alright.
1020005	1023388	I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my gaming week that I want to talk about.
1023408	1023968	I don't think there is.
1024048	1024769	I think that's really it.
1025470	1027511	Obviously Smash Brothers took a large chunk of my time.
1027551	1031174	As I'm sure for many of you out there who own a Wii, it's taking up a lot of your time as well.
1031214	1034637	I love the demos that they have for the virtual console games.
1035217	1039621	I laugh though because they show you how long the demo is for each one.
1040109	1041411	Ice Climbers, 40 seconds.
1041451	1042952	That's all you get to play of Ice Climbers.
1043593	1045636	You can do a lot in 40 seconds in Ice Climbers.
1045856	1047318	40 seconds is long enough to beat the first level.
1048379	1050281	I thought the demos were a nice touch.
1050561	1052243	I was kind of hoping you would unlock more.
1052323	1053104	I don't know if you do yet.
1053705	1053945	Do you?
1054025	1054246	Yeah.
1054466	1055267	Oh, I haven't seen...
1055674	1057895	because one of my friends marathoned it last night.
1057915	1059235	I haven't seen if he unlocked anything else.
1059275	1060756	I imagine you have to unlock a couple others.
1060776	1066498	I have to look at my Japanese one, too, because I've got, I think, Mother 2 or Mother 3.
1067598	1069459	Not Mother 3, but Mother 2, I think, is on there.
1069639	1069879	Huh.
1070499	1072760	That may be cool because that means we might have Earthbound on ours.
1073240	1073460	No.
1073900	1074180	Damn it.
1074380	1075821	That was exclusive for Japan.
1075981	1076281	All right.
1076921	1078422	Well, then we should get something exclusive.
1078462	1079442	That's not fair.
1079462	1081103	Nintendo.
1081563	1081843	All right.
1082969	1083970	Metal Gear Solid!
1084790	1088512	It's kind of shown, though, that they can do a virtual console demo.
1089133	1091114	Time limited, but it works, right?
1091294	1092614	Yeah, they're just assholes, that's all.
1097164	1098345	Anyhow, let's see.
1098405	1101027	Let's get to tonight's housekeeping before we get to tonight's news.
1101248	1104571	And I guess I already said the one thing I wanted to say on housekeeping tonight.
1104871	1109075	We do have a friend code thread going on on the forums at orangelaunchradio.com.
1109455	1114880	So we will be having some OL Army tournaments and things like that because lots of people love Smash Brothers.
1115220	1116762	I know lots of our listeners are into this series.
1116802	1118103	I'm sure tons of you have picked up the game.
1118784	1120245	So check it out at orangelaunchradio.com.
1120285	1120986	Click on the forums.
1121624	1124125	and you can probably get 64 friend codes on that list.
1124185	1130328	And make sure if you are adding people on Brawl that you're also adding them on your system in case we want to swap levels around.
1130668	1147255	Because as far as I'm aware, I'm not sure if you can drop them onto the SD memory cards, but I don't know if those things are linked to a certain system or not because Nintendo is an asshole, so they really don't want anything to work correctly, so
1148109	1148790	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1167682	1171785	DMN wants me to plug something he's doing too, which is the OLR March Madness.
1172085	1175227	We'll be talking more about that during the live-only bonus segment tonight.
1175587	1183692	But if you want to participate in choosing the best video game of all time, as chosen by our listeners, check out our forums as well in the STFU forum.
1183732	1187754	That's DMN's show, and there's more information on how you can send your votes in and all that good stuff.
1189175	1190756	So are we ready to get into some gaming news?
1191456	1191817	Why not?
1192037	1192897	All right, I think so.
1192917	1194198	Why don't you start us off, Loki?
1194887	1198490	Alright, this isn't a big surprise, because the same thing happened in Japan when Smash Bros.
1198550	1199531	was released there.
1200471	1203854	Some Wii systems are having trouble reading Smash Bros.
1203914	1222528	Brawl, because, first off, it's the first dual-layer disc for, or dual-layer Wii game on the system, and there was an update, I believe, on the disc to update your system to be able to play those dual-layer discs, and because of that, you know, it takes a little bit more, I guess...
1223058	1234932	Refine Laser to see the data on the disc and they're claiming that some of the Wii systems are kind of dusty and dirty so they will not be able to play Brawl.
1235873	1243182	So if you run into that problem you're supposed to send your system in to Nintendo and they will fix the problem or clean your disc.
1243832	1244774	Drive or something like that.
1244934	1247098	Vacuum out the insides of your Wii or something.
1247659	1248641	Something to that effect.
1248881	1252487	Do you think there might be any... I mean, you're the type of... You're a homebrew kind of guy.
1252507	1256254	Do you think there's any home remedies that someone could try that... Now, obviously, you know...
1256874	1258194	Don't void your warranty or whatever.
1259655	1263376	If somebody out there happens to be getting this problem, is there anything they could try that wouldn't damage their Wii?
1263596	1265637	It'd be hard because that disk drive is kind of funky.
1266377	1268818	Maybe a CD cleaner or something like that.
1268998	1270459	Or a DVD cleaner.
1270519	1272019	How effective are those CD cleaner things?
1272079	1276201	It's just basically a CD with brushes on it.
1276221	1277641	You know what I was just thinking?
1277661	1279122	Does the Wii even play CDs?
1279422	1280142	It doesn't, does it?
1280803	1281063	No.
1282783	1283784	I don't know why I was thinking that.
1283804	1284764	I'm just kind of like, I don't think it
1286804	1287124	I don't know.
1288485	1290366	My system wasn't dusty at all.
1290466	1295029	And I mean, to be honest, there isn't really a lot of places for it to get dusty.
1295069	1296851	I mean, that drive isn't really open that much.
1296891	1298912	And there's just there's, you know, kind of.
1300365	1301866	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1324212	1326114	You bust it open and take a shot back after it.
1326594	1329436	Really, there isn't a whole lot of intake.
1330037	1343108	There's like a tiny little fan in that thing anyways, and I don't really see how there could be a lot of dust sitting on your laser unless you're putting in discs that have been sitting out in the air and just like are caked with dust and you throw it in your system.
1343388	1344629	Then that's your own damn fault.
1344810	1349754	Either way, it's probably your own damn fault that they don't play, so that's...
1350236	1352458	I want to mention this comment in chat.
1352498	1358883	It's completely random, but when you talk about smoke, I couldn't help but think about the Rock Band Stage Kit.
1377384	1378085	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1400885	1403147	That's how it's able to work with both systems.
1403187	1410772	So if I want to get some of my ABBA karaoke CDs and put them on my CD player and use the Rock Band Stage Kit to do like an epic version of Chiquiquita, I could do that?
1411052	1411653	Yes, you can.
1411753	1412093	Sweet.
1416619	1421522	Alright, also, speaking of epic on your Wii, we love it when new channels come out for the Wii.
1421582	1423923	Too bad this wasn't for us, it's for the folks in Japan.
1423983	1427806	It's the Teribi Notomo channel, that would be TV Friend.
1428166	1430247	The TV Friend channel came out on the Wii this week.
1430307	1435270	It's basically, like, imagine the TV Guide channel on American TV, that's kind of what they're getting on the Wii.
1435770	1443595	Hence why they say it may not come out here, because of the fact that, you know, here in America, on your cable, you already have a TV Guide channel.
1443615	1444175	It is pretty cool, though.
1444195	1445876	And, you know, we have TV Guide and all that stuff.
1446571	1450274	and plus now with TiVo and cables got it built in.
1450294	1458940	The thing about this though that was really cool at least from the video that I saw of it is that you can look at multiple days so you can see what's on a whole week.
1459160	1467166	Usually some of those you have to kind of keep progressing hour by hour and kind of move along the thing to see what's on the next day and stuff like that.
1467526	1473410	This you can be like a whole 3D thing and it'll turn it to the side and you can select different days out and stuff like that.
1473470	1473890	That's kind of cool.
1474631	1475832	Does it have a globe I can spin?
1476693	1477713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1500228	1502149	I don't think that it's necessary.
1502649	1504810	I'm glad that they have it over there, but we don't really need it here.
1504830	1508032	It'd be neat, but... Couldn't you say the same thing about the news channel, though?
1508992	1510113	And the forecast channel, really?
1510473	1516436	Is that you can get all that shit on the internet, or you can watch the nightly news, or you can, I don't know, read a newspaper.
1517676	1519397	It just depends on what you use more.
1520958	1521458	I guess that's true.
1521478	1523599	Did you see the other cool thing you can do with this?
1523839	1523979	What?
1525365	1530609	When you find your channel or whatever, you can actually use your Wii Remote as a universal remote with your TV.
1532730	1535152	I was going to get to that, but that's alright.
1535633	1537714	Yeah, the Wii Remote is going to be like a universal remote.
1537734	1540697	You can also change channels, do the volume and all that stuff.
1540717	1542458	You can switch between Wii and TV inputs.
1543219	1546321	But it's some type of hack that you use with the sensor bar.
1547542	1552967	Basically, I think what it does is it... I don't know if it causes the...
1554449	1554689	I.R.
1554709	1557670	to bounce off of the sensor bar and bounce off your head or something like that.
1557710	1560551	But when I say hack, it's an official Nintendo thing.
1560591	1563091	It's not like people are hacking their systems to do it.
1563171	1564432	It's a Nintendo-endorsed hack.
1564932	1569973	So that's kind of neat, though, that they're hacking their own stuff to do weird purposes.
1570233	1573054	I don't know why that strikes me as so amusing, but it does.
1573614	1574214	So there you go.
1575055	1583537	Also, what's kind of interesting, you can stamp programs that you're interested in, and then you can share them with either other Wii users or you can send them to Wii Friends.
1585038	1588381	and Nintendo calculates popularity scores based on what's been bookmarked.
1589101	1590342	So, kind of interesting.
1590703	1600670	I do like the fact that they are kind of trying to turn the Wii into a one-stop shop, even though news and forecast and TV and all that is something you can get on the computer anyway.
1601111	1604253	I kind of think it's a neat idea to have it all right there on your TV.
1604713	1605414	It's interesting.
1605594	1610938	And I mean, I know it's something that's available out there right now and other things, but it's free.
1611198	1614541	So, I mean, even if you don't use it, it's at least there for you.
1615582	1616563	Same with the news channel.
1616683	1620865	I don't read it at all, but if you want to, you can.
1623206	1627509	It's better, too, to have more stuff to fill your little blank TV screens with on your Wii.
1627549	1629870	Doesn't that feel good, to fill in those screens?
1630190	1633892	No, I'm almost out of memory on my Wii system.
1633992	1635313	What happens when we run out of space?
1635473	1637414	Because you only get four screens to play with.
1637514	1640996	I'm like, I'm seriously, I probably have maybe ten screens left.
1641076	1641336	Really?
1641356	1641476	Really?
1641803	1648465	Yeah, you have to delete stuff, and then when you run out of space on the actual unit, you have to put stuff on SD memory cards.
1648485	1651586	I bet you anything Nintendo is going to do something about the memory space this winter.
1651626	1653686	They have to for all this WiiWare stuff coming out.
1653706	1654227	Right.
1654247	1655487	I don't think so.
1655547	1657147	No, they're stubborn bastards.
1657167	1657668	They won't do it.
1657828	1660168	Yeah, Frisbee says external hard drive channel.
1661169	1663189	External hard drive channel.
1664270	1664890	Exactly.
1665250	1667811	The SD card management channel, even though it's in the system.
1668131	1669291	But something that can just...
1670217	1675499	It would not be that hard to have the Wii read off the SD card just like it does its own internal memory.
1684056	1685036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1713047	1716770	Okay, that's what the Wii Shop channel feels like, is Prodigy Online.
1716790	1718151	Ooh, low blow.
1718451	1718791	I know.
1721253	1722874	You want to know a true story about Prodigy?
1723394	1723674	What?
1723734	1725496	Prodigy's where it all started for me, dude.
1725516	1728298	If I did not have Prodigy, this show would not exist.
1728458	1731520	That was my first gateway drug to the internet, was Prodigy.
1731620	1732581	I remember Prodigy.
1734802	1738905	I used to have on the forums, I actually had a Nintendo Help thread, and I would help
1739451	1740471	Prodigy Chat Prodigy Chat
1764963	1765063	Wow.
1765083	1765163	Wow.
1765183	1765263	Nice.
1765523	1765623	Nice.
1790080	1792902	No, AOL was always kind of the devil to people on Prodigy.
1793302	1799567	And if anyone wants to know who I was, I was CNW Allura for the Cartoon Network chat back in the day.
1799967	1803489	Do you think someone's honestly going to listen to this and be all like, I remember her?
1804090	1804890	Hey, watch.
1804930	1806291	I did a whole bunch on that.
1806631	1807112	So I don't care.
1807132	1807992	Who knows it was me?
1809733	1813836	Dartitsuya in chat says, Sky, you wanted to grow up to be a Nintendo game counselor?
1814176	1818720	Dude, wasn't that like all of our dreams in junior high school until we realized...
1819699	1821520	Never have that dream.
1822421	1822721	Ever.
1823281	1825563	But you can play video games for a living.
1827044	1828324	And get paid for it.
1829345	1829865	No.
1832147	1833287	Alright, let's go ahead.
1833327	1835369	I'm trying to help stupid people get through the game.
1835669	1836730	How do I get more?
1836990	1839191	Push the A button.
1840872	1841893	It's not working.
1842133	1843394	Turn on your system.
1843654	1845475	I bet there were some real dopes that called in.
1845635	1846155	Anyway, sorry.
1846696	1847016	Anyway.
1847831	1855737	Um, for more Wii news and not AOL or Prodigy, which we, you know, we called, um, never mind.
1856338	1859200	I love that we are on the cutting edge of technology here on this show.
1859581	1860761	Remember, Prodigy?
1863163	1863404	Sorry?
1864925	1865625	CompuSuck.
1866526	1867767	And any people who use that.
1870527	1875730	Okami Wii is actually getting a later release date than was anticipated.
1876150	1879572	They originally said March 25th, but it's going to be April 15th.
1880752	1882413	So get ready to play it then.
1883394	1885275	Capcom doesn't really want to tell us why.
1889657	1889777	No.
1890017	1892259	It's not like there isn't a version of Okami already out there.
1892819	1895000	So I think a little wait won't kill anybody.
1896186	1899868	I'll tell you why it's not coming out on the 25th, because it's not done.
1900169	1900589	I don't know.
1901670	1909155	Maybe, you know what, you know why games get delayed, surprisingly, they fail QA, or they fail the little seal of approval check and all that stuff.
1909315	1911076	Yeah, the seal of approval of anything.
1911116	1919642	No, but, no, these games, don't the games have to be okay, like, Xbox 360 games have to go through, like, a Microsoft certification process, Nintendo games have to go through something similar, maybe it failed.
1920042	1920462	Really?
1920482	1921003	Yeah.
1921463	1926166	You mean they actually put these, like, shitty Destiny games through that same, you know, Nintendo seal of approval?
1926286	1926969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1932944	1933724	Yes and no.
1934165	1939467	I have heard of the fact that sometimes gaming companies say they don't want these games to come out on their system.
1939507	1940368	I've heard of that happening.
1940648	1948492	But the other thing is that for every Xbox game, you have to refer to the little X button as the guide button.
1948572	1951053	Your A's have to be colored like the A button and all that stuff.
1951093	1953234	Somebody actually goes through and makes sure the game is compliant.
1953455	1958137	So I bet you anything with Okami, somebody missed something and a PlayStation 2 character came over and they had to go back and fix it.
1958397	1961039	Oh, I'm glad that they fixed those little details.
1961079	1969903	I have absolutely nothing to back that up, but sometimes these are why games get unexpectedly delayed, and if they're not saying anything about it, you never know.
1970123	1970824	Who cares?
1970984	1972625	I mean, eh.
1973325	1976507	There's nothing coming out in April anyways, at least not in the first half.
1977361	1978241	So it's the only thing.
1978541	1981822	It's the top title of the first half of April now.
1982062	1986963	I'm going over to chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and just a completely random comment kind of out of thin air.
1987003	1988223	I guess it must have been on another topic.
1988723	1992204	Gripper01 in chat says, I'm stuck on the second boss on Lost Odyssey.
1992304	1992724	It's hard.
1993124	1995884	And Lost Odyssey does have some pretty tough bosses in it.
1995904	2001265	But you know what's really funny is like you'll notice in my gaming week, as much of a love fest as I was having with Lost Odyssey last week, I didn't even play it.
2001305	2002145	I didn't touch it this week.
2002565	2006406	My roommate comes up to me yesterday and goes, did you stop playing Lost Odyssey?
2007392	2008132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2037259	2040063	Yeah, you just have to keep casting spells against it.
2040103	2043547	I think it's based on fire, so water spells maybe?
2044788	2045089	Yeah?
2046130	2047171	Yeah, water spells.
2047291	2047892	I don't remember.
2048333	2050435	And then after you kill the first one, there's a second one that comes.
2051617	2054220	Alright, well, let's go ahead and move on with the news.
2055834	2056154	Spectator Mode
2085203	2100110	as well as there's going to be some other cool stuff you can do like being able to download ghost data, daily missions, kind of like the mission mode in Mario Kart DS, and what else?
2100211	2100791	Let's see.
2103092	2104133	That's pretty much it.
2104453	2108575	But I like the fact that you can do spectator mode while you're waiting for races and stuff.
2108595	2109115	That's kind of neat.
2111713	2116877	I think it's interesting, Nintendo's strategy here, to create a whole separate channel kind of dedicated to one of their games.
2116957	2118238	I actually think it's kind of a neat idea.
2119479	2119699	Yeah.
2119799	2128846	I mean, you gotta hand it to Nintendo at least for this much, is that as pretty rad as the Xbox 360 is with its online stuff, it doesn't have a lot like this.
2129086	2130107	With the exception of
2130894	2137600	Stuff like Halo 3 that has their very comprehensive website with obscenely detailed game statistics.
2138260	2141243	It's kind of neat to see Nintendo doing something actually integrated on the Wii.
2141503	2142043	It's neat.
2142203	2147068	They can't do something integrated on the whole system.
2147228	2151131	I don't care if each one of these games has another channel that adds on to it.
2151718	2155200	That's fine with me, because I'm not playing like 20 games at a time.
2155240	2158462	And especially the AAA titles, you know, that you know tons of people are getting.
2158702	2168407	And I don't know what you guys have heard about the midnight launches from around the country, but just looking at some of the various gaming blogs, talking to one of my friends that was working at one of the stores, it sounds like packed.
2168548	2170929	It sounds like these midnight sales are absolutely packed for Smash Bros.
2172120	2183527	Actually, Dan, of course you know my husband manages a game, Crazy, and he was saying that what was packed was the tournament he ran and not so much the midnight sale.
2184388	2186789	So people were just going for the tournament and didn't even bother to buy the game?
2187370	2187710	Pretty much.
2187950	2188491	That's weird.
2190052	2190412	I don't know.
2191052	2192333	I think he'll pick it up eventually.
2192633	2194895	He said it really thinned out when it came time for the launch.
2195555	2195815	Huh.
2196376	2197596	Maybe it was past all their bedtimes.
2197676	2198537	Maybe they're coming back today.
2199204	2199544	Maybe.
2199564	2204286	I mean, I just say it doesn't matter what time they do a launch, pre-order your copy, you'll get it.
2205066	2205266	True.
2205306	2210688	Maybe they didn't have money at the time, maybe they're just waiting to pick it up later on, because, I mean, it's not like it's going to be hard to find, I don't think.
2210828	2214069	I hate calling it pre-ordering, because really you're just reserving.
2214769	2215529	It's a deposit.
2215669	2216009	Ordering.
2216309	2217410	Yeah, reserve your copy.
2217930	2221511	Let's Have Tea says, there were over 300 kids at the one I went to.
2222071	2226172	GS68 says, I was at the GameStop in Santa Clara this morning and the line was going around the store.
2227553	2227693	Hmm.
2229804	2232147	And they've got some good stuff coming up, you know, with Mario Kart next.
2232167	2233589	I mean, it's not a bad thing to follow.
2247659	2248460	Survival Horror Puzzler
2262170	2262670	Thank you for watching!
2279830	2281171	and it's being made for WiiWare.
2281251	2288416	Lit is going to be about this character Jake and he's trapped in a high school and there's evil creatures all around the high school and he's trying to find his girlfriend Rachel.
2289276	2292238	This is WayForward's first original IP since Shantae.
2293199	2299023	Lit is going to have horror elements, boss battles and the developers are expecting this to be a big game.
2300244	2301865	And the concept art looks kind of neat.
2303722	2311347	I'm curious how a survival horror puzzler plays out, but those are two of my favorite genres, so the marriage of them can't be entirely a bad thing, right Jamie?
2311708	2316991	It's gonna have cutscenes where you walk through and you meet a zombie that says, hey, let's puzzle to get past this door.
2317011	2319793	Like in Kirby's Avalanche.
2319873	2320934	Or like Puzzle Quest.
2321935	2323616	It's like playing Puyo Puyo.
2324502	2331085	Yes, as if, you know, a puzzle quest survivor horror game, I'm sure would be well accepted.
2331286	2334307	So, wait, how would, like, Resident Evil puzzler work?
2334347	2337949	You know, solve this puzzle, or a chainsaw man's gonna come after you?
2337969	2338950	It's like Puzzle Pirates.
2341585	2342885	Silly Rob, there's no chainsaw.
2343025	2343805	Yeah, there is, isn't there?
2343986	2344706	Yeah, hello.
2344786	2346206	It's like the scariest guy in the game.
2346246	2349627	The guy with the chainsaw on the first stage that runs up to you and just chops your head right off.
2349647	2357348	They should totally make another puzzle fighter game and just throw in characters from Resident Evil in there and you can have a chainsaw man, old chibi style.
2358349	2360889	Yeah, that'd be awesome.
2361389	2363550	We need Silent Hill vs. Resident Evil, the fighting game.
2364670	2365170	That'd be rad.
2366221	2369643	Actdeft dares to say that Pac-Man is a survival horror puzzler.
2370163	2374046	I mean, you do have to solve the puzzle of every maze, and you are running from ghosts, right?
2377448	2377548	Oh!
2379069	2380029	That reminded me of something.
2380169	2380510	What's that?
2380990	2387274	I just noticed this while we were watching Tron last week, that you can see Pac-Man in the background of one of the levels of Sark.
2387634	2388174	End of line.
2388535	2389475	Sorry, I had to mention that.
2389675	2390176	Oh, that's fine.
2390536	2392437	I always appreciate the random Tron reference.
2393838	2394158	I just...
2394924	2397366	I was saying random video game reference, but still.
2397386	2399528	Did anyone pick up Disks of Tron?
2399808	2400108	No.
2401109	2404472	I played the demo, and I was like, God damn, this game was cool, and I was seven.
2404952	2405853	I know, right?
2406513	2408815	And it still wasn't as cool as the other one.
2409535	2409736	Yeah.
2410676	2414339	Disks of Tron was better in the movie, although I am still all for it.
2414359	2415840	Was that you who said that on the show, or Jamie?
2415860	2416241	I don't remember.
2416461	2418222	Somebody said they should make it a ride at Disneyland.
2418582	2420164	Disks of Tron should be a ride at Disneyland.
2420184	2420884	That was probably Jamie.
2420904	2422325	Will you fall through the floor?
2422345	2423166	I'd never say anything like that.
2424315	2426895	I think I was talking about the people who were having the Tron part.
2427236	2428516	Why can't they do it with the Wii?
2428856	2432897	Like, you know, you could use your Wii remote like throwing a Frisbee or something.
2433257	2434037	That would be cool.
2434237	2435037	I know, right?
2435697	2438298	That would be awesome, which is why it will never exist.
2439998	2440958	All right, let's move on.
2442538	2443539	So Tron is coming out.
2443579	2443979	No, I'm kidding.
2445199	2446999	How do you suggest a ride for Disneyland?
2447119	2448660	Does Disneyland have a suggestion box?
2448920	2450300	I think you have to be an Imagineer.
2451656	2453097	Who's an Imagineer at Disneyland?
2453377	2458141	We know people that work for Disney and listen to this program because every time Jamie and I talk about our big Disney whoredom.
2458421	2462004	Okay, so like Disney friends of Orange Lounge Radio, you have to make this happen.
2462044	2463405	We want a Tron experience.
2463445	2465727	I don't care if the movie's like 20 years old.
2466108	2466888	It's still all kinds of rad.
2466908	2467709	I have a Tron shirt.
2468510	2468930	Exactly.
2468970	2469570	Tron is rad.
2470671	2472092	Of course, you have to get it in the vault.
2472693	2479238	All they'll do is they'll just like, what the trend has been lately is updating their rides with different movies tied to them.
2479278	2480199	You know, like the whole
2480819	2482980	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2512801	2518685	SSJ100 Matt in response to How to Make Rides at Disney in chat says, Sky, you need a special degree in fun.
2519826	2521647	They didn't offer fun as a major in my college.
2521667	2522528	I'm kind of disappointed.
2523689	2526791	Rob says, Rob with two B's says, Teacups of Tron.
2529252	2530433	Okay, we're getting too random.
2530453	2531954	Please, Jamie, give us a story.
2532134	2532515	Save us.
2532555	2534496	Like I said, Tron's coming out on the Nintendo.
2534556	2534916	No, I'm kidding.
2534976	2535396	Shut up.
2536097	2540180	Famitsu has said that Tron... I can't do that.
2540300	2540500	Okay.
2540520	2540600	Okay.
2541670	2552656	Famitsu reported that Disgaea will be out on the Nintendo DS in Japan, titled Disgaea Prince of the Demon World.
2552756	2563882	There's not much really else about it, but it's been rumored that it's actually a port of the original Disgaea Hour of Darkness.
2565703	2569985	And apparently unlockable in it is, you know, the teacups of Tron.
2570871	2571472	Shut up!
2574293	2577776	I guess that's kind of cool though, Disgaea on the DS, because now you can take it with you everywhere you go.
2578236	2579117	And you can touch them.
2579397	2585541	And in order to level up to 9,999 levels, which is an insane amount, you probably would have to take it with you everywhere you go.
2588403	2592505	The Japanese, what, sorry, Ross Steel UT in chat made it funny.
2592846	2597769	He says, in other news, Disgaea has been announced for cell phones, Xbox 360s, and teacups.
2599361	2626885	The Japanese WiiWare promo page has been launched, and they're showing off, I guess, the 11 launch titles that they're going to have for it, including Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Young King, and The Promised Land, Star Soldier R, a remake of Star Soldier, which looks pretty awesome, World Puzzle Mojipitan, I don't even know how to pronounce that, Mojipitan Wii, Pokemon Ranch,
2627679	2631181	Dr. Mario's Virus Buster, which looks kind of neat.
2631281	2631601	I don't know.
2631641	2634182	I guess you shoot blocks or something.
2634202	2634683	I don't know.
2634823	2638985	Or I'm thinking it might just be a port of Dr. Mario that might be playable online.
2639205	2641806	It looks like you're firing something.
2642526	2642867	I don't know.
2643847	2644387	But cool.
2646088	2646609	Let's see.
2646829	2648790	Marubo Shikaku.
2648810	2650270	I have no idea what that is.
2650911	2654773	Magnetica, which was that ripoff of Zuma.
2656874	2657454	Bomberman.
2658943	2665865	Looks like Okiraku Ping Pong Wii, and Angel Solitaire.
2666005	2667606	Ooh, hooray, ping pong on the Wii.
2667766	2668506	I'm so excited.
2668706	2669507	That's never been done.
2670087	2672508	And Joy Sound Wii.
2673208	2674268	I have no idea what that is either.
2675028	2676409	Maybe a music-based game for the Wii?
2677269	2677829	Maybe.
2678170	2678490	I don't know.
2678830	2682291	But they had some screenshots up of some different things.
2684052	2684532	Looks like...
2687850	2689531	Dr. Mario game looks pretty cool.
2690071	2691251	I guess that's Star Soldier.
2691291	2693732	That middle one is Star Soldier.
2694132	2695812	And then the bottom one is Magnetica.
2697012	2700833	Does the website have any information about where you're going to store all this stuff?
2702054	2702434	I don't know.
2703074	2709695	I heard a rumor, though, that Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game was going to take up all your memory.
2710316	2710636	I don't know.
2710676	2711336	It's stupid, though.
2711396	2711976	It's so crazy.
2713432	2714532	Oh my god, that's creepy.
2714692	2715873	That Pokemon game.
2716393	2717053	I know.
2717633	2719174	It's so creepy looking.
2720934	2723395	Some of the other games, I don't know what that puzzle game is.
2723595	2726075	There's another one that kind of looks like Sudoku, but it's not.
2727215	2728396	Crystal Chronicles looks good.
2728416	2728976	I don't know.
2729076	2730596	I'm pretty impressed so far.
2731476	2737898	I'm actually sort of looking forward to Star Soldier R, but really there's only one good thing to me that has come out of the Star Soldier franchise.
2738138	2738458	Which is?
2738658	2739358	Star Parodia.
2740959	2742059	You and your Parodius love.
2742398	2743038	Pac-Man vs. Pac-Man
2767499	2772362	Pac-Man Versus was a game where you could like its big niche was that you could actually play as the ghost.
2773402	2775643	Well, somebody else is kind of taking an idea like that.
2775683	2777945	Let's take a classic arcade game, but like reverse it.
2778305	2780306	And the classic game is Space Invaders.
2780966	2781326	Rad.
2781487	2782107	Now, here's the thing.
2782367	2785048	Space Invaders Extreme is actually kind of sexy.
2785229	2786329	Like, I don't know if you've played it.
2786449	2788110	Like, I remember Loki brought on the show.
2788410	2791632	Space Invaders Extreme is kind of like Luminous meets Space Invaders, which is
2791952	2793754	Space Invaders Get Even
2809654	2817160	and in this game you will be in control of up to 300 Space Invaders and you get to do death and destruction on human people.
2817260	2818961	Looks like Pikmin, sort of.
2819201	2820062	I guess, yeah.
2820202	2822024	It's been compared to Pikmin and Rampage.
2822124	2823325	Oh wow, they're all sprightly.
2824165	2836315	No idea yet if it is an actual game, like disc game, or if it's a WiiWare game, but either way I say yes to more Space Invaders nostalgia, because they really did a good job with Extreme, and this looks kind of fun too.
2837636	2839237	So, I'm all for a
2839741	2840502	Kirby 64 The Crystal Shards
2869651	2872793	which like the title suggests was a Nintendo 64 game.
2872813	2876215	It's a thousand Wii points or seven pounds.
2877596	2883359	And it's a lot of Kirby 3D joy and running around and, you know, sucking, I guess.
2885080	2893946	So also coming out is Psychosis, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, 600 Wii points.
2894006	2894106	And
2898277	2911289	Basically, this game had a really cool premise, I thought, that you were entering your own mind as a spaceship to get rid of something that's invaded your mind.
2911389	2912570	So it's sort of like R-Type.
2914051	2921338	However, it's got this sort of surrealist pattern to it.
2922899	2923440	It's pretty cool.
2924561	2924701	Huh.
2926957	2928758	Are these games that you would pay money to re-download?
2929878	2931739	Well, Psychosis, maybe.
2931959	2933819	Oh, and there's another one that I'd probably get.
2934079	2934380	What's that?
2934580	2939061	Super Turrigan, which was an SNES game.
2939261	2947124	It's 800 points for a virtual console, and it's basically just run-and-shoot stuff.
2947744	2948524	It's a side-scroller.
2948744	2950745	Wasn't that this week's release here, Loki?
2951365	2951865	I can't remember.
2952025	2955146	Actually, the lists I've got are just ones coming out this month.
2955167	2955887	Oh, that's all right.
2957270	2960533	This month, at least from Sega, we're going to get two titles from them.
2961153	2965497	One of them is Puyo Puyo 2, so that should be pretty cool.
2965957	2973743	And the other one is Powerball, which does not have anything to do with the lotto, unfortunately.
2974684	2976666	It's like a hybrid of rugby and football.
2979028	2979548	Interesting.
2979768	2980969	That's kind of neat, I guess.
2981189	2985793	Both of those, I believe, were Genesis titles, so if I remember correctly, I think like 800 Wii points?
2987256	2988097	Puyo Puyo 2
3017971	3018471	Puyo Puyo
3044782	3051604	But you have to use strategy to, you know, cripple your opponent, too.
3051705	3056566	I mean, it's the same concept that you get in Puzzle Fighter, which is why I also like Puzzle Fighter a whole lot.
3057286	3060648	But when I, my very first P.O.P.O.
3060668	3069151	that I played was Kirby's Avalanche, and it was just... I still have my copy, my original copy, that I bought when it was new.
3069331	3072892	I think I do in my big gaming archive somewhere, so...
3073700	3081502	But I mean, as far as puzzlers go, I think that was one of the big ones to really, you know, make that competitive fun edge in a puzzle game.
3082162	3085903	DJ Dark Knight in chat says, I wish the newer Puyo Puyo for the DS was stateside.
3085923	3087663	I thought we did have a DS Puyo Puyo.
3088223	3090224	Or is there like a newer version that came out in Japan?
3090444	3091024	I guess there must be.
3091884	3093964	Well, we got Puyo Pop, I think.
3094204	3096785	Yeah, which is okay.
3096865	3101106	I still actually need to go back and get Puyo Puyo Sun on Saturn.
3101586	3101706	Hmm.
3103858	3107106	DJ Dark Knight says the newer one is on Wi-Fi.
3107588	3108209	That's pretty rad.
3108831	3109472	That's really cool.
3109653	3110255	That is very cool.
3111196	3118902	Well, since we talked about virtual console releases, let's talk about some things that are going to be sold in a more traditional format this week and travel around the world and talk about the release dates.
3119282	3120583	I'll start off with Japan tonight.
3120724	3125347	Xbox 360 in Japan is getting Skate on March 13th from Electronic Arts.
3126068	3132012	Moving on to other systems in Japan, PlayStation 3 also getting Skate, but they're also getting Winning Post 7 Maximum 2008.
3132633	3135955	I'm not actually sure what kind of sport that is.
3135975	3136776	Winning Post?
3136976	3137576	It's horse racing.
3137596	3138157	Yeah, I was going to say.
3139478	3139618	So...
3140543	3147090	It's still not Derby Owner's Club or Final Furlong, which will always be one of my favorite arcade games.
3147110	3149132	Final Furlong is Hump a Horse.
3149152	3152415	I thought they had some horse racing games on the Wii in Japan.
3152435	3154978	I wish those were coming over here.
3154998	3155418	That'd be funny.
3155538	3160543	Well, I'm assuming that there must be six other games in this particular series, seeing as they have a seven in it.
3163124	3169108	On the Nintendo Wii, also winning post-7 maximum 2008, which must be kind of fun on the Wii, I imagine.
3170249	3174352	The Wii controls are what I imagine they are, where you actually would get to whip your horse with the remote.
3174833	3175193	Mush!
3176054	3177555	I remember when you had Politary.
3178215	3178616	The horse?
3178836	3179396	Yeah.
3179436	3180717	Derby Owners Club, good times.
3181037	3181618	I miss that game.
3182179	3182820	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3203234	3204535	Transformers The Game Nintendo Wii Japan
3223229	3227592	If you haven't heard yet, you shouldn't buy this game, because it sucks.
3227752	3231395	Well, here's something that they're saying does not suck, and it's actually all kinds of cool.
3231735	3238560	Baroque on the Wii makes its way in Japan this week, and that is our role-playing game that's going to be pretty hot.
3238700	3240061	A few more weeks, we're going to get that, too.
3240081	3245485	Yeah, it is coming out here, but if you want to get an early sneak peek and you can understand Japanese, you might want to import that.
3245565	3246866	Or if you live in Japan, check it out.
3247486	3248907	PlayStation 2, guess what?
3248967	3250728	Winning post 7, also on PlayStation 2.
3251489	3252390	Also this week on March 13th.
3253556	3257737	Where would we be without a Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle Orchestra?
3258037	3259097	Woohoo!
3259157	3260538	Oh, it's actually just a price reduction.
3260558	3261338	It's not a new release.
3261518	3261858	My bad.
3261998	3266459	They should do like a new Owen Dunn type game with Neon Genesis.
3266619	3266999	What's that?
3267399	3269180	I have one of the Evangelion games.
3269540	3271320	See, I'm so glad I'm not the only one that does tangents.
3271480	3272901	Yes, Jamie, you have one of the games.
3272941	3273141	What is it?
3273161	3274381	I have one of the ones on Saturn.
3274561	3277862	Not the Steel Girlfriend, but the other one that came out.
3278322	3281323	And all it is is really confusing.
3281363	3282363	It's like a dating sim.
3283475	3291598	If this one's like the others, it's like a dating sim where you play as Shinji and then you choose different things in battle.
3291758	3293659	Then really it's just, oh look, it's shooting.
3293819	3294159	Bang.
3294479	3295640	Oh look, the creature falls.
3295820	3296180	Bang.
3296980	3299822	How could you think about dating now when the world is ending?
3301362	3301842	I don't know.
3302182	3303543	We've seen End of Evangelion.
3304485	3306588	Alright, if I may move on with the releases.
3306608	3311013	There is a new release on PlayStation 2 and it even comes with a limited edition if you want to get it.
3311794	3313997	12 Riven, the Psy Criminal of Integral.
3314958	3315759	That's the name of the game.
3315779	3316640	It's coming out in Japan.
3317933	3320734	Check out the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS.
3321095	3322135	Call of Duty 4.
3322755	3324136	I didn't know they had to wait for this game.
3324176	3326917	Contra Dual Spirits finally comes out in Japan this week.
3328077	3328918	Dual Love.
3328998	3334040	Kosuru Otome wa Shiori no Joshin comes out as well.
3335480	3336561	Lots of titles this week.
3336621	3338241	More stuff in the Simple DS series.
3339282	3339902	Yu-Gi-Oh!
3339982	3341703	Spirit Summoner gets a price reduction.
3342703	3343763	Koinu no Heia.
3345996	3350978	and Kantan Tanoshi Okiyashi Navi DS comes out from Koei.
3351618	3354139	And, oh, this is kind of rad, The Legend of Kage 2.
3355359	3356739	Kage Densetsu comes out.
3356959	3360861	I forgot that they were, I remember now hearing a story about that they were making a sequel to Legend of Kage.
3361201	3361821	That's kind of rad.
3363181	3365482	So, that will be coming out on the Nintendo DS.
3365522	3368623	And lastly, let me see if there's anything of note on the PSP.
3370284	3371324	Oh, Dark Sakura.
3372277	3374679	Parodius Portable gets a price reduction this week.
3375500	3376061	Check that out.
3376941	3379784	Same thing with Salamander Portable and Twinbee Portable.
3380404	3382006	Jamie, you need to go on a shopping spree.
3382226	3383387	You need to go on a shopping spree.
3383927	3388511	No new games, but... I love Twinbee and Parodius and Salamander.
3389192	3394236	Some accessories come out like Easy Pouch Portable and Inner Pouch Portable.
3394637	3397899	If you ever wanted to camouflage Inner Pouch, here's your chance.
3399461	3399541	Uh...
3401052	3401832	Well, let's move on.
3402673	3403053	Please.
3404113	3405754	We've got our UK releases.
3405894	3411656	On the 13th is Sam & Max episode 204, Chariots of the Dogs, on PC.
3412316	3416517	And 14th, Rob's favorite, Build-A-Bear Workshop on the DS.
3416577	3417238	Oh, hooray.
3418218	3420679	That is coming for Wii sometime soon, too.
3420719	3421199	Yay!
3423598	3435151	CSI Hard Evidence, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker, Fish Tycoon, FlatOutHeadOn, Jumper on Wii,
3439500	3452686	Master of Illusion on DS, No More Heroes on Wii, Star Trek Conquest which will be PS2 and Wii, The Spiderwick Chronicles on DS and Turning Point Fall of Liberty on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC.
3453146	3454587	There's another Star Trek game coming out?
3455287	3455787	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3482213	3485034	In the U.S., we're getting some good stuff this week.
3485794	3494495	Of course, today, Smash Bros., if you haven't picked it up yet, or just, I don't know, maybe haven't heard over the last six months, that's coming out today.
3494915	3495255	It has.
3496916	3500836	Later this week, though, we've got some cool stuff, including Condemned 2, Bloodshot.
3500876	3504777	That's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3505457	3510338	If you're in the mood for a light gun game for the Wii, we've got House of the Dead 2 and 3 Returns.
3511269	3512049	Wappen2999 Insecticide ProEvo2008 BuzzJrRoboJam
3538609	3540230	Nanostray 2 Wild Arms XF Wrestling Games
3564708	3572552	WWE Smackdown vs. Raw Superstar Series Buzz, The Hollywood Quiz, Ratchet & Clank Size Matters, World Championship Cards on PSP
3592465	3602988	If you can't wait for the wireless Wii nunchuck adapter, they've got the cord-free wireless adapter for your existing nunchucks.
3603068	3607909	So until the actual wireless nunchuck comes out, that'll, I guess, have to do.
3608689	3618412	And then, unfortunately, I have to mention this, but I believe... No, actually, that may be Monday.
3618512	3621393	Whatever, but coming out next week, or the week after next, I should say,
3622503	3625484	I had Judgment, Biolith, Rebellion 2, Booster Pack.
3626024	3627125	Nice cards for that.
3627525	3629486	We need a million copies to sell, folks.
3633427	3637589	And no, we will not be including the Booster Packs, I'm afraid.
3638349	3639150	Oh, jerk.
3640630	3643531	Never mind, don't buy it.
3643551	3645252	Didn't we get to include the sales of some other game?
3647459	3648580	Was it Let's Be Friends Forever?
3648600	3649141	I don't remember.
3649722	3651784	Was it Let's Ride Friends Forever maybe?
3651824	3652325	I don't remember.
3652405	3654428	I think it may have been Let's Ride Friends Forever.
3654448	3656050	I don't know.
3656070	3657311	Just got to keep track of all these games.
3657792	3658072	All right.
3658653	3659454	Better part of the bet.
3660646	3668013	Well, one game definitely wasn't a part of the bet because it probably would have sold tons of copies and Loki would be running around in a tingle suit before we know it, is Bully.
3668413	3674119	But some people who bought the new version of Bully on the 360 this week apparently were left pretty disappointed.
3674839	3677182	Apparently the game came out and it was buggy.
3677842	3681686	There's audio glitches, frame rate problems, crashes.
3682447	3685710	This game definitely did not really...
3686474	3689656	Do very well in QA or something, or I don't know if they were asleep or what.
3689816	3692057	Or they just said, release it, we'll fix it in a week.
3692557	3693217	Well, who knows?
3693297	3694058	I mean, I don't know.
3694118	3695238	I don't know who's to blame for this.
3695298	3698179	Maybe they were doing it on dev kits or something and something changed.
3698299	3698720	I don't know.
3699400	3703242	But regardless, Rockstar Games has basically come out and made a public apology.
3703902	3705343	Basically just a giant my bad.
3705863	3708644	But they are going to be doing a title update via Xbox Live.
3708664	3711165	They are going to release a patch sometime in the next week.
3712246	3712366	So.
3713290	3720394	No word yet if Rockstar is actually going to be offering a complete replacement program kind of like had to happen for Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii.
3720414	3721894	Probably not, because they're fixing it.
3722115	3723115	They can patch it on 360.
3723175	3730679	The Wii doesn't really have anything built in the place where they can patch that stuff, so that's why they have to do full replacements.
3732239	3734501	Did you pick up Bully by chance?
3734521	3735961	Do you own any version of Bully?
3737142	3738082	No, I don't own Bully.
3738402	3740243	I think I may try it on the Wii.
3740744	3741104	I don't know.
3741164	3741484	We'll see.
3742988	3746051	Does the Wii have all the waggle controls and all that good stuff?
3746071	3748032	It does, and I don't know.
3748212	3750734	I don't really have time to play it right now.
3750794	3751495	That's the problem.
3752515	3754757	Maybe later I'll pick it up when it drops in price some more.
3754937	3757079	Boy, our chat room's full of comedians tonight.
3757139	3760681	Rob with 2B says, Maybe Bully was a typo for Buggy.
3761202	3765645	And Tigerclaw says, The 360 has been bullied from the sounds of it.
3769468	3770769	No two-drink minimum here, folks.
3770989	3771069	Mmm.
3771678	3772479	All for free in chat.
3797319	3825466	um there's also the the actual first game is going to be called Touch Fighter which you use um as a uh I guess like a steering wheel the note on here says it took two weeks to develop so it probably isn't going to be all that great um and then um there's also uh um some talk about worms possibly a port of worms and a few other things so and Apple's going to be making 30 percent of uh
3826181	3829222	Every sale, so that's going to be good news for them.
3830902	3832403	I'm going to have some monkey ball.
3834343	3835283	That sounds so wrong.
3835804	3837664	Gold Banjo calls it eyespore.
3840145	3846426	And, oh man, we unleashed a beast because me reading jokes in chat, just now everything's going downhill now.
3847647	3850888	Son of Dad says eyespore would be an eyesore.
3851808	3851888	Ah!
3854941	3857642	Oh my god, he did not say that, did he?
3858022	3858482	Yes.
3858502	3859702	DarkTetsuya, no.
3860423	3860643	What?
3860763	3862723	I can't talk to you, you don't have an iPhone.
3863343	3865164	Oh, one of Extrofer's quotes?
3865184	3866204	That was in one of his YouTubes.
3867105	3868225	Yeah, it's funny stuff.
3868405	3870265	Anyway, Tangent, hello.
3871186	3871686	That's us.
3872686	3873646	The Tangent cast.
3874327	3882309	So, Bungie, after hearing the story last week about a kid who sent in his Xbox 360 that had been signed by
3883101	3891587	Various members of the Bungie team and also from Rooster Teeth, the folks who do Red vs. Blue.
3892868	3902775	Having it come back completely wiped clean, Bungie has actually rallied together to kind of make up for Microsoft's mistake.
3903515	3905957	And they've, I think, gone a little bit above and beyond.
3906017	3910320	They sent him a full, I don't know, swag...
3910902	3932275	Box, basically, with a signed Halo 3 helmet signed by the entire team of Bungie and just a whole bunch of other swag from Halo 3, including the limited edition controllers, the Tom McFarlane figurines, faceplates, wall graphics, just everything.
3933596	3934397	Good job, Bungie.
3935437	3937018	I thought that was really cool of them, too.
3937859	3938679	They didn't have to.
3938719	3939840	It wasn't their fault, but
3940450	3941211	They made good on it.
3942392	3943513	Achievement unlocked.
3943794	3944955	Ass successfully kissed.
3957762	3966707	One thing that is probably inevitable, it's going to happen at some point, is that Microsoft's going to want to upgrade those hard drives that are custom to come with the three.
3966727	3968268	I'm sorry, is the show boring you, DarkSakura?
3968348	3968528	No.
3968829	3970149	She just let out a big old yawn.
3970189	3971370	I don't know if the mic picked that up.
3971970	3973831	No, it was, I needed oxygen.
3975352	3975612	All right.
3976013	3976453	No, that's all right.
3977635	3985338	Anyhow, apparently Microsoft is going to be getting rid of the 20GB hard drive that currently comes with the core system, but no worries, it's actually something better that's going to happen.
3985358	3987419	They're going to get a 60GB system.
3987739	3991481	So the core system is going away, and instead you're going to get a pro system.
3992281	3999564	So, that's coming from a site named Trusted Reviews, and they seem pretty sure about this new world exclusive they've got.
4000044	4004766	And, you know, usually we don't trust no-name sites, but then again, what are we, right?
4005846	4007568	Um, you know, here's my thought on it.
4007788	4008488	It makes sense.
4009129	4010090	I guess it makes sense.
4010230	4013873	I mean, I don't think they're gonna, um, get rid of the core system.
4014033	4016795	I mean, because they still have the... I'm sorry, I meant premium, not core.
4016815	4017615	What the hell was I thinking?
4017655	4018216	Thank you, chat.
4019177	4028064	Um, the premium system, what they may do, because, you know, the cost of storage is obviously coming down, is they may just start replacing the, you know, 20s with 60s.
4028204	4031887	So, eventually, you know, they won't be selling the 20 gig hard drive anymore.
4031907	4034849	It'll just come with a 60 gig hard drive, probably for the same price.
4036795	4039456	Or hey, maybe they'll include a price drop in that at the same time.
4039616	4040456	Wouldn't that be awesome?
4041096	4041596	But I doubt it.
4043657	4050358	Well, this would make a lot of sense, though, that this is just a matter of time before this comes out, so we shall see.
4052139	4062501	Well, as far as other things to see, and this makes me happy, there is going to be, finally, a Doctor Who game coming out for...
4063607	4066348	The DS, PS2, and PC.
4066488	4068289	And that makes me very, very, very happy.
4069170	4073492	And I'm assuming that you'd probably play as the 10th Doctor.
4073892	4076934	I mean, I would just assume, although it would be kind of cool if you get your choice, you know.
4077894	4081436	Or if you, like, play as a Dalek and exterminate everything in your path.
4083377	4084537	I think that that would be awesome.
4084778	4090761	And, you know, there were Doctor Who games, like, you know, back in, you know, the early 80s, I think.
4091281	4091521	But
4092051	4093371	This just makes me happy.
4095172	4098333	It would be kind of cool, though, if you could play as a Cyberman and upgrade everybody.
4099073	4101253	Any details about what exactly the game's going to tell?
4101273	4104934	Because I seem to remember we had this announcement on the show before, but it was like a rumor.
4105534	4112116	So I'm just kind of curious, did we get any bonus information, or is this just people wanting us to remember that it is coming soon?
4112296	4116937	Eidos is bringing it out, and the quote is not too far away as far as a release date.
4117657	4119638	So it gets the soon category.
4121337	4122697	So it will be coming soon.
4123017	4124898	I would say probably later than soon.
4125878	4127438	Well, congratulations, DarkSakura.
4127458	4130459	You have successfully worked a Doctor Who reference into our program.
4130839	4131259	Woohoo!
4132039	4132459	There you go.
4133639	4135360	I told you I'd find the noise at some point.
4136080	4136640	Good job.
4137180	4137600	Good job.
4137820	4139961	He's keeping track of our achievement points, chat room.
4140901	4146222	Now, Loki, if you can successfully read the next story with no boo-boos, 30 gamerscore.
4150823	4150903	Uh...
4152552	4160354	So Sega made an announcement basically this week saying that they're not interested in a buyout from EA.
4161655	4171377	So basically they had an interview with Reuters and the Sega Sammy CEO Simon Jeffrey said his company is eager to ride the industry's recent wave of consolidation.
4172597	4174578	That's not an area we want to play in right now.
4174618	4176718	He said we have no interest in being acquired.
4176778	4178819	We are very happy with our position right now.
4181283	4184105	Um, my thought on this is, who asked you?
4184425	4199052	I mean, no one's trying to buy Sega right now, so Well, Loki, tell us what you really think Well, we don't want to be bought out right now That's okay, we don't want to buy you right now either, so That's exactly what Ross Steel UT in chat says Who the hell wants to buy Sega, Sammy?
4201993	4203034	That's kind of sad
4203712	4208176	I know, I know, but, you know, it's just kind of like, you know, well, we don't want to be bought out.
4208296	4212179	See, it's not like, you know, it's not like they're not getting offered to be bought out.
4212279	4215281	It's just like, well, even if we were offered, we'd say no, so.
4215641	4219144	And Ranma in chat says, leave Sega alone!
4222167	4224468	They don't have to make games for you!
4224488	4232615	I mean, if they did buy Sega, you would get the rights to the official...
4233829	4234950	Beijing 2008 Olympics Game
4253924	4257447	Well, you know, EA and Sega could team up, you know, possibly on The Sims 3.
4258428	4262431	Because The Sims 3, you know, has been actually announced that it is coming.
4262991	4264733	And here's the thing about The Sims 3.
4265073	4265834	Here's the big twist.
4265874	4268456	In The Sims 3, you will be going outside.
4270237	4272499	Now, not in real life, unfortunately.
4273701	4274482	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4303461	4305124	Sleep and Poop and all that stuff.
4305184	4311557	So, speaking of which, there will be no more P-Meter in The Sims.
4311597	4313421	They are getting rid of that in The Sims 3.
4314404	4340514	here's a quote from the latest issue of Games for Windows magazine quote the biggest change to The Sims 3 is that it takes place in a wide open constantly changing neighborhood a much bigger sandbox if you will and a much more complex situation the town and park you see on the cover image to the right exists in the same seamless space as your Sims household and what you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within so you can't let yourself in front of people unfortunately no
4341687	4344507	Dude, the best thing was to send somebody on a date and ignore their pee meter.
4347848	4352589	I think the best thing was my old roommate, Billy, did the best house ever.
4352629	4353389	It was hilarious.
4353789	4360370	He had seven gay guys all in a house, and he had them all making out with each other or whatever, and then there was one woman that lived there.
4360770	4370072	Well, somewhere along the line, he forgot to build a bathroom, so the poor woman just had to clean up all the guys' messes, and eventually she died of fatigue.
4370112	4370992	It was really sad.
4371949	4385654	but she could never go to bed because she always had to... Julie made the Death House which had like a swimming pool with no ladder and had flammable objects and she wouldn't teach them how to cook but she'd make them cook.
4386254	4390255	The thing is they won't jump into the pool unless you put a ladder in.
4390295	4391076	Well, you take it out.
4391096	4394817	Yeah, you take it out once they're in the pool and then they don't know how to get out of the pool without a ladder.
4395597	4396137	I love it.
4396858	4400759	It's like, you know, ordinary people can climb out of a pool without a ladder.
4401488	4403869	I know the Sims can't do it.
4404369	4410852	And then you'd make like cells, you know, where you put them in the room and then you lock, and then you remove the door so that they're just trapped in the room.
4411032	4415074	You trap them in the wall and you put a table with a radio on it, full blast.
4415554	4417755	And she had like a full graveyard in the backyard.
4417815	4419736	You know, I'm thinking we have issues.
4420377	4422057	Like, seriously, issues.
4422838	4429040	I like snatching people off the street in debug mode and throwing them into my house and they're never to be seen ever again.
4429961	4430101	Shh.
4432483	4433884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week
4456298	4457059	I have a game.
4457119	4460481	Please say you've picked something relatively sane for the listeners tonight.
4460681	4461441	Hell no!
4462262	4464303	I've picked something intensely insane.
4465904	4470227	I have VidRibbon as our game of the week, which is quite insane.
4470527	4476351	Now, this would have nothing to do with the fact that you have kind of like brought up this game and referenced it on previous shows.
4477391	4478552	I just wanted to pick it.
4479472	4479693	Oh, okay.
4479733	4480533	Well, you can do whatever you want.
4480553	4483375	But we need to play the intro for everybody so they know how to play it.
4496242	4498943	The game sings to you to tell you how to play it.
4499704	4505986	The whole tutorial is sung to you by the stupid little rabbit, and the game's all vector, which I think is pretty freaking fantastic.
4506006	4512709	Well, not like true vector, but it's like a simple line, and a line-drawing bunny that you play as.
4513545	4522749	And the game was developed by Matsura Masaya, who was the guy who brought us Parappa and Jermalani.
4524450	4531794	Basically, Vibri, who is the main character, if you do badly, well, let me start off how to play it.
4532034	4533634	First of all, you've got obstacles that are in the way.
4533674	4536976	You have a block or a loop.
4537631	4539272	or a wave or a pit.
4540192	4546474	And you have to press a different button to bypass this as you're going along on basically this continuous line.
4549055	4559739	And the way that it goes is, you know, if you don't go over the obstacles by pressing the right button, you will get hurt.
4559859	4566182	And the more you get hurt, you change forms and you can turn from a rabbit into a frog and then a worm and then you just die.
4566733	4570096	However, if you do really well, you eventually turn into a fairy princess.
4573798	4575299	Loki, this sounds like your kind of game.
4575319	4576600	You could be a fairy princess.
4577021	4577981	Oh yeah, totally.
4578682	4579302	Right now.
4580003	4591111	But the other things about this is that there are six, I believe, no, there's a few songs that are, yeah, six songs that are included.
4592000	4595127	in the game itself.
4595167	4600959	However, you can put in your own CDs and play whatever you want to, which we tried to do to like a whole bunch of old...
4601832	4604193	Beatmania stuff, but I found the best thing ever.
4636363	4638164	That's right, it's Bib Ribbon's Dragon Force.
4640326	4642447	And Dragon Force, of course, makes any game epic.
4642808	4652415	Well, a little bit more as you go into this game, just a few more details, is that some of your other obstacles are combinations of your basic core obstacles.
4652935	4657879	So you have to press the combination of the two buttons that would have been for the individual obstacle, which is where I was getting hung up.
4658419	4662302	And then you have different levels of gameplay where you'll have your...
4663547	4673415	Obstacles coming at you, but then as you go through harder levels, they'll cross over each other, so you really don't know.
4673756	4675997	You know it's coming up, but you don't know that that's the next one.
4676017	4678840	So the obstacles are coming towards you at different speeds.
4679680	4688187	And you can also play it straightforward, as in you're just staring at it across the screen, but as you play harder levels, you're playing at it from different angles.
4688888	4691390	So it's quite a bit harder.
4691410	4691450	Um...
4693263	4697164	And like I said, the guy that brought this out, Gaze, that's Krapa and M. General Lamy.
4697744	4699284	But there's also sequels.
4699304	4704065	There's Mojibribin, which I think I'm actually still going to pick up.
4704265	4711267	But Mojibribin, you basically are... It's almost like you're rapping, but you're playing kanji.
4711587	4712567	I played it once.
4712767	4713987	It is fascinating.
4714047	4715588	It's so different than Vibribin.
4715628	4716788	There's a third Vibribin, too.
4716848	4717888	There's Vibripple.
4718188	4719088	Yeah.
4719168	4720669	That came out as well.
4721189	4722229	Vibripple is...
4724790	4729211	supposed to be done with different images that are loaded into the game that you play with.
4729871	4740134	Also, there is talk of making a remake of the ribbon for PS3 that will be out via the PlayStation Network.
4740414	4740914	Yes, please.
4742615	4749136	And the closest thing we're discussing the possibility of making a downloadable version of the ribbon for Sony, but I don't know yet.
4750077	4751017	So that'll be really cool.
4751829	4757651	And actually, this game came out in Japan and came out in Europe, but we never got it in America.
4759092	4762433	And it was so weird to see the intro in English when I looked at this YouTube.
4762533	4766015	I was like, oh yeah, that's right, they got this game in Europe, because I've only ever played the Japanese one that you had.
4766055	4771797	That's why I linked it to you so that you could see, because it has this, and it's not an exact translation, but I love the little, I love Vibri.
4771817	4772757	Close enough, close enough.
4772837	4774018	I love Vibri, okay?
4774038	4774898	Vibri is great.
4776499	4777059	Excellent stuff.
4778483	4781706	Oh, and also when you get the high score in this game, he sings a little song to you.
4783348	4785970	There should be a link up there of the song he sings when you get a high score.
4785990	4790675	He does this little dance and says, Yay, you got a high score, let me serenade you.
4792837	4793738	This game is great.
4793758	4795420	Look, he's a fairy princess now.
4795897	4800221	A lovely dose of insanity courtesy of DarkSakura from the ever so cracked out.
4800261	4800982	You've got to check it.
4801042	4801963	Search this on YouTube.
4801983	4802503	Look at the videos.
4802564	4803004	It's awesome.
4803424	4804285	Vib Ribbon.
4804305	4807268	That's V-I-B Ribbon is the name of the game.
4807708	4808309	Check that out.
4809030	4811892	It's this week's classic game of the week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4811932	4812933	Good pick, DarkSakura.
4813914	4815035	Predictable, but good.
4815055	4816497	I approve.
4816537	4817538	It was a matter of time.
4818198	4819420	I knew it was just a matter of time.
4820222	4827306	All right, well, that's going to do it here for Orange Lounge Radio Part A, but we will be back in a little while with more of Orange Lounge Radio on Part B of our podcast.
4827326	4830087	Yes, we are hoping we will have a Part B this week.
4830167	4831888	Everything is arranged so that should happen.
4831968	4833469	So stay tuned.
4833509	4835890	Part B will be coming at you in just a few days.
4836691	4837571	So we'll see you then.
