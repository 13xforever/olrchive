Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Mojo.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, March 30th, 2008, gamerscore hackers get the Smackdown from Microsoft,

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Rock Band is announced for the Wii, and is another PSP redesign on the way.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only, DarkSakura.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Jamie Summers.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Roar.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
How are you doing? Ah, I'm scared.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Roar.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Are things going good for you?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Fairly decently.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Ah, alright. That's good to hear.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Hello.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm fine.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Alright, glad to hear it.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Cool, cool.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, let's start off tonight's show, which is not our last show on lifethusts5.com.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I did a boo-boo in the math last week.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
I don't know how I did this, but you know, we got the announcement about, you know,

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
how to make decisions about what the hell is going to happen with the show, the station going offline.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Not the show, but the station going offline in a couple of weeks.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Somehow, I did the math wrong when I looked at the calendar.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I thought tonight was the last show on lifethusts5, but it's actually next Saturday.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Or next...

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Apparently, I still can't read a calendar.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
It's next Sunday is going to be the last show on lifethusts5.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I somehow missed that there was one more week in March.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
So, whatever.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
So, here we are on March 30th.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
April 6th will be the last show on lifethusts5.com.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
And then April 13th, something else, which we'll get to in a little bit.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
The future of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
We'll talk about that in a little bit, but I wouldn't want to get away from how we usually start things off with.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
How was your gaming week?

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
It was very Ragnarok-ing, as usual.

02:08.000 --> 02:17.000
And then I turned on my DS to play some Final Fantasy VI and then turned it off promptly because I ran out of time.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
And that was pretty much it.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh, yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
And we were going to be able to get another pinball machine, but that fell through.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Which pinball machine?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Attack from Mars.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Oh, I like that one.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
One of the pinball 2000 ones.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, that's one with the holograms in it. I love that one.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
But we were sort of dicked around on it, so it fell through.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
We played one of those at, like, Huzar one time.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
We put rubber bands on the side so that the ball can't fall down.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh, lots of fun.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
Well, we were somehow going to get it for $1500 because the guy was selling that and Adam's family and two other machines.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
And then the people who were going to go in with Dan and Will to buy it ended up not doing it.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
So it was like, oh, yeah, one of the other machines was, like, Fish Tales, which I've never heard of.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
And I was like, who owns a fishing pinball machine?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
So, yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
So it was almost eventful in the realm of pinball.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
But, you know, obviously anybody who's been listening to this show for any significant amount of time knows that you have a love obsession with pinball.

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
Besides Big Bang Bar, the Uber Rare table, what pinball table would you like to own more than anything?

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
I actually have a pan list of a couple.

03:38.000 --> 03:47.000
One of them would actually be Black Knight 2000 because we have actually a Black Knight right now that we're borrowing.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Oh, God, I know what this is called.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
It's one that's like an airplane theme, like a jet theme.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
They had it at Pin-A-Go-Go and it was, the whole game was, like, nothing but ramps, pretty much.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Cool. Fun.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I'll have to find the name of it.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
How about an old school original pinbot? That's what I want more than anything.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
The Bride of Pinbot.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
The Bride of Pinbot's pretty rad, but I want old school original pinbot.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
The one I'm thinking of, though, is Theater of Magic.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Theater of Magic, maybe Addams Family, but Theater of Magic would definitely be on the top of my list.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I mean, I have the machine I want most.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I have World Cup Soccer 94.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
That is the machine to me. I have the one I want.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And the husband's not allowed to sell that ever.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Ever.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
And I have the other one that I really like, which is Twilight Zone.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh, cool.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
So, those two were up there for my two favorite tables.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
You know Dr. Who's pinball?

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
We actually are working on Still Trying to Get Me a Dr. Who.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Very cool.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
I almost bought the TARDIS out of a Dr. Who on eBay, and then I was like, but it's not...

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
I remember, like, working, like I said, working in Qzart and it had that yelling in the background

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
because there's just being a little demo loop with EXTERMINATE!

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
It's like, okay, enough of that.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
A Tommy machine wouldn't be bad.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Tommy, can you hear me?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
It has the giant pinball on top.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I like the Jurassic Park pinball.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
That's when I was like, because the big dinosaur came down and ate your ball.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
But my favorite table ever was Addams Family game.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
I love that one.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
We have a Simpsons pinball party.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
That machine's a bitch.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Why is that?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
It's hard.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Oh my god, is that the one I...

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
And Dan got rid of my Rocky and Bullwinkle, which I really liked.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Aww.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
But Stern is bringing out a new Indiana Jones table.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I don't know if I mentioned that.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
So that's pretty cool.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah, I think last week.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
So that's cool.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
That's pretty cool.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
All right.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Sorry.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
The market's still there.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
There definitely is still a market for pinball.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
It's fun, and there's still rabid fans for that.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
But we're getting off base.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Do you play for Klonoa 2?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
What's that?

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Someone in chat's playing Klonoa 2, and that game's fucking awesome and very depressing.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
You know what would bring pinball back is if they made a way to make it competitive

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
against, you know, a couple tables.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
They've had...

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
I've actually had sort of like a cocktail machine that had two sides on it.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
At Classic Gaming Expo, and I think I've seen it there, and at Pinagogo, they have the versus

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
tables.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
But those are...

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
They're not very fun.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
If you want to join our chat room so Jamie can have random outbursts at the games you're

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
playing this week, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go do it.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
Meanwhile, Loki, I'm thinking you're going to bring us back to console games with your

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
gaming week.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Yes.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
This week I played Crisis Core, so that was pretty cool.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
It's definitely a lot different than, say, your typical Final Fantasy RPG.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I'm not sure if it's too similar to 12.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
The combat system's sort of real time, I guess.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
You run around and you kind of mash buttons, but it's okay.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
It's very linear so far, but like I said, I'm not that far in the game.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
But if it continues the way it is, it's a very linear game.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
But it's fun so far.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I love the cutscenes, though.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
The cutscenes are pretty awesome.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Then I've also played Saints Row, actually the single player, because I'm trying to finish

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
it before Grand Theft Auto IV comes out.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Almost done with the game, though.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm on the last third.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
And then I played just some weird stuff that we'll be probably getting into later, like

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
that Romjek Fail and Tetroid 2012.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
That game's weird.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
It's like Tetris and Silent Hill with Arkanoid.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
I have to see this, because when Loki says, it's Tetris meets Silent Hill, I'm like, what

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
the hell is that supposed to mean?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
It's weird, though.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
All right.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
You've got to check it out.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
All right.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I will.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
That's pretty much it.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
I think I may have played a little bit of Brawl in there, too, at some point.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
The cool thing, though, because mainly this entire week I've been busy trying to get that

07:59.000 --> 08:07.000
stupid 360 working, the second one that went down, and finally fixed it, actually.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Basically at a certain point.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
It's always when I just say, okay, fuck it.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
It's not going to work ever again.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I'm just going to go all out.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
What I did was I took the heat gun and really concentrated it on the GPU chip or whatever,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
and I got a different error code.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
I found out that the error code means that the RAM has a bad solder joint, and there's

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
a way to fix that.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
You just put a couple washers on there, and you're supposed to superglue them or adhere

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
them to it.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
I did that, and then tightened it up, and sure enough, it worked just fine.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
Now we have one more to go, but this one, that was a lot easier, because I bought a

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
replacement warranty sticker, so I'm going to slap that on there and put the old case

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
back on there and send it to Microsoft.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I pray it works.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
This one didn't work at all.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
So far, three out of six have broken, but I fixed two out of the three, so that's not

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
bad so far.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Nice.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Is there anything else to report?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Nothing else?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
That's pretty much it.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
Hopefully we'll have some cool stuff to show Justin.tv later, but right now, that's about

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
it.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.680
Speaking of Justin.tv, we do have a webcam feed of our show.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
It's kind of crap tonight.

09:18.680 --> 09:23.800
I don't know, the Wi-Fi is kind of in and out tonight, so it's been cutting in and out,

09:23.800 --> 09:27.680
but if you want to check it out, www.Justin.tv slash Orange Launch Radio is where our cam

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
is at.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.520
Meanwhile, my gaming week, I kind of had a retro week.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.520
I don't know what it is.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.440
I fired up Xbox Live one day, and I was just like, I'm going to go through and play all

09:36.440 --> 09:38.240
these old games again.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.760
Sometimes you get in that mood for retro, at least I do.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.440
I get in those moods where I want to play Root Beer Tapper today.

09:44.440 --> 09:48.680
Yeah, I've played the game a million times, but it's still one of my favorites from way

09:48.680 --> 09:49.680
back yonder.

09:49.680 --> 09:55.280
So I was playing Root Beer Tapper, Tempest, and some of the other things on Xbox Live

09:55.280 --> 10:04.280
that are not like scream up and down and shout and type wonderful games, but they are classics.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.480
Some of them, I don't even like the upgraded versions, and some of them, I don't think

10:07.480 --> 10:10.280
I like the upgraded version of Tempest nearly as much as the original.

10:10.280 --> 10:14.360
I don't know if it's just like, I can't see as much of what's going on or what have you,

10:14.360 --> 10:15.360
but whatever.

10:15.360 --> 10:22.720
I got some old achievements that for some reason I never got, so it was kind of fun.

10:22.720 --> 10:28.900
Also checked out that new release, T-Quall, whatever that new puzzle game is on Xbox Live

10:28.900 --> 10:31.280
this week, which is okay.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.280
It's kind of like Tetris meets Luminous, sort of.

10:34.280 --> 10:38.440
You have to make the little blocks that you do in Luminous, but you make them with Tetris

10:38.440 --> 10:40.440
shaped pieces in different colors.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.580
And it's not just two colors, it's like four different colors.

10:43.580 --> 10:45.480
It's kind of different.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.600
There's a lot of different power ups.

10:48.600 --> 10:53.940
It's interesting though because the presentation of the game, the whole fact that it's kind

10:53.940 --> 10:59.280
of like that tribal jungle Amazon type thing really reminds me of Zuma.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.280
Yeah, I was going to say that.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.560
No other game has.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.700
It seems like some of the sound effects are ripped right out of Zuma, but yet I don't

11:06.700 --> 11:08.360
believe this game is a PopCap game.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.000
I believe it's made by somebody else.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.320
Now the game itself has nothing to do with Zuma.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.880
I mean, the games themselves are completely separate except for the fact that they're

11:14.880 --> 11:16.660
both puzzle-ish games.

11:16.660 --> 11:20.700
They have that other one too that's just like kind of Zuma or the same tribal thing.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.840
It was, not Crystal Quest.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
It was...

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
Oh, Magnetica.

11:25.840 --> 11:32.200
No, no, no, no, not like Zuma, I'm talking about the tribal thing, it's an Xbox Live

11:32.200 --> 11:33.200
Arcade game.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.200
Oh, Jewel Quest.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.980
Jewel Quest, yeah.

11:37.980 --> 11:42.760
And Jewel Quest is like bejeweled with one little twist to it.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.840
It's interesting.

11:43.840 --> 11:47.880
But I didn't end up really buying the full version of it because the demo gives you really

11:47.880 --> 11:52.860
good taste of the game and I just, I don't know, I can't keep justifying these little

11:52.860 --> 11:57.480
five and ten dollar purchases for games I'm not going to play more than a couple times.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.460
So that's that.

11:59.460 --> 12:04.680
Some days I do wish Xbox Live would switch to that model of you just pay a point, there's

12:04.680 --> 12:07.480
so many points, just play the game a couple times, you know what I mean?

12:07.480 --> 12:08.480
Like a rental?

12:08.480 --> 12:10.580
Like a regular arcade or a rental, I don't know.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.080
But that'll never happen.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.080
So.

12:13.080 --> 12:18.440
Gerardimo in chat says, Tikal, or Tikal, how in the hell are you supposed to pronounce

12:18.440 --> 12:19.440
that even?

12:19.440 --> 12:20.440
Tikal?

12:20.440 --> 12:21.440
I would guess it would be Tikal.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.440
Tikal?

12:22.440 --> 12:26.320
I think it would be Tikal because the U would not give, there's no U there.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.320
Yeah, all right, Tikal.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.760
It means like T-qual, like Tiki or Tikal.

12:30.760 --> 12:31.760
I like Tikal.

12:31.760 --> 12:36.680
Gerardimo says Tikal, a mashup of good puzzle games, why did you expect it to be decent?

12:36.680 --> 12:38.040
Because I like puzzle games.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.400
And I would say it's decent, it just didn't, like it didn't wow me.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.720
Like the first time I played Luminous I was like, this game is the shit, I love this game.

12:44.720 --> 12:49.680
It didn't wow me, but it wasn't horrible either.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.200
The other thing I did during my gaming week, you know I'm like, I think I mentioned this

12:53.200 --> 12:57.040
a couple weeks ago on the show, I've been really late to the Steam bandwagon, you know,

12:57.040 --> 13:02.960
on the PC, getting Steam and checking that out, which is kind of like XFire meets Xbox

13:02.960 --> 13:07.640
Live meets an online type store kind of thing on your PC.

13:07.640 --> 13:11.440
I downloaded that a couple weeks ago and I finally bought a game this week.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.840
And the game I bought was Portal, because Loki finally took his copy of the Orange Box

13:15.840 --> 13:20.400
backs a little while ago, and I was very sad I couldn't play that on Xbox 360 anymore.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.280
But the only game in there I was like really, really missing and wanting to play again was

13:24.280 --> 13:25.280
Portal.

13:25.280 --> 13:30.960
And I'll tell you what, big difference, and I know this is like a classic debate, but

13:30.960 --> 13:34.960
it's not something I often think about because I do most of my gaming on console and, you

13:34.960 --> 13:39.080
know, World of Warcraft on the PC and a couple other things here and there, I don't have

13:39.080 --> 13:44.280
to think about this, but there really is a world of difference between keyboard and mouse

13:44.280 --> 13:45.920
and two analog sticks.

13:45.920 --> 13:50.920
Like, I think I actually do a lot better with the keyboard and mouse than I do analog sticks,

13:50.920 --> 13:51.920
you know?

13:51.920 --> 13:55.720
And, you know, I know it's a classic debate, people say this is better, this is better.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.800
I might actually be a little better at Halo if I could use a keyboard and mouse in it.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.960
And yes, I know I could get Halo 2 and Vista, but I don't have Vista, so.

14:01.960 --> 14:07.240
Well, you can also get one of the, they have the T-mix, the cuter stuff that you can buy

14:07.240 --> 14:10.800
that, you know, can hook up a keyboard and mouse and do it that way.

14:10.800 --> 14:16.040
I do like how you actually fire the portal gun with a PC, your left or right click.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.040
Yeah.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.640
I see, I think that that's a little bit more intuitive.

14:18.640 --> 14:25.440
Yeah, I don't know, I just, I like, I kind of like the feel of it on the PC a little

14:25.440 --> 14:27.760
better than I did on the Xbox 360.

14:27.760 --> 14:32.080
You know, the Xbox 360, I could still play that on my big screen TV and it was loud and

14:32.080 --> 14:36.320
it was nice, you know, and this one, whereas I have a wide screen monitor out here, it's

14:36.320 --> 14:40.300
not very big, but it's still pretty, so, you know, same game.

14:40.300 --> 14:43.200
You know we love Portal here at Orange Launch Radio, I don't have a lot else to say about

14:43.200 --> 14:47.040
the game, but just kind of making that transition was very interesting, because it's the exact

14:47.040 --> 14:51.160
same game, just playing it two different ways, and I think I actually do a lot better with

14:51.160 --> 14:55.140
the mouse, and I think part of what Jamie said has a lot to do with that, just the way

14:55.140 --> 14:59.920
you control the firing and just the movement is different and all that, so.

14:59.920 --> 15:06.040
It took me a minute to get used to moving, though, because sometimes with the whole WASD,

15:06.040 --> 15:09.680
like I think if you hit two of them at the same time, it gets confused, like, you know,

15:09.680 --> 15:14.160
it's a little unlike World of Warcraft, which also does WASD, but anyway.

15:14.160 --> 15:18.960
One thing I will say about the difference on there, too, just for perspective, I get

15:18.960 --> 15:22.360
more motion sick watching it on a TV.

15:22.360 --> 15:27.300
Is it because it's just bigger, and so more of your vision is taken up by the images?

15:27.300 --> 15:34.600
That could possibly be it, but I was watching on a wide screen laptop before.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.560
RossdielUT in chat says, Street Fighter would be an atrocity on a keyboard and mouse.

15:38.560 --> 15:44.680
Yeah, I remember an old, actually, I had Street Fighter II Turbo, Super Duper, whatever it

15:44.680 --> 15:49.560
was, the last big one they did, they had a computer version of it on CD that had Redbook

15:49.560 --> 15:54.480
audio for the different stages, like redone music, and so yeah, I had that on the PC,

15:54.480 --> 15:59.100
and I played it on the keyboard, and it's just not the same, it's just not the same.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.360
And then I go way, way back, and I think about Stick Fighter.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.360
Stick Fighter is fucking awesome.

16:03.360 --> 16:08.680
If you've ever played Stick Fighter, remember that game back in the day?

16:08.680 --> 16:11.560
If you've never played Stick Fighter, it's gotta be out there on the internet somewhere.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.720
It was one of those, like, back in the shareware days.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.960
You probably have to get a slowdown program to make it work okay, I imagine it's like,

16:17.960 --> 16:23.000
way, but Stick Fighter was a Street Fighter II clone, but it used nothing but stick figures,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.360
but they actually stole voice samples out of the game and some of the later versions,

16:26.360 --> 16:27.360
it was great.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.360
That was great.

16:29.360 --> 16:35.160
All right, let's get into tonight's housekeeping, since we're done with our gaming weeks, we'll

16:35.160 --> 16:38.440
get into housekeeping tonight, and I know the question on everybody's mind is, okay,

16:38.440 --> 16:41.920
we dropped that bombshell last week, that Orange Lounge Radio is going to be closing

16:41.920 --> 16:47.840
its doors as a live 24 hour a day, seven day a week station as of April 12th.

16:47.840 --> 16:54.360
I'm sorry, April, yeah, no, April 12th is our last broadcast day.

16:54.360 --> 16:58.020
So you know, there's been a lot of question, and this all came up very last minute for

16:58.020 --> 16:59.020
us last week.

16:59.020 --> 17:03.200
Apparently, we found out about it like 45 minutes before we went live.

17:03.200 --> 17:08.360
So we really had to kind of scramble to figure out what we were going to do.

17:08.360 --> 17:14.680
I want to kind of thank everybody that sent us emails this week and sent us private messages

17:14.680 --> 17:20.960
and all of that sort and posts on forums and things with suggestions for us.

17:20.960 --> 17:24.400
I think I got told to check out about 10 different websites.

17:24.400 --> 17:29.600
A couple people actually offered to host a streaming thing for us.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.280
I wasn't able to do a lot of research on that, but I think that's very cool that people would

17:33.280 --> 17:35.420
do that.

17:35.420 --> 17:38.240
But ultimately, we decided to take things in a different direction, and it was kind

17:38.240 --> 17:42.660
of the first thing that came, it was the first idea that we had here at Orange Lounge Radio

17:42.660 --> 17:45.020
to do with the future of the show.

17:45.020 --> 17:51.680
And first, let me say this as well, chat, it's not April Fool's, okay?

17:51.680 --> 17:53.320
It just so happens live 365.

17:53.320 --> 17:56.920
You know, if you've listened to this show long enough, you know we freaking hate April

17:56.920 --> 17:57.920
Fool's Day, okay?

17:57.920 --> 18:01.080
So the last thing we would do is do something crappy like that for April Fool's Day.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.940
This is not an April Fool's joke, okay?

18:03.940 --> 18:06.960
So now I lost my train of thought.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.960
Damn you, chat.

18:07.960 --> 18:08.960
What was I saying?

18:08.960 --> 18:09.960
Oh, yes.

18:09.960 --> 18:14.760
So the first idea that came to our minds is the one we decided to go with.

18:14.760 --> 18:20.900
So we emailed some people and did some talking, and it looks like everybody's on board.

18:20.900 --> 18:25.840
So this is what's going to happen, folks, starting April 13th, that's episode number

18:25.840 --> 18:33.200
275 of our show, we will now be officially a part of AllGames.com.

18:33.200 --> 18:39.240
We are going to merge, essentially, some of our shows from our station with the operations

18:39.240 --> 18:41.800
they have over at AllGames.com.

18:41.800 --> 18:49.160
And in a way, I've been kind of joking all week long, it's creating a Voltron of independent

18:49.160 --> 18:54.080
podcasting, and that's kind of what I really believe in what's going to happen.

18:54.080 --> 18:58.920
Because while we could have set up our own feed and taken one of these offers to set

18:58.920 --> 19:03.800
up our own thing and run our own music feed and live thing, music and all that stuff takes

19:03.800 --> 19:05.240
a long time to set up.

19:05.240 --> 19:10.520
It's more than just putting MP3s at random, trust me for this.

19:10.520 --> 19:18.340
So it's kind of like, why would we want to do that and run this whole separate thing

19:18.340 --> 19:23.200
when there's this perfectly established station going on over there that we already have a

19:23.200 --> 19:26.360
good relationship with because our show's been syndicated over on the network.

19:26.360 --> 19:30.880
We know the people there, we like the people over there, we're kind of something different-ish

19:30.880 --> 19:34.380
on the network, it's a type of show they don't have otherwise.

19:34.380 --> 19:41.900
Why go run off and do our own thing when we can instead come together and form a bigger

19:41.900 --> 19:42.920
and better station?

19:42.920 --> 19:44.880
Because look at all the experience that's going to be going into this.

19:44.880 --> 19:50.800
You've got All Games, they've been up for what, 10, 11 years, like a shitload long time.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.320
We've been running for five and a half years.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.600
You take all that experience and bring it together, that's going to be awesome.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.440
And here, let me tell you guys the perks as far as live listener goes.

19:58.440 --> 20:03.320
This means no more registering to sign up to listen up, no more listener caps.

20:03.320 --> 20:06.920
I think there is a listener cap on All Games, but it's like 1,000 or some ungodly number

20:06.920 --> 20:09.760
will never hit.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.600
There's the fact that you can listen to it on your PSP now.

20:12.600 --> 20:18.760
If you check out allgames.com on your PSP, and I believe it's one of the preset stations

20:18.760 --> 20:23.160
in the PSP as well.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.320
It's going to be a good thing.

20:24.320 --> 20:28.280
The more and more I think about it, the more I think this is the right idea for us.

20:28.280 --> 20:34.560
Here also, I have no announcements at this time as far as our other shows go, speaking

20:34.560 --> 20:42.260
of Travis Donovan and DMN, however, we are in talks to have that be a part of the merge,

20:42.260 --> 20:44.320
and they didn't say no.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.320
Right now, that's all in limbo.

20:45.320 --> 20:49.120
I have nothing further to say at this time, but that is exciting that some of our other

20:49.120 --> 20:54.720
stuff will probably go over there as well if everybody's happy.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.560
Let's put it that way.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.480
I think it'll be good though.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.160
I think it's going to be a great thing.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.160
Anything else you guys want to add?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.160
I got nothing to add.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.160
Nothing to add?

21:03.160 --> 21:04.160
Dark Sakura?

21:04.160 --> 21:05.160
I like pastrami.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.160
You like pastrami?

21:07.160 --> 21:12.720
Yes, none of the content of our show is going to change, and that's the other great thing

21:12.720 --> 21:18.340
about this mergingwithallgames.com is that they know our shtick.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.480
They know what we do.

21:19.480 --> 21:24.160
They don't want us to change anything, so we're not going to.

21:24.160 --> 21:29.180
We might do some aesthetic type changes with this move, like we might take the opportunity

21:29.180 --> 21:33.140
to clean up our album art, maybe do a different audio.

21:33.140 --> 21:36.860
We might make some small aesthetical changes, but as far as the content that you're actually

21:36.860 --> 21:40.120
going to hear in the show, nothing's going to change in that regard.

21:40.120 --> 21:44.120
According to Jamie, there will be more pastrami.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.240
There may be more pastrami.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.440
We'll have to work on that, but nothing's going to change.

21:48.440 --> 21:52.100
As far as podcasts go, if you guys are listening on the podcast only and you've never been

21:52.100 --> 21:57.480
able to join us for the live experience, not a damn thing's going to change for you, really.

21:57.480 --> 22:01.520
We might experiment with some different sound qualities because we're actually going to

22:01.520 --> 22:06.040
be broadcasting a higher quality over on allgames.com than we were here, so we might change some

22:06.040 --> 22:09.400
things in the way we're distributing the podcast, but honestly, you're not going to have to

22:09.400 --> 22:11.600
change your subscription or anything like that.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.880
You're still going to get the podcast.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.560
It's like nothing ever happened for you guys if you've never listened to us live.

22:15.560 --> 22:16.560
It's going to be like nothing ever happened.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.480
I hate to say it, even though the sound may be in higher quality, the show will not.

22:19.480 --> 22:24.520
Yes, the show will not be in higher quality, I'm sorry to say.

22:24.520 --> 22:25.520
There it is.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.520
I don't know.

22:26.520 --> 22:27.760
Is there anything else to add?

22:27.760 --> 22:28.760
Anything else we should say?

22:28.760 --> 22:29.760
I don't think so.

22:29.760 --> 22:30.760
I'm out of soda.

22:30.760 --> 22:31.760
That's not good.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.840
When I say no content change, that also means everything the live folks are used to, like

22:35.840 --> 22:39.340
the little special thing we do after the show that we call the afterbirth, that is actually

22:39.340 --> 22:41.600
not going away, and I was very surprised.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.000
I thought we might have to make some changes to that, but they were very open, and we don't

22:45.000 --> 22:47.040
have to change anything about our afterbirth.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.040
Very excited.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.360
We don't have to change anything.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.320
Oh, well, maybe we'll have to remove the segment of Make Fun of Bobby Black Wolf.

22:55.320 --> 22:58.440
Oh, yeah, we will have to get rid of the Make Fun of Bobby Black Wolf segment, probably,

22:58.440 --> 23:04.760
but that's all right.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.520
I think that's about it.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.300
Nothing else to say, so I guess we're going to move into... I'm wondering if there's

23:10.300 --> 23:11.880
any other questions in chat.

23:11.880 --> 23:12.880
Let's see.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.720
Am I still able to tune in with iTunes and WinApp?

23:14.720 --> 23:17.880
Yes, and you'll be able to do it a whole lot easier, actually, because you don't have to

23:17.880 --> 23:26.720
register for Light

23:26.720 --> 23:35.480
of the Week.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.600
I need it easier than that.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.600
I don't.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.680
Bookmark it.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.960
I don't know what else to tell you.

23:41.960 --> 23:47.040
Zlatan asks, will it be 30 seconds behind Live 365?

23:47.040 --> 23:51.580
I do not think the buffer will be as great, because I think we're having to... Because

23:51.580 --> 23:56.600
right now we send from my computer to Live 365, who encodes it to their server that's

23:56.600 --> 23:59.720
in... I don't think it's going to be as much of a delay.

23:59.720 --> 24:03.960
I think there will still be a delay, but that's inevitable because of the encoding process,

24:03.960 --> 24:06.240
but it won't be like 30 seconds.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.240
It'll be an hour.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.400
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf is in chat helping to clear the air right now.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.400
Thank you, Bobby.

24:11.400 --> 24:15.920
He actually says it still will be 30 seconds, but that's just inevitable, because it's buffer

24:15.920 --> 24:16.920
and all that stuff.

24:16.920 --> 24:20.320
Rasteel UT says, fuck that.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.740
Bring Black Wolf on and make fun of him.

24:21.740 --> 24:22.920
We just might do that, actually.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.680
No, we love Bobby, of course.

24:24.680 --> 24:28.960
Bobby has actually been very instrumental in making this happen, so we love Bobby.

24:28.960 --> 24:35.080
Actually, that's another really good thing, is because when we're live on Sunday nights,

24:35.080 --> 24:39.940
Bobby's show airs at 5 o'clock, and he says that he's going to keep his show to an hour.

24:39.940 --> 24:43.440
Maybe occasionally he'll run over, but very little.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.800
The nice thing is, is that instead of having just kind of like music as a lead in, we're

24:47.800 --> 24:50.440
going to have a really good quality show.

24:50.440 --> 24:54.760
It's almost like being on a real television network, where you have a quality show as

24:54.760 --> 24:56.400
a lead in to your show.

24:56.400 --> 24:59.880
It's going to be great, and I think the listeners are really going to benefit, and we're all

24:59.880 --> 25:03.660
going to benefit, because we'll get some of Bobby's people, he'll get some of our people.

25:03.660 --> 25:06.400
That's all goes into the Voltron of independent podcasting, the future.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.640
It's like when they have heroes on, and then they have Chuck, and then everyone turns the

25:09.640 --> 25:11.320
TV off when Chuck comes on.

25:11.320 --> 25:14.160
Well, I'm hoping it doesn't go like that, but maybe.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.160
Rob.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.160
What?

25:16.160 --> 25:19.000
Will it blend?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.080
It may indeed blend.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.080
We'll see.

25:24.080 --> 25:29.080
We2 in chat says, as usual, OLR is the gamer tech podcast, whatever happened to OLR Food

25:29.080 --> 25:30.080
Network.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.920
OLR Food Network is still here.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.520
Pastrami, Jamie?

25:33.520 --> 25:34.520
Yum.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.520
All right.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.920
With cheese and grilled onions, and no burger.

25:37.920 --> 25:38.920
All right.

25:38.920 --> 25:39.920
I'm so mad.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.760
So this is going to be a good thing, but regardless, we really appreciate those of you guys that

25:43.760 --> 25:47.520
have supported our own live feed over the past five and a half years of our music feed.

25:47.520 --> 25:51.380
I know some of you guys were listening to us at work, but now you have allgames.com

25:51.380 --> 25:52.380
to listen to.

25:52.380 --> 25:53.380
You always did.

25:53.380 --> 25:56.060
They play music during the day.

25:56.060 --> 26:00.640
They play a different mix of video game music than we did, but it's a good mix of music.

26:00.640 --> 26:05.040
It's a little more current mix of music in some regards, and they also have talk radio

26:05.040 --> 26:08.400
that plays throughout the day, which I think is highly entertaining, and you never know

26:08.400 --> 26:09.840
what might happen in the future.

26:09.840 --> 26:10.840
You never know.

26:10.840 --> 26:14.680
This is going to free all of us up to kind of be working towards a more common goal now

26:14.680 --> 26:19.080
and working on kind of the visibility of the same radio station.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.080
It's going to be a good thing.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.080
All right.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.080
I'll shut up.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.080
I'll stop talking about it.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.080
We're beating this topic into the ground.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.640
Let's get into tonight's gaming news.

26:25.640 --> 26:26.640
Loki.

26:26.640 --> 26:32.320
Speaking of beating stuff into the ground, Activision's Guitar Hero Aerosmith has announced

26:32.320 --> 26:38.580
its first few tracks that will be available for, I guess, fans of Aerosmith.

26:38.580 --> 26:46.480
Of course, included in these are Make It, Uncle Salty, Draw the Line, No Surprise, and

26:46.480 --> 26:50.080
Sweet Emotion.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.080
That's kind of neat.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.840
There's going to be, I guess, 40 plus songs in the game.

26:54.840 --> 26:59.760
Sixty percent of it, of course, I guess, will be devoted to Aerosmith.

26:59.760 --> 27:04.560
In fact, actually, I saw the way they kind of have it set up is neat.

27:04.560 --> 27:10.240
You're going to be doing different sets, I guess, follow their career a little bit.

27:10.240 --> 27:14.620
They'll have two songs that are openers that are from a different band, and then they'll

27:14.620 --> 27:17.880
have three Aerosmith songs, maybe a bonus song or something like that, and they're going

27:17.880 --> 27:21.400
to have different sets set up like that.

27:21.400 --> 27:25.240
As long as it's better than Guitar Hero Rocks the 80s, right?

27:25.240 --> 27:27.720
I think it will be.

27:27.720 --> 27:28.720
What do you think?

27:28.720 --> 27:31.980
What do you think is the sellability of a game like this that really focuses on one

27:31.980 --> 27:32.980
band?

27:32.980 --> 27:36.120
I know, yeah, they might have songs from other bands in it, like I heard they're going to

27:36.120 --> 27:44.240
have Lenny Kravitz and people that have worked with Aerosmith, but Aerosmith's name is on

27:44.240 --> 27:45.240
the cover.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.240
It's Steve Tyler's lips.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.800
Yes, and those big old lips are on the cover.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.160
Is that going to be enough, do you think, to sell this game?

27:51.160 --> 27:53.400
Maybe, but here's the thing.

27:53.400 --> 27:57.100
I would just, the easiest way to decide if you want this game or not, just wait until

27:57.100 --> 28:05.960
they get down to the point where they announce the entire soundtrack to the game.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.720
My guess is they're not going to have download content for this game.

28:08.720 --> 28:13.100
It's probably just going to be these songs and that's it, because why would they cut

28:13.100 --> 28:17.020
into their Guitar Hero 3 download content, which of course is still going to be going

28:17.020 --> 28:22.600
on until Guitar Hero 4 comes out.

28:22.600 --> 28:26.880
If it's just something that sounds like you may like, if you're a fan of Aerosmith, great.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.720
It's more power to you.

28:28.720 --> 28:34.040
If you hate Aerosmith, you probably won't buy this game.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.960
I think we can all be in agreement.

28:36.960 --> 28:42.220
A lot of these music games are really starting to melt, get to the point of getting sick

28:42.220 --> 28:43.220
of this.

28:43.220 --> 28:47.400
In fact, we'll be getting to some other stuff later, like Sing Star.

28:47.400 --> 28:51.300
I'm thinking part of the reason that makes this so alluring is that it looks like they're

28:51.300 --> 28:54.220
just using the same damn engine from Guitar Hero 3.

28:54.220 --> 28:55.280
It's updated a little bit.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.520
The engine itself is actually upgraded a bit.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.000
Define a little bit.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.840
The graphics are a little bit better, animations are recaptured and they're a lot smoother.

29:03.840 --> 29:04.840
Stuff like that.

29:04.840 --> 29:08.080
But yeah, it's basically Guitar Hero 3.

29:08.080 --> 29:13.400
Gerardimo in chat, chat.orangewellandshare.com, suggests Guitar Hero ABBA mix.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.400
I'd be down with that.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.760
But do they use any real guitar?

29:16.760 --> 29:21.600
No, but you know, they have an opening for a drummer, so they might be Drum Hero.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.600
No, I have to laugh though.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
You're going to love this.

29:23.600 --> 29:27.760
Well, I have to laugh because on the trailer, you know how they have all the little logos

29:27.760 --> 29:32.920
of the different people that have products in the game and stuff like that, and Gibson

29:32.920 --> 29:33.920
was on there?

29:33.920 --> 29:35.480
I'm like, oh, that's funny.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.480
Oh, the irony.

29:37.480 --> 29:38.480
Ironic.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.400
Very ironic.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.400
It's like Ray-Ain.

29:41.400 --> 29:48.540
Well, we'll hear more about Guitar Hero Aerosmith in the future, I'm sure, as we get closer

29:48.540 --> 29:49.540
to the release date.

29:49.540 --> 29:57.000
Another game we're hearing more and more about is Ninja Gaiden 2, which looks bloody fantastic.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Emphasis on bloody.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
It looks wonderful.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.420
Ninja Gaiden 2, if you want to see all that blood, the demo is going to be coming in May.

30:05.420 --> 30:09.420
May is going to be the delivery of the Ninja Gaiden 2 demo.

30:09.420 --> 30:12.840
That is according to Microsoft's Ninja Gaiden 2 website.

30:12.840 --> 30:17.880
And apparently, there's also supposed to be some exclusive content beginning on April

30:17.880 --> 30:18.880
15th.

30:18.880 --> 30:23.360
But if it's anything like previous exclusive content, it's probably crappy gamer picks

30:23.360 --> 30:27.200
and crappy themes, and maybe some cool-looking trailers.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.960
But I wouldn't expect that there's going to be like, you know, a pre-demo.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.840
I mean, I don't think you can have it.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.680
So I'm pretty sure it's just gamer picks and stuff.

30:35.680 --> 30:39.940
The game, by the way, comes out on June 3rd, and I think there's a lot of folks that are

30:39.940 --> 30:40.940
very excited about it.

30:40.940 --> 30:41.940
Ninja Gaiden Hi-Rez.

30:41.940 --> 30:48.880
I miss, what was her name from Ninja, Irene.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.320
I miss her from the original game.

30:51.320 --> 30:53.760
Remember the CIA agent or whatever she was?

30:53.760 --> 30:56.680
Those cutscenes were so frickin' epic back then in the NES days.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.780
Now you expect cutscenes in your games.

30:58.780 --> 31:00.800
Back then, epic.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.800
Just epic.

31:02.800 --> 31:09.080
Well, one thing that we've talked about on the show before is the Penny Arcade game that's

31:09.080 --> 31:15.600
supposed to be, well, an episodic series, Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice

31:15.600 --> 31:17.600
of Darkness.

31:17.600 --> 31:25.200
There is a price out for it now, $19.95, which would be about half that numeric value in

31:25.200 --> 31:30.880
pounds for our UK listeners, and that's just for the Windows, Mac, and Linux version of

31:30.880 --> 31:31.880
the game.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.000
It's going to be released on Linux, that's cool.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.720
There is an Xbox Live Arcade version that will have a simultaneous launch, no price

31:39.720 --> 31:40.720
released yet.

31:40.720 --> 31:46.360
Five to ten hours of playing for you, so that's pretty cool.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.120
Ninja Gaiden No, it's weird.

31:48.120 --> 31:53.880
I thought that they were saying that the, I want to say that the Xbox Live Arcade version

31:53.880 --> 32:01.780
was going to be $20, which I thought was kind of surprising, seeing as they haven't really

32:01.780 --> 32:03.720
had a game that would spend $20.

32:03.720 --> 32:09.560
I think the most was like Luminous with $15 and stuff, but $20 for that game is really

32:09.560 --> 32:10.560
expensive.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.760
Penny Arcade It is a little steep.

32:12.760 --> 32:16.040
Ninja Gaiden This game better be epic as well, for $20.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.800
Penny Arcade I'm going to pay that much money, I'll just

32:17.800 --> 32:18.800
get it on Windows.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.000
Ninja Gaiden But, yeah, I was going to say, you know, $20

32:22.000 --> 32:26.400
is kind of the average of your $19.95 is what you pay for a low budget Windows game, so

32:26.400 --> 32:28.920
is it really that obscene of a price on Xbox Live?

32:28.920 --> 32:32.460
Not really, you know, but as long as the game is quality, that's what's important.

32:32.460 --> 32:38.100
You know it has a great tie-in, you know, I don't know a lot of gamers who don't love

32:38.100 --> 32:43.020
Penny Arcade, or at least like and respect it a lot, so you know it's going to be at

32:43.020 --> 32:46.840
least the quality there, it's just the question of, but will it be, it's kind of like that

32:46.840 --> 32:48.440
question, will it blend?

32:48.440 --> 32:50.440
Will it blend into a game?

32:50.440 --> 32:51.440
We'll see.

32:51.440 --> 32:54.760
Ninja Gaiden Yeah, now a game that we're probably not

32:54.760 --> 33:01.560
going to get over here, unfortunately, Raiden Fighters Aces has gotten a demo on the Japanese

33:01.560 --> 33:07.560
Xbox Live, of course I think some of us who have Xbox Live accounts in Japan might be

33:07.560 --> 33:10.680
able to download that, I haven't tried it yet though.

33:10.680 --> 33:16.360
Now Raiden Fighters Aces is, I believe, just a collection of the three Raiden Fighters

33:16.360 --> 33:24.400
games, of course Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, Operation Helldive, and Raiden Fighters

33:24.400 --> 33:34.240
Jet, or actually all three of those from the late 90s, and great top-down shooter games.

33:34.240 --> 33:40.240
You know, there was, back in the day on the Playstation, there was just, for the first

33:40.240 --> 33:45.840
two Raiden games, you know before these came out, there was a compilation on there, I would

33:45.840 --> 33:48.560
like to see one that's all of them.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.560
That would be a big compilation.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.520
That would be a very big compilation.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.640
That would be epic.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.120
You know what that compilation's called?

33:57.120 --> 33:58.120
MAME.

33:58.120 --> 34:04.840
Actually, the boards for the first three Raiden games have been intensely difficult for them

34:04.840 --> 34:05.840
to crack.

34:05.840 --> 34:10.480
I think that they've only gotten, they haven't, as far as I know they haven't cracked Raiden

34:10.480 --> 34:11.480
DX yet.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.480
That game was fun, we had that at our round table.

34:14.480 --> 34:19.120
I like the electric one that latches on and does the swirly bit.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.120
That was my favorite one.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.120
Yeah.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.760
Very cool.

34:23.760 --> 34:30.400
Alright, well, talking about games coming from Japan and shooter games, you know, I

34:30.400 --> 34:34.360
guess somebody out there was just thinking to themselves, like, you know, we don't have

34:34.360 --> 34:36.520
enough shoot-em-up games on Xbox Live.

34:36.520 --> 34:37.520
We really don't.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.520
We need more.

34:39.520 --> 34:43.920
And luckily, though, one of the granddaddies of shoot-em-up games is on its way to Xbox

34:43.920 --> 34:44.920
Live Arcade.

34:44.920 --> 34:45.920
It's Ikaruga.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.280
So I guess we can make room for that.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.120
We can find room in there somewhere.

34:50.120 --> 34:54.080
And of course, we've been having rumors about this game for a couple weeks now, and the

34:54.080 --> 34:59.600
latest one, I think last week we had the month nailed down as April, well, this week, thanks

34:59.600 --> 35:06.040
to the Japan's version of Xbox.com, we now know that the release date is set to be April

35:06.040 --> 35:07.040
9th.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.880
Now, of course, all these types of things are always subject to change, and who knows,

35:10.880 --> 35:15.400
the Japanese website could have been wrong, but, you know, it does look pretty likely

35:15.400 --> 35:19.280
it's going to be out in early April rather than later, which isn't a bad thing because

35:19.280 --> 35:20.280
Ikaruga is pretty awesome.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.600
It is pretty awesome.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.240
So I guess we can make room for one more shooter if it's Ikaruga.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.680
You know what?

35:26.680 --> 35:28.320
You know what I would rather see than Ikaruga?

35:28.320 --> 35:29.320
What?

35:29.320 --> 35:30.520
Radiant Silver Gun.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.520
You never know.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.520
I wish.

35:33.520 --> 35:44.560
Well, in other news as far as games to be out, and this is actually more of a leak from

35:44.560 --> 35:53.400
the ESRB, and this would be also for Xbox Live, Darwinia is supposed to be coming out

35:53.400 --> 35:55.400
and it actually was confirmed.

35:55.400 --> 36:01.440
It's actually listed as Darwinia Plus, Survival of the Flat, or, which is, okay, from what

36:01.440 --> 36:08.780
I'm understanding on here, it's a multiplayer version, Multiwinia, Survival of the Flattest,

36:08.780 --> 36:10.160
so it's fairly interesting.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.600
We've had a lot of people tell us about this game that it's supposed to be really good,

36:13.600 --> 36:20.120
but there's actually a demo out for Windows, Mac, and Linux right now.

36:20.120 --> 36:25.200
Quel Tipo in chat says, screw Darwinia, I want Darwin awards the game.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.240
Isn't that just pain on PlayStation Network?

36:28.240 --> 36:29.240
I'm not sure.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.000
That sounds sort of like it.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.040
But no, Darwinia, I've heard nothing but good things about Darwinia, so it's kind of neat

36:35.040 --> 36:40.640
that these little games are getting this more massive distribution, and I'm assuming from

36:40.640 --> 36:44.960
the whole Plus in the name, there's going to be a lot of extra futures, which probably

36:44.960 --> 36:50.200
will be justifying the cost of it on Xbox Live, but I look forward to an easy way to

36:50.200 --> 36:51.200
check it out.

36:51.200 --> 36:58.480
Well, if anyone wants to check out the demo, go to introversion.co.uk slash Darwinia, and

36:58.480 --> 37:01.480
you can download the demo there.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.480
Very cool.

37:02.480 --> 37:07.400
Another game we can look forward to around Christmas this year, of course, for whatever

37:07.400 --> 37:11.880
reason, Microsoft likes to release at least one family game around that time.

37:11.880 --> 37:18.640
This year, instead of, and I can only hope that's instead of, Viva Pinata and Viva Pinata

37:18.640 --> 37:27.520
Party Animals, and probably another Viva Pinata sequel, we get Banjo Kazooie 3, and to be

37:27.520 --> 37:29.920
honest, I had never played the original game.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.840
It's a headache.

37:32.840 --> 37:37.560
No interest from me whatsoever, but hey, I know a lot of people liked it.

37:37.560 --> 37:42.280
I played it once, and I know it has a rabid fan base because of its quirky sense of humor.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.280
Yes.

37:43.280 --> 37:49.860
If you're looking forward to it, I would say you're probably going to see it in November.

37:49.860 --> 37:52.480
How highly anticipated do you think this game is?

37:52.480 --> 37:54.920
One thing I also know about Banjo Kazooie is that it's been a long time since there's

37:54.920 --> 37:56.420
been a game in this series.

37:56.420 --> 38:02.720
They teased it at E3 last year, but that's probably the last we've heard of it.

38:02.720 --> 38:03.720
I don't know.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.720
It'll be neat.

38:04.720 --> 38:10.640
I mean, they need some good family games, I guess, because Viva Pinata's not that great.

38:10.640 --> 38:11.640
No offense.

38:11.640 --> 38:12.640
No, no, no.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.640
There's people that love Viva Pinata.

38:13.640 --> 38:17.960
I think the wrong people that Microsoft thought were going to get into Viva Pinata got into

38:17.960 --> 38:18.960
Viva Pinata.

38:18.960 --> 38:19.960
Here's the thing.

38:19.960 --> 38:25.200
They should take a note from it that they need a good sim game on the Xbox 360, okay?

38:25.200 --> 38:32.600
Then what they should do, though, Viva Pinata, though, it's not like your traditional platform

38:32.600 --> 38:33.600
gamer game.

38:33.600 --> 38:36.960
I think that's going to appeal to a lot of people because they like their Marios and

38:36.960 --> 38:37.960
stuff like that.

38:37.960 --> 38:42.760
But I think Banjo Kazooie is going to have kind of the same effect as Ratchet and Clank

38:42.760 --> 38:44.380
and that kind of stuff.

38:44.380 --> 38:48.520
Maybe not so popular, but it'll still be pretty decent.

38:48.520 --> 38:52.200
Hopefully decent enough for Banjo Kazooie 4 for fans of the series.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.260
So we'll see.

38:55.260 --> 38:58.240
Gold Banjo in chat says Banjo Kazooie is awesome.

38:58.240 --> 38:59.960
That's what my screen name is named after.

38:59.960 --> 39:05.020
So if you want to know where the Banjo in Gold Banjo comes from, there it is.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.020
I was not aware of that.

39:06.020 --> 39:07.440
I was not either, but now I know.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.440
The more you know.

39:08.440 --> 39:09.440
All right.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.440
I know it's half the battle.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
Something else you should be aware of.

39:11.440 --> 39:17.220
If you are cheating on Xbox Live, you're about to get spanked by Microsoft because you've

39:17.220 --> 39:20.100
been very, very naughty.

39:20.100 --> 39:24.400
Here's the deal is that Microsoft has been going through and finding people who have

39:24.400 --> 39:30.880
been cheating in games doing save game hacks and how do people cheat their game or score?

39:30.880 --> 39:31.880
Loki, you ought to know this stuff.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.120
Why would I know this stuff?

39:33.120 --> 39:35.240
Just because I know you would know this stuff.

39:35.240 --> 39:40.900
Well, apparently there's some workarounds that they can actually do where it hacks their

39:40.900 --> 39:44.720
actual profile that you don't even need to play the game to get the achievement points

39:44.720 --> 39:45.720
from.

39:45.720 --> 39:46.720
Wow.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.840
That's what they're really cracking down on is stuff like that.

39:48.840 --> 39:49.840
Interesting.

39:49.840 --> 39:50.840
Well.

39:50.840 --> 39:53.080
Because you can't do the save stuff anymore.

39:53.080 --> 39:57.820
They have that stupid digital rights management thing that they threw in there to fuck everybody

39:57.820 --> 40:00.440
over with everything.

40:00.440 --> 40:04.440
That stopped people from save swapping and stuff like that.

40:04.440 --> 40:10.640
And not all the games worked with save swapping, so it was very unreliable stuff.

40:10.640 --> 40:15.400
Well, here's the thing is that now for these people, their score is getting zapped to zero.

40:15.400 --> 40:18.680
Their gamer score is getting completely erased, gone.

40:18.680 --> 40:23.360
And if you look at their profile on Xbox.com, there's a big old little question mark on

40:23.360 --> 40:26.960
their profile and it says, what happened to their gamer score?

40:26.960 --> 40:28.920
They've been caught cheating.

40:28.920 --> 40:32.800
So now these folks basically get the scarlet question mark, or it's more of the orange

40:32.800 --> 40:35.680
question mark on their profile that labels them as a cheater.

40:35.680 --> 40:41.000
I can't wait because I'm not too optimistic on Microsoft and picking people that cheat.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.800
And I have a feeling they're going to make some mistakes in there and they're going to

40:43.800 --> 40:47.860
pick people that did not cheat and they're going to mark them as cheaters and that's going

40:47.860 --> 40:49.120
to have a whole backlash thing.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.880
I mean, I would just ban these people from Xbox Live.

40:52.880 --> 40:53.880
Why aren't they just doing that?

40:53.880 --> 40:55.240
Because they seem to do that with everything else.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.200
I don't understand why they just have to...

40:57.200 --> 40:58.480
Making examples of them.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.520
Well, that's fine.

40:59.520 --> 41:04.040
I have no problem with them making examples of them, but I have a feeling that they're

41:04.040 --> 41:06.940
going to get some people that really didn't cheat.

41:06.940 --> 41:08.960
Why's it got to be an orange question mark?

41:08.960 --> 41:09.960
What's wrong with orange?

41:09.960 --> 41:11.480
You got a problem with orange, Microsoft?

41:11.480 --> 41:13.480
Why's it got to be an orange question mark?

41:13.480 --> 41:14.480
Jerks.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.920
Well, it's kind of a gold orange.

41:15.920 --> 41:16.920
Shut up.

41:16.920 --> 41:23.440
But, no, I don't think at the same time Microsoft is like running rampant accusing everybody

41:23.440 --> 41:24.440
of being a witch.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.440
You know?

41:25.440 --> 41:26.440
Witch!

41:26.440 --> 41:27.440
Cheetah!

41:27.440 --> 41:28.440
Burn the cheetah!

41:28.440 --> 41:29.440
We found a witch.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.440
May we burn her?

41:30.440 --> 41:35.520
I don't think Microsoft is running through the village accusing everybody of being a

41:35.520 --> 41:36.520
witch.

41:36.520 --> 41:41.720
I think they just targeted some of the high profile people like Strip Club GJ.

41:41.720 --> 41:43.120
You know, that guy.

41:43.120 --> 41:47.720
And I just know him because he actually messaged me once because I got DDR universe the day

41:47.720 --> 41:52.640
it came out and I was playing it all day long and I had like 500 gamer score and I must

41:52.640 --> 41:55.920
have had one of the higher gamer scores I had had anybody that day because he messaged

41:55.920 --> 41:57.880
me and he was like, how was the game?

41:57.880 --> 41:58.880
Is it good?

41:58.880 --> 42:00.560
Is it easy to get the gamer score?

42:00.560 --> 42:04.320
So I remember him because I laughed my ass off when I saw I was getting this message

42:04.320 --> 42:07.840
from him and I heard he was one of the people that got caught with this and sure enough,

42:07.840 --> 42:08.840
yes he is.

42:08.840 --> 42:09.840
Oh, he was?

42:09.840 --> 42:10.840
Yes, he was.

42:10.840 --> 42:16.320
And he's got the profile on Xbox.com and he's got the, he's a witch, witch, witch, witch,

42:16.320 --> 42:17.320
burn him!

42:17.320 --> 42:20.960
I almost have 10,000 gamer points.

42:20.960 --> 42:23.880
No thanks to my friend playing Rock Band for me.

42:23.880 --> 42:27.720
But that's not cheating in the sense of Microsoft cheating.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.720
Sairan says, how do you know it's a cheater?

42:29.720 --> 42:30.720
It looks like one!

42:30.720 --> 42:32.720
They turned me into a Yaris.

42:32.720 --> 42:37.560
Turned me into a- I got better.

42:37.560 --> 42:41.440
Trip Club DJ made me play Yaris.

42:41.440 --> 42:44.360
That's punch like that.

42:44.360 --> 42:45.360
Burn him!

42:45.360 --> 42:47.000
How do you know they're a cheater?

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Build a game out of them!

42:48.000 --> 42:51.900
Let's just hope it doesn't become a witch hunt but Microsoft's been pretty good about

42:51.900 --> 42:55.600
covering their ass because they're saying like, you know, what if somebody calls them

42:55.600 --> 42:57.360
and said my brother did it?

42:57.360 --> 42:59.400
Then Microsoft already has it out there.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.280
Too bad because it's in the terms of agreement.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.680
You're not supposed to share your gamertag with other people.

43:03.680 --> 43:04.680
So nah, nah, nah, nah.

43:04.680 --> 43:08.480
What if you didn't share it but they didn't put any sort of password protection on the

43:08.480 --> 43:12.480
account and when you weren't there, someone used your account and cheated.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.480
Witch!

43:13.480 --> 43:19.160
Because you're a witch and you share your account, evil witch.

43:19.160 --> 43:21.600
Well it's just like- Not all witches are evil!

43:21.600 --> 43:26.480
Just like if your thing read rings or whatever and you happen to have plugged it into a surge

43:26.480 --> 43:27.480
protector.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.040
You're like, oh see, that's why.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.520
That's why our graphics chip fucked up.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.200
It's because you plugged it in a surge protector.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.200
That's true.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.080
We wouldn't want to forget about Glenda the Good Witch.

43:37.080 --> 43:38.080
No.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.080
I know.

43:39.080 --> 43:41.360
Nowadays, being a witch is religious.

43:41.360 --> 43:42.760
I know, I know.

43:42.760 --> 43:43.920
Witch is a very broad term.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.400
You know what we're parodying here, Jamie.

43:45.400 --> 43:56.120
It should be a Goomba hunt.

43:56.120 --> 43:57.760
It should be a release date!

43:57.760 --> 43:59.920
Yeah, how about that?

43:59.920 --> 44:03.760
I got some release dates right here, okay?

44:03.760 --> 44:06.560
Um, I have four.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.880
And two of them are the same game.

44:07.880 --> 44:09.640
Alright, what's that?

44:09.640 --> 44:16.640
So, um, Baroque on the first for PS2 and Wii, and Condemned 2 Bloodshot on Xbox 360 and

44:16.640 --> 44:17.640
PS3.

44:17.640 --> 44:18.640
And that's it.

44:18.640 --> 44:22.440
Now, how can she predict the future about all these games coming out in the UK?

44:22.440 --> 44:24.240
It's because she's a witch!

44:24.240 --> 44:25.240
No.

44:25.240 --> 44:26.240
Witch!

44:26.240 --> 44:27.800
No, it's because I have reliable sources.

44:27.800 --> 44:28.800
Oh, okay.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.800
So, no.

44:29.800 --> 44:30.800
Reliable witch sources!

44:30.800 --> 44:35.040
Alright, let the joke die, Jesus.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.240
And lit some charcoal and read it in the smoke.

44:37.240 --> 44:41.400
No, I want the witch hunt joke to die now before it gets too old.

44:41.400 --> 44:45.040
Just watch, there's going to be a wiki on it now.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.560
I love the OLR wiki more than anything.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.560
It's so great.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.560
Sorry.

44:49.560 --> 44:53.560
Alright, uh, Loki, what's coming out in the US?

44:53.560 --> 44:56.960
Not a whole lot of good stuff, unfortunately.

44:56.960 --> 45:05.840
No, this time around we get some crap, including Rafa Nadal Tennis on the DS.

45:05.840 --> 45:09.440
I think that came out already, but eh, whatever.

45:09.440 --> 45:13.400
It's probably a GameStop exclusive, but that's okay, it sucks.

45:13.400 --> 45:17.600
Octomania got delayed, I guess, a week or so.

45:17.600 --> 45:22.280
That's now coming out on the Wii, $19.99 for a puzzle game, and it has online, so that's

45:22.280 --> 45:23.280
not bad.

45:23.280 --> 45:26.040
And it's Atlus, you gotta support Atlus.

45:26.040 --> 45:34.360
And let's see, Mana Kima Alchemist of Aurovis, and that's a new Koei RPG for Playstation

45:34.360 --> 45:36.420
2.

45:36.420 --> 45:42.120
There's a game called Toy Shop, which is coming out on the DS, I guess it's like a sim toy

45:42.120 --> 45:44.240
shop game.

45:44.240 --> 45:48.520
And let's see here, Call of Duty 4 Game of the Year Edition, that's coming out on the

45:48.520 --> 45:49.700
first as well.

45:49.700 --> 45:56.080
That's just a re-release of Call of Duty 4 with the downloadable map pack, or token for

45:56.080 --> 45:57.080
that.

45:57.080 --> 46:01.080
So if you don't have it yet, that's probably the way you want to go.

46:01.080 --> 46:14.520
And let's see here, there's also World Championship cards on the PSP, but that's pretty much it.

46:14.520 --> 46:17.760
Let's head on over to Japan and look at the release dates over there, really nothing to

46:17.760 --> 46:20.720
look forward to on Xbox 360, I'm sorry to say.

46:20.720 --> 46:27.280
There is stuff on Playstation 3, if you like Eye of Judgment, you can get some of the expansions

46:27.280 --> 46:29.520
over there, that's about it.

46:29.520 --> 46:34.880
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, gosh, really not a lot there as well.

46:34.880 --> 46:39.360
This is a very slow week in Japan as far as the next gen systems go.

46:39.360 --> 46:47.160
Well on the Playstation 2 you get Pro Yaku Spirits 5 comes out, which is another baseball

46:47.160 --> 46:51.160
simulator game, so there's that, I suppose, to look forward to.

46:51.160 --> 46:54.440
And let's see if there's anything on the handhelds, surely there's got to be something on the

46:54.440 --> 46:55.440
Nintendo DS.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.320
No, there's really not.

46:57.320 --> 47:02.640
Oh, on April 3rd there is some stuff coming out.

47:02.640 --> 47:11.400
Let's see, there's One High Ten Fun de Igaju Zunikakuru DS, from Bondi comes a game called

47:11.400 --> 47:13.400
Detective Conan.

47:13.400 --> 47:16.120
That's an interesting and old school anime series.

47:16.120 --> 47:21.100
There's a new game coming out there, and this game coming from a group called FonFon, is

47:21.100 --> 47:28.160
the publisher for this one, Kuchan no Shiwashi Kantan Oriuri Recipe comes out, and it looks

47:28.160 --> 47:32.240
like a cooking game, or it could be, I don't think it's cooking, I think this is actually

47:32.240 --> 47:33.240
like a virtual cookbook.

47:33.240 --> 47:36.560
It looks like it has like 300 recipes in a little virtual cookbook.

47:36.560 --> 47:40.360
They were supposed to release something like that out here, but they never did.

47:40.360 --> 47:43.320
Well you can import this one, except I hope you can read Japanese, or it's really not

47:43.320 --> 47:44.760
going to do you a lot of good.

47:44.760 --> 47:48.160
Well then you probably aren't going to be able to do it.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.720
Anything on the PSP?

47:49.720 --> 47:54.440
Yes, Star Ocean Second Evolution comes out on the Sony PSP from Squeenix.

47:54.440 --> 47:55.440
That's pretty cool.

47:55.440 --> 47:58.280
Yeah, so that would probably be one of the bigger releases in Japan this week, otherwise

47:58.280 --> 48:00.640
you've got to really wait until next week.

48:00.640 --> 48:04.540
Not a lot of big releases in Japan this week, I guess it's a slow week all around, but probably

48:04.540 --> 48:07.800
because we're kind of in a little bit of a slow period until we get into like the summer

48:07.800 --> 48:11.760
games, then we'll see a lot of stuff.

48:11.760 --> 48:16.100
Out of curiosity real quick before we get into the next story, because summer games

48:16.100 --> 48:21.800
reminded me, there's the Olympics this year, yet outside of Mario and Sonic at the Olympics,

48:21.800 --> 48:25.920
I haven't heard of a lot of like Beijing video games.

48:25.920 --> 48:26.920
What's up with that?

48:26.920 --> 48:29.520
It seems like every year there's an Olympics, there's some horrible games.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.320
Sega is putting out an Olympics game in June.

48:31.320 --> 48:32.320
Is there?

48:32.320 --> 48:33.320
Oh, okay.

48:33.320 --> 48:38.200
Beijing Olympics, oh wait, so yeah, there is one coming.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.200
Is it coming on the Wii?

48:39.200 --> 48:41.720
PS3 and Xbox 360.

48:41.720 --> 48:42.720
No Wii.

48:42.720 --> 48:46.160
Oh, maybe they don't want it to interview with Mario and Sonic at the Olympics one.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.160
Interesting.

48:47.160 --> 48:51.560
I don't know about that, but there is one coming.

48:51.560 --> 48:52.960
Interesting.

48:52.960 --> 48:57.400
What are you giggling about over there, dare I ask?

48:57.400 --> 49:02.840
I'm looking at the listener profiles on our wiki, and while still you tease is great.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.640
Poor guy.

49:04.640 --> 49:05.640
I know, I'm sorry.

49:05.640 --> 49:06.760
Stop picking on him.

49:06.760 --> 49:14.560
I didn't want to pick on him, but I just did not expect it, so I was like, okay.

49:14.560 --> 49:17.100
Gerardimo said, Sky, why is that bad?

49:17.100 --> 49:22.800
It's not necessarily bad, I'm just curious, and usually these Olympic games are fucking

49:22.800 --> 49:26.960
horrible anyway, but I'm just curious, because I was surprised I haven't heard a lot about

49:26.960 --> 49:30.320
tie-in games when the Beijing Olympics are kind of a big deal.

49:30.320 --> 49:31.880
You want to hear something weird?

49:31.880 --> 49:32.880
What's that?

49:32.880 --> 49:37.480
That's a tough topic here, but next week there's a game, or not next week, but the week after

49:37.480 --> 49:40.600
next there's a game on the DS coming out called Plushies.

49:40.600 --> 49:42.480
That reminds me of like, Furries.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.480
Oh no.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.880
I want my ferret, Rob.

49:45.880 --> 49:46.880
Let the jokes begin.

49:46.880 --> 49:48.920
I want my ferret.

49:48.920 --> 49:49.920
You want the ferret?

49:49.920 --> 49:50.920
Yeah.

49:50.920 --> 49:54.440
We might be able to make that happen, but not unless you read us more news.

49:54.440 --> 49:58.520
I have some news.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.760
Sony has said they're sorry.

50:00.760 --> 50:05.760
We already knew they were sorry, but they've also apologized too.

50:05.760 --> 50:12.060
They now have some updates to the PS3 store, and one of them is Gran Turismo 5 Prologue,

50:12.060 --> 50:21.320
which for the UK is $24.99, with UEFA Euro 2008 demo and Unreal Tournament 3 for free,

50:21.320 --> 50:29.960
and Turok Map Packs for $1.99, and the Eye of Judgment Bio-Rebellion card set for $6.99.

50:29.960 --> 50:39.800
Also PS1 Reel Fishing has been added for $3.49 to PS3 and PSP stores.

50:39.800 --> 50:47.280
Oh, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, give me.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.280
Hi ferret.

50:49.280 --> 50:51.880
It has a ferret now.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.960
Yes, I found the damn ferret.

50:53.960 --> 50:55.860
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

50:55.860 --> 50:59.920
There's also trailers on the PS3 store for Everybody's Golf World Tour, Eye of Judgment,

50:59.920 --> 51:14.720
GT5 Prologue, Dark Sector, and Dynasty Warriors 6, and Sony said, we sorry, poo, poo on us.

51:14.720 --> 51:17.440
Somehow I don't think they phrased it quite like that.

51:17.440 --> 51:22.200
To quote, as previously mentioned, we unfortunately experienced some last minute technical difficulties

51:22.200 --> 51:24.960
and weren't able to publish the new content as planned.

51:24.960 --> 51:29.160
However, we have been working hard to resolve these issues and are pleased to be able to

51:29.160 --> 51:33.240
let you know that basically they're all live on the UK store.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.880
Yeah, this is specific, by the way, to the UK store.

51:35.880 --> 51:42.320
But hey, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue PAL is out, so if you want to play an extended demo,

51:42.320 --> 51:43.320
go for it.

51:43.320 --> 51:49.040
I was going to say also in the US, they made some announcements of upcoming stuff, not

51:49.040 --> 51:51.180
necessarily anything coming out right away.

51:51.180 --> 51:55.280
But late April, we're going to be getting the Pixel Junk Monsters Encore, which is an

51:55.280 --> 51:59.520
expansion pack to, of course, Pixel Junk Monsters.

51:59.520 --> 52:06.120
Early May, we're going to be getting Echo Chrome, and in May sometime, Elephunk.

52:06.120 --> 52:10.160
And then late May, or early June, Wipeout HD.

52:10.160 --> 52:11.160
So that's pretty cool.

52:11.160 --> 52:15.040
They had some pretty interesting videos for Wipeout, some of them make a pack or something

52:15.040 --> 52:16.040
that got released.

52:16.040 --> 52:22.240
They had some really trippy, kind of like cartoony tracks, I don't know.

52:22.240 --> 52:28.560
So definitely check those out if you own Wipeout Pulse on the PSP, it should be on the Playstation

52:28.560 --> 52:29.560
store.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.680
You can download those.

52:31.680 --> 52:33.880
Okay.

52:33.880 --> 52:36.440
Some other fun stuff, of course...

52:36.440 --> 52:37.560
Hey, guess what?

52:37.560 --> 52:41.400
Bobby said he didn't need to make one creative change to our show, and that is that no more

52:41.400 --> 52:42.400
ferret.

52:42.400 --> 52:43.400
Ferret, no.

52:43.400 --> 52:46.840
The batteries are going to die in that thing.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.560
You know that we've had that thing for as long as we've been doing this show?

52:49.560 --> 52:50.560
It's mascot.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.200
Those batteries are going to die someday.

52:52.200 --> 52:53.880
The ferret is eternal.

52:53.880 --> 52:54.880
No they won't.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.880
You don't understand, Rob.

52:56.880 --> 53:00.320
You can rip them open and put new batteries in, that's how I got those other ones to work.

53:00.320 --> 53:02.840
Why do you have to fucking tell her how to do it?

53:02.840 --> 53:08.400
Like seriously, you could smile and nod and say, yes, Rob, the ferret will die.

53:08.400 --> 53:12.720
But no, you have to say, oh, we can give it a lobotomy.

53:12.720 --> 53:17.760
There's almost a bald spot now from where I've been pressing it in the same spot.

53:17.760 --> 53:18.760
That's ferret abuse.

53:18.760 --> 53:20.960
I'm sorry, are we a video game podcast?

53:20.960 --> 53:26.040
We're the food and ferret cast.

53:26.040 --> 53:31.840
But then you had to mention Bobby and it, you know, halted the show.

53:31.840 --> 53:38.080
Anyways, so Grand Theft Auto IV, of course they like to innovate with each new release

53:38.080 --> 53:39.080
that they're coming out.

53:39.080 --> 53:40.680
Now this is something very interesting.

53:40.680 --> 53:44.760
What they're actually going to incorporate into Grand Theft Auto IV is real world music

53:44.760 --> 53:48.900
downloads, and it's going to be tied in with Amazon.com.

53:48.900 --> 53:52.920
Now the way this works is in the game, you can actually call an in-game service called

53:52.920 --> 53:59.960
Zit on your mobile phone, and you get text messages with song and artist names, as well

53:59.960 --> 54:03.880
as an email if you're a member of the Rockstar Social Club.

54:03.880 --> 54:10.600
And then when you download tracks or whatever, they're going to be about 89 cents to 99 cents,

54:10.600 --> 54:14.720
and they'll actually, of course they're DRM free because they're MP3s, but I guess you

54:14.720 --> 54:19.860
can download them in-game and you also get them in the real world.

54:19.860 --> 54:29.160
So that's pretty cool that you'll be able to download some music.

54:29.160 --> 54:33.080
Somebody by the nickname of Beatmania Slot Machine in our chat room says, Orange Ferret

54:33.080 --> 54:34.080
Fudio.

54:34.080 --> 54:37.240
Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood this a little bit.

54:37.240 --> 54:42.340
It's actually, okay, the way this works is the soundtrack for the game, so the music

54:42.340 --> 54:47.760
actually inside the game, not additional music, so if you hear a song you like on the radio

54:47.760 --> 54:52.400
or something like that, you can dial that service in the game and then get the MP3 sent

54:52.400 --> 54:53.400
to you.

54:53.400 --> 54:55.840
I do have to make a comment to Beatmania Slot Machine.

54:55.840 --> 54:56.840
What's that?

54:56.840 --> 54:59.300
It's actually not a slot machine, it's a Pachi slot.

54:59.300 --> 55:00.520
But we'll get to that later.

55:00.520 --> 55:02.920
Don't spoil the upcoming news stories.

55:02.920 --> 55:03.920
Don't spoil them.

55:03.920 --> 55:04.920
I'm just kidding.

55:04.920 --> 55:10.760
But I assume since this is an Xbox 360 game and a PS3 game that you'll be able to put

55:10.760 --> 55:14.640
your own music in there anyways, so that'd be cool.

55:14.640 --> 55:18.400
Aren't they doing this in real cars, too, or at least I know there's that whole like

55:18.400 --> 55:22.000
cell phone thing, like isn't there a commercial on TV for like Verizon or something where

55:22.000 --> 55:26.320
like you hold up your cell phone and it will recognize the song and download it for you

55:26.320 --> 55:27.320
or something like that?

55:27.320 --> 55:28.920
Yeah, there's stuff like that out there.

55:28.920 --> 55:32.520
Of course they want people to have the big red button.

55:32.520 --> 55:33.520
What is that?

55:33.520 --> 55:34.520
Staples?

55:34.520 --> 55:36.720
Is that the chain that has the commercials with the big easy button that you just press

55:36.720 --> 55:38.240
it and it does things for you?

55:38.240 --> 55:43.400
Of course retailers want that with your shopping, one button shopping, because how easy is it

55:43.400 --> 55:45.560
to push a button to get something?

55:45.560 --> 55:49.240
Because there's that whole mental thing of instant gratification, which is what this

55:49.240 --> 55:50.920
whole society is about.

55:50.920 --> 55:55.320
You're not physically taking the money out of your wallet and handing it to somebody

55:55.320 --> 55:56.320
or your purse or whatever.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.080
You're not handing it to somebody.

55:58.080 --> 56:02.300
Therefore it's so much easier to make these stupid impulse buys.

56:02.300 --> 56:06.320
And I think this whole feature, while it's interesting and kind of cool, I guess, for

56:06.320 --> 56:11.320
a video game is kind of capitalizing on that, because you know there are going to be a lot

56:11.320 --> 56:14.680
of people that buy this game and there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be

56:14.680 --> 56:18.160
like, oh, I like this game, click, oh, I just spent a dollar.

56:18.160 --> 56:19.160
But it's just a dollar.

56:19.160 --> 56:20.560
That's what I hate about iTunes.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.400
But I clicked 20 times.

56:22.400 --> 56:25.080
Well, iTunes is almost the same type of thing.

56:25.080 --> 56:26.080
That's what I was saying.

56:26.080 --> 56:29.860
That's what I hate about iTunes, especially since it's on my damn phone.

56:29.860 --> 56:34.280
But at the same time, I like iTunes, but it's a love-hate relationship.

56:34.280 --> 56:40.920
I love iTunes, I love the way it organizes my music and everything, but I do find myself,

56:40.920 --> 56:45.440
it's far too easy to just go, oh, it's just 99 cents for a song, 300 songs later, oh,

56:45.440 --> 56:46.440
I'm broke.

56:46.440 --> 56:51.280
I've gone how many years without buying a damn thing on iTunes until I got my phone?

56:51.280 --> 56:55.800
And then I probably, I'm still okay, I probably only bought like 25 songs total.

56:55.800 --> 56:56.840
It's that convenience.

56:56.840 --> 56:57.840
I'm telling you.

56:57.840 --> 56:58.840
We're such a lazy society.

56:58.840 --> 57:04.320
I mean, it's not necessarily like, I'm not saying like, oh, you're bad or, you know,

57:04.320 --> 57:05.320
oh, you're, but it's just kind of where we are.

57:05.320 --> 57:08.640
I think it's more putting the temptation in there because honestly, and this is how me

57:08.640 --> 57:14.160
personally I am, I believe that the things worth having are worth working for, you know.

57:14.160 --> 57:17.360
It's like, it's like I'm putting a giant cookie, no, no, I got it.

57:17.360 --> 57:20.160
I'm putting a giant piece of pastrami in your hands.

57:20.160 --> 57:23.440
I'm not that big on pastrami.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.080
I wanted pastrami today.

57:26.080 --> 57:27.080
So I got pastrami.

57:27.080 --> 57:28.080
Okay, finally.

57:28.080 --> 57:29.080
Press button.

57:29.080 --> 57:30.080
Get pastrami.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.080
Fine.

57:31.080 --> 57:32.080
Then I put a big bottle of Goldschlager in your hand.

57:32.080 --> 57:33.080
I don't like Goldschlager.

57:33.080 --> 57:34.080
And I say, well, God damn it.

57:34.080 --> 57:35.080
What is something you like?

57:35.080 --> 57:36.080
Here's what I want.

57:36.080 --> 57:37.080
I like sushi.

57:37.080 --> 57:38.080
Okay.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.080
Sushi.

57:39.080 --> 57:42.720
I put a big piece of sushi in your hand and I say, hold on to this for a little bit.

57:42.720 --> 57:47.900
By the way, if you eat that, you can eat it, but it will cost you a couple bucks.

57:47.900 --> 57:48.900
And you're going, gulp.

57:48.900 --> 57:51.280
You're like, oh, it's just a couple bucks, gulp.

57:51.280 --> 57:54.000
Look, here, hold this piece too.

57:54.000 --> 57:59.360
It's like hotel rooms at more upscale, I mean, obviously they don't have it at Motel 6, but

57:59.360 --> 58:04.040
the more upscale type motels, they'll have all the candy and shit sitting out right there

58:04.040 --> 58:05.040
on the table.

58:05.040 --> 58:09.120
And it's like, hey, if you open it, two bucks.

58:09.120 --> 58:10.120
What a terrible thing if you brought kids on the trip.

58:10.120 --> 58:11.120
It's a freaking minibar.

58:11.120 --> 58:12.120
So you know what I do?

58:12.120 --> 58:13.120
Mm-hmm.

58:13.120 --> 58:15.040
I go grocery store down the street and buy me a bottle.

58:15.040 --> 58:16.040
That's what you got to do.

58:16.040 --> 58:17.040
All right.

58:17.040 --> 58:18.040
Sorry.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.040
Tangent.

58:19.040 --> 58:20.220
What are we without our tangents?

58:20.220 --> 58:21.220
That's right.

58:21.220 --> 58:27.400
I was just going to say, I want a service on Xbox Live where I can pay for a pizza with

58:27.400 --> 58:29.480
Microsoft points.

58:29.480 --> 58:30.480
Slash pizza?

58:30.480 --> 58:31.480
Yeah.

58:31.480 --> 58:34.200
But why shouldn't I be able to get one?

58:34.200 --> 58:35.200
Wait.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.400
I bet that type of stuff is only a matter of time away.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.400
Only a matter of time.

58:39.400 --> 58:43.760
I want to be able to stop, pause my game for a second, order pizza.

58:43.760 --> 58:48.060
I guess I could just call up a pizza place and play the game at the same time, but we're

58:48.060 --> 58:51.020
talking about integration, so why not?

58:51.020 --> 58:53.860
But once you get sick of pizza, I mean...

58:53.860 --> 58:54.860
I worked at a pizza place.

58:54.860 --> 58:55.860
No, I don't get sick of pizza.

58:55.860 --> 59:00.120
This is why I love internet TV, you know, because me and every...

59:00.120 --> 59:04.040
I've made it perfectly clear, I hate being a slave to my television.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.880
I hate having to...

59:05.880 --> 59:10.760
And you know, I don't see any money of paying for a DVR when I can just go online and watch

59:10.760 --> 59:11.760
whatever.

59:11.760 --> 59:13.360
You want to hear something that's going to be really bad?

59:13.360 --> 59:17.280
Wait till Spore comes out and they have that service where you can create your character

59:17.280 --> 59:19.320
and then get a figurine of it.

59:19.320 --> 59:25.280
Like, oh my god, that looks awesome, figurine, figurine, figurine, and they deliver this

59:25.280 --> 59:27.720
giant crate of figures for your house.

59:27.720 --> 59:32.260
Nope, I actually would do that, but then again, I also go back and have drawn fan art of my

59:32.260 --> 59:34.520
PSO character in the past, so...

59:34.520 --> 59:38.320
I'll do it too, and I like crappy things made by me, that's why.

59:38.320 --> 59:43.200
Hey everybody, pay me 20 bucks and I'll draw your RPG character.

59:43.200 --> 59:48.000
Did you have another thought you were trying to finish, Jamie, I'm sorry.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Dot dot dot.

59:49.000 --> 59:56.120
I love this comment from rawstealut in regards to the pizza being sold on Xbox Live Marketplace,

59:56.120 --> 59:59.520
but then the pizza would be DRM protected and you'd not be able to eat it if something

59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520
went wrong before it got delivered.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.520
I remember what I was saying.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.520
Okay.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:08.560
What I was saying is that, you know, as long as you have a computer near you, anything

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:12.200
is convenient, because like I was saying, I don't watch TV, but I'll watch whatever

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:17.760
I can on the internet and do all of my other stuff, and I've ordered stuff through online

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:23.240
services before, you know, like, you know, if we were going to order from, like, say

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.000
if Dan and I wanted pizza, you can order online at some places while I'm doing plenty of other

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
things.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.360
So, I mean, really, this whole society is about nothing but convenience, and I'm like,

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.440
dude, just go out and get it.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.440
Better yet.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.460
You order, like, Pizza Hut or something like that, because they're kind of affiliated with,

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:44.040
I know, I know, I prefer Roundtable, but that's regional, and, you know, Pizza Hut, they did

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.760
the whole affiliation with, you know, Xbox and stuff like that.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:54.320
So, you order, like, a Pizza Hut pizza, and they have a card from Microsoft Points taped

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.040
to the top of the box, and that'd be cool, like, you know, 500 points or something like

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.520
that.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.960
That would give me the order more Pizza Hut.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960
We'll see.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.940
RawsteelUT says, why stop at pizza?

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.680
Order sushi, Chinese, and hamburgers.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.360
Or even better, you order the past day and you get a downloadable content or something

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.640
like that for Grand Theft Auto, where you can actually have, you know, your Pizza Hut

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.680
outfit for your character, and you get a pizza in-game.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.680
That's integration.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.520
They need to hire us as marketing consultants.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.560
I want to bring a soundboard with us to all games.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560
What do you think?

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.560
You think Bobby would love that?

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.960
If we take a soundboard with us to all games?

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:31.960
That would be fantastic.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.880
And hey, Geronimo, Papa John's got me through college.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.200
I think we need an actual soundboard first, you know.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.200
We'll work on it.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:45.560
I just don't want to go crazy with it because, you know, I don't want to go crazy with a

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.720
soundboard, but sometimes it's just too good.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720
All right.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720
Anyhow, sorry.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.720
Back to video gaming news.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.800
Well, actually, I wouldn't say this is gaming news, Morris.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.200
It is gaming rumor.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.480
That is big, big rumor.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.520
Apparently the achievements for Grand Theft Auto IV have hit the internet.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.640
Two different websites have posted the 50 different achievements that are supposed to

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.500
be in the game.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:12.280
Some of the achievements are supposed to include things like hidden packages, doing types of

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:17.080
stunt jumping, completing certain missions, beating mini games.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.720
Some of the other features, though, are a little weird.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.920
Here's some sample achievements.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.460
Manhunt will get you a 15 gamer score.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:29.960
Complete the most wanted side missions from the police computer.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.840
Warm Coffee, successfully date a girl to be invited into her house.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:42.040
That's true, that's a pretty bold achievement, Warm Coffee.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.960
Let Sleeping Rockstars Lie, 10 gamer score.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.480
Kill a rockstar developer in a ranked multiplayer match.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.480
I can see that.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.320
There's just been a couple games that have things like that, Kill the Creator or something

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.320
like that.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.320
That would be sweet.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.320
I don't know.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.840
I mean, like, they kind of sound legitimate, but she...

01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.840
I think it's legit.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:07.320
The gamer, you know, the profile that they show the gamer score for is one of the rockstar

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:13.160
internal gamer tags or whatever like that, so I'd buy it.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:18.040
And it sounds legit, and I think that something by now would be leaked out, and who cares?

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040
It's just gamer score.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.880
It's not like it's spoiling the game or anything.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.880
True.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.920
Although they had some interesting things in there, like you can play pool, there's

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.440
an arcade game that's built into it, and you can bowl, so...

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.080
I kind of knew a lot of that stuff was coming, though, because Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.080
City had a lot of that.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.440
I think it's going to be awesome, and when this game comes out, I'll just have to become

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.160
a hermit for a while, so...

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.440
Nice knowing you.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:50.000
Well, a lot of people have been waiting for the Gran Turismo 5 prologue, but they're going

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.760
to have to wait even longer for the actual thing, because they're saying it's still

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.200
about a year away.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:03.840
So, if you want any type of Gran Turismo 5 at all, your best bet is to get the glorified

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.360
demo on April 17th.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.600
My problem with the fact that this game's a year away is, assuming that they're using

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.200
the same engine, and I hope to God that they're not by the time we get around to that, it's

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.480
going to be so outdated.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.680
By that time, you're going to have like, Forza 3, and so many other games that do what they

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.040
do a lot better.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.840
I don't know, it's just kind of like, not worth it at this point.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:32.680
Why does it take them so long to model cars when, you know, fucking Project Gotham and

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.840
all these other games, you know, have cars that look good as well, and they're well modeled?

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.160
I don't understand what's taking them so long to get this game done.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.200
It's like everyone seems to be doing it a lot faster.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.180
That's a quilt Hippo asks in chat, he says, why the hell do these Gran Turismo games take

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.180
so damn long?

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.080
Does it take that long to sample engine noises?

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.520
I mean, the game looks good, don't get me wrong, but it's just, it's not that much better

01:04:54.520 --> 01:05:00.200
than like, Project Gotham or Forza, I mean, or even there's like Grid coming up that looks

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.360
pretty awesome.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.520
I just, I don't see what, you know, they're putting a lot of time in it, you know, it's

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.700
kind of like Duke Nukem Forever type, I mean, not so bad, but, you know, Duke Nukem Forever,

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.000
they're putting all this effort and time into it, and then by the time it comes out, it's

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.480
just going to be kind of, it'll be good, but it won't be like, whoa, awesome, you know,

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:27.320
I just, you know, Gran Turismo 5 I'm sure will be really big for PlayStation, but will

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.200
it really be that big of an achievement?

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.560
I mean, I don't know.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.840
I just don't understand why it's taking them so long for this game when, you know, Microsoft

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:43.240
and other companies can push out these games really quick, is my thing.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:49.720
Well, it's just kind of, I don't know, I hope it's worth the wait for the fans of the series.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.640
I really hope it is.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:58.320
So there's an interesting rumors going around by, about a possible redesign and the newer

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.200
PSP.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:05.720
Of course, you may remember the original PSP, which is known as the 1000 series, and the

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.280
newer PSP Slim, which is the 2000 series.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:15.840
Well, apparently there is a third design in the works, and actually as part of an online

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:25.160
document for, you know, PlayStation.net, they actually have an image for the 3000 series.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:31.680
So apparently it does exist, or it will be coming, so there will be yet maybe another

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:37.380
redesign to the PlayStation portable console, and I mean, after all, they were talking that

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:44.120
it was going to be a 10 year life cycle for this portable system, so I can see them making

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.120
some more revisions, but I think it's kind of interesting.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.120
Kind of sucks for people that bought, you know, the Slim and the original and stuff

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.120
like that.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.120
Now they have to buy a third one.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:57.840
Seriously, this news alone is making me contemplate not getting, because I was thinking about

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.260
getting the Slim just because I wanted the video out, and you know, my PSP is getting

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.640
kind of old, and I kind of wanted to get a newer one.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.120
They're coming down a lot in price, but now that I'm like, oh, there's another one that's

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.760
going to come out, I'm kind of like, well, maybe I ought to wait.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.360
Remember some other company that did the exact same thing, the Gizmondo?

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.240
Remember how they're like, hey, you know what, we're going to have this system.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.760
Oh, by the way, it hasn't released yet, but we're already doing a revision on it, and

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.520
you're like, eh, I'm just going to wait until the new one comes out, and then no one bought

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.520
it.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.360
But, you know, I've got to wonder, like, you know, Nintendo kind of does the same thing.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:34.680
Yes, but at the same time, I mean, here's the only difference between, I think, the

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.000
DS Lite and the PSP.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.800
The PSP Slim, it limits you to what options you have available for you when you're playing

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800
it.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:49.280
Like, there's certain, you know, applications that you cannot use on, you know, the fatter

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:54.760
PSP, and also, the newer PSPs have more RAM and other stuff like that, whereas the DS

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.760
...

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.760
And shorter battery life.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:00.280
No, the battery life is just the same, and actually, I think a little bit more improved,

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.720
but the fact is that...

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.360
Well, your friend's wrong.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:11.120
Anyway, so they have, you know, the DS Lite, it basically is a bit slimmer and has, you

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.320
know, a brighter screen, but that's about it.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:21.240
I mean, most things that run on the DS Lite will also run on the original DS as well.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.800
There's not anything that says, okay, you have to have this, you know, version of the

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.960
hardware in order to be able to play this.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960
That's my only thing.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.400
You know, there were three different versions of the Game Boy Advance.

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.440
There was that first one that wasn't backlit, there was the second one that came out that

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.840
was backlit, and then there was the real miniature one that could go on, like, your keychain.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.840
So...

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.840
I have a micro.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.720
Yeah, the Game Boy Advance, the SP, and the micro.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.720
That's it.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720
The SP was ill, and then the micro, yeah.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.320
The micro got me through many a line in E3.

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.960
The micro was such a waste of time.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.360
But the micro didn't do very well overall, you know.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360
No, but I love it.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.280
The only problem it sucked for is playing...

01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.280
RPGs or anything with text?

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.520
Well, no, even text wasn't so bad.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.520
It was playing any type of shooter.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.520
I don't know.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.360
I think it's, I guess it's, you know, inevitable that they're going to need to update the system

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.520
since you're not going to just come out with a PSP2 yet.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.460
But I don't know, that kind of still sucks for someone that just bought the system.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.460
But...

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.080
You should be used to it by now.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.520
I'm sure this PSP 3000 will be unhackable, completely unhackable in any way.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:35.840
All right, well let's move on to another Sony related story, and that has to do with a much

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:39.080
anticipated title, Metal Gear Solid 4.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:46.080
The pre-order DVDs are shipping, and they come with that Metal Gear Online beta keys,

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.560
and it does announce that the beta is going to begin on April 21st.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.720
You can download the Metal Gear Online beta on April 17th, so I guess they're giving a

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.680
little bit of time so that maybe the servers don't all get hammered at once, which probably

01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.960
isn't a bad idea.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:05.500
May 5th is when the beta runs until, so that actually isn't a whole lot of time, but...

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:10.240
I forgot, I downloaded, well I haven't quite downloaded it yet, but I'm in the Battlefield

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.000
Bad Company beta, which I hear wasn't very good, but I still haven't got a chance to

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
play it yet.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Hopefully next week I'll be able to talk about it a little bit, but that was another one

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
that was interesting.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.400
I'll be very curious to hear from some of our listeners who are in on this.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:31.000
I haven't ordered this because I don't really follow Metal Gear Online quite rapidly, but

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.360
I'd be really curious to hear from some of our fans on how this goes, how the online

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.080
beta is.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:40.200
I'm sure there will be plenty of YouTubes and all that stuff, but I like to hear the

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.160
first-hand experiences.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:51.200
Well, for our listeners in Europe, there actually may be an 80GB PlayStation 3 out by this summer.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:11:00.880
Right now there's only the 40GB version, but there is a little bit of talk going around

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.560
that indicates there is going to be an 80GB model coming out.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:13.080
So far Sony isn't really doing a good job at saying no about it, so maybe it is.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.620
And there's actually no comment if it's going to even be backwards compatible or anything

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.620
else good.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:21.620
I'm going to guess and say it probably will be as backwards compatible as the 80s over

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.180
here.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.400
Now my question for Europe is, do you want it?

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.600
I mean, do you really want it?

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.880
Here would be my thing for Europe, okay?

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:37.040
They just announced that they're going to release the 80GB system there, and they're

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.640
kind of doing a new one for us with the Metal Gear Solid bundle, and I know the same thing

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:47.080
in Japan, but if you just wait a few more months, I will bet you anything in the fall

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.520
they will announce yet another SKU, so just like we were talking about before with the

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:57.580
PSP and stuff, just wait a little longer, because unless there's something you really

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.360
need to play right away, you can probably wait a few more months for the better games

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.200
to be coming out towards the falls, and by that time you can get probably a newer system

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:14.660
with better features for either the same price or less, so that would be my recommendation.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:20.720
Another game you should definitely wait on buying is Eye of Judgment, and actually the

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:26.720
Eye of Judgment expansion has been having some delays coming to retail, and the reason

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:36.360
for this, Sony says, is transportation issues, so they were having some problem, I guess,

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:41.400
getting it from Wizards of the Coast to retailers.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.800
Hear that, or someone hijacked the trucks?

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.800
Was that you?

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.780
Were you trying to get sales to not go up?

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:52.400
That wasn't me at all.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:58.280
Actually it was, according to them, was it, the North American delay can be blamed on

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:05.720
transportation delays from European distributors of Eye of Judgment Byleth Rebellion 2 trading

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:12.280
cards, and they have yet to set a new launch date for the software and cards, but plan

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:16.400
to do so in the near future.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.760
That's okay, everyone can buy the expansion because there's not a lot of people that own

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.760
the game.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.160
I wonder if anyone at Wizards of the Coast has heard of the Loki bet.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.480
Does anyone really care?

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.440
Sadly, yes, a lot of our listeners seem to care.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.440
Well, they care.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.440
I don't know what it is.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.640
But Wizards of the Coast couldn't give a rat's ass.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.720
Probably not.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.040
Let's see.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:44.240
Eye of Judgment plus Let's Ride Friends Forever equals Tingle, Cheeseburger's reminder that

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:47.280
we also get to count the sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever in the deck.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.000
Yeah, all five of those.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.040
All right, anyhow, one more story for you guys this segment before we get into the classic

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.040
game of the week.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.200
And those of you guys that remember the good old days of OLR, you can appreciate this.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.880
It's something that was alluded to a little bit earlier.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:08.120
There is now a Pochi slot machine, which really kind of looks like a slot machine to me.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:11.200
And oh, I was going to play the video for you guys, but it just got the SmackDown taken

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.200
off of YouTube.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.200
I've got another one.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.080
That's all right, don't worry about it.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.000
Video doesn't do very good over the radio anyway.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.600
But basically what happens, and I watched it earlier, it looked like a slot machine

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.480
to me, like one of those more like video slot machines you'd see in the casinos.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.800
Basically with the slots coming down, when certain symbols come up, you play like a Beat

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:37.600
Mania bonus game, and you use the buttons on the thing to control Beat Mania.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.600
And you know what?

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.320
Here's something else that's kind of cool.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.240
That's not the only game that's gotten a slot version as well.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.240
Well, what else?

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240
Ridge Racer!

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.920
Yeah, that was also on Kotaku this week.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.800
Did you get to control that?

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.800
I don't know.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:01.360
But they should have like, you know, Kran eating Ken come out and yell, Ridge Racer!

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.040
There's also an Evangelion one.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.880
Well, there are 11 different songs on 3 different difficulties, Easy, Medium, and Hard.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.840
So it's certainly not as comprehensive as a new Beat Mania 2DX mix, but nevertheless

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:19.360
it is kind of interesting to see the world of Beat Mania and slot machines combined.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.760
There's also a Parodius Apache slot that I think I've talked about before.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.600
You ever play like slot machines that they have?

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.000
Because you don't really gamble, do you?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
You don't really play slot machines.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.880
I used to play that Fox Hunt one.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.880
Fox Hunt?

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.460
That was at the place.

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:37.800
When I was in Reno last, the one I played a lot of was called the Frog Prince.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.200
You know, and it's basically one where the bonus level is that you kiss different frogs

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.480
and you try to find the one that becomes a prince?

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.720
It was the dumbest game, but it was for some reason making me a lot of money that night.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.760
Well, I was playing pennies, so it was making me a few dollars, which is a lot in pennies,

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.160
so that's why I stuck with it.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.400
But I bring up slot machines and all that, because you know Konami makes a lot of slot

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400
machines.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.240
Even the ones you see over here, they make quite a few of those slot machines.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.160
It's like another business of theirs we never really talk about.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.040
So I see many of their franchises go into those slot machines and Apache slots.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:14.720
I mean, honestly.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.240
So how about we get into the Classic Game of the Week?

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.240
That sounds like a plan.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.480
All right, you know what we do here at Orange Launch Radio at the end of Part A when our

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.880
show is winding down here?

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:30.560
We like to pay tribute and respect to gaming's classics, and DarkSakura likes to look through

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:33.780
her archive of games and pick a classic one for you every week.

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:37.840
We call it DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.880
What classic game should the kids be playing this week, DarkSakura?

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.920
Well, this is actually one of my favorite RPGs ever, except honestly it's actually one

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:51.320
of the few that I've played quite a bit through in Japanese, until I had a little problem

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.320
playing through it.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:17:01.400
The game is Grandia, which is one of the pinnacle, I would say, of Sega Saturn role-playing for

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.320
their RPG series.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:13.640
So it did have quite a few sequels, one of them notably being Grandia 2 that was on Dreamcast

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.880
that I remember bringing up on the show years ago, because I thought it was cool that my

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.880
Japanese save file worked on the US version, because I put it in and I was like, where

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:24.880
am I?

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.960
I don't know what anybody's talking about.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:38.760
So anyway, Grandia has 3D maps with 2D sprite characters, think like Ragnarok I guess, but

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:44.280
it rotates with your movement, it's from an angled third person perspective, and so it'll

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.280
follow with you.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.960
Just a word of warning, the camera works so much better in the Saturn one, you also get

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:55.400
much more of the playfield open than you do with the Playstation one, which is, actually

01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:00.800
the 3D looks better in the Saturn one, which is completely baffling to me, since the Saturn

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:04.560
didn't have that tremendous of a 3D processor.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.640
You also have a compass to show you where you go, you get treasure chests inside.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:17.320
A fun story to it too, you also have skill points that you need to learn your abilities,

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:22.360
and you have a rotational roster for your characters, you can pick different ones to

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.880
have in, there are different types of weapons and classes, like swords, maces, whips, that

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:34.120
sort of thing, and you actually learn your magic as you go through the game, by recovering

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.000
these mana eggs, it's pretty cool.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.440
The combat system though is what I like best, Rob, you played Evolution, didn't you?

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.440
No.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:50.280
I thought you did, well, Evolution is another game art title, but the way that the combat

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:55.560
works in here is that it's on, well you can, it's like in Chrono Trigger, you can see the

01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:01.280
enemies on the screen, if they see you, they'll rush towards you, or you can try to avoid

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:07.520
them and they'll run into you, but then when you're in combat it goes overhead, and it

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:16.720
has, I look at it more of as initiative based, like if you were playing D&D or something,

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:22.240
then everybody has their own sort of speed that their initiative moves at, so you'll

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:27.000
have your slower characters taking longer, your faster ones being faster, and you choose

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.360
your attacks as you're going through, and then when that turn comes up, they'll hit

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.760
and then the enemy will go back and forth, it's pretty, I have to say it's fairly more

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.520
realistic than the turn based style for Final Fantasy games, if you know what I mean.

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.200
And Rob, you're watching it, what do you think?

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.920
It looks very interesting, I've always heard a lot about this game, it's just one of those

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.200
games I just never got around to playing, because there were a lot of games, especially

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:55.400
this was the period when I was in college, so I didn't play a lot of games, that was

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:59.600
kind of the one time in my life when I wasn't as into video games as I was the rest of it,

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.200
but it looks like a lot of fun, and I want to say, a sequel of Grandia's is available

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.040
on GameTap, I want to say, I want to say like Grandia 2, is it on there?

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:11.080
Well, Grandia 2 was a good one, then there was a Grandia 3 and I think a Grandia Extreme,

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:17.360
which I haven't played the latter ones, but nothing to me, I mean, Grandia is probably

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.040
up there in my list, this would actually, I even like this better than Final Fantasy

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:26.240
7, and Final Fantasy 6, if that's an indication of how much I like it.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:31.240
The way I got my Saturn version was very fun, because at the time I got my Saturn version

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:35.700
they were going for about 80 to 100 bucks a piece, I bought one for 15 that said the

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:40.080
discs were damaged, so I was like, I'll just rip them and re-burn them, right?

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:45.040
So this is at Anime Expo, probably the last year I went, and I was going in to watch the

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:49.200
Utena movie, and I ended up just sitting out in the hall waiting for it to be over, and

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:55.880
as I sat and tried to clean the discs, I realized that the discs weren't scratched, they actually

01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:04.680
had stuff on them, so I cleaned off the discs, it looked like hot glue, and cleaned it all

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:08.680
off and lo and behold, I had perfect copies for 15 bucks.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.680
Nice.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.360
Like I said, this did have a Playstation release that is not nearly as good, however, the only

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:20.360
way you can play it in English is on Playstation, and I warn you, it is highly, highly censored,

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.200
especially the part where they go in the bar.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:29.680
So it's really, really good, I say give it a try.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:34.560
Alright, your classic game of the week boys and girls, Grandia, which is a series I know

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:38.680
a lot of people really have a lot of love for, so I'm sure that's going to be a, that's

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.360
not going to be disputed by many as a classic game.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:47.200
Oh, real quick though, I do have the series, it was Grandia 2 and Grandia 3, and then the

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.460
spinoffs were Grandia Digital Museum, which is basically like a bunch of artwork and voice

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:56.440
files and stuff that went with it, Grandia Parallel Trippers, and Grandia Extreme, and

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:00.280
Grandia Online, which I'm going to play Grandia Online.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.280
Sounds like fun.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.520
