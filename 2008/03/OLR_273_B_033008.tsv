0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	23000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this Part B of our podcast.
23000	25000	It is March 30, 2008.
25000	29000	We are live at orangeloungeradio.com.
29000	31000	Some changes coming very soon in our future.
31000	36000	If you haven't heard about them yet, make sure you're listening to both parts of Orange Lounge Radio every week from our podcast feed.
36000	39000	More information is available over at orangeloungeradio.com.
39000	46000	If you missed Part A, you missed us talking about PlayStation stuff and some of the things coming to Xbox Live,
46000	51000	like Darwinian, some Ikaruga, and the Penny Arcade game.
51000	54000	Now we're going to get into some Wii news, and we'll start off with Loki.
54000	57000	And also, if you didn't listen to Part A, then you're a witch!
57000	59000	Yes, you're a witch!
59000	60000	Damn you.
60000	64000	Coming to the Wii, and this is a big shock here.
64000	66000	Rock Band was announced for the Wii.
66000	71000	They're going to be getting the special edition, otherwise known as the one with all the instruments.
71000	79000	And that is coming to retailers June 22 for the small sum of $170.
79000	82000	Yes, that's almost the price of a Wii console.
82000	87000	And, of course, there are a few things you should know about it.
87000	91000	For one, the drum is white.
91000	96000	And number two, it's going to contain five bonus songs.
96000	101000	That's only because there are absolutely no downloads for this.
101000	103000	Wah wah.
103000	111000	Yeah, so, much like the PlayStation 2 version, there are no downloads for at least this version of Rock Band.
111000	113000	So sad.
113000	115000	Let's see what other stuff...
115000	120000	Oh, the instruments are all going to be very similar to the other systems.
120000	124000	You don't need to use your Wii mote in any way with these.
124000	126000	They're all going to be USB.
126000	131000	And it will come with the powered USB hub, much like the Xbox 360 release.
131000	132000	Did you really...
132000	138000	I mean, honestly, people out there, did you really think that Rock Band on the Wii was going to have download content?
138000	142000	I mean, did you really think that because, where would they put it?
142000	143000	Seriously.
143000	150000	The only other thing they could do is already have it on the disc, and then you download little unlock codes, but that would piss people off even more.
150000	152000	Yeah, it would piss people off.
152000	157000	The thing I would, I don't know, maybe download it to SD memory cards.
157000	163000	Really, I think that's what it's going to take, you know, somehow make your own file formats.
163000	169000	Because I know that Nintendo has their stupid block set up for, you know, game saves and stuff like that.
169000	172000	But it doesn't necessarily mean, you know, programs have to use that.
172000	178000	I mean, if you look at it, you know, Smash Brothers has its own save data.
178000	184000	You know, Excite Truck and Endless Ocean use MP3s.
184000	192000	So, who's to say that you couldn't make some sort of like, I don't know, independent file format and have it work only saves to SD memory cards?
192000	201000	Hell, you can make it, like, you purchase it online, download it off your PC to an SD memory card or something like that, and then that's how you play with it.
201000	207000	Because right now, the way they've got their download content set up, well, there is no way to do download content.
207000	209000	Just, Nintendo's that far behind the game.
209000	211000	Dream on, on all that stuff, by the way.
211000	216000	Just dream on.
216000	218000	I'm sorry, I was choking on toast.
218000	222000	You know, honestly, what my honest reaction, though, was when I heard that news about Rock Band being on the Wii?
222000	226000	I actually, I was like, I thought it was already on the Wii.
226000	230000	Because, seriously, Rock Band's on, like, every system, just like Guitar Hero and all that stuff.
230000	233000	I thought Rock Band was already on the Wii.
233000	240000	But I, of course, did not make that my system of choice, because I knew it wouldn't have the download songs, and I knew it wouldn't be probably quite the graphical quality of the other versions.
240000	244000	I can't wait until they shoehorn it onto the DS.
244000	246000	I'm sure that's just a matter of time, huh?
246000	250000	That would be insane. It would have to use Wi-Fi, I think.
250000	253000	You could do the drums with the stylus. Tap, tap, tap, tap.
253000	254000	I guess that would work.
254000	257000	Maybe make use of that Guitar Hero expansion.
257000	258000	Probably not, though.
258000	261000	You would have a separate guitar that wouldn't be compatible with the other one.
261000	263000	Just you wait.
263000	271000	Well, if singing is more your thing, it could be very soon that a SingStar-type clone is coming to the Wii.
271000	273000	It looks like it's called JoySound.
273000	278000	Apparently, Hudson is making this game called JoySound.
278000	282000	It's going to be something that you can actually get on WiiWare.
282000	289000	You'll download this JoySound thing, and you get it from a server that's being exclusively set up for that, whatever that is.
289000	291000	But here's the trick with it.
291000	295000	Instead of having to pay for individual songs, you subscribe to it.
295000	304000	They're hoping to release it this summer in Japan. It's going to have 20,000 songs available at launch, 1,000 more every month.
304000	312000	If they have that, I'm sorry, but that's sad for SingStar, especially when they're touting that they're going to have this huge, long thing.
312000	313000	And Karaoke Revolution.
313000	314000	And Karaoke Revolution.
314000	320000	Well, actually, here's the funny thing. It's Hudson that's putting it up there.
320000	328000	So imagine, if you will, they could do something like this and brand it with Karaoke Revolution, and boom, there you go.
328000	332000	You know, bring that over to the US.
332000	339000	But with 20,000 songs, I can't help but think it's just going to be like MIDI songs.
339000	343000	You know what I mean? The quality of the songs is going to be really crap.
343000	344000	You'd be surprised.
344000	347000	MP3s, I mean, they could do it that way.
347000	349000	I mean, that wouldn't be that hard.
349000	353000	But I don't know.
353000	357000	I actually think it's kind of a neat setup and it's a different way of trying to do things.
357000	359000	Again, it all depends on price.
359000	366000	Because that could be a pretty kick-ass party game if you have all those songs available and they can download relatively quickly.
366000	368000	That might be a pretty big deal.
368000	370000	So we'll see.
370000	374000	I'd be curious to see what that plays out like in Japan and if it's even going to come out over here.
374000	376000	We will find out.
376000	383000	Well, for our friends in the UK, there are three releases for Virtual Console.
383000	391000	Actually, what's pretty cool is there were Commodore 64 releases for the European Virtual Console.
391000	393000	I thought that that would interest Rob.
393000	394000	Absolutely.
394000	400000	One of them is International Karate, which is basically what it sounds like.
400000	403000	It's a karate game on the Commodore 64.
403000	409000	I know a lot of people liked it. It wasn't really my thing, but it was one of their earlier fighting games.
409000	418000	Also to come out was Uridium, which was a Commodore 64 shooter that was a horizontal scroller but was fairly unique from what I understand.
418000	422000	I remember Uridium very vaguely, but I did play that.
422000	424000	You're fighting aliens and stuff.
424000	431000	It apparently has elements from Gradius and Defender and a few others that are on there.
431000	434000	It's actually 500 Wii points.
434000	440000	Before I forget to mention, International Karate is also 500 Wii points.
440000	444000	I'm really curious how those Commodore 64 games are going to translate over on the Wii.
444000	446000	I'm really curious to check that out.
446000	450000	The other game that is out is Cruis'n USA.
450000	455000	It was a Nintendo 64 game for 1,000 Wii points.
455000	464000	It's Cruis'n USA. It probably still controls just as badly and is still just as weird as it was before.
464000	466000	What was it, Cruis'n USA?
466000	470000	I'm trying to remember Cruis'n USA on the Nintendo 64.
470000	472000	I don't remember it was very good.
472000	475000	GS68 says I wouldn't buy Cruis'n USA for even 100 Wii points.
475000	480000	Actually, no, I'm thinking of Rush the Rock.
480000	482000	Rush the Rock was okay.
482000	484000	They had that on the Nintendo 64, and no, that wasn't very good.
484000	488000	Cruis'n USA, no, that probably wasn't very good either.
488000	490000	Cruis'n World was a lot better.
490000	493000	California Speed, not very good either.
493000	498000	In fact, all the games made by Midway that were racing, not very good.
498000	500000	Hydro Thunder. I love Hydro Thunder.
500000	501000	The Thunder games were good.
501000	505000	Hydro Thunder was brilliant, especially on Dreamcast.
505000	508000	I can only play that game in the arcades. I can't play it on console.
508000	510000	No way. We had it on Dreamcast.
510000	511000	No way way.
511000	514000	I'll tell you what, it sucked on most PlayStation games.
514000	517000	It sucked ass on PlayStation.
517000	519000	That's it.
519000	525000	In Japan, you're going to be able to get one of the games that Jamie's been super excited about for a while.
525000	531000	Rondo of Blood, or Dracula X Rondo of Blood is coming to the Japanese Virtual Console.
531000	534000	Yes, that is the Turbo Duo version.
534000	540000	No word on how much it's going to cost you, but hey, that's pretty awesome.
540000	551000	And unfortunately, I don't think we're going to see it come over here because it would need to be localized and no one wants to spend any time on something like that.
551000	556000	But if you can play the Japanese version, awesome!
556000	564000	Well, all the cutscenes had text on them. All they'd have to do is translate the text and not worry about the dialogue.
564000	571000	Well, that's still effort, and you remember they don't want to put effort into these games.
571000	576000	RawstealUT in chat points out the game is already localized, PSP version.
576000	577000	That is true.
577000	582000	It is true, and so that wouldn't be that hard, but once again, it takes a little bit of effort to change all the text.
582000	586000	Well, isn't the PSP version all graphed up, too? It's all super graphics now?
586000	588000	But they have the original one on there, too?
588000	589000	Yes, they do.
589000	590000	Oh, okay.
590000	591000	Do they?
591000	593000	I don't know.
593000	597000	But I think the original one, wasn't it Dracula X?
597000	600000	I mean, it's not the new Rondo or the...
600000	606000	Yeah, while these guys get Dracula X Rondo of Blood, you know what we'll get on US Virtual Console?
606000	610000	This stupid, crappy, poo version.
610000	613000	No, it came out over here as Dracula X on Super Nintendo.
613000	616000	I thought it was our Castlevania V.
616000	617000	No, it was...
617000	622000	Because the Dracula X series doesn't necessarily fall in with the actual Castlevania games.
622000	623000	Only there was a Castlevania V.
623000	625000	No, there was a Castlevania V, I swear to God.
625000	630000	We did get a Castlevania V, but it wasn't Dracula X.
630000	636000	Castlevania V, in fact, I do believe it was re-released with the Castlevania Chronicles.
636000	642000	But I'm fairly positive that it was not Dracula X.
642000	648000	Then you're right, I must be crazy. I could have sworn it was Castlevania V we got here.
648000	649000	Huh.
649000	652000	Because they were Super Castlevania IV and I don't remember one after that.
652000	655000	I think Castlevania V came out on PlayStation, if I'm remembering right.
659000	660000	Sorry.
660000	664000	No, Castlevania 64 was the next action.
664000	666000	I'm just crazy, it's fine.
666000	668000	Castlevania 64 does not exist.
668000	670000	It's not worth losing sleep over.
670000	672000	It does not exist to you? It's dead to you?
672000	673000	Dead to me.
673000	680000	And to Dark Tetsuya, technically Dracula XX was Nocturne in the Moonlight, which we got over here as Symphony of the Night.
682000	689000	Alright, well, some other systems games are making its way to the Virtual Console on the Nintendo Wii very soon.
689000	691000	It's the Sega Master System.
691000	694000	And we mentioned this a couple shows ago, but now it is official.
694000	700000	They are making their way to the North American Virtual Console and they're going to cost 400 points a game.
700000	704000	So it makes it the cheapest system of any of them out there.
704000	705000	There's only going to be four bucks a game.
705000	707000	The NES games are five bucks a pop.
707000	712000	Two of the first games that are going to be coming out that should be out soon, that probably means any week now,
712000	715000	Wonder Boy and Fantasy Zone are going to be the first two that come out.
715000	718000	Fantasy Zone, of course, was one of the classic games of the week.
718000	719000	That's right.
719000	720000	Well, Fantasy Zone is a good game, too.
720000	729000	I mean, I don't know if the Sega Master System port of it is my favorite, but, you know, it is, for four bucks, probably not a bad deal.
729000	734000	So, we'll see what other types of Sega Master System games show up very soon.
734000	736000	I need to correct myself.
736000	738000	Symphony of the Night was X2.
738000	742000	XX was the Super Nintendo released in Japan.
742000	744000	Too confusing.
744000	748000	Damn them for releasing, like, completely different games over here in the US than they did over there.
748000	749000	You know what I mean?
749000	750000	Damn them.
750000	751000	Damn the man.
751000	753000	They just should have brought it out over here.
753000	754000	It was so...
754000	755000	Well, I've had it on this show before.
755000	758000	We hooked it up through the old setup.
758000	759000	Oh, very few people will remember that.
759000	760000	That was years ago.
760000	762000	And did screen captures and everything through the webcam.
762000	766000	And it was the whole German intro and everything.
766000	770000	But anyway, I like Fantasy Zone, by the way.
770000	778000	So, another wonderful, wonderful game is going to be remade for WiiWare.
778000	779000	That's pretty cool.
779000	788000	And that is going to be one of the best pinball simulating games ever is Alien Crush.
788000	795000	And you can actually download Alien Crush right now and play it on Virtual Console.
795000	799000	But it's really, really, really happy.
799000	803000	So far, there's only, of course, note for it being out in Japan.
803000	804000	But we could get it.
804000	806000	I really hope that we do.
806000	809000	Hopefully Hudson loves us.
809000	815000	Although, honestly, I would prefer to have Devil's Crush myself.
815000	816000	What happens to...
816000	821000	Because I have the original Alien Crush, so I guess I'm just going to have to have two.
821000	828000	What I'm understanding from this screen capture I'm seeing on here is that instead of the top-down view,
828000	832000	you actually have a slightly more diagonal overhead.
832000	837000	Kind of like more traditional, or I shouldn't say more traditional, more newer.
837000	839000	You know what I mean?
839000	841000	Shut up.
841000	846000	The current types of pinball games look like this.
846000	849000	Like an actual table.
849000	852000	Yeah, it's more of an actual table layout.
852000	855000	But Alien Crush is still pretty sexy.
855000	857000	Extra fruity, happy to know that.
857000	859000	He played a whole crap load of Alien Crush.
859000	862000	Oh my god, I think he played that game for an entire day once.
862000	869000	And I still meant to bring over my Turbo Duo so he could play Devil's Crush at the time, but now it's out.
869000	870000	Yeah.
870000	872000	And now he's not my roommate anymore, so...
872000	873000	Tear.
873000	878000	Maybe he'll get a Wii at some point, though, and buy the game to relive those memories all over again.
878000	879000	We'll see.
879000	887000	Fortunately, one thing he's not going to have made available to him is one of the brand new features to Club Nintendo.
887000	891000	That is a memory card that you can get, an SD memory card.
891000	896000	128 megs worth of music from different Nintendo games.
896000	899000	And some of the songs that they have on there, of course.
899000	906000	Songs from Super Mario Sunshine, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Catch Touch Yoshi.
906000	908000	That's kind of a weird name.
908000	916000	Nintendogs, Mario Kart Double Dash, Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker, Pikmin 2, and Super Mario Brothers.
916000	922000	And, of course, Club Nintendo is exclusively Japanese, and they get all sorts of cool stuff,
922000	928000	including, you know, what is it, classic controllers that look like Super Famicom controllers,
928000	936000	and DS games for the Game & Watch stuff, and that stupid Tingle balloon fight game.
936000	938000	So this is an official Nintendo product.
938000	939000	Yes.
939000	943000	Yet we know Nintendo kind of hates the SD card, so this thing is so weird to me.
943000	944000	I wouldn't say they hate the SD card.
944000	946000	I mean, they put damn SD...
946000	948000	But they just use it for the weirdest stuff, you know what I mean?
948000	953000	Like, the most obvious things, like extra storage, they don't use it for, but this...
953000	957000	I mean, like, what would you really use this on?
957000	958000	Like, custom songs?
958000	960000	So you can play these songs in Excite Truck.
960000	962000	Whoopee!
962000	963000	How many people remember Excite Truck?
963000	964000	You and who else?
964000	965000	Me!
965000	966000	And who else?
966000	967000	Nelly!
967000	968000	Exether.
968000	969000	Kate, you, your wife, and who else?
969000	970000	Exether.
970000	971000	Fine.
971000	977000	Hey, I can't help it if Excite Truck is the greatest racing game on the Wii ever.
977000	979000	Until Excite Truck 2 comes out.
979000	981000	Please, Nintendo.
981000	983000	Sooner than later.
983000	989000	Alright, well guess what kind of story I've got for you guys right now.
989000	997000	That's right, when you hear that music, you know something really tragic has happened.
997000	1001000	And that is that another person has been killed over video games.
1001000	1004000	Or at least that's what the media wants you to believe.
1004000	1014000	A 15-year-old boy was killed by his 18-year-old friend, William Suarez, because he refused
1014000	1017000	to hand over the video game he was playing.
1017000	1020000	So, uh, what did Suarez do?
1020000	1024000	He whipped out a.32 caliber Smith and Wesson from his waistband.
1024000	1027000	Not Mommy and Daddy's closet, not under the bed.
1027000	1034000	He whipped it out from his waistband and shot his 15-year-old friend in the head.
1034000	1037000	What is this world coming to?
1037000	1042000	The killer is 18 years old.
1042000	1047000	He's been charged with manslaughter, illegal possession of a firearm, assault with a dangerous
1047000	1050000	weapon, and discharging a firearm within.500 feet of the dwelling.
1050000	1051000	Why manslaughter?
1051000	1055000	I mean, I would think murder, if anything, because he intended to kill him.
1055000	1060000	How about when you think, oh, a bullet wound to the head, that'll scare him.
1060000	1062000	Just give him the chair.
1062000	1065000	Just give him the chair already.
1065000	1071000	A quote from the article, witnesses told authorities that Suarez then put the gun down on the kitchen
1071000	1075000	counter and began saying, this just didn't happen.
1075000	1079000	So, kind of like he went crazy or something, I don't know.
1079000	1081000	Now, here's the question.
1081000	1084000	Did video games really have anything to do with this?
1084000	1085000	No.
1085000	1086000	Not really.
1086000	1087000	No.
1087000	1091000	But yet, here are the headlines that are coming out.
1091000	1092000	Family.
1092000	1095000	Game led to teen's murder.
1095000	1098000	Video game linked to fatal shooting in Brockton.
1098000	1103000	More like, Psycho killed kid.
1103000	1105000	End of story.
1105000	1106000	It's sad.
1106000	1110000	It would be the same thing as if he had a Furby a few years ago.
1110000	1114000	Or a Tickle Me Elmo or whatever the fuck it was called.
1114000	1116000	You know what they need to do to this kid?
1116000	1118000	They need to burn him.
1118000	1120000	Because he's a witch!
1120000	1125000	No, he's much, much worse than that.
1125000	1127000	Being a witch is not bad.
1127000	1133000	Being a psycho murderer is.
1133000	1144000	You see, I thought he had two lives, and so that's why I didn't know he would be dead forever.
1144000	1150000	Thank you news media, by the way, for blowing this story completely out of proportion.
1150000	1153000	I mean, it's sad, and it's fucked up, and it shouldn't have happened.
1153000	1155000	Way to take the high road.
1155000	1159000	But was it the video game's fault, or was it because the kid was a loon?
1159000	1161000	What video game was it?
1161000	1164000	It doesn't even say. Does it matter?
1164000	1166000	Does it really matter?
1166000	1170000	I mean, I guess if it was Grand Theft Auto or something, you'd go, oh yeah, another one of those.
1170000	1175000	But if it was something like Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen go shopping, or Imagine Babies or something,
1175000	1178000	then that would be kind of interesting.
1178000	1180000	Bitch, come back for Imagine Babies.
1180000	1182000	Alright.
1182000	1185000	It's not funny. I'm not laughing at that, I swear.
1185000	1187000	Alright. No, it really isn't funny.
1187000	1188000	You are too.
1188000	1192000	It's not funny. I don't know.
1192000	1194000	It's sick.
1194000	1196000	And it makes me angsty.
1196000	1200000	You know, after those types of stories, you know this part of the show is coming up.
1200000	1202000	The F years of the week.
1202000	1218000	This is fucked up.
1218000	1220000	Is that an F you to the ferret?
1220000	1224000	No, the ferret had to get a few things out from being stuck in your closet for how long.
1224000	1232000	Um, F you to, um, well I don't really want to say F you to California Burger, because really all I wanted was the pastrami.
1232000	1235000	But they didn't give me the burger that was supposed to go with the pastrami.
1235000	1238000	And I feel deprived of meat.
1238000	1248000	So, F you to that, and um, F you to my lack of fundage for the present.
1248000	1251000	A big F you poopy ball to that.
1251000	1252000	F you to money.
1252000	1255000	Well, I mean, money is just F you to lack of money.
1255000	1256000	Yeah.
1256000	1257000	Logan.
1257000	1270000	F you to people who drive big trucks that can't figure out where in the lane they're supposed to be because, you know, for some reason when people need to make a left turn, they start heading towards the right and cutting into my lane and then they make their left turn because their truck is too big.
1270000	1275000	It's not my fault you bought a big truck. Doesn't mean you have to run me off the road.
1275000	1289000	My F you of the week goes to the fact that I'm about to enter my fourth week of having pains that float around my abdomen, my back, my stomach, and no one knows what's wrong with me still.
1289000	1292000	I had a blood test on Tuesday. I'm still waiting on the results.
1292000	1294000	I'm going for alien chest popper.
1294000	1296000	God, I hope not.
1296000	1297000	Although I guess that would be kind of cool.
1297000	1301000	I mean, if I'm going to go, let's go out with a bang like that and why not, huh?
1301000	1304000	But it's very frustrating.
1304000	1307000	I'm really frustrated with the way my doctor is handling things.
1307000	1308000	What's that?
1308000	1309000	Did you have the special?
1309000	1310000	No, I did not have the special.
1310000	1316000	All right, let's move back into some gaming news.
1316000	1320000	Jamie, please take us away from Angstville.
1320000	1325000	Well, this might still make people angsty.
1325000	1326000	Sorry, but I didn't make it.
1326000	1339000	GameStop is not going to be carrying Game Boy and Game Boy Color stuff, games, systems, crap that goes with it, hoping to have it all wiped out by the end of April.
1339000	1341000	I didn't know they were still carrying Game Boy.
1341000	1345000	Yeah, I know. I'm not angsty about it. I'm surprised they still got it.
1345000	1348000	Well, you can always go to Game Crazy for that stuff.
1348000	1352000	Or Plain Trade or any other mom and pops out there.
1352000	1356000	Or buy yourself a freaking Game Boy Advance and get with the times already. Jesus.
1356000	1361000	But there were some really, really good games that were old Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.
1361000	1365000	But those old games will work on Game Boy Advance.
1365000	1371000	They will, but if they're not going to be selling the games, you have to go to the little trader places.
1371000	1373000	All right, fair enough.
1373000	1377000	I do have to admit, one of the cutest Game Boys I ever had, I don't know why I gave it to my sister.
1377000	1379000	That was the stupidest thing I ever did.
1379000	1385000	But I had a Game Boy Color that when you turned it on, it had a little Pikachu around the power thing.
1385000	1388000	And so it looked like his cheeks lit up because the power was on.
1388000	1391000	Maybe it was Pichu, not Pikachu, but you know what I mean.
1391000	1395000	I had a pink Game Boy Advance.
1395000	1396000	How girly.
1396000	1399000	And this is me who isn't like the uber girly girl.
1399000	1401000	I just wanted a pink one.
1401000	1403000	I think I wanted them because they were hard to get.
1403000	1407000	Mine was clear and has no backlight.
1407000	1410000	Well, we put a backlight in mine.
1410000	1417000	I had to use those stupid little reading light things that would clip to the top so you could actually see the screen.
1417000	1418000	Ah, Nintendo.
1418000	1422000	I had a friend put an afterburner in mine.
1422000	1426000	I think he was just happy about having a chance to take apart something technological.
1426000	1436000	Well, you may not be able to get Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but one game you will be able to get probably pretty soon is the sequel to 50 Cent Bulletproof.
1436000	1439000	Yes, it's a brand new game.
1439000	1444000	50 Cent to Blood in the Sand.
1444000	1447000	And my god is it shit.
1447000	1451000	It's basically, if I remember the premise of it correct,
1451000	1460000	Fiddy goes to the Middle East to perform for somebody and the promoter doesn't have the money to pay him.
1460000	1465000	So instead of paying him money, he pays him in a diamond encrusted skull.
1465000	1469000	Which gets stolen by, I can only assume, terrorists.
1469000	1473000	And then it's up to Fiddy to get the skull back.
1473000	1476000	If that's not a more ridiculous plot, I don't know.
1476000	1477000	But here's the funny thing though.
1477000	1484000	I kind of think that's pretty neat because let's just go the completely ridiculous route with the whole entire game.
1484000	1486000	I mean, that's the way it should be.
1486000	1493000	Just completely take the storyline just to unbelievable like, you know, where he has to go in a space shuttle somewhere to save the moon or something.
1493000	1497000	Dark Tetsuya says, please tell me this is an early April Fool's Day joke.
1497000	1498000	I'm afraid it's not.
1498000	1501000	I almost kind of want to agree.
1501000	1502000	I don't know though.
1502000	1509000	You do bring up an interesting point, Loki, is that if it's almost like self-parody or something, it's actually kind of funny.
1509000	1510000	But I don't think it is.
1510000	1515000	I think he's trying to make it out like, dude, it's 50 Cent fighting terrorists.
1515000	1517000	How much more American do you need?
1517000	1520000	I mean, he shits red, white, and blue.
1520000	1522000	That's how American it is.
1522000	1525000	It's like, you know, no more taking on gang bangers.
1525000	1529000	It's now time to take on terrorists.
1529000	1531000	Hurrah.
1531000	1533000	Yeah, I don't know.
1533000	1536000	And people will buy it.
1536000	1546000	I mean, the first thing I thought of when I heard there was a sequel to this game is I thought, you mean Bulletproof 1 sold enough copies to necessitate this?
1546000	1549000	What the hell?
1549000	1558000	Yeah, I just wanted to make sure I have the correct name for all this stuff.
1558000	1566000	I am pretty positive that was the actual plot to this.
1566000	1572000	I wonder if this is trying to be like, you know how some movies are so bad they're actually kind of good, like Showgirls?
1572000	1574000	This is going to be like the Showgirls of video gaming.
1574000	1575000	It's so bad, it's pretty funny.
1575000	1576000	Hey, Rob.
1576000	1577000	What?
1577000	1579000	You are a whore.
1579000	1581000	You made me sit down and watch that movie and I love it.
1581000	1583000	Because it's awesome.
1583000	1590000	I guess Bulletproof sold, it was a multi-million dollar, or multi-million copies selling game.
1590000	1593000	I don't remember it selling more than one.
1593000	1595000	Who's buying it?
1595000	1596000	I don't know.
1596000	1601000	Blend of the Sand is something more exotic, more Hollywood blockbuster.
1601000	1609000	This game sets 50's character against a cabal of international gangsters on a far flung bullet ridden adventure.
1609000	1615000	They say it's inspired by three kings meets lock stock and two smoking barrels.
1615000	1617000	It's definitely a crime story.
1617000	1624000	The developer credited 50 with pushing the game's creators to consider novel locations
1624000	1635000	and said that MC played a big part in crafting the game's still secret story.
1635000	1636000	I don't know.
1636000	1644000	And I guess the game will run on the Unreal 3 engine because every other fucking game on the face of the earth runs on the Unreal 3 engine.
1644000	1654000	And will allow you to have co-op, drop in, drop out of co-op play, and other people will be able to be one of the other three members of the G unit.
1654000	1658000	Tony Yao, Wu Kid, and Lloyd Banks.
1658000	1661000	That is way too many frills for a game like this.
1661000	1663000	What in the hell?
1663000	1664000	I don't know.
1664000	1667000	It's interesting.
1667000	1674000	Qualtippo in chat says, let us not forget that Cars was one of, if not the best selling game of 2006.
1674000	1681000	You know, we have to remember folks that are really into gaming and the hobbyists like we are and probably the folks listening to this program,
1681000	1686000	we're not often times the largest market share of who's buying these games.
1686000	1689000	There's not a lot of games out there for the urban market.
1689000	1693000	And stuff like this does do really well, actually.
1693000	1695000	So, it's just crazy.
1695000	1696000	Even this?
1696000	1697000	Even this?
1697000	1698000	This?
1698000	1699000	But here's the thing.
1699000	1705000	It sounds like they're actually putting some effort into the game because, I mean, the first one was pretty cinematic.
1705000	1707000	It was just kind of retarded.
1707000	1712000	But this one, being that it's on the Unreal 3 engine, stuff like that, I mean, I don't know.
1712000	1713000	I have to see how it looks.
1713000	1715000	But yeah, the whole thing sounds ridiculous.
1715000	1716000	All right.
1716000	1718000	We'll see.
1718000	1722000	Well, one thing we won't be seeing much more of for sure.
1722000	1730000	Here's the thing. Do you remember last week we talked about that Target was selling these indie gaming shirts and that they actually came with the game on the shirt?
1730000	1732000	They already got pulled from shelves.
1732000	1733000	Really?
1733000	1734000	Yep.
1734000	1738000	They already have been pulled from shelves because unfortunately they just weren't selling.
1738000	1739000	What?
1739000	1740000	They gave it like a week.
1740000	1741000	It's not working out.
1741000	1744000	I guess they measure that stuff day by day.
1744000	1746000	The local Target buyers have those actually.
1746000	1747000	Really?
1747000	1748000	Yeah.
1748000	1749000	The one birdcage.
1749000	1754000	Unfortunately, they were selling less than what Target thought was good enough to keep it on the store.
1754000	1761000	The distributors are going to try, again though, they're going to try Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic as the months will go on.
1761000	1762000	So who knows?
1762000	1764000	But I imagine the shirts will be more expensive.
1764000	1766000	They should try GameStop.
1766000	1769000	I mean, I know I hate to push GameStop, but I mean...
1769000	1771000	Or other game box stores.
1771000	1772000	Yeah, Gaming Chains.
1772000	1773000	That would be the perfect...
1773000	1780000	Or, I don't know, allow them to be purchased on their website from independent retailers out there.
1780000	1782000	That would be the way to do it, I would think.
1782000	1783000	All right.
1783000	1786000	Well, hey, it's time for that part of the show where we hear back from you guys.
1786000	1791000	One of many, because of course we have the chat, we have the Skype line, but we also have the mailbag.
1791000	1799000	And every week we like to read through the emails and answer those of you guys that are brave enough to write us at mailbag at orangeloungeloungeradio.com.
1799000	1805000	DarkStalker is going to jump in the mailbag and pull out a few of her favorite emails for us to hear this week.
1805000	1808000	But as I understand, I don't think there were a whole lot of emails this week.
1808000	1809000	No, only a few.
1809000	1810000	Depressing.
1810000	1813000	Wow, hey, we got some spam in the interim as well.
1813000	1814000	Hooray.
1814000	1815000	And another couple of emails.
1815000	1820000	So actually I might just be generous and read the two new ones that came in as well.
1820000	1823000	So starting off, this one says,
1823000	1831000	Hi, all. First, sorry for not contacting you before, but I have been listening to your show via iTunes podcasts for about 18 months.
1831000	1832000	Big fan of DarkSakura.
1832000	1833000	Oh, thank you.
1833000	1835000	And wouldn't like to miss hearing her every week.
1835000	1837000	Aww, thank you.
1837000	1852000	So on that note, have you ever looked into using, I guess it's ustream.tv, stickam.com with chat, plus storage for shows and have been used by Leah Laporte for TWITV?
1852000	1854000	This week in tech.
1854000	1855000	Yeah, okay.
1855000	1862000	Well, basically it lists a whole bunch of other things, but as we've announced earlier in the show, we've got our plan.
1862000	1867000	Yes, and ustream.tv actually, we actually have a channel on ustream.tv.
1867000	1868000	We just never used it.
1868000	1871000	We actually, we were originally going to go with ustream.tv.
1871000	1874000	We made a last minute decision to switch to Justin.tv.
1874000	1877000	That was after the operator 11 fallout, because I remember we were using them for a little while.
1877000	1881000	So I'd actually created the ustream.tv account with the intention of going over there.
1881000	1884000	But I don't know, there was something about Justin.tv I just liked a little better.
1884000	1891000	Oh, I think I, I like the way you could, that fans could go in and cut out the highlight clips that you could upload things to YouTube and import things from YouTube.
1891000	1894000	I felt Justin.tv had a little more of the functionality.
1894000	1899000	And ustream, ustream seemed a little too big for me.
1899000	1900000	You know what I mean?
1900000	1901000	This is a lot more interactive, I think.
1901000	1903000	Yeah, I like Justin.tv a little more.
1903000	1904000	It seemed a little more homely.
1904000	1906000	Yeah, it's a little more cozy.
1906000	1907000	I like that.
1907000	1912000	Well, just to continue with the email, also talkshoe.com does live audio broadcast with chat room.
1912000	1915000	But it needs to be downloaded first order to use live server.
1915000	1920000	And you can also record the shows as you do them, which are available in the show archive.
1920000	1921000	I hope that helps.
1921000	1923000	If not, sorry and hope you find a solution soon.
1923000	1925000	All the best, Steve in the UK.
1925000	1928000	Well, hopefully you'll be pleased with the earlier news about our solution.
1928000	1929000	We're pretty excited about it.
1929000	1930000	Voltron!
1930000	1933000	Which is pretty much sort of what we had kind of thought already.
1933000	1934000	Mm-hmm.
1934000	1937000	Next email.
1937000	1939000	Hello, gentlemen and lady.
1939000	1941000	I just watched Dead Fantasy II.
1941000	1943000	I want you guys...
1943000	1945000	I know you guys have seen the first one.
1945000	1947000	It's nothing compared to the second.
1947000	1950000	I just think that it's amazing that someone could do this in their spare time.
1950000	1953000	I've looked at it several times now and can't help but wonder what Dark Soccer thought.
1953000	1955000	Well, I haven't seen it yet.
1955000	1958000	I know she loves her fighting games in Final Fantasy.
1958000	1960000	Monty Om, I guess that's how it's pronounced,
1960000	1963000	has said that there are at least five more in the series.
1963000	1966000	I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet,
1966000	1967000	but I've got a few questions.
1967000	1971000	With the latest surprising characters, who do you think might make an appearance next?
1971000	1973000	And finally, which side will win in the end?
1973000	1977000	Seems the Final Fantasy team has an unfair advantage by using both weapons and magic.
1977000	1979000	I'll be surprised if they win, though.
1979000	1983000	Lastly, I don't have the time to listen to the show live,
1983000	1985000	but I've always downloaded the podcast.
1985000	1989000	It seems that there are always regular live listeners to support the show.
1989000	1991000	If you guys can find a suitable alternative to Live 365,
1991000	1993000	then how about a fundraiser?
1993000	1995000	I know it sounds a bit corny,
1995000	1997000	but I've come to like the show very much
1997000	2001000	and would hate to see any changes that would cripple the community that has grown around it.
2005000	2008000	I'd be more than willing to donate money to keep the show going,
2008000	2010000	and I'm sure most of the live listeners would as well.
2010000	2012000	Thanks for getting me through a rough day.
2012000	2013000	This is from Recimo.
2013000	2017000	And to be honest, we disagree with what Live 365 is doing,
2017000	2022000	and it's more or less the point that we don't want to support what they're doing,
2022000	2025000	no matter if we can afford it or not, right?
2025000	2027000	Whoa, the FU music came in there. Sorry about that.
2027000	2029000	I was like, where the hell is that music going?
2029000	2031000	Yeah, it's appropriate, so it's all right.
2031000	2034000	Again, thank you for the wonderful offer,
2034000	2038000	but we have another plan that we think will help actually grow our community a little bit.
2038000	2042000	By the way, Jamie, here's a little sneak peek of Dead Fantasy II,
2042000	2044000	which shows the...
2044000	2047000	It's basically, I did watch some of it.
2047000	2053000	I mean, it's just one giant fanboy orgasm in video form.
2053000	2055000	It's what it is for all.
2055000	2061000	It's just special effect after special effect after chicks beating the crap out of each other,
2061000	2064000	explosions, falling bricks.
2064000	2069000	I mean, biting down a giant spike TV should just show this all day long, honestly.
2069000	2070000	I think I'm going to watch that one again.
2070000	2074000	People would be happy.
2074000	2076000	I see dead or alive people.
2076000	2078000	Yeah, well, it's dead or alive.
2078000	2083000	It's just one giant fanboy orgasm.
2083000	2084000	It's crazy.
2084000	2086000	Riku just got thrown in that clip there.
2086000	2087000	That's lovely.
2087000	2088000	Anyway, sorry, I know that makes for a horrible radio,
2088000	2090000	but I wanted to show Jamie a little clip of that.
2090000	2093000	That's completely awesome.
2093000	2098000	You got an email from Hero Antagonist, which was a link,
2098000	2102000	and it said, this seemed like something you'd want to see if you haven't already.
2102000	2105000	It's like a bizarre twist between DDR Beatmania and a slot machine,
2105000	2107000	which we've covered earlier.
2107000	2109000	Oh, well, there you have it then.
2109000	2111000	The Beatmania Pachi slot.
2111000	2113000	So that was pretty cool.
2113000	2117000	Also, we got an email from GS68.
2117000	2119000	It says, hey, OLR crew.
2119000	2123000	I'm sure you'll recall at least twice getting emails from a blind gamer named Ranma from India.
2123000	2127000	I have something for him, that is, if he's still listening to the show.
2127000	2132000	I'm not sure if you've seen this yet, but on YouTube there's a blind gamer who goes by the nick
2132000	2137000	Geniuses Corruption, who has played through Zelda Ocarina of Time,
2137000	2140000	Zelda Twilight Princess, and Castlevania Circle of the Moon,
2140000	2142000	and posted videos of his conquests.
2142000	2143000	You can see his page.
2143000	2148000	It's, again, Geniuses Corruption, Geniuses being plural.
2148000	2154000	Given that he has proven he is blind through the front page video of him beating a boss blindfolded,
2154000	2156000	it just goes to show that even blind gamers can play video games.
2156000	2158000	To Ranma of India, you are not alone.
2158000	2163000	There are other gamers out there who are born blind and they play video games, so can you.
2163000	2165000	That's from GS68.
2165000	2167000	I watched it. It was actually pretty cool.
2167000	2172000	The game he was playing in, oh crap, I lost the link.
2172000	2175000	I closed it, sorry.
2175000	2180000	But he was playing through a GameCube game and doing fairly decently.
2180000	2188000	Cheeseburger sent us a giant ASCII finger that says to Live 365.
2188000	2190000	Thank you, Cheeseburger.
2190000	2193000	That was very nice ASCII art. I was very impressed.
2193000	2197000	J-Rod emailed one of the two that we got recently.
2197000	2200000	Hi, OLR crew. Love the show. Keep up the awesome job.
2200000	2204000	What I was writing about was concerning deeper characters and themes in video games
2204000	2209000	and how long do you think it will be before we actually start seeing this type of stuff in games.
2209000	2215000	We were recently seeing a much greater character portrayal in writing with emotions like love with games like Mass Effect and others.
2215000	2220000	I would like to see deep and mature storylines involving other things and emotions that are
2220000	2227000	quote, too hot for video games to deal with like racism, sexism, homosexuality, and various other things.
2227000	2234000	American History X and Schindler's List are very powerful, well done films that deal with very mature subjects and are in good taste.
2234000	2239000	It seems like companies such as Rockstar putting out games like Manhunt are actually setting us backwards
2239000	2244000	when it comes to being taken seriously compared to other forms of entertainment like movies and books
2244000	2249000	and that mature games that deal with big issues aren't going to happen anytime soon.
2249000	2253000	Am I thinking too negatively about this? What do you guys think?
2253000	2256000	Would you like to play games that deal with these themes in a tasteful way?
2256000	2262000	This email is sponsored by Olive Garden, home of the Never Ending Salads and Breadsticks.
2262000	2267000	Of course. That's a really good thought.
2267000	2269000	Japanese games have been doing it for a while.
2269000	2272000	I would love to play these types of games. I think it would be a lot of fun.
2272000	2279000	Unfortunately, you only really see it in the occasional role playing game that has the more mature themes, but I think it would be fun.
2279000	2282000	I just don't think they'd sell well is the unfortunate thing.
2282000	2290000	In Hollywood, you can make a big budget movie, lots of special effects and explosions.
2290000	2294000	You can make a big budget movie or you can make a small budget movie that cost a lot less to make.
2294000	2302000	Usually, those types of movies that address those themes are the small budget movies, your Oscar-winning types of movies.
2302000	2306000	Those things are usually the small little independent stuff.
2306000	2311000	While in the gaming world, you have the big budget stuff and the small budget stuff,
2311000	2317000	the small budget stuff usually tends to be indie stuff, that A, doesn't get a lot of exposure,
2317000	2321160	And B, usually the indie stuff is innovating on different types of gameplay, not necessarily
2321160	2325600	new themes in game formats that we've already seen, if that makes sense.
2325600	2330520	Because when you talk about exploring those types of themes, well, you can't really do
2330520	2333920	a lot of that in a puzzle game.
2333920	2337600	You're talking about types of games that are really involved with story, so that's basically
2337600	2339680	RPG and those types of games.
2339680	2347740	You don't see a lot of really polished indie efforts in those realms, if that makes sense.
2347740	2350600	So I think that's why you're right, it's going to be a long time, unfortunately, before we
2350600	2351680	see something like this.
2351680	2354920	And what it's going to take is it's going to take video games getting even bigger and
2354920	2361240	bigger so that more and more money and there's more budgets for different types of experiments
2361240	2362480	and try things.
2362480	2366600	But I think it would be great to have some of those things you mentioned.
2366600	2374840	Well, like I said, quite a few games have come out overseas that dealt with deeper topics,
2374840	2379280	but we won't get them over here.
2379280	2383040	Last email from Mr. D.
2383040	2385720	Big wave from across the pond to Sky Dark Sakura and Loki.
2385720	2390360	I'm a UK listener who occasionally listens live and am as I write this.
2390360	2391360	Oh, cool.
2391360	2392360	Hi.
2392360	2396520	Yeah, I must be crazy since the show starts about 1 to 2 a.m. here, but I often find my
2396520	2400600	self not getting a lot of sleep during the early hours of Monday morning due to having
2400600	2401960	frequent uni deadlines.
2401960	2403440	Oh, I'm sorry.
2403440	2405440	Your show keeps me going, so thanks.
2405440	2410840	Anyway, Dark Sakura's talk of grandia reminded me of something I've been thinking about previously,
2410840	2412800	memorable RPG moments.
2412800	2413800	My memory of-
2413800	2415400	Damn, that was fast.
2415400	2416400	Yeah.
2416400	2418840	You just brought up grandia like an hour ago.
2418840	2420880	That's instant gratification there, you go.
2420880	2421880	All right, sorry.
2421880	2426440	My memory of grandia is really patchy and I found the crossing of the wall that makes,
2426440	2429840	that marks the end of the world to be very memorable.
2429840	2432600	What are your most memorable RPG scenes?
2432600	2436360	To stop right there, that's one of them.
2436360	2442400	Actually, the whole ghost ship part in grandia I thought was really, really just awesome.
2442400	2446240	I hate to be cliche, but come on, the whole-
2446240	2447240	Opera.
2447240	2453640	Well, the opera in six, but the you know who dies in Final Fantasy VII was really emotional
2453640	2455440	and a really big step in games at that time.
2455440	2457920	I hate to be cliche, but that really is the one that comes to mind.
2457920	2459800	It was really emotional for me too, Rob.
2459800	2460800	You emotional overjoyed.
2460800	2467440	I cheered so loudly and I was like, yes, and I still to this day have my card with the
2467440	2473560	stupid hoe bag's death saved on it because I laughed my ass off and I spend the whole
2473560	2479280	time screaming at Jenova so I can get to that part and watch the death.
2479280	2483080	I'll give an answer that maybe the guy wasn't looking for, but I'll kind of take it in a
2483080	2484080	different direction.
2484080	2487240	I'm going to say games like World of Warcraft.
2487240	2490680	When you do things with your guild, like for instance, I have a guild of mostly people
2490680	2492040	I know offline.
2492040	2495640	We have maybe a handful of OLR listeners in there, but not a few, even though I've plugged
2495640	2496640	it like a million times.
2496640	2498040	I guess you all don't want to play WoW with us.
2498040	2499040	That's fine.
2499040	2500040	See if I care.
2500040	2504120	But no, we have this guild on there and we're currently raiding Karazhan because we finally
2504120	2507860	have enough people who are level 70 to start doing some of the 10-man raids.
2507860	2513000	And I'll tell you what, when we finally get the strategy down to beat one of the bosses
2513000	2517600	such as Maiden of Virtue was one of those bosses where the first couple times we went
2517600	2520000	in there and did it, oh my God, she was so tough.
2520000	2523560	But then when we were finally able to overcome that and beat her, we were so happy and so
2523560	2526620	excited because we really accomplished something.
2526620	2529160	Not like, oh my gosh, I'm going to run out naked through the streets.
2529160	2530160	I'm so happy.
2530160	2534000	But there definitely is that emotion of, hey, look, we accomplished this together.
2534000	2536000	That's pretty rad.
2536000	2540380	Yeah, I guess.
2540380	2541380	I don't know.
2541380	2547560	It's a different type of answer, you know, not necessarily a scripted thing, but working
2547560	2548920	together towards a common goal.
2548920	2553840	I still laughed my ass off in Final Fantasy VII, by the way.
2553840	2554840	Do you?
2554840	2555840	I laughed.
2555840	2556840	Nice.
2556840	2561200	To continue with the email, personally, mine are the bridge battle in Shining Force, escaping
2561200	2566820	Midgar in Final Fantasy VII, and the aforementioned wall at the end of the world in Grandia.
2566820	2570880	The Shining Force thing probably doesn't seem all that interesting to most people, but that
2570880	2577360	was my first RPG at age 6 in 1993, oh, I feel old, so it's got a special place in my heart.
2577360	2581400	Speaking of sentimental games, it'd also be cool to know what games are particularly special
2581400	2582780	to you, and why.
2582780	2585480	Keep up the great show, Mr. D.
2585480	2593240	As far as games that are special to me, Super Street Fighter II on Super Nintendo, because
2593240	2599200	it was my very first Super Nintendo game that I, that was mine, and not my brother's, on
2599200	2608000	my Nintendo system, mine, me, it belonged to me, Kirby's Avalanche.
2608000	2614400	Special games, um, I don't know, I can't think of a whole lot that, like, Super Metroid I
2614400	2617560	suppose would be one, just that, you know, just because I think it's like the really
2617560	2620920	the greatest game ever.
2620920	2625020	I would have to, maybe I would go all the way back to like the Atari 2600 and say things
2625020	2628380	like Spider-Man, because those are some of my earliest gaming memories right there, so
2628380	2629960	those games are definitely special.
2629960	2635840	I have, you know, and I, sorry, this really makes me feel old, but I remember being, you
2635840	2643020	know, little, like a first grader, and going next door to my friend's house and playing
2643020	2651520	their Odyssey 2, and playing, um, I want to say it was like a Lord of the Rings game or
2651520	2656320	something, no it wasn't, it was, um, you play either as a fighter, a wizard, a changeling,
2656320	2661320	or something else, and, you know, and playing, what was that, um, Casey Munchkin's Crazy
2661320	2667560	Chase that got sued for being like Pac-Man, which I actually still have a copy of it,
2667560	2674320	you know, I guess, you know, I kind of have, you know, good memories of that, but I also
2674320	2679840	have good memories of playing Kix in elementary school.
2679840	2684400	I'll tell you what game I used to freaking love that's very special to me, it's an old
2684400	2688880	ass computer game called Rogue, I don't know if you've ever played this game, but you control
2688880	2692120	a little happy face looking thing, it was all done in ASCII graphics, but it was an
2692120	2696080	actual game, I think like Epyx or somebody put it out, but you play this little, um,
2696080	2700000	ASCII happy face that went around and, uh, through these tunnels and you were exploring,
2700000	2705160	you know, like a dungeon, and creatures were giant capital letters that would, like a B
2705160	2707520	for bat would attack you and all this stuff, so.
2707520	2713440	Sounds like quite a number of the old, um, it was old school, but great.
2713440	2721160	Well also, um, I have to say, when I was in second or third grade, we had a Clicca Vision,
2721160	2726800	and for me it was always playing Venture and Mouse Trap, which I suck at Venture now, but
2726800	2730880	you know, I guess, I guess it's like really a lot, because there's certain games that
2730880	2733720	I would be playing at a time that I'd attach to certain things that were going on in my
2733720	2740920	life at the time, and like, I think it's entirely hilarious, Dan was trying to, um, uh, I guess
2740920	2746700	catalog things that had happened in his life, and, um, he was doing a lot of it by sort
2746700	2751680	of what he was playing at that time and what grade he was in, and I thought that, you know,
2751680	2755080	honestly, that's sort of how I correlate a lot of stuff that happens to me too, because
2755080	2759520	I'll remember, oh, this happened, and at the time I was playing this, so I have that kind
2759520	2763520	of memory attachment, I guess.
2763520	2764520	Alright.
2764520	2768360	Loki, you're awfully quiet, not a lot of special video games for you?
2768360	2769360	He's looking at porn.
2769360	2770360	No special games?
2770360	2772040	Yeah, I'm looking at news.
2772040	2774480	Gals Panic is not a special game to you?
2774480	2776480	It was fun.
2776480	2777480	Alright.
2777480	2779480	No more emails?
2779480	2780480	No.
2780480	2781480	That's it?
2781480	2782480	Alright.
2782480	2786560	Oh, oh, oh, we have one particular attachment, remember, our names are attached to.
2786560	2787560	Hm?
2787560	2788560	OLR the game.
2788560	2789560	Oh, yeah.
2789560	2790560	The text game.
2790560	2791560	Oh, yes, of course.
2791560	2792560	The OLR text game.
2792560	2796000	Put that on our wiki, people.
2796000	2797000	Where is it?
2797000	2798000	Can you still get a copy of that?
2798000	2799000	It's got to be available somewhere.
2799000	2800000	I think I've got it somewhere.
2800000	2806000	Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, but we're going
2806000	2810040	to get to the Skype line very soon, we have some gaming news first.
2810040	2812540	Yes.
2812540	2819000	So there was a rumor going around that Def Leppard was going to be in Guitar Hero 4,
2819000	2823680	and actually it ended up turning out that wasn't exactly true.
2823680	2828960	It was during an interview with a band on the radio show Rockline, and I guess a caller
2828960	2833360	asked why none of their songs had been featured in Guitar Hero or Rockman, and of course their
2833360	2838960	guitarist Phil Cullen replied, revealing at least three of their hits would be featured
2838960	2840680	in Guitar Hero 4.
2840680	2844640	Rock of Ages, Animal, and of course, Photograph.
2844640	2848740	The problem is though, it actually isn't going to be featured in Guitar Hero 4, he
2848740	2852920	was wrong, it's actually download content that's going to be coming out soon for Guitar
2852920	2853920	Hero 3.
2853920	2854920	Oh, nice.
2854920	2860720	So, there will be Def Leppard songs, just not in Guitar Hero 4, at least not those songs.
2860720	2864720	There will be Def Leppard.
2864720	2865720	That's going to be fun.
2865720	2870100	Well, you know, I was thinking, we just had a story a couple weeks ago that really made
2870100	2874000	us think that arcades were dying, I mean we kind of already kind of knew that sadly arcades
2874000	2878160	are dying and they're just not what they used to be, and you know, I think we had another
2878160	2881680	story about, didn't we have the story last week about Namco's doing something with the
2881680	2884520	Wii in their arcades, or somebody trying to like integrate all that stuff?
2884520	2885920	Yeah, we talked about it last week.
2885920	2890720	Well, here's, I guess somebody else has faith in arcade games because apparently, Signature
2890720	2895320	Devices, they're hardware and software developers, they have sent word out that they are putting
2895320	2901820	final touches on a new four player arcade game that will quote, include several well
2901820	2905380	known comic book and television superheroes.
2905380	2910160	As to who those are, that's still a mystery, could be anything, I mean it could literally
2910160	2915120	be anything from the Marvel DC world all the way to heroes from NBC, although I kind of
2915120	2922100	doubt that, but I guess it's kind of interesting that all hope is not dead yet for arcades
2922100	2926000	and depending on what names are attached to this game, because you know, well known quote
2926000	2929800	unquote, you know, that could be Dora the Explorer as a hero to some, and I don't know
2929800	2934720	if that's going to be the one that gets people to come back, so hopefully it's the right
2934720	2935720	thing.
2935720	2940240	We'll have more information on that in the coming weeks.
2940240	2943400	Well, how about some other news then?
2943400	2944400	Alrighty.
2944400	2945400	Capcom!
2945400	2947400	As in Capcom's gamer's day.
2947400	2953480	Well, they're letting, like, people who are not the press go, except they're only letting
2953480	2960160	five of them go, so basically five lucky people are going to be able to get in and they're
2960160	2969520	actually calling it Captivate08, which is, I guess, kind of an interesting name, but
2969520	2977720	if you're lucky, you get to get in and play with everybody else, but basically I don't
2977720	2980480	really see, though, anything on here about how it actually is accomplished.
2980480	2985280	I think you have to write them, basically there's a little thingy, email them saying
2985280	2990480	why you think you should be able to go, and then they pick a winner out of that.
2990480	2996480	There's actually a link on there afterwards, but you basically said it, so there you go.
2996480	2997480	Beg!
2997480	2998480	That still sucks, though.
2998480	3000040	Get one and sell it on eBay.
3000040	3001880	Well, you should enter the contest.
3001880	3005560	Don't tell them you do this show, just tell them, you know, oh, I grew up on Mega Man
3005560	3009520	and I love Capcom and Street Fighter is so memorable to me, buh buh buh, write something
3009520	3011520	really cheesy and maybe they'll pick you.
3011520	3013520	They get to go anyway.
3013520	3015600	That's not a cool lie to them like that.
3015600	3016600	It's not lying.
3016600	3020720	No, you've got to say that you're part of an independent podcast and that they don't
3020720	3025240	give the little guy a fair shake, and then you make them feel bad.
3025240	3030000	And then they don't care, and then you say, well, fuck, your Mega Man games lately have
3030000	3031540	sucked so what do I care?
3031540	3037400	Let's say you enter it and then you lose because they say, oh, well, you know, you're a podcaster,
3037400	3041520	you know, then that's a double standard because then they're saying, oh, but podcasters and
3041520	3044760	people like that aren't supposed to come to this, so make up your mind.
3044760	3048280	It doesn't make any sense though, podcasters and people in the media aren't supposed to
3048280	3049280	come to their media event?
3049280	3050280	Oh, that sucks.
3050280	3054520	Oh, I'm sorry, we're not, you know, IGN or anything, so that's fine.
3054520	3055520	Whatever.
3055520	3061760	I don't want to play Mega Man, was it, Star Force, Zerker, X, you know, Sauron or Ninja
3061760	3062760	or whatever.
3062760	3064520	It'll all be on YouTube the day after anyway.
3064520	3067360	I really don't care.
3067360	3068760	I'm just bitter like that.
3068760	3069760	Well, I don't know.
3069760	3072400	The gamer day events we have gone to in the past have been kind of fun.
3072400	3073400	Yeah, all two of them.
3073400	3075440	It is kind of thrilling to be there, you know.
3075440	3080880	Yeah, Konami was the only ones that invited us and then they moved away, so.
3080880	3081880	Oh, bye-bye.
3081880	3082880	Bye-bye.
3082880	3083880	Okay.
3083880	3088920	Anyways, there's a game out there, this is free to play too, you don't have to go to
3088920	3091560	some stupid gamer's day to play it.
3091560	3094560	It's a game called Tetroid 2012.
3094560	3101200	It's a mash-up of Tetris and Arkanoid and actually I think a little bit like Silent
3101200	3104320	Hills, especially if you listen to some of the soundtrack for it.
3104320	3107140	It's really trippy, but it's free to download.
3107140	3112920	It's actually available on, let's see here, come over to the website.
3112920	3115960	It's a hundred and eleven meg download too, if I remember it correctly.
3115960	3121760	Lots of music and sound effects in there, but the website, to go check it out, it's
3121760	3128600	entity dot B E slash entity and then there's some links to the games that they make.
3128600	3134000	They made a, of course, this game and then I guess a remake of Tempest.
3134000	3136480	So if you're a fan of Tempest, you can check that out as well.
3136480	3137480	I heart Tempest.
3137480	3138480	I might have to check that.
3138480	3139960	Does it go super zap or recharge?
3139960	3142680	I don't know, but it's very trippy looking.
3142680	3146920	Before this though, from what I remember, I guess that they used to do like demo scene
3146920	3152120	stuff, you know, all the like encoding graphic little demos and stuff like that.
3152120	3155000	But it is a very trippy looking game.
3155000	3160280	I was looking at that Tetroid 2012 a little bit ago and it definitely looks interesting.
3160280	3164240	Because you charge up with like a little special meter and then when you hit the special button,
3164240	3168760	it flips the whole screen upside down and then you turn into like, you know, Arkanoid
3168760	3169760	mode or whatever.
3169760	3172480	I have to admit, that's kind of neat.
3172480	3177680	So hopefully we'll check that out a little later, at least maybe I'll download that and
3177680	3179160	check it out.
3179160	3183400	Another kind of indie thing that's come out and some folks mentioned this earlier in the
3183400	3186800	program, Rom Check Fail.
3186800	3192400	Rom Check Fail is like this mishmash of all of these like old school NES games.
3192400	3198720	It's got Legend of Zelda, Pac-Man, Mario Brothers, Spy Hunter, Kix, all this stuff in there.
3198720	3202840	But the interesting thing about it, it doesn't exactly play like these games.
3202840	3208340	Like for instance, you might be Link and you're in the Super Mario Brothers world and you're
3208340	3214320	trying to stab at asteroids and then all of a sudden you're Pac-Man and you're in Arkanoid.
3214320	3216600	It randomly changes your characters too.
3216600	3221720	So sometimes you will have like the really crappy, what was it, Space Invaders, you know,
3221720	3226560	ship and stuff like that or, you know, some of them can only, you know, shoot in one direction.
3226560	3230920	And you have to basically play them like, you know, their respective games.
3230920	3233440	It's a very interesting game.
3233440	3235400	You can check it out if you want to.
3235400	3241460	Indiegames.com, I-N-D-I-E-G-A-M-E-S.com actually had, oh I'm sorry, they're actually the ones
3241460	3249760	that I guess originally highlighted this and link directly to farbs.org that has the game,
3249760	3254200	F-A-R-B-S.O-R-G slash games dot HTML.
3254200	3258880	And they make some other games too like Polychromatic Funk Monkey.
3258880	3262220	That's the best name ever, Funk Monkey.
3262220	3264840	Is that what you're gonna name your band now, Polychromatic Funk Monkey?
3264840	3265840	Sure, why not.
3265840	3267100	All right, there you got it.
3267100	3268360	Let's see, what's the definition here.
3268360	3271760	As anyone who's built maps for tile-based platforming games would tell you, building
3271760	3274600	maps for tile-based platforming games is fun.
3274600	3278980	That's why I made Polychromatic Funk Monkey a tile-based platforming game about building
3278980	3284860	maps for tile-based platforming games. In Polychromatic Funk Monkey, the eponymous
3284860	3289500	monkey of funk brings order and rhythm to his chaotic land, arranging the blocks
3289500	3294900	he finds into towering staircases and bridges in the sky. Sounds like a riot.
3294900	3300380	And then there's another game called Fishy Fishy. I think this might be one of
3300380	3307060	my new favorite developers. That's beautiful. You can get them on the show.
3307060	3313460	I will send an email this week and see what we can do. Okay. But he'll have to
3313460	3318060	wait because I'm not doing anything special for Life 365, so maybe we can
3318060	3321900	have him on our Debut All Games episode. I have to say that I watched someone play
3321900	3327260	through a whole game of Romcheck Fail. I was cracking up the entire
3327260	3334660	time. Romcheck win! I know, win for reals. So guess what? What? We have more news.
3334660	3342180	Okay. Paramount is going to be getting into games. They are going to be
3342180	3350380	doing a mobile handheld casual games because they make money and a lot of
3350380	3354300	them are talking about tie-ins between their movie franchises and these games.
3354300	3361260	So hey, that'd be cool. Here's the other thing I bet happened. Paramount realized
3361260	3366500	rider's strike, loss of money, people aren't going to the movies like they
3366500	3373220	used to, video games, money machine. What would you do? They also may have realized
3373220	3381620	hey, Sony, Warner, Vivendi, they're all in games as well. Vivendi? Vivendi. You said
3381620	3392100	Vinvidi. Whatever. Fusion of Vivendi and Nvidia. Vivendi, whatever. Oh, and Disney or
3392100	3402260	Buena Vista. They're all in games, so why not them? Hooray! One game that they're
3402260	3406740	not making but you can get for dirt cheap, at least this weekend, Steam has
3406740	3412620	been offering Prey for $4.95 this weekend only. So apparently if you listen to this on
3412620	3417540	podcasts you've missed out, unless you bought this already. But get it now
3417540	3422820	because you only have a few hours left before this deal is up. And Prey, for
3422820	3428260	those who may not remember, was a 3D Realms game, not Duke Nukem Forever, and
3428260	3434940	involved you, a Native American, to be basically abducted onto a ship where
3434940	3440940	there's a bunch of weird, crazy shit and you can never die. We can die in the very
3440940	3444500	early levels if you're not good at first-person shooters. I died once in the
3444500	3447420	early levels because I'm horrible at first-person shooters. I played it on the
3447420	3451220	Xbox 360. It's not bad and it has beautiful soundtrack. It has an absolutely
3451220	3454820	gorgeous soundtrack. It's from the guy who did Oblivion and Guild Wars and all
3454820	3459980	that, so you know the music's good. The game itself, kind of a little short. Like, I
3459980	3464020	remember it kind of just ended suddenly, but definitely made way for a sequel.
3464020	3469420	So, all right. Five bucks, though. That's not too bad of a deal for a game like that,
3469420	3473260	especially on PC. Maybe I'll actually get that. What the hell? I'm on a
3473260	3477740	shopping spree this weekend on Steam. I only have a couple hours left?
3477740	3481900	All right, get out of my house, people. I gotta download Prey. All right, if you
3481900	3485820	would like to give us a call and chat with us, join us on the Skype line. It's
3485820	3492580	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. The Skype line is
3492580	3497900	now open, so give us a call. We're already getting a call.
3497900	3505380	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3505380	3510860	Who's this? Yeah, you're just a little quiet, but maybe that's our studio mic.
3510860	3518860	What's on your mind, Zaku? Nothing. Mine's just trying to go through, you
3518860	3524300	know, it kind of sucks that you have to ditch Live 365. Well, it kind of sucks
3524300	3527140	they had to double their rates. Hold on, you are really quiet. Can you get closer
3527140	3530020	to your microphone? It's not just us. You're coming through really quiet on the
3530020	3537020	thing. Okay, much better. This better. Much better. All right, what's on
3537020	3542140	your mind? So it sucks we have to leave Live 365. Let me see, I was gonna get
3542140	3548380	Rainbow Six Vegas, but from what I read, Ubisoft's not doing their job
3548380	3553700	and trying to get away the shit out of it. You know, all the bugs on the PS3 and
3553700	3558980	360 that are making me jittery and just making me nervous right now before, you
3558980	3565860	know, or even buy the damn thing. You said it was Rainbow Six Vegas 2? 2, yeah.
3565860	3569980	2. Have you played Rainbow Six Vegas 2? I don't like Tom Clancy games. No, I have
3569980	3573180	some folks on my Xbox Live list though that have been playing nothing but that
3573180	3579700	lately. Yeah, they're lucky enough through the crap that, you know, the current bugs that
3579700	3586780	haven't been fixed yet. Did you actually buy the game or are you just
3586780	3591700	worried about it? Not yet. I just read it on Kotaku, that's the thing. I just read,
3591700	3594780	you know, I read it from other folks that the PS3 version of the servers were
3594780	3599300	like, you know, we're basically, we're going, we're just getting really flaky
3599300	3604460	and just not connecting through games. 360 version was about the same with very
3604460	3608660	noticeable glitches and whatnot. So I kind of like, you know, I'm waiting right
3608660	3613260	now so I'm getting paid tomorrow. Hopefully if they fix the, if there's a patch
3613260	3617900	coming out very soon, that's all I need for me to actually go down to game
3617900	3624260	shop and buy the game. Well, is there anybody in chat at our chat room?
3624260	3629740	chat.orangelandtrader.com that maybe has some suggestions on this
3629740	3633660	game? Like, is it worth the, worth buying it now or should he wait for a patch or
3633660	3636940	what? Because, yeah, Loki doesn't play those games. I don't think Jamie's played
3636940	3640420	it and I have not played it so I'm kind of curious if anyone in our chat has
3640420	3645860	anything to say about it. We'll see. It's part of the beauty of doing this live
3645860	3648540	with the chat room. When we are not familiar with it, hopefully somebody
3648540	3652740	else is. Well, what else is on your mind, Zaku, while we wait for some comments?
3652740	3656580	Well, I know, I know I don't like to bring up, you know, Bimani that much, but EMUs?
3656580	3662260	Mm-hmm. By now you've probably heard it's already rolling out on, on some, on
3662260	3666460	somewhat of a national level, although it's in one arcade. Yeah, we covered the
3666460	3671020	one arcade a couple weeks ago. Has it rolled out to more yet? Still, I mean, no
3671020	3677180	unlocks so far, so I'm not sure whether, you know, at this rate if we're, if we're
3677180	3681340	trying to catch up to Japan in terms of unlocking the game, so at the time they're
3681340	3687460	done, we'll be done in like, what, October, November at that rate? Well, they've only
3687460	3691700	got one arcade working on it. Hey, we got a response, we got a response about Vegas
3691700	3696460	2. Ross2UT says, well, I got my version of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 exchange for the
3696460	3701140	360 and it's fine aside from the odd frame rate drop, which never becomes
3701140	3705940	unplayable. Online co-op is absolutely amazing, especially as you actually go
3705940	3711020	through the story this time. There you have it. Sounds like a fairly
3711020	3716580	favorable review. Yeah. Alright, Zaku, anything else before we let you go and
3716580	3722300	take some more calls? Any plans on finding a good replacement for Live 365
3722300	3728100	that won't involve, you know, cleaning royalties up the ass? Yes, listen to Part A, we are going to be
3728100	3732740	merging with AllGames.com and doing our show live on their feed and we, you
3732740	3737860	won't have to register any of that stuff anymore, it's gonna be great. So, so in
3737860	3742100	terms of the radio station, that's done for, you know, that's done for good, right? As far as
3742100	3747740	the 24-hour, seven-week, or 24-hour day, seven-day week feed, yes, it's, we're not
3747740	3750980	gonna be operating it on Live 365 anymore. Instead, we're gonna be
3750980	3754220	trying to come together with other independent podcasters to create a
3754220	3759380	Voltron network. Oh, really now? Oh, really. Will you still be able to play the music
3759380	3763780	eventually? Mm-hmm. Nothing is changing on our show, everything is staying the same.
3763780	3770260	Right, of course, I, you know, I just, you know, just wanted to be kept in the loop, just
3770260	3775700	like everyone else. I just got in right now, just playing like, playing my 360 up until
3775700	3779300	like an hour ago. Alright, well check out Part A, check out Part A when it goes up
3779300	3782620	later tonight, it has all the details, alrighty? Alright. Alright, take care,
3782620	3788260	buddy. Have a good one. Alright, if you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on
3788260	3793140	Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, let's take another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio,
3793140	3800300	who's this? GS68. Hello, GS68, what is on your mind? I've been, okay, I've been
3800300	3804500	reading the comments for this one story and think about how PC's, PC gaming is
3804500	3808940	dying, and like, there's a lot of like, comments saying about how PC gaming is
3808940	3815260	not dead, and how like, PC gaming is superior to consoles and crap, I mean, they
3815260	3819900	got me wondering, I mean, aside from the games, what do consoles have on PCs? I
3819900	3825740	mean, and then like, there's some people talking about how like, keyboard and mouse
3825740	3829820	like, goes great with like, how like, there should be keyboard and mouse support for
3829820	3836700	every PS3 game, among other things. Um, I don't know, I, I don't think there's a lot
3836700	3840640	of truth to that whole PC gaming is dying, I think it's that when a game
3840640	3844860	comes out on the PC and the console, the console tends to do a little better, but
3844860	3849340	come on, look at a game, but look at a game like World of Warcraft, that's huge,
3849340	3853020	you know what, millions of, that's only on the PC, you're not gonna, I'm not exactly
3853020	3858820	talking about like, PC games dying, I'm just talking about like, I mean, a lot of
3858820	3866100	people saying how PC gaming is superior to console gaming, and how PC can like, do
3866100	3872020	everything from like, for your homework or browsing the internet, and, and you
3872020	3877380	don't have to buy like, $500 consoles like, every few years, just upgraded PCs, I
3877380	3882380	mean, with that said, I mean, what do consoles have on PCs, I mean, besides the
3882380	3888160	games on them? I think consoles also have a lot of convenience for them, keep in
3888160	3891060	mind, again, and I think I've used this argument earlier in the show, but keep in
3891060	3895060	mind that the gaming hardcore, the gaming hobbyists, the people that are likely to
3895060	3899900	listen to this show and all that, you know, you're included in this, the way we
3899900	3904860	play games and all that is not the same as necessarily everybody who buys them,
3904860	3908860	there's a large amount of people who want to just pop a cartridge in a system
3908860	3912820	and go, and the fact that it hook up, hooks up to the TV, so you don't have to
3912820	3915740	buy all this other stuff, I mean, I think that's kind of how console gaming sort of
3915740	3919540	took off in the first place, is that it hooked up to your TV, you didn't have to
3919540	3922380	buy any type of separate monitor, you didn't have to buy, you know, separate
3922380	3928380	stuff, I would say, I would argue, those that remember when the Commodore 64 was
3928380	3932180	out in this country, and you know, it did very well in Europe as well, that's one
3932180	3935900	reason the Commodore 64 did so great, is because not only did the Commodore 64
3935900	3940020	have a monitor it would hook up to, but it also would hook up to your TV, and
3940020	3943340	that was a pretty big deal, to have a home computer that actually was on your
3943340	3947780	TV as well, so I think there really is just that convenience of having it in
3947780	3953820	your living room. I mean, even games that normally do on consoles, like 2D
3953820	3959460	platformers and scrolling shooters, I mean, there are, I mean, there are like
3959460	3964980	free games at that store that you can download on the PC, I mean, like, look at
3964980	3970820	Cave Story and Disreducted, so yeah, Llamalana, I mean, those are great
3970820	3976500	platforms, but they're not on consoles, I mean, they're for the PC, and they're
3976500	3983500	free, I mean, there's, I mean, I can't name any free console games, or free indie
3983500	3989020	console games. I'll give you one, and I hate to say it, but Yaris, but, well, there
3989020	3994860	was also Age's Wing, and, you know, a few of those, a very, very few handful
3994860	3999300	available on Xbox Live. I would like to see more, I would like to see a
3999300	4003600	subscription-based available service, or, you know, some more free perks on the
4003600	4007300	consoles here and there, but there isn't a lot of money to be made in free,
4007300	4012060	unfortunately, and with those consoles, to buy a development kit for those
4012060	4019300	consoles costs thousands and thousands of dollars, so unless they are specifically
4019300	4025260	reaching out to the indie crowd, such as XNA does, it's very difficult to procure
4025260	4031260	one of those systems and make games for it, whereas with a PC, well, it's very
4031260	4035820	easy, I mean, in comparison to just, you know, fire up a coding program, and a
4035820	4039680	C++ compiler, or whatever language you want to program in, and make your game, you
4039680	4045220	know what I mean? So, I think that's kind of the difference is that it's more
4045220	4049100	accessible to make stuff indie-wise on the PC than it is for consoles who have
4049100	4056140	a very closed authoring format. So, all right, well, GS68, do you have anything
4056140	4060100	else you want to share or ask us tonight? I have, but I have Tip of the Tongue
4060100	4066220	Syndrome right now. Oh, that's all right. Well, thank you very much for calling, and
4066220	4070460	I'm sure we'll hear from you again. It won't be the last time, right? No. All
4070460	4076420	right, well, take care, buddy. Have a good one. All right, if you want to give us a
4076420	4081820	call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. You're
4081820	4085940	wearing the ferret on your head, DarkSakura? I love the ferret. I know you do.
4085940	4089940	Too bad it's not on camera. All right, yeah, too bad it's not on the camera. All right,
4089940	4093180	my ferret headgear. Can I wear the ferret on my head for a little bit on the cam? I
4093180	4097100	don't even know if Justin.TV is working right now. I've been very terrible at
4097100	4101460	checking that chat tonight. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, it's
4101460	4106180	DJ Ramba S from Anime Jam Sessions. Well, hello, DJ Ramba S from Anime Jam
4106180	4111340	Sessions. What's up? Not much, and that was me that told you that we were doing a
4111340	4116020	live feed of OLR from Anime Boston. Did it happen? Did it actually happen?
4116020	4120020	Partially. When we got there, we started setting up, I started to feed, and I'm
4120020	4126220	like, okay, where's the power? Where's the power? I see other dealers, other vendors
4126220	4133740	with power. I'm like, okay. I go over to the convention head, center head to get
4133740	4138980	power, and it's like 119 for the full weekend, so we're like... This is a long no
4138980	4144980	answer, isn't it? So I was like, no. So we ended up having the feed a little bit on
4144980	4149580	Friday and for about a couple of hours on Sunday. Did you, were you here for the
4149580	4153980	announcement? Because that was a heck of a show to be listening to. No, I was
4153980	4158580	having a WrestleMania 24 party, but I did hear the announcement about
4158580	4163580	where OLR is heading off to. Okay, cool. I was just like, yeah, that was, last week
4163580	4166380	was an interesting week, but we didn't know ourselves until about 45 minutes
4166380	4171020	before we went on air, just what was about to happen, so anyway. Well, because the
4171020	4174340	thing is, I actually know somebody that probably would have kept you guys going
4174340	4180460	for 24-7. It's, you know, it's okay. We got a lot of great offers along those
4180460	4186660	types of lines, but we're excited about the powers of Voltron, so we'll see
4186660	4189900	what happens. I think it's gonna be exciting. Well, what else is on your mind,
4189900	4195660	Rama? Not too much of one. The basic give you guys a basic con rap of anime Boston,
4195660	4200020	and believe it or not, you want to know what most popular items in the dealer's
4200020	4204880	room was? Final Fantasy 7 related material. Nope.
4204880	4209780	Yowie. There's always the number two item sold at dealer's rooms.
4209780	4218420	Dolphies. No. I bet there were some, though. I did see a couple. All right, what? I give up.
4218420	4224460	Nintendo merchandise. Almost every single vendor had all kinds of Super
4224460	4227800	Mario Brothers or standard Nintendo merchandise that was selling like hot
4227800	4233180	cakes. Oh yeah, was WYSIWYG there? Yes, they were. They are the big culprits for
4233180	4239660	the Nintendo goods, plus they sell Pocky. Well, they weren't selling Pocky
4239660	4243980	at this condo. Sad! They can't, because when your
4243980	4247660	convention is in a convention center, according to the contract, you're not allowed to sell
4247660	4253420	food. Well, that sucks, because I bought every burger at Fauna Mae last year. Is that the
4253420	4258380	candy hamburger stuff? Yes, the candy hamburger. I love that stuff. That stuff is really good. Well, that stuff is fine, but you
4258380	4262220	can't sell like Pocky or Ramenade and stuff like that. That you
4262220	4269440	can't sell. Lame. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. It's kind of crazy, though, but me and my
4269440	4273620	crew, we're trying to figure out like a way around that. Well, good luck to you.
4273620	4279460	How was the con otherwise? Good times? It was great. The number one problem
4279460	4287500	was the long, long, long, long. Did I mention long lines for registration? Oh, of course.
4287500	4291540	That seems to be the problem with a lot of anime cons, is long registration lines. Yeah,
4291540	4295980	but at most cons, it's like you wait no more than an hour to get your badge. There were
4295980	4300580	people that were waiting anywhere between five and eleven hours for their badges. Eleven
4300580	4307220	hours to get a badge? You've got to be fucking kidding me. Yes, I'm not kidding. Nope. That's
4307220	4311700	crazy talk. Yeah, they print them out on these machines and the machines broke. There's only
4311700	4319100	four people on registration and the lines were going forever. Um, someone posted a link.
4319100	4326460	They did a parody of Still Alive to Still In Line. Nice. I think, and I've been suggesting
4326460	4333340	this for a while now, for conventions, they should take the old E3 approach and mail your
4333340	4339140	pass. Yeah, there are some conventions that do that, but the problem is dealing with the
4339140	4343460	mail and individual postage and the stamping and stuff. At most conventions, the easiest
4343460	4348060	thing to do is just do the normal pre-reg. You show up with proof that it's yours. They
4348060	4352420	print out the label, slap it on your badge, run it through the laminator, and send you
4352420	4359580	off. Or just don't make fancy fucking badges. Maybe people need to cut back on the badges
4359580	4368020	a little bit. But it's really not that hard to mass produce the badges like that. I honestly
4368020	4373140	think that there can be some sort of, and this is actually even a way for them to make
4373140	4378420	the money for shipping because all you have to do is mail them out by whatever bulk rate
4378420	4384340	I guess would be available for business, but have them printed out and you pay like X amount
4384340	4391660	extra to have your badge mailed to you. I know that's a good thing. I actually know
4391660	4396700	a couple of people that are like reg department heads that worked reg, and they say it just
4396700	4401780	doesn't work that way. It wouldn't work out. It wouldn't be all that cost effective. That's
4401780	4406820	how it is. Hence the paying a little extra. Yeah. I mean, that was the only method. If
4406820	4413460	someone wants to avoid the long line, then just say, well, I will pay another five dollars
4413460	4417740	for postage and you can mail it to me. Well, what some cons are doing now, they're offering
4417740	4424020	like two year badges, three year badges, lifetime badges, and pre-con night. The thing is, not
4424020	4428180	everybody's going to come up Thursday night for convention. So to give that option, and
4428180	4432260	a lot of people still do it, but the difference is you show up Thursday, you get your badge
4432260	4438900	under 15 minutes tops. AX did the day before thing, and it was just as much of a pardon
4438900	4445540	in the expression clusterfuck as it is doing day of. Interesting. All right. So if you're
4445540	4450340	not there by 10 a.m., you're basically SOL. Well, we had to wrap up, Rama. Definitely
4450340	4453100	some lessons learned for anybody thinking about throwing it on at a convention in the
4453100	4458720	near future, but any last minute thoughts for our folks? Three links I posted in a chat
4458720	4465140	room took pictures from my website. One picture is a cart, a facial looking like World 1-1
4465140	4469060	from Super Mario Brothers, and the last two pictures is the old man from The Legend of
4469060	4477220	Zelda. The first one says, it's dangerous to go alone, take this, and the second one
4477220	4486220	says, Dodongo dislikes smoke. I figured you'd get a kick out of that. Sorry, I'm looking
4486220	4491620	at the picture. That's great. I know this is horrible radio, but there actually is somebody
4491620	4495340	dressed up holding a big old poster board that says, it's dangerous to go alone, take
4495340	4503140	this. But where's the sword? Hello? Or the cannon? If you go to djvaughness.net and click
4503140	4507300	on gallery, you'll see all the pictures from anime boss in the OA. It's like 320 shots
4507300	4511540	I took. All right. Sounds like fun. All right, Rama, we got to let you go. Take more calls.
4511540	4516220	All right. Take care, guys. All right. One more call, and we're going to call it a night.
4516220	4523100	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. And while we wait for a call, Loki, any quick
4523100	4529780	last minute stories? Yeah, I've been gathering stories this entire time. Oh, we got one more.
4529780	4538020	I love cutting you off. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? The ferret's going to go. But
4538020	4542940	we don't want the ferret to go, Bobby. I don't think people can handle hearing the ferret
4542940	4551820	in a 96K stereo. I should make an audio out for that ferret. You know what? Just think
4551820	4558380	of it this way, though, DarkSakura. Viking funeral for the ferret. I'll take the ferret
4558380	4564380	home with me. No, I don't think Bobby's serious about the ferret, are you, Bobby? No, I'm
4564380	4569380	not. I know you're not. What's on your mind, Bobby? Nothing much. I've been hanging out
4569380	4573380	in the chat room trying to calm everybody's fears. Yeah, about like, OMG, we're going
4573380	4577620	to have to suddenly change everything we're doing. And I'm kind of like, have you ever
4577620	4583760	listened to the other shows on AllGames.com? Yeah, don't worry about it. What would we
4583760	4590060	have to change? Other than maybe I'll have to bring on a soundboard. No, I'm just kidding.
4590060	4595140	And you'll have to get rid of the ferret. And the ferret. And we're going to put a big
4595140	4599860	picture on our, big thing on our site, you know, saying, hey, you know, Orange Tons Radio
4599860	4603340	is coming in, we're going to get like Tingle, and we're going to Photoshop Loki's head on
4603340	4608700	it and that's going to be your new logo. It's going to be awesome. Nice. Can't wait. See,
4608700	4612100	these are all the type of editorial decisions that are being made for us now. That's the
4612100	4620180	closest you'll ever get. I'll go buy adjustment again. Go ahead, Neil. What, how many copies
4620180	4625520	are we up to? We haven't had an update in a long time. Yes, I want you to look it up.
4625520	4629020	The listeners demand to know this. What's new in your gaming world, Bobby? What types
4629020	4633500	of stuff have you been playing lately and enjoying? Believe it or not, recently I've
4633500	4638740	picked up, I got an old retro Japanese RPG kick. Recently started playing the original
4638740	4645260	Suikoden again. Oh. And it was mainly because somebody wrote me on my PS3 saying, why don't
4645260	4649620	you ever play games on your PS3? So I'm playing Suikoden. So you're playing a PS1 game on
4649620	4657300	your PS3. Nice. Yes. But it counts. I'm gaming on it. I'm not curing cancer. Your thing just
4657300	4661860	sits there on all the time. Well, not on, but it's sleeping mode or whatever, just curing
4661860	4667420	cancer all day, right, with folding it home. And I'm leading my team. Are you? I'm leading
4667420	4671780	the all games radio team. I stopped running that app a long time ago. But if I get a PlayStation
4671780	4676620	3, Bobby, we will work together, this Voltron of podcasts, to cure cancer, because only
4676620	4681900	Voltron can cure cancer. Here's what we're at right now. We're still at 0.18 million.
4681900	4687740	But the problem is it's not tracking the UK sales. But I can guarantee that they're not
4687740	4693580	any more than the US sales. So even if the number were doubled, you would still not be
4693580	4700340	to where you need to be. Very sad to hear that. So never going to happen. I'm not sad
4700340	4707220	to hear that. In fact, they only sold, was it week 10, which I guess was last week, they
4707220	4714500	sold 8,627 units in the US. Now how about copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever? I don't
4714500	4720420	even think that's on here. I don't think they're even tracking that one. I'll get back to you
4720420	4726260	on that. All right, please do. They're not tracking it because it's just too many. Yes,
4726260	4731660	that's right. It blew sales through the roof. Bobby, any other things that our listeners
4731660	4738380	ought to know about this whole All Games transition or anything they should know about allgames.com
4738380	4745780	and why it's the place for OLR? Well, for one, no more ads if you try to listen
4745780	4750740	to the live stream and no more funky players that you have to click through things to get
4750740	4756740	to it, you go to allgames.com or you go to allgamesradio.com, which is a smaller version of our radio stream
4756740	4763380	and it just automatically plays. Or you can get it on your PSP or I think we're even in
4763380	4767640	the iTunes thing if it pulls from the shoutcast directory. Basically anywhere there's a shoutcast
4767640	4773700	directory, you can get to our stream. It automatically starts playing. You're listening to this station
4773700	4779060	and it's brought to you by this right now. So it's going to be very easy. It's a higher
4779060	4786820	quality, no more MP3 Pro, but we don't plan to have you guys change anything music-wise
4786820	4792660	or anything. I know a lot of people are like, what about the music and stuff? Rob, you know
4792660	4797460	that I'm willing to talk to you about that and maybe even doing a music block from your
4797460	4802540	library or even just merging your library of music into ours during the 24x7 stream
4802540	4807380	and bringing some of your other talk programs over. I'm not keeping this only to the Sunday
4807380	4814700	night thing. Very cool. That's part of why it was a good idea. It's not just that All
4814700	4821780	Games is sucking this show up and tearing it away from what we had. I think one way
4821780	4825780	when we were talking about it was that it's now the resources of the three of us that
4825780	4831660	make this show happen and some of the other people behind OLR are now troops in the allgames.com
4831660	4836100	universe and can work towards building good ideas there. I think it's going to be great
4836100	4840740	because I know everybody over there has got ideas. Lord knows we have ideas of our own.
4840740	4845140	It's just going to keep going from there. It's going to be great.
4845140	4849020	We'll send the camera crew up there for Loki and the Tingle outfit and everything.
4849020	4854900	Awesome. Can't wait. That would be awesome whenever that doesn't really happen.
4854900	4861260	It will be at PAX. I will say this because I know you're thinking about coming up to
4861260	4865460	PAX. We're actually trying to do something really big at PAX in terms of live streaming
4865460	4869460	and I'm going up there. Kropotkin and Hendrix are actually coming out. Kropotkin is coming
4869460	4876940	out from the UK flying at PAX. We've got a couple of our Chatterbox is always up there.
4876940	4880460	Evil Avatar is their 10th anniversary for evilavatar.com. They're doing a big thing
4880460	4885780	as well. Evil Avatar Radio is one of our affiliates. We're planning on doing some big stuff at
4885780	4893180	PAX. I'd love to see you guys represented with or without the Tingle outfit.
4893180	4899820	It's mid-August, right? Last weekend in August. It's actually Labor Day weekend. It's the
4899820	4903620	same weekend as Dragon Con for those that attend Dragon Con.
4903620	4909140	For you especially. That's a bummer. I chose PAX.
4909140	4914540	PAX is more gaming anyway. Dragon Con is a little more D20s and stuff, right?
4914540	4919140	Dragon Con is more let's all fawn over Joss Whedon and everything he's touched.
4919140	4926180	Yes. I don't know. Dark Sakura might choose to go there. I wouldn't phrase it that way.
4926180	4930700	I think Joss is the man. Definitely. I haven't been to PAX. I want
4930700	4935580	to go. I like what I'm hearing and we'll have to see what we can do to make that happen,
4935580	4939360	especially if it's a long weekend and it's that far off. I don't see why at least I can't
4939360	4943300	get up there. Hopefully, if the monies work out, we can get everybody up there somehow.
4943300	4947020	We might be able to make work. We have to get the wife to agree to let Loki go.
4947020	4952220	I might actually be able to go because we do our game conferencing at my work, which
4952220	4957240	is almost the same thing as PAX, except I get to learn a lot more about stuff coming
4957240	4960900	out and that kind of thing. Oh, we should have a good report after that.
4960900	4967020	We'll see. The third thing about PAX for people, since
4967020	4972940	it is open to the public, and this is the way that I kind of explain it. PAX is exactly
4972940	4982000	what people thought E3 was. All the cool stuff that was in people's head about E3, that's
4982000	4987080	exactly what PAX is. E3 wouldn't have lived up to it. E3 had the show floor, but that
4987080	4993640	was it. PAX has the show floor. It's got concerts at night. It's got community gaming areas.
4993640	4998420	You can just get a bunch of your friends to rent a game and just take it to a console
4998420	5002700	and just sit there and play a game with your friends and stuff. That's a lot of stuff that
5002700	5009060	E3 didn't have. It's way more community oriented. It's basically what people thought E3 was.
5009060	5010780	People who had never been to E3, it's what they thought it was.
5010780	5013620	Sounds like it's going to be a ton of fun. We'll definitely have to make that happen.
5013620	5017260	The only reason I didn't go last year, the only thing that stopped me from going last
5017260	5022180	year, is that my BFF from college got married that exact same weekend. She said if I did
5022180	5028300	not go to her wedding, I would be killed. This year, no one is getting married that
5028300	5035300	I know of. No weddings. Don't plan it during PAX because I want to go.
5035300	5040020	We'll be doing live streaming from there, so we'd love to have you guys as part of it.
5040020	5042860	Excellent. We'll see what we can do, Bobby. Bobby, we've got to let you go because we're
5042860	5046260	going to wrap this show up. It's getting really late for you guys out there, so we're going
5046260	5048860	to wrap it up. Kill the ferret.
5048860	5055420	We'll try. Have a good one, Bobby. We look forward to being partnered up with you on
5055420	5056900	Sunday nights. I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
5056900	5058980	It'll be a lot of fun on April 13th.
5058980	5063700	All right. That's D-Day. Have a good one, Bobby.
5063700	5064700	Always enjoy hearing from Bobby.
5064700	5068960	All right. We're going to close up the Skype line now. We're running a little long here
5068960	5072900	in Part B, which is okay. We can go as long as we want, and we'll get to continue to go
5072900	5077060	as long as we want on all games. They're not scheduling anything after us. It's beautiful.
5077060	5081160	All right. Loki did want to get to some last minute stories, so I suppose we should get
5081160	5082160	those out.
5082160	5087140	We've got a ton of them now, thanks to you cutting me off all the time. Dick. Let's see
5087140	5091540	here. We'll just go down the list, then, of all the wonderful stuff, whether it be important
5091540	5092900	or not.
5092900	5100580	SoCom Confrontation comes out on the PSN, or the PlayStation Network, September 16th,
5100580	5108540	and a great addition to the SoCom series. It looks pretty, and yeah, look forward to
5108540	5109540	that in the fall.
5109540	5113260	Another game coming in the fall, Far Cry 2, that's coming to consoles. They'll release
5113260	5121380	Xbox 360 and PS3, as well as PC. No word on exactly when, but fall-ish area.
5121380	5127580	Madden turns 20 this year, and Madden 09 will be coming out August 12th, as well as a collector's
5127580	5133660	edition, which will feature exclusively NFL Head Coach 09, which I'm glad, because that
5133660	5138520	game sucks, or at least looks like crap. I know the first one didn't sell very well for
5138520	5142620	me, and I don't want to push this one, so awesome.
5142620	5148740	And let's see here. There is a rumor about what Sega will be showing off at their Gamers
5148740	5155180	Day. Some of the stuff rumored in there, a brand new Knights game, and also a new Eternal
5155180	5161700	Arcadia game. Some other stuff, of course, a preview for Sonic Unleashed, which I think
5161700	5168460	we've all seen that anyways, and a game called The Crucible, Evil Within. I hope that's not
5168460	5176820	based off the book, and you know where I want to go with this, and I'm just biting my tongue,
5176820	5180700	but that is too funny that they are actually thinking about putting a game about which
5180700	5187100	trials out, which... I don't know if it's based on that, but...
5187100	5190300	You can't write that, folks. You can't write it.
5190300	5197300	And Super Monkey Ball for the iPhone, tentative. Also, Samba de Amigo.
5197300	5199740	Wait, Samba de Amigo on the iPhone?
5199740	5200740	No.
5200740	5202740	Oh. Oui. Oh. Okay.
5202740	5209340	Let's come out of this summer, by the way. Remember we talked a little bit a while back
5209340	5213740	about that homebrew game being made, Super Mario Fusion, that's going to have levels
5213740	5218180	featuring Mega Man and Halo and stuff like that? Well, they have a new video up now that
5218180	5223200	shows one of the new suits you can get from Mario, which is a Mega Man suit with all the
5223200	5227060	sound effects and stuff from Mega Man. There's also apparently a Halo Spartan suit that you
5227060	5231460	can get from Mario as well, so looking for that game when that comes out eventually.
5231460	5237460	There's a rumor that some DS Lite colors are coming to the UK soon, including green, ice,
5237460	5243020	blue, and red, and I'm not surprised, because Nintendo likes to put out a ton of different
5243020	5247340	colors of these things. French retailer is listing Grand Theft Auto
5247340	5252420	4 for the DS, although that might be a misprint, but who knows?
5252420	5258780	Let's see here... Echo Chrome's coming to the US, like we said, I think sometime in
5258780	5264640	April, for 10 bucks, so that's not bad. Right now, you can actually download on the
5264640	5270500	PlayStation Store R-Type command, if you want to play a demo of that for the PSP. That's
5270500	5276620	that one that's like a RTS R-Type game. It's kind of weird.
5276620	5279500	Interesting. Another game coming out in April, Happy Tree
5279500	5285580	Friends, False Alarms, coming to Xbox Live Arcade. That'll be pretty interesting to see.
5285580	5290260	Speaking of Xbox Live Arcade, it's actually going to be down on April 1st, that's not
5290260	5294380	a joke, and they'll be doing some maintenance on there.
5294380	5299100	Another game actually coming out next week, and this will be cool if this is true, the
5299100	5306940	Xbox Live Arcade game for this week, Mr. Driller Online. It has been spotted on the Japanese
5306940	5312380	Xbox.com site for 800 Microsoft points. It's going to feature two to four player multiplayer
5312380	5317740	battles, three to four player multiplayer tag battles, and single player standard driller,
5317740	5325260	single player quest driller 100 puzzles. That's kind of neat.
5325260	5331060	And that's it. All right. That was a lot of last minute stories. There's a lot of late
5331060	5333900	breaking stuff tonight, or just stuff we were too lazy to get to otherwise.
5333900	5343580	And I'm going to post this in chat room. It's a wallpaper featuring portal warning signs.
5343580	5346020	It's funny. All right. We'll check that out.
5346020	5350660	Now, that's going to bring us to the end of our show, except we've got one more thing
5350660	5355700	to do, and that's go around and get everybody's final thought. Dark Soccer, your final thought.
5355700	5361580	Ferret. My final thought is, why did I go out and
5361580	5365580	get the Ferret? I could have just told her that I lost it forever.
5365580	5367700	I'm nice. That's my final thought. I'm super nice.
5367700	5371140	I could have kicked you. Loki, your final thought.
5371140	5375300	My final thought is, I want to get to playing some more games this week. I have a lot on
5375300	5380260	my plate and a lot that I haven't gotten to yet, and hopefully we'll get some curling
5380260	5386500	action going on after the show on Justin TV. That's right. Hopefully the video cap works
5386500	5387740	this week as opposed to last week's price score.
5387740	5391660	Well, that was the PSP, and the PSP apparently sucks for video outs.
5391660	5395860	Yes. Final thought, lesson learned. I didn't know this before. Maybe I'm just stupid, but
5395860	5398500	if you want to do video out, you have to do component. You can't do.
5398500	5403320	You can't do games over composite, which is, you know, they don't seem to mention that
5403320	5407980	on the packaging for composite cables or anything. It's something you kind of have to learn,
5407980	5412420	so I'd be pretty pissed off if I didn't have a high-def TV and I was trying to do video
5412420	5417320	out on that stuff. Apparently it works for UMD movies, but why they can't implement that
5417320	5422020	for, you know, the composite cables is beyond me. I don't know.
5422020	5425620	All right. Well, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank
5425620	5429740	you guys so much for tuning into us and downloading and supporting independent radio and independent
5429740	5433220	podcasting. Remember, if you like what you hear, just tell a couple of people you know
5433220	5438540	about the show. That's how we will slowly take over the world with our friends at the
5438540	5443420	Voltron of podcasting. That's going to do it. We'll see you next week for the last show
5443420	5448580	on Live 365. Although, honestly, for most of you folks that listen on the podcast forum,
5448580	5452700	you're going to be like, what changed? Not a lot. So that's going to do it, though, for
5452700	5455700	this week. So until next time, we'll see you here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5455700	5464700	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
