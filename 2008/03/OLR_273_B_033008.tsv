487	19074	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19980	23501	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this Part B of our podcast.
44108	50393	Some of the things coming to Xbox Live, like Darwinian, some Ikaruga, and the Penny Arcade game.
50934	53636	Now we're going to get into some Wii news, and we'll start off with Loki.
53956	55938	And also, if you didn't listen to Part A, then you're a witch!
56858	57519	Yes, you're a witch!
58640	59280	Uh, damn you.
59781	63584	Coming to the Wii, and this is, ooh, big shock here.
64425	66086	Rock Band was announced for the Wii.
66426	70750	They're going to be getting the special edition, otherwise known as the one with all the instruments.
71510	73352	And that is coming to, um...
73948	77911	Retailers June 22nd for the small sum of $170.
79472	81473	Yes, that's almost the price of a Wii console.
82494	86597	And, of course, there are a few things you should know about it.
86997	89419	For one, the drum is white.
91340	94923	And number two, it's going to contain five bonus songs.
95964	100767	That's only because there are absolutely no downloads for this.
101347	102268	Wah, wah.
102688	103509	Yeah, so...
104502	105003	PlaySation 2
126694	131318	and it will come with a powered USB hub, much like the Xbox 360 release.
131918	137943	Did you really, I mean, honestly, people out there, did you really think that Rock Band on the Wii was going to have download content?
138363	139504	I mean, did you really think that?
139624	141305	Because where would they put it?
142846	143247	Seriously.
143587	149731	The only other thing they could do is already have it on the disc and then you, you know, download little unlock codes, but that would piss people off even more.
149751	151192	Yeah, it would piss people off.
151653	155696	The thing I would, I don't know, maybe download it to SD memory cards.
157435	172498	Really, I think that's what it's going to take, you know, somehow make your own file formats, because I know that Nintendo has their stupid block set up for game saves and stuff like that, but it doesn't necessarily mean programs have to use that.
172558	175338	I mean, if you look at it, you know, Smash Bros.
175378	186720	has its own save data, you know, Excite Truck and Endless Ocean use MP3s, so who's to say that you couldn't make some sort of, like,
187793	189434	Dream on on all that stuff, by the way.
189454	189915	Just dream on.
189935	190015	Oh.
216107	217948	I'm sorry, I was choking on toast.
218228	222070	You know, honestly, what my honest reaction though was when I heard that news about Rock Band being on the Wii?
222870	225092	I actually, I was like, I thought it was already on the Wii.
226912	230314	Because seriously, Rock Band's on like every system, just like Guitar Hero and all this.
230334	232755	So I thought Rock Band was already on the Wii.
233316	240499	But I, of course, did not make that my system of choice because I knew it wouldn't have the download songs and I knew it wouldn't be probably quite the graphical quality of the other versions.
240519	242820	I can't wait until they shoehorn it onto the DS.
244261	245782	I'm sure that's just a matter of time, huh?
246374	248635	That would be insane.
248695	250236	It would have to use Wi-Fi, I think.
250576	252116	You could do the drums with the stylus.
252176	252937	Tap, tap, tap, tap.
253197	254037	I guess that would work.
254577	256718	Maybe make use of that Guitar Hero expansion.
257558	258199	Probably not, though.
258539	261100	You would have a separate guitar that wouldn't be compatible with the other one.
261780	262340	Just you wait.
263601	271104	Well, if singing is more your thing, it could be very soon that a SingStar-type clone is coming to the Wii.
271124	272965	It looks like it's called JoySound.
275146	278107	Apparently Hudson is making this game called JoySound.
278968	281729	It's going to be something you can actually get on WiiWare.
282089	289233	You'll download this JoySound thing and you get it from a server that's being exclusively set up for that, whatever that is.
290033	290993	But here's the trick with it.
291314	295536	Instead of having to pay for individual songs, you subscribe to it.
296696	299357	They're hoping to release it this summer in Japan.
299798	304780	It's going to have 20,000 songs available at launch, 1,000 more every month.
305225	312567	If they have that, I'm sorry, but that's sad for SingStar, especially when they're touting that they're going to have this huge long thing.
312767	313768	And Karaoke Revolution.
313948	314948	And Karaoke Revolution.
315108	318869	Well, actually, here's the funny thing.
319009	320289	It's Hudson that's putting it up there.
320370	328412	So imagine, if you will, they could do something like this and brand it with Karaoke Revolution, and boom, there you go.
329332	331893	Bring that over to the U.S.,
333948	339130	But with 20,000 songs, I can't help but think it's just going to be like MIDI songs.
339370	339990	You know what I mean?
340150	342871	It's like the quality of the songs is going to be really crap.
343711	344392	You'd be surprised.
344852	347113	MP3s, I mean, they could do it that way.
347133	349373	I mean, that wouldn't be that hard.
352074	352975	But I don't know.
353655	356796	I actually think it's kind of a neat setup and it's a different way of trying to do things.
357376	359117	Again, it all depends on price.
360080	360880	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
391192	393634	I remember Iridium very vaguely, but I did play that.
422188	423829	You're fighting aliens and stuff.
423889	430693	And it apparently has elements from Gradius and Defender and a few others that are on there.
430753	433434	But it's actually 500 Wii points.
434075	439618	And before I forget to mention, International Karate is also 500 Wii points.
439638	443500	I'm really curious how those Commodore 64 games are going to translate over on the Wii.
443680	444780	I'm really curious to check that out.
445421	449183	Well, the other game that is out is Cruisin' U.S.A.,
449881	453887	It was a Nintendo 64 game for a thousand Wii points.
455229	457772	And, well, it's Cruisin' USA.
457872	464101	It probably still controls just as badly, and it's still just as weird as it was before.
464462	465423	Well, was it Cruisin' USA?
465443	465623	Yeah.
467264	470165	I'm trying to remember Cruisin' USA on Nintendo 64.
470285	471666	I don't remember it was very good.
471686	472006	No.
472066	475508	GS68 says I wouldn't buy Cruisin' USA for even 100 Wii Points.
475808	480070	Actually, no, I'm thinking, I'm sorry, I'm thinking of Rush the Rock.
480730	481490	Rush the Rock was okay.
481510	483951	They had that on Nintendo 64, and no, that wasn't very good.
485312	488313	Cruisin' USA, no, that probably wasn't very good either.
488353	490234	Cruisin' World was a lot better.
490694	492655	California Speed, not very good either.
493516	496257	In fact, all the games made by Midway that were racing...
497349	497789	Not very good.
498389	499089	Hydro Thunder.
499510	500330	I love Hydro Thunder.
500470	501350	The Thunder games are good.
501510	504351	Hydro Thunder was brilliant.
504731	506471	Especially on Dreamcast.
506511	507772	I can only play that game in the arcades.
507932	508612	I can't play it on console.
508632	508872	No way.
508952	510532	We had it on Dreamcast.
510652	511232	No way way.
512853	514453	I'll tell you what, it sucked on PlayStation.
515373	516814	It sucked ass on PlayStation.
518694	520015	That's it.
520295	525816	In Japan, you're going to be able to get one of the games that Jamie's been super excited about for a while.
526603	531505	Rondo of Blood or Dracula X Rondo of Blood is coming to the Japanese Virtual Console.
531545	534187	Yes, that is the Turbo Duo version.
535227	540029	No word on how much it's going to cost you, but I mean, hey, that's pretty awesome.
540489	550434	And unfortunately, I don't think we're going to see it come over here because that would mean it would need to be localized and no one wants to spend any time on something like that.
551614	555016	But if you can play the Japanese version, awesome!
556328	560469	Well, all the cutscenes had a text on them.
560489	563130	All they'd have to do is just translate the text and not worry about the dialogue.
564570	573353	Well, that's still effort, and you remember they don't want to put effort into these games.
573393	576794	That is true.
576974	581655	It is true, and so that wouldn't be that hard, but once again, it takes a little bit of effort to change all the text.
581695	583936	Well, isn't the PSP version all graphiced up, too?
583976	584276	It's all...
585114	587895	Yes, but don't they have the original one on there too?
587915	588435	Yes, they do.
588836	589116	Oh, okay.
589176	590356	I mean, yeah.
590376	590636	Do they?
590656	591056	I don't know.
592997	595578	But they have, I think the original one, wasn't it Dracula X?
597339	605722	I mean, it's not the new Rondo, or the... Yeah, while these guys get Dracula X Rondo of Blood, you know what we'll get on US Virtual Console?
605882	606783	The stupid, crappy...
608854	609634	Pooh version.
609734	613715	No, it came out over here as Dracula X on Super Nintendo.
614035	622277	I thought it was our Castlevania V. No, because the Dracula X series doesn't necessarily fall in with the actual Castlevania.
622297	625378	Only there was a Castlevania V. No, there was a Castlevania V, I swear to God.
625638	635741	We did get a Castlevania V, but it wasn't Dracula X. Castlevania V, in fact, I do believe it was re-released with the Castlevania Chronicles.
636874	643598	But I'm fairly positive that it was not Dracula X. Then you're right.
643618	644198	I must be crazy.
644218	646140	I could have sworn it was Castlevania V we got here.
649021	649241	Huh.
649562	652223	Because there was Super Castlevania IV and I don't remember what after that.
652263	654785	I think Castlevania V came out on PlayStation if I'm remembering right.
659307	659708	Or no.
660428	661069	No, Castlevania 64. 64.
663566	664487	That does not exist.
664647	665528	I'm just crazy.
665608	666009	It's fine.
666049	666770	It's not worth it.
666790	667951	Castlevania 64 does not exist.
668151	669392	It's not worth losing sleep over.
669412	671535	It does not exist to you.
671755	672296	It's dead to you.
672476	672876	Dead to me.
672956	679764	And to DarkTetsuya, technically Dracula XX was Nocturne in the Moonlight, which we got over here as Symphony of the Night.
682071	689095	Alright, well, some other systems games are making its way to the Virtual Console on the Nintendo Wii very soon.
689135	694077	It's the Sega Master System, and we mentioned this a couple shows ago, but now it is official.
694137	705143	They are making their way to the North American Virtual Console, and they're going to cost 400 points a game, so it makes it the cheapest system of any of them out there, because it's only going to be 4 bucks a game.
705163	706544	The NES games are 5 bucks a pop.
707696	715461	Two of the first games that are going to be coming out that should be out soon, that probably means any week now, Wonder Boy and Fantasy Zone are going to be the first two that come out.
715501	717982	Fantasy Zone, of course, was one of the classic games of the week.
718223	718683	That's right.
718703	720324	Well, Fantasy Zone's a good game, too.
720784	728489	I mean, I don't know if the Sega Master System port of it's my favorite, but, you know, it is, for four bucks, probably not a bad deal.
729509	733692	So, we'll see what other types of Sega Master System games show up very soon.
734532	735433	I need to correct myself.
735693	735913	Go ahead.
736720	737901	Symphony of the Night was X2.
738281	741203	XX was the Super Nintendo release in Japan.
742784	743444	Too confusing.
744485	748087	Damn them for releasing completely different games over here in the US than they did over there.
748147	748567	You know what I mean?
749208	749608	Damn them.
750649	751229	Damn the man.
751589	752790	They just should have brought it out over here.
752850	755412	It was so... Well, I've had it on this show before.
755672	757673	We hooked it up through the old setup.
758293	759654	Oh, very few people remember that.
759674	760335	That was years ago.
760355	762376	And did screen captures and everything through the webcam.
763056	765958	And it was the whole German intro and everything.
766357	770018	Anyway, I like fantasy, by the way.
771178	778039	So, another wonderful, wonderful game is going to be remade for WiiWare.
778459	779319	That's pretty cool.
779919	787661	And that is going to be one of the best pinball simulating games ever is Alien Crush.
789541	795022	And you can actually download Alien Crush right now and play it on virtual console.
795954	798915	But it's really, really, really happy.
799696	802737	So far, there's only, of course, note for it being out in Japan.
803397	804258	But we could get it.
804618	807279	I really hope that we do, because hopefully Hudson loves us.
809280	811581	Although, honestly, I would prefer to have Devil's Crush myself.
815242	819224	What happens to... Because I have the original Alien Crush, so I guess I'm just going to have to have two.
821485	824246	What I'm understanding from this screen capture I'm seeing on here...
824798	831760	is that instead of the top-down view, you actually have a slightly more diagonal overhead.
832080	837042	Kind of like more traditional, or I shouldn't say more traditional, more newer.
838122	839063	You know what I mean?
839383	840343	Rob, our speak grammar good.
840363	840623	Shut up.
841304	845025	The current types of pinball games look like this.
845045	847986	You're looking at it from an angled view, like you would be more accurately.
848026	848866	Like an actual table.
849106	851567	Yeah, it's more of an actual table layout.
852677	856500	but Alien Crush is still pretty sexy.
856540	858962	He played a whole crap load of Alien Crush.
858982	861684	Oh my god, I think he played that game for an entire day once.
862244	868589	And I still meant to bring over my Turbo Duo so he could play Devil's Crush at the time, but now it's out.
869490	872452	Yeah, and now he's not my roommate anymore, so, tear.
872892	877736	Maybe he'll get a Wii at some point, though, and buy the game to relive those memories all over again.
878417	878737	We'll see.
879073	886956	Unfortunately, one thing he's not going to have made available to him is one of the brand new features to Club Nintendo.
887776	896639	That is a memory card that you can get, an SD memory card, 128 megs worth of music from different Nintendo games.
896979	908123	And some of the songs that they have on there, of course, songs from Super Mario Sunshine, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Catch Touch Yoshi, that's kind of a weird name,
908801	935699	Nintendogs, Mario Kart Double Dash, Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker, Pikmin 2 and Super Mario Brothers and of course Club Nintendo is exclusively Japanese and they get all sorts of cool stuff including classic controllers that look like Super Famicom controllers and DS games for the Game & Watch stuff and that stupid Tingle balloon fight game
936838	938599	So this is an official Nintendo product.
938979	939159	Yes.
939379	941640	Yet we know Nintendo kind of hates the SD card.
941680	943120	So this thing is so weird to me.
943220	944640	I wouldn't say they hate the SD card.
944660	947581	I mean, they put damn SD... But they just use it for the weirdest stuff.
947641	948242	You know what I mean?
948302	952323	Like, the most obvious things, like extra storage, they don't use it for.
952423	956844	But this... I mean, like... What would you really use this on?
956904	957704	Like, custom songs?
957724	960605	So you can play these songs in Excite Truck.
960685	961206	Whoopee!
961926	963646	How many people remember Excite Truck?
963726	964386	You and who else?
964607	964767	Me!
964927	965427	And who else?
965487	965807	Nelly!
967367	968728	KU, your wife, and who else?
970049	970349	Fine.
971049	975472	Hey, I can't help it if Excite Truck is the greatest racing game on the Wii.
976292	976592	Ever.
977433	978633	Until Excite Truck 2 comes out.
979454	980074	Please, Nintendo.
980774	981695	Sooner than later.
984356	987958	Alright, well guess what kind of story I've got for you guys right now.
992641	996063	That's right, when you hear that music, you know something really tragic has happened.
997518	1000721	And that is that another person has been killed over video games.
1001441	1003403	Or at least that's what the media wants you to believe.
1004784	1016254	A 15-year-old boy was killed by his 18-year-old friend William Suarez because he refused to hand over the video game he was playing.
1018149	1020051	So what did Suarez do?
1020151	1027140	He whipped out a .32 caliber Smith & Wesson from his waistband, not Mommy and Daddy's closet, not under the bed.
1027480	1031405	He whipped it out from his waistband and shot his 15-year-old friend in the head.
1034709	1035710	What is this world coming to?
1037590	1041492	The killer is 18 years old.
1041852	1050235	He's been charged with manslaughter, illegal possession of a firearm, assault with a dangerous weapon, and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of the dwelling.
1050255	1051075	Why manslaughter?
1051355	1055276	I mean, I would think murder, if anything, because he intended to kill him.
1055636	1059178	How about a bullet wound to the head?
1059218	1060218	That'll scare him.
1060298	1061238	Just give him the chair.
1061858	1063219	Just give him the chair already.
1065069	1073753	A quote from the article, witnesses told authorities that Suarez then put the gun down on the kitchen counter and began saying, this just didn't happen.
1075794	1078575	So kind of like he went crazy or something, I don't know.
1078935	1083657	Now, here's the question, did video games really have anything to do with this?
1084698	1086239	Not really, no.
1087419	1090060	But yet, here are the headlines that are coming out.
1090621	1093582	Family, game led to teen's murder.
1094730	1097631	Video game linked to fatal shooting in Brockton.
1099552	1102473	More like Psycho killed Kid.
1103693	1104253	End of story.
1105634	1105914	It's sad.
1105934	1108955	It'd be the same thing as if he had a Furby a few years ago.
1109935	1113717	Or a Tickle Me Elmo or whatever the fuck it was called.
1113757	1115057	You know what they need to do to this kid?
1116598	1117598	You have to burn him.
1117698	1118458	Because he's a witch!
1120939	1123080	No, he's much, much worse than that.
1125457	1126638	Being a witch is not bad.
1127698	1129339	Being a psycho murderer is.
1133161	1139104	You see, I thought he had two lives and so that's why I didn't know he would be dead forever.
1144747	1146648	Thank you News Media, by the way, for...
1147964	1150045	I'm blowing this story completely out of proportion.
1178237	1179877	Bitch, come back on Imagine Babies.
1180238	1180538	Alright.
1182658	1183298	It's not funny.
1183338	1184639	I'm not laughing at that, I swear.
1185319	1185659	Alright.
1185959	1186919	No, it really isn't funny.
1187539	1187859	You know what?
1187939	1188720	It's not funny.
1188900	1189360	I don't know.
1192181	1192561	It's sick.
1194641	1195761	And it makes me angsty.
1196442	1197842	You know after those types of stories.
1197862	1199562	You know this part of the show is coming up.
1200783	1201643	The F-Use of the Week.
1218490	1219471	And an F you to the ferret?
1219771	1223173	The ferret had to get a few things out from being stuck in your closet for how long?
1224454	1231740	F you to... Well, I don't really want to say F you to California Burger because really all I wanted was the pastrami.
1232500	1234982	But they didn't give me the burger that was supposed to go with the pastrami.
1235622	1236963	And I feel deprived of meat.
1238024	1239385	So F you to that.
1240246	1246390	And F you to my lack of fundage for the presents.
1248143	1250044	A big FU poopy ball to that.
1251304	1251765	FU to money.
1252585	1254666	Well, I mean, money is just FU to lack of money.
1255046	1255406	Yeah.
1256006	1256327	Loki.
1256907	1268992	FU to people who drive big trucks that can't figure out where in the lane they're supposed to be because, you know, for some reason when people need to make a left turn, they start heading towards the right and cutting into my lane and then they make their left turn because their truck's too big.
1270233	1271773	It's not my fault you bought a big truck.
1271793	1273114	It doesn't mean you have to run me off the road.
1275681	1287925	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm about to enter my fourth week of having pains that float around my abdomen, my back, my stomach, and no one knows what's wrong with me still.
1289766	1290906	I had a blood test on Tuesday.
1290946	1291987	I'm still waiting on the results.
1292007	1293767	I'm going for Alien Chess Popper.
1294467	1295148	God, I hope not.
1296288	1297428	Although I guess that would be kind of cool.
1297448	1300449	I mean, if I'm going to go, let's go out with a bang like that.
1300469	1301170	Why not, huh?
1301870	1302030	But
1303393	1304174	Did you have the special?
1304194	1305034	Did you have the special?
1305174	1305394	Well, um...
1323050	1324991	This might still make people angsty.
1325131	1327392	Sorry, but I didn't make it.
1327732	1336595	GameStop is not going to be carrying Game Boy and Game Boy Color stuff, games, systems, crap that goes with it.
1337536	1339537	Hoping to have it all wiped out by the end of April.
1339817	1341737	I didn't know they were still carrying Game Boy.
1341757	1342178	Yeah, I know.
1343538	1344519	I'm not angsty about it.
1344559	1345759	I'm surprised they still got it.
1346279	1348080	Well, you can always go to GameCrazy for that stuff.
1349470	1352272	or playing trade or any other mom and pops out there.
1352452	1355634	Or buy yourself a freaking Game Boy Advance and get with the times already.
1355714	1356195	Jesus.
1356615	1361418	But there were some really, really good games that were old Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.
1361478	1365100	But those old games will work on the Game Boy Advance.
1365480	1365881	They will.
1366201	1371304	But if they're not going to be selling the games, you have to go to the little trader places.
1371744	1372125	All right.
1372185	1372585	Fair enough.
1373226	1376068	And yet, I do have to admit, one of the cutest Game Boys I ever had.
1376108	1377508	I don't know why I gave it to my sister.
1377528	1379189	That was the stupidest thing I ever did.
1379629	1385212	But I had a Game Boy Color that when you turned it on, it had a little Pikachu around the power thing.
1385272	1387914	And so it looked like his cheeks lit up because the power was on.
1388894	1391476	Maybe it was Pichu, not Pikachu, but you know what I mean.
1391716	1394878	I had a pink Game Boy Advance.
1395298	1396038	How girly.
1396578	1399020	And this is me who isn't like the uber girly girl.
1399080	1399320	I just...
1400071	1401431	I wanted a pink one.
1401511	1403072	I think I wanted them because they were hard to get.
1403392	1405712	Mine was clear and has no backlight.
1407993	1409013	We put a backlight in mine.
1409853	1415435	I had to use those stupid little reading light things that would clip to the top so you could actually see the screen.
1416815	1417815	Ah, Nintendo.
1418035	1419856	I had a friend put an afterburner in mine.
1422076	1424857	I think you're just happy about having a chance to take apart something technological.
1426482	1436167	Well, you may not be able to get Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but one game you will be able to get probably pretty soon is the sequel to 50 Cent Bulletproof.
1436427	1437887	Yes, it's a brand new game.
1439028	1443650	50 Cent to Blood in the Sand.
1444670	1447452	And my god, is it shit.
1447612	1450173	It's basically, if I remember the premise of it correct,
1451526	1471649	Fitty goes to the Middle East to perform for somebody and the promoter doesn't have the money to pay him so instead of paying him money he pays him in a diamond encrusted skull which gets stolen by I can only assume terrorists and then it's up to Fitty to get the skull back.
1473621	1476122	DarkTetsuya says, please tell me this is an early April Fool's Day joke.
1476162	1476842	I'm afraid it's not.
1476862	1478562	I almost kind of want to agree.
1501805	1502425	I don't know, though.
1502725	1508948	You do bring up an interesting point, Loki, is that if it's almost like self-parody or something, it's actually kind of funny.
1509488	1510828	But I don't think it is.
1510988	1514950	I think he's trying to make it out like, dude, it's 50 Cent fighting terrorists.
1515790	1517571	How much more American do you need?
1517631	1520372	I mean, he shits red, white, and blue.
1520452	1521792	That's how American it is.
1522292	1525253	It's like, you know, no more taking on gangbangers.
1525393	1528774	It's now time to take on terrorists.
1529555	1530415	Hurrah.
1530970	1531691	Yeah, I don't know.
1531811	1535053	It's... And people will buy it!
1536074	1545121	I mean, the first thing I thought of when I heard there was a sequel to this game is I thought, you mean Bulletproof 1 sold enough copies to necessitate this?
1546702	1547643	What the hell?
1549164	1554248	Yeah, I just... I wanted to make sure I have the correct, um... What was it?
1554288	1557771	The, uh... The correct name for all this stuff.
1557811	1558192	And I think...
1561068	1566150	I am pretty positive that was the actual plot to this.
1566630	1571532	I wonder if this is trying to be like, you know how some movies are so bad they're actually kind of good, like Showgirls?
1571953	1573953	This is going to be like the Showgirls of video gaming.
1573994	1575394	It's so bad, it's pretty funny.
1575514	1575854	Hey, Rob.
1576114	1576314	What?
1576835	1577655	You are a whore.
1579436	1581197	You made me sit down and watch that movie and I love it.
1581237	1582777	Because it's awesome.
1583017	1589100	I guess Bulletproof sold, it was a multi-million dollar, or multi-million copy selling game.
1590689	1592511	I don't remember it selling more than one.
1592671	1594913	Who's buying it?
1595193	1596535	I don't know.
1596655	1601439	Blend the Sand is something more exotic, more Hollywood blockbuster.
1601459	1610007	This game sets 50s character against a cabal of international gangsters on a far-flung, bullet-ridden adventure.
1610188	1614732	It's inspired by Three Kings meets Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.
1615464	1616805	It's definitely a crime story.
1618926	1630613	The developer credited 50 with pushing the game's creators to consider novel locations and said that MC played a big part in crafting the game's still-secret story.
1635075	1635475	I don't know.
1635976	1641819	And I guess the game will run on the Unreal 3 engine because every other fucking game on the face of the earth runs on the...
1642895	1643175	I don't know.
1643195	1643795	It's interesting.
1667355	1671216	There's not a lot of games out there for the urban market and stuff like this does do really well actually so it's just crazy.
1695316	1696096	Even this?
1696557	1697137	Even this?
1697437	1698237	But here's the thing, though.
1698277	1705421	I mean, it sounds like that they're actually putting some effort into the game because, I mean, the first one was pretty cinematic.
1705561	1706701	It was just kind of retarded.
1707121	1712044	But this one, you know, being that it's on the Unreal 3 engine and stuff like that, I mean, I don't know.
1712064	1713004	I have to see how it looks.
1713084	1714685	But, yeah, the whole thing sounds ridiculous.
1715485	1715806	All right.
1716386	1716766	We'll see.
1718442	1719423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1738065	1738646	and DarkSakura.com.
1760326	1761406	as the months will go on.
1761486	1762107	So who knows?
1762407	1764087	But I imagine the shirts will be more expensive.
1764367	1765968	They should try GameStop.
1766108	1770809	I mean, I know I hate to push GameStop, but I mean... Or other game box stores.
1770829	1771849	Yeah, gaming chains.
1771869	1772669	That would be perfect.
1773430	1778851	Or, I don't know, allow them to be purchased on their website from independent retailers out there.
1778871	1781232	That would be the way to do it, I would think.
1781952	1782192	All right.
1782816	1783176	No, only a few.
1783196	1783456	Depressing.
1810376	1812859	Wow, hey, we got some spam in the interim as well.
1813219	1813799	Hooray.
1814080	1815101	And another couple emails.
1815141	1819745	So actually, I might just be generous and read the two new ones that came in as well.
1820686	1823469	So starting off, this one says, Hi, all.
1824378	1830363	First, sorry for not contacting you before, but I've been listening to your show via iTunes podcasts for about 18 months.
1830743	1831784	Big fan of DarkSakura.
1831884	1832364	Oh, thank you.
1833365	1835227	And wouldn't like to miss hearing her every week.
1835647	1836508	Aw, thank you.
1837629	1851900	So on that note, have you ever looked into using, I guess it's ustream.tv, stickcam.com with chat, plus storage for shows and have been used by Leo Laporte for TWIT TV?
1852780	1853461	This week in tech.
1854011	1855252	Yeah, okay.
1855432	1861594	Well, basically, it lists a whole bunch of other things, but as we've announced earlier in the show, we've got our plan.
1862555	1867937	Yes, and Ustream TV, actually, we actually have a channel on Ustream TV, we just never used it.
1869159	1871480	Actually, we were originally going to go with Ustream TV.
1871520	1873820	We made a last-minute decision to switch to Justin TV.
1873860	1877101	That was after the Operator 11 fallout because I remember we were using them for a little while.
1877581	1881002	So I'd actually created the Ustream TV account with the intention of going over there.
1881022	1881402	But I don't know.
1881422	1884143	There was something about Justin TV I just liked a little better.
1884323	1891444	Oh, I think I like the way that fans could go in and cut out the highlight clips and you could upload things to YouTube and import things from YouTube.
1891824	1894005	I felt Justin TV had a little more of the functionality.
1894045	1898086	And Ustream seemed a little too big for me.
1898430	1898790	for me.
1898970	1899711	You know what I mean?
1899731	1901131	This is a lot more interactive, I think.
1901272	1902932	Yeah, I like Justin TV a little more.
1902952	1904033	We prefer cozy.
1904313	1905214	Yeah, it's a little more cozy.
1906294	1906674	I like that.
1907235	1919981	Well, just to continue with the email, also TalkShoe.com does a live audio broadcast with chat room, but it needs to be downloaded first order to use the live server, and you can also record the shows as you do them, which are available in the show archive.
1920122	1920782	I hope that helps.
1920942	1922823	If not, sorry and hope you find a solution soon.
1923243	1924364	All the best, Steve in the UK.
1925578	1928460	Well, hopefully you'll be pleased with the earlier news about our solution.
1928500	1929521	We're pretty excited about it.
1929581	1930162	Voltron!
1930202	1933024	Which is pretty much sort of what we had kind of thought already.
1934765	1936127	Next email.
1937307	1938528	Hello, gentlemen and lady.
1938849	1940390	I just watched Dead Fantasy 2.
1941611	1944773	I know you guys have seen the first one.
1944894	1946255	It's nothing compared to the second.
1946875	1949737	I just think that it's amazing that someone could do this in their spare time.
1950198	1953240	I've looked at it several times now and can't help but wonder what DarkSakura thought.
1953300	1954021	Well, I haven't seen it yet.
1955054	1957256	I know she loves her fighting games in Final Fantasy.
1957956	1963680	Monty Ohm has said that there are at least five more in the series.
1963720	1967642	I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but I've got a few questions.
1967662	1971344	With the latest surprising characters, who do you think might make an appearance next?
1971464	1973646	And finally, which side will win in the end?
1973726	1977508	Seems the Final Fantasy team has an unfair advantage by using both weapons and magic.
1978149	1979530	I'll be surprised if they win, though.
1979891	1985035	Lastly, I don't have the time to listen to the show live, but I've always downloaded the podcast.
1985075	1988998	It seems that there are always regular live listeners to support the show.
1989038	1992702	If you guys can find a suitable alternative to Live 365, then how about a fundraiser?
1993302	2000929	I know it sounds a bit corny, but I've come to like the show very much and would hate to see any changes that would cripple the community that has grown around it.
2001669	2002810	I would be... I'll...
2005262	2010165	I'd be more than willing to donate money to keep the show going, and I'm sure most of the live listeners would as well.
2010625	2012026	Thanks for getting me through a rough day.
2012106	2013207	It's from Recymo.
2013307	2024074	And to be honest, we disagree with what Live 365 is doing, and it's more or less the point that we don't want to support what they're doing, no matter if we can afford it or not.
2025234	2025415	Right?
2025575	2026855	Whoa, the FU music came in there.
2026915	2027536	Sorry about that.
2027556	2028917	I was like, where the hell is that music going?
2028937	2030137	Yeah, it's appropriate, so it's alright.
2030838	2030878	Um...
2031721	2034123	You know, again, thank you for the wonderful offer.
2034303	2038346	But, you know, we have another plan that we think will help actually grow our community a little bit.
2038386	2047252	By the way, Jamie, here's a little sneak peek of Dead Fantasy 2, which shows the... It's basically... I did watch some of it.
2047812	2052536	I mean, it's just one giant fanboy orgasm in real form.
2053176	2054177	It's... What is it?
2054237	2058320	I mean, it's just special effect after special effect after...
2059076	2060598	I think I'm going to watch that one again.
2060618	2062000	I see dead or alive people.
2075936	2079537	Yeah, well, it's Dead or Alive characters versus Final Fantasy.
2079617	2082718	It's just one giant fanboy orgasm.
2082958	2083759	It's crazy.
2084299	2086039	Riku just got thrown in that clip there.
2086059	2086640	That's lovely.
2087060	2090381	Anyway, sorry, I know that makes for horrible radio, but I wanted to show Jamie a little clip of that.
2090441	2091901	That's completely awesome.
2092982	2101825	And we got an email from HeroAntagonist, which was a link, and it said, this seemed like something you'd want to see if you haven't already.
2102065	2105426	It's like a bizarre twist between DDR Beatmania and a slot machine.
2105771	2109795	I have something for him, that is, if he's still listening to the show.
2109995	2116301	I'm not sure if you've seen this yet, but on YouTube there's a blind gamer who goes by the nickname
2132478	2141761	Geniuses Corruption, who has played through Zelda Ocarina of Time, Zelda Twilight Princess, and Castlevania Circle of the Moon, and posted videos of his conquests.
2141801	2142761	You can see his page.
2143222	2147143	It's, again, Geniuses Corruption, geniuses being plural.
2148051	2156496	Given that he has proven he is blind through the front page video of him beating a boss blindfolded, it just goes to show that even blind gamers can play video games.
2156636	2158697	To Ranma of India, you are not alone.
2158737	2163039	There are other gamers out there who were born blind and they play video games, so can you.
2163919	2164700	That's from GS68.
2164760	2166101	I watched it.
2166141	2167041	It was actually pretty cool.
2167841	2170923	The game he was playing in... Oh, crap.
2171063	2171843	I lost the link.
2172584	2172704	Oh...
2173942	2174763	I closed it, sorry.
2175203	2179827	But he was playing through a GameCube game and doing fairly decently.
2180527	2186752	Cheeseburger sent us a giant ASCII finger that says to live 365.
2188654	2189435	Thank you, Cheeseburger.
2190255	2191737	That was very nice ASCII art.
2191977	2193018	I was very impressed.
2193678	2197121	J-Rod emailed one of the two that we got recently.
2197944	2200627	Hi OLR crew, love the show, keep up the awesome job.
2200667	2209195	What I was writing about was concerning deeper characters and themes in video games and how long you think it will be before we actually start seeing this type of stuff in games.
2209575	2215041	We are recently seeing a much greater character portrayal and writing with emotions like love with games like Mass Effect and others.
2215661	2226909	I would like to see deep and mature storylines involving other things and emotions that are quote too hot for video games to deal with like racism, sexism, homosexuality and various other things.
2227009	2234154	American History X and Schindler's List are very powerful and well done films that deal with very mature subjects and are in good taste.
2234595	2244202	It seems like companies such as Rockstar putting out games like Manhunt are actually setting us backwards when it comes to being taken seriously compared to other forms of entertainment like movies and books.
2244842	2250085	And this is this email sponsored by Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.
2250105	2250446	Of course.
2265595	2267196	That's a really good thought.
2267896	2269517	Japanese games have been doing it for a while.
2269537	2271258	I would love to play these types of games.
2271298	2272539	I think it would be a lot of fun.
2272879	2279062	Unfortunately, you only really see it in the occasional role-playing game that has the more mature themes, but I think it would be fun.
2279443	2283205	I just don't think they'd sell well is the unfortunate thing.
2283485	2290809	In Hollywood, you can make a big budget movie, lots of special effects and explosions.
2290829	2294391	You can make a big budget movie, or you can make a small budget movie that costs a lot less to make.
2294946	2295426	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2315701	2324868	A, doesn't get a lot of exposure, and B, usually the indie stuff is innovating on different types of gameplay, not necessarily new themes in game formats that we've already seen, if that makes sense.
2325409	2332114	Because when you talk about exploring those types of themes, well, you can't really do a lot of that in a puzzle game.
2332695	2339220	You're talking about types of games that are really involved with story, so that's basically RPG and those types of games.
2339601	2342103	You don't see a lot of really...
2343607	2346729	polished indie efforts in those realms, if that makes sense.
2347670	2349011	So I think that's why you're right.
2349071	2351293	It's going to be a long time, unfortunately, before we see something like this.
2351613	2361960	And what it's going to take is it's going to take video games getting even bigger and bigger so that more and more money and there's more budgets for different types of experiments and try things.
2362961	2365983	But I think it would be great to have some of those things you mentioned.
2369185	2373088	Well, like I said, quite a few games have come out overseas that
2373895	2376376	dealt with deeper topics, but we won't get them over here.
2379016	2385657	Last email from Mr. D. Big wave from across the pond to Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.
2385778	2390178	I'm a UK listener who occasionally listens live and am as I write this.
2390358	2390699	Oh, cool.
2390719	2390919	Hi.
2392359	2395560	Yeah, I must be crazy since the show starts about 1 to 2 a.m.
2395620	2402061	here, but I often find myself not getting a lot of sleep during the early hours of Monday morning due to having frequent uni deadlines.
2402161	2402721	Oh, I'm sorry.
2403379	2405160	Your show keeps me going, so thanks.
2405660	2412303	Anyway, DarkSakura's talk of Grandia reminded me of something I've been thinking about previously, memorable RPG moments.
2412783	2415504	My memory of... Damn, that was fast.
2416025	2418246	I mean, you just brought up Grandia like an hour ago.
2418746	2420027	That's instant gratification.
2420067	2420527	There you go.
2420567	2421007	All right, sorry.
2421533	2429261	My memory of Grandia is really patchy, and I found the crossing of the wall that marks the end of the world to be very memorable.
2429721	2431944	What are your most memorable RPG scenes?
2432524	2433825	To stop right there...
2434813	2435913	That's one of them.
2436093	2442195	Actually, the whole ghost ship part in Grandia I thought was really just awesome.
2442515	2445336	I hate to be cliche, but come on.
2445436	2455438	The whole, you know who... Well, the opera in 6, but the you know who dies in Final Fantasy 7 was really emotional and a really big step in games at that time.
2455478	2457999	I hate to be cliche, but that really is the one that comes to mind.
2458019	2459319	It was really emotional for me too, Rob.
2459719	2461099	You emotionally overjoyed.
2461119	2463160	I cheered so loudly, and I was like, yes!
2464349	2477633	and I still to this day have my card with the stupid Hobag's death saved on it because I laughed my ass off and I spent the whole time screaming at Jenova so I can get to that part and watch the death.
2478920	2483964	I'll give an answer that maybe the guy wasn't looking for, but I'll kind of take it in a different direction.
2484084	2486406	I'm going to say games like World of Warcraft.
2487166	2491669	When you do things with your guild, like for instance, I have a guild of mostly people I know offline.
2491990	2495012	We have maybe a handful of OLR listeners in there, but not a few.
2495052	2497894	Even though I've plugged it like a million times, I guess you all don't want to play WoW with us.
2497914	2498334	That's fine.
2498595	2499035	See if I care.
2499495	2507218	But no, we have this guild on there and we're currently raiding Karazhan because we finally have enough people who are level 70 to start doing some of the 10-man raids.
2507758	2519683	And I'll tell you what, when we finally get the strategy down to beat one of the bosses, such as Maiden of Virtue, was one of those bosses where like the first couple times we went in there and did it, oh my god, she was so tough.
2519943	2522024	But then we were finally able to overcome that and beat her.
2522084	2525745	We were like so happy and like so excited because we really accomplished something, you know.
2526195	2529156	I mean, not like, oh my gosh, I'm going to run out naked through the streets.
2529176	2529656	I'm so happy.
2529716	2533897	But there definitely is that emotion of, hey, look, we accomplished this together.
2533917	2534518	That's pretty rad.
2538679	2539499	Yeah, I guess.
2540419	2540699	I don't know.
2540760	2542760	Just kind of a different type of answer.
2542880	2548622	Not necessarily a scripted thing, but working together towards a common goal.
2549362	2552403	I still laughed my ass off in Final Fantasy VII, by the way.
2553784	2554124	Do you?
2554984	2555364	I laughed.
2556986	2583831	to continue with the email personally mine are the Bridge Battle and Shining Force Escaping Midgar in Final Fantasy 7 and the aforementioned Wall at the End of the World in Grandia the Shining Force thing probably doesn't seem all that interesting to most people but that was my first RPG at age 6 in 1993 oh I feel old so it's got a special place in my heart speaking of sentimental games it'd also be cool to know what games are particularly special to you and why keep up the great show Mr. D
2585490	2600703	As far as games that are special to me, Super Street Fighter 2 on Super Nintendo because it was my very first Super Nintendo game that was mine and not my brother's on my Nintendo system.
2601104	2601564	Mine.
2602725	2603065	Me.
2604066	2604787	It belonged to me.
2604807	2607049	Special games...
2610808	2611428	I don't know.
2611529	2615291	I can't think of a whole lot that, like, Super Metroid, I suppose, would be one.
2616652	2618753	Just because I think it's the really greatest game ever.
2619534	2629780	I would have to, maybe I would go all the way back to the Atari 2600 and say things like Spider-Man, because those are some of my earliest gaming memories right there, so those games are definitely special.
2630140	2640187	I have, you know, sorry, this really makes me feel old, but I remember being, you know, little, like a first grader,
2640580	2651709	and going next door to my friend's house and playing their Odyssey 2 and playing... I want to say it was like a Lord of the Rings game or something.
2651769	2652370	No, it wasn't.
2653391	2657394	You play either as a fighter, a wizard, a changeling, or something else.
2657454	2659436	And playing... What was that?
2660357	2667002	Casey Munchkin's Crazy Chase that got sued for being like Pac-Man, which I actually still have a copy of it.
2667563	2667823	You know...
2669574	2678907	I guess I kind of have good memories of that, but I also have good memories of playing Kix in elementary school.
2679929	2683273	I'll tell you what game I used to freaking love that's very special to me.
2683654	2686418	It's an old-ass computer game called Rogue.
2687076	2690337	I don't know if you ever played this game, but you control a little happy face looking thing.
2690357	2692738	It was all done in ASCII graphics, but it was an actual game.
2692778	2694258	I think like Epyx or somebody put it out.
2694618	2698979	But you play this little ASCII happy face that went around through these tunnels.
2698999	2700940	You were exploring, you know, like a dungeon.
2701520	2707201	And creatures were giant capital letters that would, like a B for bat would attack you and all this stuff.
2707542	2710402	Sounds like quite a number of the old MUDs I used to have.
2710422	2712983	It was old school, but great.
2713359	2719584	Well, also, I have to say, when I was in second or third grade, we had a Clicca Vision.
2720985	2725709	And for me, it was always playing Venture and Mousetrap, which I suck at Venture now.
2726610	2734476	But, you know, I guess it's like really a lot, because there's certain games that I would be playing at a time that I'd attach to certain things that were going on in my life at the time.
2734976	2737298	And, like, I think it's entirely hilarious.
2737378	2743083	Dan was trying to, I guess, catalog things that had happened in his life
2743895	2748936	and, um, he was doing a lot of it by sort of what he was playing at that time and what grade he was in.
2750316	2757517	I thought that, you know, honestly, that's sort of how I correlate a lot of stuff happens to me too, because I'll remember, oh, this happened, and at the time I was playing this.
2758238	2760838	So, I have that kind of memory attachment, I guess.
2763539	2763899	Alright.
2765079	2766219	Loki, you're awfully quiet.
2766279	2767959	Not a lot of special video games for you?
2768279	2769059	He's looking at porn.
2769200	2771700	I'm not looking at porn, I'm looking at news.
2772170	2773911	Gal's Panic is not a special game to you?
2775191	2775731	It was fun.
2777272	2777592	All right.
2778572	2779252	No more emails?
2780573	2780713	No.
2780793	2781133	That's it?
2781453	2781673	All right.
2781753	2783874	Oh, we have one particular attachment.
2783934	2785894	Remember, our names are attached to.
2787555	2788455	OLR the game.
2789516	2789916	Oh, yeah.
2789936	2790636	The text game.
2790996	2791956	Oh, yes, of course.
2792837	2793417	The OLR text game.
2793437	2794417	Put that on our wiki, people.
2795898	2796278	Where is it?
2796318	2797258	Can you still get a copy of that?
2797318	2798318	It's got to be available somewhere.
2798358	2799699	I think I've got it somewhere.
2799759	2800119	Somewhere.
2800993	2805175	All right, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
2805235	2807437	But we're going to get to the Skype line very soon.
2807477	2808918	We have some gaming news first.
2809738	2811899	Yes.
2812480	2818203	So there was a rumor going around that Def Leppard was going to be in Guitar Hero 4.
2818823	2823306	And it actually ended up turning out that wasn't exactly true.
2823666	2827448	It was during an interview with the band on the radio show Rock Align.
2827981	2832284	And I guess Caller asked why none of their songs have been featured in Guitar Hero or Rockman.
2832824	2840029	And of course, their guitarist, Phil Cullen, replied, revealing at least three of their hits would be featured in Guitar Hero 4.
2840550	2844352	Rock of Ages, Animal, and, of course, Photograph.
2845093	2848656	The problem is, though, it actually isn't going to be featured in Guitar Hero 4.
2848736	2849316	He was wrong.
2849476	2853279	It's actually download content that's going to be coming out soon for Guitar Hero 3.
2853839	2854199	Oh, nice.
2854440	2854780	So...
2856315	2860316	There will be Def Leppard songs, just not in Guitar Hero 4, at least not those songs.
2860616	2861737	There will be Def Leppard.
2864557	2865257	That's going to be fun.
2865978	2871719	Well, you know, I was thinking, we just had a story a couple weeks ago that really made us think that arcades were dying.
2871739	2876260	I mean, we kind of already kind of knew that sadly arcades are dying and they're just not what they used to be.
2876921	2884423	And, you know, I think we had another story about, didn't we have the story last week about Namco's doing something with the Wii in their arcades or something, trying to like integrate all that stuff?
2884443	2885423	Yeah, we talked about it last week.
2885963	2904651	I guess somebody else has faith in arcade games because apparently Signature Devices, they're hardware and software developers, they have sent word out that they are putting final touches on a new four-player arcade game that will, quote, include several well-known comic book and television superheroes.
2905311	2908172	As to who those are, that's still a mystery.
2908472	2909192	Could be anything.
2909272	2915495	I mean, it could literally be anything from the Marvel DC world all the way to heroes from NBC, although I kind of doubt that.
2917489	2937710	I guess it's kind of interesting that all hope is not dead yet for arcades and depending on what names are attached to this game because you know well known quote unquote you know that could be Dora the Explorer as a hero to some and I don't know if that's going to be the one that gets people to come back so hopefully it's the right thing we'll hopefully get more information on that in the coming weeks
2941041	2942962	Well, how about some other news then?
2943362	2943662	Alrighty.
2944002	2944583	Capcom!
2945143	2946924	As in Capcom's Gamers Day.
2948664	2951746	Well, they're letting people who are not the press go.
2952846	2954287	Except they're only letting five of them go.
2955127	2962190	So, basically, five lucky people are going to be able to get in and they're actually calling it Captivate 08.
2963351	2966452	Which is, I guess, kind of an interesting name.
2968073	2968293	But...
2969511	2972092	If you're lucky, you get to get in and play with everybody else.
2973793	2980715	But, um, basically, um, I don't really see, though, anything on here about how it actually is accomplished.
2981095	2982676	I think you have to write them, basically.
2982716	2986878	There's a little thingy, email them, saying why you think you should be able to go.
2987298	2989178	And then they pick a winner out of that.
2990239	2994641	Uh, there's actually a link on there afterwards that you basically said it, so there you go.
2996541	2996881	Beg!
2996901	2998362	That still sucks, though.
2998968	3000049	Get one and sell it on eBay.
3000329	3001490	Well, you should enter the contest.
3001750	3002930	Don't tell them you do this show.
3002990	3008393	Just tell them, you know, oh, I grew up on Mega Man and I love Capcom and Street Fighter is so memorable to me.
3009014	3010595	Write something really cheesy and maybe they'll pick you.
3011355	3012076	They get to go anyway.
3013416	3015257	That's not a cool lie to them like that.
3015277	3017419	It's not lying.
3017479	3023142	No, you've got to say that you're part of an independent podcast and that they don't give the little guy a fair shake and then you make them feel bad.
3025160	3031361	And then they don't care, then you say, well, fuck, your Mega Man games lately have sucked, so what do I care?
3031401	3036982	Let's say you enter it and then you lose because they say, oh, well, you know, you're a podcaster.
3037322	3043163	You know, then that's a double standard because then they're saying, oh, but podcasters and people like that aren't supposed to come to this.
3043403	3044583	So make up your mind.
3044603	3045824	It doesn't make any sense, though.
3045884	3049204	Podcasters and people in the media aren't supposed to come to their media event?
3049344	3050164	Oh, that sucks.
3050864	3051525	Oh, I'm sorry.
3051625	3053905	We're not, you know, IGN or anything, so that's fine.
3054810	3055210	Whatever.
3055330	3056931	I don't want to play Mega Man.
3057271	3061873	Was it Star Force, Zerker X, you know, Sauron or Ninja?
3062233	3064554	It'll all be on YouTube the day after anyway.
3064614	3065394	I really don't care.
3067695	3068796	I'm just bitter like that.
3068836	3069456	Well, I don't know.
3069496	3072317	I mean, the Gamer Day events we have gone to in the past have been kind of fun.
3072677	3073718	Yeah, all two of them.
3073778	3075299	It is kind of thrilling to be there, you know.
3075579	3079941	Yeah, Konami was the only ones that invited us and then they moved away.
3080801	3082061	So, oh, bye-bye.
3082562	3082942	Bye-bye.
3083142	3083362	Okay.
3084352	3086433	Anyways, there's a game out there.
3087073	3088313	This is free to play, too.
3088333	3090574	You don't have to go to some stupid gamer's day to play it.
3091474	3092995	It's a game called Tetroid 2012.
3094455	3098696	It's a mashup of Tetris and Arkanoid.
3099296	3104078	And actually, I think a little bit like Silent Hills, especially if you listen to some of the soundtrack for it.
3104238	3105458	It's really trippy.
3105818	3106939	But it's free to download.
3107059	3110400	It's actually available on... Let's see here.
3110880	3111720	Come over to the website.
3112828	3115629	It's a 111 meg download too, if I remember correctly.
3115849	3117449	Lots of music and sound effects in there.
3117909	3125091	But the website to go check it out, it's entity.be slash entity.
3125752	3128512	And then there's some links to the games that they make.
3128532	3133414	They made, of course, this game and then, I guess, a remake of Tempest.
3133934	3136415	So if you're a fan of Tempest, you can check that out as well.
3136555	3137275	I heart Tempest.
3137335	3138055	I might have to check that.
3138075	3139695	Does it go Super Zapper Recharge?
3140036	3141536	I don't know, but it's very trippy looking.
3142369	3147152	Before this, though, from what I remember, I guess that they used to do, like, demo scene stuff.
3147513	3151255	You know, all the, like, encoding graphic little demos and stuff like that.
3152016	3154237	But it is a very trippy-looking game.
3155258	3160982	I was looking at that Tetroid 2012 a little bit ago, and it definitely looks interesting.
3161002	3169588	Because you charge up with, like, a little special meter, and then when you hit the special button, it flips the whole screen upside down, and then you turn into, like, you know, Arkanoid mode or whatever.
3169868	3171129	I have to admit, that's kind of neat.
3172426	3176279	So hopefully we'll check that out a little later.
3176319	3177904	At least maybe I'll download that and check it out.
3178662	3179103	and DarkSakura.com.
3204245	3207426	You might be Link and you're in the Super Mario Bros.
3207506	3209887	world and you're trying to stab at asteroids.
3210307	3213368	And then all of a sudden you're Pac-Man and you're in Arkanoid.
3214268	3216389	It randomly changes your characters too.
3216509	3222631	So sometimes you will have the really crappy Space Invaders ship and stuff like that.
3224511	3230053	Some of them can only shoot in one direction and you have to basically play them like their respective games.
3230811	3231231	IndieGames.com
3258510	3260851	That's the best name ever, Funk Monkey.
3274465	3281226	That's why I made Polychromatic Funk Monkey a tile-based platforming game about building maps for tile-based platforming games.
3281846	3292228	In Polychromatic Funk Monkey, the eponymous monkey of funk brings order and rhythm to his chaotic land arranging the blocks he finds into towering staircases and bridges in the sky.
3294248	3295029	Sounds like a riot.
3295169	3296929	And then there's another game called Fishy Fishy.
3299649	3301430	I think this might be one of my new favorite developers.
3302870	3303150	That's
3304127	3304567	Beautiful.
3304607	3305628	You can get them on the show.
3307129	3307609	You should.
3308210	3310711	Okay, I will send an email this week and see what we can do.
3310731	3311212	Okay.
3312573	3320498	But he'll have to wait because I'm not doing anything special for Life365, so maybe we can have him on our debut all games episode.
3320518	3324981	I have to say, though, I watched someone play through a whole game of Romchek fail.
3325561	3327602	I was cracking up the entire time.
3327622	3328623	Romchek win.
3329584	3330064	I know.
3330284	3331025	Win for reals.
3332306	3332926	So guess what?
3333706	3334727	We have more news.
3335007	3335307	Okay.
3336107	3339949	Paramount is going to be getting into games.
3341049	3347412	They are going to be doing mobile, handheld, casual games because they make money.
3348473	3354155	And a lot of them are talking about tie-ins between their movie franchises and these games.
3355236	3357457	So hey, that'd be cool.
3358542	3360103	Here's the other thing I bet happened.
3360143	3370170	Paramount realized, writer's strike, loss of money, people aren't going to the movies like they used to, video games, money machine.
3371571	3372151	What would you do?
3372211	3379857	They also may have realized, hey, Sony, Warner, Vividi, they're all in games as well.
3379957	3380477	Vivendi?
3380817	3381298	Vivendi.
3381358	3382198	You said Vinvidi.
3383219	3383539	Whatever.
3384560	3386361	Fusion of Vivendi and Invidia.
3386921	3387482	Vinvidia.
3389042	3389823	Vivendi, whatever.
3390263	3392865	Oh, and Disney or Buena Vista.
3393666	3394486	They're all in games.
3394927	3397389	So, why not them?
3397969	3398530	Hooray!
3400772	3408878	One game that they're not making, but you can get for dirt cheap, at least this week in Steam, has been offering Prey for $4.95.
3409098	3411240	This week and only.
3411300	3413902	So, apparently if you listen to this on podcast, you've missed out.
3414323	3415243	Unless you bought this already.
3415644	3416004	But, uh,
3417128	3420611	Get it now, because you only have a few hours left before this deal is up.
3422213	3438267	And Pray, for those who may not remember, was a 3D Realms game, not Duke Nukem Forever, and involved you, a Native American, to be basically abducted onto a ship where there's a bunch of weird, crazy shit, and you can never die.
3440011	3443654	We can die in the very early levels if you're not good at first-person shooters.
3443734	3446516	I died once in the early levels because I'm horrible at first-person shooters.
3446877	3448218	I played it on the Xbox 360.
3448278	3450299	It's not bad, and it has a beautiful soundtrack.
3450319	3452061	It has an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack.
3452461	3456004	It's from the guy who did Oblivion and Guild Wars and all that, so you know the music's good.
3456965	3459347	The game itself, kind of a little short.
3459727	3464030	I remember it kind of just ended suddenly, but definitely made way for a sequel.
3465732	3465992	All right.
3466820	3467840	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3495549	3496349	So give us a call.
3496450	3497750	We're already getting a call.
3498431	3499591	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3499611	3499991	Who's this?
3504174	3505414	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3505434	3505795	Who's this?
3508656	3511137	Yeah, you're just a little quiet, but maybe that's our studio mic.
3511157	3512078	What's on your mind, Zaku?
3513359	3514019	Nothing much.
3514119	3523204	Just trying to... Just trying to go through, you know... It kind of sucks that you have to ditch Live 365, you know...
3523547	3525289	Well, it kind of sucks they had to double their rates.
3525329	3526610	Hold on, you are really quiet.
3526630	3527811	Can you get closer to your microphone?
3527871	3528552	It's not just us.
3528852	3530273	You're coming through really quiet on the thing.
3531234	3531835	Perfect, there you go.
3532895	3535178	Okay, much better.
3535538	3536118	Much better.
3536198	3537279	Alright, what's on your mind?
3537299	3538961	So it sucks we have to leave Life 365.
3540622	3550091	Let me see, I was going to get Rainbow Six Vegas, but what I read is that Ubisoft's not doing their job and trying to get the shit out of it.
3552272	3555975	all the bugs on the PS3 and 360 that are making me jittery.
3556796	3560739	It's just making me nervous right now before I even buy the damn thing.
3563021	3564582	You said it was Rainbow Six Vegas 2?
3565462	3566223	2, yeah.
3566523	3567904	Have you played Rainbow Six Vegas 2?
3568345	3569606	I don't like the Tom Clancy games.
3569866	3573629	I have some folks on my Xbox Live list though that have been playing nothing but that lately.
3574449	3580594	Yeah, they're lucky enough to do the crap that the current bugs that haven't been fixed yet
3584960	3587501	Did you actually buy the game or were you just worried about it?
3588102	3588342	Not yet.
3588362	3590203	I just read it on Kotaku, that's the thing.
3591223	3601169	I just read it from other folks that the PS3 version of the servers were basically just getting really flaky and just not connecting through games.
3601890	3606132	The 360 version was about the same with very noticeable glitches and whatnot.
3606853	3610115	So I'm waiting right now, so I'm getting paid tomorrow.
3610911	3618874	Hopefully, if there's a patch coming out very soon, that's all I need for me to actually go down to GameStop and buy the game.
3620694	3630158	Well, is there anybody in chat at our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, that maybe has some suggestions on this game?
3630198	3633899	Like, is it worth buying it now, or should you wait for a patch, or what?
3634179	3639661	Because, yeah, Loki doesn't play those games, I don't think Jamie's played it, and I have not played it, so I'm kind of curious if anyone in our chat...
3640348	3641649	has anything to say about it.
3642649	3643009	We'll see.
3644290	3646570	It's part of the beauty of doing this live with the chat room.
3646610	3648971	When we are not familiar with it, hopefully somebody else is.
3649392	3651532	What else is on your mind, Zaku, while we wait for some comments?
3653253	3665218	I know I don't like to bring up Bomani that much, but EMUs, by now you've probably heard it's already rolling out on somewhat of a national level, although it's in one arcade.
3665558	3667558	Yeah, we covered the one arcade a couple weeks ago.
3667578	3668819	Has it rolled out to more yet?
3670457	3685414	I mean, no unlocks so far, so I'm not sure whether, you know, at this rate if we're trying to catch up to Japan in terms of unlocking the games, by the time they're done, we'll be done in like, what, October, November, at that rate?
3686218	3690001	Well, they've only got one arcade working on it.
3690041	3691762	Hey, we got a response about Vegas 2.
3692442	3701989	Ross2UT says, Well, I got my version of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 exchanged for the 360, and it's fine, aside from the odd frame rate drop, which never becomes unplayable.
3702829	3706932	Online co-op is absolutely amazing, especially as you actually go through the story this time.
3707632	3708073	There you have it.
3709794	3710114	Oh, well.
3710374	3711775	Sounds like a fairly favorable review.
3712936	3713256	Yeah.
3714117	3714417	All right.
3715037	3717119	Zaku, anything else before we let you go and take some more calls?
3718441	3725829	Any plans on finding a good replacement for Live 365 that won't involve paying royalties up the ass?
3725929	3734638	Yes, listen to Part A. We are going to be merging with AllGames.com and doing our show live on their feed, and you won't have to register or any of that stuff anymore.
3734678	3735219	It's going to be great.
3736528	3741411	So, in terms of the radio station, that's done for good, right?
3741791	3746674	As far as the 24-hour day, 7-day-a-week feed, yes.
3747515	3749576	We're not going to be operating it on Life 35 anymore.
3750176	3755439	Instead, we're going to be trying to come together with other independent podcasters to create a Voltron network.
3756460	3757160	Oh, really now?
3757580	3757981	Oh, really.
3758061	3760082	Will you still be able to play the music eventually?
3761635	3762836	Nothing is changing on our show.
3762956	3764097	Everything is staying the same.
3764457	3764798	Of course.
3766319	3770943	I just wanted to be kept in the loop just like everyone else.
3772325	3776288	I just got in right now, just playing my 360 up until like an hour ago.
3776749	3777529	All right.
3777550	3779812	Well, check out part A when it goes up later tonight.
3779852	3780572	How's all the details?
3780612	3780893	All righty?
3781753	3782054	All right.
3782174	3782354	All right.
3782394	3782834	Take care, buddy.
3783515	3783975	Have a good one.
3784296	3784576	All right.
3785011	3790074	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3790134	3790994	Let's take another call.
3792075	3793196	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3793216	3793596	Who's this?
3795137	3795857	GS68.
3796057	3797058	Hello, GS68.
3797078	3797878	What is on your mind?
3798579	3804963	I've been reading the comments for this one story and thinking about how PC gaming is dying.
3805123	3813648	There's a lot of comments saying about how PC gaming is not dead and how PC gaming is inferior to consoles and crap.
3813688	3813968	I mean...
3815185	3819771	They got me wondering, I mean, aside from the games, what do consoles have on PCs?
3819871	3831907	I mean, and then, like, there's some people talking about how, like, keyboard and mouse, like, goes great with, like, how, like, there should be keyboard and mouse support for every PS3 game, among other things.
3834734	3835134	I don't know.
3835575	3839336	I don't think there's a lot of truth to that whole PC gaming is dying.
3839416	3844438	I think it's that when a game comes out on the PC and the console, the console tends to do a little better.
3844758	3845238	But come on.
3845258	3846578	That's what I'm focusing on.
3846818	3848599	But look at a game like World of Warcraft.
3848699	3849459	That's huge.
3849920	3850740	You know what?
3850880	3851980	That's only on the PC.
3852020	3855541	You're not going to hear... I'm not exactly talking about PC games dying.
3855682	3862324	I'm just talking about a lot of people saying how PC gaming is superior to console gaming and...
3864045	3877597	How PC can do everything for your homework or browsing the internet and you don't have to buy $500 consoles every few years, just upgraded PCs.
3878298	3883262	With that said, what do consoles have on PCs besides the games on them?
3885149	3885670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3899076	3901538	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3926132	3931397	Those that remember when the Commodore 64 was out in this country and it did very well in Europe as well.
3931777	3939905	That's one reason the Commodore 64 did so great is because not only did the Commodore 64 have a monitor it would hook up to, but it also would hook up to your TV.
3940686	3944069	And that was a pretty big deal to have a home computer that actually was on your TV as well.
3944830	3948413	So I think there really is just that convenience of having it in your living room.
3949952	3963976	I mean, even games that normally go on consoles, like 2D platformers and scrolling shooters, I mean, there are... I mean, there are, like, free games that they can download on their PC.
3964016	3968057	I mean, like, look at Cave Story and, just for Dark Tetsuya, La Milana.
3968777	3972639	I mean, those are great platforms, but they're not on consoles.
3972699	3976120	I mean, they're for the PC, and they're free.
3976140	3976480	I mean...
3979317	3984300	I mean, I can't name any free console games or free indie console games.
3984360	3986981	I'll give you one, and I hate to say it, but Yaris.
3988762	3992704	Well, there was also Aegis Wing and a few of those.
3992744	3996606	A very, very few handful available on Xbox Live.
3996667	3997827	I would like to see more.
3998608	4005031	I would like to see a subscription-based available service or some more free perks on the consoles here and there, but
4005595	4006135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4030755	4039200	It's very easy in comparison to just fire up a coding program and a C++ compiler or whatever language you want to program in and make your game.
4039220	4040041	You know what I mean?
4043783	4051308	I think that's kind of the difference is that it's more accessible to make stuff indie-wise on the PC than it is for consoles who have a very closed authoring format.
4054690	4057832	Alright, well GS68, do you have anything else you want to share or ask us tonight?
4058582	4059022	DarkSakura
4084215	4084936	I love the ferret.
4085436	4085996	I know you do.
4086397	4087358	Well, it's on camera.
4088178	4088999	Too bad it's not on the camera.
4089019	4090760	That's my ferret headgear.
4090780	4093062	Can I wear the ferret on my head for a little bit on the cam?
4093642	4095164	I don't even know if Justin TV is working right now.
4095424	4098066	I've been very terrible at checking that chat tonight.
4098947	4099927	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4099947	4100268	Who's this?
4101208	4103630	Hey, it's DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Sessions.
4103850	4106653	Well, hello, DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Sessions.
4106693	4107013	What's up?
4108072	4113894	Not much, and that was me that told you that we were doing a live feed of OLR from Anime Boston.
4113934	4114534	Did it happen?
4114574	4115435	Did it actually happen?
4116415	4117035	Partially.
4117095	4121797	When we got there, we started setting up, I started the feed, and I'm like, okay, where's the power?
4123004	4123965	Where's the power?
4124345	4126987	I see other dealers, other vendors with power.
4127047	4127868	I'm like, okay.
4127888	4134132	I go over to the convention head, center head to get power.
4134152	4136514	It's like 119 for the full weekend.
4136534	4139917	So we're like – This is a long no answer, isn't it?
4140697	4141478	So it was like, no.
4142178	4147602	So we ended up having the feed a little bit on Friday and for about a couple of hours on Sunday.
4148423	4150284	Were you here for the announcement?
4150365	4152166	Because that was a heck of a show to be listening to.
4153831	4160556	I was having a WrestleMania 24 party, but I did hear the announcement about where OLR is heading off to.
4160576	4164439	The thing is, I actually know somebody that probably would have kept you guys going for 24-7.
4177624	4178225	It's okay.
4178645	4184406	We got a lot of great offers along those types of lines, but we're excited about the powers of Voltron.
4185267	4187127	So we'll see what happens.
4187707	4188848	I think it's going to be exciting.
4189128	4190168	Well, what else is on your mind, Ranma?
4191328	4191749	Not too much.
4191789	4200471	I wanted to basically give you guys a basic con rap of anime Boston, and believe it or not, you want to know what most popular items in the dealer's room was?
4201871	4203592	Final Fantasy VII related material.
4204514	4204734	Nope.
4204974	4209097	Goji is always the number two item sold at dealers rooms.
4210357	4210838	Dolphins.
4212178	4212499	Nope.
4212759	4213739	I bet there were some though.
4214600	4215340	I did see a couple.
4216901	4217401	Alright, what?
4217461	4217902	I give up.
4218862	4220243	Nintendo merchandise.
4220503	4228127	Almost every single vendor had all kinds of Super Mario Brothers or standard Nintendo merchandise that was selling like hotcakes.
4228167	4229328	Oh yeah, was WYSIWYG there?
4230316	4230856	Yes, they were.
4231316	4236218	They are the big culprits for the Nintendo goods, plus they sell Pocky.
4237979	4240440	Well, they weren't selling Pocky at this con, though.
4240520	4240920	Sad!
4241961	4247963	They can't, because when your convention is in a convention center, according to the contract, you're not allowed to sell food.
4248444	4251905	Well, that sucks, because I bought every burger at Faname last year.
4253263	4254604	is that that candy hamburger stuff?
4254644	4274394	yes the candy hamburger I love that stuff that stuff is really good well that stuff is fine but you got people you can't sell like Pocky or Ramenade and stuff like that that you can't sell lame yeah yeah I know I know it's kind of crazy though but me and my crew we're trying to figure out like a way around that well good luck to you how was the con?
4274414	4275455	otherwise good times?
4276460	4277401	It was great.
4277581	4283005	The number one problem was the long, long, long, long.
4283085	4285567	Did I mention long lines for registration?
4286488	4287269	Oh, of course.
4287369	4290511	That seems to be the problem with a lot of anime cons is long registration lines.
4291172	4295375	Yeah, but at most cons, it's like you wait no more than an hour to get your badge.
4295795	4299718	There were people that were waiting anywhere between 5 and 11 hours for their badges.
4300519	4302040	11 hours to get a badge?
4302060	4303021	Yes, I'm not kidding.
4303041	4304502	You've got to be fucking kidding me.
4304762	4305323	That's crazy.
4305363	4305483	Nope.
4307042	4307782	That's crazy talk.
4308583	4311343	Yeah, they printed them out on these machines and the machines broke.
4311363	4315185	There's only four people on registration and the lines were going forever.
4316045	4316965	Lesson learned.
4317966	4319006	Someone posted a link.
4319046	4322487	They did a parody of Still Alive to Still in Line.
4323267	4323548	Nice.
4324388	4333631	I think, and I've been suggesting this for a while now, for conventions they should take the old E3 approach and mail your pass.
4334818	4336499	or just don't make fancy fucking badges
4357796	4358256	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4377817	4380179	Bulk rate, I guess, would be available for business.
4380759	4387964	But have them print it out and, you know, you pay like X amount extra to have, you know, your badge mailed to you.
4389384	4390545	I know that's a good thing.
4390585	4395108	You know, I actually know a couple of people that are like reg, throwing heads at worked reg.
4395809	4397790	And they say it just doesn't work that way.
4397810	4398790	It wouldn't work out.
4398810	4400251	It wouldn't be all that cost effective.
4400952	4403313	Well, that's the paying a little extra.
4404134	4404354	Yeah.
4405410	4414814	I mean, that was the only method that someone wants to avoid the long line, then just say, well, I will pay another $5 for postage and you can mail it to me.
4415835	4422838	Well, what some cons are doing now, they're offering like two-year badges, three-year badges, lifetime badges, and pre-con night.
4423138	4433583	The thing is, not everybody's going to come up Thursday night for a convention, so to give that option, and a lot of people still do it, but the difference is you show up Thursday, you get your badge under 15 minutes tops.
4434204	4441732	AX did the day before thing, and it was just as much of a, pardon the expression, clusterfuck as it is doing day of.
4443293	4443734	Interesting.
4443754	4447838	Basically, if you're not there by 10 a.m., you're basically SOL.
4448018	4450020	Well, we've got to wrap up, Ranma.
4450100	4456066	Definitely some lessons learned for anybody thinking about throwing on a convention in the near future, but any last-minute thoughts for our folks?
4457068	4460571	Three links I posted in the chat room, pictures from my website.
4460851	4466174	One picture is a cart, a facial looking like World 1-1 from Super Mario Brothers.
4466494	4469536	And the last two pictures is the old man from The Legend of Zelda.
4471337	4475720	The first one says, it's dangerous to go alone, take this.
4476360	4480363	And the second one says, Dodongo dislikes smoke.
4484116	4485457	I figured you'd get a kick out of that.
4485697	4486857	Sorry, I'm looking at the picture.
4486897	4487598	That's great.
4488798	4490259	I know this is horrible radio.
4490319	4494802	But there actually is somebody dressed up holding a big old poster board that says it's dangerous to go alone.
4494862	4495362	Take this.
4495682	4496562	But where's the sword?
4496923	4497263	Hello?
4497963	4500705	Or the cannon.
4500745	4505727	If you go to DJRanmas.net and click on Gallery, you'll see all the pictures from Anime Boston 08.
4506007	4507688	It's like 320 shots I took.
4508168	4508509	All right.
4508689	4509269	Sounds like fun.
4509789	4510810	All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.
4510890	4511390	Take more calls.
4511430	4511690	All right.
4512190	4512771	Take care, guys.
4512791	4513211	All right.
4514231	4516532	One more call and we're going to call it a night.
4516552	4517272	877-GAME-OLR.
4517292	4519413	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4521053	4523834	And while we wait for a call, Loki, any quick last minute stories?
4523934	4526375	Yeah, I've been gathering stories this entire time.
4526975	4527596	Oh, we got one more.
4529796	4530677	I love cutting you off.
4531117	4532137	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4532177	4532577	Who's this?
4533678	4534498	The ferret's going to go.
4537813	4539034	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4567665	4568125	Nothing much.
4568626	4571248	I've been hanging out in your chat room trying to calm everybody's fears.
4571488	4576573	Yeah, about like, OMG, we're going to have to suddenly change everything we're doing.
4576613	4580436	And I'm kind of like, have you ever listened to the other shows on allgames.com?
4580616	4581997	Yeah, don't worry about it.
4583338	4587942	What would we have to change other than maybe I'll have to bring on a soundboard?
4588082	4589464	No, I'm just kidding.
4590044	4591325	And you'll have to get rid of the ferret.
4591525	4593247	And the ferret.
4594246	4604692	And we're going to put a big picture on our, big thing on our site, you know, saying, hey, you know, Orange Signs Radio is coming in, we're going to get, like, Tingle, and we're going to Photoshop Loki's head on it, and that's going to be your new logo.
4604872	4606293	It's going to be awesome.
4606313	4606713	Nice.
4607394	4607974	Can't wait.
4608414	4611456	See, these are all the type of editorial decisions that are being made for us now.
4611476	4612737	That's as close as you'll ever get.
4615298	4616639	I'll go buy Eye of Judgment again.
4617380	4618420	Go ahead, Neil.
4619681	4620601	How many copies are we up to?
4620642	4622703	We haven't had an update in a long time.
4622723	4622923	That's...
4624272	4625333	Yes, I want you to look it up.
4625493	4626934	The listeners demand to know this.
4627294	4628735	What's new in your gaming world, Bobby?
4628755	4630656	What types of stuff have you been playing lately and enjoying?
4631757	4636880	Believe it or not, recently I've picked up, I got an old retro Japanese RPG kick.
4637441	4639622	I recently started playing the original Suikoden again.
4640383	4640543	Oh.
4641203	4646506	And it was mainly because somebody wrote me on my PS3 saying, why don't you ever play games on your PS3?
4646526	4647527	So I'm playing Suikoden.
4648488	4649989	So you're playing a PS1 game on your PS3, nice.
4650816	4651517	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4667102	4668442	Leading the All Games Radio team.
4668583	4670303	I stopped running that app a long time ago.
4670323	4676325	But if I get a PlayStation 3, Bobby, we will work together, this Voltron of podcasts, to cure cancer.
4676345	4677606	Because only Voltron can cure cancer.
4677646	4678866	Here's where we're at right now.
4678886	4681407	We're still at .18 million.
4681827	4685368	But the problem is it's not tracking the UK sales.
4685928	4689730	But I can guarantee that they're not any more than the US sales.
4689770	4694371	So even if the number were doubled, you would still not be to where you need to be.
4695952	4696792	Very sad to hear that.
4698549	4699690	Never going to happen.
4699810	4700970	I'm not sad to hear that.
4701010	4710532	In fact, they only sold, was it week 10, which I guess was last week, they sold 8,627 units in the U.S.
4711433	4713553	Now how about copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever?
4714333	4715714	I don't even think that's on here.
4715754	4717674	I don't think they're even tracking that one.
4719735	4720595	I'll get back to you on that.
4721015	4722095	All right, please do.
4722295	4724416	They're not tracking it because it's just too many.
4725933	4727774	Yes, that's right.
4727914	4728874	It blew sales through the roof.
4729274	4741276	Bobby, any other things that our listeners ought to know about this whole all games transition or anything they should know about allgames.com and why it's the place for OLR?
4742757	4751058	Well, for one, no more ads if you try to listen to the live stream and no more funky players that you have to click through things to get to it.
4751098	4753639	You go to allgames.com or you go to allgamesradio.com
4754562	4754982	and DarkSakura.
4777812	4778713	It's going to be very easy.
4778753	4781135	It's a higher quality, no more MP3 Pro.
4782296	4787460	But we don't plan to have you guys change anything music-wise or anything.
4787700	4790983	And I know a lot of people are like, well, what about the music and stuff?
4791624	4801352	And Rob, you know that I'm willing to talk to you about that and maybe even doing a music block from your library or even just merging your library of music into ours during the 24-7 stream.
4802705	4804626	and bring in some of your other talk programs over.
4804727	4808269	You know, I'm not keeping this only to the Sunday night thing.
4808609	4809030	Very cool.
4809050	4818396	And that's part of, you know, why it was a good idea is that, you know, it's not just, you know, that All Games is sucking this show up and tearing it away from what we had.
4818456	4820358	I mean, it is kind of like a, you know...
4821227	4834579	I think one way when we were kind of talking about it was that it's now the resources of the three of us that make this show happen and some of the other people behind OLR are now troops in the allgames.com universe and can work towards building good ideas there.
4834659	4840564	And I think it's going to be great because I know everybody over there has got ideas and Lord knows we have ideas of our own.
4840664	4842025	It's just going to keep going from there.
4842345	4842986	It's going to be great.
4843703	4844444	It's a new chapter.
4845044	4848627	We'll send the camera crew up there for Loki and the Tingle outfit and everything.
4848867	4849447	Oh, awesome.
4849688	4849988	Awesome.
4850008	4850448	Can't wait.
4850949	4853811	That'd be awesome whenever that sells a million copies.
4854872	4855632	It'll be at PAX.
4858374	4861357	But I will say this, you know, because I know you're thinking about coming up to PAX.
4861397	4863779	We're actually trying to do something really big at PAX.
4864039	4864299	Oh, nice.
4864339	4865540	In terms of live streaming.
4866521	4867161	I'm going up there.
4867201	4868782	Kropotkin and Hendrix are actually coming out there.
4868802	4870284	Kropotkin's coming out from the UK.
4870384	4871304	Wow, that is big.
4871324	4871865	Flying to PAX.
4872683	4876105	and we've got a couple of our, I think, you know, Chatterbox is always up there.
4876805	4880887	Evil Avatar, it's their 10th anniversary for evilavatar.com, so they're doing a big thing as well.
4881487	4886189	And, you know, Evil Avatar Radio is one of our affiliates and stuff, so we're planning on doing some big stuff at PAX.
4886529	4886769	Nice.
4886789	4892311	So I'd love to see you guys represented with or without the Tingle outfit, but I think the Tingle outfit would be awesome.
4893072	4894432	It's mid-August, right?
4895393	4896233	Last weekend in August.
4896313	4897353	It's actually Labor Day weekend.
4897734	4898114	Oh, nice.
4898154	4901035	Which means, well, it's the same weekend as DragonCon.
4901610	4904972	Oh, for you especially.
4905093	4905773	That's a bummer.
4906874	4907935	Yeah, I chose PAX.
4908155	4910316	Yeah, PAX is more gaming anyway.
4910356	4913038	DragonCon's a little more D20s and stuff, right?
4914579	4918682	DragonCon's more, you know, let's all fawn over Joss Whedon and everything he's touched.
4918842	4919243	Joss!
4920544	4922325	I don't know, DarkSakura might choose to go there.
4923942	4927204	I wouldn't phrase it that way.
4927364	4928245	Josh is the man.
4928545	4930346	Definitely, I haven't been to PAX.
4930426	4931166	I want to go.
4931727	4937830	Definitely, I like what I'm hearing, and we'll have to see what we can do to make that happen, especially if it's a long weekend and it's that far off.
4937990	4939951	I don't see why at least I can't get up there.
4940391	4943293	Hopefully, if the monies work out, we can get everybody up there somehow.
4943713	4944554	We might be able to make it work.
4944754	4947155	We have to get the wife to agree to let Loki go.
4947215	4951638	I might actually be able to go because we do our game conferencing at my work,
4952119	4952199	E3 E3
4976823	4977143	and so on.
5001252	5001572	and stuff.
5001612	5003473	And that's a lot of stuff that E3 didn't have.
5003513	5008435	It's way more community oriented and it's basically what people thought E3 was.
5008895	5010816	People who've never been to E3, it's what they thought it was.
5010836	5012316	Sounds like it's going to be a ton of fun.
5012356	5013597	We'll definitely have to make that happen.
5013617	5026362	The only reason I didn't go last year, the only thing that stopped me from going last year is that my BFF from college got married that exact same weekend and she said if I did not go to her wedding I would be killed.
5026422	5028803	But this year no one's getting married that I know of.
5030184	5030604	No weddings.
5030624	5031024	They do kill them.
5031363	5031883	No weddings.
5032643	5034864	Or don't plan it during PAX because I want to go.
5036584	5039804	We'll be doing live streaming from there, and so we'd love to have you guys as part of it.
5040124	5040445	Excellent.
5040485	5041425	We'll see what we can do, Bobby.
5041785	5045665	Well, Bobby, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap this show up before it's getting really late for you guys out there.
5045765	5046746	So we're going to wrap it up.
5047686	5048306	Kill the ferret.
5048526	5048766	All right.
5048786	5049146	We'll try.
5049746	5049986	All right.
5050786	5051586	Have a good one, Bobby.
5052427	5055867	And we look forward to being partnered up with you on Sunday nights.
5055887	5056747	I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
5057447	5058788	It'll be a lot of fun on April 13th.
5059068	5059368	All right.
5059408	5060128	That's D-Day.
5060568	5061208	Have a good one, Bobby.
5062009	5064730	I always enjoy hearing from Bobby.
5066271	5067912	Alright, we're going to close up the Skype line now.
5067932	5070373	We're running a little long here in Part B, which is okay.
5070713	5074195	We can go as long as we want, and we'll get to continue to go as long as we want on all games.
5074335	5075695	They're not scheduling anything after us.
5075755	5076256	It's beautiful.
5077096	5081518	Alright, but Loki did want to get to some last-minute stories, so I suppose we should get those out.
5081778	5084900	Oh, I have a ton of them now, thanks to you cutting me off all the time.
5085280	5085440	Dick.
5086611	5087192	Let's see here.
5087232	5091834	We'll just go down the list then of all the wonderful stuff, whether it be important or not.
5093055	5100038	SOCOM Confrontation comes out on the PSN, or the PlayStation Network, September 16th.
5100459	5104741	And it'll be a great addition to, I guess, the SOCOM series.
5104761	5105441	It looks pretty.
5106221	5109263	And, yeah, look forward to that in the fall.
5109723	5111844	Another game coming in the fall, Far Cry 2.
5111924	5113945	That's coming to consoles or at least Xbox 360 and PS3.
5115308	5143290	as well as PC no word on exactly when but fall-ish area Madden turns 20 this year and Madden 09 will be coming out August 12th as well as a collector's edition which will feature exclusively NFL Head Coach 09 which I'm glad because that game sucks or at least looks like crap I know the first one didn't sell very well for me and I don't want to push this one so awesome and let's see here
5144509	5149191	There is a rumor about what Sega will be showing off at their Gamers Day.
5149811	5156273	Some of the stuff rumored in there, a brand new Knights game and also a new Eternal Arcadia game.
5157994	5162816	Some other stuff, of course, a preview for Sonic Unleashed, which I think we've all seen that anyways.
5164096	5164396	Oops.
5165076	5165657	Whoopsie.
5166057	5167857	And a game called The Crucible, Evil Within.
5167898	5169158	I hope that's not based off the book.
5170070	5175534	and... You know where I want to go with this and I'm just biting my tongue.
5176735	5181939	But that is too funny that they are actually thinking about putting a game about witch trials out.
5182379	5182719	Witch!
5185301	5186882	I don't know if it's based on that.
5187082	5188904	You can't write that, folks.
5189084	5189804	You can't write it.
5190625	5192486	And Super Monkey Ball for the iPhone.
5193387	5193767	Tentative.
5194948	5196469	Also, Samba de Amigo.
5197209	5199471	Wait, Samba de Amigo on the iPhone?
5199830	5199990	No.
5200350	5200450	Oh.
5201030	5201230	We.
5201730	5201830	Oh.
5202210	5202310	Oh.
5202731	5202931	Okay.
5203111	5203231	Yeah.
5203651	5206291	That's coming out this summer, by the way.
5207071	5216233	Remember we talked a little bit a while back about that homebrew game being made, Super Mario Fusion, that's going to have levels featuring Mega Man and Halo and stuff like that?
5216613	5224234	Well, they have a new video up now that shows one of the new suits you can get from Mario, which is a Mega Man suit with all the sound effects and stuff from Mega Man.
5224254	5227955	There's also apparently a Halo Spartan suit that you can get from Mario as well.
5228410	5230551	So looking for that game when that comes out eventually.
5231352	5238196	There's a rumor that some DS-like colors are coming to the UK soon, including green, ice, blue, and red.
5239117	5243800	And I'm not surprised because Nintendo likes to put out a ton of different colors of these things.
5244880	5250204	A French retailer is listing Grand Theft Auto 4 for the DS, although that might be a misprint, but who knows.
5251104	5252986	Let's see here...
5255509	5260251	EchoChrome's coming to the US like we said, I think sometime in April for $10.
5261092	5261832	So that's not bad.
5262713	5270057	Right now you can actually download on the PlayStation Store R-Type Command if you want to play a demo of that for the PSP.
5270357	5273518	That's that one that's like a RTS R-Type game.
5275139	5275640	Uh-huh.
5275980	5276540	It's kind of weird.
5276720	5277060	Interesting.
5277400	5282323	Another game coming out in April, Happy Tree Friends False Alarms coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
5283364	5283864	That'll be...
5284537	5284937	XBOX Live Arcade
5314130	5343822	3-4 player multiplayer tag battles and single player standard driller single player quest driller 100 puzzles so that's kind of neat let's see here and that's it alright that was a lot of last minute stories there's a lot of late breaking stuff tonight or just stuff we were too lazy to get to otherwise and I'm going to post this in chat room it's a wallpaper featuring portal you know their portal warning signs it's funny
5344500	5346001	Alright, we'll check that out.
5347982	5352725	That's going to bring us to the end of our show, except we've got one more thing to do, and that's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5353045	5354166	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5355307	5355767	Ferret.
5359009	5362131	My final thought is, why did I go out and get the ferret?
5362171	5364292	I could have just told her that I lost it forever.
5365653	5367114	I'm nice, that's my final thought.
5367154	5367474	I'm super nice.
5367494	5368315	I could have kicked you.
5369195	5370136	Loki, your final thought.
5371102	5374445	My final thought is I want to get to playing some more games this week.
5374525	5377587	I have a lot on my plate and a lot that I haven't gotten to yet.
5378208	5382551	And hopefully we'll get some curling action going on after the show.
5383514	5384555	on JustinTV.
5406398	5408020	It's something you kind of have to learn.
5408100	5413205	So I'd be pretty pissed off if I didn't have a high-def TV and I was trying to do video out on that stuff.
5413245	5421192	Apparently it works for UMD movies, but why they can't implement that for the composite cables is beyond me.
5421352	5421673	I don't know.
5421693	5422073	All right.
5422671	5425471	Alright, well that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
