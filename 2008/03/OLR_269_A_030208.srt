Mario Kart Wii also gets a date and online texting

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How are you Miss DarkSakura?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm well

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're well, that's good

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, I'm well

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're well, alright

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll explain why momentarily

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But first I have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How are you doing, Loki?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Good

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Alright

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sorry I don't have anything extra for you tonight, but you know, that's what happens

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I gotta say though, very interesting troubleshooting before the show

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We were kind of joking last week on the show that February is the month of Broken here on Orange Lounge Radio

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And unfortunately it looked like March was going to turn out the same way

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because for whatever reason we have a wireless network that sits inside the house here where we tape

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And for whatever reason just last week when we were doing the short show

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It suddenly decided that the strength is not going to be as powerful anymore

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And the Justin TV cam would not see, that runs off an iBook that would no longer see the WiFi network

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And then tonight Jamie's computer decided it wasn't going to see the network either

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I have no idea what's going on with the box

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But very impressed with the technical skills behind

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What did we do? We turned your computer

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We turned my computer into a gateway

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So it's using my wireless internet connection

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But I have an ethernet cable and you ran it to the old router

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So it's bouncing wireless to the router to my laptop, wireless to the other router

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So right now

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We'll do a piggybacking

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam which is back this week

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hi guys

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is going through this router

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That goes through Loki's computer

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That goes through the router in the house which goes to Comcast

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And the internet

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Amazing

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is uber geek tech talk here on Orange Lounge Radio

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's like a wireless orgy

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Alright

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have something for Jamie

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And it's actually her birthday present

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And it's like six weeks early

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Because it's something you have to prepare for

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I'm going to give this to you

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Plus I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So I think this is a good time for me to give this to you

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So here you go

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Open it up and see what they're tickets to

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Alright and hopefully she likes it, I hope

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wow I know they heard this squeak on Justin TV

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yay

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Tell the listeners what I got you

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Rob got me a ticket to see Margaret Cho

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now in here locally

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now I'd also like to point out, look at where the seats are

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Eee

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's like close

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's third row

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Probably look up her nose

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Third row tickets

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So quite excited

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yay

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh my god where is this?

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Davis

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Really?

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So it's not that far at all

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Cool

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There we have it

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So mark that date on your calendar

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's May something something

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm doing that right now

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alright

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There you go

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I thought that would help after a poopy week

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So like I knew I had to tell you

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Or get tickets independently somehow

102
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I didn't even know

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I didn't either, I got an email about it

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So there you go

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I know Jamie loves some Margaret Cho and I do too

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She's pretty funny

107
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hopefully she's not quite so political

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But you know

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She's still somebody I like

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes me and you

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Cool

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alright

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There should be two there

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I was like

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I thought so because I was like

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No you have to take me I'm sorry

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Of course

123
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No this is so cool

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you Rob

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Alright you're welcome

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Now we can get to talking about video games yes?

127
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Alright

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So we're done with Tech Talk

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We're done with Oprah

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now let's talk

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's talk video games

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How was your gaming week

134
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Dark Sakura?

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
My gaming week was

136
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well it was interesting

137
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I picked it up

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then I had other stuff to do

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because I watched Tron earlier in the week

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was like

142
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I love Tron I want to play Kingdom Hearts

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because of the whole Space Paranoids level

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And there was a lot of burnout

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And I watched Dan play a lot of burnout

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I played a lot of Ragnarok

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That was it

148
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Alright

149
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well Loki how was your gaming week?

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
My gaming week was okay

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I played

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I actually picked up Pop Tippon

153
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I've been playing quite a bit of that

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In fact that's what I was playing before the show

155
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's fun

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's different

157
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I like it

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's very easy to play

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But I guess

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It takes some time to build up your armies and stuff

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then I played

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I actually purchased N Plus

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
On Xbox Live Arcade

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And that game is just as fun as the original N

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So thoroughly enjoying that

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Because we were having this party

170
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We have at the end of every month for our work

171
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And this one happened to be leap year themed

172
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And so they wanted Frogger

173
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And they used my system to play Frogger

174
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So I got to play some of that

175
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Because no one else was touching it

176
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And then

177
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So that's actually pretty cool

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I finally got to the point in the game

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Where one of the characters dies

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Not necessarily a main character

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But I was just very surprised

183
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
On how everyone makes that argument

184
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Of video games being art and stuff

185
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Shit I think there's a perfect example right there

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Of how powerful they can make the story

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And it was pretty cool

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm about 11 hours into it now

191
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Still on the first disc though

192
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And just taking my time through that

193
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And

194
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Pretty much that's it I guess

195
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Other than the usual Saints Row

196
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But

197
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No one wants to hear about that

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
For the five billionth time?

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well let's see

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
In my gaming week I also played Lost Odyssey

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And I had much the same experience as you did

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I got to the second disc

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Which means you kind of go through

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Some big plot twists in the first event

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or first disc let's put it that way

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And I'm amazed by the game

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flak

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
As it has been

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Although you know I do understand

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Some of the little complaints about the game

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And even one of them I find to be kind of annoying

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And that is lack of save points

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
One of the things that has been bugging me

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is that sometimes I'll be forced to sit there for an hour

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
While the next part of the game loads

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Or whatever

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I mean it just takes forever

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's crazy

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
To get to the next save point

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
While you watch through all these cut scenes

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I mean it's not like it's bad

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not like you're bored or anything

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Or you're just getting antsy

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because there's lots to do

226
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But sometimes I only want to play in little 30 minute chunks

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It auto saves too for some things

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Some things

230
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But not a lot

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I haven't had that problem with

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Save points

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What do you think about the difficulty of the game?

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's not that difficult

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Some of the first

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Some of the boss battles

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Were surprisingly tough

238
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you grind some of the way through there

239
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Because a lot of this game

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Seems like it's very quick

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There's certain areas in the game

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Where there's like 2 or 3 sections of the map

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And then that's it

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And then you're on to the next section of the world

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Or whatever

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's very small

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But I don't know

248
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It wasn't that difficult

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You just grind a little bit

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And get your characters leveled up

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And it's pretty easy

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Also I have the preorder bonus

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So I have an item that gives me

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A level 2 guard or whatever

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So I can block most of the shots

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Nice, I don't have that

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That was something you got for preorder, huh?

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hopefully they release that as a download thing later

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It will probably come later on

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's go over to the chat room

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The chat room has their own comments

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
rostelut says

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It only sucks when you die an hour without a save

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Kind of true, but there's also some things

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Where you go through cutscene, cutscene, cutscene

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And then you have to fight a big boss battle

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I know you can skip cutscenes

268
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But even then

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Sometimes you have to sit there

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And hit the game engine

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So you have to kind of sit there and press A-A-A-A-A

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can also pause it

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And hit the back button

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
For the cutscenes, but what about the ones

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where they're actually talking to each other

276
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
With the dialogue boxes, you have to A-A-A

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't know

278
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It doesn't matter

279
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's honestly just a tiny little blemish

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In what is otherwise a magnificent game

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That deserves to be getting more attention than it is

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
As far as other games I've been playing this week

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I've been playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Because

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I was

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Loki was kind enough to loan me his Japanese copy

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And the Wii to play it on

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So I was checking that out a little bit this week

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Didn't understand what I was doing, but I was having fun

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Playing just the massive

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Free-for-all mode

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So that was pretty cool

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Obviously, last week I was sick

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
On the show, and I'm happy to report I'm better

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I did have a sinus infection, so I had to go to a doctor

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And antibiotics and blah blah blah

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But Loki lent me that as kind of a get better soon type thing

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Which was very nice

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I didn't actually hook that thing up till like Friday

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's exactly why I loaded tickets

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is exactly what I'm doing

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not playing Smash Bros.

304
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, even before Smash Bros. Brawl

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I never played Melee very much

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Maybe once at a friend's house

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The first Smash Bros. Brawl I didn't even touch

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So

309
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't know

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not really my type of game

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's fun

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You know

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I may pick up the US one

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Gerardimo in chat says

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Rob, do you think Brawl lives up to the hype

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Even if it's not in English

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Kind of, it's hard to tell

319
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't feel right giving a fair review

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
On a Japanese game when I don't understand how to get into

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Some of the modes and look at the extra stuff

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It does, yeah

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Loki has no problem answering that

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The parts I've seen so far

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Feel like Smash Bros. Melee

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
1.5 a little bit

327
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Because it's like the same kind of engine

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The same stuff with just some new characters

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But I realize that's not being totally fair

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In saying that because I haven't looked at everything

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Outside of just the brawling

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But it does seem like, you know, there's a lot of the stuff

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They just copied right on over from the GameCube version

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Very interesting

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Frisbee says Halo 3 feels like

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Halo 2.5

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's a little bit that

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know how to say it

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So that was my gaming week

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So if that's everybody's gaming week

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Then we will move on to talking about some news

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But for some housekeeping

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Of which we have nothing special of note

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What's that?

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What's that? I forget

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The award contest thing that's going on through all games

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's like three months old

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't believe you just saw that

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I did just see that

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Hey, I don't read, you know

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I unfortunately don't read their website

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Or their forums

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're just too busy

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Doing other things

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I will give it a mention on air

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't even know if it's still going on

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I think it's kind of funny that Loki took so long to find it

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I posted a link on the forums

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let me see

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
December 27th

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I didn't even notice it

363
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
All games

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Which our show runs on

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We syndicate on their network

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They play us Monday nights

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I want to say

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And then Tuesday mornings

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
At 9am

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No, because they do their regular

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
All games show at 10 now

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings

373
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But I know our show is syndicated on their network

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Mondays and Tuesdays, supposedly

375
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
As a best affiliate podcast

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And it's all going on in their forums

378
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The voting

379
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I would think it's already over

380
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Three months ago

381
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But then again, the topics are still up

382
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Who knows, maybe it's an ongoing thing

383
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
From yesterday to today

384
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They've put the votes

385
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
As anonymous so you can't see

386
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What each podcast has

387
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yesterday it didn't have it that way

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And Tigerclaw says, Sky, they still haven't announced

389
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The winners, so I guess it is ongoing

390
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
For three months now

391
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And Tigerclaw, I know listens to all games

392
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Every other day

393
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't know

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I voted for us

395
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, I appreciate the support

396
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I guess, for yourself

397
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby

398
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But he bought a knife judgment

399
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I can't support that kind of behavior

400
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's most unfortunate

401
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He also dropped out of the race

402
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
As of like yesterday

403
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Didn't want to play that game

404
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Alright, well if you want to throw us a vote

405
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's over on forums.allgames.com

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will plug the other stuff I know we always got

407
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We have our live general community at Orange Lounge

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And our Facebook is the OLR

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You can look us up on our social networking sites

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Meet other OLR listeners

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Look at our posts and clips of the show

413
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
We have on some of those places like MySpace

414
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Tons of fun

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Alright, let's get into the gaming news

416
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Loki, take it away

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Ok, so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
From Destination and Playstation

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's the retail only conference thing

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Or whatever

421
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I couldn't go, but other people from my company did

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Bastards

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And of course, you know, some of the news that leaked out

424
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date finally

425
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's officially coming to the US

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
On June 12th

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And that of course

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Not only was leaked out

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But confirmed by Konami

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And they also said that if you reserve your copy

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Of Metal Gear Solid 4

432
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Starting April 2008

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You get Metal Gear Saga 2.0

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
A DVD to catch you up on

435
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
All the stuff that's going on in the series

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
As well as

437
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
A beta code for

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Metal Gear Online

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And then to coincide with that

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And this

441
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't know if this is going to be the official

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You know, remember because the 80GB

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Skew for the PS3 was being phased out

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, there's a new 80GB Skew now

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Same price, but you get

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Controller, all for $499

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Which is not a bad deal at all

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If you don't have a PS3

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Because I know a lot of people would be buying a PS3 for that

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And it's nice that they're actually throwing in

452
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Separately

454
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No word on when that's coming out

455
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But it's supposed to come out around the same time as

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Metal Gear Solid 4, obviously

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So, June 12th and on

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I guess

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Alright

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, moving on to

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Other gaming news

462
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Although it still has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4

463
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Actually, let me

464
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Back up for just a minute

465
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Loki, how important

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is this news to Playstation

467
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Fans, you think?

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I think it's very important

469
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than

470
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The year old MotorStorm

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They needed to update that bundle

472
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Anyways, because

473
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Shit, that game is old now

474
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
To throw in there, especially now that

476
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with

477
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The DualShock 3 controllers

478
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Probably not the 40GB for right now

479
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Because there's a

480
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The one right now doesn't have it

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And I don't know if they're going to announce a new one

482
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Anytime soon

483
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's important

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I think this game is actually one of the first

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Major games for the PS3

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That you can only get on the PS3

487
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And that's

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
A little bit of fuel to Sony's Fire

489
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Although this is the first of hopefully many

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But

491
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Hopefully it does very well

492
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's say Metal Gear Solid 4

493
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Does not sell

494
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
All that, I mean let's say

495
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Obviously the game is going to sell fine

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
At least mediocre

497
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But let's say the game does not sell super duper well

498
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And doesn't move all these new bundles

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Is that going to be really bad for Sony?

500
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Or will they get more chances?

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They may have more chances, but a lot of the stuff

502
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That they're counting on is way later on

503
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Killzone 2 will be another one that moves

504
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Systems, Resistance, Fall of Man 2

505
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Maybe MotorStorm 2

506
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then

507
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Final Fantasy 13, that's so far off

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That I wouldn't even

509
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Consider that anything to wait for

510
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Right now for the PS3

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If you're going to wait that long, you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4

512
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But

513
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
At the same time

514
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't know

515
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It should do very well

516
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But once again, you know, they're also hoping

517
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Blu-ray is going to sell these systems

518
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You know, it's a lot of hopes and dreams

519
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But we'll actually have to see what happens

520
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I mean, it'll be a very interesting spring

521
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
My parents got a Blu-ray

522
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Player, which kind of surprised me

523
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Because they're not usually on the cutting edge

524
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Of all the technological gadgets

525
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And I was playing with their Blu-ray player a little bit

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And it was slow

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It was so slow

528
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And I'm sorry, I know sometimes we get the mail

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Like, you guys always pick on Sony, we hate Sony

530
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Because, you know, if we hated Sony

531
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We would so have a PSP-oriented website

532
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But anyway, it's beside the point

533
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But seriously, it was slow

534
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And clunky, it reminded me

535
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's just first generation stuff

536
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, the first DVD player we ever had

537
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Was kind of slow and clunky, too

538
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I remember when I had a single-speed CD-ROM drive

539
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Now that's slow shit right there

540
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, Rob, you know what?

541
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What?

542
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-ray player

543
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why?

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We got an HD DVD player

545
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Did you? Did you get the one for the Xbox?

546
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes, we did, 50 bucks

547
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh yeah, because they're so cheap now

548
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yep

549
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you think you'll get enough library of movies to go with it?

550
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, I don't care what else Dan gets

551
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You know, he picked up a couple of movies

552
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I don't really care because that's all I'm getting

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
There you go, nice

554
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Alright, well, obviously, Metal Gear Solid

555
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Is one thing many PlayStation 3 fans are looking forward to

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But there's also Metal Gear Online

557
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And we already talked about in a previous show

558
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The Metal Gear Online Starter Pack

559
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's supposed to be going out with Metal Gear Solid 4

560
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, they're going to be beta testing

561
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Metal Gear Online in late April

562
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But here's the deal

563
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4

564
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You will get

565
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Guaranteed access

566
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
To this limited beta

567
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a little bit reminiscent

568
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It seems to me like the crackdown Halo 3 thing

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think

570
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There you go, but I'm sure

571
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Most people that would be into Metal Gear Online

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4

573
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This is just incentive, I guess, to get pre-orders out there

574
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Which makes sense to me

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That Sony would want that because they're going to want

576
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Strong numbers out the gate as much as possible

577
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
To try and put next to

578
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Halo 3

579
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And what I'm assuming

580
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Will probably be Smash Brothers numbers

581
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And so on and so on

582
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's kind of like their day one big seller

583
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's going to be the number one game for the console

584
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's just

585
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Halo 3 may have

586
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Been the number one game

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
For the Xbox 360

588
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But I don't think it sold that many systems

589
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm sure there's people that waited to buy

590
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
A system for Halo 3

591
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know

592
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game

593
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems

594
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But then again, their system is still more expensive

595
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And

596
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's a little easier now to make that purchase

597
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Now that we know that

598
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Blu-ray is going to be the high-def format

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Of choice

600
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now

601
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And we know when it's coming

602
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Plus now you have

603
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Grand Theft Auto 4 as well

604
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there

605
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But

606
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They can't just rely on these

607
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Couple games to push the sales

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They really need to put out a strong library of games

609
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And they have a lot of catching up to do

610
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Alright, well

611
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
For you Metal Gear Solid fans

612
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You might want to go pre-order the game if you want to check out the

613
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Online beta

614
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you don't already have it pre-ordered

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Which I'm sure many of you do

616
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Well, there had been

617
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Talk that Metal Gear Solid was going to be ported

618
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
To Playstation 2

619
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's actually not happening

620
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The Metal Gear

621
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Metal Gear Solid essential collection

622
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Is going to be on two DVDs

623
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's supposed to be out

624
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
On March 18th

625
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
For $29.99

626
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Over here in the US

627
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's going to be a Playstation 1 game

628
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's awesome

629
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Well, I mean, there would be no point to really remake

630
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You know

631
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Metal Gear Solid for Playstation 2

632
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Maybe there were people that were hoping that

633
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Some of the, cause you know there was the GameCube one

634
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills

635
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
When it came out?

636
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think so

637
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Maybe people were hoping some of those extra frills would come over

638
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm surprised that they didn't put

639
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Metal Gear Solid 1

640
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And then also have like VR

641
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Missions as well

642
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, my theory is that they are going to

643
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This is again just my theory

644
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Because really

645
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The VR Missions was part of Metal Gear Solid

646
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Integral

647
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Which was basically Metal Gear Solid

648
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
All you need to do is put in the camera control

649
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And you can play it that way

650
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So they could easily

651
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Include the VR Missions and the

652
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I guess integral mode

653
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Hmm

654
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, it's neat

655
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I mean, I guess it's not too, I mean

656
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
If this Playstation is backwards compatible

657
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And all that, you know, at least what little

658
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Backwards compatibility some of them have

659
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's not surprising that they only need to kind of put it out there

660
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
On Playstation 1 format

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Exactly, and if I remember correctly

662
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There's collections coming out

663
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
In a couple weeks

664
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Should be able to pick it up soon

665
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And it's cheap, 30 bucks

666
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Very cool

667
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
A really cool

668
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, you know, not cool for me because I already own

669
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
A couple PSPs, but for someone that may not own

670
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
A PSP yet, you can get a brand new

671
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
PSP Slim that happens to be red

672
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
With a giant head of Kratos

673
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Silkscreen on the back

674
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This will actually be replacing

675
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The Star Wars

676
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The same bundle that they've had for a while

677
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You can no longer get those, unfortunately

678
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And of course, it will be coming out

679
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I believe

680
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Next week with the brand new game

681
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Of course, God of War Chains of Olympus

682
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And some other cool stuff that will come

683
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
With this entertainment pack

684
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It will come with a copy of

685
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The Superbad UMD

686
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
As well as a voucher to download

687
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Syphon Filter Combat Ops

688
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
From the PC Playstation Store

689
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Now here's

690
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
My only little problem with this whole thing

691
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Usually these entertainment packs come with

692
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
A 1GB memory stick

693
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I have heard no mention of a 1GB memory

694
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Stick with this, so

695
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yay, I can download a game to nothing

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You have to buy a memory stick separately

697
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Way to go, awesome

698
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This might be a bad idea

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But do you think we're just supposed to assume

700
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's there anyway?

701
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I don't think it is, because they would have mentioned it

702
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It would have been a selling point, but

703
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You know, hey, surprise me

704
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Maybe it is in there, but

705
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm just going to take a while to guess

706
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And seeing as they didn't mention it

707
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And I don't think it was in the press release

708
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Although I will double check in just a second here

709
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm pretty sure it does not

710
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Come with a memory stick, which is kind of sad

711
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Now, Alpha Canagram in chat says

712
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Loki, bigger sizes are dirt cheap

713
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
1GB is useless

714
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That's fine, okay, but the fact is

715
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's still stupid to offer

716
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
A free downloadable game

717
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A voucher or whatever

718
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's worth, I guess, 10 bucks

719
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
When you don't have anything to store it to

720
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Well, here's my thought

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What about the fact that

722
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
My roommate was hooking up a new printer today

723
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And it didn't come with a USB cable

724
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
To hook it up to the computer

725
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So it's kind of that same logic to me

726
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Battery's not included, except now it's other things

727
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Memory not included

728
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I understand, buying a game console

729
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Back in the day, it didn't come with a memory card

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You had to buy a memory card

731
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
To save your games and stuff

732
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's completely optional

733
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But, I mean, come on

734
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Got a War Chains of Olympus

735
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You're going to need a memory stick

736
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's just kind of annoying that you get it all home

737
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Or something, you get it for Easter

738
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Or something like that

739
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's like, yeah, I'm ready to play this game

740
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Aw shit, I gotta go drive back down to the store

741
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
To pick up a memory stick

742
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I don't know, I think it's still kind of cheap

743
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But whatever

744
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If that's kind of your thing

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Then go ahead and purchase it

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And it'll probably be limited

747
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Since the last one was too

748
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Although I think most people

749
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That are all crazy about God of War

750
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Most of them probably already have a PSP, don't you think?

751
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's always what amazes me about these bundles

752
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That come out so much later

753
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But, oh yeah, this is also coming out in June-ish

754
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I mean, around that time frame

755
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So it's going to be three months after

756
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The game actually comes out

757
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't know, it's cool I guess

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
If you don't have one yet

759
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You might think about picking this up

760
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
To be honest, the only reason I picked up

761
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
My Daxter bundle was because it was the only thing

762
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Available at the time, so

763
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It wasn't like I really wanted to play Daxter

764
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Another comment from chat

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
From Ake Ripper, I think that is

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
A-K-E Ripper

767
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's chat.orangelandstranger.com

768
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Says, still, one gigabyte, you don't get far

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You know what?

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm using my 16 memory

771
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
16 megabyte memory stick

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That came with my original PSP

773
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Or 32 or whatever it is

774
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The original one from the first PSP bundle

775
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Hey, you know what? That's fine

776
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's the thing right now

777
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Say you can't

778
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Just throw in a 32 meg one

779
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah, I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later

780
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But hey, you know what? At least it will get you through

781
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Being able to save your game

782
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box

783
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And I'm sure since those

784
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
1 gigabyte memory sticks are, what, 30 bucks now

785
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The 32 megabyte one should be like 50 cents

786
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
If that

787
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I mean, so come on

788
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Just dump that shit

789
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Hey, I'm not alone

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We have another chat.orangelandstranger.com

791
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And I cannot pronounce this name for the life of me

792
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's T-V-V-I-C-H-M-A-N

793
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Tovitchman? I don't know

794
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Says, I still use my 32, so I'm not alone

795
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So, there you have it

796
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Well, you know

797
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
A lot of people are very excited about home

798
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Even though it keeps kind of getting pushed back

799
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And pushed back, but you know what they say

800
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
As long as there's reason and purpose

801
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Behind pushing it back

802
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Because it isn't all necessarily a bad thing

803
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Apparently

804
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Some big Sony games are going to be

805
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Integrated in home, and those games are

806
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Warhawk, Uncharted, Drakes, Fortune, and Resistance

807
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Follow Man, and assumably

808
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
These are just three to start, and you know, obviously

809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
More would follow

810
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I imagine other big titles, even from third party publishers

811
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Would be included here too

812
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Warhawk is going to let eight people

813
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Meet in like a war room area

814
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Prior to a match

815
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And you can make out your strategies on a sand table

816
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That's like a replica of the different levels in the game

817
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And then you go right from there

818
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Into your match

819
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So, kind of cute

820
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And then Resistance and Uncharted

821
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Basically, your avatars can go into levels

822
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
From those games

823
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And that would allow you to get to parts of the game

824
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That are even completely unseen

825
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
In addition to that, Uncharted is supposed to have

826
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
A 2D shooter game that's built into it

827
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That launches from home

828
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So that's some cool ideas

829
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That sounds fairly generous

830
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But, you know

831
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I imagine the shooter is cheesy

832
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But it's better than nothing

833
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And it's probably one of those cool little integrations

834
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The news about home

835
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Is very exciting

836
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And it makes me wish it would have been out a lot sooner

837
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But, you know, okay

838
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
If the delays are making it better, then it's hard to complain

839
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's all part of their plan to hopefully get more momentum

840
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I mean, this is also stuff that they can say

841
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Look, here, Live does not have this

842
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This is why you should buy a PS3

843
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
They're giving us reasons now

844
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
They're selling a system

845
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Which is what they should have been doing since the beginning

846
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Frisbee in chat says

847
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Push it back until no one cares, am I right?

848
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't know, but the more they drop little tidbits like this

849
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's hard to ignore

850
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, but at the same time, though

851
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's like, you know, Duke Nukem Forever

852
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Come on, dude

853
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I would like to see a little more video of this stuff in action

854
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Not just screenshots

855
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You know, just because

856
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Video helps you get so much more of a sense

857
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Of what it really looks like than pictures

858
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I mean, the trophy room thing

859
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's kind of neat, I guess

860
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But at the same time, I'm just like, whatever

861
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room

862
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And see a stupid dragon from Lair

863
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'd be like, wow

864
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Testament that you played Lair

865
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Man, you suck

866
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Well, you know what, though, Xbox is the same thing with the achievements

867
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You know, you get certain achievements

868
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Well, it's like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room

869
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Of, like, achievements that they've earned during, like, you know, Totem Ball

870
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Or some shit

871
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This is where I played the game for ten hours or something

872
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Wow, you have dedication

873
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You press start

874
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Achievement unlocked

875
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Wasn't that one in the Simpsons game?

876
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Or Avatar

877
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You hit something eight times in a row

878
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
One thousand points unlocked

879
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
There you have it

880
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't know, Jamie, are you excited about home on PlayStation 3?

881
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Relatively

882
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm excited because it's free

883
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
If I had to pay for that shit, I'm not playing in home

884
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Free is a good thing

885
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Free is a very good thing, it's hard to ignore

886
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Oh, that is a good point

887
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Touche for Jamie

888
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record

889
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Well, there actually is a date now for Dual Shock 3

890
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Over here in the US

891
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We're getting it on April 15th

892
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
For $54.99

893
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And I don't want that for my birthday

894
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So nobody get it for me

895
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But it's, I mean

896
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's basically

897
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Basically, from what I can tell in here, the 6-axis with vibration, so...

898
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So basically it's the controller that should have come out the first time, it's finally coming out.

899
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, except for all the crappy legal problems they were having.

900
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Wait, what was the price again on that?

901
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's $54.99.

902
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
$54 bucks for a freaking controller. But then again, Xbox is just as bad, right? Isn't it like $59 for their wireless?

903
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
$49.

904
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's the same price as their current controllers. You see, he rumbles $5 extra.

905
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I guess...

906
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That is too damn much for a controller.

907
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Wait, no, I actually rumble, well, tilt sensors in rumble are, you know, $5 extra.

908
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Well, it is also wireless.

909
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But still...

910
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah, the wireless controller, I don't know, it's a...

911
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't give Xbox a pass here either, I think their controllers are way too expensive too, I think.

912
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And then you get the Wii one, it's just as bad too.

913
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah, the Wii's bad.

914
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Controllers are way too damn much money.

915
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah, yeah, but I have to say something though for the Xbox 360 controllers, that the keyboard attachment is cool.

916
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Really?

917
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh yeah.

918
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I haven't even really played with one ever.

919
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the remote and nunchuck, because the remote's $40 and the nunchuck's $20, so it's $60 altogether.

920
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I don't know, I guess maybe for some reason I let Nintendo slip by a little more, and I know people want to call it fanboyism, but I don't.

921
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Here's my logic, I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price because that controller is really kind of like the core of the system and the motion and everything,

922
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
but I don't know, I guess one could argue that it's the same thing on the Playstation 3.

923
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't know, but the motion shit on the Playstation 3 is very kind of...

924
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Last minute?

925
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Not really last minute, but just kind of, well, a little last minute, but just kind of useless, I think.

926
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I like this comment from Alpha Canagram in chat, he says,

927
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Sky, wait, Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube was most expensive.

928
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's true, because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance with cable, and if you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles, you had to get four of those.

929
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You know we actually still kept our Game Boy Advances for that reason?

930
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah.

931
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So that we could play Pac-Man Versus?

932
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I was going to say, I can only think of like three games that even use that feature, no, four, because Animal Crossing was one.

933
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And yeah, Animal Crossing, Pac-Man Versus, Crystal Chronicles, and Zelda.

934
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Zelda.

935
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
For sorts.

936
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah, and that's really it, just a handful of games.

937
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But Pac-Man Versus is awesome.

938
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii start to see more of that stuff, too.

939
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Well, didn't Pac-Man Versus come out on the Namco Museum DS?

940
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yes, that's right.

941
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That's pretty cool.

942
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It is pretty cool.

943
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Not enough to get me to buy Namco games all over again, those classic collections that I keep re-releasing.

944
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Random thoughts, speaking of classic collections, that just kind of make me go, huh.

945
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I was randomly at a record store earlier this week, because I was, gasp, shock and awe, buying a CD.

946
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I know, I know.

947
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I was actually buying a CD, and this place sells video games as well, they sell used video games.

948
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And I actually saw on the play, and I was actually looking at old Genesis and Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything really cool in the retro stuff.

949
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It was all sports.

950
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It was all sports stuff.

951
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL, so that's pretty much all they had.

952
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But one thing I noticed on the PlayStation 2 was an Activision anthology, and I never even knew this game existed.

953
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Because the Activision releases an anthology on every system.

954
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You know, they had one on PlayStation 1, they've had one on the PC, I actually own the one on PC.

955
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They've had a ton of them.

956
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I didn't realize they had one on PlayStation 2, but I just thought it was funny, because I'm reading the back of the box, like all the games that are in it.

957
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And this is how they're selling the game, is that A, it talks about, you can do cool effects to the games while you're playing.

958
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Like, you can play Pitfall, but it's in a cube or something.

959
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But then the other thing, I thought it was really funny, because it lists all these games, and underneath that it says,

960
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Never before seen in an Activision compilation, Pitfall 2 and some of these other really obscure Activision games.

961
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure, but the other ones that were listed were very obscure.

962
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Like, Bridge. What's that?

963
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I think I'm going to order a freeloader.

964
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You're going to order the Activision one? What?

965
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
No, a freeloader.

966
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh, freeloader. Oh.

967
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh.

968
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We'll talk more about that a little later, I bet.

969
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So, another person jumping from the Sony ship would be Phil Harrison.

970
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
He's actually resigned from Sony Computer Entertainment, which is sad, because that only leaves Kaz left.

971
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And, luckily though, it's not, was it not, oh God, the crazy guy.

972
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Ken Kutaragi.

973
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Ken Kutaragi, yeah. Thank God he's not the only one left piloting this boat here.

974
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But, no, that does leave Kaz. I believe there were some rumors on where he was going to go,

975
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,000
including, you know, Atari to, I don't know why he would jump from one ship to another sinking ship, but whatever.

976
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But, sad to see him go, because he was actually kind of a voice of logic, I guess, for the company.

977
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But who needs that, really?

978
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I don't know. But that is weird. If it's true, he went to Atari.

979
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That's kind of like, I don't know, but maybe he can help fix things there. I don't know.

980
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That'd be nice to see them turn around.

981
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
All right, well, you know, with all this talk about Lost Odyssey and what a great RPG it is,

982
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out where they were actually really amazing.

983
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
One of them was Persona 3, and I admit, I did not get to really play much of Persona 3.

984
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is.

985
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it, because apparently,

986
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Persona FES, which is an expansion to Persona 3, is actually coming out here in the U.S. on April 22,

987
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and it'll set you back $29.99.

988
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But the cool thing about it, now obviously this is a PlayStation 2 game.

989
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's not in the current gen of consoles. It's in PlayStation 2, but obviously that's what a lot of people still have.

990
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But for such a low price, for such a huge game, you get both the enhanced version of Persona 3,

991
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and new bonus features, and a new chapter that is apparently 30-plus hours.

992
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So this is kind of like Oblivion game of the year edition, but for Persona.

993
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
For 30 bucks, which isn't bad.

994
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
There's still pretty good stuff coming out on the PlayStation 2.

995
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And luckily though, a lot of the people that put out really crappy shovelware games for the PS2 have now moved to the Wii.

996
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So you get a pretty good crowd, although there are still some.

997
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But luckily though, they've adopted the price point at $14.99 retail,

998
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and you know, you can't beat that, even if it does suck.

999
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Well, you can download a lot of games for five bucks, so I don't know, $14.99 still feels too expensive for me for a crap game.

1000
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You know, Hannah Montana goes to college or whatever the hell they put out.

1001
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
What?

1002
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't know. I pulled that name out of thin air.

1003
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You want to know what status I think that they would make that game?

1004
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
They just might. Patent pending.

1005
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Why don't you go to college? She's rich.

1006
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana or the trailer.

1007
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Well, if I were really rich, I would want to be fully educated.

1008
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
True.

1009
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But then again, if you're, you know, a puppet of Disney, then...

1010
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
In my mind, it's a sitcom, just like Saved by the Bell went to college at one point.

1011
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney Channel stars need to go to college at some point.

1012
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That would have saved Brittany from her fate.

1013
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Perhaps.

1014
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Goofy goes to college.

1015
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Garsh.

1016
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Can I read the next story, please?

1017
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You may.

1018
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Well, Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out.

1019
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It says it will be out in time for the winter holiday to be politically correct.

1020
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm so excited that they're releasing game on Festivus.

1021
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Decemberween.

1022
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Gives you something to celebrate.

1023
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?

1024
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It's island themed.

1025
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Which is so, you know, wintery.

1026
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That might be kind of fun, though.

1027
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I did think the first one had too much dirt.

1028
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
This one seems to have plenty of dirt, too.

1029
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's in the middle of a desert.

1030
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm sorry.

1031
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Too much dirt for you.

1032
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Although, you know what, I really have to say that the artist's joystick where we got this information from are very creative.

1033
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon, because I don't think they've done a good off-road moon racing game.

1034
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Actually, there was Cruis'n World.

1035
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX?

1036
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Cruis'n World had you go play on the moon.

1037
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And then you ran into aliens that had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub.

1038
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Thank you.

1039
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Malholus in chat.

1040
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

1041
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
We have a lot of new chatters tonight.

1042
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Welcome, all you guys.

1043
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Malholus in chat says, moon patrol.

1044
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I am straight.

1045
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's old school right there.

1046
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Moon patrol.

1047
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That's all the moon game you need.

1048
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?

1049
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Wait.

1050
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You know, I was just thinking, there's all these bastardized Atari games from years past.

1051
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Why didn't they ever put out a bastardized moon patrol?

1052
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That's what I'm curious about.

1053
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Or did they?

1054
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And I just missed it.

1055
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What picture am I looking for?

1056
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The screen capture.

1057
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
They took a picture from Motorstorm and put a pond and a palm tree on it.

1058
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Made out of Microsoft Paint.

1059
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Cute.

1060
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I have to show this in the chat room, because it's hilarious.

1061
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Pretty cute.

1062
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Oh, I just thought of it.

1063
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Hannah Montana goes to her first frat party.

1064
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Hannah Montana goes wild.

1065
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs.

1066
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's inevitable.

1067
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Hannah Montana gets a podcast.

1068
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
They already do crap like that.

1069
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's called the Evening News.

1070
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
There you go.

1071
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Malholus again.

1072
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Hannah Montana goes to the moon.

1073
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
There it is.

1074
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Right there.

1075
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Like, two things we need, right?

1076
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Together.

1077
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Alright.

1078
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Enough of this.

1079
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana, but it's funny.

1080
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
We do not need more Hannah Montana.

1081
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
We need less of Hannah Montana.

1082
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
What we do need more of is more colors in PS3.

1083
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And, there is a rumor.

1084
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I was just thinking that.

1085
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I know.

1086
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
No, I wasn't actually.

1087
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I can read minds.

1088
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's a skill I learned.

1089
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Okay.

1090
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So, there is a new SKU coming out for the 48 PS3.

1091
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I know this for a fact, because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3, the Blu-Ray.

1092
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Because, Sony thinks, you know what?

1093
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Blu-Ray is a winning format.

1094
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,500
We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3.

1095
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,000
You will just buy your own fucking Blu-Ray movies.

1096
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So, there is going to be a new SKU coming out.

1097
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,520
And, apparently, some Circuit City employees have begun receiving their shipments of these

1098
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
new PS3s.

1099
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:51,660
And, on the shipping box, there is a model number, which is CECHH01.

1100
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:58,560
And for those who may remember a while back when we covered that the FCC had an item filed

1101
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,400
from Sony regarding a white PS3 while the item numbers happened to match.

1102
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,960
So, is it going to be the white system coming out to replace the black one with the Spider-Man

1103
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
3?

1104
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Maybe.

1105
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
I don't know.

1106
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
We'll have to see, I guess.

1107
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,520
But, if that's the case, it's going to be coming soon.

1108
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,620
Are there really people that are like, I mean, do these people really, really exist that

1109
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,540
are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3 until they release them in white?

1110
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,360
Or until they release them in red?

1111
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,200
Or what are the colors that we talked about?

1112
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,360
The silver thing that we talked about on another show in another country.

1113
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
I don't think that...

1114
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Are there really those people?

1115
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
I don't think that there are.

1116
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,960
But, I mean, people may be with the DS because it's cheaper.

1117
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,440
But I don't think color is really going to, I don't know, sway you on buying the system

1118
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
or not.

1119
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,720
I mean, people aren't going to go, you know, it's $400.

1120
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,360
If only it were in white, I would really just make the purchase.

1121
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,200
I just need something that matches the drapes and black doesn't do it for me.

1122
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,240
I fucking hate when they come out with new system colors because then they have to come

1123
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,120
out with new accessory colors and new everything colors and it just sucks.

1124
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,200
Lots of comments in chat.

1125
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,800
Brad from Pod Culture says, Skye, I waited till Blue to get my DS.

1126
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,660
With Nintendo, though, it's inevitable that they're going to come out in other colors.

1127
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,920
That is still a little crazy.

1128
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,520
Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing, but you'll notice, whatever happened to the

1129
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,640
pink Wiis?

1130
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
Whatever happened to that?

1131
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,760
And the blue Wiis and the green Wiis?

1132
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Whatever happened to that?

1133
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,960
They didn't need to do it, that's what, I guess.

1134
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,480
SSJ100Matt says, Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3.

1135
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Damn right.

1136
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,280
I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3.

1137
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,840
That would be the best.

1138
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,920
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to join in.

1139
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,420
We do try to keep an eye on Justin.TV's chat room as well, but sometimes I have a hard

1140
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,940
time staying on top of that because that's two different chat rooms.

1141
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,280
That's a lot.

1142
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,680
Something you're going to be able to play on those white PlayStations would be lots

1143
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,320
and lots of games coming to the PlayStation Store.

1144
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:09,040
25 old school titles have been leaked by the European version of the PlayStation Store.

1145
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,480
Well, also, there are some pretty cool titles in there.

1146
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,240
No, there are some very cool titles in there.

1147
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,620
That's what makes me think it's probably fake.

1148
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,620
It's not fake.

1149
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,320
These are from the European version of the ESRB is where they got these titles from.

1150
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,080
Oh, I thought it was a store delete.

1151
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,600
Oh, no, it was the PEGI.

1152
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
I guess leaked the same region.

1153
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:33,360
Okay, is there a version of the, oh, I thought it was Sony that accidentally somehow made

1154
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,760
these visible for a minute.

1155
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,000
Well, then I guess it's legit and there are some cool games coming out because one of

1156
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,240
them, Bust-A-Groove, Holla!, those folks like their old school music games and stuff, very

1157
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,120
excited to hear that.

1158
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,440
Crash Bandicoot 3, Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3, Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies,

1159
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:58,140
Everybody's Golf, Klona, Klonoa, Klonoa's like the best game ever, Kurushi Final, Motor

1160
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:04,080
Tune Grand Prix, Namco Museum 1, 2, and 4, I don't know what happened to 3, Omega Boost,

1161
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:11,320
Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4, Rollcage, Spyro, Tekken 2, 3, Twisted Metal, Vib ribbon,

1162
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,520
Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097, lots of stuff.

1163
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,520
Vib ribbon.

1164
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,520
That's pretty awesome.

1165
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,520
That is pretty awesome.

1166
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,520
That game is crack.

1167
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,960
And actually, I don't know if a lot of people remember, Colony Wars is actually pretty decent

1168
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,920
as far as the space shooter goes, same with Cool Borders, that's pretty fun.

1169
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Omega Boost is awesome.

1170
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,320
Son of Dad says, Intelligent Cube, please.

1171
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
There you go.

1172
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,520
He said, don't they have the PSP one, didn't they come out with like a sequel-ish thing

1173
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
to that game?

1174
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,520
Yeah, they have a couple of them.

1175
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,600
And let's see, Crunky Boy Jr. in chat says, I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared

1176
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
it right up.

1177
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:51,000
Hey, Klonoa was a great game, but it was messed up at the end.

1178
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you.

1179
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Nice.

1180
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,080
So, in other bundling news, in Europe, they're going to get a pretty decent bundle, I'm going

1181
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,760
to say, that is the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle.

1182
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:18,160
And it's a 40 gigabyte PS3, I'm sorry, my apologies, 80 gigabyte, oh, sorry, they're

1183
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,120
doing two of them, my apologies.

1184
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,160
I was just staring at the red box because it's, well, kind of red and black and very

1185
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,400
cool colored, and it's got a silver car up on the front of it, I can't see what it is

1186
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:42,520
though, but they're saying that it's going to be out on, looks like March 29th and retails

1187
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:49,120
for 3.99 euro, so that's pretty cool.

1188
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,000
I love all this hubba loo over prologue.

1189
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
It's not even the actual game, it's just prologue.

1190
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,600
But to be honest, I think this game's going to hurt their sales for the full game.

1191
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,600
You think?

1192
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:05,880
Well, for people, if I had to buy a Gran Turismo game, I don't think I'd buy the full one because

1193
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,940
I don't race 200 cars, there's only a few cars that actually probably race, and after

1194
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:17,120
I play this game, prologue, for however many months until the full game comes out, I'll

1195
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,120
probably be sick of it.

1196
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,960
I'll just be like, okay, whatever, I'm done, I'm not going to spend another $50 or whatever

1197
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,200
to upgrade to have more cars.

1198
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:33,480
Now the smart thing to do would be to release the retail version of Gran Turismo 5 and release

1199
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,700
a $20 update that would give you all the additional cars and tracks.

1200
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,700
That would never happen though.

1201
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,320
RossdielUT in chat says, Loki, Gran Turismo isn't for you, it's for crazed car freaks.

1202
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,040
There's another bundle listed on here too.

1203
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,040
What's that?

1204
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:55,560
A Blu-ray bundle, the 40 gigabyte PS3 with Spiderman 300 and Casino Royale on March 19th.

1205
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:01,480
Now that's reasonable, because obviously now that Blu-ray has officially won or whatever,

1206
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,400
that's totally understandable.

1207
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,480
There's a lot of people that are going to buy PlayStation 3s just because it plays Blu-rays

1208
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,560
and games.

1209
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,440
You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people to do that?

1210
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,600
Because that's how PlayStation 2 won.

1211
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,040
Hey, I bought my PlayStation 2, well actually no, I didn't buy it as a DVD player, I just

1212
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,840
bought it because Armored Core was coming out on it, and I love me some Armored Core.

1213
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,300
Except I didn't buy Armored Core 4, whatever.

1214
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,040
I liked what Akdeft in chat says too, Akdeft says, Gran Turismo 5 prologue, Gran Turismo

1215
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:35,480
5 introduction, Gran Turismo 5, and then Gran Turismo 5 epilogue.

1216
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,320
And yet, no Gran Turismo portable for the PSP.

1217
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,880
It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series, it's like Final Fantasy VII games now at some

1218
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,680
point.

1219
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,920
And they'll have Final Fantasy prologue with cars.

1220
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,920
Gran Turismo.

1221
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,720
There's different kinds of chocobos.

1222
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,400
You get to try out different chocobos.

1223
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,600
You may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5, there are plenty of other games to get your attention

1224
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,360
this week.

1225
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:10,880
Starting things off, we have Bully Scholarship Edition coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360.

1226
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,240
Slightly better than the PlayStation 2 version because it has slightly better graphics and

1227
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,440
a few more missions.

1228
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,680
The game I teased last week, Let's Ride Friends Forever, coming out on the DS.

1229
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,360
Worst name ever.

1230
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
If you're into baseball.

1231
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,000
Or most unintentionally funny name ever, depending on how you look at it.

1232
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,800
There's going to be two games for you, Sony's MLB 08 The Show, and that's coming on PlayStation

1233
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,960
2, PlayStation 3, and PSP.

1234
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:46,740
And then MLB 2K8 coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360.

1235
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,840
We have Army of Two coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1236
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,720
Chicken Hunter on the DS.

1237
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,680
It's a stupid game where you kill chickens.

1238
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,400
So it's not just a clever name.

1239
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,160
No, it's very literal.

1240
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,440
And imagine Figure Skater.

1241
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,880
It is a game where you are a figure skater and you get to do little gay ass moves.

1242
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,600
Yay, figure skater.

1243
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,040
I'm almost offended by that comment.

1244
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,680
I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to figure skater ever again.

1245
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,680
Yeah, exactly.

1246
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,760
Let's see what else we have here.

1247
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:30,000
Also Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC, awesome.

1248
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,840
Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week.

1249
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:41,520
God of War Chains of Olympus coming out on the PSP, that looks pretty awesome.

1250
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:48,200
Pets Bunnies for the DS, yes you two can raise bunnies now, hooray.

1251
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:54,680
Let's see, just a small little game called Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii.

1252
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,400
That will be coming out a week from today, hooray.

1253
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,360
Ninja Reflex is coming out on the Wii and the DS this week for your Ninja themed party

1254
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,800
games.

1255
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:12,000
World Championship Cards for the PSP, in case you want to play something other than poker.

1256
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,120
Mystery Dungeon Sheeran the Wanderer coming out on the DS.

1257
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:27,640
Let's see, we've also got Spitfire Heroes Tales of the Royal Air Force, that's on DS

1258
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,200
as well.

1259
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,320
And Homies Rollers on the DS.

1260
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,560
You like Homies the Clown?

1261
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:39,040
That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures they can get out of those machines

1262
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,040
for 10 cents or 25 cents.

1263
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,640
Oh, my boss used to collect those.

1264
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,600
The uh, let's see, I believe that's it.

1265
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,560
Smash Brothers Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week.

1266
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,100
I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance, but maybe

1267
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,360
there's a certain audience for that, I don't know.

1268
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,080
I will tell you what.

1269
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,180
Uh oh, what?

1270
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,960
Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies.

1271
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,240
Oh no, oh here we go, here we go, okay, yes, yes, if Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a

1272
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,360
million copies, yes, what?

1273
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,400
We'll do the whole tingle thing and we'll burn Eye of Judgment.

1274
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,120
We'll need another game in there, just, you know, more of a chance.

1275
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,040
You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?

1276
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,040
Yeah.

1277
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
Great.

1278
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,240
The makers of that game just thanked you for selling like, you know, about 100 additional

1279
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,560
copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise.

1280
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,040
Here, I'll make it even more fair.

1281
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,480
The combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever...

1282
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, so the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment

1283
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,400
now?

1284
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,400
Yes.

1285
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
Oh, mark...

1286
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,760
Because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell 100,000 copies.

1287
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:48,120
Somebody mark the date and time of this, oh, it's almost exactly 7 o'clock here on Sunday

1288
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,120
evening, March 2nd.

1289
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,440
It will never sell anything, okay, come on.

1290
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,720
Well that's, that's something, that's giving the listeners, that's for the little meter

1291
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,580
some of the chatters made up, some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that

1292
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,880
looks like a telethon thing, and it's like the road to 1 million copies.

1293
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,880
It'll never happen.

1294
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,400
Now it gives them something to add to that.

1295
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,000
It'll never, ever happen.

1296
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,600
Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never, ever sell.

1297
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,460
Here's the thing, here's the thing, chat room, you gotta get him to keep adding games to

1298
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:21,560
it until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total.

1299
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:26,560
Oh yeah, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that.

1300
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,120
Joel Banjo says another one for the OLR wiki, I forgot to mention Housekeeping, this would

1301
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,120
have been good.

1302
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:37,120
They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio, and you can wiki stuff on it, even though

1303
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:43,120
I guess, well we have an official Wikipedia article, but now we have our own freaking

1304
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:49,360
entire wiki, which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really, you'd think I wrote

1305
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:54,700
it or Loki wrote that article, but we've never really worked on that, it was totally the

1306
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,200
fans that did that, so that was really cool.

1307
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,200
And uh...

1308
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,640
I haven't even seen it.

1309
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,640
On Wikipedia?

1310
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,200
Oh, well I thought you meant, oh you meant on Wikipedia, I thought you meant like a...

1311
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,640
Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia.

1312
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,760
A wiki set up for us.

1313
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,200
Yes, but now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki, and you can...

1314
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,200
That's what I was talking about.

1315
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,880
Yes, that, well I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out, it's orangeloungeradio.wikia,

1316
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:22,200
that's W-I-K-I-A dot com, so check it out, and somebody just linked it in chat as well,

1317
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
so check that out.

1318
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,280
Alright, meanwhile, let's go back to traveling the globe and looking at upcoming releases,

1319
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,560
and we'll start on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

1320
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,280
You get a new version of the console coming out, the Xbox 360 Arcade hits Japan, and with

1321
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,340
that comes some price reductions, yay, including Riot Act, which you might know as Crackdown,

1322
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:44,840
and Saints Row gets some price reductions this week on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

1323
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:49,560
Coming out on the Playstation 3, the DualShock 3 makes its way out there, as well as Guitar

1324
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,880
Hero 3, Legends of Rock finally comes out in Japan, the Satin Silver, that's what I

1325
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:01,400
was trying to think of earlier, the Satin Silver Playstation 3 comes out as well.

1326
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:08,080
Continuing our trip in Japan on the Nintendo Wii, Family Jockey comes out in Japan, also

1327
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,960
Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, I did not realize this game had quite the delay between the

1328
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,520
US and Japan, but it is finally coming out in Japan this week, so I guess we're not the

1329
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,520
only ones that have to wait for big titles sometimes, it looks like Japan had to wait

1330
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,720
for this one, that's kind of surprised me, and I look to see if it's a price reduction

1331
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,360
or something like that, it's not, it's full price, so this must be the first time they're

1332
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,920
getting that, so that kind of surprised me.

1333
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,960
Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin, and it comes with a-

1334
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,560
Nobunaga's ambition something.

1335
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,560
I don't-

1336
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,560
Online, I think.

1337
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,960
Well, it comes with what's called a power-up kit, and I'm not exactly sure what a power-up

1338
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,000
kit has in it, so this is something they haven't released yet.

1339
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,200
Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games, same thing with Double Kings or whatever they call

1340
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,320
that over there.

1341
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,920
I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes.

1342
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,920
It's drugs.

1343
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,040
Perhaps, but it does look like another version of Nobunaga's ambition, dang, the last time

1344
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,600
I played this game was on the NES, and look how far it's come, it's like Civilization,

1345
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,040
I remember Civ 1, I have such fond memories of that game.

1346
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,840
And I had a Nobunaga's ambition game that came out the beginning of February for PlayStation

1347
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,840
2.

1348
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,320
Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore, they're too complicated for me, I'm not smart

1349
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,440
enough to play those games, I'll admit it.

1350
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,240
I think that's just exactly what it boils down to.

1351
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,240
They're too much for me now.

1352
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,240
They get too complicated.

1353
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,960
They need a Nobunaga's ambition party game.

1354
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,800
Yeah, they need like, you know how they dumb down Madden for Wii owners?

1355
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,240
That's what I need, I need a dumbed-down version of Nobunaga's ambition.

1356
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:42,160
Swing the remote down to conquer Japan.

1357
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,320
It's too bad they don't have achievement points.

1358
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,520
And I accidentally closed out my list, so I'll tell you what, why don't we go to Europe

1359
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,520
and then we'll come back to Japan?

1360
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,460
Well, you know what that actually makes me think, did we ever get a current-gen release

1361
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,200
of Risk?

1362
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,200
Not that I can think of.

1363
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,200
But wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?

1364
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,360
It'd be cool if we had Risk and Access and Allies, wouldn't that be cool?

1365
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,840
That would be very cool.

1366
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,840
I love games like that.

1367
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,720
Oh wait, I got the Japanese release dates back, never mind.

1368
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,720
Fine.

1369
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,840
Europe can wait a little longer, they're used to it.

1370
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,840
That was me!

1371
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,680
It was, below the bell, I'm sorry, party foul.

1372
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,760
Dear European listeners, please send Rob a smack in the head via email.

1373
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,280
Send me your cards and letters.

1374
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,200
Whatever, they get Mario Kart early.

1375
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,200
Yeah, that's right.

1376
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,300
So you know, shut up.

1377
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,280
Go stuff yourself with a crumpet.

1378
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,280
Hey!

1379
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:38,320
I love Britain, I love all of Europe, I love France, I love Spain, I love them all.

1380
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,320
Alright.

1381
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:44,560
On the PlayStation 2, also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well.

1382
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:51,320
And guess what, as if there wasn't enough Pachinko in your life, Hisu Pachinko Pachi

1383
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,320
Slot Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well.

1384
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,240
By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of Pachinko,

1385
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,200
because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that.

1386
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:11,560
On the Nintendo DS, Bomberman gets a price cut, Doraemon no Bita Ton Midori no Kyojinden

1387
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,960
DS comes out.

1388
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,480
In other words, it's Doraemon on the DS yet again.

1389
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,560
And lastly on the PSP, and then I promise we can do the Europe dates, Dragon Quest and

1390
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:27,160
Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable, that is a combo kit of those games.

1391
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,560
It's like an Ultimate Hits.

1392
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,560
So there you have it.

1393
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,580
And also, Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits.

1394
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:37,600
The Lenneth and what was the other one, Slo-Mera or whatever it was called, they both move

1395
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,160
into the Greatest Hits collection.

1396
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:46,560
Alright, now that all of Britain hates me, and Europe in general, let's go to their release

1397
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,560
dates, shall we, Jamie?

1398
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,560
Fine.

1399
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:54,160
Well these are all on the 7th, and one of them pisses me off, but I have a certain bias

1400
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,800
against it.

1401
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:02,560
Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Blacksite Area 51 on PS3, Bully's

1402
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:08,840
Scholarship Edition, Xbox 360 and Wii, Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed on Wii, Dynasty

1403
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:18,360
Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Jack Keane on PC, MX vs ATV Untamed on a bunch of crap,

1404
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:24,720
Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one, The Destiny of Zorro on Wii, Victorious Boxers

1405
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,720
on Wii, and the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K Dawn of War.

1406
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,320
Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?

1407
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,320
Yes.

1408
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
Oh, Victorious.

1409
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,200
I thought you said Victorias, and I'm thinking like, is that like Victoria's Closet for Men?

1410
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Like now they're expanding?

1411
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,680
I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls.

1412
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,200
You mean Victoria's Secret?

1413
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
She has a penis?

1414
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,040
No, I thought you said Victoria's Closet.

1415
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,040
Oh, maybe I did.

1416
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,640
That was a really crappy show.

1417
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,040
That was Veronica's Closet, it was Chrissy Alley.

1418
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,400
No, Victoria's Secret, I thought I heard her say Victoria's Boxers.

1419
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,240
Maybe my mind is just focused on underwear right now, I don't know.

1420
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,480
See, you said Victoria's, though, and I was thinking that you were bringing up Spice

1421
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,480
Girls.

1422
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,200
They're a pair of boxers, and on the back of them is a big peace sign, you know, like

1423
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,120
the V for victory or whatever.

1424
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,120
A hand doing a V.

1425
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,120
Please let's change the topic.

1426
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,680
I hate Warhammer 40K.

1427
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,240
Why?

1428
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,460
Because I had an ex who did nothing but play Warhammer 40K and paint his retarded little

1429
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:31,480
models on end for days at a time.

1430
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,240
I tried painting those once, and then I saw that they were six millimeters tall, and I'm

1431
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,240
like, fuck this.

1432
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,920
I am not doing this.

1433
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,880
And I'm a big gamer, I love gaming, but there just comes a point where there's this weird

1434
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,880
obsession with the little figures and for building terrain from scratch, and that's

1435
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,880
all he ever did, so yeah, I broke up with him to play with, you know, to hang out with

1436
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,120
some guy that played Rifts.

1437
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:59,320
It was fun, though, running over those little figurines with a toy train, because, you know,

1438
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,640
if you're going to build your own landscape, you might as well already have a train set

1439
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,920
and landscape built already for that.

1440
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:09,520
Well, I can understand having a project, that's one thing, but when your entire life is your

1441
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,600
project, that's a little something else.

1442
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,440
That and you didn't have a job.

1443
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,440
Yeah.

1444
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,400
Speaking about building little figurines, Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spinoffs

1445
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,880
for different games, including Indiana Jones and Star Wars.

1446
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,480
Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo.

1447
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,360
As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue, but they have screenshots to

1448
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:36,640
prove that it's real, you know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts, but sure, if you

1449
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,640
want to believe...

1450
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:44,280
The minute I saw a headline that said, April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was,

1451
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,000
I was like, oh, haha, funny, April Fools joke.

1452
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I hate April Fools.

1453
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You know...

1454
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,420
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

1455
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,240
It would be cool if it were real, I don't think it is, and I don't think you would try

1456
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,240
to...

1457
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
It's not, come on.

1458
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,360
You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine, you know, and of course

1459
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,680
it's their exclusive, they say, and stuff like that.

1460
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:09,600
Trust me, if this was a real exclusive, 1up.com would be whoring the shit out of this right

1461
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:16,160
now, okay, because they like to tease their exclusives, so, whatever.

1462
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,440
You don't need any more Halo or Lego Halo.

1463
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,360
Well, I almost thought this was a joke when I first read about it too, but no, it is true,

1464
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,320
and it's one of the more interesting types of development in gaming I've heard in a long

1465
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,320
time.

1466
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,320
Okay, here's the thing.

1467
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,760
You know Treasure made a shooter years ago called Bangayo?

1468
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,760
Bangayo!

1469
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,760
Okay, well, here's...

1470
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,760
Isn't that a classic game?

1471
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,360
Yeah, well, that's right, it's coming out on the DS, right, as Bangayo Spirits, okay?

1472
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,820
That's not the part I thought was a joke.

1473
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,800
Here's the part I thought was a joke.

1474
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:51,720
It uses what's called sound load, and what you do, you share custom levels, high scores

1475
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,400
and replay videos, but you don't do it using the built-in Wi-Fi or any of that, no, no,

1476
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,960
it's sound.

1477
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,880
That's right, because the DS has a microphone and a speaker, I guess you put the DSs really

1478
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,260
close to each other, and what happens is that the data is turned into noises and sound,

1479
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:12,840
and it's played out the speaker of your DS, and then your friend picks it up on his microphone

1480
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:16,600
or his or her microphone DS, and turned back into game data.

1481
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,120
What a weird concept.

1482
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:23,080
And the other thing you can do with this is you can put them in MP3 format or whatever

1483
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,560
and spread them out on the internet, so people can download them that way.

1484
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,880
It's Treasure.

1485
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,120
It's kind of neat, I'll admit, but I totally, when I first read this, I'm like, this is

1486
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,360
the weirdest thing I've ever heard, but yeah, and then I'm thinking like, wow, we could

1487
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:41,520
like put a custom level on our podcast and be like, okay, Bangayo owners, turn on your,

1488
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,200
you know, and that's probably exactly what they want, which is why this feature is in

1489
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,200
there, but.

1490
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,920
Let's do that, because everybody loves listening to the sound of a modem when you pick it up.

1491
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,560
Or if you put a CD in a, or if you put an old CD-ROM in a regular CD player and you

1492
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,560
hear that.

1493
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:00,520
No, it was like, did you ever put in the Symphony of the Night CD and then listen to the hidden

1494
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,520
track?

1495
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,520
Yeah, but the thing about PlayStation, yes, I have done that, but the thing about PlayStation

1496
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,320
discs is for whatever reason, I don't know if this is the coding or whatever, but if

1497
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,400
you try to play track one on a PlayStation disc, it's silence.

1498
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,980
You won't hear the noise that you will in like an old school, like go find yourself

1499
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:22,000
a copy of Encarta and put it in a regular CD player, and if you know what I'm talking

1500
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,600
about in your old school, because we did this in junior high, we would take a copy of Encarta

1501
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,360
and put it in a regular CD player, and it makes the most hideous noise, and what you

1502
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,100
do is, it was like the dumbass joke you would play is that you would turn the radio thing

1503
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:39,200
up full blast, close the door, and run.

1504
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,440
I guess.

1505
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:48,720
I just remember putting them in, especially, they'd also do it on a PC Engine Duo disc

1506
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,520
and say, this is a game disc, do not listen to this or your speakers will die.

1507
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,880
That type of thing.

1508
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:03,120
Very interesting feature, I have to admit, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought

1509
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,760
to go run out and buy or even really check out just because there's too many other games

1510
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,700
on the table, right, but now I'm kind of like, I might have to look at this game just for

1511
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,700
this feature.

1512
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,360
I'll tell you in one word why I'm getting this game.

1513
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,360
Why?

1514
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,360
Treasure!

1515
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,920
I should have known.

1516
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,920
Treasure!

1517
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,280
There's always one still looking for Chameleon Twist.

1518
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,800
Alright, well, let's move on, that's all I have to say until the game comes out.

1519
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:33,000
Well, I know that quite a number of our listeners are into Rock Band, so something that everyone

1520
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,600
should be happy about is that there is a Grateful Dead pack coming out for a Rock Band that

1521
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:45,680
will have China Cat Sunflower, Casey Jones, Sugar Magnolia, Trucken, Franklin's Tower,

1522
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,560
and I Need A Miracle.

1523
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:52,120
I think that that's pretty cool because Grateful Dead is pretty cool.

1524
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,840
Now I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit because that would be the full

1525
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,440
dead experience right there.

1526
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,840
You know what?

1527
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,120
You laugh about that.

1528
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,440
Apparently, okay, one of my customers, no, no, no, no, no, not about the weed thing.

1529
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,960
No, one of my customers actually saw the kit set up at one of the GameStop's, I guess,

1530
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:18,360
in Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from, and it was actually pretty funny.

1531
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,000
He said it just looks like a fog machine with lights, and the lights basically hook up to

1532
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
your sound.

1533
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,800
They're all sound activated, like, you know, your sound out or whatever your stereo system,

1534
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,560
and they react to the sound that you do.

1535
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,560
So we could do the show, and it would react to our speaking and stuff.

1536
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,560
Just what we need.

1537
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,960
Well, there's a little bit more to this story.

1538
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:45,480
For people who are not so Rock Band oriented and are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented, actually

1539
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:51,920
no doubt having some releases on there, which no doubt cool, Gwen Stefani's solo bad because

1540
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,720
she sucks.

1541
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,280
That and she's got mental problems, but moving on.

1542
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,640
Wow, tell us what you really think.

1543
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,080
What songs are coming out from No Doubt, do we know?

1544
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,680
Don't Speak, Excuse Me Mister, and Sunday Morning.

1545
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,800
So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend.

1546
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,800
That's the song I love.

1547
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:12,200
No, no Just a Girl, no Spiderwebs, but I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list,

1548
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,400
so I'm happy.

1549
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,400
What song is that?

1550
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Don't Speak.

1551
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,400
Don't Speak.

1552
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,360
All right, let's hear some clips of these songs that are coming to Rock Band very soon.

1553
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:22,080
Here's a clip of the Grateful Dead, so if you got them, smoke them.

1554
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,080
Just kidding, that's bad.

1555
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:49,320
Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in Rock Band, and then we have coming to Guitar

1556
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:54,880
Hero 3, we have No Doubt, and I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak, so let's play one

1557
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,880
of the more lesser known songs, which would be Sunday Morning.

1558
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:21,400
At least I'm glad it breathes some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band in general.

1559
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,040
Rock Band and the Wheels keep on turnin' with that game.

1560
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,280
Proud Mary keep on burnin', I don't know.

1561
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,280
Not yet.

1562
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,280
Maybe some day.

1563
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,280
Anyhow.

1564
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:39,000
And not to be outdone, from the studio that brings you Hannah Montana, Disney has announced

1565
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,640
a brand new game for the Wii.

1566
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,920
Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert.

1567
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,920
No!

1568
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,880
It's Ultimate Band!

1569
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,680
Fuck this Rock Band shit, it's the Ultimate Band.

1570
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,800
And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS.

1571
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:58,000
One thing, though, that you will be happy to know, and maybe this might be a sad thing,

1572
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,760
is that there will not be any peripherals for this game, it'll be all with the Wii Remote

1573
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,760
and Nunchuk.

1574
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,360
So you have to imagine how you're gonna actually play these songs.

1575
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:10,840
They have a screenshot that shows apparently the guitar portion of the game, which looks

1576
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:15,360
like it's gonna use the two buttons on the Nunchuk as your fret button.

1577
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,240
So you have two fret buttons.

1578
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,600
You have one, two, zero, or both.

1579
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,420
This sounds like Ultimate Suck.

1580
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:27,160
You know what, I'm gonna say something pretty daring here.

1581
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,040
I think this actually isn't a bad idea.

1582
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,780
Because think about who this game is aimed at.

1583
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:36,260
It's aimed at kids, and parents don't want to spend all this frickin' money on all these

1584
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,660
peripherals that their kids are gonna destroy.

1585
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:44,620
So you know what, if you've got a Wii, why not come out with a game that's very similar

1586
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,280
to Rock Band, but that you don't have to buy all this extra shit for?

1587
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,180
And of course I'm not gonna like it, probably Jamie, Matt, they're not gonna like it.

1588
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,720
It's not really made for us, it's a kid's game.

1589
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:59,560
I'll try it, but you know, I don't think I'd buy this game, but I'll try it.

1590
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:05,460
It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays, and the DS version will have that

1591
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:10,120
brand new dgamer online social network, which is sounding pretty awesome, and I really kind

1592
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:15,080
of want to check it out, but that means I have to buy a Disney DS game, and I don't

1593
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,080
know.

1594
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:23,520
ActDeft in chat says, Sky speaks the truth, and GS68 says, Sky is right, ego plus plus.

1595
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,240
The chat room actually just reminded me of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming

1596
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,240
week.

1597
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,240
What's that?

1598
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,240
Oh, I bought Parappa.

1599
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,240
Oh, rad.

1600
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,240
For $15.

1601
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,240
Nice.

1602
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,920
At a Hollywood going out of business.

1603
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,000
Let's see, RossTealUT says, Sky, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the

1604
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
flames will disagree.

1605
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Yeah, well, he's a freak.

1606
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,240
Hey, did I just call a seven-year-old a freak?

1607
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,240
Cool.

1608
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,360
That's fine, he's a freak.

1609
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:51,360
Uni in chat says, Kids already nom-nomed the hell out of the Wii remote.

1610
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:57,760
Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii remote and hid it under the couch.

1611
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,920
If your seven-year-old nom-noms the Wii remote and hides it under the couch, you got issues.

1612
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,840
I like that phrase, that's funny.

1613
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,840
What, nom-nom?

1614
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,840
Nom-nom.

1615
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,880
Didn't you hear, everything is Caturday now.

1616
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:10,880
Everything.

1617
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,000
Low cat speak.

1618
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,240
Cronky Boy Jr. tries to put out a zinger here saying, You mean we save money on Wii peripherals?

1619
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,240
But I'm bummed.

1620
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,240
Get it?

1621
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,240
Because the remotes are so fucking expensive.

1622
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,680
They don't really have real Wii peripherals.

1623
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:26,240
I mean, after all, there's like, what, the classic controller and the nunchuck.

1624
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,440
That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii.

1625
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,040
Everything else is plastic shit.

1626
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,120
All right.

1627
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,840
Well, you know, a lot of folks are very excited about this.

1628
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,200
I'm sure Mo, remember Mo from a couple weeks ago?

1629
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,200
Yes.

1630
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,800
I'm sure she's very excited about this.

1631
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,000
Still Alive is going to be coming to Rock Band.

1632
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,520
And Valve threw a little party at Game Developers Conference, and get this, some guy actually

1633
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,520
tried to steal the song.

1634
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,480
Okay, here's how it worked, is that Jonathan Coulton was up on stage with his band, they

1635
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:02,200
were playing Still Alive, but in Rock Band, because apparently he didn't get 100% on vocals,

1636
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,640
which is ironically hilarious, but whatever.

1637
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:11,100
So they finish, crowd is cheering, and what happens is that this guy from the crowd gets

1638
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:16,420
up on stage, walks over to the 360, pulls out a memory card, which I don't know who

1639
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,680
carries 360 memory cards with him on the go.

1640
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,240
I mean, back in the day, I used to carry a PlayStation memory card when I go to the arcade

1641
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,600
and stuff, or, you know, because DDR machines had the memory card slots.

1642
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,720
They have two or three of those.

1643
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,040
I can't think of any reason why you would put like a 360 card in your pocket everywhere

1644
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,040
you go.

1645
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,880
You go to this Game Developers Conference, whatever.

1646
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,600
So he pulls out this memory card, he puts it in, messes around, and then finally, one

1647
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,280
of the harmonious guys walks over and says, what's going on, and this guy says, I'm just

1648
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,880
grabbing Still Alive, everyone needs to be able to play this.

1649
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:49,240
Well, the developer, you know, took it back and deleted the thing off the card, and you

1650
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,240
know, all is well.

1651
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,880
Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway, because it was probably a dev

1652
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,640
360, and I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild.

1653
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,240
It wouldn't have worked anyways because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management,

1654
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,080
which we'll get into later, but...

1655
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,080
Right.

1656
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,640
Well, apparently, the guy actually wrote about it.

1657
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,880
The only reason I'm not giving this Idiot of the Week award, or Stupid Guy of the Week,

1658
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,600
or whatever we're calling it here, award, is because apparently the guy wrote about

1659
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,760
it in his LiveJournal, and I don't know, don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate.

1660
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,280
It could be fanfic or some shit, I don't know, but I think it's legit.

1661
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:30,080
You can check it out on his LiveJournal, it's algorithmancy.livejournal.com, that's A-L-G-O-R-I-D.

1662
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:35,760
I-T-A-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com, and he writes in this entry on February 21st, 2008.

1663
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,000
He writes his side of the story, and he puts a disclaimer at the end, he says, don't try

1664
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
this at home.

1665
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,780
The only reason I did, because I am an acquaintance of Alex, who works at Harmonix, as well as

1666
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:49,160
good friends with several Harmonix folks, and game industry friends give each other

1667
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:53,060
free swag all the time, remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material

1668
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:56,060
is theft.

1669
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,480
You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?

1670
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,480
Huh?

1671
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,480
He's got a cool LiveJournal name, that's it.

1672
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,280
It was kind of a dumb thing to do, but at least he admits it was a little...

1673
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,960
It was a lot of a dumb thing to do.

1674
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,400
At least he kind of admits in his LiveJournal thing, though, that it was a lot of dumb,

1675
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:15,040
so you know, I'm not going to stupid award him when he begs for mercy.

1676
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,040
Is that...

1677
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,520
That's what you get when you drink lots of alcohols.

1678
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,520
Exactly.

1679
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:22,800
Alcohol bad, but still alive good.

1680
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,560
Alright, before we wrap up...

1681
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,560
Huh, what's that?

1682
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,040
I said quite.

1683
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,920
Before we wrap up, are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in the studio?

1684
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,920
No.

1685
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,920
Did you hear our idea?

1686
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,360
I don't remember if this is the week you were gone, because February was all fucked up,

1687
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,920
but were you here the week we had the idea that when it comes out, we'll get Mo back,

1688
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,040
and she'll be our vocalist, and we'll get Matt to play drums, you can play guitar, you

1689
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:46,240
and I can work out the guitar somehow, and we'll have an OLR band, and we'll do our rendition.

1690
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,240
Was it last week?

1691
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,240
I can't remember.

1692
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,560
I'm getting old, and the weeks blend together.

1693
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,560
That's okay, Rob.

1694
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,560
Anyhow...

1695
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:55,120
No, I'm still bringing you your birthday present.

1696
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,120
Sweet.

1697
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:01,360
Alright, speaking of getting old, the older we get, the more we reminisce about the classic

1698
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:06,360
games, and that's why we like to pay tribute to the Classic Game of the Week every week.

1699
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:11,520
Dark Sakura likes to respect her elders in the gaming world by paying tribute to old

1700
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:18,280
classic games, so let's dust off a dusty game and see what Dark Sakura's picked for this

1701
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,600
week's Classic Game of the Week.

1702
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,600
What is it?

1703
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:26,880
This is actually one of my favorite arcade games ever, and I have it on Saturn, is Cybertroopers

1704
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:37,040
Virtual On, which is a 3D robot fighting game done from a behind-the-view of your own character

1705
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,380
who you're playing.

1706
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,840
Let's take a listen.

1707
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:50,560
This is actually my favorite game of the week too, which is why I picked that, and almost

1708
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,920
every other sample of it online was horrible.

1709
01:14:52,920 --> 01:15:01,640
So, moving forward, you basically play as a virtualoid, you know, a giant robot controlled

1710
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:08,160
by a person, which is actually pretty funny because there are little insert things where

1711
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:13,000
the pilots go in the back of the month for Saturn, and the sequel, Virtual On, or Tario

1712
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:19,280
Tangrum, was a dreamcast, which I have that game too, and I thought that was cool.

1713
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:25,400
You would play as a number of different specialties, like you have the Temjin, which is the balanced

1714
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:35,360
one, you have the Raiden, which is a heavy battle, one really strong and heavily armed,

1715
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:45,160
you have the Ampharm, which is one of the fast ones, it uses a tonko weapon, you have

1716
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:54,240
the Belgor, which is a missile launcher, the Dorcas, which is another pretty heavy one,

1717
01:15:54,240 --> 01:16:00,920
the Viper 2, the Basbalbo, and my favorite, which is the Fayen, which is like the cute

1718
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:06,040
squirrel, the Kometa, which is really fast and nice, you have the Zeegratt, and then

1719
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:12,520
you have the Jaguarade, which is, as far as I remember, I think it was one of the hidden

1720
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,520
ones.

1721
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,720
But in the arcade, you had a 2% set up, and it had a dividing wall in between, so you

1722
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:25,840
were like in the cockpit, and it used two sticks to control it, and on Saturn they did

1723
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:31,040
release the twin sticks, and I actually don't have them, which makes me very upset because

1724
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:37,560
I had a chance to get them, they did do an oratorio tangram that was on the Dreamcast,

1725
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:43,040
I actually do have the twin sticks for that, in fact, you remember your ex-roommate?

1726
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,960
We beat him getting them.

1727
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:58,720
We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento, and the guy who sold it to

1728
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:09,000
us ended up being, I do believe, Mo's manager.

1729
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,200
You know, I know, we're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town.

1730
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,040
But at any rate, we came in, we saw the twin sticks for 45 bucks, which was astounding

1731
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,200
at that time, and like, we want to buy these right now, and I was like, okay.

1732
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:32,040
And then a person who's, as far as I knew, his nickname came from this game, came in

1733
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,080
and we beat him by like 10 minutes.

1734
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:38,340
So there were also other versions, there was Cyber Troopers Virtual on Force that was only

1735
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:47,520
in Japanese arcades in 2001, and Virtual on Mars, which was the PS2 release, so.

1736
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:52,000
There's also an audio drama for it, which is kind of funny.

1737
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,720
And then there was a musical one, which was the Fei-Yen robot singing, I actually have

1738
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,200
a Fei-Yen garage kit that I still have yet to put together that I bought like six years

1739
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,200
ago.

1740
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,200
Nice.

1741
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,040
Virtual on's like, tops.

1742
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:11,360
All right, well, that's going to do it, your classic game of the week, Virtual on, here

1743
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,560
on Orange Lawn's radio, and on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a break,

1744
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,880
it is the end of part A. That's right, it's not a short show this week, we're all here,

1745
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,080
it's like you're finally getting a full OLR, now it's like three weeks later after Jamie

1746
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,500
being sick, us having no show and then having a short show, the month of February was screwed,

1747
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:32,880
but there's plenty more of regular, good old fashioned, hopefully unbroken OLR left to

1748
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,320
go.

1749
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,600
Lots of stories coming up in part B, if you thought part A was PlayStation heavy, which

1750
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,360
it was, because there was a lot of PlayStation news this week, which hopefully those people

1751
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,400
that email us every now and then say, you don't show Sony enough love, you guys hate

1752
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,000
Sony, blah blah blah, hopefully we proved you wrong tonight, we have plenty of Sony

1753
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,760
stories tonight, but in the next segment, lots of Nintendo news came out as well, so

1754
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,500
we'll be getting all the Nintendo news in the next segment, and some other randomness,

1755
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,440
such as, what is the guy that created Pong up to now?

1756
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,620
You might be surprised.

1757
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:03,280
So we're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back with more of Orange

1758
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,840
Lounge Radio, right after this.

1759
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

1760
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,440
Hi guys, it's Rob here with an important footnote for our podcast listeners.

1761
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:19,120
There's no easy way for me to break the news, but part B this week was lost, and unfortunately

1762
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,480
won't be hitting the podcast feed, and you won't get that news, we promised, unless you

1763
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:26,160
were listening live and heard all two hours of it being taped.

1764
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,000
So I'm sure you're wondering, what happened?

1765
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,600
Well, what happened is that we were taping the show, so we always do, and we do a special

1766
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,480
little show after that called The Afterbirth, it's only for the live listeners, and because

1767
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:39,840
we play licensed music and stuff that we can't put on the podcast, and as we were taping

1768
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,360
that, right at the very end, we were trying to unjumble some of the cords back here, and

1769
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:50,920
the power cord to the computer got detached, and the whole damn thing shut off, and although

1770
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:56,040
Audition keeps a temporary file on hand, when I went in to recover the file, I made a mistake

1771
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,640
and ended up deleting the damn files, I was trying to make a backup copy of it, and I've

1772
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:04,160
tried everything, I can't get, it's not in the recycle bin, pick the chatroom's brain

1773
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:08,860
on it, it's gone, it ain't coming back, so I'm very sorry, and Justin, I was thinking

1774
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:11,080
March wouldn't be as broken as February.

1775
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:15,480
Anyhow, I guess one silver lining to this is that if you do want to hear Part B, it

1776
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,880
is still archived on the Justin TV channel, so you can go to Justin.tv slash Orange Launch

1777
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,560
Radio, and I believe some of our listeners are trying to make a highlight of the show

1778
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:29,120
right now, now it's become this big lost archive of the show, it's like a collector's item

1779
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,320
of sorts.

1780
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,200
We will try to get an audio rip of that, we're probably not going to put it on the podcast

1781
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:39,420
feed because the audio quality on Justin.tv is not great, our microphones don't hook into

1782
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:44,000
that, it simply goes to our webcam, and the audio is really not great, we'll probably,

1783
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,180
if anything, if we can get an audio rip of that, we'll probably put it on MySpace, Facebook

1784
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:51,100
and all that stuff, unfortunately Part A is all the podcast listeners are going to get

1785
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:56,260
this week, I am so sorry, in six years that we've been doing this show, we've never lost

1786
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:03,280
a show like that, so it's kind of embarrassing and a little sad, especially off of a few

1787
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:08,080
broken weeks in a row, but what can you do, life goes on, I hope everybody has a wonderful

1788
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:12,400
week, happy gaming, and we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week, with

1789
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:28,960
all new power chords in studio, have a good one.
