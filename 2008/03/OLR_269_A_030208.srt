00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:25,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 2nd, 2008, Metal Gear Solid 4 gets dated and bundled, Mario Kart Wii also gets a date and online texting, and could the game Road Rash be making a comeback?

2
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:43,132
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:43,512 --> 00:00:48,457
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura.

5
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:49,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

6
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:50,960
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Miss Dark Sakura?

7
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm well.

8
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:55,043
[SPEAKER_02]: You're well.

9
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:55,783
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

10
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm well.

11
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:57,725
[SPEAKER_02]: You're well.

12
00:00:57,986 --> 00:00:58,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

13
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:01,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well.

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll explain why momentarily.

15
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:04,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

16
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:06,995
[SPEAKER_02]: But first I have to introduce the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

17
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:07,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

18
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:09,077
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Loki?

19
00:01:09,217 --> 00:01:09,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

20
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:10,358
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I don't have anything extra for you tonight.

22
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:41,116
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:09,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And you ran it to the old router, and then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that.

24
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:15,476
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's bouncing wireless to the router, to my laptop, wireless to the other router.

25
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:30,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam, which is back this week, hi guys, is going through this router that goes through Loki's computer that goes to the router in the house, which goes to Comcast and the internet.

26
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:31,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

27
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:32,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

28
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,582
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Uber Geek Tech Talk here on Orange Lounge Radio.

29
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:37,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a wireless orgy.

30
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:38,382
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

31
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:44,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program.

32
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:48,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something for Jamie, and it's actually her birthday present, and it's like six weeks early.

33
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:48,824
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

34
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:52,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early because it's something you have to prepare for.

35
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:53,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

36
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:54,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give this to you.

37
00:02:55,126 --> 00:03:00,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week, so I think this is a good time for me to give this to you.

38
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:01,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

39
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:02,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you go.

40
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:02,828
[SPEAKER_02]: E!

41
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:02,868
[SPEAKER_02]: E!

42
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:28,918
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like close.

43
00:03:29,038 --> 00:03:29,738
[SPEAKER_02]: That's third row.

44
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:31,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Third row tickets.

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,440
[SPEAKER_02]: So quite excited.

46
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:34,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

47
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:35,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, where is this?

48
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:36,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Davis.

49
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:36,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

50
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:37,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not that far at all.

51
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:38,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

52
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:39,744
[SPEAKER_02]: There we have it.

53
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So mark that date on your calendar.

54
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,187
[SPEAKER_02]: It's May something something.

55
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:44,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing that right now.

56
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:45,088
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

57
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy, happy, happy.

58
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:46,709
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

59
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:50,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that would help after a poopy week.

60
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:53,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else.

61
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:55,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew I had to tell you.

62
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:57,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Or get tickets independently somehow.

63
00:03:57,407 --> 00:03:58,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know.

64
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't either.

65
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:00,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I got an email about it.

66
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:02,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

67
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Jamie loves the Margaret show and I do too.

68
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:05,309
[SPEAKER_02]: She's pretty funny.

69
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully she's not quite so political.

70
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes.

71
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,332
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, she's still somebody I like.

72
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:15,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, me and you.

73
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:15,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

74
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:16,293
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

75
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:18,704
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be two there.

76
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:20,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, okay.

77
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:23,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought so because I was like, why, okay.

78
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:25,128
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you have to take me.

79
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:25,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

80
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:26,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

81
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

82
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:28,029
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is so cool.

83
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Rob.

84
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:29,830
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

85
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,311
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

86
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can get to talking about video games, yes?

87
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:34,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

88
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:34,533
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

89
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:35,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're done with Tech Talk.

90
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:37,014
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done with Oprah.

91
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:40,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk video games.

92
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,377
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

93
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,679
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was...

94
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:53,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was interesting because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2.

95
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked it up and then I had other stuff to do because I watched Tron earlier in the week.

96
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:00,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I love Tron.

97
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play Kingdom Hearts because of the whole Space Paranoids level.

98
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:12,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a lot of burnout and I watched Dan play a lot of burnout and I played a lot of Ragnarok.

99
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:14,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

100
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:18,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

101
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?

102
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:22,883
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was okay.

103
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:29,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I played, I actually picked up Poptapon, and I've been playing quite a bit of that.

104
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,766
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that's what I was playing before the show.

105
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:32,266
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.

106
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:33,307
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.

107
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:33,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.

108
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:34,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

109
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:39,969
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to play, but I guess it takes some time to build up your armies and stuff.

110
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:50,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I played and actually purchased N Plus on Xbox Live Arcade, and that game's just as fun as the original N, so thoroughly enjoying that.

111
00:05:51,571 --> 00:06:10,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week because we were having this party we have at the end of every month for our work, and this one happened to be leap year themed, and so they wanted Frogger, and they used my system to play Frogger, so I got to play some of that because no one else was touching it.

112
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:15,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um... I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey.

113
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's actually pretty cool.

114
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:21,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally got to the point in the game where one of the characters dies.

115
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:31,312
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not necessarily a main character, but I was just very surprised on how, you know, everyone makes that argument of, like, video games being art and stuff.

116
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:36,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shit, I think there's a perfect example right there of how powerful they can make the story.

117
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:37,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty cool.

118
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:39,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Um... So...

119
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:42,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about 11 hours into it now.

120
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Still on the first disc, though.

121
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And just taking my time through that.

122
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty much that's it, I guess, other than, you know, the usual Saints Row.

123
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:57,784
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one wants to hear about that.

124
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,665
[SPEAKER_02]: For the five billionth time?

125
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:01,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

126
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:01,945
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

127
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:07,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see, my gaming week, I also played Lost Odyssey, and I had much of the same experience as you did.

128
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:15,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to the second disc, which means you kind of go through some big plot twists in the first event, or first disc, let's put it that way.

129
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:20,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm amazed by the game, and I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flack as it has been.

130
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:28,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, you know, I do understand some of the little complaints about the game, and even one of them I find to be kind of annoying, and that is lack of save points.

131
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

132
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:57,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour before I get to the save point.

133
00:07:57,836 --> 00:07:58,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

134
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:00,118
[SPEAKER_01]: It auto-saves, too, for some things.

135
00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:00,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things.

136
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,240
[SPEAKER_01]: There are checkpoints, I guess.

137
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but not a lot.

138
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:08,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had that problem with save points, but I don't know.

139
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:09,847
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about the difficulty of the game?

140
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:11,669
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that difficult.

141
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:17,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the boss battles were surprisingly tough.

142
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,155
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grind some of the way through there, because a lot of this game seems like it's very quick.

143
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:28,759
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain areas in the game where there's two or three sections of the map and then that's it.

144
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,202
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're on to the next section of the world or whatever.

145
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,504
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very small.

146
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:38,147
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know, it wasn't that difficult.

147
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:41,810
[SPEAKER_01]: You just grind a little bit and get your characters leveled up and

148
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:43,244
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's pretty easy.

149
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:53,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I have the pre-order bonus so I have an item that gives me level 2 guard or whatever so I can block most of the shots and it does zero damage to me.

150
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:54,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, I don't have that.

151
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,478
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something you got for pre-order, huh?

152
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:57,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

153
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully they release that as a download thing later.

154
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,722
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably come later on.

155
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:04,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over to the chat room, because we always have the chat room has their own comments.

156
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com.

157
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:09,968
[SPEAKER_02]: RawSteelUT says, it only sucks when you die an hour without a save.

158
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:16,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of true, but there's also some things where you go through cutscene, cutscene, cutscene, and then you have to fight a big boss battle.

159
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:27,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I know you can skip cutscenes, but even then, sometimes you have to sit there, because some of the cutscenes are rendered with the game engine, so you have to kind of sit there and press A, A, A, A, A, A. You can also, you can pause it.

160
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,406
[SPEAKER_02]: and HitTheBackButton for the cutscenes.

161
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:33,967
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about the ones where they're actually talking to each other with the dialogue boxes?

162
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:34,848
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to A-A-A.

163
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:36,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

164
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, it doesn't matter.

165
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:43,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It's honestly just a tiny little blemish in what is otherwise a magnificent game that deserves to be getting more attention than it is.

166
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:48,633
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as other games I've been playing this week, I have been playing Super Smash Bros.

167
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:52,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl because I was...

168
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:53,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

169
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:12,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, last week I was sick on the show, and I'm happy to report I'm better.

170
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:15,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a sinus infection, so I had to go to a doctor and antibiotics and blah, blah, blah.

171
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:18,924
[SPEAKER_02]: But Loki lent me that as kind of like a get-better-soon type thing, which was very nice.

172
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:21,326
[SPEAKER_02]: He said I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time.

173
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:23,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't actually hook that thing up until, like, Friday.

174
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:26,430
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly why I loaned it to you, because this is exactly what I'm doing.

175
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not playing Smash Bros.

176
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, even before Smash Bros.

177
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:33,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Brawl, I never played Melee very much.

178
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:36,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe once at a friend's house, you know, and

179
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,667
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Smash Bros.

180
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:40,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even touch.

181
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

182
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:43,994
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really my type of game.

183
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:46,478
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun, but, you know.

184
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:49,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I may pick up the US one.

185
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not.

186
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:56,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Gerardimo in chat says, Rob, do you think Brawl lives up to the hype even if it's not in English?

187
00:10:58,003 --> 00:10:58,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

188
00:10:58,504 --> 00:10:59,264
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to tell.

189
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:05,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel right giving a fair review on a Japanese game when I don't understand how to get into some of the modes and look at the extra stuff.

190
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:05,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

191
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:08,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki has no problem answering that.

192
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:11,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The parts I've seen so far feel like

193
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:41,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Smash Brothers Melee 1.5 a little bit because it's like the same kind of engine, the same stuff with just some new characters but I realize that's not being totally fair in saying that because I haven't looked at everything outside of just the brawling but it does seem like there's a lot of the stuff they just copied right on over from the GameCube version so very interesting Frisbee says Halo 3 feels like Halo 2.5 it's a little bit that I don't know how to say it but that's what it is

194
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:44,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my gaming week.

195
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:51,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's everybody's gaming week, then we will move on to talking about some news, but first some housekeeping, of which we have nothing special of note.

196
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:52,715
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

197
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,137
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have something special of note.

198
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,058
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

199
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:58,561
[SPEAKER_01]: The award contest thing that's going on through all games.

200
00:11:58,581 --> 00:11:59,943
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like three months old.

201
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:01,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe you just saw that.

202
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I did just see that.

203
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:05,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I don't read, you know.

204
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:07,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even notice it.

205
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:31,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all games which our show runs on.

206
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We syndicate on their network.

207
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:37,044
[SPEAKER_02]: They play us Monday nights at, I want to say, 5 o'clock Pacific or 5.30 Pacific.

208
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of bounces around a little bit.

209
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:40,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

210
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:44,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think... No, no, because they do their regular all-game show at 10 now.

211
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings.

212
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:50,095
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know our show is syndicated on their network, Mondays and Tuesdays, supposedly.

213
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:52,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard as...

214
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:56,840
[SPEAKER_02]: and Tiger Claw says Sky they still haven't announced the winners so I guess it is ongoing for three months now

215
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:28,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and TigerClaw, I know, listens to all games like every other day or every day, so I know he would know what's up.

216
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:28,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

217
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:32,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I voted for us, so.

218
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appreciate the support, I guess, for yourself.

219
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:41,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby, but he bought a knife judgment and I can't support that kind of behavior, so.

220
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:42,073
[SPEAKER_01]: That's most unfortunate.

221
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:43,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is unfortunate.

222
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:45,054
[SPEAKER_01]: He also dropped out of the race.

223
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:45,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did he?

224
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,095
[SPEAKER_01]: As of, like, yesterday, so.

225
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:49,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't want to play that game, huh?

226
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

227
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,630
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

228
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want to throw us a vote, it's over on forums.allgames.com.

229
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I will plug the other stuff I know we always got.

230
00:13:55,891 --> 00:14:01,592
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our live journal community at Orange Lounge, our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio, and our Facebook is the OLR.

231
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure to look us up on our social networking sites.

232
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:05,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Meet other OLR listeners.

233
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:09,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at our posts and clips of the show we have on some of those places like MySpace.

234
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:10,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of fun.

235
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:11,695
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

236
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:12,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into the gaming news.

237
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:13,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, take it away.

238
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:21,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week from Destination, PlayStation, the retail-only conference thing or whatever.

239
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:24,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't go, but other people from my company did.

240
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:25,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Bastards.

241
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, you know, some of the news that leaked out.

242
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date, finally.

243
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:33,926
[SPEAKER_01]: It's officially coming to the U.S.

244
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,367
[SPEAKER_01]: on June 12th.

245
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:40,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, of course, not only was leaked out, but confirmed by Konami.

246
00:14:41,738 --> 00:15:03,319
[SPEAKER_01]: and they also said that if you reserve your copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 starting April 2008 you get Metal Gear Saga 2.0 a DVD to catch you up on all the stuff that's going on in the series as well as a beta code for Metal Gear Online and then to coincide with that and this

247
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:28,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is going to be the official, you know, remember because the 80 gig skew for the PS3 was being phased out, well there's a new 80 gig skew now, same price, but you get Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3 controller, all for $4.99, which is not a bad deal at all if you don't have a PS3, because I know a lot of people would be buying a PS3 for that, and it's nice that they're actually throwing in the DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that separately.

248
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:35,965
[SPEAKER_01]: No word on when that's coming out, but it's supposed to come out around the same time as Metal Gear Solid 4, obviously.

249
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:38,526
[SPEAKER_01]: So, June 12th and on, I guess.

250
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:41,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

251
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:47,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving on to other gaming news, although it still has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4.

252
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, let me back up for just a minute.

253
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:56,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how important is this news to PlayStation fans, you think?

254
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very important.

255
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:03,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than the year-old MotorStorm.

256
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:09,710
[SPEAKER_01]: They needed to update that bundle anyways, because, you know, shit, that game is old now.

257
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:17,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game to throw in there, especially now that, you know, I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with the DualShock 3 controllers.

258
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:26,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not the 4Dig for right now, because there's supposedly, you know, the one right now doesn't have it, and I don't know if they're going to announce a new one anytime soon.

259
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,411
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important.

260
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:35,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's actually one of the first major games for the PS3 that you can only get on the PS3.

261
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,644
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a little bit of fuel to Sony's fire.

262
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Although this is the first of hopefully many.

263
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,972
[SPEAKER_01]: But it hopefully does very well.

264
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say Metal Gear Solid 4 does not sell all that.

265
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:55,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's say, you know, obviously the game's going to sell fine, you know, at least mediocre.

266
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's say the game does not sell super duper well and doesn't move all these new bundles.

267
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:03,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that going to be really bad for Sony or would they get more chances?

268
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,403
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have more chances, but a lot of the stuff that they're counting on is like way later on.

269
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:30,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Killzone 2 will be another one that moves systems Resistance, Fall of Man 2, maybe Motorstorm 2 Final Fantasy XIII, that's so far off that I wouldn't even consider that anything to wait for right now for the PS3 If you're going to wait that long, you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4 But at the same time, I don't know

270
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:32,592
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

271
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:54,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing with their Blu-ray player a little bit, and it was slow.

272
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so slow.

273
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, I know sometimes we get the mail, like, you guys always pick on Sony, we hate Sony.

274
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:04,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we hated Sony, we would still have a PSP-oriented website.

275
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,004
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, it's beside the point.

276
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:09,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, it was slow and clunky.

277
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:12,126
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminded me, I guess, but... It's just first generation stuff.

278
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:13,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's first generation.

279
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:16,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of think, okay, well, the first DVD player we ever had was kind of slow and clunky, too.

280
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:19,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I had a single speed CD-ROM drive.

281
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's slow shit right there.

282
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:23,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Rob, you know what?

283
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:24,152
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

284
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:26,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-ray player.

285
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:27,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

286
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:28,514
[SPEAKER_05]: We got an HD DVD player.

287
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:29,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you?

288
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:30,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get the one for the Xbox?

289
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:31,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we did.

290
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:31,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Fifty bucks.

291
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:32,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

292
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:34,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, because they're so cheap now.

293
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:35,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

294
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:38,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you'll get enough library of movies to go with it?

295
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

296
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's enough out there to justify the fifty bucks.

297
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:45,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care where else Dan gets here.

298
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:08,672
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the deal.

299
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:15,896
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4, you will get guaranteed access, quote-unquote, to this limited beta.

300
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:20,279
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit reminiscent, it seems to me, like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing, I think.

301
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

302
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,083
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure most people that would be into Metal Gear Online are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4.

303
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:36,748
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just incentive, I guess, to get pre-orders out there, which makes sense to me that Sony would want that, because they're going to want strong numbers out the gate as much as possible to try and

304
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:43,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Put next to Halo 3 and what I'm assuming will probably be Smash Bros.

305
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:44,414
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers and so on and so on.

306
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:45,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.

307
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like their day one big seller that people wait for.

308
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:50,258
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the number one game for the console.

309
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:59,905
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Halo 3 may have been the number one game for the Xbox 360, but I don't think it's sold that many systems.

310
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:02,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure there's people that waited to buy a system for Halo 3, but...

311
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:04,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

312
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:08,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game.

313
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:14,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems but then again, their system is still more expensive.

314
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:29,474
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little easier now to make that purchase now that we know that Blu-ray is going to be the high def format of choice and Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now and we know when it's coming and plus now you have Grand Theft Auto 4 as well.

315
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:33,437
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there but

316
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:35,058
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

317
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:58,899
[SPEAKER_05]: There had been talk that Metal Gear Solid was going to be ported to PlayStation 2.

318
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,499
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually not happening.

319
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:08,420
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that the Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection is going to be on two DVDs.

320
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:15,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be out on March 18th for $29.99 over here in the U.S.

321
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,502
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a PlayStation 1 game.

322
00:21:18,282 --> 00:21:18,862
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

323
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:23,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wouldn't see... I mean, there would be no point to really remake, you know,

324
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal Gear Solid 4, PlayStation 2.

325
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:30,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there were people that were hoping that some of the... Because you know there was the GameCube one.

326
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:31,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills?

327
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,931
[SPEAKER_02]: When it came out, I don't know.

328
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:34,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

329
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:37,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe people were kind of hoping some of those extra frills would come over.

330
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:45,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised they didn't put Metal Gear Solid 1 and then also have VR missions as well.

331
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:58,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my theory is that they are going to, this is again just my theory, because really all the VR missions was part of Metal Gear Solid Integral, which was basically Metal Gear Solid done as a first-person shooter.

332
00:21:58,304 --> 00:22:01,606
[SPEAKER_05]: All you need to do is put in the camera control and you can play it that way.

333
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:06,946
[SPEAKER_05]: So they could easily include the VR missions and the, I guess, integral mode.

334
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:09,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

335
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:11,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's neat.

336
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:23,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I guess it's not too, I mean, if this, you know, PlayStation is backwards compatible and all that, you know, at least what little backwards compatibility some of them have, it's not surprising that they only need to kind of put it out there on PlayStation 1 format.

337
00:22:23,668 --> 00:22:28,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, and if I remember correctly, I believe this collection's coming out in a couple weeks.

338
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,990
[SPEAKER_01]: So, should be able to pick it up soon.

339
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cheap, 30 bucks.

340
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:32,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

341
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:50,236
[SPEAKER_01]: A really cool, well, not cool for me because I already own a couple PSPs, but for someone that may not own a PSP yet, you can get a brand new PSP Slim that happens to be red with a giant head of Kratos silkscreen on the back.

342
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:55,419
[SPEAKER_01]: This will actually be replacing the Star Wars Entertainment Bundle that they've had for a while.

343
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,861
[SPEAKER_01]: You can no longer get those, unfortunately.

344
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:09,377
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course it will be coming out I believe next week with the brand new game of course God of War Chains of Olympus and some other cool stuff that will come with this entertainment pack.

345
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:20,488
[SPEAKER_01]: It will come with a copy of the Superbad UMD as well as a voucher to download Syphon Filter Combat Ops from the PC PlayStation Store.

346
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's my only little problem with this whole thing.

347
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:27,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually these entertainment packs come with a 1GB memory stick.

348
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I have heard no mention of a 1GB memory stick with this, so yay, I can download a game to nothing.

349
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:36,387
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to buy a memory stick separately.

350
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:37,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to go.

351
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:38,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

352
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:42,712
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be a bad idea, but do you think we're just supposed to assume it's there anyway?

353
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:45,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it is, because they would have mentioned it.

354
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:51,339
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been a selling point, but you know, hey, surprise me, maybe it is in there, but

355
00:23:52,683 --> 00:24:04,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to take a wild guess and seeing as they didn't mention it, and I don't think it was in the press release, although I will double check in just a second here, I'm pretty sure it does not come with a memory stick, which is kind of sad.

356
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:08,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Alpha Canogram in chat says, Loki, bigger sizes are dirt cheap.

357
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:09,447
[SPEAKER_02]: One gig is useless.

358
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:16,308
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine, okay, but the fact is it's still stupid to offer a free downloadable game

359
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,464
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

360
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,650
[SPEAKER_01]: to save your games and stuff.

361
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,830
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely optional.

362
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,651
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, come on.

363
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:52,932
[SPEAKER_01]: God of War, Chains of Olympus, and, like, Syphon Filter and this stuff, you're going to need a memory stick.

364
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just kind of annoying that, like, you get it all home or something.

365
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:58,135
[SPEAKER_01]: You just say you get it for Easter or something like that.

366
00:24:58,835 --> 00:25:01,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, I'm ready to play this game.

367
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:05,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, shit, I got to go drive back down to the store to pick up my memory stick.

368
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:07,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

369
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:08,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still kind of cheap.

370
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:09,619
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever.

371
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:14,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if that's kind of your thing, then go ahead and purchase it.

372
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:17,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll probably be limited since the last one was too.

373
00:25:19,456 --> 00:25:24,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I think most people that are all crazy about God of War, most of them probably already have a PSP, don't you think?

374
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,541
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always what amazes me about these bundles that come out so much later.

375
00:25:28,522 --> 00:25:30,863
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also coming out in June-ish.

376
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:32,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, around that time frame.

377
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:35,325
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be three months after the game actually comes out.

378
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:36,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

379
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,308
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool, I guess, if you don't have one yet.

380
00:25:39,368 --> 00:25:41,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you might think about picking this up, but

381
00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:43,624
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

382
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:55,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Another comment from chat from AkeRipper, I think that is, A-K-E, Ripper.

383
00:25:56,005 --> 00:26:00,746
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chat.orangeonstranger.com, says, Still, one gigabyte, you don't get far.

384
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:01,606
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

385
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:07,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using my 16 megabyte memory stick that came with my original PSP.

386
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, 32 or whatever it is.

387
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:11,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using the old school original one from the first PSP bundle.

388
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:11,608
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

389
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:12,088
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

390
00:26:12,248 --> 00:26:13,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, see, that's the thing right now.

391
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:15,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, say you can't...

392
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:18,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Just throw in a 32MB one.

393
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:21,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later, but hey, you know what?

394
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:27,832
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it will get you through being able to save your game of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box.

395
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:31,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure since those 1GB memory sticks are what, $30 now?

396
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:35,116
[SPEAKER_01]: The 32MB one should be like $0.50, if that.

397
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:36,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so come on.

398
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:37,858
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to be sitting on a bunch of them.

399
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:39,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dump that shit.

400
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:41,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm not alone.

401
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:56,173
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

402
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:46,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Warhawk is going to let eight people meet in like a war room area prior to a match and you can make out your strategies on a sand table that's like a replica of the different levels in the game and then you go right from there into your match so kind of kind of cute and then Resistance and Uncharted basically your avatars can go into levels from those games

403
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:50,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would allow you to get to parts of the game that are even completely unseen.

404
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:55,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in addition to that, Uncharted is supposed to have a 2D shooter game that's built into it that launches from home.

405
00:27:56,414 --> 00:27:58,276
[SPEAKER_02]: See, so that's some cool ideas.

406
00:27:58,356 --> 00:28:01,959
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds fairly generous and kind of neat.

407
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:09,927
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I imagine the shooter is cheesy, but it's better than nothing, and it's probably kind of one of those cool little integrations.

408
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:15,587
[SPEAKER_02]: The news about Home is very exciting and it makes me wish it would have been out a lot sooner.

409
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:18,910
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, okay, if the delays are making it better, then it's hard to complain, right?

410
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,991
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all part of their plan to hopefully get more momentum.

411
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:24,874
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is also stuff that they can say, look, here, Live does not have this.

412
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:27,696
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is why you should buy a PS3.

413
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:33,841
[SPEAKER_01]: They're giving us reasons now why you should own a system, which is what they should have been doing since the beginning.

414
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:37,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee in chat says, push it back until no one cares.

415
00:28:37,204 --> 00:28:37,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?

416
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:41,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but the more they drop little tidbits like this, it's hard to ignore.

417
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:45,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but at the same time, though, it's like, you know, Duke Nukem Forever.

418
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:46,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, dude.

419
00:28:46,804 --> 00:28:51,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see a little more video of this stuff in action, not just screenshots.

420
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:57,491
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just because video helps you get so much more of a sense of what it really looks like than pictures.

421
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:03,394
[SPEAKER_01]: The trophy room thing, it's kind of neat, I guess, but at the same time, I'm just like, whatever.

422
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:07,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room and see a stupid dragon from Lair.

423
00:29:07,717 --> 00:29:08,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like,

424
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:09,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

425
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:11,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Testament that you played Lair.

426
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:12,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you suck.

427
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?

428
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,931
[SPEAKER_01]: The Xbox is the same thing with the achievements.

429
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:22,933
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room of achievements that they've earned during Totem Ball or some shit.

430
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:26,094
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I played the game for 10 hours or something.

431
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:27,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you have dedication.

432
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:29,716
[SPEAKER_02]: You press start.

433
00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:30,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Achievement unlocked.

434
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that one in the Simpsons game?

435
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:32,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Madden or...

436
00:29:34,304 --> 00:29:34,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Simpsons, maybe.

437
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:35,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Avatar.

438
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,286
[SPEAKER_02]: You hit something eight times in a row.

439
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:38,968
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,000 points unlocked.

440
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:39,889
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

441
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:42,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Jamie, you excited about Home on PlayStation 3?

442
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:44,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Relatively.

443
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:45,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?

444
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:46,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited because it's free.

445
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:49,716
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to pay for that shit, I'm not playing in Home.

446
00:29:49,776 --> 00:29:50,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Free is a good thing.

447
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:51,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Free is a very good thing.

448
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:52,538
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to ignore.

449
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, Yaris was free.

450
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that is a good point.

451
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:56,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Touché from Jamie.

452
00:29:57,482 --> 00:29:59,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record...

453
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:10,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there actually is a date now for that DualShock 3 over here in the U.S.

454
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:17,284
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting it on April 15th for $54.99, and I don't want that for my birthday, so nobody get it for me.

455
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:26,227
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's, I mean, it's basically the, from what I can tell in here, the six axis with vibration, so...

456
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:31,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it's the controller that should have come out the first time.

457
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:31,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It's finally coming out.

458
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:35,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, except for all the crappy legal problems they were having.

459
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:36,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, what was the price again on that?

460
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:38,739
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a $54.99.

461
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:41,640
[SPEAKER_02]: $54 for a freaking controller.

462
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,260
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, Xbox is just as bad, right?

463
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it like $59 for their wireless?

464
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:45,521
$49.

465
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:47,801
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same price as their current controllers.

466
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:48,661
[SPEAKER_01]: He rumbles $5 extra.

467
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:48,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

468
00:30:52,566 --> 00:30:54,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox 360 controllers are way too expensive.

469
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:19,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

470
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:19,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.

471
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:21,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even really played with one ever.

472
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:29,140
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the remote and nunchuck because the remote's $40 and the nunchuck's $20 so it's $60 all together.

473
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:29,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

474
00:31:29,941 --> 00:31:36,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess maybe for some reason I let Nintendo slip by a little more and I know people want to call it fanboyism but I don't.

475
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:36,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my logic.

476
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:45,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price because that controller is really kind of like the core of the system and the motion and everything but I don't know.

477
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess one could argue that

478
00:31:47,091 --> 00:31:53,756
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing on the PlayStation 3, so... I don't know, but the motion shit on PlayStation 3 is very, like, kind of... Last minute?

479
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:59,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really last minute, but just kind of... Well, I mean, a little last minute, but just kind of useless, I think.

480
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this comment from AlphaCanogram in chat.

481
00:32:01,761 --> 00:32:02,622
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, Sky, wait.

482
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:06,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube was most expensive.

483
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,306
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance with cable.

484
00:32:09,646 --> 00:32:13,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles, you had to get four of those.

485
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:16,111
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we actually still kept our Game Boy Advances for that reason.

486
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:18,597
[SPEAKER_05]: so that we could play Pac-Man Versus.

487
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:24,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I can only think of like three games that even use that feature, no, four, because Animal Crossing was one.

488
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Animal Crossing, Pac-Man Versus, Crystal Chronicles, and Zelda.

489
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:29,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Zelda.

490
00:32:29,242 --> 00:32:29,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Four Swords.

491
00:32:29,942 --> 00:32:32,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's really it, just a handful of games.

492
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:35,985
[SPEAKER_05]: But Pac-Man Versus is awesome.

493
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:41,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii start to see more of that stuff too.

494
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:44,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't Pac-Man Versus come out on the Namco Museum DS?

495
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:45,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's right.

496
00:32:46,954 --> 00:32:47,314
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

497
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Random thoughts, speaking of classic collections, just kind of make me go, huh.

498
00:32:58,922 --> 00:33:05,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I was randomly at a record store earlier this week, because I was, gasp, shock and awe, buying a CD.

499
00:33:05,346 --> 00:33:06,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

500
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:10,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually buying a CD, and this place sells video games as well.

501
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:11,169
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell used video games.

502
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:20,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually saw on the play, and I was actually looking at, like, old Genesis and Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything, like, really, like, cool in the retro stuff.

503
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:20,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all sports.

504
00:33:21,355 --> 00:33:22,236
[SPEAKER_02]: All sports stuff.

505
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:24,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL.

506
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:25,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty much all they had.

507
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,862
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I noticed on the PlayStation 2 was an Activision anthology.

508
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:30,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never even knew this game existed.

509
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:35,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the Activision releases an anthology on every system.

510
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:36,408
[SPEAKER_02]: They have one on PlayStation 1.

511
00:33:36,588 --> 00:33:37,669
[SPEAKER_02]: They've had one on the PC.

512
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually own the one on PC.

513
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,931
[SPEAKER_02]: They've had a ton of them.

514
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:45,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize they had one on PlayStation 2, but I just thought it was funny because I'm reading the back of the box, like all the games that are in it.

515
00:33:46,136 --> 00:33:52,140
[SPEAKER_02]: and like this is how they're selling the game is that A, it talks about you can do cool effects to the games while you're playing.

516
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can play Pitfall but it's in a cube or something.

517
00:33:55,422 --> 00:34:01,446
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the other thing, I thought it was really funny because it lists all these games and underneath that it says never before seen in an Activision compilation.

518
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:07,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Pitfall 2 and some of these other like really obscure Activision games.

519
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:10,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure but the other ones that were listed were very obscure.

520
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:12,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Bridge.

521
00:34:12,492 --> 00:34:12,833
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

522
00:34:13,813 --> 00:34:15,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to order a freeloader.

523
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Freeloader Phil Harrison Crazy Guy

524
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:44,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken Kutaragi

525
00:35:15,535 --> 00:35:15,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

526
00:35:16,976 --> 00:35:17,997
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is weird.

527
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:21,680
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's true he went to Atari, that's kind of like... I don't know.

528
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe he can help fix things there.

529
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:23,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

530
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:26,024
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be nice to see them turn around.

531
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:37,080
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, you know, with all this talk about Lost Odyssey and what a great RPG it is, sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out where they were actually really amazing.

532
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,401
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was Persona 3, and I admit I did not get to really play much of Persona 3.

533
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is.

534
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:52,703
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it, because apparently Persona FES, which is an expansion to Persona 3, is actually coming out here in the U.S.

535
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:53,123
[SPEAKER_02]: on Xbox.

536
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:54,914
[SPEAKER_02]: April 22nd and it'll set you back $29.99.

537
00:35:56,275 --> 00:36:04,881
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cool thing about it, now obviously this is a PlayStation 2 game, it's not in the current gen of consoles, it's in PlayStation 2, but obviously that's what a lot of people still have.

538
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:15,508
[SPEAKER_02]: But for such a low price for such a huge game, you get both the enhanced version of Persona 3 and new bonus features and a new chapter that is apparently 30 plus hours.

539
00:36:15,948 --> 00:36:18,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of like Oblivion Game of the Year Edition, but for Persona.

540
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,651
[SPEAKER_02]: For $30, which isn't bad.

541
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,336
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still pretty good stuff coming out on the PlayStation 2.

542
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:31,339
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, though, a lot of the people that put out really crappy shovelware games for the PS2 have now moved to the Wii.

543
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a pretty good crowd, although there are still some.

544
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:41,062
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily, though, they've adopted the price point of $14.99 retail, which, you know, you can't beat that, even if it does suck.

545
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:48,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can download a lot of games for $5, so I don't know, $14.99 still feels too expensive for me.

546
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:52,160
[SPEAKER_02]: for a crap game, you know, Hannah Montana Goes to College or whatever the hell they put out.

547
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:52,841
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

548
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:53,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

549
00:36:53,742 --> 00:36:55,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulled that name out of thin air.

550
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:57,384
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to know what sad is?

551
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they would make that game.

552
00:36:58,985 --> 00:36:59,666
[SPEAKER_02]: They just might.

553
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:00,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Patent pending.

554
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:02,207
[SPEAKER_02]: She'd go to college.

555
00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:02,868
[SPEAKER_02]: She's rich.

556
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana or the trailer.

557
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if I were really rich, I would want to be fully educated.

558
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:09,192
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

559
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:11,714
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, if you're, you know...

560
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:14,880
[SPEAKER_05]: A puppet of Disney, then.

561
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:19,883
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, it's a sitcom, just like Saved by the Bell went to college at one point.

562
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:24,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney Channel stars need to go to college at some point.

563
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:25,387
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their exciting new surroundings.

564
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:26,727
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have saved Britney from her fate.

565
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:27,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps.

566
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:29,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Goofy goes to college.

567
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorsh!

568
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I read the next story, please?

569
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,131
[SPEAKER_02]: You may.

570
00:37:33,472 --> 00:37:33,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

571
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:39,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out.

572
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:47,457
[SPEAKER_05]: It says it'll be out in time for the winter holiday, to be politically correct.

573
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:50,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited that they're releasing Game On Festivus.

574
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:53,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Decemberween.

575
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:55,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Gives you something to celebrate.

576
00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:59,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?

577
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:04,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It's island-themed, which is so, you know, wintery.

578
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:07,068
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be kind of fun, though.

579
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:10,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I did think the first one had too much dirt.

580
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:12,871
[SPEAKER_05]: This one seems to have plenty of dirt, too.

581
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,572
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the middle of a desert.

582
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:16,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

583
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much dirt for you.

584
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:20,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, you know what?

585
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:28,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I really have to say that the artist's joystick where we got this information from are very creative.

586
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:35,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon because I don't think they've done a good off-road moon racing game.

587
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:36,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually...

588
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:39,723
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Cruisin' World.

589
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:42,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX?

590
00:38:42,484 --> 00:38:44,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Cruisin' World had you go play on the moon.

591
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:45,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Cruisin' World.

592
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:49,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you ran into aliens that had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub.

593
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:51,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Mahalis in chat.

594
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:52,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

595
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:54,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of new chatters tonight.

596
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome all you guys.

597
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:56,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Mahalis in chat says, Moon Patrol.

598
00:38:57,828 --> 00:38:58,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn straight.

599
00:38:58,588 --> 00:38:59,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That's old school right there.

600
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:00,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Moon Patrol.

601
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:01,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the moon game you need.

602
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:04,149
[SPEAKER_05]: But Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?

603
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannah Montana goes to her first frat party

604
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:35,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Hannah Montana goes wild.

605
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:38,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs.

606
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:40,952
[SPEAKER_01]: It's inevitable.

607
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:42,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Hannah Montana gets a podcast.

608
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,294
[SPEAKER_05]: They already do crap like that.

609
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:45,635
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the evening news.

610
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:46,255
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

611
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:46,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Mahalas again.

612
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:48,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannah Montana goes to the moon.

613
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:48,757
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

614
00:39:48,877 --> 00:39:49,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.

615
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:50,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Like two things we need right together.

616
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:51,399
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

617
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough of this.

618
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana, but it's funny.

619
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:56,323
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not need more Hannah Montana.

620
00:39:56,703 --> 00:39:58,004
[SPEAKER_01]: We need less of Hannah Montana.

621
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:00,426
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do need more of is...

622
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:03,151
[SPEAKER_01]: is more colors than PS3.

623
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:06,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a rumor... I was just thinking that!

624
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:07,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I know!

625
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:08,693
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wasn't, actually.

626
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I can read minds.

627
00:40:11,193 --> 00:40:14,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a... It's a skill I learned.

628
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:15,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

629
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:19,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there is a new SKU coming out for the 48-gig PS3.

630
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:26,037
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this for a fact, because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3, the Blu-ray, because Sony thinks, you know what...

631
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Blu-ray is the winning format.

632
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:30,291
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3.

633
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:33,493
[SPEAKER_01]: You will just buy your own fucking Blu-ray movies.

634
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,114
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is going to be a new SKU coming out.

635
00:40:38,214 --> 00:40:44,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently, some Circuit City employees have begun receiving their shipments of these new PS3s.

636
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:49,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the shipping box, there is a model number, which is CECHH01.

637
00:40:51,543 --> 00:41:03,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who may remember a while back when we covered that the FCC had an item filed from Sony regarding a white PS3 while the item numbers happened to match.

638
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:11,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it going to be the white system coming out to replace the black one with the Spider-Man 3?

639
00:41:12,408 --> 00:41:12,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

640
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:13,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

641
00:41:13,729 --> 00:41:14,749
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to see, I guess.

642
00:41:17,665 --> 00:41:19,387
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that's the case, it's going to be coming soon.

643
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:28,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there really people that are like... I mean, do these people really, really exist that are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3 until they release them in white?

644
00:41:29,535 --> 00:41:31,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Or until they release them in red?

645
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:32,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what other colors have we talked about?

646
00:41:33,178 --> 00:41:36,361
[SPEAKER_02]: The silver thing that we talked about on other shows in other countries.

647
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:37,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that... Are there really those people?

648
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:39,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that there are.

649
00:41:39,223 --> 00:41:42,166
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, people maybe with the DS because it's cheaper.

650
00:41:42,806 --> 00:41:44,848
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think color is really going to...

651
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,900
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

652
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:17,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, with Nintendo though, it's inevitable that they're going to come out in other colors.

653
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:19,354
[SPEAKER_02]: That is still a little crazy.

654
00:42:19,774 --> 00:42:24,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing, but you'll notice, whatever happened to the pink Wii's?

655
00:42:24,435 --> 00:42:25,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened to that?

656
00:42:25,095 --> 00:42:26,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And the blue Wii's and the green Wii's?

657
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:27,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened to that?

658
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:29,196
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't need to do it, that's what I guess.

659
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:32,857
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3.

660
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn right.

661
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:36,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3.

662
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:37,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the best.

663
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:41,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to join in.

664
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:48,306
[SPEAKER_02]: We do try to keep an eye on Justin TV's chat room as well, but sometimes I have a hard time staying on top of that because that's two different chat rooms.

665
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:49,227
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.

666
00:42:51,068 --> 00:43:01,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Something you're going to be able to play on those white PlayStations would be lots and lots of games coming to the PlayStation Store.

667
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:05,000
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 old school titles have been leaked online.

668
00:43:05,842 --> 00:43:06,122
[SPEAKER_02]: P.E.G.I.

669
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:28,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Crash Bandicoot 3 Crash Bandicoot 3

670
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:54,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3, Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies, Everybody's Golf, Klona, Klonoa, sorry.

671
00:43:55,149 --> 00:43:56,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Klonoa is like the best game ever.

672
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:00,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Kurushi Final, Motor Toon Grand Prix, Namco Museum 1, 2, and 4.

673
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:02,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what happened to 3.

674
00:44:03,235 --> 00:44:12,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Omega Boost, Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4, Roll Cage, Spyro, Tekken 2, 3, Twisted Metal, Vib Ribbon, Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097.

675
00:44:12,762 --> 00:44:13,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Vib Ribbon!

676
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:14,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff.

677
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Vib Ribbon.

678
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Vib Ribbon.

679
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:16,061
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty awesome.

680
00:44:16,081 --> 00:44:16,902
[SPEAKER_02]: That is pretty awesome.

681
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,405
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is crack.

682
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:26,432
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I don't know if a lot of people remember, Colony Wars is actually pretty decent as far as the space shooter goes.

683
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:27,953
[SPEAKER_01]: They have cool borders.

684
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:28,474
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty fun.

685
00:44:28,654 --> 00:44:29,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Omega Boost is awesome.

686
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:32,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Son of Dad says Intelligent Cube, please.

687
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:33,179
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

688
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:34,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they have the PSP one?

689
00:44:34,941 --> 00:44:37,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they come out with a sequel-ish thing to that game?

690
00:44:37,082 --> 00:44:38,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they have a couple of them.

691
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:44,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, CrunkyBoyJr in chat says, I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared it right up.

692
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:49,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Klonoa was a great game, but it was messed up at the end.

693
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you.

694
00:44:53,305 --> 00:44:53,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

695
00:44:54,525 --> 00:45:02,327
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in other bundly news, in Europe they're going to get a pretty decent bundle, I'm going to say, that is...

696
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:30,560
[SPEAKER_05]: The Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle And it's a 40GB PS3 I'm sorry, my apologies, 80GB Oh, sorry, they're doing two of them, my apologies I was just staring at the red box because it's, well, kind of red and black and very cool colored And it's got a silver car up on the front of it, I can't see what it is though

697
00:45:31,892 --> 00:45:44,267
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're saying that it's going to be out on, looks like March 29th, and retails for €3.99, so that's pretty cool.

698
00:45:49,161 --> 00:45:51,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all this hubbaloo over Prologue.

699
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:54,342
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even the actual game, it's just Prologue.

700
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:58,663
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to be honest, I think this game's going to hurt their sales for the full game.

701
00:45:58,863 --> 00:45:59,143
[SPEAKER_01]: You think?

702
00:45:59,163 --> 00:46:07,525
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, like, you know, if I had to buy a Gran Turismo game, I don't think I'd buy the full one because I don't race 200 cars.

703
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:10,446
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's only a few cars that I'd actually probably race.

704
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:17,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, after I play this game, you know, Prologue, for however many months until the full game comes out, I'll probably be sick of it.

705
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,272
[SPEAKER_01]: www.DarkSakura.com

706
00:46:38,984 --> 00:46:43,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross Steel UT in chat says, Loki, Gran Turismo isn't for you, it's for crazed car freaks.

707
00:46:44,147 --> 00:46:45,927
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another bundle listed on here too.

708
00:46:45,948 --> 00:46:46,828
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

709
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:55,072
[SPEAKER_05]: A Blu-ray bundle, the 40 gigabyte PS3 with Spider-Man 300 and Casino Royale on March 19th.

710
00:46:55,492 --> 00:47:03,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's reasonable, you know, because obviously now that Blu-ray has officially won or whatever, that's, you know, totally understandable.

711
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that are going to buy PlayStation 3s just because it plays Blu-rays and games.

712
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:09,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people to do that?

713
00:47:09,278 --> 00:47:11,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's how PlayStation 2 won.

714
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I bought my PlayStation 2.

715
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, no, I didn't buy it as a DVD player.

716
00:47:15,861 --> 00:47:19,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I just bought it because Armored Core was coming out on it, and I love me some Armored Core.

717
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:22,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Except they didn't buy Armored Core 4.

718
00:47:22,564 --> 00:47:22,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

719
00:47:24,312 --> 00:47:26,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked what Actdeft in chat says too.

720
00:47:26,133 --> 00:47:32,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Gran Turismo 5 Introduction, Gran Turismo 5, and then Gran Turismo 5 Epilogue.

721
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:38,296
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, no Gran Turismo Portable for the PSP.

722
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:40,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series.

723
00:47:40,837 --> 00:47:43,198
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Final Fantasy 7 games now at some point.

724
00:47:44,638 --> 00:47:49,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have Final Fantasy Prologue with cars.

725
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Gran Turismo...

726
00:47:51,264 --> 00:47:53,965
[SPEAKER_05]: There's different kinds of chocobos.

727
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:58,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to try out different chocobos.

728
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5.

729
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:04,127
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of other games to get your attention this week.

730
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:09,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting things off, we have Bully Scholarship Edition coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360.

731
00:48:09,508 --> 00:48:16,089
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slightly better than, I guess, the PlayStation 2 version because it has slightly better graphics and a few more missions.

732
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:16,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

733
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,624
[SPEAKER_01]: The game I teased last week, Let's Ride Friends Forever, coming out on the DS.

734
00:48:23,564 --> 00:48:26,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Worst name ever.

735
00:48:26,306 --> 00:48:30,690
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into baseball... Or most unintentionally funny name ever, depending on how you look at it.

736
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,091
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be two games for you.

737
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:38,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony's MLB08 The Show, and that's coming on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PSP.

738
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:44,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And then MLB2K8, coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360.

739
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:52,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Army of Two on PS3 and Xbox 360 Chicken Hunter on the DS Imagine Figure Skater I'm almost offended by that comment.

740
00:49:15,058 --> 00:49:17,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to figure skating.

741
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:17,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

742
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:21,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else we have here.

743
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:26,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC.

744
00:49:27,545 --> 00:49:27,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

745
00:49:30,087 --> 00:49:32,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week.

746
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:37,831
[SPEAKER_01]: God of War Chains of Olympus coming out on the PSP.

747
00:49:38,031 --> 00:49:39,072
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks pretty awesome.

748
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:42,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Pets Bunnies

749
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Smash Bros.

750
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:46,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Brawl Ninja Reflex Ninja Reflex

751
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:15,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Mystery Dungeon, Shirin the Wanderer coming out on the DS.

752
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:25,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, we've also got Spitfire Heroes, Tales of the Royal Air Force.

753
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:28,174
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on DS as well.

754
00:50:29,034 --> 00:50:33,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And Homies Rollers on the DS.

755
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:40,077
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures that you can get out of those machines for 10 cents or 25 cents.

756
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:41,117
[SPEAKER_05]: My boss used to collect those.

757
00:50:46,008 --> 00:50:47,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's it.

758
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash Bros Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week.

759
00:50:52,694 --> 00:50:58,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance, but maybe there's a certain audience for that, I don't know.

760
00:50:58,539 --> 00:50:59,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you what.

761
00:51:00,721 --> 00:51:01,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, what?

762
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:07,486
[SPEAKER_01]: If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies... Oh no, here we go, here we go, okay, yes, yes.

763
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:10,449
[SPEAKER_01]: If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies, yes, what?

764
00:51:11,295 --> 00:51:14,316
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do the whole Tinkle thing and we'll burn Eye of Judgment.

765
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:15,416
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll need another game in there.

766
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:16,856
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, more of a chance.

767
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:19,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?

768
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

769
00:51:21,737 --> 00:51:22,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

770
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:28,678
[SPEAKER_02]: The makers of that game just thanked you for selling, like, you know, about 100 additional copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise.

771
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:29,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'll make it even more fair.

772
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:33,879
[SPEAKER_01]: The combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever... Whoa, whoa!

773
00:51:33,919 --> 00:51:37,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment now... Yes.

774
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:42,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell 100,000 copies.

775
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:44,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody mark the date and time of this.

776
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:48,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's almost exactly 7 o'clock here on Sunday evening, March 2nd.

777
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:50,250
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll never sell anything, okay?

778
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:50,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

779
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:51,070
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

780
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:53,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's something that's given the listeners.

781
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:57,134
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for the little meter some of the chatters made up.

782
00:51:57,554 --> 00:52:02,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that looks like a telethon thing, and it's like the road to one million copies.

783
00:52:02,877 --> 00:52:03,657
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll never happen.

784
00:52:03,697 --> 00:52:05,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it gives them something to add to that.

785
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:07,619
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll never, ever happen.

786
00:52:09,878 --> 00:52:20,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never ever sell Here's the thing, chatroom You gotta get him to keep adding games to it until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total

787
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:26,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that.

788
00:52:26,529 --> 00:52:28,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Gold Bandra says another one for the OLR wiki.

789
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:29,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to mention Housekeeping.

790
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:30,850
[SPEAKER_02]: This would have been good.

791
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,811
[SPEAKER_02]: They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio.

792
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:36,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can wiki stuff on it.

793
00:52:36,912 --> 00:52:40,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I guess... Well, we have an official Wikipedia article.

794
00:52:41,073 --> 00:52:44,214
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we have our own freaking entire wiki.

795
00:52:45,034 --> 00:52:51,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really... You'd think I wrote it or Loki wrote that article, but we've never...

796
00:52:52,842 --> 00:52:54,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Really worked on that.

797
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:56,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It was totally the fans that did that, so that was really cool.

798
00:52:57,606 --> 00:52:58,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even seen it.

799
00:52:59,648 --> 00:53:00,289
[SPEAKER_02]: On Wikipedia?

800
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:03,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I thought you meant on Wikipedia.

801
00:53:03,772 --> 00:53:05,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia.

802
00:53:05,673 --> 00:53:06,714
[SPEAKER_05]: A wiki set up for us.

803
00:53:06,734 --> 00:53:09,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki.

804
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,198
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was talking about.

805
00:53:11,238 --> 00:53:13,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out.

806
00:53:13,841 --> 00:53:16,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It's orangeloungeradio.wikia.com

807
00:53:19,605 --> 00:53:19,885
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 360 ARCADE

808
00:53:44,631 --> 00:53:45,772
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

809
00:54:01,229 --> 00:54:02,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

810
00:54:17,914 --> 00:54:20,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we're not the only ones that have to wait for big titles sometimes.

811
00:54:20,655 --> 00:54:21,935
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Japan had to wait for this one.

812
00:54:21,955 --> 00:54:22,935
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of surprised me.

813
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:25,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look to see if it's a price reduction or something like that.

814
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.

815
00:54:25,675 --> 00:54:26,376
[SPEAKER_02]: It's full price.

816
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So this must be the first time they're getting that.

817
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:30,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of surprised me.

818
00:54:30,876 --> 00:54:33,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin.

819
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes with a... Online, I think.

820
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:40,418
[SPEAKER_02]: But it comes with what's called a power-up kit.

821
00:54:41,138 --> 00:54:43,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not exactly sure what a power-up kit has in it.

822
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something they're...

823
00:54:46,277 --> 00:54:47,098
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't released two yet.

824
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:48,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games.

825
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:49,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps.

826
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,701
[SPEAKER_01]: They did the same thing with Devil Kings or whatever they call that over there.

827
00:54:54,362 --> 00:54:56,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes.

828
00:54:57,844 --> 00:54:58,344
[SPEAKER_03]: It's drugs.

829
00:54:59,045 --> 00:54:59,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

830
00:54:59,345 --> 00:55:01,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does look like another version of Nobunaga's Ambition.

831
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang, the last time I played this game was on the NES.

832
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:04,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And look how far it's come.

833
00:55:05,448 --> 00:55:06,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Civilization.

834
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Civ 1.

835
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I have such fond memories of that.

836
00:55:09,251 --> 00:55:14,814
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a Nobunaga's Ambition game that came out at the beginning of February for PlayStation 2.

837
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:18,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore.

838
00:55:18,132 --> 00:55:19,553
[SPEAKER_02]: They're too complicated for me.

839
00:55:19,793 --> 00:55:21,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not smart enough to play those games, I'll admit it.

840
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:24,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's just exactly what it boils down to.

841
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:26,116
[SPEAKER_02]: They're too much for me now.

842
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:26,776
[SPEAKER_02]: They get too complicated.

843
00:55:26,796 --> 00:55:29,797
[SPEAKER_01]: They need a Nobunaga's Ambition party game.

844
00:55:29,977 --> 00:55:34,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they need like, you know how they like dumbed down Madden for Wii owners?

845
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:35,160
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I need.

846
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a dumbed down version of Nobunaga's Ambition.

847
00:55:37,241 --> 00:55:38,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Swing the remote down to Conquer Japan.

848
00:55:39,562 --> 00:55:39,902
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

849
00:55:42,096 --> 00:55:43,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too bad they don't have achievement points.

850
00:55:44,158 --> 00:55:47,701
[SPEAKER_02]: And I accidentally closed out my list, so I'll tell you what.

851
00:55:47,741 --> 00:55:49,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we go to Europe and then we'll come back to Japan?

852
00:55:49,142 --> 00:55:49,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

853
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:50,623
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually makes me think.

854
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:53,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we ever get a current-gen release of Risk?

855
00:55:55,106 --> 00:55:55,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I can think of.

856
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,229
[SPEAKER_02]: But wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?

857
00:55:58,309 --> 00:56:00,651
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be cool if we had Risk and Axis and Allies.

858
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be cool?

859
00:56:01,432 --> 00:56:03,753
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be very cool.

860
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:04,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I love games like that.

861
00:56:05,054 --> 00:56:05,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

862
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the Japanese release dates back.

863
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:07,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

864
00:56:07,677 --> 00:56:08,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

865
00:56:08,577 --> 00:56:09,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe can wait a little longer.

866
00:56:09,758 --> 00:56:10,419
[SPEAKER_02]: They're used to it.

867
00:56:12,742 --> 00:56:13,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit what?

868
00:56:13,242 --> 00:56:14,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Below the bell.

869
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:14,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

870
00:56:15,003 --> 00:56:15,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Party foul.

871
00:56:15,744 --> 00:56:18,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear European listeners, please send Rob a smack in the head via email.

872
00:56:18,905 --> 00:56:19,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your cards and letters.

873
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:22,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

874
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,148
[SPEAKER_01]: They get, like, Mario Kart early.

875
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:24,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.

876
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:26,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, shut up.

877
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Go stuff yourself with a carpet.

878
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:33,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

879
00:56:33,413 --> 00:56:34,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Britain.

880
00:56:34,313 --> 00:56:35,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all of Europe.

881
00:56:35,834 --> 00:56:36,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I love France.

882
00:56:36,595 --> 00:56:37,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Spain.

883
00:56:37,215 --> 00:56:37,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them all.

884
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:38,436
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

885
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:40,597
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PlayStation 2...

886
00:56:41,906 --> 00:56:44,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well.

887
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:45,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?

888
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:55,010
[SPEAKER_02]: As if there wasn't enough pachinko in your life, Hisuu Pachinko Pachislot Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well.

889
00:56:55,290 --> 00:57:03,293
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of pachinko, because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that.

890
00:57:04,185 --> 00:57:12,733
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Nintendo DS, Bomberman gets a price cut, Dorimon, Nobita Ton Midori no Kyojinden DS comes out.

891
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:14,555
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, it's Dorimon on the DS.

892
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:44,465
[SPEAKER_02]: and lastly on the PSP and then I promise we can do the Europe dates Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable that is a combo kit of those games it's like an Ultimate Hits so there you have it and also Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits the Lenneth and what was the other one Slamera or whatever it was called they both move into the Greatest Hits Collection alright now that all of Britain hates me and Europe in general

893
00:57:45,652 --> 00:57:47,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to their release dates, shall we, Jamie?

894
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:48,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

895
00:57:49,013 --> 00:57:54,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, these are all on the 7th, and one of them pisses me off, but I have a certain bias against it.

896
00:57:55,634 --> 00:58:13,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Blackside Area 51 on PS3, Bully Scholarship Edition, Xbox 360 and Wii, Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed on Wii, Dynasty Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Jack Kane on PC,

897
00:58:14,768 --> 00:58:29,378
[SPEAKER_05]: MX vs. ATV Untamed on a bunch of crap, Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one, The Destiny of Zorro on Wii, Victorious Boxers on Wii, and the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K, Dawn of War.

898
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:31,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?

899
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Victorious.

900
00:58:32,841 --> 00:58:33,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Victorious.

901
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:35,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you said Victorious.

902
00:58:35,382 --> 00:58:37,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, like, is that like Victorious Closet for Men?

903
00:58:38,124 --> 00:58:38,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, now they're expanding?

904
00:58:38,925 --> 00:58:40,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls.

905
00:58:40,586 --> 00:58:41,787
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean Victorious Secret?

906
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:43,748
[SPEAKER_02]: She has a penis?

907
00:58:44,704 --> 00:58:46,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you said Victoria's Closet.

908
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:08,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Warhammer 40k.

909
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:08,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

910
00:59:22,921 --> 00:59:23,682
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

911
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:53,791
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all he ever did, so yeah, I broke up with him to play with, you know, to hang out with some guy that played Rift.

912
00:59:54,611 --> 01:00:04,573
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun, though, running over those little figurines with a toy train, because, you know, if you're going to build your own landscape, you might as well already have a train set and landscape built already for that.

913
01:00:05,694 --> 01:00:11,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can understand having a project, that's one thing, but when your entire life is your project, that's a little something else.

914
01:00:11,455 --> 01:00:12,295
[SPEAKER_05]: That and he didn't have a job.

915
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:12,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

916
01:00:13,467 --> 01:00:20,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking about building little figurines, Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spin-offs for different games, including Indiana Jones and Star Wars.

917
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:25,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo.

918
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:35,385
[SPEAKER_01]: As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue, but they have screenshots to prove that it's real, you know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts, but...

919
01:00:36,806 --> 01:00:47,053
[SPEAKER_02]: The minute I saw a headline that said April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was, I was like, oh, haha, funny April Fool's joke.

920
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:47,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate April Fool's.

921
01:00:48,154 --> 01:00:50,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate April Fool's.

922
01:00:50,415 --> 01:00:51,956
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be cool if it were real.

923
01:00:52,176 --> 01:00:54,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it is, and I don't think you would try it.

924
01:00:54,438 --> 01:00:54,878
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.

925
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:55,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

926
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,021
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine, you know.

927
01:00:59,992 --> 01:01:03,213
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course it's their exclusive they say and stuff like that.

928
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:10,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, if this wasn't a real exclusive, 1up.com would be whoring the shit out of this right now, okay?

929
01:01:10,195 --> 01:01:15,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they like to tease their exclusives, so whatever.

930
01:01:16,096 --> 01:01:18,717
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need any more Halo or Lego Halo.

931
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:20,990
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

932
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:46,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

933
01:02:14,839 --> 01:02:16,200
[SPEAKER_02]: and turn back into game data.

934
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,922
[SPEAKER_02]: What a weird concept.

935
01:02:18,062 --> 01:02:18,983
[SPEAKER_03]: It's treasure.

936
01:02:19,163 --> 01:02:25,609
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing you can do with this is you can put them in MP3 format or whatever and spread them out on the internet so people can download them that way.

937
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:27,050
[SPEAKER_05]: It's treasure.

938
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:34,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat, I'll admit, but when I first read this, I'm like, this is the weirdest thing I've ever heard.

939
01:02:34,653 --> 01:02:36,073
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

940
01:03:01,898 --> 01:03:02,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

941
01:03:18,289 --> 01:03:40,135
[SPEAKER_02]: and put it in a regular CD player and if you know what I'm talking about you're old school because we did this in junior high we would take a copy of Encarta and put it in a regular CD player and it makes the most hideous noise and what you do is it was like the dumbass joke you would play is that you would turn the radio thing up full blast close the door and run ah yes

942
01:03:41,522 --> 01:03:52,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remember putting them in, especially they'd also do it on PC Engine Duo desks who say, this is a game disc, do not listen to this or your speakers will die.

943
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,010
[SPEAKER_05]: That type of thing.

944
01:03:56,705 --> 01:03:57,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting feature.

945
01:03:58,546 --> 01:04:07,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought to go run out and buy or even really check out just because there's too many other games on the table, right?

946
01:04:07,953 --> 01:04:11,375
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I'm kind of like, I might have to look at this game just for this feature.

947
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you in one word why I'm getting this game.

948
01:04:14,337 --> 01:04:14,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

949
01:04:14,777 --> 01:04:15,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Treasure!

950
01:04:16,738 --> 01:04:17,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have known.

951
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:18,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Treasure!

952
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,861
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason why I'm still looking for Chameleon Twist.

953
01:04:21,742 --> 01:04:23,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, let's move on.

954
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:25,324
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to say until the game comes out.

955
01:04:26,027 --> 01:04:46,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know that quite a number of our listeners are into rock band, so something that everyone should be happy about is that there is a Grateful Dead pack coming out for a rock band that will have China Cat Sunflower, Casey Jones, Sugar Magnolia, Truckin', Franklin's Tower, and I Need a Miracle.

956
01:04:47,661 --> 01:04:51,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that's pretty cool, because Grateful Dead is pretty cool.

957
01:04:52,102 --> 01:04:57,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit, because that would be the full dead experience right there.

958
01:04:57,366 --> 01:04:57,886
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

959
01:04:58,786 --> 01:04:59,647
[SPEAKER_01]: You laugh about that.

960
01:05:00,027 --> 01:05:02,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, okay, one of my customers... Oh, no.

961
01:05:02,749 --> 01:05:03,350
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.

962
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:04,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Not about the weed thing.

963
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:13,496
[SPEAKER_01]: No, one of my customers actually saw the kit set up at one of the GameStops, I guess, in Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from.

964
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:14,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

965
01:05:17,062 --> 01:05:17,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

966
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,508
[SPEAKER_01]: and they react to the sound that you do.

967
01:05:30,528 --> 01:05:33,990
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could do the show and it would react to our speaking and stuff.

968
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:35,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Just what we need.

969
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:36,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, DarkSakura.

970
01:05:36,772 --> 01:05:38,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a little bit more to this story.

971
01:05:38,933 --> 01:05:50,039
[SPEAKER_05]: For people who are not so rock band oriented and are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented, actually No Doubt's having some releases on there, which No Doubt, cool.

972
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:52,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Gwen Stefani's solo, bad, because she sucks.

973
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:55,122
[SPEAKER_05]: That and she's got mental problems, but...

974
01:05:55,638 --> 01:05:56,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

975
01:05:56,219 --> 01:05:57,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, tell us what you really think.

976
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,541
[SPEAKER_02]: What songs are coming out from No Doubt, do we know?

977
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:02,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't Speak, Excuse Me, Mister, and Sunday Morning.

978
01:06:03,644 --> 01:06:04,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend.

979
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:06,567
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the song I love.

980
01:06:06,747 --> 01:06:09,529
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no Just a Girl, no Spiderwebs.

981
01:06:09,709 --> 01:06:12,651
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list, so I'm happy.

982
01:06:13,312 --> 01:06:13,872
[SPEAKER_02]: What song is that?

983
01:06:14,072 --> 01:06:14,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't Speak.

984
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:15,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't Speak.

985
01:06:15,313 --> 01:06:18,296
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's hear some clips of these songs that are coming to Rock Band very soon.

986
01:06:18,336 --> 01:06:19,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a clip of the Grateful Dead.

987
01:06:19,937 --> 01:06:21,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you got them, smoke them.

988
01:06:22,018 --> 01:06:22,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding, that's bad.

989
01:06:39,322 --> 01:06:42,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in Rock Band.

990
01:06:42,903 --> 01:06:52,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have coming to, not coming to Grateful Dead, coming to Guitar Hero 3, we have No Doubt.

991
01:06:52,546 --> 01:06:57,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak, so let's play one of the more lesser known songs, which would be Sunday Morning.

992
01:07:17,558 --> 01:07:21,400
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I'm glad I breathed some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band in general.

993
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:24,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Band, the wheels keep on turning with that game.

994
01:07:26,003 --> 01:07:27,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Proud Mary keep on burning?

995
01:07:27,123 --> 01:07:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

996
01:07:28,184 --> 01:07:28,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

997
01:07:28,664 --> 01:07:29,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe someday.

998
01:07:29,965 --> 01:07:30,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

999
01:07:30,905 --> 01:07:35,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to be outdone, from the studio that brings you Hannah Montana...

1000
01:07:37,831 --> 01:07:40,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Disney has announced a brand new game for the Wii.

1001
01:07:40,594 --> 01:07:42,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert.

1002
01:07:42,537 --> 01:07:43,017
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

1003
01:07:43,738 --> 01:07:45,240
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Ultimate Band.

1004
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,062
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, fuck this rock band shit.

1005
01:07:47,262 --> 01:07:48,904
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Ultimate Band.

1006
01:07:49,545 --> 01:07:51,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS.

1007
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:56,534
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing, though, that you will be happy to know, and maybe this might be...

1008
01:07:57,501 --> 01:07:59,361
[SPEAKER_01]: You have one, two, zero, or both You know what?

1009
01:08:24,746 --> 01:08:27,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna say something pretty daring here.

1010
01:08:27,296 --> 01:08:28,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this actually isn't a bad idea.

1011
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:31,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Because think about who this game is aimed at.

1012
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:38,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's aimed at kids, and parents don't want to spend all this freaking money on all these peripherals that their kids are going to destroy.

1013
01:08:38,595 --> 01:08:39,175
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what?

1014
01:08:39,235 --> 01:08:47,820
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a Wii, why not come out with a game that's very similar to Rock Band, but you don't have to buy all this extra shit for?

1015
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:50,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I'm not going to like it.

1016
01:08:50,061 --> 01:08:52,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Jamie, Matt, they're not going to like it.

1017
01:08:52,123 --> 01:08:53,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really made for us.

1018
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:54,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a kid's game.

1019
01:08:54,484 --> 01:08:58,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try it, but I don't think I'd buy this game, but I'll try it.

1020
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:15,547
[SPEAKER_01]: It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays and the DS version will have that brand new D-Gamer online social network which is sounding pretty awesome and I really kind of want to check it out but that means I have to buy a Disney DS game and I don't know.

1021
01:09:16,047 --> 01:09:20,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft in chat says Sky speaks the truth and GS68 says Sky is right.

1022
01:09:20,569 --> 01:09:21,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Ego plus plus.

1023
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:26,331
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room actually just reminded me of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming week.

1024
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:26,772
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

1025
01:09:27,072 --> 01:09:27,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I bought Parappa.

1026
01:09:29,788 --> 01:09:32,589
[SPEAKER_05]: for $15 out of Hollywood going out of business.

1027
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:35,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1028
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:39,893
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT says, Sky, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the Flames will disagree.

1029
01:09:40,193 --> 01:09:41,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, he's a freak.

1030
01:09:42,254 --> 01:09:43,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, did I just call a 7-year-old a freak?

1031
01:09:44,195 --> 01:09:44,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1032
01:09:44,775 --> 01:09:45,216
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

1033
01:09:45,236 --> 01:09:45,756
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a freak.

1034
01:09:47,397 --> 01:09:51,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Uni in chat says, Kids already nom-nommed the hell out of the Wii Remote.

1035
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:55,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii Remote and hid it under the couch.

1036
01:09:57,737 --> 01:10:01,859
[SPEAKER_02]: If your seven-year-old nom-noms the Wii Remote and hides it under the couch, you've got issues.

1037
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:03,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that phrase.

1038
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:03,660
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.

1039
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,441
[SPEAKER_02]: What, nom-nom?

1040
01:10:04,581 --> 01:10:05,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Nom-nom.

1041
01:10:07,122 --> 01:10:07,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you hear?

1042
01:10:07,922 --> 01:10:09,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is Caturday now.

1043
01:10:09,263 --> 01:10:09,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.

1044
01:10:10,924 --> 01:10:11,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Low-cat speak.

1045
01:10:11,944 --> 01:10:12,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Crunky Boy Jr.

1046
01:10:13,285 --> 01:10:16,487
[SPEAKER_02]: tries to put out a zinger here saying, You mean we save money on Wii peripherals?

1047
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:17,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Ba-dum-bum.

1048
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:18,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

1049
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:18,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the...

1050
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,942
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really have real Wii peripherals.

1051
01:10:22,002 --> 01:10:26,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, after all, there's like, what, the classic controller and the nunchuck?

1052
01:10:26,085 --> 01:10:27,186
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii?

1053
01:10:27,226 --> 01:10:28,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is plastic shit.

1054
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:33,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well...

1055
01:10:34,381 --> 01:10:34,661
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1056
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how it worked.

1057
01:10:55,339 --> 01:10:57,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Jonathan Colton was up on stage with his band.

1058
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,920
[SPEAKER_02]: They were playing Still Alive, but in rock band.

1059
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, he didn't get 100% on vocals, which is ironically hilarious.

1060
01:11:05,021 --> 01:11:05,661
[SPEAKER_02]: They finish.

1061
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,462
[SPEAKER_02]: The crowd is cheering.

1062
01:11:08,282 --> 01:11:18,684
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens is that this guy from the crowd gets up on stage, walks over to the 360, pulls out a memory card, which I don't know who carries 360 memory cards with them on the go.

1063
01:11:18,944 --> 01:11:22,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, I used to carry a PlayStation memory card when I'd go to the arcade and stuff.

1064
01:11:22,765 --> 01:11:23,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Because

1065
01:11:24,746 --> 01:11:30,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of any reason why you would put a 360 card in your pocket everywhere you go.

1066
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,471
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever, it's Game Developers Conference, whatever.

1067
01:11:32,851 --> 01:11:40,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So he pulls out this memory card, he puts it in, messes around, and then finally, one of the Harmonix guys walks over and says, what's going on?

1068
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:42,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy says, I'm just grabbing Still Alive.

1069
01:11:42,338 --> 01:11:43,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone needs to be able to play this.

1070
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:46,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the developer took it back and

1071
01:11:47,254 --> 01:11:49,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, deleted the thing off the card and, you know, all is well.

1072
01:11:50,358 --> 01:11:55,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway, because it's probably a dev 360, and I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild.

1073
01:11:55,804 --> 01:12:01,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it wouldn't have worked anyways because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management, which we'll get into later, but...

1074
01:12:02,555 --> 01:12:04,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently the guy actually wrote about it.

1075
01:12:04,636 --> 01:12:13,824
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason I'm not giving this idiot of the week award or stupid guy of the week or whatever we're calling it here award is because apparently the guy wrote about it in his live journal.

1076
01:12:13,884 --> 01:12:14,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.

1077
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:17,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate.

1078
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:19,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be fanfic or some shit.

1079
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:20,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1080
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:21,451
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's legit.

1081
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:23,733
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check it out on his live journal.

1082
01:12:23,793 --> 01:12:27,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's algoromancy.livejournal.com.

1083
01:12:27,696 --> 01:12:28,697
[SPEAKER_02]: That's A-L-G-R-O-M-A-N-C-Y.

1084
01:12:29,504 --> 01:12:35,308
[SPEAKER_02]: O-R-I-T-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com and he writes in this entry on February 21st, 2008.

1085
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:39,330
[SPEAKER_02]: He writes his side of the story and his thing, he puts a disclaimer at the end.

1086
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:40,591
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, don't try this at home.

1087
01:12:40,871 --> 01:12:50,176
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason I did because I am an acquaintance of Alex who works at Harmonix as well as good friends with several Harmonix folks and game industry friends give each other free swag all the time.

1088
01:12:50,236 --> 01:12:53,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material is theft.

1089
01:12:54,599 --> 01:12:54,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1090
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:57,341
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?

1091
01:12:57,621 --> 01:12:57,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1092
01:12:58,365 --> 01:12:58,685
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

1093
01:13:26,721 --> 01:13:29,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we wrap, are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in studio?

1094
01:13:29,282 --> 01:13:29,522
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1095
01:13:30,142 --> 01:13:31,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear our idea?

1096
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:33,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if this is the week you were gone, because February was all fucked up.

1097
01:13:34,264 --> 01:13:45,469
[SPEAKER_02]: But were you here the week we had the idea that when it comes out, we'll get Mo back, and she'll be our vocalist, and we'll get Matt to play drums, you can play guitar, you and I can work out the guitar somehow, and we'll have an OLR band, and we'll do our rendition.

1098
01:13:45,489 --> 01:13:46,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mentioned last week.

1099
01:13:46,169 --> 01:13:46,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it last week?

1100
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:47,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

1101
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:49,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting old, and the weeks blend together.

1102
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:50,131
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay, Rob.

1103
01:13:50,151 --> 01:13:50,391
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1104
01:13:51,031 --> 01:13:51,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1105
01:13:52,072 --> 01:13:54,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still bringing you your birthday present.

1106
01:13:54,813 --> 01:13:55,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

1107
01:13:56,533 --> 01:14:01,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, speaking of getting old, the older we get, the more we reminisce about the classic games.

1108
01:14:01,495 --> 01:14:05,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we like to pay tribute to the classic game of the week every week.

1109
01:14:06,217 --> 01:14:12,240
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura likes to respect her elders in the gaming world by paying tribute to an old classic game.

1110
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:19,503
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's dust off a dusty game and see what DarkSakura has picked for this week's classic game of the week.

1111
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:19,883
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

1112
01:14:20,478 --> 01:14:37,631
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually one of my favorite arcade games ever, and I have it on Saturn, is Cyber Troopers Virtual On, which is a 3D robot fighting game done from a behind-the-view of your own character who you're playing.

1113
01:14:38,211 --> 01:14:38,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a listen.

1114
01:14:49,770 --> 01:15:04,985
[SPEAKER_05]: and almost every other sample of it online was horrible so moving forward um you basically play as a virturoid um you know a giant robot controlled by a person which is actually pretty funny because um

1115
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:10,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Their little insert things where the pilots go in the back of the Moon for Saturn.

1116
01:15:10,497 --> 01:15:16,890
[SPEAKER_05]: In the sequel, Virtuon, Oretario Tangram was a Dreamcast, which I have that game too, and it's awesome.

1117
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:25,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but you would play as a number of them with different specialties, like you have, um, the Temjin, which is the, the balanced one.

1118
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:35,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you have the Raiden, which is a heavy battle one, really strong and, you know, heavily, uh, armed.

1119
01:15:35,253 --> 01:15:42,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you have, uh, the Ampharm, which is, uh, supposed to be, I think, one of the, uh, fast ones.

1120
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it uses a combo weapon.

1121
01:15:44,861 --> 01:15:47,183
[SPEAKER_05]: You have, uh, Belgor, which is, um,

1122
01:15:48,551 --> 01:16:04,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Abyssal Launcher, the Dorcus, which is another pretty heavy one, the Viper II, the Fast Balbo, and my favorite, which is the Feiyen, which is like the cute little Loki Mecha, which is really fast and nice.

1123
01:16:04,755 --> 01:16:12,117
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the Z-Grat, and then you have the Jaguarati, which is, as far as I remember, I think it was one of the heavy ones.

1124
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:15,858
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the arcade, you had a two-person set-up,

1125
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had a dividing wall in between so you were like in the cockpit.

1126
01:16:20,482 --> 01:16:24,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And it used two sticks to control it.

1127
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:27,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And on Saturn they did release the twin sticks.

1128
01:16:28,268 --> 01:16:31,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually don't have them which makes me very upset because I had a chance to get them.

1129
01:16:33,011 --> 01:16:37,755
[SPEAKER_05]: They did do Oratario Tangram that was on the Dreamcast.

1130
01:16:37,775 --> 01:16:39,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually do have the twin sticks for that.

1131
01:16:39,656 --> 01:16:41,197
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, you remember your ex-roommate?

1132
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:42,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1133
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:43,839
[SPEAKER_05]: We beat him getting them.

1134
01:16:45,965 --> 01:16:46,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1135
01:16:46,905 --> 01:16:49,647
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento.

1136
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:50,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1137
01:16:50,407 --> 01:16:51,968
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not talking about the one I live with.

1138
01:16:52,328 --> 01:16:53,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're talking about that.

1139
01:16:53,248 --> 01:16:54,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That roommate.

1140
01:16:54,129 --> 01:16:54,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1141
01:16:54,649 --> 01:16:57,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were the days, man.

1142
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:57,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the days.

1143
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:04,513
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy who sold it to us ended up being my husband, ended up being, I do believe, Moe's manager.

1144
01:17:08,975 --> 01:17:12,837
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know, we're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town.

1145
01:17:14,022 --> 01:17:19,627
[SPEAKER_05]: But at any rate, we came in, we saw the twin sticks for 45 bucks, which is astounding at that time.

1146
01:17:20,248 --> 01:17:21,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, we want to buy these right now.

1147
01:17:21,849 --> 01:17:22,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, okay.

1148
01:17:23,111 --> 01:17:28,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a person who's a, as far as I knew, his nickname came from this game.

1149
01:17:31,697 --> 01:17:33,578
[SPEAKER_05]: came in and we beat them by like 10 minutes.

1150
01:17:34,038 --> 01:17:35,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are also other versions.

1151
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:45,668
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Cybertroopers Virtual on Force that was only in Japanese arcades in 2001 and Virtual on Mars, which was the PS2 release.

1152
01:17:46,368 --> 01:17:49,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's also an audio drama for it, which is kind of funny.

1153
01:17:51,952 --> 01:17:56,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was a musical one, which was the Feiyan Robot Singing Festival.

1154
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:01,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have a Feiyan garage kit that I still have yet to put together that I bought like six years ago.

1155
01:18:02,624 --> 01:18:02,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1156
01:18:03,024 --> 01:18:04,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Virtual On's like tops.

1157
01:18:06,027 --> 01:18:06,407
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1158
01:18:07,008 --> 01:18:07,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's going to do it.

1159
01:18:07,989 --> 01:18:10,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Your classic game of the week, Virtual On.

1160
01:18:11,274 --> 01:18:11,574
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1161
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:33,966
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1162
01:18:57,376 --> 01:18:59,299
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the guy that created Pong up to now?

1163
01:18:59,379 --> 01:19:00,200
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be surprised.

1164
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:05,186
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1165
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:16,937
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1166
01:19:38,363 --> 01:20:04,400
[SPEAKER_02]: and as we were taping that right at the very end we were trying to unjumble some of the cords back here and the power cord to the computer got detached and the whole damn thing shut off and although Audition keeps a temporary file on hand when I went in to recover the file I made a mistake and ended up deleting the damn files I was trying to make a backup copy of it and I've tried everything I can't get there's it's not in the recycle bin is pick the chat room's brain on it

1167
01:20:04,873 --> 01:20:05,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone.

1168
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:06,414
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't coming back.

1169
01:20:06,814 --> 01:20:07,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very sorry.

1170
01:20:08,255 --> 01:20:10,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin, I was thinking March wouldn't be as broken as February.

1171
01:20:11,578 --> 01:20:17,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I guess one silver lining to this is that if you do want to hear Part B, it is still archived on the Justin TV channel.

1172
01:20:17,762 --> 01:20:20,023
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go to justin.tv slash orange launch radio.

1173
01:20:20,344 --> 01:20:23,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe some of our listeners are trying to make a highlight of the show right now.

1174
01:20:23,386 --> 01:20:28,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it becomes this big lost archive of the show.

1175
01:20:28,069 --> 01:20:29,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a collector's item of sorts.

1176
01:20:30,263 --> 01:20:32,285
[SPEAKER_02]: We will try to get an audio rip of that.

1177
01:20:59,898 --> 01:21:04,300
[SPEAKER_02]: and a little sad, especially off of a few broken weeks in a row.

1178
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But what can you do?

1179
01:21:05,681 --> 01:21:06,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Life goes on.

1180
01:21:06,782 --> 01:21:08,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody has a wonderful week.

1181
01:21:08,303 --> 01:21:08,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy gaming.

1182
01:21:09,363 --> 01:21:13,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week with all new power chords in studio.

1183
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:14,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.
