00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Sky and Loco

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, March 2, 2008

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 gets dated and bundled

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Mario Kart Wii also gets a date and online texting

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And could the game Road Rash be making a comeback?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hi

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
How are you Miss DarkSakura?

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm well

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
You're well, that's good

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes, I'm well

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
You're well, alright

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'll explain why momentarily

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Okay

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
But first I have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Hello

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Good

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Alright

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Sorry I don't have anything extra for you tonight, but you know, that's what happens

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I gotta say though, very interesting troubleshooting before the show

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
We were kind of joking last week on the show that February is the month of Broken here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
And unfortunately it looked like March was going to turn out the same way

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Because for whatever reason we have a wireless network that sits inside the house here where we tape

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And for whatever reason just last week when we were doing the short show

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
It suddenly decided that the strength is not going to be as powerful anymore

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
And the Justin TV cam would not see, that runs off an iBook that would no longer see the WiFi network

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
And then tonight Jamie's computer decided it wasn't going to see the network either

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
So I have no idea what's going on with the box

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
But very impressed with the technical skills behind

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
What did we do? We turned your computer

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
We turned my computer into a gateway

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
So it's using my wireless internet connection

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
But I have an ethernet cable and you ran it to the old router

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
And then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
So it's bouncing wireless to the router to my laptop, wireless to the other router

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
So right now

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
We'll do a piggybacking

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam which is back this week

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Hi guys

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Is going through this router

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
That goes through Loki's computer

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
That goes through the router in the house which goes to Comcast

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
And the internet

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Amazing

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
This is uber geek tech talk here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's like a wireless orgy

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Alright

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I have something for Jamie

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And it's actually her birthday present

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
And it's like six weeks early

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
What?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Yes I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Because it's something you have to prepare for

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Okay

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
So I'm going to give this to you

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Plus I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
So I think this is a good time for me to give this to you

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Okay

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
So here you go

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Open it up and see what they're tickets to

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Okay

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Alright and hopefully she likes it, I hope

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Wow I know they heard this squeak on Justin TV

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yay

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Tell the listeners what I got you

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Rob got me a ticket to see Margaret Cho

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Now in here locally

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Now I'd also like to point out, look at where the seats are

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Eee

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
That's like close

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
That's third row

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Probably look up her nose

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Third row tickets

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
So quite excited

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yay

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh my god where is this?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Davis

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Really?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
So it's not that far at all

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Cool

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
There we have it

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
So mark that date on your calendar

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
It's May something something

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm doing that right now

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Alright

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
There you go

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
So I thought that would help after a poopy week

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So like I knew I had to tell you

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Or get tickets independently somehow

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I didn't even know

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I didn't either, I got an email about it

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
So there you go

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
And I know Jamie loves some Margaret Cho and I do too

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
She's pretty funny

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Hopefully she's not quite so political

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
But you know

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
She's still somebody I like

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes me and you

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Cool

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Alright

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
There should be two there

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I was like

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Okay

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I thought so because I was like

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Why

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Okay

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
No you have to take me I'm sorry

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Of course

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Of course

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
No this is so cool

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Thank you Rob

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Alright you're welcome

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Now we can get to talking about video games yes?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Alright

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
So we're done with Tech Talk

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
We're done with Oprah

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Now let's talk

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's talk video games

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
How was your gaming week

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Dark Sakura?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
My gaming week was

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Well it was interesting

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I picked it up

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And then I had other stuff to do

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Because I watched Tron earlier in the week

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I was like

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I love Tron I want to play Kingdom Hearts

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Because of the whole Space Paranoids level

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
And there was a lot of burnout

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
And I watched Dan play a lot of burnout

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
And I played a lot of Ragnarok

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
That was it

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Alright

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Well Loki how was your gaming week?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
My gaming week was okay

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I played

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I actually picked up Pop Tippon

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
And I've been playing quite a bit of that

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
In fact that's what I was playing before the show

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
It's fun

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's different

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I like it

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I don't know

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
It's very easy to play

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
But I guess

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
It takes some time to build up your armies and stuff

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Then I played

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And I actually purchased N Plus

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
On Xbox Live Arcade

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
And that game is just as fun as the original N

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
So thoroughly enjoying that

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
And

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Because we were having this party

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
We have at the end of every month for our work

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And this one happened to be leap year themed

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And so they wanted Frogger

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
And they used my system to play Frogger

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
So I got to play some of that

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Because no one else was touching it

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And then

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
So that's actually pretty cool

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I finally got to the point in the game

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Where one of the characters dies

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Not necessarily a main character

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
But I was just very surprised

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
On how everyone makes that argument

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Of video games being art and stuff

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Well

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Shit I think there's a perfect example right there

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Of how powerful they can make the story

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And it was pretty cool

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
So

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I'm about 11 hours into it now

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Still on the first disc though

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And just taking my time through that

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Pretty much that's it I guess

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Other than the usual Saints Row

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
But

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
No one wants to hear about that

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
For the five billionth time?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Well let's see

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
In my gaming week I also played Lost Odyssey

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And I had much the same experience as you did

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I got to the second disc

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Which means you kind of go through

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Some big plot twists in the first event

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Or first disc let's put it that way

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
And I'm amazed by the game

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flak

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
As it has been

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Although you know I do understand

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Some of the little complaints about the game

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And even one of them I find to be kind of annoying

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And that is lack of save points

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
One of the things that has been bugging me

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Is that sometimes I'll be forced to sit there for an hour

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
While the next part of the game loads

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Or whatever

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I mean it just takes forever

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
It's crazy

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
To get to the next save point

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
While you watch through all these cut scenes

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I mean it's not like it's bad

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
It's not like you're bored or anything

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Or you're just getting antsy

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Because there's lots to do

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
But sometimes I only want to play in little 30 minute chunks

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It auto saves too for some things

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Some things

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
There's checkpoints I guess

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
But not a lot

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I haven't had that problem with save points

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
What do you think about the difficulty of the game?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It's not that difficult

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Some of the boss battles were surprisingly tough

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
If you grind some of the way through there

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Because a lot of this game seems like it's very quick

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
There's certain areas in the game

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Where there's like two or three sections of the map

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
And then that's it

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
And then you're on to the next section of the world

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Or whatever

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
It's very small

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
But

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I don't know it wasn't that difficult

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
You just grind a little bit

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And get your characters leveled up

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And it's pretty easy

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Also I have the preorder bonus

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
So I have an item that gives me

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
A level 2 guard or whatever

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
So I can block most of the shots

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And it does zero damage to me

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Nice I don't have that

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
That was something you got for preorder huh?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Hopefully they release that as a download thing later

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It will probably come later on

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Let's go over to the chatroom

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
The chatroom has their own comments

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
It only sucks when you die an hour without a save

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Kind of true but there's also some things

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Where you go through cutscene cutscene cutscene

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And then you have to fight a big boss battle

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I mean I know you can skip cutscenes

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
But even then sometimes you have to sit there

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Because some of the cutscenes are rendered with the game engine

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
So you have to kind of sit there

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And press A A A A A

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You can also pause it

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And hit the back button

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
For the cutscenes but what about the ones where they're actually talking to each other

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
With the dialogue boxes

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
You have to A A A

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I don't know

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It doesn't matter

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It's honestly just a tiny little blemish

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
In what is otherwise a magnificent game

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
That deserves to be getting more attention than it is

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
As far as other games I've been playing this week

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I'm playing Smash Brothers Brawl

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Because I was

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Loki was kind enough to loan me his Japanese copy

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And the Wii to play it on

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
So I was checking that out a little bit this week

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Didn't understand what I was doing but I was having fun

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Playing just the massive

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Free for all mode

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So that was pretty cool

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Obviously last week I was sick

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
On the show and I'm happy to report I'm better

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I did have a sinus infection

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
So I had to go to a doctor and antibiotics and blah blah blah

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
He lent me that as kind of like a get better soon type thing

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Which was very nice

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
He said I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I didn't actually hook that thing up till like Friday

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
That's exactly why I loaded tickets

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
This is exactly what I'm doing

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I'm not playing Smash Brothers

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Well I mean even before Smash Brothers Brawl

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I never played Melee very much

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Maybe once at a friend's house

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
The first Smash Brothers Brawl I didn't even touch

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't know

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It's not really my type of game

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
It's fun

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But you know

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I may pick up the US one

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Gerardimo in chat says

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Rob do you think Brawl lives up to the hype even if it's not in English?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Kind of

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It's hard to tell

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I don't feel right giving a fair review on a Japanese game

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
When I don't understand how to get into some of the modes

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And look at the extra stuff

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
It does

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Lowkey has no problem answering that

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
The parts I've seen so far

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Like Smash Brothers Melee 1.5

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
A little bit

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Because it's like the same kind of engine

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
The same stuff with just some new characters

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But I realize that's not being totally fair

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
In saying that because I haven't looked at everything outside

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Of just the brawling

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But it does seem like there's a lot of the stuff they just copied

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Right on over from the GameCube version

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So very interesting

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Frisbee says

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Halo 3 feels like Halo 2.5

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It's a little bit that

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
It's a little bit that

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
But that's what it is

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So that was my gaming week

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So if that's everybody's gaming week

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Then we will move on to talking about some news

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
But for some housekeeping

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Of which we have nothing special of note

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
What's that?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
What's that?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
The award contesting that's going on through all games

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
That's like three months old

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I can't believe you just saw that

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I did just see that

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Hey I don't read

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I unfortunately don't read their website

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Or their forums

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
You're just too busy

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Doing other things

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I will give it a mention on air

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I don't even know if it's still going on

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I think it's kind of funny that Loki took so long to find it

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I posted a link on the forums

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Let me see

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
December 27th

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I didn't even notice it

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
All games

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Which our show runs on

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
We syndicate on their network

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
They play us Monday nights

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And then Tuesday mornings

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
At 9am

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
No because they do their regular

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
All games show at 10 now

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
But I know our show is syndicated on their network

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Mondays and Tuesdays supposedly

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
As a best affiliate podcast

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And it's all going on in their forums

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
The voting

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I would think it's already over

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Three months ago

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
But then again the topics are still up

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It's not closed

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So who knows, maybe it's an ongoing thing

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
From yesterday to today

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
They've put the votes as anonymous

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
So you can't see

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
What each podcast has

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Yesterday it didn't have it that way

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And Tigerclaw says Sky they still haven't announced the winners

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
So I guess it is ongoing

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
For three months now

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And Tigerclaw I know listens to all games

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Like every other day

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I don't know

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I voted for us

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Well I appreciate the support

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I guess for yourself

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
But he bought a knife judgment

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And I can't support that kind of behavior

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
That's most unfortunate

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
He also dropped out of the race

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
As of like yesterday

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Didn't want to play that game huh

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Alright well if you want to throw us a vote

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It's over on forums.allgames.com

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I will plug the other stuff I know we always got

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
We have our live general community at Orange Lounge

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And our Facebook is the O.L.R.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Be sure to look us up on our social networking sites

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Meet other O.L.R. listeners

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Look at our posts and clips of the show

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
We have on some of those places like MySpace

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Tons of fun

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Alright let's get into the gaming news. Loki take it away

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Okay so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
From Destination and Playstation

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
It's the retail only

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Conference thing or whatever

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I couldn't go but other people from my company did

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Bastards

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
And of course

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Some of the news that leaked out

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date finally

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
It's officially coming to the U.S.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
On June 12th

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And that of course

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Not only was leaked out but confirmed

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
By Konami

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And they also said that if you reserve your copy

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Of Metal Gear Solid 4 starting in April

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
2008

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
You get Metal Gear Saga 2.0

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
A DVD to catch you up on all the

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Stuff that's going on in the series

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
As well as a

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Data code for

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Metal Gear Online

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And then to coincide

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
With that and this

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't know if this is going to be the official

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
You know remember because the 80 gig

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Skew for the PS3 was being phased out

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Well there's a new 80 gig Skew now

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Same price but you get

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Controller all for $4.99

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Which is not a bad deal at all if you don't have

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
A PS3 because I know a lot of people

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Would be buying a PS3 for that

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And it's nice that they're actually throwing in

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
The DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Separately

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
No word on when that's coming out but it's

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Supposed to come out around the same time as

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 obviously

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
So June 12th and on

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I guess

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Alright

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Well moving on to

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Other gaming news although it still

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Actually

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Let me back up for just a minute

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
How important

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Is this news to PlayStation

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Fans you think?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I think it's very important

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
The year old MotorStorm

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
They needed to update that bundle

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Anyways because

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Shit that game is old now

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
To throw in there especially now that

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
The DualShock 3 controllers

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Probably not the 40 gig for right now

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Because there's supposedly

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
The one right now doesn't have it

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And I don't know if they're going to announce a new one

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Anytime soon

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's important

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I think this game is actually one of the first

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Major games for the PS3

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
That you can only get on the PS3

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
And you know that's

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
A little bit of fuel to Sony's Fire

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Although this is the first of hopefully many

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
It hopefully does very well

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Let's say

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 does not sell

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
All that I mean let's say

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Obviously the game is going to sell fine

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
At least mediocre

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
But let's say the game does not sell super duper well

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And doesn't move all these new bundles

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Is that going to be really bad for Sony

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Or will they get more chances?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
They may have more chances but a lot of the stuff

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
That they're counting on is like way later on

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Killzone 2 will be another one that moves systems

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Resistance Fall of Man 2

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Maybe MotorStorm 2

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And then

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Final Fantasy 13 that's so far off

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
That I wouldn't even

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Consider that anything to wait for

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Right now for the PS3

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
If you're going to wait that long you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
But

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
At the same time

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I don't know

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
It should do very well

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
But once again you know they're also hoping

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Like Blu-Ray is going to sell these systems

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
You know it's a lot of hopes and dreams

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
But we'll actually have to see what happens

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I mean it'll be a very interesting spring

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
My parents got a Blu-Ray player

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Which kind of surprised me

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Because they're not usually on the cutting edge

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Of all the technological gadgets

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And I was playing with their Blu-Ray player a little bit

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
And it was slow

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
It was so slow

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
And I'm sorry I know sometimes we get the mail

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Like you guys only pick on Sony

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
We hate Sony

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Because if we hated Sony we would so have a PSP oriented website

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
But anyway it's beside the point

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
But seriously it was slow and clunky

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It reminded me

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah it's the first generation I kind of think

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Okay well the first DVD player we ever had

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Was kind of slow and clunky too

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I remember when I had a single speed CD-ROM drive

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Now that's slow shit right there

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Well Rob you know what

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
What?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-Ray player

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Why?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
We got an HD DVD player

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Did you? Did you get the one for the Xbox?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Yes we did, 50 bucks

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Nice

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Oh yeah because they're so cheap now

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Well the only movie I really want on it is Stardust

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
So I don't care what else Dan gets

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You picked up a couple of movies

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
But I don't really care because that's all I'm getting

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
There you go

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Nice

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Alright well obviously Metal Gear Solid is one thing many PlayStation 3 fans are looking forward to

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
But there's also Metal Gear Online

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
And we already talked about

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
In a previous show the Metal Gear Online

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Starter Pack that's supposed to be going out

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
With Metal Gear Solid 4

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Well they're going to be beta testing Metal Gear Online

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
In late April

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
But here's the deal

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
You will get guaranteed access

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Quote unquote to this limited beta

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
It's a little bit reminiscent

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It seems to me like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I think

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
There you go

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
But I'm sure most people that would be into Metal Gear Online

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
This is just incentive I guess to get pre-orders out there

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Which makes sense to me

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
That Sony would want that

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Because they're going to want strong numbers out the gate

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
It's impossible to try and put next to

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Halo 3

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
And what I'm assuming

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Will probably be Smash Brothers numbers

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And so on and so on

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
It's kind of like their day one big seller

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It's going to be the number one game for the console

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
It's just

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Halo 3 may have

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Been the number one game

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
For the Xbox 360

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
But I don't think it's sold that many systems

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I mean I'm sure there's people that waited to buy a system

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
For Halo 3

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I don't know

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I don't believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But then again

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Their system is still more expensive

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
And it's a little easier now

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
To make that purchase now that we know

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
That Blu-Ray is going to be the high def format

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Of choice

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
And Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And we know when it's coming

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And plus now you have

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Grand Theft Auto 4 as well

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
But

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
They can't just rely on these

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Couple games to push the sales

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
They really need to put out a strong library of games

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And they have a lot of catching up to do

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Alright well

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
For you Metal Gear Solid fans

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You might want to go pre-order the game if you want to check out the

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Online beta

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
If you don't already have it pre-ordered

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Which I'm sure many of you do

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Well

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
There had been talk that Metal Gear Solid

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Was going to be ported to Playstation 2

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That's actually not happening

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It's just going

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
That the Metal Gear Solid

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Essential Collection is going to be on

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Two DVD's

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's supposed to be out on

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
March 18th for 29.99

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Over here in the US

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It's going to be a Playstation 1 game

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
That's awesome

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Well I wouldn't see

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
There would be no point to really remake

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Metal Gear Solid for Playstation 2

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Maybe there were people that were hoping

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Because there was the GameCube one

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
When it came out?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I think so

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Maybe people were hoping some of those extra frills would come over

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm surprised that they didn't put

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Metal Gear Solid 1

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And then also have VR missions

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
As well

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Well my theory is that they are going to

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
This is again just my theory

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Because really all

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
The VR missions was part of Metal Gear Solid Integral

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Which was

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Basically Metal Gear Solid done as a first person shooter

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
All you need to do is put in the camera control

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And you can play it that way

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
So they could easily

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Include the VR missions and the

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I guess integral mode

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Hmm

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Well it's neat

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I mean I guess it's not too

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
If this Playstation is backwards compatible

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
And all that at least what little

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Backwards compatibility some of them have

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It's not surprising that they only need to put it out there

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
On Playstation 1 format

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Exactly and if I remember correctly

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I believe this collection is coming out

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
In a couple weeks

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Should be able to pick it up soon

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And it's cheap 30 bucks

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Very cool

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
A really cool

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Well you know not cool for me because I already own

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
A couple PSPs but for someone that may not own

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
A PSP yet you can get a brand new PSP

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Slim that happens to be red

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
With a giant head of Kratos

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Silk screened on the back

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
This will actually be replacing

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
The Star Wars entertainment bundle

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
That they've had for a while

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
You can no longer get those unfortunately

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
And of course it will be coming out

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I believe next week

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
With the brand new game

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Of course God of War Chains of Olympus

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And some other cool stuff that will come

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
With this entertainment pack

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It will come with a copy of

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
The Superbad UMD

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
As well as a voucher to download

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Syphon Filter Combat Ops

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
From the PC Playstation store

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Now here's my only little problem

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
With this whole thing

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Usually these entertainment packs come with

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
A 1 gigabyte memory stick

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I have heard no mention of a 1 gigabyte memory stick

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
With this so

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Yay I can download a game to nothing

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You have to buy a memory stick separately

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Way to go awesome

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
This might be a bad idea

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
But do you think we're just supposed to assume

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
It's there anyway?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I don't think it is because they would have mentioned it

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It would have been a selling point

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Hey surprise me

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Maybe it is in there

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm just going to take a while to guess

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
As they didn't mention it

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And I don't think it was in the press release

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Although I will double check in just a second here

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I'm pretty sure it does not come with a memory stick

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Which is kind of sad

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Now Alpha Canagram in chat says

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Loki bigger sizes are dirt cheap

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
1 gig is useless

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
That's fine okay

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
But the fact is it's still stupid to offer

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
A free downloadable game

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
A voucher or whatever

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
That's worth I guess 10 bucks

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
When you don't have anything to store it to

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Well here's my thought

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
What about the fact that

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
My roommate was hooking up a new printer today

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And it didn't come with a USB cable

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
To hook it up to the computer

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
So it's kind of that same logic to me

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Batteries not included except now it's other things

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Memory not included

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I understand

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Buying a game console back in the day

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Didn't come with a memory card

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
To save your games and stuff

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It's completely optional but

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I mean come on

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
God of War, Chains of Olympus, Syphon Filter

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
You're going to need a memory stick

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And it's just kind of annoying that you get it all home

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Or something you get it for Easter or something like that

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
And it's like

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Yeah I'm ready to play this game

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Aw shit I gotta go drive back down to the store

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
To pick up my memory stick

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I don't know I think it's still kind of cheap

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But whatever

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I mean if that's kind of your thing

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Then go ahead and purchase it

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
And it'll probably be limited

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Since the last one was too

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Although I think

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Most people that are all crazy about God of War

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Most of them probably already have a PSP don't you think?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
That's always what amazes me about these

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Bundles that come out so much later

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
But oh yeah this is also coming out

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
In June-ish I mean that around

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
That time frame so it's going to be three months after

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
The game actually comes out

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I don't know it's cool I guess if you don't

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Have one yet I mean maybe

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
You might think about picking this up

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
But to be honest the only reason I picked up

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
My Daxter bundle was because it was the only thing

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Available at the time so

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
It wasn't like I really wanted to play Daxter

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Another comment from chat

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
From ake ripper I think that is

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
A K E ripper

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
It's chat.orngelandstranger.com says

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Still one gigabyte you don't get far

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
You know what

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I'm using my 16 memory

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
16 megabyte memory stick

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
That came with my original PSP

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
32 or whatever it is I'm using the old school original

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
One from the first PSP bundle

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Hey you know what that's fine

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
That's the thing right now

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Say you can't

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Just throw in a 32 meg one

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Yeah I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
But hey you know what at least it will get you through

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Being able to save your game

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
And I'm sure since those

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
One gigabyte memory sticks are what 30 bucks

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Now the 32 megabyte one should be like 50 cents

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
If that

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Come on they've got to be sitting on a bunch of them

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Just dump that shit

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Hey I'm not alone

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
We have another chatter in chat and I cannot pronounce this name

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
For the life of me it's

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
TVVICHMAN

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I don't know

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Says I still use my 32 so I'm not alone

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
So there you have it

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Well you know a lot of people

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Very excited about home

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Even though it keeps kind of getting pushed back

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And pushed back but you know what they say

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
As long as there's reason and purpose

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Behind pushing it back then sometimes

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
It isn't all necessarily a bad thing

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Apparently

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Some big Sony games are going to be integrated

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Into home and those games are Warhawk

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Uncharted, Drakes, Fortune and Resistance

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Fall of Man and assumably these are just

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Three to start and you know obviously more would follow

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I imagine you know big

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Other big titles even from third party publishers

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Would be included here too

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Warhawk is going to let eight people

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Meet in like a war room area

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Prior to a match and you can make out

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Your strategies on a sand table

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
That's like a replica of the different levels

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
In the game and then you go right from there

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Into your match so

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Kind of cute and then Resistance and

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Uncharted basically your avatars

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Can go into levels from those

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Games and that would allow you

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
To get to parts of the game that are even completely

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Unseen now in addition to that

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Uncharted is supposed to have a 2D shooter game

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
That's built into it that launches from home

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
So that's some cool ideas

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
That sounds fairly

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Generous and kind of neat

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
You know I imagine the shooter

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Is cheesy but it's better

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Than nothing and it's probably kind of one of those

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Like cool little you know integrations

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
The news about

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Home is very exciting and it makes

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Me wish it would have been out a lot sooner but

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
You know okay if the delays are making it better

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Then it's hard to complain right? It's all part of their plan

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
To hopefully get more momentum I mean and this is

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Also stuff that they can say look here

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Live does not have this

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
This is why you should buy a PS3

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
They're giving us reasons now why you should

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Own a system which is what they should have been

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Doing since the beginning

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Frisbee in chat says push it back

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Until no one cares am I right?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I don't know but the more they drop little tidbits

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Like this it's hard to ignore

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Yeah but at the same time though it's like

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You know Duke Nukem Forever

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Come on dude I would like to see a little

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
More video of this stuff

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
In action not just screenshots I mean

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
You know just because that really

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Video helps you get so much more of a sense

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Of what it really looks like than pictures

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
The trophy room thing

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
It's kind of neat I guess but at the same time

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I'm just like whatever

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Like I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And see a stupid dragon from Lair

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I'd be like wow

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Testament that you played Lair

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Man you suck

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Well you know what though Xbox is the same thing with the achievements

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
You know you get certain achievements

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Well it's like I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room of like

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Achievements that they've earned during like you know

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Totem Ball or some shit

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
You played the game for ten hours or something

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Wow you have dedication

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
You pressed start

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Achievement unlocked wasn't that one in the Simpsons game

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Madden or

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Simpsons maybe or Avatar

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
You hit something eight times in a row

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
1000 points unlocked

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I don't know Jamie are you excited about

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Home on Playstation 3

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Relatively

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I'm excited because it's free if I had to pay for that shit

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I'm not playing in home

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Free is a good thing

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Then again Yaris was free

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Oh that is a good point

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Touche from Jamie

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Well there actually

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Is a date now for that

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Dual Shock 3

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Over here in the US we're getting it on April 15th

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
For $54.99

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And I don't want that for my birthday

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
So nobody get it for me

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
But it's

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I mean it's basically

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
From what I can tell in here

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
The 6 axis with vibration

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
So

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
So basically it's the controller that should have come out

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
The first time it's finally coming out

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Yeah except for all the crappy legal

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Problems they were having

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
What was the price again on that

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
That's a $54.99

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
$54 bucks for a freaking controller

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
But then again Xbox is just as bad right

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Isn't it like $59 for their wireless

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
It's the same price as their current controllers

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
He rumbles $5 extra

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I guess

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
That is too damn much for a controller

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Wait no I actually rumble

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Well tilt sensors in rumble are $5 extra

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Well it is also wireless

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
But still

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Yeah the wireless controller

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I don't know

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I don't give Xbox a pass here either

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I think their controllers are way too expensive too

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And then the Wii one is just as bad too

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
The controllers are way too damn much money

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I have to say something though for the Xbox 360

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Controllers that the keyboard attachment is cool

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Really?

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I haven't even really played with one ever

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Remote nunchuck because the remote is $40

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And the nunchuck is $20

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
So it's $60 all together

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I don't know I guess maybe for some reason

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I let Nintendo slip by a little more

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
And I know people want to call it fanboyism

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
But I don't here's my logic

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Because that controller is

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Really kind of like the core of the system

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
And the motion and everything

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
But I don't know I guess one could argue that

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
It's the same thing on the Playstation 3

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I don't know what the motion should on the Playstation 3

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Is very like kind of

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Last minute?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Not really last minute

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
But just kind of useless I think

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I like this comment from Alpha Canagram in chat

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
He says Skye wait

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Was most expensive

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
That's true because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
If you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
You had to get four of those

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
You know we actually still kept our Game Boy Advance for that reason

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
So that we could play Pac-Man vs.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I was going to say I can only think of like

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Three games that even use that feature

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Not four because there's Animal Crossing was one

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
And yeah Animal Crossing

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Pac-Man vs. Crystal Chronicles

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And Zelda for sorts

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And that's really it just a handful of games

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
But Pac-Man vs. is awesome

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
You start to see more of that stuff too

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Didn't Pac-Man vs. come out on the Namco Museum DS?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Yes that's right

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
It's pretty cool

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It is pretty cool

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Not enough to get me to buy Namco games all over again

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Those classic collections that keep re-releasing

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Random thoughts

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Speaking of classic collections

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
It just kind of made me go huh

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I was randomly at a record store earlier this week

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Because I was gasping shock and awe

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Buying a CD I know I know

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I was actually buying a CD

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
And this place sells video games as well

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
They sell used video games

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
And I actually saw on the play

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
And I was actually looking at like old Genesis

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
And Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Like really like cool in the retro stuff

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
It was all sports

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
It was all sports stuff like Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
So that's pretty much all they had

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
But one thing I noticed on the Playstation 2

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Is an Activision anthology

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
And I never even knew this game existed

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Because the Activision releases an anthology

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
On every system

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
You know they had one on Playstation 1

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
They've had one on the PC

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I actually own the one on PC

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
They've had a ton of them

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I didn't realize they had one on Playstation 2

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
But I just thought it was funny

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Because I'm reading the back of the box

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Like all the games that are in it

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
And like this is how they're selling the game

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Is that A it talks about you can do cool effects

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
To the games while you're playing

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Like you can play Pitfall

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It's even an Activision compilation

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Pitfall 2 and some of these other

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Like really obscure Activision games

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
The other ones that were listed were very obscure

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Like Bridge

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
What's that?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I think I'm going to order a freeloader

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
You're going to order the Activision one?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
No a freeloader

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Oh freeloader? Oh

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
We'll talk more about that a little later I bet

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
So another person jumping from the Sony ship

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Would be Phil Harrison

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
He's actually resigned from

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Sony Computer Entertainment

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Which is sad because that only leaves

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Kaz left and

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Luckily though it's not

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Was it not

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Oh god

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
The crazy guy

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Ken Kutaragi

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Thank god he's not the only one left

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Piloting this boat here

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
No that does leave Kaz

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I believe there were some rumors on where

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
He was going to go

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Between Atari

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
To I don't know why he would jump

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
From one ship to another sinking ship

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
But whatever

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
But sad to see him go because

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
He was actually kind of a voice of logic

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
I guess for the company

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
But who needs that?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Really

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I don't know

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
But that is weird

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
If it's true he went to Atari

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
That's kind of like

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I don't know but maybe he can help fix things there

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
That would be nice to see them turn around

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Alright well

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
With all this talk about Lost Odyssey

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And what a great RPG it is

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
That were actually really amazing

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
One of them was Persona 3

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
And I admit I did not get to really play much of Persona 3

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Because apparently

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Persona FES which is an expansion

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
To Persona 3

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Is coming out here in the US on April 22

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
And it will set you back $29.99

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
But the cool thing about it

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Obviously this is a Playstation 2 game

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
It's not in the current gen of consoles

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
It's in Playstation 2

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
But obviously that's what a lot of people still have

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
But for such a low price

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
For such a huge game

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
You get both the enhanced version of Persona 3

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And new bonus features

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
And a new chapter that is apparently 30 plus hours

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
So this is kind of like Oblivion game of the year edition

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
But for Persona

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
5 bucks which isn't bad

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
There's still pretty good stuff coming out in the Playstation 2

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And luckily a lot of the people

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That put out really crappy shovelware games

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
For the PS2

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Have now moved to the Wii

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
So you get a pretty good crowd

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Although there are still some

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
But luckily now they've adopted the price point at $14.99 retail

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Which you can't beat that

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Even if it does suck

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Well you can download a lot of games

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
For five bucks

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
So I don't know $14.99 still feels too expensive

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
For me for a crap game

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
You know Hannah Montana goes to college

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Or whatever the hell they put out

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I don't know I pulled that name out of thin air

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
You want to know what status I think they would make that game?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
They just might

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Patent pending

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
She goes to college, she's rich

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Even if I were really rich I would want to be fully educated

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
True

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
But then again if you're

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I think in my mind it's the perfect

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
A puppet of Disney then

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
In my mind it's a sitcom

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Just like Saved by the Bell went to college

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
At one point

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney channel stars

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Need to go to college at some point

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
That's their exciting surroundings

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
That would have saved Brittany from her fate

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Perhaps

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Goofy goes to college

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Can I read the next story please?

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
You may

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Well Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It says it will be out in time

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
For the winter holiday

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
To be

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Politically correct

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I'm so excited that they're releasing Game On Festivus

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Decemberween

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Gives you something to celebrate

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
It's island themed

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Which is so, you know

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Wintery

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
That might be kind of fun though

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I did think the first one had too much dirt

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
This one seems to have plenty of dirt in it too

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
It's in the middle of a desert

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I'm sorry

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Too much dirt for you

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Although, you know what

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I really have to say that

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
The artist's joystick

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Where we got this information from

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Are very creative

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Because I don't think they've done a

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Good off-road moon racing game

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Actually

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
There was Cruise in the World

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Cruise in the World had you go play on the moon

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
And then you ran into aliens

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
That had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Thank you

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Malholus in chat

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I hope I'm pronouncing that right

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
We have a lot of new chatters tonight

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Malholus in chat says

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Moon Patrol

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Damn straight

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
That's all the moon game you need

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I was just thinking

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
There's all these bastardized Atari games

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
From years past

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Why didn't they ever put out a bastardized Moon Patrol?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
That's what I'm curious about

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
What picture am I looking for?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
The screen capture

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
They took a picture from Motorstorm and put

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Microsoft Paint

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I have to show this in the chatroom because it's hilarious

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Oh, I just thought of it

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Hannah Montana

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Goes to her first frat party

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Hannah Montana

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
goes wild

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Hannah Montana gets a podcast

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
They already do crap like that

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
It's called the evening news

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
There you go, Malholus again

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Hannah Montana goes to the moon

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
There it is, right there, two things we need

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Alright, enough of this

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
We do not need more Hannah Montana

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
We need less Hannah Montana

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
What we do need more of

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Is more colors in PS3

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
And there is a rumor

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I was just thinking that

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I know, I wasn't

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I can read minds

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
It's a

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
It's a skill I learned

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
So

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
There is a new SKU coming out for the

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
48 PS3, I know this for a fact

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
The Blu-Ray

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Because Sony thinks, you know what

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Blu-Ray is the winning format

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
You will just buy your own fucking

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Blu-Ray movies

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
So there is going to be a new SKU coming out

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
And apparently

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Some Circuit City employees

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Have begun receiving their shipments

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Of these new PS3s

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
And on the shipping box there is a model number

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
Which is CECHH01

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
And for those who may remember

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
A while back when we covered that the FCC

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Had a

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Item filed from

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Sony regarding a white PS3

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
While the item numbers

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Happened to match

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
So is it going to be the white system

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Coming out to

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Replace the black one with the

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Spider-Man 3?

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Maybe? I don't know

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
We'll have to see I guess

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
But if that's the case

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It's going to be coming soon

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Are there really people that are like

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I mean do these people really really exist

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
That are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Until they release them in white

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Or until they release them in red

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Or what are the colors that we talked about

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
The silver thing that we talked about

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
On another show in another country

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Are there really those people

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I don't think that there are

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
People maybe with the DS because it's cheaper

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
But I don't think color is really going to

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I don't know

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Sway you on buying the system or not

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
People aren't going to go

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
It's $400

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
If only it were in white

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I would really just make the purchase

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I just need something that matches the drapes

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
And black doesn't do it for me

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I fucking hate when they come out with new system colors

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Because then they have to come out with new accessory colors

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
And new everything colors

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
And it just sucks

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Lots of comments in chat

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Brad from PodCulture says

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I waited until Blue to get my DS

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
With Nintendo though it's inevitable

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
That they're going to come out in other colors

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
That is still a little crazy

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
But you'll notice whatever happened to the pink Wii

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Whatever happened to that

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
They didn't need to do it, that's what I guess

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
SSJ100Matt says

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
Damn right, I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
That would be the best

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you'd like to join in

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
We do try to keep an eye on JustinTV's chat room as well

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
But sometimes I have a hard time staying on top of that

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Because that's two different chat rooms

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
That's a lot

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Something you're going to be able to play on those

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
White PlayStations

42:52.000 --> 42:58.000
Would be lots and lots of games coming to the PlayStations store

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
25 old school titles have been leaked

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
By the European version of the PlayStations store

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Well also

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
There are some pretty cool titles in there

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
No, there are some very cool titles in there

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
That's what makes me think it's probably fake

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
It's not fake, these are from the European version of the ESRB

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Is where they got these titles from

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I thought it was the store delete

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Well they're coming to the PlayStations store

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
The PEGI

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I guess leaked this information

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
I thought it was Sony that accidentally somehow made these visible for a minute

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Well then I guess it's legit

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And there are some cool games coming out

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Bust a Groove, Holla

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Those folks that like their old school music games and stuff

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Very excited to hear that

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Crash Bandicoot 3

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Everybody's Golf, Klona

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Klonoa, sorry

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Klonoa is like the best game ever

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Kurushi Final, Motortune Grand Prix

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Namco Museum 1, 2 and 4

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I don't know what happened to 3

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Omega Boost, Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Rollcage, Spyro

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Tekken 2, 3

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Twisted Metal, Vib Ribbon

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Vib Ribbon

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
That's pretty awesome

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
That game is crack

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
And actually I don't know if a lot of people remember

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
Colony Wars is actually pretty decent as far as the space shooter goes

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Same with Cool Borders, that was pretty fun

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Omega Boost was awesome

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Son of Dad says Intelligent Cube please

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
There you go

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
He said don't they have the PSP one?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Didn't they come out with like a sequel-ish thing to that game?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Yeah they have a couple of them

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Let's see, Crunky Boy Jr. in chat says

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared it right up

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Hey, Klonoa was a great game

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
But it was messed up at the end

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Nice

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
So in other bundle-y news

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
In Europe they're going to get a

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Pretty decent bundle I'm going to say

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
That is the

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
And it's a 40GB PS3

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I'm sorry, my apologies

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
80GB

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Oh sorry, they're doing two of them

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
My apologies

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I was just staring at the red box

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Because it's, well

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Kind of red and black and very cool colored

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And it's got a silver car up on the front of it

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I can't see what it is though

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
But they are saying that

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
It's going to be

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Out on a

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
It's going to be

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Out on a

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
It's going to be out on a

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
It's going to be out on a

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
It's going to be out on a

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Looks like a

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
March 29th

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And retails for

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
$3.99 Euro

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
So that's pretty cool

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I love all this hubble-oo over

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Prologue, it's not even the actual game

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
It's just prologue

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
You know to be honest I think this game

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Is going to hurt their sales for the full game

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
You think? A lot of people like

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
If I were to, if I had to buy

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
A Gran Turismo game I don't think I'd buy the full one

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Because I don't race 200 cars

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
You know there's only a few cars

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
That actually probably race

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
And you know after I play this game

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
You know prologue for however

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Many months until the full game comes out

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I'll probably be sick of it

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
And just be like okay whatever I'm done

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I'm not going to spend another $50 or whatever

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
To upgrade to have

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
More cars

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Now the smart thing to do

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Would be to release the retail version

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Of Gran Turismo 5

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
And release a $20 update

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
That would give you all the additional cars

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
And tracks

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
That would never happen though

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
RossdielUT in chat says

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Loki Gran Turismo isn't for you it's for crazed car freaks

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
There's another bundle listed on here too

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
What's that?

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
A blu-ray bundle

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
The 40GB PS3

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
With Spiderman 300 and Casino Royale

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
On March 19th

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Now that's reasonable

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
That Blu-ray has officially won or whatever

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
That's you know totally understandable

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
There's a lot of people that are going to buy

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
PlayStation 3 just because it plays Blu-rays and games

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
To do that because that's how PlayStation 2 won

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Hey I bought my PlayStation 2

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Well actually no I didn't buy it

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
As a DVD player I just bought it because

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Armored Core was coming out on it

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
And I love me some Armored Core

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Except I didn't buy Armored Core 4

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Whatever

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I liked what Akdeft in chat says too

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
Gran Turismo 5 prologue, Gran Turismo 5 introduction, Gran Turismo 5

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
And then Gran Turismo 5 epilogue

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
And yet no Gran Turismo portable for the PSP

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
It's like Final Fantasy 7 games now at some point

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
And they'll have Final Fantasy

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
You know prologue with cars

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
You know Gran Turismo

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Gran Turismo with dress fears

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
There's different kinds of chocobos

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
Do you get to try out different chocobos?

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Well you may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
There are plenty of other games

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
To get your attention this week

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Starting things off we have Bully Scholarship Edition

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Slightly better than I guess the PlayStation 2 version

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Because it has slightly better graphics

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
And a few more missions

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Great

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
The game I teased last week

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Coming out on the DS

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Worst name ever

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
If you're into baseball

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Or most unintentionally funny name ever

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Depending on how you look at it

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
There's going to be two games for you

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Sony's MLB 08 The Show

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
And that's coming on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PSP

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
And then MLB 2K8

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
Coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360

48:42.000 --> 48:48.000
We have Army of Two coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Chicken Hunter on the DS

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
It's a stupid game where you kill chickens

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
So it's not just a clever name

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
No, it's very literal

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
And imagine Figure Skater

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
It is a game where you are a figure skater

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
And you get to do little gay ass moves

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Yay, Figure Skater

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I'm almost offended by that comment

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to Figure Skater

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Yeah, exactly

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
Let's see what else we have here

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
Also, Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Awesome

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
God of War Chains of Olympus

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Coming out on the PSP

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
That looks pretty awesome

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
Pets Bunnies for the DS

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Yes, you too can raise bunnies now

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Hooray

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Let's see

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
Just a small little game called Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
That will be coming out a week from today

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Hooray

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
Ninja Reflex is coming out on the Wii and the DS this week

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
For your Ninja themed party games

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
World Championship Cards for the PSP

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
In case you want to play something other than poker

50:08.000 --> 50:14.000
Mystery Dungeon Shiren the Wanderer coming out on the DS

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Let's see

50:16.000 --> 50:23.000
We've also got Spitfire Heroes Tales of the Royal Air Force

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
That's on DS as well

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
And Homies Rollers on the DS

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
You're like Homie the Clown

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
They can get out of those machines for 10 cents

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Oh, my boss used to collect those

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
Let's see

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I believe that's it

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Smash Brothers Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
But maybe there's a certain audience for that, I don't know

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I will tell you what

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Uh oh, what

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Oh no, here we go, here we go

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies, yes, what?

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
We'll do the whole Tingle thing and we'll burn Eye of Judgment

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
We'll need another game in there, just more of a chance

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Yeah

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Great

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
The makers of that game just thanked you for selling like, you know

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
About a hundred additional copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
Here, I'll make it even more fair, the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
So the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment now

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Yes

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
Because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell a hundred thousand copies

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Somebody mark the date and time of this

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
Oh, it's almost exactly seven o'clock here on Sunday evening, March 2nd

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
It will never sell anything, okay, come on

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Well that's something, that's giving the listeners

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
That's for the little meter some of the chatters made up

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
Some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that looks like a telethon thing

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
And it's like the road to one million copies

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
It'll never happen

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Now it gives them something to add to that

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
It'll never ever happen

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never ever sell

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Here's the thing, chat room

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
You gotta get him, you keep adding games to it

52:13.000 --> 52:20.000
Until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
Oh yeah, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Gold Banjo says another one for the OLR wiki

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I forgot to mention Housekeeping, this would have been good

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
And you can wiki stuff on it

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
Even though I guess, well we have an official Wikipedia article

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
But now we have our own freaking entire wiki

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
Which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
You'd think I wrote it or Loki wrote that article

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
But we've never really worked on that

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
It was totally the fans that did that, so that was really cool

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I haven't even seen it

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
On Wikipedia?

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
Oh, well I thought you meant, oh you meant on Wikipedia

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
A wiki set up for us

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
But now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
That's what I was talking about

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
Yes, that, well I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
It's orangeloungeradio.wikia

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
That's W-I-K-I-A dot com

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
So check it out, Orange Lounge Radio

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
And somebody just linked it in chat as well, so check that out

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
Alright, meanwhile, let's go back to traveling the globe

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
And looking at upcoming releases

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
And we'll start on the Xbox 360 in Japan

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
You get a new version of the console coming out

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
The Xbox 360 Arcade hits Japan

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
And with that comes some price reductions, yay

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
Including Riot Act, which you might know as Crackdown

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
And Saints Row gets some price reductions this week

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
On the Xbox 360 in Japan

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
Coming out on the Playstation 3, the DualShock 3 makes its way out there

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
As well as Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock finally comes out in Japan

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
The Satin Silver, that's what I was trying to think of earlier

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
The Satin Silver Playstation 3 comes out as well

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
Continuing our trip in Japan on the Nintendo Wii

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
Family Jockey comes out in Japan

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
Also Metroid Prime 3 Corruption

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
I did not realize this game had quite the delay between the US and Japan

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
But it is finally coming out in Japan this week

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
So I guess we're not the only ones that have to wait for big titles sometimes

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
It looks like Japan had to wait for this one

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
That's kind of surprised me

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
And I looked to see if it's a price reduction or something like that

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
It's not, it's full price

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
So this must be the first time they're getting that

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
So that kind of surprised me

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
And it comes with a

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Nobunaga's ambition something

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
I don't

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Online I think

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
But it comes with what's called a power-up kit

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
And I'm not exactly sure what a power-up kit has in it

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
So this is something they haven't released yet

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Perhaps

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
The same thing with Double Kings or whatever they call that over there

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
It's drugs

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Perhaps

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
But it does look like another version of Nobunaga's Ambition

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Dang, the last time I played this game was on the NES

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
And look how far it's come

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
It's like Civilization

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I remember Civ I, I have such fond memories

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
It has a Nobunaga's Ambition game that came out

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
The beginning of February

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
For PlayStation 2

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
They're too complicated for you

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I'm not smart enough to play those games

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
I'll admit it

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I think that's just exactly what it boils down to

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
They're too much for me now

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
They get too complicated

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
The Nobunaga's Ambition party game

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Yeah, they need like

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
You know how they dumb down Madden for Wii owners?

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
That's what I need

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I need a dumbed down version of Nobunaga's Ambition

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Swing the remote down to conquer Japan

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
It's too bad they don't have achievement points

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
And I accidentally closed out my list

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
So I'll tell you what

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
Why don't we go to Europe and then we'll come back to Japan

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Well you know what that actually makes me think?

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Did we ever get a current gen release of Risk?

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Not that I can think of

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
It'd be cool if we had Risk and Axis and Allies

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Wouldn't that be cool?

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
That would be very cool

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
I love games like that

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Oh wait, I got the Japanese release dates back

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Never mind

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Europe can wait a little longer

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
They're used to it

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
That was me

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
It was

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Below the bell

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
I'm sorry

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Party foul

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Dear European listeners

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Please send Rob a smack in the head

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
Send me your cards and letters

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
Send me your cards and letters

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Whatever, they get Mario Kart early

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
That's right

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
So, you know, shut up

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Go stuff yourself with a crumpet

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Hey

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I love Britain

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
I love all of Europe

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
I love France

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
I love Spain

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
I love them all

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Alright

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
On the PlayStation 2

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
Also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
And guess what

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
There wasn't enough Pachinko in your life

56:46.000 --> 56:52.000
Hisou Pachinko Pachi Slot Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of Pachinko

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
Because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
On the Nintendo DS

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
Bomberman gets a price cut

57:05.000 --> 57:10.000
Doraemon no Bitaton Midori no Kyojinen DS comes out

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
In other words, it's Doraemon on the DS yet again

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
And lastly on the PSP

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
And then I promise we can do the Europe dates

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
That is a combo kit of those games

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
It's like an Ultimate Hits

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
So there you have it

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
And also Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
The Lenneth and what was the other one?

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
Slo-Mera or whatever it was called

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
They both move into the Greatest Hits collection

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
Alright, now that all of Britain hates me

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
And Europe in general

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Let's go to their release dates, shall we Jamie?

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Fine

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Well these are all on the 7th

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
And one of them pisses me off

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
But I have a certain bias against it

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
Blacksite Area 51 on PS3

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
Bully Scholarship Edition, Xbox 360 and Wii

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed on Wii

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
Dynasty Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Jack Keane on PC

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
MX vs ATV Untamed on a bunch of crap

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
The Destiny of Zorro on Wii

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Victorious Boxers on Wii

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
And the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K Dawn of War

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Victorious

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Oh Victorious, I thought you said Victorias

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
And I'm thinking like, is that like Victoria's Closet for men?

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
Like now they're expanding

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
You mean Victoria's Secret?

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
She has a penis?

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
No, I thought you said Victoria's Closet

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
Oh maybe

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
That was a really crappy show

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
That was Veronica's Closet, it was Chrissy Alley

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
No, Victoria's Secret

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
I thought I heard her say Victoria's Boxers

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
Maybe my mind is just focused on underwear right now, I don't know

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
See, you said Victoria's though

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
These boxers are victorious!

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I'm thinking up Spice Girls

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
If they're a pair of boxers and on the back of them is a big peace sign

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
You know, like the V for victory or whatever

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
A hand doing a V

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Please, let's change the topic

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I hate Warhammer 40K

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Why?

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
Because I had an ex who did nothing but play Warhammer 40K and paint his retarded little models

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
On and for days at a time

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
I tried painting those once and then I saw that they're 6mm tall

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
I'm like, fuck this, I am not doing this

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
And I'm a big gamer, I love gaming

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
But there just comes a point where there's this weird obsession with the little figures

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
And for building terrain from scratch

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
And that's all he ever did

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
So yeah, I broke up with him to play with, you know, to hang out with some guy that played rifts

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
It was fun though, running over those little figurines with a toy train

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
Because, you know, if you're going to build your own landscape

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
You might as well already have a train set and landscape built already for that

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Well, I can understand having a project, that's one thing

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
But when your entire life is your project, that's a little something else

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
That and you didn't have a job

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Speaking about building little figurines

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spinoffs for different games

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Including Indiana Jones and Star Wars

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
But they have screenshots to prove that it's real

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
You know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But, sure, if you want to believe

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
The minute I saw a headline that said

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I was like, oh, haha, funny, April Fools joke

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I hate April Fools

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
You know

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It would be cool if it were real

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I don't think it is

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And I don't think you would try

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
It's not, come on

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
You know

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And, of course, it's their exclusive, they say

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
And stuff like that

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Trust me, if this wasn't a real exclusive

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
1UP.com would be whoring the shit out of this

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Right now, okay

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Because they like to tease their exclusives

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Whatever

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
You don't need any more Halo

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Or Lego Halo

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Well, I almost thought this was a joke when I first read about it too

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
But, no, it is true

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And it's one of the more interesting types of development in gaming

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I've heard in a long time

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Okay, here's the thing

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You know Treasure made a shooter years ago called Bongio

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Bongio

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Bongio

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Which is not a classic game

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah, well, that's right

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
It's coming out on the DS, right

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
As Bongio Spirits

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Yay

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
That's not the part I thought was a joke

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Here's the part I thought was a joke

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It uses what's called sound load

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And what you do, you share custom levels

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
High scores and replay videos

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
But you don't do it using the built-in Wi-Fi or any of that

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
No, no

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
It's sound

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
That's right

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Because the DS has a microphone and a speaker

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I guess you put the DS's really close to each other

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And what happens is that the data is turned into noises and sound

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And it's played out the speaker of, you know, your DS

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And then your friend picks it up on his microphone

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Or his or her microphone DS

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And turned back into game data

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
What a weird concept

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And the other

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It's Treasure

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Treasure's

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And the other thing you can do with this

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Is you can put them in like MP3 format or whatever

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
And spread them out on the internet

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So people can download them that way

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
It's Treasure

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It's kind of neat, I'll admit

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
But I totally, like when I first read this

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I'm like, this is the weirdest thing I've ever heard

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
But yeah, and then I'm thinking like

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Wow, we could like put a custom level on our podcast

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And be like, okay Bongio owners, turn on your

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
You know, and that's probably exactly what they want

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Which is why this feature's in there, but

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Let's do that

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Because everybody loves listening to the sound of a modem

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
When you pick it up

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Or if you put a CD in a regular

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Or if you put an old CD-ROM in a regular CD player

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And you're like

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
It was like

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Did you ever put in the Symphony of the Night CD

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And then listen to the hidden track?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Yeah, but the thing about PlayStation

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yes, I have done that

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
But the thing about PlayStation discs

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Is for whatever reason

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I don't know if this is the coding or whatever

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
But if you try to play track one on a PlayStation disc

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
It's silence

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
You won't hear the noise that you will

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
In like an old school

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Like, go find yourself a copy of Encarta

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And put it in a regular CD player

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And if you know what I'm talking about

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
You're old school

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Because we did this in junior high

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
We would take a copy of Encarta

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And put it in a regular CD player

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And it makes the most hideous noise

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And what you do is

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It was like the dumbass joke you would play

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Is that you would turn the radio thing up

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Full blast

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Close the door

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And run

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Ah, yes

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I just remember putting them in

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Especially, they'd also do it on PC Engine duo discs

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Who say, this is a game disc

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Do not listen to this

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Or your speakers will die

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
That type of thing

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Very interesting feature

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I almost

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I have to admit

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I kind of

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Like, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
To go run out and buy

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Or even really check out

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Just because there's too many other games on the table, right?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But now I'm kind of like

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I might have to look at this game

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Just for this feature

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I'll tell you

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
In one word

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Why I'm getting this game

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Why?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Treasure

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I should have known

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Treasure

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
This whole reason why

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I'm still looking for Chameleon Twist

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Alright, well

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Let's move on

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
That's all I have to say

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Until the game comes out

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Well, I know that

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Quite a number of our listeners

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Are into Rock Band

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
So, something that everyone should be happy about

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Is that there is

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
A Grateful Dead pack

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Coming out for Rock Band

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
That will have

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
China Cat Sunflower

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Casey Jones

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Sugar Magnolia

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Trucken

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Franklin's Tower

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And I Need a Miracle

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I think that that's

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Pretty cool

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Because, you know, Grateful Dead is pretty cool

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Now, I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Because that would be the full dead experience right there

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You know what?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
You laugh about that

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Apparently

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Okay, one of my customers

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Oh no

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
No, no, no, no

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Not about the weed thing

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
No, one of my customers actually

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Saw the kit set up

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
At one of the Game Stops to guest in

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And it was actually pretty funny

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
He said it just looks like a fog machine with lights

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And the lights basically hook up to your sound

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
They're all sound activated

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Like, you know, your sound out

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Or whatever your stereo system

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And they react to the sound that you do

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
So we could do the show

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And it would react to our speaking and stuff

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Just what we need

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
And that would be funny

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Alright, I'm sorry though

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Well, there's a little bit more to this story

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Hmm

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
For people who are not so rock band oriented

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Actually, No Doubt's having some releases on there

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Which, No Doubt, cool

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Gwen Stefani's solo, bad

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Because she sucks

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
That and she's got mental problems

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But, moving on

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Wow, tell us what you really think

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
What songs are coming out from No Doubt?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Do we know?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Don't Speak

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Excuse Me Mister

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And Sunday Morning

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
That's the song I love

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
No

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
No Just a Girl

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
No Spiderwebs

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
But, I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
So I'm happy

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
What song is that?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Don't Speak

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Don't Speak

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Alright, let's hear some clips of these songs

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
That are coming to rock band very soon

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Here's a clip of the Grateful Dead

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So, if you got them, smoke them

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Just kidding that's bad

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in rock band

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And then we have coming to

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Not coming to Grateful Dead

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Coming to Guitar Hero 3

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
We have No Doubt

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
So let's play one of the more lesser known songs

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Which would be Sunday Morning

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Sappy Pathetic Little Me

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
That was the girl I used to be

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000
You had me on my knees

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I'm glad I breathed some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and rock band in general

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Rock band, the wheels keep on turning with that game

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Proud Mary keep on burning?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I don't know

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Not yet, maybe someday

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Anyhow

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And not to be outdone

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
From the studio that brings you Hannah Montana

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Disney has announced a brand new game for the

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
No!

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
It's Ultimate Band

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
You know, fuck this rock band shit

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
It's the Ultimate Band

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
One thing though that you will be happy to know

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And maybe this might be a sad thing

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Is that there will not be any peripherals for this game

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
It'll be all with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
So you have to imagine how you're gonna actually play these songs

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
They have a screenshot that shows apparently the guitar portion of the game

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Which looks like it's gonna use the two buttons on the nunchuck as your fret buttons

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
So you have two fret buttons

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
You have one, two, zero, or both

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
This sounds like Ultimate Suck

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
You know what?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I'm gonna say something pretty daring here

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I think this actually isn't a bad idea

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Because think about who this game is aimed at

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It's aimed at kids

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And parents don't want to spend all this freakin' money

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
On all these peripherals that their kids are gonna destroy

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
So you know what? If you've got a Wii

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Why not come out with a game that's very similar to Rock Band

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But that you don't have to buy all this extra shit for

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
And of course I'm not gonna like it

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Probably Jamie, Matt, they're not gonna like it

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
It's not really made for us

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I'll try it

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
It's a kids game

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I don't think I'd buy this game

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
But I'll try it

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And the DS version will have that brand new

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
CD gamer online social network

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Which is sounding pretty awesome

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And I really kind of want to check it out

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
But that means I have to buy a Disney DS game

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And I don't know

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
ActDeft in chat says

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Skye speaks the truth

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And GS68 says

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Skye is right

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Ego++

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
The chat room actually just reminded me

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming week

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
What's that?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Oh I bought Parappa

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Oh rad

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
For $15

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
At a Hollywood going out of business

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Let's see, RasteelUT says

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Skye, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the Flames will disagree

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Yeah well he's a freak

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Hey did I just call a 7 year old a freak?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Cool

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
That's fine, he's a freak

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Uni in chat says

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Kids already nom nom the hell out of the Wii remote

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii remote and hid it under the couch

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
If you're 7 year old nom noms the Wii remote and hides it under the couch

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
You got issues

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I don't like that phrase, that's funny

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
What, nom nom?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Nom nom

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Didn't you hear?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Everything is Caturday now, everything

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Lolcat speak

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Cronkyboyjr tries to put out a zinger here saying

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You mean we save money on Wii peripherals?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Ba dum bum

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Get it?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Because the remotes are so fucking expensive

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
You don't really have real Wii peripherals

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I mean after all there's like what, the classic controller and the nunchuck

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Everything else is plastic shit

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Alright well

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
You know a lot of folks are very excited about this

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I'm sure Mo, remember Mo from a couple weeks ago?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yes

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I'm sure she's very excited about this

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Still Alive is going to be coming to Rock Band

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And Valve threw a little party at Game Developers Conference

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And get this, some guy actually tried to steal the song

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Here's how it worked, Jonathan Colton was up on stage with his band

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
They were playing Still Alive but in Rock Band

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Because apparently he didn't get 100% on vocals

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Which is ironically hilarious

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
But whatever

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So they finish, crowd is cheering

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And what happens is that this guy from the crowd gets up on stage

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Walks over to the 360, pulls out a memory card

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Which I don't know who carries 360 memory cards with them on the go

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I mean back in the day I used to carry a Playstation memory card

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
When I go to the arcade and stuff

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Because DDR machines had the memory card slots

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
You could have two or three of those

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I can't think of any reason why you would put a 360 card in your pocket everywhere you go

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
But whatever, it's Game Developers Conference, whatever

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
So he pulls out this memory card

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
He puts it in, messes around

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And then finally one of the Harmonix guys walks over

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And says what's going on

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And this guy says I'm just grabbing Still Alive

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Everyone needs to be able to play this

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Well the developer took it back

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And deleted the thing off the card

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
And all is well

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Because it was probably a dev 360

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It wouldn't have worked anyways

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Which we'll get into later

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Well apparently the guy actually wrote about it

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
The only reason I'm not giving this idiot of the week award

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Or stupid guy of the week

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Or whatever we're calling it in your award

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Is because apparently the guy wrote about it in his live journal

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And I don't know, don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
It could be fanfic or some shit

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I don't know

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
But I think it's legit

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
You can check it out on his live journal

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It's algorithmancy.livejournal.com

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
That's A-L-G-O-R-I-T-A-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
And he writes in this entry on February 21, 2008

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
He writes his side of the story

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And he puts a disclaimer at the end

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
He says don't try this at home

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
The only reason I did

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Because I am an acquaintance of Alex

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Who works at Harmonix

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
As well as good friends with several Harmonix folks

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And game industry friends give each other free swag all the time

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material is theft

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
So

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Huh

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
He's got a cool live journal name

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That's it

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
It was kind of a dumb thing to do

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
But at least he admits it was a little

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It was a lot of a dumb thing to do

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
At least he kind of admits in his live journal thing

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
That it was a lot of dumb

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
So you know

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I'm not going to stupid award him

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
When he begs for mercy

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
That's what you get when you drink lots of alcohols

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Exactly

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Alcohol bad

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
But still alive

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Good

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Alright, before we wrap up

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Huh, what's that?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I said quite

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Before we wrap

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in the studio?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
No

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Did you hear our idea

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I don't remember if this is the week you were gone

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Because February was all fucked up

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
But were you here the week we had the idea

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
That when it comes out

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
We'll get Mo back

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
And she'll be our vocalist

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And we'll get Matt to play drums

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
You can play guitar

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
You and I can work out the guitar somehow

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And we'll have an OR band

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
And we'll do our rendition

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
It was mentioned last week

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Was it last week?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I can't remember

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I'm getting old and the weeks blend together

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
That's okay Rob

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Alright

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Anyhow

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I'm still bringing you your birthday present

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Sweet

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Alright

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Speaking of getting old

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
The older we get

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
The more we reminisce about the classic games

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And that's why we like to pay tribute

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
To the classic game of the week every week

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Dark Sakura likes to respect her elders

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
In the gaming world

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
By paying tribute to old classic games

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
So let's dust off a dusty game

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And see what Dark Sakura's picked

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
For this week's classic game of the week

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
What is it?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
This is actually one of my favorite arcade games ever

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
And I have it on Saturn

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It's Cyber Troopers Virtual On

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Which is a 3D robot fighting game

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Done from a behind the view

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Of your own character who you're playing

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Let's take a listen

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:50.000
And almost every other sample of it online was horrible

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
So moving forward

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
You basically play as a virtualoid

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
A giant robot controlled by a person

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Which is actually pretty funny

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Because there are little insert things

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Where the pilots go in the back of the market for Saturn

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
In the sequel Virtual On

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Oritario Tangrum was a dreamcast

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Which I have that game too and I got it

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
But you would play as a number of them

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
With different specialties

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Like you have the Temjin

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Which is the balanced one

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
You have the Raiden

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Which is a heavy battle one

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Really strong and heavily armed

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
You have the Amp Arms

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Which is one of the fast ones

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
It uses a tom-po weapon

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
You have Belgor

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Which is a missile launcher

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
The Dorcas

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Which is another pretty heavy one

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
The Viper 2

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
The Basbal Bow

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And my favorite which is the Feiyen

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Which is like the cute world

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
The Mecha

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Which is really fast and nice

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
You have the Z-Grat

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And then you have the Jaguarladi

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Which is as far as I remember

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I think it was one of the hidden ones

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
But in the arcade you had a 2% set up

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And it had a dividing wall in between

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
So you were like in the cockpit

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And it used two sticks to control it

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And on Saturn they did release the twin sticks

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And I actually don't have them

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Which makes me very upset

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Because I had a chance to get them

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
They did do an Oratorio Tangram

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
That was on the Dreamcast

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I actually do have the twin sticks for that

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
In fact, you remember your ex-roommate?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Yes

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
We beat him getting them

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Interesting

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
We're not talking about the one I lived with

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Oh, we're talking about that room

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
That roommate

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Wow

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Those were the days, man

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Those were the days

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
The guy who sold it to us

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Ended up being

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
My husband

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Ended up being

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I do believe Mo's manager

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
It's

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
You know, I know

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
We're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
But at any rate

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
We came in

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
We saw the twin sticks for 45 bucks

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Which was astounding at that time

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And like

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
We want to buy these right now

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And I was like

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Okay

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And then

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
A person who's

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
As far as I knew

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
His nickname

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Came from this game

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Came in and we beat him by like 10 minutes

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
There were also other versions

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
There was

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Cyber Troopers

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Virtual on Force

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
That was only in Japanese arcades in 2001

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Virtual on Mars

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Which was

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
The PS2 release

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
There's also an audio drama for it

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Which is kind of funny

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And then there was a musical one

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Which was the

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
The Feiyun robot singing

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I actually have a Feiyun garage kit that I still have yet to put together

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
That I bought like six years ago

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Nice

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Virtual on's like

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Tops

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Alright

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Well that's going to do it

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Your classic game of the week

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Virtual on

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Here on Orange Lawn's radio

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And on that note

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
We're going to go ahead and take a break

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
It is the end of part A

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
That's right

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
It's not a short show this week

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
We're all here

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
It's like you're finally getting a full OLR

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Now it's like three weeks later

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
After

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Jamie being sick

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Us having no show

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
And then having a short show

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
The month of February was screwed

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
But there's plenty more of

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Regular

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Good old fashioned

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Hopefully unbroken

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
OLR left

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
To go

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Lots of stories coming up in part B

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
If you thought part A was PlayStation heavy

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Which it was

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Because there was a lot of PlayStation news this week

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Which

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Hopefully those people that email us every now and then say

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
You don't show Sony enough love

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
You guys hate Sony

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Hopefully

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
We did you wrong tonight

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
We have plenty of Sony

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Sony stories tonight

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
But in the next segment

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Lots of Nintendo news came out as well

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
So we'll be getting all the Nintendo news in the next segment

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And some other randomness

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Such as

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
What is the guy that created Pong up to now?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
You might be surprised

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So we're going to take a quick break

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And we'll be right back with more of Orange Lawn's radio

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Right after this

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Orange

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Lawn's

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Radio

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Hi guys

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
It's Rob here with an important footnote

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
For our podcast listeners

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
There's no easy way for me to break the news

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
But part B this week was lost

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And unfortunately won't be hitting the podcast feed

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
And you won't get that news we promised

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Unless you were listening live

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And heard all two hours of it being taped

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
So I'm sure you're wondering

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
What happened?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Well what happened is that we were

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Taping the shows we always do

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
We do a special little show after that called The Afterbirth

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
It's only for live listeners

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And because we play licensed music and stuff

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
That we can't put on the podcast

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And as we were taping that

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Right at the very end

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
We were trying to unjumble some of the chords back here

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
And the power cord to the computer got detached

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And the whole damn thing shut off

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
And although Audition keeps a temporary file on hand

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
When I went in to recover the file

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I'm in a mistake and ended up deleting the damn files

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I was trying to make a backup copy of it

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
And I've tried everything

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I can't get

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
It's not in the recycle bin

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Picked the chat room's brain on it

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
It's gone

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
It ain't coming back

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
So I'm very sorry

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And just when I was thinking March wouldn't be as broken as February

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Anyhow

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I guess one silver lining to this

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Is that if you do want to hear part B

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It is still archived on the Justin TV channel

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So you can go to Justin.tv slash Orange Launch Radio

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
And I believe some of our listeners are trying to make a highlight of the show right now

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Now it's become this big lost archive of the show

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
It's like a collector's item of sorts

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
We will try to get an audio rip of that

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
We're probably not going to put it on the podcast feed

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Because the audio quality on Justin TV is not great

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Our microphones don't hook into that

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
It simply goes to our webcam

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
And the audio is really not great

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
We'll probably, if anything, if we can get an audio rip of that

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
We'll probably put it on MySpace, Facebook, and all that stuff

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Unfortunately part A, as all the podcast listeners are going to get this week

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I am so sorry

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
In six years that we've been doing this show

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
We've never lost a show like that

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
So it's kind of embarrassing

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
And a little sad

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Especially off of a few broken weeks in a row

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
But what can you do?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Life goes on

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I hope everybody has a wonderful week

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Happy gaming

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
With all new power chords in studio

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Have a good one
