00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Sky and Loco

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, March 2, 2008

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 gets dated and bundled

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Mario Kart Wii also gets a date and online texting

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And could the game Road Rash be making a comeback?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hi

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
How are you Miss DarkSakura?

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm well

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
You're well, that's good

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes, I'm well

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
You're well, alright

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'll explain why momentarily

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Okay

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
But first I have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Hello

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Good

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Alright

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Sorry I don't have anything extra for you tonight, but you know, that's what happens

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I gotta say though, very interesting troubleshooting before the show

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
We were kind of joking last week on the show that February is the month of Broken here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
And unfortunately it looked like March was going to turn out the same way

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Because for whatever reason we have a wireless network that sits inside the house here where we tape

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And for whatever reason just last week when we were doing the short show

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
It suddenly decided that the strength is not going to be as powerful anymore

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
And the Justin TV cam would not see, that runs off an iBook that would no longer see the WiFi network

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
And then tonight Jamie's computer decided it wasn't going to see the network either

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
So I have no idea what's going on with the box

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
But very impressed with the technical skills behind

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
What did we do? We turned your computer

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
We turned my computer into a gateway

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
So it's using my wireless internet connection

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
But I have an ethernet cable and you ran it to the old router

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
And then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
So it's bouncing wireless to the router to my laptop, wireless to the other router

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
So right now

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
We'll do a piggybacking

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam which is back this week

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Hi guys

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Is going through this router

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
That goes through Loki's computer

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
That goes through the router in the house which goes to Comcast

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
And the internet

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Amazing

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
This is uber geek tech talk here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's like a wireless orgy

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Alright

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I have something for Jamie

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And it's actually her birthday present

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
And it's like six weeks early

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
What?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Yes I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Because it's something you have to prepare for

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Okay

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
So I'm going to give this to you

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Plus I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
So I think this is a good time for me to give this to you

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Okay

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
So here you go

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Open it up and see what they're tickets to

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Okay

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Alright and hopefully she likes it, I hope

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Wow I know they heard this squeak on Justin TV

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yay

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Tell the listeners what I got you

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Rob got me a ticket to see Margaret Cho

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Now in here locally

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Now I'd also like to point out, look at where the seats are

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Eee

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
That's like close

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
That's third row

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Probably look up her nose

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Third row tickets

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
So quite excited

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yay

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh my god where is this?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Davis

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Really?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
So it's not that far at all

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Cool

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
There we have it

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
So mark that date on your calendar

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
It's May something something

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm doing that right now

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Alright

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
There you go

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
So I thought that would help after a poopy week

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So like I knew I had to tell you

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Or get tickets independently somehow

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I didn't even know

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I didn't either, I got an email about it

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
So there you go

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
And I know Jamie loves some Margaret Cho and I do too

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
She's pretty funny

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Hopefully she's not quite so political

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
But you know

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
She's still somebody I like

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes me and you

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Cool

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Alright

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
There should be two there

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I was like

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Okay

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I thought so because I was like

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Why

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Okay

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
No you have to take me I'm sorry

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Of course

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Of course

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
No this is so cool

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Thank you Rob

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Alright you're welcome

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Now we can get to talking about video games yes?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Alright

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
So we're done with Tech Talk

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
We're done with Oprah

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Now let's talk

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's talk video games

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
How was your gaming week

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Dark Sakura?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
My gaming week was

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Well it was interesting

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I picked it up

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And then I had other stuff to do

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Because I watched Tron earlier in the week

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I was like

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I love Tron I want to play Kingdom Hearts

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Because of the whole Space Paranoids level

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
And there was a lot of burnout

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
And I watched Dan play a lot of burnout

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
And I played a lot of Ragnarok

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
That was it

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Alright

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Well Loki how was your gaming week?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
My gaming week was okay

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I played

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I actually picked up Pop Tippon

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
And I've been playing quite a bit of that

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
In fact that's what I was playing before the show

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
It's fun

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's different

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I like it

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I don't know

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
It's very easy to play

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
But I guess

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
It takes some time to build up your armies and stuff

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Then I played

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And I actually purchased N Plus

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
On Xbox Live Arcade

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
And that game is just as fun as the original N

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
So thoroughly enjoying that

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
And

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Because we were having this party

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
We have at the end of every month for our work

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And this one happened to be leap year themed

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And so they wanted Frogger

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
And they used my system to play Frogger

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
So I got to play some of that

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Because no one else was touching it

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And then

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
So that's actually pretty cool

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I finally got to the point in the game

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Where one of the characters dies

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Not necessarily a main character

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
But I was just very surprised

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
On how everyone makes that argument

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Of video games being art and stuff

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Well

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Shit I think there's a perfect example right there

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Of how powerful they can make the story

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And it was pretty cool

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
So

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I'm about 11 hours into it now

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Still on the first disc though

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And just taking my time through that

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Pretty much that's it I guess

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Other than the usual Saints Row

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
But

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
No one wants to hear about that

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
For the five billionth time?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Well let's see

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
In my gaming week I also played Lost Odyssey

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And I had much the same experience as you did

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I got to the second disc

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Which means you kind of go through

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Some big plot twists in the first event

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Or first disc let's put it that way

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
And I'm amazed by the game

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flak

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
As it has been

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Although you know I do understand

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Some of the little complaints about the game

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And even one of them I find to be kind of annoying

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And that is lack of save points

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
One of the things that has been bugging me

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Is that sometimes I'll be forced to sit there for an hour

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
While the next part of the game loads

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Or whatever

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I mean it just takes forever

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
It's crazy

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
To get to the next save point

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
While you watch through all these cut scenes

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I mean it's not like it's bad

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
It's not like you're bored or anything

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Or you're just getting antsy

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Because there's lots to do

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
But sometimes I only want to play in little 30 minute chunks

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It auto saves too for some things

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Some things

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
But not a lot

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I haven't had that problem with

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Save points

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
What do you think about the difficulty of the game?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It's not that difficult

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Some of the first

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Some of the boss battles

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Were surprisingly tough

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
If you grind some of the way through there

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Because a lot of this game

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Seems like it's very quick

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
There's certain areas in the game

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Where there's like 2 or 3 sections of the map

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
And then that's it

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And then you're on to the next section of the world

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Or whatever

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
It's very small

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
But I don't know

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
It wasn't that difficult

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
You just grind a little bit

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And get your characters leveled up

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And it's pretty easy

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Also I have the preorder bonus

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
So I have an item that gives me

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
A level 2 guard or whatever

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
So I can block most of the shots

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Nice, I don't have that

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
That was something you got for preorder, huh?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Hopefully they release that as a download thing later

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It will probably come later on

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Let's go over to the chat room

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
The chat room has their own comments

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
rostelut says

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
It only sucks when you die an hour without a save

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Kind of true, but there's also some things

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Where you go through cutscene, cutscene, cutscene

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And then you have to fight a big boss battle

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I know you can skip cutscenes

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
But even then

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Sometimes you have to sit there

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And hit the game engine

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
So you have to kind of sit there and press A-A-A-A-A

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You can also pause it

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And hit the back button

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
For the cutscenes, but what about the ones

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Where they're actually talking to each other

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
With the dialogue boxes, you have to A-A-A

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I don't know

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It doesn't matter

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It's honestly just a tiny little blemish

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
In what is otherwise a magnificent game

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
That deserves to be getting more attention than it is

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
As far as other games I've been playing this week

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I've been playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Because

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I was

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Loki was kind enough to loan me his Japanese copy

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And the Wii to play it on

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
So I was checking that out a little bit this week

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Didn't understand what I was doing, but I was having fun

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Playing just the massive

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Free-for-all mode

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So that was pretty cool

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Obviously, last week I was sick

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
On the show, and I'm happy to report I'm better

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I did have a sinus infection, so I had to go to a doctor

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And antibiotics and blah blah blah

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
But Loki lent me that as kind of a get better soon type thing

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Which was very nice

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I didn't actually hook that thing up till like Friday

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
That's exactly why I loaded tickets

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
This is exactly what I'm doing

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I'm not playing Smash Bros.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, even before Smash Bros. Brawl

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I never played Melee very much

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Maybe once at a friend's house

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
The first Smash Bros. Brawl I didn't even touch

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
So

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't know

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It's not really my type of game

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
It's fun

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You know

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I may pick up the US one

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Gerardimo in chat says

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Rob, do you think Brawl lives up to the hype

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Even if it's not in English

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Kind of, it's hard to tell

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I don't feel right giving a fair review

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
On a Japanese game when I don't understand how to get into

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Some of the modes and look at the extra stuff

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
It does, yeah

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Loki has no problem answering that

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
The parts I've seen so far

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Feel like Smash Bros. Melee

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
1.5 a little bit

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Because it's like the same kind of engine

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
The same stuff with just some new characters

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But I realize that's not being totally fair

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
In saying that because I haven't looked at everything

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Outside of just the brawling

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But it does seem like, you know, there's a lot of the stuff

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
They just copied right on over from the GameCube version

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Very interesting

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Frisbee says Halo 3 feels like

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Halo 2.5

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
It's a little bit that

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I don't know how to say it

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So that was my gaming week

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So if that's everybody's gaming week

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Then we will move on to talking about some news

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
But for some housekeeping

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Of which we have nothing special of note

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
What's that?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
What's that? I forget

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
The award contest thing that's going on through all games

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
That's like three months old

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I can't believe you just saw that

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I did just see that

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Hey, I don't read, you know

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I unfortunately don't read their website

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Or their forums

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
You're just too busy

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Doing other things

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I will give it a mention on air

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I don't even know if it's still going on

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I think it's kind of funny that Loki took so long to find it

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I posted a link on the forums

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Let me see

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
December 27th

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I didn't even notice it

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
All games

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Which our show runs on

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
We syndicate on their network

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
They play us Monday nights

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And I want to say

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And then Tuesday mornings

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
At 9am

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
No, because they do their regular

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
All games show at 10 now

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
But I know our show is syndicated on their network

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Mondays and Tuesdays, supposedly

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
As a best affiliate podcast

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
And it's all going on in their forums

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
The voting

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I would think it's already over

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Three months ago

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
But then again, the topics are still up

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Who knows, maybe it's an ongoing thing

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
From yesterday to today

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
They've put the votes

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
As anonymous so you can't see

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
What each podcast has

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Yesterday it didn't have it that way

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And Tigerclaw says, Sky, they still haven't announced

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
The winners, so I guess it is ongoing

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
For three months now

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And Tigerclaw, I know listens to all games

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Every other day

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I don't know

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I voted for us

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Well, I appreciate the support

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I guess, for yourself

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
But he bought a knife judgment

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And I can't support that kind of behavior

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
That's most unfortunate

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
He also dropped out of the race

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
As of like yesterday

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Didn't want to play that game

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Alright, well if you want to throw us a vote

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It's over on forums.allgames.com

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I will plug the other stuff I know we always got

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
We have our live general community at Orange Lounge

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And our Facebook is the OLR

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
You can look us up on our social networking sites

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Meet other OLR listeners

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Look at our posts and clips of the show

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
We have on some of those places like MySpace

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Tons of fun

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Alright, let's get into the gaming news

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Loki, take it away

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Ok, so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
From Destination and Playstation

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
It's the retail only conference thing

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Or whatever

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I couldn't go, but other people from my company did

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Bastards

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And of course, you know, some of the news that leaked out

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date finally

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
It's officially coming to the US

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
On June 12th

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And that of course

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Not only was leaked out

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
But confirmed by Konami

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And they also said that if you reserve your copy

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Of Metal Gear Solid 4

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Starting April 2008

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
You get Metal Gear Saga 2.0

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
A DVD to catch you up on

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
All the stuff that's going on in the series

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
As well as

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
A beta code for

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Metal Gear Online

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And then to coincide with that

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
And this

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't know if this is going to be the official

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
You know, remember because the 80GB

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Skew for the PS3 was being phased out

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Well, there's a new 80GB Skew now

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Same price, but you get

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Controller, all for $499

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Which is not a bad deal at all

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
If you don't have a PS3

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Because I know a lot of people would be buying a PS3 for that

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And it's nice that they're actually throwing in

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
The DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Separately

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
No word on when that's coming out

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
But it's supposed to come out around the same time as

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Metal Gear Solid 4, obviously

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
So, June 12th and on

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I guess

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Alright

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Well, moving on to

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Other gaming news

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Although it still has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Actually, let me

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Back up for just a minute

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Loki, how important

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Is this news to Playstation

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Fans, you think?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I think it's very important

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
The year old MotorStorm

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
They needed to update that bundle

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Anyways, because

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Shit, that game is old now

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
To throw in there, especially now that

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
The DualShock 3 controllers

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Probably not the 40GB for right now

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Because there's a

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
The one right now doesn't have it

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And I don't know if they're going to announce a new one

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Anytime soon

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's important

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I think this game is actually one of the first

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Major games for the PS3

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
That you can only get on the PS3

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
And that's

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
A little bit of fuel to Sony's Fire

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Although this is the first of hopefully many

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Hopefully it does very well

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Let's say Metal Gear Solid 4

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Does not sell

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
All that, I mean let's say

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Obviously the game is going to sell fine

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
At least mediocre

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
But let's say the game does not sell super duper well

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And doesn't move all these new bundles

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Is that going to be really bad for Sony?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Or will they get more chances?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
They may have more chances, but a lot of the stuff

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
That they're counting on is way later on

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Killzone 2 will be another one that moves

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Systems, Resistance, Fall of Man 2

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Maybe MotorStorm 2

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And then

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Final Fantasy 13, that's so far off

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
That I wouldn't even

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Consider that anything to wait for

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Right now for the PS3

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
If you're going to wait that long, you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
But

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
At the same time

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I don't know

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
It should do very well

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
But once again, you know, they're also hoping

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Blu-ray is going to sell these systems

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
You know, it's a lot of hopes and dreams

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
But we'll actually have to see what happens

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I mean, it'll be a very interesting spring

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
My parents got a Blu-ray

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Player, which kind of surprised me

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Because they're not usually on the cutting edge

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Of all the technological gadgets

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And I was playing with their Blu-ray player a little bit

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
And it was slow

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
It was so slow

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
And I'm sorry, I know sometimes we get the mail

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Like, you guys always pick on Sony, we hate Sony

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Because, you know, if we hated Sony

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
We would so have a PSP-oriented website

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
But anyway, it's beside the point

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
But seriously, it was slow

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
And clunky, it reminded me

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It's just first generation stuff

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Well, the first DVD player we ever had

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Was kind of slow and clunky, too

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I remember when I had a single-speed CD-ROM drive

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Now that's slow shit right there

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Well, Rob, you know what?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
What?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-ray player

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Why?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
We got an HD DVD player

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Did you? Did you get the one for the Xbox?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Yes, we did, 50 bucks

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Oh yeah, because they're so cheap now

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Yep

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Do you think you'll get enough library of movies to go with it?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, I don't care what else Dan gets

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You know, he picked up a couple of movies

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
But I don't really care because that's all I'm getting

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
There you go, nice

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Alright, well, obviously, Metal Gear Solid

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Is one thing many PlayStation 3 fans are looking forward to

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
But there's also Metal Gear Online

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
And we already talked about in a previous show

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
The Metal Gear Online Starter Pack

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
That's supposed to be going out with Metal Gear Solid 4

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Well, they're going to be beta testing

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Metal Gear Online in late April

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
But here's the deal

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You will get

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Guaranteed access

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
To this limited beta

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
It's a little bit reminiscent

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It seems to me like the crackdown Halo 3 thing

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I think

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
There you go, but I'm sure

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Most people that would be into Metal Gear Online

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
This is just incentive, I guess, to get pre-orders out there

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Which makes sense to me

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
That Sony would want that because they're going to want

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Strong numbers out the gate as much as possible

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
To try and put next to

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Halo 3

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
And what I'm assuming

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Will probably be Smash Brothers numbers

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And so on and so on

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
It's kind of like their day one big seller

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It's going to be the number one game for the console

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
It's just

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Halo 3 may have

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Been the number one game

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
For the Xbox 360

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
But I don't think it sold that many systems

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I'm sure there's people that waited to buy

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
A system for Halo 3

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I don't know

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But then again, their system is still more expensive

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
And

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
It's a little easier now to make that purchase

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Now that we know that

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Blu-ray is going to be the high-def format

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Of choice

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And we know when it's coming

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Plus now you have

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Grand Theft Auto 4 as well

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
But

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
They can't just rely on these

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Couple games to push the sales

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
They really need to put out a strong library of games

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And they have a lot of catching up to do

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Alright, well

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
For you Metal Gear Solid fans

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You might want to go pre-order the game if you want to check out the

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Online beta

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
If you don't already have it pre-ordered

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Which I'm sure many of you do

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Well, there had been

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Talk that Metal Gear Solid was going to be ported

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
To Playstation 2

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That's actually not happening

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
The Metal Gear

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Metal Gear Solid essential collection

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Is going to be on two DVDs

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
It's supposed to be out

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
On March 18th

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
For $29.99

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Over here in the US

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It's going to be a Playstation 1 game

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
That's awesome

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Well, I mean, there would be no point to really remake

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
You know

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Metal Gear Solid for Playstation 2

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Maybe there were people that were hoping that

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Some of the, cause you know there was the GameCube one

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
When it came out?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I think so

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Maybe people were hoping some of those extra frills would come over

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm surprised that they didn't put

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Metal Gear Solid 1

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And then also have like VR

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Missions as well

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, my theory is that they are going to

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
This is again just my theory

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Because really

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
The VR Missions was part of Metal Gear Solid

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Integral

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Which was basically Metal Gear Solid

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
All you need to do is put in the camera control

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And you can play it that way

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
So they could easily

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Include the VR Missions and the

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I guess integral mode

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Hmm

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Well, it's neat

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I mean, I guess it's not too, I mean

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
If this Playstation is backwards compatible

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
And all that, you know, at least what little

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Backwards compatibility some of them have

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It's not surprising that they only need to kind of put it out there

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
On Playstation 1 format

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Exactly, and if I remember correctly

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
There's collections coming out

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
In a couple weeks

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Should be able to pick it up soon

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And it's cheap, 30 bucks

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Very cool

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
A really cool

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Well, you know, not cool for me because I already own

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
A couple PSPs, but for someone that may not own

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
A PSP yet, you can get a brand new

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
PSP Slim that happens to be red

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
With a giant head of Kratos

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Silkscreen on the back

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
This will actually be replacing

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
The Star Wars

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
The same bundle that they've had for a while

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
You can no longer get those, unfortunately

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
And of course, it will be coming out

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I believe

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Next week with the brand new game

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Of course, God of War Chains of Olympus

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And some other cool stuff that will come

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
With this entertainment pack

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It will come with a copy of

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
The Superbad UMD

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
As well as a voucher to download

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Syphon Filter Combat Ops

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
From the PC Playstation Store

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Now here's

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
My only little problem with this whole thing

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Usually these entertainment packs come with

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
A 1GB memory stick

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I have heard no mention of a 1GB memory

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Stick with this, so

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Yay, I can download a game to nothing

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You have to buy a memory stick separately

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Way to go, awesome

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
This might be a bad idea

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
But do you think we're just supposed to assume

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
It's there anyway?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I don't think it is, because they would have mentioned it

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It would have been a selling point, but

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
You know, hey, surprise me

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Maybe it is in there, but

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm just going to take a while to guess

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And seeing as they didn't mention it

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And I don't think it was in the press release

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Although I will double check in just a second here

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I'm pretty sure it does not

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Come with a memory stick, which is kind of sad

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Now, Alpha Canagram in chat says

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Loki, bigger sizes are dirt cheap

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
1GB is useless

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
That's fine, okay, but the fact is

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's still stupid to offer

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
A free downloadable game

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
A voucher or whatever

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
It's worth, I guess, 10 bucks

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
When you don't have anything to store it to

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Well, here's my thought

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
What about the fact that

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
My roommate was hooking up a new printer today

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And it didn't come with a USB cable

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
To hook it up to the computer

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
So it's kind of that same logic to me

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Battery's not included, except now it's other things

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Memory not included

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I understand, buying a game console

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Back in the day, it didn't come with a memory card

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
You had to buy a memory card

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
To save your games and stuff

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It's completely optional

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But, I mean, come on

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Got a War Chains of Olympus

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
You're going to need a memory stick

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
It's just kind of annoying that you get it all home

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Or something, you get it for Easter

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Or something like that

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
It's like, yeah, I'm ready to play this game

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Aw shit, I gotta go drive back down to the store

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
To pick up a memory stick

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I don't know, I think it's still kind of cheap

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But whatever

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
If that's kind of your thing

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Then go ahead and purchase it

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
And it'll probably be limited

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Since the last one was too

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Although I think most people

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
That are all crazy about God of War

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Most of them probably already have a PSP, don't you think?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
That's always what amazes me about these bundles

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That come out so much later

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
But, oh yeah, this is also coming out in June-ish

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I mean, around that time frame

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
So it's going to be three months after

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
The game actually comes out

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I don't know, it's cool I guess

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
If you don't have one yet

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
You might think about picking this up

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
To be honest, the only reason I picked up

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
My Daxter bundle was because it was the only thing

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Available at the time, so

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
It wasn't like I really wanted to play Daxter

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Another comment from chat

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
From Ake Ripper, I think that is

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
A-K-E Ripper

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
It's chat.orangelandstranger.com

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Says, still, one gigabyte, you don't get far

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
You know what?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I'm using my 16 memory

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
16 megabyte memory stick

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
That came with my original PSP

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Or 32 or whatever it is

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
The original one from the first PSP bundle

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Hey, you know what? That's fine

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
That's the thing right now

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Say you can't

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Just throw in a 32 meg one

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Yeah, I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
But hey, you know what? At least it will get you through

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Being able to save your game

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
And I'm sure since those

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
1 gigabyte memory sticks are, what, 30 bucks now

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
The 32 megabyte one should be like 50 cents

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
If that

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I mean, so come on

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Just dump that shit

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Hey, I'm not alone

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
We have another chat.orangelandstranger.com

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And I cannot pronounce this name for the life of me

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
It's T-V-V-I-C-H-M-A-N

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Tovitchman? I don't know

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Says, I still use my 32, so I'm not alone

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
So, there you have it

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Well, you know

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
A lot of people are very excited about home

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Even though it keeps kind of getting pushed back

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And pushed back, but you know what they say

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
As long as there's reason and purpose

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Behind pushing it back

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Because it isn't all necessarily a bad thing

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Apparently

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Some big Sony games are going to be

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Integrated in home, and those games are

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Warhawk, Uncharted, Drakes, Fortune, and Resistance

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Follow Man, and assumably

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
These are just three to start, and you know, obviously

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
More would follow

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I imagine other big titles, even from third party publishers

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Would be included here too

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Warhawk is going to let eight people

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Meet in like a war room area

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Prior to a match

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And you can make out your strategies on a sand table

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
That's like a replica of the different levels in the game

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And then you go right from there

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Into your match

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
So, kind of cute

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
And then Resistance and Uncharted

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Basically, your avatars can go into levels

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
From those games

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
And that would allow you to get to parts of the game

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
That are even completely unseen

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
In addition to that, Uncharted is supposed to have

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
A 2D shooter game that's built into it

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
That launches from home

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
So that's some cool ideas

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
That sounds fairly generous

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
But, you know

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I imagine the shooter is cheesy

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
But it's better than nothing

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
And it's probably one of those cool little integrations

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
The news about home

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Is very exciting

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And it makes me wish it would have been out a lot sooner

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
But, you know, okay

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
If the delays are making it better, then it's hard to complain

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It's all part of their plan to hopefully get more momentum

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I mean, this is also stuff that they can say

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Look, here, Live does not have this

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
This is why you should buy a PS3

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
They're giving us reasons now

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
They're selling a system

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Which is what they should have been doing since the beginning

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Frisbee in chat says

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Push it back until no one cares, am I right?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I don't know, but the more they drop little tidbits like this

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It's hard to ignore

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Yeah, but at the same time, though

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
It's like, you know, Duke Nukem Forever

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Come on, dude

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I would like to see a little more video of this stuff in action

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Not just screenshots

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
You know, just because

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Video helps you get so much more of a sense

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Of what it really looks like than pictures

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I mean, the trophy room thing

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
It's kind of neat, I guess

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
But at the same time, I'm just like, whatever

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And see a stupid dragon from Lair

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I'd be like, wow

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Testament that you played Lair

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Man, you suck

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Well, you know what, though, Xbox is the same thing with the achievements

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
You know, you get certain achievements

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Well, it's like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Of, like, achievements that they've earned during, like, you know, Totem Ball

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Or some shit

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
This is where I played the game for ten hours or something

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Wow, you have dedication

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
You press start

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Achievement unlocked

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Wasn't that one in the Simpsons game?

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Or Avatar

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
You hit something eight times in a row

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
One thousand points unlocked

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
There you have it

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I don't know, Jamie, are you excited about home on PlayStation 3?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Relatively

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I'm excited because it's free

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
If I had to pay for that shit, I'm not playing in home

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Free is a good thing

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Free is a very good thing, it's hard to ignore

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Oh, that is a good point

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Touche for Jamie

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
Well, there actually is a date now for Dual Shock 3

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Over here in the US

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
We're getting it on April 15th

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
For $54.99

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And I don't want that for my birthday

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
So nobody get it for me

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
But it's, I mean

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
It's basically

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
Basically, from what I can tell in here, the 6-axis with vibration, so...

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
So basically it's the controller that should have come out the first time, it's finally coming out.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Yeah, except for all the crappy legal problems they were having.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Wait, what was the price again on that?

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
That's $54.99.

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
$54 bucks for a freaking controller. But then again, Xbox is just as bad, right? Isn't it like $59 for their wireless?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
$49.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
It's the same price as their current controllers. You see, he rumbles $5 extra.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I guess...

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
That is too damn much for a controller.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
Wait, no, I actually rumble, well, tilt sensors in rumble are, you know, $5 extra.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Well, it is also wireless.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
But still...

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Yeah, the wireless controller, I don't know, it's a...

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
I don't give Xbox a pass here either, I think their controllers are way too expensive too, I think.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And then you get the Wii one, it's just as bad too.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Yeah, the Wii's bad.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Controllers are way too damn much money.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
Yeah, yeah, but I have to say something though for the Xbox 360 controllers, that the keyboard attachment is cool.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Really?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Oh yeah.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
I haven't even really played with one ever.

31:21.000 --> 31:29.000
The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the remote and nunchuck, because the remote's $40 and the nunchuck's $20, so it's $60 altogether.

31:29.000 --> 31:36.000
I don't know, I guess maybe for some reason I let Nintendo slip by a little more, and I know people want to call it fanboyism, but I don't.

31:36.000 --> 31:45.000
Here's my logic, I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price because that controller is really kind of like the core of the system and the motion and everything,

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
but I don't know, I guess one could argue that it's the same thing on the Playstation 3.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
I don't know, but the motion shit on the Playstation 3 is very kind of...

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Last minute?

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
Not really last minute, but just kind of, well, a little last minute, but just kind of useless, I think.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
I like this comment from Alpha Canagram in chat, he says,

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
Sky, wait, Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube was most expensive.

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
That's true, because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance with cable, and if you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles, you had to get four of those.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
You know we actually still kept our Game Boy Advances for that reason?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Yeah.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
So that we could play Pac-Man Versus?

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
I was going to say, I can only think of like three games that even use that feature, no, four, because Animal Crossing was one.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
And yeah, Animal Crossing, Pac-Man Versus, Crystal Chronicles, and Zelda.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Zelda.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
For sorts.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah, and that's really it, just a handful of games.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
But Pac-Man Versus is awesome.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii start to see more of that stuff, too.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Well, didn't Pac-Man Versus come out on the Namco Museum DS?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Yes, that's right.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
That's pretty cool.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
It is pretty cool.

32:48.000 --> 32:54.000
Not enough to get me to buy Namco games all over again, those classic collections that I keep re-releasing.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
Random thoughts, speaking of classic collections, that just kind of make me go, huh.

32:58.000 --> 33:05.000
I was randomly at a record store earlier this week, because I was, gasp, shock and awe, buying a CD.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
I know, I know.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
I was actually buying a CD, and this place sells video games as well, they sell used video games.

33:11.000 --> 33:20.000
And I actually saw on the play, and I was actually looking at old Genesis and Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything really cool in the retro stuff.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
It was all sports.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
It was all sports stuff.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL, so that's pretty much all they had.

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
But one thing I noticed on the PlayStation 2 was an Activision anthology, and I never even knew this game existed.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
Because the Activision releases an anthology on every system.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
You know, they had one on PlayStation 1, they've had one on the PC, I actually own the one on PC.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
They've had a ton of them.

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
I didn't realize they had one on PlayStation 2, but I just thought it was funny, because I'm reading the back of the box, like all the games that are in it.

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
And this is how they're selling the game, is that A, it talks about, you can do cool effects to the games while you're playing.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
Like, you can play Pitfall, but it's in a cube or something.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
But then the other thing, I thought it was really funny, because it lists all these games, and underneath that it says,

33:59.000 --> 34:07.000
Never before seen in an Activision compilation, Pitfall 2 and some of these other really obscure Activision games.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure, but the other ones that were listed were very obscure.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Like, Bridge. What's that?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I think I'm going to order a freeloader.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
You're going to order the Activision one? What?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
No, a freeloader.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Oh, freeloader. Oh.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Oh.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
We'll talk more about that a little later, I bet.

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
So, another person jumping from the Sony ship would be Phil Harrison.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
He's actually resigned from Sony Computer Entertainment, which is sad, because that only leaves Kaz left.

34:35.000 --> 34:43.000
And, luckily though, it's not, was it not, oh God, the crazy guy.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Ken Kutaragi.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
Ken Kutaragi, yeah. Thank God he's not the only one left piloting this boat here.

34:49.000 --> 34:55.000
But, no, that does leave Kaz. I believe there were some rumors on where he was going to go,

34:55.000 --> 35:03.000
including, you know, Atari to, I don't know why he would jump from one ship to another sinking ship, but whatever.

35:03.000 --> 35:10.000
But, sad to see him go, because he was actually kind of a voice of logic, I guess, for the company.

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
But who needs that, really?

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
I don't know. But that is weird. If it's true, he went to Atari.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
That's kind of like, I don't know, but maybe he can help fix things there. I don't know.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
That'd be nice to see them turn around.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
All right, well, you know, with all this talk about Lost Odyssey and what a great RPG it is,

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out where they were actually really amazing.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
One of them was Persona 3, and I admit, I did not get to really play much of Persona 3.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it, because apparently,

35:47.000 --> 35:54.000
Persona FES, which is an expansion to Persona 3, is actually coming out here in the U.S. on April 22,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
and it'll set you back $29.99.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
But the cool thing about it, now obviously this is a PlayStation 2 game.

35:59.000 --> 36:05.000
It's not in the current gen of consoles. It's in PlayStation 2, but obviously that's what a lot of people still have.

36:05.000 --> 36:11.000
But for such a low price, for such a huge game, you get both the enhanced version of Persona 3,

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
and new bonus features, and a new chapter that is apparently 30-plus hours.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
So this is kind of like Oblivion game of the year edition, but for Persona.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
For 30 bucks, which isn't bad.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
There's still pretty good stuff coming out on the PlayStation 2.

36:24.000 --> 36:31.000
And luckily though, a lot of the people that put out really crappy shovelware games for the PS2 have now moved to the Wii.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
So you get a pretty good crowd, although there are still some.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
But luckily though, they've adopted the price point at $14.99 retail,

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
and you know, you can't beat that, even if it does suck.

36:42.000 --> 36:50.000
Well, you can download a lot of games for five bucks, so I don't know, $14.99 still feels too expensive for me for a crap game.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
You know, Hannah Montana goes to college or whatever the hell they put out.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
What?

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
I don't know. I pulled that name out of thin air.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
You want to know what status I think that they would make that game?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
They just might. Patent pending.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Why don't you go to college? She's rich.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana or the trailer.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Well, if I were really rich, I would want to be fully educated.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
True.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
But then again, if you're, you know, a puppet of Disney, then...

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
In my mind, it's a sitcom, just like Saved by the Bell went to college at one point.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney Channel stars need to go to college at some point.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
That would have saved Brittany from her fate.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Perhaps.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Goofy goes to college.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Garsh.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Can I read the next story, please?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
You may.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
Well, Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out.

37:39.000 --> 37:47.000
It says it will be out in time for the winter holiday to be politically correct.

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
I'm so excited that they're releasing game on Festivus.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Decemberween.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Gives you something to celebrate.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
It's island themed.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
Which is so, you know, wintery.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
That might be kind of fun, though.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
I did think the first one had too much dirt.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
This one seems to have plenty of dirt, too.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
It's in the middle of a desert.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I'm sorry.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Too much dirt for you.

38:19.000 --> 38:29.000
Although, you know what, I really have to say that the artist's joystick where we got this information from are very creative.

38:29.000 --> 38:36.000
I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon, because I don't think they've done a good off-road moon racing game.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
Actually, there was Cruis'n World.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX?

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Cruis'n World had you go play on the moon.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
And then you ran into aliens that had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Thank you.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Malholus in chat.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
We have a lot of new chatters tonight.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Welcome, all you guys.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Malholus in chat says, moon patrol.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
I am straight.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
That's old school right there.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Moon patrol.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
That's all the moon game you need.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Wait.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
You know, I was just thinking, there's all these bastardized Atari games from years past.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Why didn't they ever put out a bastardized moon patrol?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
That's what I'm curious about.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Or did they?

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
And I just missed it.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
What picture am I looking for?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
The screen capture.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
They took a picture from Motorstorm and put a pond and a palm tree on it.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Made out of Microsoft Paint.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Cute.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I have to show this in the chat room, because it's hilarious.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Pretty cute.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Oh, I just thought of it.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
Hannah Montana goes to her first frat party.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Hannah Montana goes wild.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
It's inevitable.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Hannah Montana gets a podcast.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
They already do crap like that.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
It's called the Evening News.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
There you go.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Malholus again.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Hannah Montana goes to the moon.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
There it is.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Right there.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Like, two things we need, right?

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Together.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Alright.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Enough of this.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana, but it's funny.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
We do not need more Hannah Montana.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
We need less of Hannah Montana.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
What we do need more of is more colors in PS3.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
And, there is a rumor.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I was just thinking that.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
I know.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
No, I wasn't actually.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I can read minds.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
It's a skill I learned.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Okay.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
So, there is a new SKU coming out for the 48 PS3.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
I know this for a fact, because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3, the Blu-Ray.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Because, Sony thinks, you know what?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Blu-Ray is a winning format.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.500
We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.000
You will just buy your own fucking Blu-Ray movies.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
So, there is going to be a new SKU coming out.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.520
And, apparently, some Circuit City employees have begun receiving their shipments of these

40:43.520 --> 40:44.520
new PS3s.

40:44.520 --> 40:51.660
And, on the shipping box, there is a model number, which is CECHH01.

40:51.660 --> 40:58.560
And for those who may remember a while back when we covered that the FCC had an item filed

40:58.560 --> 41:04.400
from Sony regarding a white PS3 while the item numbers happened to match.

41:04.400 --> 41:10.960
So, is it going to be the white system coming out to replace the black one with the Spider-Man

41:10.960 --> 41:11.960
3?

41:11.960 --> 41:12.960
Maybe.

41:12.960 --> 41:13.960
I don't know.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.960
We'll have to see, I guess.

41:15.960 --> 41:19.520
But, if that's the case, it's going to be coming soon.

41:19.520 --> 41:24.620
Are there really people that are like, I mean, do these people really, really exist that

41:24.620 --> 41:29.540
are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3 until they release them in white?

41:29.540 --> 41:31.360
Or until they release them in red?

41:31.360 --> 41:33.200
Or what are the colors that we talked about?

41:33.200 --> 41:36.360
The silver thing that we talked about on another show in another country.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.360
I don't think that...

41:37.360 --> 41:38.360
Are there really those people?

41:38.360 --> 41:39.360
I don't think that there are.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.960
But, I mean, people may be with the DS because it's cheaper.

41:42.960 --> 41:48.440
But I don't think color is really going to, I don't know, sway you on buying the system

41:48.440 --> 41:49.440
or not.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.720
I mean, people aren't going to go, you know, it's $400.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.360
If only it were in white, I would really just make the purchase.

41:56.360 --> 42:00.200
I just need something that matches the drapes and black doesn't do it for me.

42:00.200 --> 42:03.240
I fucking hate when they come out with new system colors because then they have to come

42:03.240 --> 42:08.120
out with new accessory colors and new everything colors and it just sucks.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.200
Lots of comments in chat.

42:09.200 --> 42:14.800
Brad from Pod Culture says, Skye, I waited till Blue to get my DS.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.660
With Nintendo, though, it's inevitable that they're going to come out in other colors.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.920
That is still a little crazy.

42:19.920 --> 42:23.520
Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing, but you'll notice, whatever happened to the

42:23.520 --> 42:24.640
pink Wiis?

42:24.640 --> 42:25.640
Whatever happened to that?

42:25.640 --> 42:26.760
And the blue Wiis and the green Wiis?

42:26.760 --> 42:27.760
Whatever happened to that?

42:27.760 --> 42:29.960
They didn't need to do it, that's what, I guess.

42:29.960 --> 42:33.480
SSJ100Matt says, Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3.

42:33.480 --> 42:34.480
Damn right.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.280
I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3.

42:36.280 --> 42:39.840
That would be the best.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.920
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to join in.

42:41.920 --> 42:46.420
We do try to keep an eye on Justin.TV's chat room as well, but sometimes I have a hard

42:46.420 --> 42:48.940
time staying on top of that because that's two different chat rooms.

42:48.940 --> 42:51.280
That's a lot.

42:51.280 --> 42:56.680
Something you're going to be able to play on those white PlayStations would be lots

42:56.680 --> 43:01.320
and lots of games coming to the PlayStation Store.

43:01.320 --> 43:09.040
25 old school titles have been leaked by the European version of the PlayStation Store.

43:09.040 --> 43:13.480
Well, also, there are some pretty cool titles in there.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.240
No, there are some very cool titles in there.

43:15.240 --> 43:17.620
That's what makes me think it's probably fake.

43:17.620 --> 43:18.620
It's not fake.

43:18.620 --> 43:22.320
These are from the European version of the ESRB is where they got these titles from.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.080
Oh, I thought it was a store delete.

43:24.080 --> 43:27.600
Oh, no, it was the PEGI.

43:27.600 --> 43:28.600
I guess leaked the same region.

43:28.600 --> 43:33.360
Okay, is there a version of the, oh, I thought it was Sony that accidentally somehow made

43:33.360 --> 43:34.760
these visible for a minute.

43:34.760 --> 43:38.000
Well, then I guess it's legit and there are some cool games coming out because one of

43:38.000 --> 43:43.240
them, Bust-A-Groove, Holla!, those folks like their old school music games and stuff, very

43:43.240 --> 43:45.120
excited to hear that.

43:45.120 --> 43:51.440
Crash Bandicoot 3, Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3, Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies,

43:51.440 --> 43:58.140
Everybody's Golf, Klona, Klonoa, Klonoa's like the best game ever, Kurushi Final, Motor

43:58.140 --> 44:04.080
Tune Grand Prix, Namco Museum 1, 2, and 4, I don't know what happened to 3, Omega Boost,

44:04.080 --> 44:11.320
Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4, Rollcage, Spyro, Tekken 2, 3, Twisted Metal, Vib ribbon,

44:11.320 --> 44:14.520
Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097, lots of stuff.

44:14.520 --> 44:15.520
Vib ribbon.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.520
That's pretty awesome.

44:16.520 --> 44:17.520
That is pretty awesome.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.520
That game is crack.

44:19.520 --> 44:24.960
And actually, I don't know if a lot of people remember, Colony Wars is actually pretty decent

44:24.960 --> 44:28.920
as far as the space shooter goes, same with Cool Borders, that's pretty fun.

44:28.920 --> 44:29.920
Omega Boost is awesome.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.320
Son of Dad says, Intelligent Cube, please.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.320
There you go.

44:33.320 --> 44:36.520
He said, don't they have the PSP one, didn't they come out with like a sequel-ish thing

44:36.520 --> 44:37.520
to that game?

44:37.520 --> 44:38.520
Yeah, they have a couple of them.

44:38.520 --> 44:43.600
And let's see, Crunky Boy Jr. in chat says, I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared

44:43.600 --> 44:44.600
it right up.

44:44.600 --> 44:51.000
Hey, Klonoa was a great game, but it was messed up at the end.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Nice.

44:55.000 --> 45:01.080
So, in other bundling news, in Europe, they're going to get a pretty decent bundle, I'm going

45:01.080 --> 45:07.760
to say, that is the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle.

45:07.760 --> 45:18.160
And it's a 40 gigabyte PS3, I'm sorry, my apologies, 80 gigabyte, oh, sorry, they're

45:18.160 --> 45:21.120
doing two of them, my apologies.

45:21.120 --> 45:26.160
I was just staring at the red box because it's, well, kind of red and black and very

45:26.160 --> 45:30.400
cool colored, and it's got a silver car up on the front of it, I can't see what it is

45:30.400 --> 45:42.520
though, but they're saying that it's going to be out on, looks like March 29th and retails

45:42.520 --> 45:49.120
for 3.99 euro, so that's pretty cool.

45:49.120 --> 45:52.000
I love all this hubba loo over prologue.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
It's not even the actual game, it's just prologue.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.600
But to be honest, I think this game's going to hurt their sales for the full game.

45:58.600 --> 45:59.600
You think?

45:59.600 --> 46:05.880
Well, for people, if I had to buy a Gran Turismo game, I don't think I'd buy the full one because

46:05.880 --> 46:11.940
I don't race 200 cars, there's only a few cars that actually probably race, and after

46:11.940 --> 46:17.120
I play this game, prologue, for however many months until the full game comes out, I'll

46:17.120 --> 46:18.120
probably be sick of it.

46:18.120 --> 46:22.960
I'll just be like, okay, whatever, I'm done, I'm not going to spend another $50 or whatever

46:22.960 --> 46:27.200
to upgrade to have more cars.

46:27.200 --> 46:33.480
Now the smart thing to do would be to release the retail version of Gran Turismo 5 and release

46:33.480 --> 46:38.700
a $20 update that would give you all the additional cars and tracks.

46:38.700 --> 46:39.700
That would never happen though.

46:39.700 --> 46:44.320
RossdielUT in chat says, Loki, Gran Turismo isn't for you, it's for crazed car freaks.

46:44.320 --> 46:46.040
There's another bundle listed on here too.

46:46.040 --> 46:47.040
What's that?

46:47.040 --> 46:55.560
A Blu-ray bundle, the 40 gigabyte PS3 with Spiderman 300 and Casino Royale on March 19th.

46:55.560 --> 47:01.480
Now that's reasonable, because obviously now that Blu-ray has officially won or whatever,

47:01.480 --> 47:03.400
that's totally understandable.

47:03.400 --> 47:06.480
There's a lot of people that are going to buy PlayStation 3s just because it plays Blu-rays

47:06.480 --> 47:07.560
and games.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.440
You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people to do that?

47:09.440 --> 47:11.600
Because that's how PlayStation 2 won.

47:11.600 --> 47:16.040
Hey, I bought my PlayStation 2, well actually no, I didn't buy it as a DVD player, I just

47:16.040 --> 47:19.840
bought it because Armored Core was coming out on it, and I love me some Armored Core.

47:19.840 --> 47:24.300
Except I didn't buy Armored Core 4, whatever.

47:24.300 --> 47:29.040
I liked what Akdeft in chat says too, Akdeft says, Gran Turismo 5 prologue, Gran Turismo

47:29.040 --> 47:35.480
5 introduction, Gran Turismo 5, and then Gran Turismo 5 epilogue.

47:35.480 --> 47:38.320
And yet, no Gran Turismo portable for the PSP.

47:38.320 --> 47:42.880
It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series, it's like Final Fantasy VII games now at some

47:42.880 --> 47:44.680
point.

47:44.680 --> 47:49.920
And they'll have Final Fantasy prologue with cars.

47:49.920 --> 47:50.920
Gran Turismo.

47:50.920 --> 47:56.720
There's different kinds of chocobos.

47:56.720 --> 47:59.400
You get to try out different chocobos.

47:59.400 --> 48:03.600
You may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5, there are plenty of other games to get your attention

48:03.600 --> 48:05.360
this week.

48:05.360 --> 48:10.880
Starting things off, we have Bully Scholarship Edition coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360.

48:10.880 --> 48:15.240
Slightly better than the PlayStation 2 version because it has slightly better graphics and

48:15.240 --> 48:18.440
a few more missions.

48:18.440 --> 48:23.680
The game I teased last week, Let's Ride Friends Forever, coming out on the DS.

48:23.680 --> 48:26.360
Worst name ever.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.360
If you're into baseball.

48:27.360 --> 48:31.000
Or most unintentionally funny name ever, depending on how you look at it.

48:31.000 --> 48:36.800
There's going to be two games for you, Sony's MLB 08 The Show, and that's coming on PlayStation

48:36.800 --> 48:38.960
2, PlayStation 3, and PSP.

48:38.960 --> 48:46.740
And then MLB 2K8 coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360.

48:46.740 --> 48:51.840
We have Army of Two coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.720
Chicken Hunter on the DS.

48:53.720 --> 48:57.680
It's a stupid game where you kill chickens.

48:57.680 --> 48:59.400
So it's not just a clever name.

48:59.400 --> 49:02.160
No, it's very literal.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.440
And imagine Figure Skater.

49:04.440 --> 49:09.880
It is a game where you are a figure skater and you get to do little gay ass moves.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.600
Yay, figure skater.

49:11.600 --> 49:15.040
I'm almost offended by that comment.

49:15.040 --> 49:17.680
I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to figure skater ever again.

49:17.680 --> 49:18.680
Yeah, exactly.

49:18.680 --> 49:22.760
Let's see what else we have here.

49:22.760 --> 49:30.000
Also Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC, awesome.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.840
Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week.

49:33.840 --> 49:41.520
God of War Chains of Olympus coming out on the PSP, that looks pretty awesome.

49:41.520 --> 49:48.200
Pets Bunnies for the DS, yes you two can raise bunnies now, hooray.

49:48.200 --> 49:54.680
Let's see, just a small little game called Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii.

49:54.680 --> 49:58.400
That will be coming out a week from today, hooray.

49:58.400 --> 50:04.360
Ninja Reflex is coming out on the Wii and the DS this week for your Ninja themed party

50:04.360 --> 50:05.800
games.

50:05.800 --> 50:12.000
World Championship Cards for the PSP, in case you want to play something other than poker.

50:12.000 --> 50:18.120
Mystery Dungeon Sheeran the Wanderer coming out on the DS.

50:18.120 --> 50:27.640
Let's see, we've also got Spitfire Heroes Tales of the Royal Air Force, that's on DS

50:27.640 --> 50:29.200
as well.

50:29.200 --> 50:32.320
And Homies Rollers on the DS.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.560
You like Homies the Clown?

50:33.560 --> 50:39.040
That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures they can get out of those machines

50:39.040 --> 50:40.040
for 10 cents or 25 cents.

50:40.040 --> 50:43.640
Oh, my boss used to collect those.

50:43.640 --> 50:48.600
The uh, let's see, I believe that's it.

50:48.600 --> 50:52.560
Smash Brothers Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week.

50:52.560 --> 50:56.100
I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance, but maybe

50:56.100 --> 50:58.360
there's a certain audience for that, I don't know.

50:58.360 --> 51:00.080
I will tell you what.

51:00.080 --> 51:02.180
Uh oh, what?

51:02.180 --> 51:04.960
Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies.

51:04.960 --> 51:09.240
Oh no, oh here we go, here we go, okay, yes, yes, if Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a

51:09.240 --> 51:11.360
million copies, yes, what?

51:11.360 --> 51:14.400
We'll do the whole tingle thing and we'll burn Eye of Judgment.

51:14.400 --> 51:18.120
We'll need another game in there, just, you know, more of a chance.

51:18.120 --> 51:21.040
You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?

51:21.040 --> 51:22.040
Yeah.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.040
Great.

51:23.040 --> 51:27.240
The makers of that game just thanked you for selling like, you know, about 100 additional

51:27.240 --> 51:28.560
copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.040
Here, I'll make it even more fair.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.480
The combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever...

51:32.480 --> 51:37.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, so the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment

51:37.400 --> 51:38.400
now?

51:38.400 --> 51:39.400
Yes.

51:39.400 --> 51:40.400
Oh, mark...

51:40.400 --> 51:42.760
Because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell 100,000 copies.

51:42.760 --> 51:48.120
Somebody mark the date and time of this, oh, it's almost exactly 7 o'clock here on Sunday

51:48.120 --> 51:49.120
evening, March 2nd.

51:49.120 --> 51:51.440
It will never sell anything, okay, come on.

51:51.440 --> 51:55.720
Well that's, that's something, that's giving the listeners, that's for the little meter

51:55.720 --> 51:59.580
some of the chatters made up, some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that

51:59.580 --> 52:02.880
looks like a telethon thing, and it's like the road to 1 million copies.

52:02.880 --> 52:03.880
It'll never happen.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.400
Now it gives them something to add to that.

52:06.400 --> 52:10.000
It'll never, ever happen.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.600
Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never, ever sell.

52:12.600 --> 52:16.460
Here's the thing, here's the thing, chat room, you gotta get him to keep adding games to

52:16.460 --> 52:21.560
it until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total.

52:21.560 --> 52:26.560
Oh yeah, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that.

52:26.560 --> 52:30.120
Joel Banjo says another one for the OLR wiki, I forgot to mention Housekeeping, this would

52:30.120 --> 52:31.120
have been good.

52:31.120 --> 52:37.120
They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio, and you can wiki stuff on it, even though

52:37.120 --> 52:43.120
I guess, well we have an official Wikipedia article, but now we have our own freaking

52:43.120 --> 52:49.360
entire wiki, which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really, you'd think I wrote

52:49.360 --> 52:54.700
it or Loki wrote that article, but we've never really worked on that, it was totally the

52:54.700 --> 52:57.200
fans that did that, so that was really cool.

52:57.200 --> 52:58.200
And uh...

52:58.200 --> 52:59.640
I haven't even seen it.

52:59.640 --> 53:00.640
On Wikipedia?

53:00.640 --> 53:04.200
Oh, well I thought you meant, oh you meant on Wikipedia, I thought you meant like a...

53:04.200 --> 53:05.640
Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.760
A wiki set up for us.

53:06.760 --> 53:10.200
Yes, but now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki, and you can...

53:10.200 --> 53:11.200
That's what I was talking about.

53:11.200 --> 53:16.880
Yes, that, well I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out, it's orangeloungeradio.wikia,

53:16.880 --> 53:22.200
that's W-I-K-I-A dot com, so check it out, and somebody just linked it in chat as well,

53:22.200 --> 53:23.200
so check that out.

53:23.200 --> 53:27.280
Alright, meanwhile, let's go back to traveling the globe and looking at upcoming releases,

53:27.280 --> 53:30.560
and we'll start on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

53:30.560 --> 53:34.280
You get a new version of the console coming out, the Xbox 360 Arcade hits Japan, and with

53:34.280 --> 53:39.340
that comes some price reductions, yay, including Riot Act, which you might know as Crackdown,

53:39.340 --> 53:44.840
and Saints Row gets some price reductions this week on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

53:44.840 --> 53:49.560
Coming out on the Playstation 3, the DualShock 3 makes its way out there, as well as Guitar

53:49.560 --> 53:54.880
Hero 3, Legends of Rock finally comes out in Japan, the Satin Silver, that's what I

53:54.880 --> 54:01.400
was trying to think of earlier, the Satin Silver Playstation 3 comes out as well.

54:01.400 --> 54:08.080
Continuing our trip in Japan on the Nintendo Wii, Family Jockey comes out in Japan, also

54:08.080 --> 54:12.960
Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, I did not realize this game had quite the delay between the

54:12.960 --> 54:18.520
US and Japan, but it is finally coming out in Japan this week, so I guess we're not the

54:18.520 --> 54:21.520
only ones that have to wait for big titles sometimes, it looks like Japan had to wait

54:21.520 --> 54:24.720
for this one, that's kind of surprised me, and I look to see if it's a price reduction

54:24.720 --> 54:27.360
or something like that, it's not, it's full price, so this must be the first time they're

54:27.360 --> 54:30.920
getting that, so that kind of surprised me.

54:30.920 --> 54:34.960
Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin, and it comes with a-

54:34.960 --> 54:36.560
Nobunaga's ambition something.

54:36.560 --> 54:37.560
I don't-

54:37.560 --> 54:38.560
Online, I think.

54:38.560 --> 54:42.960
Well, it comes with what's called a power-up kit, and I'm not exactly sure what a power-up

54:42.960 --> 54:47.000
kit has in it, so this is something they haven't released yet.

54:47.000 --> 54:52.200
Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games, same thing with Double Kings or whatever they call

54:52.200 --> 54:54.320
that over there.

54:54.320 --> 54:57.920
I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes.

54:57.920 --> 54:58.920
It's drugs.

54:58.920 --> 55:02.040
Perhaps, but it does look like another version of Nobunaga's ambition, dang, the last time

55:02.040 --> 55:06.600
I played this game was on the NES, and look how far it's come, it's like Civilization,

55:06.600 --> 55:09.040
I remember Civ 1, I have such fond memories of that game.

55:09.040 --> 55:14.840
And I had a Nobunaga's ambition game that came out the beginning of February for PlayStation

55:14.840 --> 55:15.840
2.

55:15.840 --> 55:20.320
Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore, they're too complicated for me, I'm not smart

55:20.320 --> 55:22.440
enough to play those games, I'll admit it.

55:22.440 --> 55:25.240
I think that's just exactly what it boils down to.

55:25.240 --> 55:26.240
They're too much for me now.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.240
They get too complicated.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.960
They need a Nobunaga's ambition party game.

55:29.960 --> 55:34.800
Yeah, they need like, you know how they dumb down Madden for Wii owners?

55:34.800 --> 55:37.240
That's what I need, I need a dumbed-down version of Nobunaga's ambition.

55:37.240 --> 55:42.160
Swing the remote down to conquer Japan.

55:42.160 --> 55:44.320
It's too bad they don't have achievement points.

55:44.320 --> 55:48.520
And I accidentally closed out my list, so I'll tell you what, why don't we go to Europe

55:48.520 --> 55:49.520
and then we'll come back to Japan?

55:49.520 --> 55:52.460
Well, you know what that actually makes me think, did we ever get a current-gen release

55:52.460 --> 55:55.200
of Risk?

55:55.200 --> 55:56.200
Not that I can think of.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.200
But wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?

55:58.200 --> 56:01.360
It'd be cool if we had Risk and Access and Allies, wouldn't that be cool?

56:01.360 --> 56:03.840
That would be very cool.

56:03.840 --> 56:04.840
I love games like that.

56:04.840 --> 56:07.720
Oh wait, I got the Japanese release dates back, never mind.

56:07.720 --> 56:08.720
Fine.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.840
Europe can wait a little longer, they're used to it.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.840
That was me!

56:12.840 --> 56:15.680
It was, below the bell, I'm sorry, party foul.

56:15.680 --> 56:18.760
Dear European listeners, please send Rob a smack in the head via email.

56:18.760 --> 56:21.280
Send me your cards and letters.

56:21.280 --> 56:24.200
Whatever, they get Mario Kart early.

56:24.200 --> 56:25.200
Yeah, that's right.

56:25.200 --> 56:27.300
So you know, shut up.

56:27.300 --> 56:29.280
Go stuff yourself with a crumpet.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.280
Hey!

56:30.280 --> 56:38.320
I love Britain, I love all of Europe, I love France, I love Spain, I love them all.

56:38.320 --> 56:39.320
Alright.

56:39.320 --> 56:44.560
On the PlayStation 2, also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well.

56:44.560 --> 56:51.320
And guess what, as if there wasn't enough Pachinko in your life, Hisu Pachinko Pachi

56:51.320 --> 56:55.320
Slot Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well.

56:55.320 --> 57:00.240
By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of Pachinko,

57:00.240 --> 57:04.200
because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that.

57:04.200 --> 57:11.560
On the Nintendo DS, Bomberman gets a price cut, Doraemon no Bita Ton Midori no Kyojinden

57:11.560 --> 57:12.960
DS comes out.

57:12.960 --> 57:16.480
In other words, it's Doraemon on the DS yet again.

57:16.480 --> 57:21.560
And lastly on the PSP, and then I promise we can do the Europe dates, Dragon Quest and

57:21.560 --> 57:27.160
Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable, that is a combo kit of those games.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.560
It's like an Ultimate Hits.

57:28.560 --> 57:29.560
So there you have it.

57:29.560 --> 57:32.580
And also, Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits.

57:32.580 --> 57:37.600
The Lenneth and what was the other one, Slo-Mera or whatever it was called, they both move

57:37.600 --> 57:40.160
into the Greatest Hits collection.

57:40.160 --> 57:46.560
Alright, now that all of Britain hates me, and Europe in general, let's go to their release

57:46.560 --> 57:48.560
dates, shall we, Jamie?

57:48.560 --> 57:49.560
Fine.

57:49.560 --> 57:54.160
Well these are all on the 7th, and one of them pisses me off, but I have a certain bias

57:54.160 --> 57:55.800
against it.

57:55.800 --> 58:02.560
Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Blacksite Area 51 on PS3, Bully's

58:02.560 --> 58:08.840
Scholarship Edition, Xbox 360 and Wii, Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed on Wii, Dynasty

58:08.840 --> 58:18.360
Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Jack Keane on PC, MX vs ATV Untamed on a bunch of crap,

58:18.360 --> 58:24.720
Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one, The Destiny of Zorro on Wii, Victorious Boxers

58:24.720 --> 58:29.720
on Wii, and the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K Dawn of War.

58:29.720 --> 58:32.320
Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?

58:32.320 --> 58:33.320
Yes.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.320
Oh, Victorious.

58:34.320 --> 58:38.200
I thought you said Victorias, and I'm thinking like, is that like Victoria's Closet for Men?

58:38.200 --> 58:39.200
Like now they're expanding?

58:39.200 --> 58:40.680
I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls.

58:40.680 --> 58:43.200
You mean Victoria's Secret?

58:43.200 --> 58:44.200
She has a penis?

58:44.200 --> 58:46.040
No, I thought you said Victoria's Closet.

58:46.040 --> 58:47.040
Oh, maybe I did.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.640
That was a really crappy show.

58:48.640 --> 58:51.040
That was Veronica's Closet, it was Chrissy Alley.

58:51.040 --> 58:56.400
No, Victoria's Secret, I thought I heard her say Victoria's Boxers.

58:56.400 --> 59:00.240
Maybe my mind is just focused on underwear right now, I don't know.

59:00.240 --> 59:04.480
See, you said Victoria's, though, and I was thinking that you were bringing up Spice

59:04.480 --> 59:06.480
Girls.

59:06.480 --> 59:12.200
They're a pair of boxers, and on the back of them is a big peace sign, you know, like

59:12.200 --> 59:15.120
the V for victory or whatever.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.120
A hand doing a V.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.120
Please let's change the topic.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.680
I hate Warhammer 40K.

59:21.680 --> 59:23.240
Why?

59:23.240 --> 59:27.460
Because I had an ex who did nothing but play Warhammer 40K and paint his retarded little

59:27.460 --> 59:31.480
models on end for days at a time.

59:31.480 --> 59:35.240
I tried painting those once, and then I saw that they were six millimeters tall, and I'm

59:35.240 --> 59:36.240
like, fuck this.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.920
I am not doing this.

59:37.920 --> 59:42.880
And I'm a big gamer, I love gaming, but there just comes a point where there's this weird

59:42.880 --> 59:48.880
obsession with the little figures and for building terrain from scratch, and that's

59:48.880 --> 59:52.880
all he ever did, so yeah, I broke up with him to play with, you know, to hang out with

59:52.880 --> 59:54.120
some guy that played Rifts.

59:54.120 --> 59:59.320
It was fun, though, running over those little figurines with a toy train, because, you know,

59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.640
if you're going to build your own landscape, you might as well already have a train set

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.920
and landscape built already for that.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.520
Well, I can understand having a project, that's one thing, but when your entire life is your

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.600
project, that's a little something else.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.440
That and you didn't have a job.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440
Yeah.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:18.400
Speaking about building little figurines, Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spinoffs

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.880
for different games, including Indiana Jones and Star Wars.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.480
Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:31.360
As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue, but they have screenshots to

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.640
prove that it's real, you know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts, but sure, if you

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.640
want to believe...

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:44.280
The minute I saw a headline that said, April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was,

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.000
I was like, oh, haha, funny, April Fools joke.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I hate April Fools.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
You know...

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.420
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.240
It would be cool if it were real, I don't think it is, and I don't think you would try

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.240
to...

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.240
It's not, come on.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.360
You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine, you know, and of course

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.680
it's their exclusive, they say, and stuff like that.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:09.600
Trust me, if this was a real exclusive, 1up.com would be whoring the shit out of this right

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:16.160
now, okay, because they like to tease their exclusives, so, whatever.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.440
You don't need any more Halo or Lego Halo.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.360
Well, I almost thought this was a joke when I first read about it too, but no, it is true,

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.320
and it's one of the more interesting types of development in gaming I've heard in a long

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.320
time.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.320
Okay, here's the thing.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.760
You know Treasure made a shooter years ago called Bangayo?

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.760
Bangayo!

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.760
Okay, well, here's...

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.760
Isn't that a classic game?

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.360
Yeah, well, that's right, it's coming out on the DS, right, as Bangayo Spirits, okay?

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.820
That's not the part I thought was a joke.

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:45.800
Here's the part I thought was a joke.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:51.720
It uses what's called sound load, and what you do, you share custom levels, high scores

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:57.400
and replay videos, but you don't do it using the built-in Wi-Fi or any of that, no, no,

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.960
it's sound.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.880
That's right, because the DS has a microphone and a speaker, I guess you put the DSs really

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:08.260
close to each other, and what happens is that the data is turned into noises and sound,

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:12.840
and it's played out the speaker of your DS, and then your friend picks it up on his microphone

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.600
or his or her microphone DS, and turned back into game data.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.120
What a weird concept.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:23.080
And the other thing you can do with this is you can put them in MP3 format or whatever

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.560
and spread them out on the internet, so people can download them that way.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.880
It's Treasure.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.120
It's kind of neat, I'll admit, but I totally, when I first read this, I'm like, this is

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.360
the weirdest thing I've ever heard, but yeah, and then I'm thinking like, wow, we could

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.520
like put a custom level on our podcast and be like, okay, Bangayo owners, turn on your,

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.200
you know, and that's probably exactly what they want, which is why this feature is in

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.200
there, but.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.920
Let's do that, because everybody loves listening to the sound of a modem when you pick it up.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.560
Or if you put a CD in a, or if you put an old CD-ROM in a regular CD player and you

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.560
hear that.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.520
No, it was like, did you ever put in the Symphony of the Night CD and then listen to the hidden

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.520
track?

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.520
Yeah, but the thing about PlayStation, yes, I have done that, but the thing about PlayStation

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.320
discs is for whatever reason, I don't know if this is the coding or whatever, but if

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.400
you try to play track one on a PlayStation disc, it's silence.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.980
You won't hear the noise that you will in like an old school, like go find yourself

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:22.000
a copy of Encarta and put it in a regular CD player, and if you know what I'm talking

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.600
about in your old school, because we did this in junior high, we would take a copy of Encarta

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.360
and put it in a regular CD player, and it makes the most hideous noise, and what you

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:33.100
do is, it was like the dumbass joke you would play is that you would turn the radio thing

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:39.200
up full blast, close the door, and run.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.440
I guess.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:48.720
I just remember putting them in, especially, they'd also do it on a PC Engine Duo disc

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.520
and say, this is a game disc, do not listen to this or your speakers will die.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.880
That type of thing.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:03.120
Very interesting feature, I have to admit, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.760
to go run out and buy or even really check out just because there's too many other games

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.700
on the table, right, but now I'm kind of like, I might have to look at this game just for

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:11.700
this feature.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.360
I'll tell you in one word why I'm getting this game.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360
Why?

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.360
Treasure!

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.920
I should have known.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920
Treasure!

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.280
There's always one still looking for Chameleon Twist.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.800
Alright, well, let's move on, that's all I have to say until the game comes out.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:33.000
Well, I know that quite a number of our listeners are into Rock Band, so something that everyone

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.600
should be happy about is that there is a Grateful Dead pack coming out for a Rock Band that

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:45.680
will have China Cat Sunflower, Casey Jones, Sugar Magnolia, Trucken, Franklin's Tower,

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.560
and I Need A Miracle.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.120
I think that that's pretty cool because Grateful Dead is pretty cool.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.840
Now I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit because that would be the full

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.440
dead experience right there.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.840
You know what?

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.120
You laugh about that.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.440
Apparently, okay, one of my customers, no, no, no, no, no, not about the weed thing.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:09.960
No, one of my customers actually saw the kit set up at one of the GameStop's, I guess,

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:18.360
in Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from, and it was actually pretty funny.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.000
He said it just looks like a fog machine with lights, and the lights basically hook up to

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
your sound.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.800
They're all sound activated, like, you know, your sound out or whatever your stereo system,

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.560
and they react to the sound that you do.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.560
So we could do the show, and it would react to our speaking and stuff.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560
Just what we need.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.960
Well, there's a little bit more to this story.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:45.480
For people who are not so Rock Band oriented and are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented, actually

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:51.920
no doubt having some releases on there, which no doubt cool, Gwen Stefani's solo bad because

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.720
she sucks.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.280
That and she's got mental problems, but moving on.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.640
Wow, tell us what you really think.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:00.080
What songs are coming out from No Doubt, do we know?

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.680
Don't Speak, Excuse Me Mister, and Sunday Morning.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.800
So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.800
That's the song I love.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:12.200
No, no Just a Girl, no Spiderwebs, but I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list,

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.400
so I'm happy.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.400
What song is that?

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.400
Don't Speak.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.400
Don't Speak.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.360
All right, let's hear some clips of these songs that are coming to Rock Band very soon.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.080
Here's a clip of the Grateful Dead, so if you got them, smoke them.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.080
Just kidding, that's bad.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:49.320
Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in Rock Band, and then we have coming to Guitar

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:54.880
Hero 3, we have No Doubt, and I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak, so let's play one

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.880
of the more lesser known songs, which would be Sunday Morning.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:21.400
At least I'm glad it breathes some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band in general.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:26.040
Rock Band and the Wheels keep on turnin' with that game.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.280
Proud Mary keep on burnin', I don't know.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.280
Not yet.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.280
Maybe some day.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.280
Anyhow.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:39.000
And not to be outdone, from the studio that brings you Hannah Montana, Disney has announced

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.640
a brand new game for the Wii.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.920
Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920
No!

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.880
It's Ultimate Band!

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.680
Fuck this Rock Band shit, it's the Ultimate Band.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.800
And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:58.000
One thing, though, that you will be happy to know, and maybe this might be a sad thing,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.760
is that there will not be any peripherals for this game, it'll be all with the Wii Remote

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:02.760
and Nunchuk.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.360
So you have to imagine how you're gonna actually play these songs.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:10.840
They have a screenshot that shows apparently the guitar portion of the game, which looks

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:15.360
like it's gonna use the two buttons on the Nunchuk as your fret button.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.240
So you have two fret buttons.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.600
You have one, two, zero, or both.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.420
This sounds like Ultimate Suck.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:27.160
You know what, I'm gonna say something pretty daring here.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.040
I think this actually isn't a bad idea.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.780
Because think about who this game is aimed at.

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:36.260
It's aimed at kids, and parents don't want to spend all this frickin' money on all these

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.660
peripherals that their kids are gonna destroy.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:44.620
So you know what, if you've got a Wii, why not come out with a game that's very similar

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.280
to Rock Band, but that you don't have to buy all this extra shit for?

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.180
And of course I'm not gonna like it, probably Jamie, Matt, they're not gonna like it.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.720
It's not really made for us, it's a kid's game.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:59.560
I'll try it, but you know, I don't think I'd buy this game, but I'll try it.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:05.460
It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays, and the DS version will have that

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:10.120
brand new dgamer online social network, which is sounding pretty awesome, and I really kind

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.080
of want to check it out, but that means I have to buy a Disney DS game, and I don't

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.080
know.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:23.520
ActDeft in chat says, Sky speaks the truth, and GS68 says, Sky is right, ego plus plus.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.240
The chat room actually just reminded me of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.240
week.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.240
What's that?

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.240
Oh, I bought Parappa.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.240
Oh, rad.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.240
For $15.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.240
Nice.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.920
At a Hollywood going out of business.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.000
Let's see, RossTealUT says, Sky, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
flames will disagree.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Yeah, well, he's a freak.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.240
Hey, did I just call a seven-year-old a freak?

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.240
Cool.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.360
That's fine, he's a freak.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.360
Uni in chat says, Kids already nom-nomed the hell out of the Wii remote.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:57.760
Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii remote and hid it under the couch.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.920
If your seven-year-old nom-noms the Wii remote and hides it under the couch, you got issues.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.840
I like that phrase, that's funny.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.840
What, nom-nom?

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840
Nom-nom.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.880
Didn't you hear, everything is Caturday now.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880
Everything.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.000
Low cat speak.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.240
Cronky Boy Jr. tries to put out a zinger here saying, You mean we save money on Wii peripherals?

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.240
But I'm bummed.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.240
Get it?

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.240
Because the remotes are so fucking expensive.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.680
They don't really have real Wii peripherals.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.240
I mean, after all, there's like, what, the classic controller and the nunchuck.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.440
That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.040
Everything else is plastic shit.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.120
All right.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.840
Well, you know, a lot of folks are very excited about this.

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.200
I'm sure Mo, remember Mo from a couple weeks ago?

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.200
Yes.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.800
I'm sure she's very excited about this.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.000
Still Alive is going to be coming to Rock Band.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.520
And Valve threw a little party at Game Developers Conference, and get this, some guy actually

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.520
tried to steal the song.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.480
Okay, here's how it worked, is that Jonathan Coulton was up on stage with his band, they

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:02.200
were playing Still Alive, but in Rock Band, because apparently he didn't get 100% on vocals,

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.640
which is ironically hilarious, but whatever.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:11.100
So they finish, crowd is cheering, and what happens is that this guy from the crowd gets

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:16.420
up on stage, walks over to the 360, pulls out a memory card, which I don't know who

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:18.680
carries 360 memory cards with him on the go.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.240
I mean, back in the day, I used to carry a PlayStation memory card when I go to the arcade

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.600
and stuff, or, you know, because DDR machines had the memory card slots.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.720
They have two or three of those.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.040
I can't think of any reason why you would put like a 360 card in your pocket everywhere

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.040
you go.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.880
You go to this Game Developers Conference, whatever.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.600
So he pulls out this memory card, he puts it in, messes around, and then finally, one

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.280
of the harmonious guys walks over and says, what's going on, and this guy says, I'm just

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.880
grabbing Still Alive, everyone needs to be able to play this.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:49.240
Well, the developer, you know, took it back and deleted the thing off the card, and you

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.240
know, all is well.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.880
Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway, because it was probably a dev

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.640
360, and I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.240
It wouldn't have worked anyways because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management,

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.080
which we'll get into later, but...

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.080
Right.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.640
Well, apparently, the guy actually wrote about it.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.880
The only reason I'm not giving this Idiot of the Week award, or Stupid Guy of the Week,

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.600
or whatever we're calling it here, award, is because apparently the guy wrote about

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.760
it in his LiveJournal, and I don't know, don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.280
It could be fanfic or some shit, I don't know, but I think it's legit.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:30.080
You can check it out on his LiveJournal, it's algorithmancy.livejournal.com, that's A-L-G-O-R-I-D.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:35.760
I-T-A-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com, and he writes in this entry on February 21st, 2008.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.000
He writes his side of the story, and he puts a disclaimer at the end, he says, don't try

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
this at home.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.780
The only reason I did, because I am an acquaintance of Alex, who works at Harmonix, as well as

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:49.160
good friends with several Harmonix folks, and game industry friends give each other

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.060
free swag all the time, remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:56.060
is theft.

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:57.480
You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.480
Huh?

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.480
He's got a cool LiveJournal name, that's it.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.280
It was kind of a dumb thing to do, but at least he admits it was a little...

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.960
It was a lot of a dumb thing to do.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.400
At least he kind of admits in his LiveJournal thing, though, that it was a lot of dumb,

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:15.040
so you know, I'm not going to stupid award him when he begs for mercy.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.040
Is that...

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.520
That's what you get when you drink lots of alcohols.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.520
Exactly.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:22.800
Alcohol bad, but still alive good.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.560
Alright, before we wrap up...

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.560
Huh, what's that?

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.040
I said quite.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.920
Before we wrap up, are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in the studio?

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:30.920
No.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.920
Did you hear our idea?

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.360
I don't remember if this is the week you were gone, because February was all fucked up,

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.920
but were you here the week we had the idea that when it comes out, we'll get Mo back,

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.040
and she'll be our vocalist, and we'll get Matt to play drums, you can play guitar, you

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.240
and I can work out the guitar somehow, and we'll have an OLR band, and we'll do our rendition.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.240
Was it last week?

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.240
I can't remember.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.560
I'm getting old, and the weeks blend together.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.560
That's okay, Rob.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.560
Anyhow...

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.120
No, I'm still bringing you your birthday present.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.120
Sweet.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.360
Alright, speaking of getting old, the older we get, the more we reminisce about the classic

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:06.360
games, and that's why we like to pay tribute to the Classic Game of the Week every week.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.520
Dark Sakura likes to respect her elders in the gaming world by paying tribute to old

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:18.280
classic games, so let's dust off a dusty game and see what Dark Sakura's picked for this

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.600
week's Classic Game of the Week.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600
What is it?

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:26.880
This is actually one of my favorite arcade games ever, and I have it on Saturn, is Cybertroopers

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:37.040
Virtual On, which is a 3D robot fighting game done from a behind-the-view of your own character

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.380
who you're playing.

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.840
Let's take a listen.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:50.560
This is actually my favorite game of the week too, which is why I picked that, and almost

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.920
every other sample of it online was horrible.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:15:01.640
So, moving forward, you basically play as a virtualoid, you know, a giant robot controlled

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:08.160
by a person, which is actually pretty funny because there are little insert things where

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.000
the pilots go in the back of the month for Saturn, and the sequel, Virtual On, or Tario

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.280
Tangrum, was a dreamcast, which I have that game too, and I thought that was cool.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:25.400
You would play as a number of different specialties, like you have the Temjin, which is the balanced

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:35.360
one, you have the Raiden, which is a heavy battle, one really strong and heavily armed,

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:45.160
you have the Ampharm, which is one of the fast ones, it uses a tonko weapon, you have

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:54.240
the Belgor, which is a missile launcher, the Dorcas, which is another pretty heavy one,

01:15:54.240 --> 01:16:00.920
the Viper 2, the Basbalbo, and my favorite, which is the Fayen, which is like the cute

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:06.040
squirrel, the Kometa, which is really fast and nice, you have the Zeegratt, and then

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:12.520
you have the Jaguarade, which is, as far as I remember, I think it was one of the hidden

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:13.520
ones.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.720
But in the arcade, you had a 2% set up, and it had a dividing wall in between, so you

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:25.840
were like in the cockpit, and it used two sticks to control it, and on Saturn they did

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:31.040
release the twin sticks, and I actually don't have them, which makes me very upset because

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:37.560
I had a chance to get them, they did do an oratorio tangram that was on the Dreamcast,

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:43.040
I actually do have the twin sticks for that, in fact, you remember your ex-roommate?

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.960
We beat him getting them.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:58.720
We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento, and the guy who sold it to

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:09.000
us ended up being, I do believe, Mo's manager.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.200
You know, I know, we're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.040
But at any rate, we came in, we saw the twin sticks for 45 bucks, which was astounding

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:23.200
at that time, and like, we want to buy these right now, and I was like, okay.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:32.040
And then a person who's, as far as I knew, his nickname came from this game, came in

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.080
and we beat him by like 10 minutes.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.340
So there were also other versions, there was Cyber Troopers Virtual on Force that was only

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:47.520
in Japanese arcades in 2001, and Virtual on Mars, which was the PS2 release, so.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.000
There's also an audio drama for it, which is kind of funny.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.720
And then there was a musical one, which was the Fei-Yen robot singing, I actually have

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.200
a Fei-Yen garage kit that I still have yet to put together that I bought like six years

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.200
ago.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.200
Nice.

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.040
Virtual on's like, tops.

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:11.360
All right, well, that's going to do it, your classic game of the week, Virtual on, here

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.560
on Orange Lawn's radio, and on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a break,

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:18.880
it is the end of part A. That's right, it's not a short show this week, we're all here,

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.080
it's like you're finally getting a full OLR, now it's like three weeks later after Jamie

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:27.500
being sick, us having no show and then having a short show, the month of February was screwed,

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:32.880
but there's plenty more of regular, good old fashioned, hopefully unbroken OLR left to

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.320
go.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.600
Lots of stories coming up in part B, if you thought part A was PlayStation heavy, which

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.360
it was, because there was a lot of PlayStation news this week, which hopefully those people

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.400
that email us every now and then say, you don't show Sony enough love, you guys hate

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:49.000
Sony, blah blah blah, hopefully we proved you wrong tonight, we have plenty of Sony

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.760
stories tonight, but in the next segment, lots of Nintendo news came out as well, so

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:56.500
we'll be getting all the Nintendo news in the next segment, and some other randomness,

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.440
such as, what is the guy that created Pong up to now?

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.620
You might be surprised.

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:03.280
So we're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back with more of Orange

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.840
Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.440
Hi guys, it's Rob here with an important footnote for our podcast listeners.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:19.120
There's no easy way for me to break the news, but part B this week was lost, and unfortunately

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.480
won't be hitting the podcast feed, and you won't get that news, we promised, unless you

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.160
were listening live and heard all two hours of it being taped.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.000
So I'm sure you're wondering, what happened?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.600
Well, what happened is that we were taping the show, so we always do, and we do a special

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.480
little show after that called The Afterbirth, it's only for the live listeners, and because

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.840
we play licensed music and stuff that we can't put on the podcast, and as we were taping

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.360
that, right at the very end, we were trying to unjumble some of the cords back here, and

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:50.920
the power cord to the computer got detached, and the whole damn thing shut off, and although

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:56.040
Audition keeps a temporary file on hand, when I went in to recover the file, I made a mistake

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:59.640
and ended up deleting the damn files, I was trying to make a backup copy of it, and I've

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:04.160
tried everything, I can't get, it's not in the recycle bin, pick the chatroom's brain

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:08.860
on it, it's gone, it ain't coming back, so I'm very sorry, and Justin, I was thinking

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:11.080
March wouldn't be as broken as February.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:15.480
Anyhow, I guess one silver lining to this is that if you do want to hear Part B, it

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.880
is still archived on the Justin TV channel, so you can go to Justin.tv slash Orange Launch

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.560
Radio, and I believe some of our listeners are trying to make a highlight of the show

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:29.120
right now, now it's become this big lost archive of the show, it's like a collector's item

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.320
of sorts.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.200
We will try to get an audio rip of that, we're probably not going to put it on the podcast

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:39.420
feed because the audio quality on Justin.tv is not great, our microphones don't hook into

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:44.000
that, it simply goes to our webcam, and the audio is really not great, we'll probably,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.180
if anything, if we can get an audio rip of that, we'll probably put it on MySpace, Facebook

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:51.100
and all that stuff, unfortunately Part A is all the podcast listeners are going to get

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:56.260
this week, I am so sorry, in six years that we've been doing this show, we've never lost

01:20:56.260 --> 01:21:03.280
a show like that, so it's kind of embarrassing and a little sad, especially off of a few

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:08.080
broken weeks in a row, but what can you do, life goes on, I hope everybody has a wonderful

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:12.400
week, happy gaming, and we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week, with

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:28.960
all new power chords in studio, have a good one.
