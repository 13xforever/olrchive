[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

00:19.966 --> 00:24.309
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 16th of 2008.

00:24.369 --> 00:24.849
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy St.

00:24.890 --> 00:27.511
[SPEAKER_08]: Patrick's Day Eve to those of you out there.

00:27.551 --> 00:33.235
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget to wear green tomorrow or don't forget to wear green three days ago if you're listening on the podcast because you guys get a little late.

00:33.275 --> 00:39.060
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, that's just part of the perks of listening live to us every Sunday night when we tape over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.441
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a chat room full of people who are doing that right now.

00:41.962 --> 00:48.086
[SPEAKER_08]: And for all you guys, whether it be live, syndicated, or podcast, we're going to get back into the gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

00:48.894 --> 00:55.717
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and if you live in the United States, you're probably looking forward to some pretty cool games coming out into the arcade, like Tekken 6.

00:57.358 --> 01:01.500
[SPEAKER_07]: You're never going to get to play Tekken 6 because it's never coming to the arcade in the U.S.

01:02.661 --> 01:07.663
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to play it in the arcade, got to go to Japan or hopefully find an arcade that will import it for you.

01:09.004 --> 01:09.704
[SPEAKER_07]: So that kind of sucked.

01:10.124 --> 01:11.925
[SPEAKER_08]: Of which there are a few of those kind of places.

01:11.985 --> 01:14.366
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I think of that one place we always used to go to in L.A.

01:15.067 --> 01:15.287
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:15.307 --> 01:16.547
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that, Arcade Infinity?

01:16.567 --> 01:17.248
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that what it was called?

01:17.468 --> 01:17.608
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:17.935 --> 01:21.738
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently there are a few places that are importing them.

01:21.758 --> 01:30.385
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a place in Houston, I guess, that also has a Tekken 6 machine, but they're not going to be widely available like most fighting games are.

01:30.405 --> 01:31.866
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Namco Arcade, they'll have it.

01:32.787 --> 01:33.147
[SPEAKER_07]: You think?

01:34.008 --> 01:42.595
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure, because when I worked for Aladdin's Castle and Cyber Station, we had this super deluxe Tekken, this is when Tekken 3 came out,

01:43.288 --> 01:45.489
[SPEAKER_05]: But we had them well before everybody else did.

01:45.609 --> 01:46.410
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was a U.S.

01:46.470 --> 01:47.150
[SPEAKER_08]: release, right?

01:47.810 --> 01:52.573
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but we had them for months before they were allowed in any other arcade.

01:52.793 --> 02:01.397
[SPEAKER_08]: My curiosity is, though, I almost wonder if the opposite wouldn't be true, is that since this game won't come out in the U.S., then Namco Arcades wouldn't support them.

02:02.278 --> 02:02.598
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

02:02.678 --> 02:05.059
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think that they're going to have one or two.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.762
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that the bigger Namco locations would have one.

02:11.519 --> 02:12.179
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll see what happens.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.101
[SPEAKER_08]: Regardless, that kind of does suck, though.

02:14.501 --> 02:17.123
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, to hear that a new Tekken game is coming out in the arcades.

02:17.143 --> 02:18.504
[SPEAKER_05]: That pisses me off.

02:19.084 --> 02:19.805
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's sad.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.626
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's where arcades are going.

02:21.846 --> 02:24.308
[SPEAKER_08]: That shows you how lucrative arcades are right now.

02:24.368 --> 02:24.768
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sad.

02:24.828 --> 02:26.209
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes my heart hurt.

02:28.771 --> 02:35.516
[SPEAKER_08]: Usagi's in chat and says, Man, I have three gamers in this room with me, and they all gave me a dirty look when they got the news about Tekken 6.

02:35.816 --> 02:36.216
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys.

02:36.256 --> 02:36.876
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't write the news.

02:36.917 --> 02:37.557
[SPEAKER_08]: We just report it.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.360
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say write your cards and letters to Namco.

02:40.420 --> 02:43.381
[SPEAKER_08]: Let them know you want to see this game in the US and that you would spend money on it.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.703
[SPEAKER_07]: Say, Namco, we don't need any more fucking Pac-Man.

02:47.743 --> 02:48.763
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring us Tekken 6.

02:48.823 --> 02:49.763
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.884
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, phrase it just like that and see how far that gets you.

02:54.505 --> 02:54.765
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:54.785 --> 02:57.286
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me very, very sad.

02:57.326 --> 02:58.046
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to write a letter?

02:58.807 --> 03:01.348
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go there and run them over with a tank.

03:04.029 --> 03:04.409
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

03:06.038 --> 03:12.239
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to what's hopefully a little bit happier news, I don't know, Gran Turismo 5, the prologue version.

03:12.619 --> 03:14.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, some more information about that for the UK.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.861
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some information about the US last week, but now we have some more information for the UK.

03:18.921 --> 03:26.442
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be on the European PlayStation Store on March 27th, followed immediately the very next day by a version on Blu-ray.

03:26.542 --> 03:30.223
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, you can buy the prequel to a game that will be coming out on Blu-ray, whatever.

03:30.523 --> 03:33.364
[SPEAKER_08]: You all know the deal with Gran Turismo 5 prologue at this point.

03:34.066 --> 03:39.770
[SPEAKER_08]: The game will be coming out on that day and the price that you will pay for it is $24.99.

03:41.170 --> 03:45.973
[SPEAKER_08]: That's $24.99 pounds sterling in the UK.

03:46.374 --> 03:48.275
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about $50 US.

03:49.235 --> 03:51.317
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just because the US dollar sucks.

03:52.417 --> 03:53.618
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be at this point.

03:53.658 --> 03:54.018
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.079
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.

03:55.299 --> 03:56.400
[SPEAKER_08]: That still kind of sucks.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.942
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's like, oh, stuff's so much more expensive in the UK.

04:00.062 --> 04:01.423
[SPEAKER_07]: No, our dollar just really sucks.

04:01.463 --> 04:01.823
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

04:02.313 --> 04:04.895
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, there's the Europe PS3 bundle.

04:04.915 --> 04:08.518
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually getting a bundle that has Prologue in it.

04:08.818 --> 04:09.839
[SPEAKER_08]: £299 for that on March 28th.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.121
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about that last week.

04:12.541 --> 04:13.182
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

04:13.362 --> 04:14.783
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to remind.

04:15.103 --> 04:26.192
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have a little underscore on that saying, get you ready for the full game when it finally comes out and we'll sell it to you for $60 and you'll buy it because you are... The £60, which translates to $100 American, probably.

04:26.872 --> 04:30.195
[SPEAKER_07]: At that time, it would be like $6 billion American.

04:31.136 --> 04:31.356
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

04:32.319 --> 04:45.167
[SPEAKER_05]: For those loyal Tekken fans like me here over in the US, Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection Online players are going to be getting an update that allows the DualShock 3 support.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.268
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yay.

04:48.468 --> 04:59.215
[SPEAKER_05]: It also will have some different online tweaks, like a one-on-one pickup match, some updates to the lobby, and...

05:01.011 --> 05:03.212
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of your ranking updates, that type of thing.

05:03.232 --> 05:05.732
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, okay.

05:06.312 --> 05:07.512
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess that's kind of cool.

05:07.692 --> 05:17.235
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, considering most people were missing Rumble pretty badly, now the fact that they're going to bring it back, I guess... I don't know, is it too little too late, though?

05:18.235 --> 05:18.435
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

05:18.475 --> 05:23.436
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, do you think there'll be a lot of people that go back and say, oh, I'm going to run back and play Tekken 5 because I can have Rumble now?

05:24.836 --> 05:28.577
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worth a try, especially if you don't have to really pay anything for it.

05:29.147 --> 05:33.029
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think anyone's going to really go back and play those games just because it didn't have Rumble.

05:33.289 --> 05:33.769
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

05:33.789 --> 05:40.252
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, I think about myself, and I actually went back and played... Do you remember that game Crystal Quest that came out on Xbox Live like a year ago?

05:40.712 --> 05:42.473
[SPEAKER_08]: You know they did an upgrade to that not that long ago?

05:43.094 --> 05:48.636
[SPEAKER_08]: They had upgraded a game that added some type of combo meter in it, so I went back and played the game to see if the combo meter was exciting.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.917
[SPEAKER_08]: I played about half a game, then I quit.

05:51.578 --> 05:56.760
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was like, this game was much cooler when it was originally on the Apple in two colors, white and black.

05:58.919 --> 05:59.859
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:28.868 --> 06:30.349
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:56.522 --> 07:26.066
[SPEAKER_08]: tangent, tangent I played a strip poker game and CG was you remember those old school strip poker games they released for like the old systems like there was like they had strip poker on the Commodore 64 and all that stuff it was just basically these really pixelated pictures of women you know they had a CGA version of that there was I don't I remember that my grandparents or something bought us a Muppets game or something like that and we thought it didn't work

07:26.618 --> 07:28.739
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

07:49.041 --> 07:51.123
[SPEAKER_08]: Some folks in chat are asking what's CGA.

07:51.163 --> 07:55.267
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, CGA was the old school like PC color graphics adapter.

07:55.687 --> 07:59.270
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was when your monitors went from being monochrome to four colors.

08:00.111 --> 08:03.454
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could either have red, green, yellow, and black or cyan, magenta.

08:04.155 --> 08:06.297
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I missing?

08:06.717 --> 08:06.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Yellow.

08:07.037 --> 08:07.638
[SPEAKER_08]: Yellow and black?

08:07.938 --> 08:08.959
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but it wasn't that though, was it?

08:09.471 --> 08:10.011
[SPEAKER_08]: White and Black.

08:10.051 --> 08:11.212
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Cyan Magenta, White and Black.

08:11.252 --> 08:11.732
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.

08:12.753 --> 08:18.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then after CGA was EGA, Extended Graphics Adapter, when it went up to 16 colors.

08:18.636 --> 08:19.556
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we had VGA.

08:19.596 --> 08:20.537
[SPEAKER_08]: And then VGA, 256.

08:20.917 --> 08:21.998
[SPEAKER_08]: And then SGA.

08:22.118 --> 08:22.738
[SPEAKER_08]: Super VGA.

08:22.798 --> 08:25.760
[SPEAKER_08]: Super VGA, and pretty much everything you see now is some type of extension.

08:25.820 --> 08:26.960
[SPEAKER_08]: SGA, yeah.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.941
[SPEAKER_08]: All that crap.

08:28.961 --> 08:33.864
[SPEAKER_08]: A little history lesson from your old friends at Orange Lounge Radio, your ever-aging friends.

08:35.365 --> 08:37.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I remember playing on monochrome.

08:38.563 --> 08:39.924
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, to get back into the story here.

08:40.425 --> 08:42.406
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Street Fighter 4 for four colors, right?

08:42.486 --> 08:44.548
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Street Fighter 4, four color edition.

08:45.949 --> 08:54.275
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting a brand new character, a Lucha Libre wrestler named El Fuerte, or Fuerte, or I don't know how you pronounce it.

08:54.415 --> 08:55.436
[SPEAKER_08]: His name is El Farto?

08:55.456 --> 08:58.358
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder what his special is.

08:58.378 --> 09:00.740
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I believe it's Fuerte?

09:00.760 --> 09:01.360
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.563
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that a Howard Stern character, Fartman or something like that?

09:04.583 --> 09:05.203
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Fartman was a Howard Stern.

09:05.223 --> 09:07.065
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think Howard Stern will sue Capcom?

09:07.385 --> 09:07.485
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

09:08.070 --> 09:08.810
[SPEAKER_07]: El Asa Wipo

09:34.690 --> 09:35.910
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny?

09:37.851 --> 09:45.173
[SPEAKER_07]: I forced my wife to watch some Lucha Libre last night just very briefly because we couldn't find anything on TV.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.393
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, okay, Lucha Libre.

09:46.413 --> 09:47.234
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to turn that on.

09:48.094 --> 09:48.934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't like it.

09:50.354 --> 09:54.716
[SPEAKER_08]: RossDLUT in chat says, oh, yay, another piss-poor Hispanic stereotype.

09:55.836 --> 09:56.156
[SPEAKER_07]: Wrong.

09:56.476 --> 09:59.337
[SPEAKER_07]: Another piss-poor masked wrestler stereotype.

10:01.704 --> 10:01.924
[SPEAKER_08]: FirePro

10:30.765 --> 10:33.686
[SPEAKER_07]: Fire Pro Wrestling, they actually had a new game that came out last year.

10:34.886 --> 10:47.591
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I really think that, you know, we need to... Because, you know, a lot of the WWF games that come out, or WWE games that come out over here, have all of the moves from some of Japan's best wrestlers in it.

10:48.011 --> 10:52.012
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, why don't they just do a game called Stereotypical Wrestler of the Game?

10:53.073 --> 10:53.433
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

10:54.730 --> 11:04.355
[SPEAKER_05]: and have it just be... True, you wouldn't have your support of your WWE franchises and all that, but you have all these classic moves and stuff shoved into it.

11:04.775 --> 11:15.180
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of being stuck in 2D fighter like what was the old Wrestlemania that was out way back in the day where you could play as The Undertaker back when he was still really cool and not riding a bike.

11:17.401 --> 11:18.401
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else was in that?

11:18.701 --> 11:19.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Doink the Clown.

11:20.943 --> 11:21.763
[SPEAKER_05]: You could play as them.

11:23.037 --> 11:24.838
[SPEAKER_08]: I would rather play as Pennywise the Clown.

11:24.878 --> 11:26.279
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a video game I would buy.

11:26.359 --> 11:27.079
[SPEAKER_05]: We all float here.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, anyway.

11:30.161 --> 11:31.261
[SPEAKER_08]: Kiss me, fat boy.

11:33.022 --> 11:46.569
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they should just satisfy the world's apparent need that they think that we have for wrestler stereotypes and just do wrestler stereotype the game and have you make whatever you want.

11:50.147 --> 11:55.691
[SPEAKER_08]: I just worry that opens the door to racial stereotype the game and not going to be a good thing for video gaming's image.

11:56.171 --> 12:06.578
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a game that combines wrestling and Katamari so that as you're fighting them, body parts fall off and get stuck on your body and you're fighting them.

12:07.658 --> 12:12.541
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a fighting game where you're fighting tons of people and then your character has 50 arms and stuff.

12:12.561 --> 12:13.062
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be pretty cool.

12:13.082 --> 12:14.583
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that old school game?

12:15.023 --> 12:15.964
[SPEAKER_08]: Really old school.

12:16.304 --> 12:16.504
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

12:16.824 --> 12:17.704
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

12:46.471 --> 12:47.832
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the hand is really Mickey Mouse.

13:11.263 --> 13:12.204
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the happy one.

13:12.364 --> 13:14.326
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the one that the art is

13:32.113 --> 13:33.133
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:01.504 --> 14:02.725
[SPEAKER_08]: Something to note about that, though.

14:03.185 --> 14:09.088
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, in the stress test, the rumor is it's only Ken, it's only Ryu, and it's only one stage that you can play in.

14:09.968 --> 14:12.789
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, it's a sneak peek at what the game's going to look like.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.871
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to try another sneak peek of what the game will look like, it's called Street Fighter 2.

14:19.872 --> 14:21.073
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already available on Xbox Live.

14:21.153 --> 14:27.175
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually very excited about this because I had a whole bunch of Udon Kruise fans

14:29.152 --> 14:37.155
[SPEAKER_05]: and actually I keep them on my DeviantArt friends list just to see the previews and the new art coming out that they do and their work is fantastic.

14:37.315 --> 14:42.937
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really, really good and perfect for that genre.

14:42.957 --> 14:43.657
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really good.

14:43.777 --> 14:44.077
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.

14:44.157 --> 14:48.279
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't mean to knock the awesome art style in this game but do you know why this game keeps getting pushed back?

14:50.119 --> 14:52.760
[SPEAKER_08]: So that we'll forget we already spent $10 on it a year ago.

14:55.541 --> 14:56.241
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to say.

14:56.461 --> 14:57.162
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get it.

14:58.162 --> 14:58.282
[SPEAKER_08]: So

14:59.053 --> 15:00.874
[SPEAKER_08]: is a public beta of the game.

15:02.855 --> 15:03.675
[SPEAKER_08]: Call it what you will.

15:04.756 --> 15:05.076
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

15:05.116 --> 15:10.778
[SPEAKER_08]: In some way, it seems to me like kind of a cheap tactic to get people more incentive to buy this Commando 3.

15:11.659 --> 15:14.440
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, why do you think tons of people bought Crackdown?

15:14.460 --> 15:16.441
[SPEAKER_08]: But Crackdown actually ended up to be a really good game.

15:16.741 --> 15:22.724
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to say that Commando 3 won't as well, but it's interesting that that same tactic is now being employed elsewhere.

15:22.784 --> 15:23.804
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I could do.

15:23.904 --> 15:25.025
[SPEAKER_05]: I like jumping the game.

15:25.655 --> 15:26.315
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome, though.

15:26.335 --> 15:31.158
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the HD remake of 1942 that they were showing off to this week?

15:31.258 --> 15:32.158
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd heard about it.

15:32.238 --> 15:35.540
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't make the show real for tonight, but what did you see about this?

15:35.780 --> 15:36.781
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks awesome.

15:37.141 --> 15:37.681
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like 1942.

15:37.801 --> 15:38.642
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

15:38.702 --> 15:40.163
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great series of games.

15:40.363 --> 15:42.644
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically just redone all HD and pretty.

15:43.430 --> 15:43.810
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

15:43.830 --> 15:48.813
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, interesting that Capcom's revisiting a lot of their series in HD because you also have Bionic Commando also coming out.

15:48.853 --> 15:49.093
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

15:49.214 --> 15:59.820
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's kind of cool because a lot of us have been saying for a long time that's what they should be doing is, you know, remaking the games in HD and not just releasing, you know, frumpy old Tron with no frills.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.161
[SPEAKER_07]: and like shit like that.

16:01.281 --> 16:02.001
[SPEAKER_07]: That's retarded.

16:02.021 --> 16:05.764
[SPEAKER_08]: With one, you know, with one graphic swap that doesn't really change anything.

16:05.784 --> 16:07.945
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Contra, you know, Konami, we're looking at you.

16:08.205 --> 16:08.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, man.

16:09.306 --> 16:09.526
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

16:09.826 --> 16:12.728
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, we played Frogger, do something with it.

16:12.848 --> 16:13.028
[SPEAKER_07]: You know,

16:13.655 --> 16:16.336
[SPEAKER_07]: Just changing the sprites a little bit does not cut it.

16:17.076 --> 16:25.157
[SPEAKER_05]: I still thought it was funny that when we got the old Contra over here, it actually had less stuff to it than the original did.

16:26.037 --> 16:27.138
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what pissed me off?

16:27.158 --> 16:32.159
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what game I was randomly playing the other day, just for old time's sake, was Gyruss on Xbox Live Arcade.

16:32.179 --> 16:32.819
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet!

16:32.859 --> 16:35.799
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it is one of my all-time favorite shooters that they had in the arcade.

16:35.859 --> 16:37.020
[SPEAKER_08]: I freaking love Gyruss.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.680
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to play it on Commodore 64 all the time, right?

16:39.173 --> 16:39.273
[SPEAKER_08]: Cry.

16:39.393 --> 16:39.793
[SPEAKER_08]: Very sad.

16:39.813 --> 16:41.575
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little bit of other news that should make some people happy.

17:08.037 --> 17:13.862
[SPEAKER_05]: Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Special Edition is coming out in the UK.

17:18.661 --> 17:29.304
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually more of a special pre-order position, edition, sorry, that GameStation is offering that will have a 48-page art book and slipcase packaging.

17:29.364 --> 17:36.507
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be £29.99, and it's actually the same price as the non-special edition.

17:36.547 --> 17:42.469
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, you pre-order it from there, you get the Neato book, and you don't pay any different than you would have otherwise.

17:45.710 --> 17:45.890
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

17:48.335 --> 17:59.662
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also going to be getting Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII on PSP in spring, but GameStation has it down for summer, so you'll actually get it before then.

18:00.902 --> 18:02.383
[SPEAKER_05]: Just hop on there and take a look at it.

18:03.504 --> 18:04.584
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray for incentives.

18:05.685 --> 18:05.865
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

18:06.625 --> 18:06.845
[SPEAKER_07]: Neat.

18:07.326 --> 18:09.747
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, we're not getting anything like that over here as far as I'm aware.

18:10.848 --> 18:10.948
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo.

18:12.282 --> 18:12.402
[SPEAKER_07]: E.A.

18:12.442 --> 18:14.024
[SPEAKER_07]: and their bid to try to take over Take-Two

18:36.144 --> 19:03.625
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they have decided to go hostile with their bid and they're actually going to try to buy out individual shareholders now at $26 a share and no real comment to what's going to be happening here but apparently EA has confirmed that yes they are doing this and Take-Two has basically informed their shareholders to hold out a little bit to see

19:04.883 --> 19:06.184
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to happen in RRC?

19:06.204 --> 19:07.705
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of decision do they come up with?

19:08.785 --> 19:09.145
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

19:09.245 --> 19:10.426
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like the whole thing at all.

19:10.726 --> 19:19.770
[SPEAKER_07]: EA puts out some pretty good games, but at the same time, I know why they're doing it, just to get rid of the 2K sports franchise.

19:20.691 --> 19:22.212
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not a good thing.

19:23.672 --> 19:27.454
[SPEAKER_07]: The sports games really haven't innovated too much between releases and now.

19:27.954 --> 19:32.737
[SPEAKER_07]: If they have full reign over everything, what makes you think they're actually going to try to innovate each year?

19:32.777 --> 19:33.497
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have to.

19:34.561 --> 19:41.522
[SPEAKER_08]: Odd1 in chat at chat.orangelunchradio.com says, I expect EA to eventually just walk into the boardroom with socks full of quarters.

19:41.622 --> 19:42.523
[SPEAKER_08]: You're ours now.

19:43.623 --> 19:46.183
[SPEAKER_08]: RossDealUT says, Take two, put themselves in this position.

19:46.203 --> 19:48.284
[SPEAKER_08]: They're only ever in the green when GTA comes out.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.184
[SPEAKER_08]: So, of course, shareholders are nervous.

19:50.644 --> 19:57.705
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting point, though, kind of brought up there is that do you think that EA is trying to do this now before Grand Theft Auto hits shelves?

19:57.865 --> 19:58.065
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.586
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're trying to – and if the shareholders were smart –

20:02.423 --> 20:07.288
[SPEAKER_07]: They gotta know that Grand Theft Auto 4 is gonna fucking make tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of money.

20:07.709 --> 20:24.106
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem, and they are right, they don't have a lot of great releases that come out, but at the same time, I think a lot of their money has been trying to defend themselves against all these lawsuits and shit from stupid fuckers suing them for God knows what, blaming them for all sorts of violence and problems and

20:24.813 --> 20:25.333
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

20:52.961 --> 20:53.581
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:21.494 --> 21:24.015
[SPEAKER_08]: But this company relies so much on one game, I worry.

21:24.376 --> 21:30.219
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, everyone's focusing on Take-Two, but Take-Two owns a bunch of smaller companies that do release a lot of stuff.

21:30.239 --> 21:33.080
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, 2K releases quite a few games throughout the year.

21:33.821 --> 21:42.145
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, they do have a lot of smaller stuff that they deal with, like, not Destination, but like, no, Destination, or DSi games, I think they do.

21:42.645 --> 21:43.346
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Destineer.

21:43.566 --> 21:48.168
[SPEAKER_07]: But they have a lot of releases that come out that a lot of people don't realize are from them.

21:48.188 --> 21:49.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.077
[SPEAKER_07]: And they do have solid stuff coming out.

21:52.277 --> 21:55.038
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, yeah, they do rely a lot on Grand Theft Auto.

21:55.238 --> 21:59.279
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's Midnight Club, and they've got some good stuff in the pipelines.

21:59.299 --> 22:03.281
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Knorr and the new Mafia game looks okay.

22:03.401 --> 22:09.183
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that they're really that different than Grand Theft Auto, but at least they're pretty decent games.

22:09.303 --> 22:11.644
[SPEAKER_07]: And they make what they put out pretty good.

22:11.744 --> 22:14.304
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Warriors, holy crap, the Warriors game is awesome.

22:14.905 --> 22:15.725
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, I don't know.

22:17.440 --> 22:44.849
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather them kind of fumble through it and be their own entity than EA buy them because if EA buys them then I think that could be starting a downfall of the gaming industry because you're going to have EA and Activision owning everything and then pretty soon they're going to be like hey you know what we don't really have to innovate too much and then people are just going to lose interest in this shit and they're just like well fine I'm not going to buy any more games anymore and there goes the industry or the industry turns independent

22:45.731 --> 22:47.552
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

23:15.928 --> 23:22.689
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, the last two prequel games that they released, Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories, weren't that great and didn't make them that much money.

23:22.989 --> 23:27.070
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that much development time went into them, though, either, because they're pretty much just using the old engines.

23:27.570 --> 23:30.571
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the same thing that's going to happen with the newer games.

23:30.651 --> 23:34.451
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, the next game, they're probably going to do another Vice City or something like that.

23:34.891 --> 23:37.892
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be using a similar engine and another San Andreas.

23:37.952 --> 23:41.173
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they'll use another similar engine, and those will make a lot of money as well.

23:42.913 --> 23:43.213
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

23:43.891 --> 23:46.729
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of development up front, but I think they make it up in the back end a little bit.

23:47.999 --> 23:50.241
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, lots of legal news.

23:50.261 --> 23:51.882
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you could consider that some type of legal news.

23:51.922 --> 23:56.125
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's just lawsuits going everywhere this week, and they all center around Guitar Hero.

23:56.825 --> 24:01.508
[SPEAKER_08]: Harmonix actually sued and then unsued Activision earlier this week.

24:01.988 --> 24:14.657
[SPEAKER_08]: And it all had to do basically that, okay, the original Guitar Hero, I guess, had some type of clause that Harmonix would get some type of royalty payment, the way the royalty payments were set up, if they ever left the series.

24:15.796 --> 24:17.017
[SPEAKER_08]: and there were two different figures.

24:17.137 --> 24:27.966
[SPEAKER_08]: One was low, one was high and they're basically saying Harmonix was claimed that they were being paid the lower royalty scheme and they should be getting about $14.5 million out of Guitar Hero 3's profits.

24:28.626 --> 24:31.829
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I guess at some point this was retracted.

24:33.750 --> 24:39.154
[SPEAKER_08]: So there it was and I don't know if maybe there was some type of settlement out of court but the settlement was quickly retracted.

24:39.534 --> 24:40.135
[SPEAKER_08]: But then...

24:40.859 --> 24:42.300
[SPEAKER_08]: Gibson jumped in the mix.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.961
[SPEAKER_08]: Gibson, of course, makes guitars.

24:44.642 --> 24:46.784
[SPEAKER_08]: Gibson decided to sue Activision.

24:47.304 --> 24:57.311
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said the reason why is because Activision was actually infringing on a patent that dates back nine years for technology to simulate a musical performance.

24:59.113 --> 25:03.176
[SPEAKER_08]: Activision is, of course, filed basically saying that the claim is invalid.

25:04.218 --> 25:14.403
[SPEAKER_08]: Gibson actually sent Activision a letter in January saying... Activision basically said, you know, well, since you didn't really do anything about it, we thought it was okay.

25:16.444 --> 25:16.925
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

25:18.005 --> 25:19.186
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just like immersion.

25:20.386 --> 25:24.528
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you didn't say anything until now, so we thought it was okay that we stole your shit.

25:25.489 --> 25:27.550
[SPEAKER_08]: But I thought Gibson was licensed for Guitar Hero.

25:27.570 --> 25:30.051
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, don't they have Gibson guitars?

25:30.452 --> 25:30.732
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

25:31.532 --> 25:33.253
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is stupid.

25:34.093 --> 25:34.593
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

25:53.988 --> 25:54.468
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.725
[SPEAKER_05]: They think if it comes out in Japan, it's, you know, free reign to, you know, take it here.

26:23.326 --> 26:25.407
[SPEAKER_08]: Odd One says, I love that conspiracy theory.

26:25.487 --> 26:25.887
[SPEAKER_08]: I do too.

26:27.728 --> 26:31.010
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm pretty sure, I'm more than positive that that was the biggest influence.

26:31.730 --> 26:36.473
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm tired of people, like, patenting all this shit, like, you know, device to simulate performance.

26:36.823 --> 26:37.643
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:06.724 --> 27:07.765
[SPEAKER_07]: I now own the rights to that.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.886
[SPEAKER_07]: So all you fuckers better pay up because I need the money.

27:40.990 --> 27:51.899
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week, and I've got a couple actually, goes to this device that I'm about to put up on the webcam, and I am currently strapping it to my hand as I speak.

27:52.439 --> 28:01.487
[SPEAKER_05]: It is this stupid finger brace that they think I'm supposed to be wearing, that I'm not gonna, because it rubs a wall spot on my hand and I can't get it off.

28:03.008 --> 28:07.392
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, I didn't get the cortisone shot in the hand like I thought I was going to.

28:07.872 --> 28:08.833
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, um...

28:09.693 --> 28:15.476
[SPEAKER_05]: They're putting me in a brace for another month, and I get the cortisone shot right after my birthday.

28:16.756 --> 28:20.658
[SPEAKER_08]: You might want to say that, just really quickly one more time, because while you were trying to put the brace on, the mic was far away.

28:21.239 --> 28:22.159
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking over.

28:22.239 --> 28:23.380
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

28:23.520 --> 28:23.740
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.221
[SPEAKER_05]: I put this on because I'm going to put it on the webcam to show everybody.

28:27.522 --> 28:32.544
[SPEAKER_05]: They put me in a brace for my finger that I'm supposed to be wearing when I'm not typing or otherwise doing stuff.

28:32.584 --> 28:34.405
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a big pain in the ass because I can't.

28:35.686 --> 28:39.928
[SPEAKER_05]: It's to keep me from bending my finger at the primary joint where I've got the swelling on the tendon.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.729
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, they didn't do the cortisone shot.

28:42.809 --> 28:48.871
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, I am, um, uh, getting it done, uh, two days after my birthday.

28:49.111 --> 28:50.332
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fuck you enhancement tool.

28:50.712 --> 28:51.892
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a fuck you enhancement tool.

28:51.912 --> 28:53.033
[SPEAKER_08]: You should go show the folks on JustinTV.

28:53.073 --> 28:53.953
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said I was gonna.

28:53.993 --> 28:54.813
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, then go, go.

28:54.913 --> 29:01.416
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other, the other F you goes to my husband for, um, uh, assigning me housework.

29:01.997 --> 29:02.858
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, meanwhile, Loki.

29:27.678 --> 29:34.323
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the people that went and saw the movie Horton Hears a Who during our private screening.

29:34.643 --> 29:36.765
[SPEAKER_07]: Two groups of people in particular.

29:36.925 --> 29:45.010
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one was the people that thought it was smart to try to movie hop into our private screening for our company.

29:45.551 --> 29:52.075
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these are people that actually think that we're not going to notice somebody that doesn't work in our company coming in.

29:52.576 --> 29:55.678
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, with like a half an hour left of the movie to go...

29:56.144 --> 29:58.185
[SPEAKER_07]: with their four screaming kids.

29:58.665 --> 30:07.307
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after they came in, spilled popcorn on the floor, they also managed to ask people to move so that their screaming kids can sit in the seat.

30:07.787 --> 30:13.529
[SPEAKER_07]: Mind you that these people have been sitting watching the movie patiently for like an hour prior to that.

30:14.089 --> 30:20.531
[SPEAKER_07]: So, F you to them and also F you to the person sitting next to me with their screaming child who didn't want to be

30:21.874 --> 30:23.075
[SPEAKER_07]: or didn't want to watch the movie anymore.

30:23.115 --> 30:28.877
[SPEAKER_07]: He was running around in the aisles and stuff and smashing popcorn on the floor and slamming the seats down.

30:29.477 --> 30:32.138
[SPEAKER_07]: And the father was like, stop laughing, stop laughing.

30:32.638 --> 30:35.940
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare you laugh at this funny movie?

30:35.960 --> 30:37.160
[SPEAKER_04]: Should they have been kicked out?

30:38.081 --> 30:44.343
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they should have been, but movie theater people are lame and they don't like to do anything.

30:45.123 --> 30:46.524
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you get the manager.

30:47.406 --> 30:56.580
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I didn't feel like leaving the theater and I could possibly tolerate this kid, but he was annoying and everyone was staring at him, but the dad was just stupid, you know.

30:58.003 --> 31:01.308
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well, everyone will talk about him behind his back when he gets back to work on Monday.

31:03.587 --> 31:10.372
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to the random pains that I've been having and the fact that I was taking all these drugs to counter the pain.

31:10.392 --> 31:12.233
[SPEAKER_08]: And I might have caused more pain by doing that.

31:12.754 --> 31:24.562
[SPEAKER_08]: An FU to the fact that on the antibiotic I was taking, the sticker that says do not take with antacids was probably not large enough because I ended up taking an antacid and I think I fucked some... I hurt.

31:25.783 --> 31:28.585
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm having a hard time with tonight's show, but I'll be okay.

31:29.046 --> 31:30.887
[SPEAKER_08]: Just FU to mystery pain that after...

31:31.380 --> 31:35.102
[SPEAKER_08]: The lab tests and blood work and all this stuff I had, they still can't figure out what it is.

31:35.162 --> 31:38.843
[SPEAKER_08]: Although thankfully my abdominal pain is really going away, so I guess that's good.

31:40.204 --> 31:42.225
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those mystery things you'll never understand.

31:44.246 --> 31:46.387
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, F you to random sickness and pain.

31:47.267 --> 31:47.667
[SPEAKER_08]: It sucks.

31:49.188 --> 31:50.529
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not pregnant, chat.

31:50.729 --> 31:51.029
[SPEAKER_08]: F you.

31:51.809 --> 31:52.409
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to chat.

31:52.770 --> 31:53.990
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do they say you're pregnant?

31:54.090 --> 31:57.172
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, because when you have abdominal pain, it might be the baby kicking.

31:57.232 --> 31:57.572
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

31:59.072 --> 32:00.153
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't explain their reasoning.

32:00.919 --> 32:01.599
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:27.984 --> 32:32.887
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLabsRadio.com Send us those questions you've always wanted to ask us, those comments you wanted to say.

32:33.608 --> 32:37.510
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, DarkSakura will open up and read the crumbs that we do have.

32:39.211 --> 32:42.753
[SPEAKER_05]: First email comes from DJ Janai.

32:42.773 --> 32:45.335
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, hi, OLR, it's DJ Janai.

32:46.429 --> 32:47.590
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's not just a clever name.

32:47.610 --> 32:48.611
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, check this out.

32:48.631 --> 32:50.453
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it's a link to something.

32:50.493 --> 33:01.503
[SPEAKER_05]: SmileDK will be looking for their samurai at San Japan, first major anime convention in SA to premiere band...

33:04.284 --> 33:05.104
[SPEAKER_05]: First ever U.S.

33:05.164 --> 33:05.944
[SPEAKER_05]: debut concert.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.185
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's from a translation.

33:07.745 --> 33:17.507
[SPEAKER_05]: So, San Japan and Vivera Studios are proud to announce the North American musical debut concert of their fan favorite band, Smile DK.

33:17.947 --> 33:32.770
[SPEAKER_05]: Smile DK will be making their grand appearance at San Japan 1.5, the first major Japanese culture and anime convention in San Antonio, Texas, as they will be performing on August 9, 2008 at El Tropicano Riverwalk Hotel in downtown San Antonio, Texas.

33:33.536 --> 33:36.620
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I'm sure most of us know who SmileDK is.

33:36.680 --> 33:40.204
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway, they're going to have a new single.

33:40.244 --> 33:41.125
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought that was pretty cool.

33:41.165 --> 33:43.708
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks for letting us know about that so that we can tell everybody.

33:45.510 --> 33:46.732
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they sing Butterfly.

33:51.577 --> 33:54.359
[SPEAKER_05]: Next one.

33:54.499 --> 34:00.825
[SPEAKER_05]: As an avid UK-based listener of your show, my heart nearly skipped a beat at the news last week of Super Smash Bros.

34:00.845 --> 34:01.545
[SPEAKER_05]: Brawl's launch.

34:01.665 --> 34:08.951
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine my horror but lack of disbelief when I then checked with my friendly favorite online retailer and found out that Super Smash Bros.

34:08.991 --> 34:11.954
[SPEAKER_05]: Brawl wasn't to be released until June in the UK.

34:12.354 --> 34:17.158
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, a three-month wait for a AAA title that has already been translated into English.

34:18.536 --> 34:20.558
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is, I know why this happens.

34:20.638 --> 34:25.601
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the whole NTSC, PAL, and multiple European language thing means that there will be delays.

34:25.821 --> 34:28.502
[SPEAKER_05]: But Nintendo has launched simultaneous releases before.

34:29.723 --> 34:35.887
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, I really don't see why Nintendo and other companies cannot treat the UK as a separate territory to the rest of Europe.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.448
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even have the same taste in games.

34:38.528 --> 34:41.850
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I wish to arouse traditional British anti-continental sentiment.

34:42.350 --> 34:46.973
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's in English, release the damn game in the country that made the damn language.

34:48.541 --> 34:52.924
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a lot of games that get released in the UK, too, that we don't receive over here until a lot later.

34:52.944 --> 34:53.624
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get Mother 3.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.265
[SPEAKER_07]: Like anything from Eidos.

34:55.865 --> 34:56.886
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get Mother 3.

34:58.527 --> 35:05.731
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing, too, is that a lot of games like Smash Bros., it's selling like hotcakes, and they can't make enough discs.

35:06.471 --> 35:07.532
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's more to this email.

35:08.412 --> 35:09.453
[SPEAKER_05]: As for Super Smash Bros.

35:09.473 --> 35:15.316
[SPEAKER_05]: Brawl, I bought the new freeloader disc for the Wii and have imported a copy of the game from Canada.

35:15.657 --> 35:17.858
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's me flipping the bird to you, Nintendo of Europe.

35:18.653 --> 35:21.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, as for the Didgeridoo Techno guy, I've seen him in person.

35:22.214 --> 35:27.296
[SPEAKER_05]: He was playing on the streets of Edinburgh during the Edinburgh Arts Festival in Scotland last summer.

35:27.756 --> 35:31.317
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my own video footage if you want to see slash hear more.

35:31.977 --> 35:33.618
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess it would be pronounced nige.

35:34.238 --> 35:35.358
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it's written down.

35:36.439 --> 35:36.979
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's cool.

35:37.019 --> 35:37.699
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to see.

35:38.699 --> 35:40.860
[SPEAKER_05]: I would actually really, really dig seeing that.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.001
[SPEAKER_05]: In case he played something different.

35:46.122 --> 35:46.582
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

35:47.222 --> 35:47.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email.

35:49.166 --> 35:53.687
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey OLR crew, in the words of AVGN, you know what's bullshit?

35:55.928 --> 35:59.889
[SPEAKER_05]: People who complain that a game is too short just because it takes under 10 hours to complete.

36:00.369 --> 36:05.250
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened to a time when games usually took 30-60 minutes to clear and gamers were happy with it?

36:05.790 --> 36:13.972
[SPEAKER_05]: These days when I read a review of an arcade style scrolling shooter or 2D platformer, one complaint that I see commonly that sticks out to me is that the game is short.

36:14.995 --> 36:24.639
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that longer, more epic games allow you to take in the game environment, absorb yourself in the character, but it's nice to play a quick, short game that is intended to be replayed again and again.

36:25.080 --> 36:29.962
[SPEAKER_05]: Even Gradius V, a shooter that takes an hour and a half to complete, gets complaints of being too short.

36:30.662 --> 36:38.546
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone please explain to me how 25 hours would work out, and how that isn't going to put a strain on the level designers.

36:39.786 --> 36:40.927
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, a year and a half ago,

36:41.360 --> 36:43.923
[SPEAKER_05]: You asked listeners if games these days are getting easier.

36:44.283 --> 36:45.544
[SPEAKER_05]: This is related to that question.

36:45.564 --> 36:50.730
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think games are getting longer and longer and that shorter, meant to be beaten in one sitting games are going away?

36:50.950 --> 36:51.470
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from GS68.

36:53.842 --> 37:00.385
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head there is that it's not the fact maybe that a game takes less than 10 hours to beat that people rag on it.

37:00.685 --> 37:04.907
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it has no replay value, then, you know, it sucks.

37:05.827 --> 37:09.089
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, a game like Katamari Damacy, can't you roll through that game?

37:09.689 --> 37:11.650
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't you roll through that game in like two, three hours tops?

37:11.850 --> 37:14.251
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you can go back through and get the challenges.

37:14.431 --> 37:14.931
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

37:14.951 --> 37:19.493
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what people love that game because you have the total replay value and just, you know, it's cool to go roll stuff up.

37:19.853 --> 37:23.336
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, even though I kind of think they've beaten the Katamari franchise in the ground, but never mind.

37:23.376 --> 37:24.837
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about the original one.

37:25.397 --> 37:27.099
[SPEAKER_08]: It had definite replay value to it.

37:27.299 --> 37:31.962
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've gone back, though, and put in all of our old shooters before, even though you pretty much play them all the same way.

37:32.122 --> 37:32.323
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

37:32.463 --> 37:36.666
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how many times do I just go talking about loving our type?

37:37.395 --> 37:37.915
[SPEAKER_05]: For example.

37:38.095 --> 37:44.377
[SPEAKER_08]: But a game like a role-playing game that really relies on story to motivate you to play the game.

37:44.437 --> 37:48.479
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you play through the story once, very few RPGs have a lot of replay value.

37:48.519 --> 37:49.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Chrono Trigger.

37:49.959 --> 37:53.921
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously some do, be it multiple endings, super bosses, whatever it is.

37:54.561 --> 37:56.602
[SPEAKER_08]: They try to put a little more value in it.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.122
[SPEAKER_05]: Every RPG needs Game Plus.

37:59.503 --> 38:06.185
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's why some RPGs feel a little bit lacking is that when they don't have that and they're only 10 hours to beat, then it might be.

38:06.587 --> 38:08.688
[SPEAKER_08]: So it really depends on what type of game it is, I guess.

38:09.449 --> 38:13.592
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is even bringing up, though, people complaining that Grotty S5 was short even though it was an hour and a half.

38:13.732 --> 38:18.035
[SPEAKER_05]: And I completely disagree with them saying it was remotely short.

38:18.615 --> 38:23.198
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that a shooter, you know, shouldn't need to be more than, like, an hour in length.

38:23.799 --> 38:34.086
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the whole point is to get from point A to point B. And then hopefully pass the boss at point B and get to point C. You know, I actually liked...

38:35.015 --> 38:37.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the, I guess, not as long shooters.

38:37.921 --> 38:44.934
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I played through Cotton however many times and Raiden DX is another one of my favorite shooter games.

38:47.333 --> 38:54.901
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes with shooter games, part of the fun is trying to play it through it and beat your score or beat it faster, you know, and start to learn the patterns in the game, you know.

38:55.402 --> 38:56.683
[SPEAKER_05]: I could tell you anything.

38:56.843 --> 39:06.054
[SPEAKER_05]: I could probably pick up Sky Shark right now and play through the first four levels and not die because I had the game memorized because that's the only damn way you could play through that game was to memorize where everything was.

39:06.674 --> 39:06.954
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

39:07.235 --> 39:08.216
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, I mean...

39:09.008 --> 39:09.288
[SPEAKER_05]: Just now?

39:37.445 --> 39:39.146
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just now, but we got it right before I pulled up.

39:39.346 --> 39:39.626
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.127
[SPEAKER_05]: So, virtual console games are overpriced.

39:43.147 --> 39:44.968
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have already gone over this.

39:45.348 --> 39:50.109
[SPEAKER_05]: But you haven't gone over it in a while, so this is kind of irrelevant to, well, anything.

39:50.469 --> 39:53.630
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have an idea to fix it.

39:54.931 --> 40:00.392
[SPEAKER_05]: If people pay yearly subscriptions for Xbox Live, Nintendo could do something like that for virtual console.

40:00.853 --> 40:04.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I mean exactly along the lines of the Sega Channel, because I freaking love the Sega Channel.

40:05.302 --> 40:08.543
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not... I'm not actually sure how it would work, but I thought I would share it.

40:08.563 --> 40:09.744
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's from Red Winged Saturn.

40:12.945 --> 40:13.145
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

40:13.625 --> 40:13.946
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

40:13.966 --> 40:14.706
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on time?

40:14.766 --> 40:15.066
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick?

40:15.166 --> 40:16.327
[SPEAKER_08]: I was working on something else.

40:16.347 --> 40:16.587
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

40:17.387 --> 40:19.608
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've brought this up... We've actually brought this up on the show.

40:19.948 --> 40:24.190
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of paying for your virtual console games, you pay a subscription cost.

40:24.270 --> 40:25.790
[SPEAKER_05]: Like... Oh, like GameTap.

40:26.631 --> 40:26.831
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

40:26.851 --> 40:27.311
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically.

40:28.331 --> 40:30.412
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to see Nintendo set something like that up.

40:30.952 --> 40:32.013
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something like Sega Channel.

40:32.683 --> 40:37.626
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of their games, you don't want to spend $5 on a game that you only want to play a couple times.

40:38.087 --> 40:43.890
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's exactly why it's not set up that way, because I think Nintendo, in a way, kind of preys on that sort of system.

40:45.191 --> 40:47.553
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also heard of Xbox Live.

40:47.973 --> 40:52.736
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody had suggested instead of charging the $5 for the game, you pay $0.25 a play.

40:55.467 --> 40:59.289
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I think about some of the systems back in the 80s and 90s.

40:59.349 --> 41:01.870
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember I had an old school cable system back in the 80s.

41:01.910 --> 41:02.970
[SPEAKER_08]: It was way ahead of its time.

41:03.730 --> 41:07.772
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a system where you could actually buy games for like 10 cents a game and play them.

41:08.652 --> 41:09.533
[SPEAKER_08]: And it didn't do very well.

41:09.953 --> 41:10.933
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't very well received.

41:10.973 --> 41:13.134
[SPEAKER_08]: People don't like to play that way for whatever reason.

41:16.756 --> 41:19.637
[SPEAKER_08]: I think honestly if they stop making money, they'll change it.

41:19.697 --> 41:20.857
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the meantime, it works.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.318
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it ain't broke, they ain't going to fix it.

41:22.714 --> 41:28.198
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it might sound better from a consumer end, but, you know, look at what GameTap is made up of, though.

41:28.238 --> 41:39.525
[SPEAKER_08]: GameTap kind of makes a thriving on, it doesn't have a lot of, I mean, it has, I shouldn't say it doesn't have a lot, it has some huge name AAA titles in it, but a lot of GameTap's charm is discovering old classics you missed the first time.

41:40.505 --> 41:44.208
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo, Xbox Live, they don't really need to do that for various reasons, so.

41:45.548 --> 41:46.409
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the last email?

41:47.270 --> 41:47.770
[SPEAKER_05]: It was.

41:48.190 --> 41:48.971
[SPEAKER_05]: I double checked.

41:49.191 --> 41:49.471
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

41:50.287 --> 41:51.107
[SPEAKER_08]: AOR, it's PKJR92.

42:18.493 --> 42:33.298
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to tell you guys that you guys are the greatest, and if not for the difference in time zones, I will do some live every Sunday, and every show on your network.

42:33.938 --> 42:45.182
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want to say, you guys are great, thanks, and to do a show earlier, like earlier,

42:45.959 --> 42:51.623
[SPEAKER_09]: so that people in other time zones like me, I'm like three hours behind you, or sorry, ahead of you.

42:52.524 --> 42:59.288
[SPEAKER_09]: So, 12 o'clock at night is kind of late, because I've got school tomorrow, school the next day, etc.

43:01.790 --> 43:10.076
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want to say that keep going, because you guys are the only podcast I listen to.

43:10.436 --> 43:11.777
[SPEAKER_09]: So, the only ones I like.

43:12.737 --> 43:13.478
[SPEAKER_09]: So, see ya.

43:14.637 --> 43:15.197
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43:38.343 --> 43:40.344
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about that in our super secret forums where we discuss show thingies.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.261
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so we'll make that happen for you guys.

44:08.581 --> 44:09.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do one more voicemail.

44:09.821 --> 44:10.821
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought this one was pretty good.

44:12.502 --> 44:15.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, this is DSMaster25.

44:15.763 --> 44:18.304
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge Hannah fan.

44:18.444 --> 44:21.405
[SPEAKER_03]: How dare you bash Hannah Montana?

44:22.285 --> 44:23.245
[SPEAKER_03]: Good lord.

44:24.666 --> 44:26.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your best Sony for once.

44:26.907 --> 44:28.407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see them get bashed.

44:28.487 --> 44:30.328
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my favorite pop star.

44:30.868 --> 44:34.029
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Miss Miley, aka Hannah Montana.

44:45.340 --> 44:51.442
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I didn't realize we had legions of Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus fans that listen to our show.

44:51.522 --> 44:56.803
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we need to take a moment to apologize to all the Hannah Montana fans that listen to our program.

44:59.604 --> 45:02.485
[SPEAKER_08]: So we apologize dearly.

45:03.143 --> 45:23.509
[SPEAKER_08]: if you were offended by our comments on Hannah Montana no we don't and we're really sorry we won't try to do it or we'll try not to do that again in the future and remember hey we're big fans of Hannah Montana's DS game especially Footy Monster but don't listen to him it's not because it's a good music game he just secretly really loves Hannah Montana

45:33.328 --> 45:35.149
[SPEAKER_08]: I just love the chat lighting up here.

45:35.529 --> 45:37.330
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Dollar Bill, what the fuck is this?

45:37.690 --> 45:39.611
[SPEAKER_08]: RawSteelUT, the fuck is this trash?

45:40.031 --> 45:41.952
[SPEAKER_08]: Frisbee, why do people actually like her?

45:42.872 --> 45:44.573
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Dollar Bill, I've never even heard her.

45:46.134 --> 45:47.234
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what's popular?

45:52.717 --> 45:54.017
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave Hannah alone.

45:54.378 --> 45:55.298
[SPEAKER_08]: How was that voicemail?

45:55.458 --> 45:57.059
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave Hannah alone.

45:58.880 --> 45:59.400
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

45:59.870 --> 46:01.511
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, doing the whole Britney thing.

46:01.571 --> 46:02.512
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

46:02.712 --> 46:03.913
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, back to gaming, please.

46:05.114 --> 46:08.636
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, I'm sure, is a shocker to everybody, but guess what?

46:09.437 --> 46:20.184
[SPEAKER_07]: 2K Marin is actually working on Bioshock 2, and they have peg day forecasted release date of quarter four, 2009.

46:20.224 --> 46:22.826
[SPEAKER_07]: So Christmas 2009, you'll be playing Bioshock 2.

46:28.359 --> 46:29.639
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray!

46:31.100 --> 46:32.220
[SPEAKER_07]: That's shocking.

46:34.981 --> 46:35.241
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

46:35.702 --> 46:37.662
[SPEAKER_08]: Bioshock 2 is coming out?

46:38.042 --> 46:39.223
[SPEAKER_08]: I am so shocked.

46:39.663 --> 46:40.443
[SPEAKER_08]: Beyond belief.

46:41.584 --> 46:42.684
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have never guessed.

46:45.105 --> 46:45.765
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

46:46.165 --> 46:48.006
[SPEAKER_07]: EA's working on Madden 2009.

46:48.566 --> 46:49.486
[SPEAKER_07]: And after that, Madden 2010.

46:49.826 --> 46:53.508
[SPEAKER_07]: Aren't you violating an NDA by saying that?

46:53.948 --> 46:54.448
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be.

46:54.963 --> 46:55.543
[SPEAKER_07]: Guilty Gear Guilty Gear

47:25.433 --> 47:30.595
[SPEAKER_08]: Guilty Gear 2 Overture is coming out, but it's not the same type of Guilty Gear you might be thinking of.

47:30.655 --> 47:32.635
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out this fall for the Xbox 360.

47:32.715 --> 47:34.276
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a tactical action game.

47:34.736 --> 47:36.016
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's like 3D.

47:36.616 --> 47:44.679
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes all these characters you might know from the Guilty Gear, which, by the way, is a 2D fighting game, and now they're going to be in a 3D action strategy type of game.

47:46.639 --> 47:49.500
[SPEAKER_08]: It worked so well for Soul Calibur when it went to Soul Calibur Legends.

47:49.900 --> 47:51.061
[SPEAKER_07]: I've played it, actually.

47:51.401 --> 47:51.701
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

47:51.881 --> 47:52.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

47:54.090 --> 47:57.452
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for having a Japanese account on Xbox Live.

47:58.472 --> 47:59.033
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

47:59.313 --> 48:04.755
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar to Dynasty Warriors on 99 Nights.

48:05.696 --> 48:07.537
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the Guilty Gear universe.

48:08.437 --> 48:11.819
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually kind of liked 99 Nights for a little bit.

48:12.019 --> 48:13.339
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it got a little old to me.

48:13.439 --> 48:14.420
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar to that.

48:14.620 --> 48:20.082
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got enemies you kill and then checkpoints you get to and you take them over and that kind of stuff.

48:20.863 --> 48:21.043
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

48:21.727 --> 48:23.908
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely not a fighting game if that's what you're expecting.

48:25.549 --> 48:26.069
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

48:26.610 --> 48:34.053
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wish a lot of these things, when they come to new systems, you know what, people just like fighting games, so just release Guilty Gear as a fighting game.

48:34.254 --> 48:38.556
[SPEAKER_07]: But they did do that already on the Wii, so at least they get it for some systems.

48:39.556 --> 48:41.237
[SPEAKER_07]: Others are just trying something a little different.

48:42.178 --> 48:43.118
[SPEAKER_07]: More power to them, I guess.

48:43.598 --> 48:45.559
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to innovate, SNK.

48:46.380 --> 48:46.800
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

48:48.829 --> 48:49.430
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

48:49.690 --> 48:51.892
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'll probably just end up passing on this game.

48:52.232 --> 48:52.852
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's just me.

48:53.173 --> 48:57.677
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, other people who said pass were actually Microsoft.

48:59.518 --> 49:07.665
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a rumor going around, especially since Sony executives told the Financial Times that Sony was in talks with

49:08.381 --> 49:12.385
[SPEAKER_05]: with Microsoft about offering them a Blu-ray drive for the Xbox 360.

49:13.305 --> 49:19.530
[SPEAKER_05]: But Aaron Greenberg, who's their group product manager for Xbox 360, said, nah, no.

49:20.211 --> 49:27.617
[SPEAKER_05]: To quote, Xbox is not currently in talks with Sony or the Blu-ray Association to integrate Blu-ray into the Xbox experience.

49:28.137 --> 49:31.320
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a neat way to phrase it, the Xbox experience.

49:32.220 --> 49:32.441
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

49:33.510 --> 49:41.093
[SPEAKER_05]: He did go on to say though that right now Xbox 360 is the only console offering digital distribution of entertainment content.

49:43.775 --> 49:50.678
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't really know how long they're going to be the only ones that does that, seeing that Sony owns a movie company.

49:51.598 --> 50:01.202
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, a bunch of us who lucked out the tail end of that and picked up one of those cheap HD DVD players, hey, I even got five free HD DVDs.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.242
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox Experience.

50:06.703 --> 50:07.784
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, that's so cool.

50:07.804 --> 50:10.066
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what the Xbox Live Experience is?

50:11.368 --> 50:14.371
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit, fuck, gay, gay, fuck, fuck.

50:15.493 --> 50:17.555
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the Xbox Live Experience right there.

50:19.097 --> 50:21.219
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of other words in there too I don't feel like repeating.

50:21.239 --> 50:24.503
[SPEAKER_07]: So what part of the Xbox Experience is the Red Ring of Death?

50:24.523 --> 50:25.104
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that...

50:27.540 --> 50:28.400
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the fun part?

50:28.560 --> 50:30.301
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just wondering.

50:30.681 --> 50:36.104
[SPEAKER_08]: I did think that was a witty retort, though, that the Xbox does not need a Blu-ray drive because they have downloadable movies.

50:36.504 --> 50:37.004
[SPEAKER_08]: So ha.

50:37.264 --> 50:39.025
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're already high definition.

50:40.105 --> 50:43.567
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, here's a little problem with that logic, though, folks.

50:43.687 --> 50:50.250
[SPEAKER_07]: And anyone that actually watches a lot of pay-per-view stuff knows movies don't come out on street date on that service.

50:50.330 --> 50:51.250
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually it's a month later.

50:51.370 --> 50:55.272
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to watch it day one, Blu-ray...

50:55.953 --> 50:58.834
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hopefully Blu-ray is the only way to go on that stuff.

50:59.475 --> 51:01.095
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can watch it on DVD, I guess.

51:03.617 --> 51:08.259
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the angle they should work on that shit, but who really cares?

51:08.319 --> 51:09.359
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

51:09.940 --> 51:21.765
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that them accepting Blu-ray right now into their experience is sort of like admitting some sort of defeat to Sony in some respect.

51:23.906 --> 51:25.147
[SPEAKER_07]: We ain't talking to those bitches.

51:25.987 --> 51:26.667
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, uh-uh.

51:27.228 --> 51:28.288
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what they have.

51:28.368 --> 51:29.109
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want their shit.

51:29.389 --> 51:33.772
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, it would look kind of silly for Microsoft to kind of endorse a Sony product like that.

51:34.132 --> 51:38.594
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would think that in the next Microsoft system, they're going to have to support Blu-ray somehow.

51:39.095 --> 51:39.615
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think.

51:39.735 --> 51:40.595
[SPEAKER_08]: But who knows, you know?

51:40.956 --> 51:42.176
[SPEAKER_08]: Wiis don't play DVDs.

51:42.196 --> 51:45.118
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't necessarily have to play movies to be a console that succeeds.

51:45.138 --> 51:46.799
[SPEAKER_04]: They can always do the Dreamcast path.

51:47.019 --> 51:51.582
[SPEAKER_07]: They can always put HD DVD drives in there and use that as the format for the system.

51:51.642 --> 51:54.924
[SPEAKER_07]: Because who says that they have to stop making discs for it?

51:54.984 --> 51:55.264
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

51:56.147 --> 52:00.630
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though Toshiba stopped making them, but still at the same time, who makes UMDs?

52:01.691 --> 52:05.853
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't that seem like a step backwards if Microsoft in their next system put an HD DVD drive in them?

52:05.873 --> 52:06.814
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be hard to copy them.

52:07.614 --> 52:10.176
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no HD DVD drives out there now, would it?

52:10.376 --> 52:11.217
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting thought.

52:11.757 --> 52:14.198
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose you have this format already built up in some movie.

52:14.279 --> 52:16.320
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be interesting, but I don't know.

52:16.340 --> 52:17.220
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't see it happening.

52:17.481 --> 52:21.903
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be akin to using the, like I was bringing up with the Dreamcast, it'd be akin to using the GigaDiscs.

52:22.724 --> 52:24.445
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know how long it took them to crack those.

52:28.940 --> 52:35.522
[SPEAKER_07]: One cool thing, though, that is entertainment-related and, I guess, download content, New Islands coming to Burnout Paradise.

52:35.862 --> 52:41.543
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of new stuff that you'll be able to play and drive your cars through and crash through and stuff.

52:41.703 --> 52:52.926
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, actually, you can kind of see some of what's going to be available on that in the game right now because there's actually bridges that are being worked on and constructed, I guess, in the game.

52:53.579 --> 52:56.321
[SPEAKER_07]: So later on, what they're going to do is have a free download.

52:56.682 --> 52:59.244
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because these islands are going to be free.

52:59.344 --> 53:00.004
[SPEAKER_07]: I like free.

53:00.224 --> 53:04.188
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be able to expand your experience on Burnout Paradise.

53:04.588 --> 53:06.990
[SPEAKER_07]: There are also going to be some new cars available as well.

53:07.170 --> 53:07.930
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are not free.

53:09.031 --> 53:09.852
[SPEAKER_07]: But those are optional.

53:10.132 --> 53:10.573
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

53:10.773 --> 53:13.615
[SPEAKER_07]: Who really needs extra cars when there's a lot in the game anyways?

53:13.675 --> 53:14.235
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

53:14.255 --> 53:18.199
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a hardcore racing fan, but I would think the new areas are more of a perk than a new car.

53:18.619 --> 53:18.819
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

53:19.760 --> 53:19.920
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

53:20.131 --> 53:40.395
[SPEAKER_07]: by a long shot unless the new car is a super jet mobile that can like jump 500 miles or something like that in which case I'll need that the new car is Sonic just like was it in Ridge Racer you know where you have the hover cars and the rocket cars that's one thing about Ridge Racer it's awesome

53:41.004 --> 53:41.504
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto 4

54:11.485 --> 54:12.326
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, very cool.

54:12.486 --> 54:15.788
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I'm not too optimistic about this sixth one.

54:16.789 --> 54:17.289
[SPEAKER_07]: But five.

54:17.870 --> 54:30.199
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the games from their translations, Hangman's Noose, Carjack City, Bomb Da Base, Mafia Work, Deathmatch, Turf War, Cops and Crooks, Race, Deal Breaker, Free Mode.

54:31.440 --> 54:34.963
[SPEAKER_08]: We are gonna, you know... Does it sound legit to you?

54:35.143 --> 54:35.923
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it sounds legit.

54:35.943 --> 54:37.725
[SPEAKER_07]: That stuff sounds very legit.

54:38.005 --> 54:38.105
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

54:40.322 --> 54:41.042
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to play this game.

54:41.062 --> 54:42.503
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be playing this thing every day, dude.

54:43.043 --> 54:46.364
[SPEAKER_07]: And... I don't know, we're just going to kick everyone's ass online.

54:46.404 --> 54:46.844
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be fun.

54:47.905 --> 54:49.866
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope the game sucks, just to spite you.

54:50.306 --> 54:50.826
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Too bad it's not going to happen.

54:54.547 --> 54:54.927
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

54:55.948 --> 55:01.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this actually makes me kind of happy, because everyone knows I'm a big Dreamcast fan.

55:02.730 --> 55:10.494
[SPEAKER_05]: We are getting Mr. Driller Online, a downloadable version that's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

55:11.015 --> 55:16.277
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a whole bunch of details on it right now, but it's been confirmed for a spring release in Japan.

55:16.798 --> 55:20.920
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully we won't get it too much longer after, and it's Mr. Driller.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.561
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we'll get it at the same time.

55:22.721 --> 55:28.123
[SPEAKER_07]: There hasn't really been any releases in Japan on Xbox Live Arcade that we haven't gotten at the same time.

55:28.684 --> 55:29.504
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then even better.

55:30.925 --> 55:31.245
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

55:32.726 --> 55:37.107
[SPEAKER_08]: Hitstun in chat says, this looks just like Mr. Driller DS.

55:38.987 --> 55:39.867
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't doubt that.

55:39.927 --> 55:40.787
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Mr. Driller.

55:43.148 --> 55:47.229
[SPEAKER_08]: It probably does look like most versions of Mr. Driller because it is Mr. Driller.

55:50.129 --> 55:51.209
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Driller is kind of cool.

55:52.850 --> 55:56.410
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems really easy at first, but there's a lot of depth to the puzzle in the game.

55:56.710 --> 55:57.290
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting.

55:58.871 --> 56:00.271
[SPEAKER_07]: A new version of the

56:01.158 --> 56:08.622
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii's Twilight hack, and that is the hack using Twilight Princess to run homebrew code, has been made available.

56:08.883 --> 56:22.290
[SPEAKER_07]: It's version 0.1.a3, and now what's kind of neat about it is that you'll be able to run data off of SD memory cards using the SD memory card slot in the Wii system itself.

56:22.610 --> 56:29.795
[SPEAKER_07]: Prior to that, you would have to have an SD Gecko or some sort of GameCube adapter to run it off of...

56:30.896 --> 56:33.217
[SPEAKER_07]: SD memory cards, but now you can actually do it on the drive.

56:33.537 --> 56:35.637
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now though, not many things supporting it.

56:35.837 --> 56:40.779
[SPEAKER_07]: Only game that actually works with it right now is a version of Tetris.

56:41.459 --> 56:45.780
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, soon it will be, you know, supporting a lot more things.

56:46.340 --> 56:51.342
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's just kind of interesting that they have this exploit in there and I don't know if Nintendo will be able to fix it.

56:52.602 --> 56:54.043
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it'll be in the next patch.

56:54.363 --> 56:55.883
[SPEAKER_08]: That loophole's going to get closed right up.

56:57.484 --> 56:57.984
[SPEAKER_08]: But who knows?

56:58.424 --> 56:59.144
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll luck out.

57:00.816 --> 57:03.018
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know it's worked out well for Sony so far.

57:03.998 --> 57:15.567
[SPEAKER_08]: Some folks that have not lucked out are folks that were looking forward to playing Army of Two across different regions because Army of Two apparently has region-locked online play.

57:16.347 --> 57:20.110
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a very, very small little note in the manual for Army of Two.

57:20.611 --> 57:26.635
[SPEAKER_08]: Note, the online game modes in Army of Two are not cross-region compatible and is only supported between PAL disks.

57:27.175 --> 57:29.357
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the PAL version's manual has that note in there.

57:29.693 --> 57:34.674
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you were looking forward to playing folks in Europe, if you're in the US, sorry, can't do it in Army of Two.

57:35.374 --> 57:42.676
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, some people are pretty pissed off about this, but, I don't know, in a way, I kind of wonder, like, well, is it maybe because the lag is too great?

57:42.796 --> 57:45.196
[SPEAKER_08]: Because aren't these supposed to be some huge multiplayer matches?

57:45.696 --> 57:49.117
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have one person that's far away like that, it would cause a tremendous amount of lag.

57:49.137 --> 57:55.178
[SPEAKER_07]: They were saying that it's just a save on server strain, you know, because Army Two is going to be the uber awesome game or something, so, you know.

57:57.279 --> 57:57.619
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it

57:58.418 --> 57:58.779
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

57:58.979 --> 58:05.704
[SPEAKER_08]: I still wish they would leave that option open, but maybe it's not the default way to assign the players.

58:06.945 --> 58:11.729
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you really wanted to play against somebody in the UK or overseas, whatever, you should be able to.

58:12.310 --> 58:12.870
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just EA.

58:12.890 --> 58:13.471
[SPEAKER_07]: It's broken.

58:13.991 --> 58:14.412
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

58:16.153 --> 58:17.374
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope this isn't a trend.

58:17.894 --> 58:18.735
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I have to say.

58:20.356 --> 58:22.438
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can hope not.

58:23.059 --> 58:23.239
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

58:24.654 --> 58:38.965
[SPEAKER_05]: For fans of PopCap, there's actually going to be a PopCap Hits release, a second one actually, that's going to have Heavy Weapon and Zuma on PS2 on a single disc.

58:40.566 --> 58:42.968
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you like your casual games, you can get that.

58:43.008 --> 58:44.109
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine it's going to be dirt cheap.

58:44.429 --> 58:44.109
$20.

58:44.469 --> 58:46.050
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not bad.

58:46.070 --> 58:46.050
$19.95.

58:46.651 --> 58:48.772
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about the same price you'd pay for them on Xbox Live.

58:48.992 --> 58:49.213
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

58:49.893 --> 58:52.335
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you can probably play them free online, but hey.

58:53.649 --> 58:54.630
[SPEAKER_08]: I like anything with weapon in the title.

59:13.604 --> 59:14.765
[SPEAKER_08]: P2P Network Play, not Servers Interesting

59:41.947 --> 59:43.808
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the phones.

59:43.848 --> 59:49.190
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to give us a call, again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

59:49.230 --> 59:51.231
[SPEAKER_08]: The phone lines are now open.

59:52.791 --> 59:53.371
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us a call.

59:53.932 --> 59:54.492
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be waiting.

59:55.752 --> 59:57.113
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, we have a... Oh, we got a call.

59:57.953 --> 59:58.934
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

59:58.954 --> 59:59.294
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

01:00:00.754 --> 01:00:01.054
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hi.

01:00:01.094 --> 01:00:02.495
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Ross DLUT.

01:00:02.595 --> 01:00:03.615
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hello, Ross DLUT.

01:00:03.655 --> 01:00:04.116
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:06.777
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, one thing.

01:00:06.797 --> 01:00:07.957
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go about...

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:17.023
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go back to Microsoft's decision about not supporting Blu-ray and touting their online service.

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:22.784
[SPEAKER_11]: I really think they're limiting their potential audience by doing that, honestly.

01:00:23.705 --> 01:00:34.728
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, since, like it or not, a whole lot of Americans either can't or don't want to download movies, especially on their shitty-ass DRM service.

01:00:35.919 --> 01:00:39.161
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, I got to ask, what is it about Microsoft Service you don't like?

01:00:40.602 --> 01:00:43.324
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think I told you about what happened to me with my XBLA games.

01:00:44.385 --> 01:00:47.547
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you had to send your thing back, you had to re-download them all and all that?

01:00:48.968 --> 01:00:57.554
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to re-download them again, then I had to, well, I didn't have to re-download them, but the way the DRM works is that you can't access your content offline.

01:00:58.004 --> 01:00:59.364
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if your internet goes on the fritz.

01:00:59.545 --> 01:01:00.125
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, that's right.

01:01:01.865 --> 01:01:04.026
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard common problems about that.

01:01:04.386 --> 01:01:06.067
[SPEAKER_08]: And the same goes for movies, basically.

01:01:06.887 --> 01:01:07.967
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, movies.

01:01:08.347 --> 01:01:10.588
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, movies, you don't even get to keep the movies.

01:01:10.608 --> 01:01:14.249
[SPEAKER_11]: You can only watch them once.

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:18.791
[SPEAKER_11]: And no, Ranma, the PlayStation Network isn't anywhere near as draconian.

01:01:18.831 --> 01:01:25.073
[SPEAKER_11]: You can activate up to five systems and it's not anywhere near as hard to get things revalidated.

01:01:25.413 --> 01:01:26.614
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to hurt them in the long run.

01:01:26.634 --> 01:01:31.596
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what we forget being in cities, you know, you're in Sacramento, I'm in Miami, I'm sure a lot of the people in the chat are from decent sized cities, is that

01:01:55.493 --> 01:02:07.198
[SPEAKER_11]: Large parts of the country, especially the further west you go until you get to California, broadband isn't as easily available or it's very expensive.

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:13.300
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only that, but most people are going to have common customer-grade DSL.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.282
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to be paying $80 a month for the high-end stuff, you know what I mean?

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:21.770
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still doing well here in Miami.

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:24.230
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a blockbuster right in front of my house.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.231
[SPEAKER_08]: That place is always doing great business.

01:02:26.251 --> 01:02:29.892
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still doing well in cities.

01:02:40.839 --> 01:02:42.601
[SPEAKER_08]: You still don't see the mom and pop stores anymore.

01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:48.126
[SPEAKER_08]: My very first job was at a mom and pop video game store, and they went under years ago.

01:02:48.626 --> 01:02:53.550
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that has more to do with the chains bullying everybody out than anything else.

01:02:54.651 --> 01:02:57.194
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a whole other issue we could spend a whole show doing.

01:02:57.494 --> 01:03:02.398
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just say, though, we had one thing that Hollywood and Blockbuster and all them didn't have.

01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:03.219
[SPEAKER_08]: We rented porn.

01:03:04.136 --> 01:03:06.437
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, how they went out of business on their own.

01:03:06.457 --> 01:03:10.980
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you still see places that run porn, West Coast and things like that, you know, chains here in the Southeast.

01:03:12.261 --> 01:03:17.664
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, when you go download only, you're limiting yourself.

01:03:17.704 --> 01:03:27.791
[SPEAKER_11]: Because let's face it, if you want to download something other than a damn, than a damn, well, Actdeft is saying it pretty much.

01:03:27.851 --> 01:03:30.192
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, one megabit connection is 40 bucks.

01:03:32.604 --> 01:03:35.706
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not going to get you a high-definition movie in a reasonable amount of time.

01:03:35.986 --> 01:03:42.749
[SPEAKER_11]: I go to Xbox Live Arcade, it takes like an hour to download a movie.

01:03:43.009 --> 01:03:50.092
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, if I'm understanding you right, the downloading thing doesn't do a lot for our need-it-now kind of culture, the self-gratification culture that we live in.

01:03:50.112 --> 01:03:56.975
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why Blockbuster and all that do well is because when somebody thinks, I want to rent a movie, they want to rent a movie tonight, now.

01:03:57.155 --> 01:03:58.536
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want to wait for Netflix.

01:03:58.596 --> 01:03:59.776
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want to wait to download it.

01:04:00.116 --> 01:04:00.857
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to go get it now.

01:04:01.721 --> 01:04:02.801
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, even Netflix.

01:04:02.861 --> 01:04:08.223
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you keep a steady queue, you always have a movie or two there.

01:04:08.283 --> 01:04:08.723
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

01:04:08.943 --> 01:04:12.524
[SPEAKER_08]: But what if the one that's at your house isn't necessarily... And don't get me wrong.

01:04:12.544 --> 01:04:13.164
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Netflix.

01:04:13.204 --> 01:04:14.144
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just being devil's advocate.

01:04:14.445 --> 01:04:20.386
[SPEAKER_08]: What if the one at your house right now isn't the one that you end up wanting to watch when you're talking about with friends?

01:04:20.786 --> 01:04:23.847
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you're talking about an old classic 80s movie that none of you has.

01:04:23.987 --> 01:04:27.448
[SPEAKER_11]: At the end of the day, you get in the car and you go to Blockbuster.

01:04:27.508 --> 01:04:28.829
[SPEAKER_11]: You get in the car or...

01:04:31.251 --> 01:04:35.853
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're lucky enough like I am, you walk across the street and there's your blog post, so you pick up your movie.

01:04:36.253 --> 01:04:40.195
[SPEAKER_11]: And with Blu-ray, you're going to be able to do that.

01:04:40.235 --> 01:04:46.217
[SPEAKER_11]: In the coming months, we already have Blu-ray for rental in my place, and you're going to see that all over the place.

01:04:46.237 --> 01:04:49.618
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to see Blu-ray rentals all over the place, and it's just going to take over.

01:04:49.639 --> 01:04:51.739
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, we'll see.

01:04:51.819 --> 01:04:53.140
[SPEAKER_08]: Ross, to you too, we've got to wrap up.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:53.940
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting towards time.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:55.281
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other last-minute thoughts?

01:04:56.821 --> 01:04:58.262
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, one last-minute thing.

01:04:59.165 --> 01:05:01.587
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised you guys didn't talk about the NPDs this month.

01:05:02.628 --> 01:05:03.508
[SPEAKER_08]: What specifically about them?

01:05:04.669 --> 01:05:13.155
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the PS3 outsold the 360 for the second month in a row, selling 281,000 units versus 255.

01:05:13.955 --> 01:05:16.497
[SPEAKER_11]: But what really surprised me was how well the PS2 did.

01:05:17.137 --> 01:05:18.378
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you saw this.

01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:19.859
[SPEAKER_11]: It sold 352,000.

01:05:22.199 --> 01:05:23.981
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty typical for the PS2.

01:05:24.081 --> 01:05:30.810
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually the matching... I was about to say, I mean, doesn't everybody have... It's still the spare bedroom system.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:35.655
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the system you buy for the younger kids so they can feel cool because they have a video gaming system in their room.

01:05:35.695 --> 01:05:41.743
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think most folks like us that listen to programs like this, yeah, we all have PS2s at this point, but...

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:43.356
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just us.

01:05:43.396 --> 01:05:46.177
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the system's already sold 50 million in America alone.

01:05:46.658 --> 01:05:51.879
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other reason that the PS3 outsold the 360 is because the 360 is in a shortage right now.

01:05:52.539 --> 01:05:53.740
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, please.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.621
[SPEAKER_11]: Every store I go to, there's a ton of 360s.

01:05:56.641 --> 01:05:57.421
[SPEAKER_11]: Microsoft's making them.

01:05:57.441 --> 01:06:01.582
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know because I talked to Microsoft that there's a fucking shortage going on right now.

01:06:01.802 --> 01:06:04.543
[SPEAKER_07]: And they, in fact, commented, yeah, there is a shortage going on right now.

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:06.504
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that the PlayStation 3 is going to outsell us.

01:06:07.526 --> 01:06:09.428
[SPEAKER_07]: And sure enough, then that's not just damage control?

01:06:09.828 --> 01:06:15.953
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not damage control, because they're going to have enough... Oh, right, yeah, okay, I'm sure.

01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:19.255
[SPEAKER_08]: All of a sudden, Blu-ray wins now, and they're going to sell billions of systems.

01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:26.621
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, I was kind of thinking, like, couldn't the possibility, because now that Blu-ray's won the war, so to speak, maybe that moves some PS3s?

01:06:26.641 --> 01:06:27.382
[SPEAKER_07]: Not going to fucking happen.

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:32.245
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you anything in April that the 360's definitely going to outsell the PS3, and buy a lot.

01:06:32.626 --> 01:06:33.586
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of bet?

01:06:35.268 --> 01:06:35.608
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

01:06:36.966 --> 01:06:37.827
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:06:37.967 --> 01:06:46.772
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not so much just Blu-ray, but ever since we saw the system go down to 399 with the 40 gig, you know, the sales have picked up.

01:06:47.793 --> 01:06:49.634
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and Sony's really confident on that.

01:06:49.654 --> 01:06:50.174
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

01:06:50.234 --> 01:06:53.717
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now they're removing the Blu-ray movie that comes with it because they're, guess what?

01:06:53.737 --> 01:06:55.278
[SPEAKER_07]: You fuckers will buy your own Blu-ray.

01:06:55.298 --> 01:06:56.819
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I gotta wrap it up, you guys.

01:06:57.039 --> 01:07:02.822
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm supposed to keep it to four minutes and we're on seven, but Ross Steel, UT, thank you for your perspective as always.

01:07:02.863 --> 01:07:03.403
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, buddy.

01:07:04.105 --> 01:07:04.645
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, bye-bye.

01:07:04.665 --> 01:07:04.945
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:38.486
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Actdeft.

01:07:38.686 --> 01:07:39.407
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Actdeft.

01:07:39.447 --> 01:07:40.008
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind?

01:07:40.168 --> 01:07:44.052
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I just wanted to comment about Video Games Live.

01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:45.534
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

01:07:45.554 --> 01:07:46.055
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to go.

01:07:46.876 --> 01:07:48.958
[SPEAKER_08]: The concert just happened in Mexico recently, right?

01:07:49.639 --> 01:07:49.900
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:50.961
[SPEAKER_08]: And how was it?

01:07:52.717 --> 01:07:55.959
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was so fucking epic and amazing.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.421
[SPEAKER_01]: It was everything I expected and more.

01:08:00.522 --> 01:08:06.185
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pretty amazing, how do you say it, show.

01:08:06.986 --> 01:08:08.787
[SPEAKER_08]: Describe for us the best part.

01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:13.890
[SPEAKER_01]: I seriously can't choose a best part.

01:08:14.902 --> 01:08:24.228
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to choose a song they played, maybe it was the Kingdom Hearts theme song, Simple and Clean, in orchestra.

01:08:24.428 --> 01:08:26.369
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was so fucking amazing.

01:08:26.889 --> 01:08:29.931
[SPEAKER_08]: You sound like you were blown away.

01:08:31.632 --> 01:08:33.513
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost cried at that part.

01:08:34.494 --> 01:08:36.195
[SPEAKER_08]: How was the audience?

01:08:36.275 --> 01:08:37.516
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there a lot of people there?

01:08:37.556 --> 01:08:38.976
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it a very full house?

01:08:40.958 --> 01:08:42.959
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not a full house, though...

01:08:44.054 --> 01:08:50.195
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of people, though it was not full.

01:08:50.215 --> 01:08:51.256
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, not too bad, though.

01:08:51.276 --> 01:08:54.356
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a pretty filled-up crowd, if nothing else.

01:09:11.393 --> 01:09:13.734
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they give an indication that they might come back?

01:09:14.294 --> 01:09:17.336
[SPEAKER_08]: This might just be the first of several shows in Mexico?

01:09:18.937 --> 01:09:26.061
[SPEAKER_01]: They said in a conference before that they may, or most probably, will come next year again.

01:09:26.581 --> 01:09:26.941
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nice.

01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:28.122
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you're excited about that.

01:09:28.843 --> 01:09:29.883
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pretty excited.

01:09:30.523 --> 01:09:34.666
[SPEAKER_08]: Any advice you would have to give to folks that are going to be attending future video game live shows?

01:09:36.107 --> 01:09:36.287
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:38.106
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much that.

01:09:38.446 --> 01:09:42.269
[SPEAKER_01]: Any seat in the concert will give you a pretty good view.

01:09:42.629 --> 01:09:46.572
[SPEAKER_01]: Though on the front will be a pretty good show.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.058
[SPEAKER_08]: ActDev, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:10:14.288 --> 01:10:16.569
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an article on Joystick.

01:10:17.609 --> 01:10:20.490
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a report on Mexican gaming industry.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:31.212
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that by 2010, the gaming industry in Mexico will increase by approximately, I think, 10 million?

01:10:32.112 --> 01:10:33.253
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 billion, excuse me.

01:10:34.513 --> 01:10:42.235
[SPEAKER_01]: So, apparently it's going to be increasing, though I find it kind of ironic that

01:10:43.183 --> 01:10:53.812
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though the analysts think that it's going to increase in the economy, Mexico is one of the leading markets in the world of piracy.

01:10:54.993 --> 01:10:59.236
[SPEAKER_01]: Games, music, movies, you name it.

01:11:01.818 --> 01:11:08.624
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how the industry will manage to beat that.

01:11:10.791 --> 01:11:14.775
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting perspective from somebody who's actually there in Mexico.

01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:17.537
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we read these stories and we don't really know what is it.

01:11:17.617 --> 01:11:22.321
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess my question for you is, what is the gaming... Actually, let me ask you this.

01:11:22.381 --> 01:11:24.623
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever visited the U.S.?

01:11:25.845 --> 01:11:26.745
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have.

01:11:27.306 --> 01:11:34.232
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you been able to compare the availability and the prevalence of gaming here in the U.S.

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:35.133
[SPEAKER_08]: versus Mexico?

01:11:35.153 --> 01:11:35.193
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:11:36.676 --> 01:11:43.399
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like in the United States, you have GameStop, BB Games, many video game stores here.

01:11:43.979 --> 01:11:53.943
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have maybe one or two game stores, and they're only located on the southern region of the country.

01:11:54.703 --> 01:12:02.966
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stores that carry games are like supermarkets, like Walmart, for example.

01:12:04.148 --> 01:12:09.573
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't have a great library of games so it's pretty difficult to find a game you like.

01:12:10.094 --> 01:12:11.455
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do you get your games from?

01:12:12.956 --> 01:12:28.791
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually get my games from Sam's Club because they are pretty cheap and they have a great library there so I'm kind of liking that but anywhere else I go I cannot find anything so I actually have to...

01:12:30.052 --> 01:12:35.616
[SPEAKER_01]: Get my games for them online, or I have to ask friends that go to the United States to get them for me.

01:12:35.836 --> 01:12:36.416
[SPEAKER_08]: To get them for you.

01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:43.181
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thankfully, they run on the same televisions, and pretty much the Xboxes you get there are the same ones here, so you don't have to worry about those region-based issues.

01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:49.445
[SPEAKER_08]: Always interesting to hear from our listeners in other countries and kind of hear about the way the scene is there, so thanks so much.

01:12:49.725 --> 01:12:54.328
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to let you go, Actdeft, because we're running out of time, but thank you very much for the call.

01:12:55.428 --> 01:12:56.089
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you, too.

01:12:56.269 --> 01:12:56.669
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:58.730
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do one more call.

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:00.850
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see who gets through here.

01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:02.371
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do some last-minute stories.

01:13:02.391 --> 01:13:04.372
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any last-minute stories for us, Loki, when we get to that?

01:13:04.932 --> 01:13:05.052
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:13:05.352 --> 01:13:05.692
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:13:05.833 --> 01:13:06.293
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

01:13:06.313 --> 01:13:08.073
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you go ahead and read us the first one?

01:13:08.474 --> 01:13:09.074
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, never mind.

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:09.494
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a call.

01:13:11.055 --> 01:13:12.155
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:12.175 --> 01:13:12.535
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Orange Lounge.

01:13:15.437 --> 01:13:24.060
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the, what is it, the Norwegian, no, Norwegian, Swedish owl known as Akeripper.

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.601
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hello, Akeripper.

01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:28.182
[SPEAKER_08]: I see you in chat right now.

01:13:28.906 --> 01:13:30.647
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember you calling in before.

01:13:30.787 --> 01:13:31.527
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing?

01:13:32.528 --> 01:13:33.448
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing just fine.

01:13:33.508 --> 01:13:37.890
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm, well, what, doing my WoW drugs as usual, so.

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:39.551
[SPEAKER_08]: What time is it?

01:13:39.771 --> 01:13:42.052
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to be like, what, four or five in the morning over there?

01:13:43.613 --> 01:13:51.356
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what is it, five, five to, ah, I don't, damn, I'm lost in time.

01:13:53.327 --> 01:13:55.351
[SPEAKER_06]: It's around like 5 o'clock in the morning.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.695
[SPEAKER_08]: He's up so late he lost complete track of time.

01:13:57.735 --> 01:13:58.536
[SPEAKER_08]: That's dedication.

01:13:58.596 --> 01:13:58.997
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

01:13:59.257 --> 01:13:59.978
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what's on your mind?

01:14:00.179 --> 01:14:01.421
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we owe the phone call tonight?

01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:03.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, what is it?

01:14:04.054 --> 01:14:10.397
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in the plans of buying a PSP for some weird reason, and I don't even know why.

01:14:10.557 --> 01:14:24.845
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason is that I want to do a homebrew on it, and I try to do some read-up on it on the web, and I'm completely lost on that for some weird reason.

01:14:24.945 --> 01:14:27.166
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know why, but, well...

01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:40.448
[SPEAKER_06]: And since Loki has made his homebrewed PSP, I think, if I remember right, I want to ask him, what is...

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:45.363
[SPEAKER_06]: What is, does he have any kind of tip or so?

01:14:45.784 --> 01:14:46.324
[SPEAKER_08]: Good question.

01:14:46.364 --> 01:14:49.227
[SPEAKER_08]: What is kind of the best way if you're interested in doing some homebrew on the PSP?

01:14:49.247 --> 01:14:51.448
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the best way to do that if you don't already own a PSP?

01:14:52.089 --> 01:15:02.357
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not very easy because, especially with the new slim PSPs now, if you're getting one of the fatter ones, it's easy to do it because all you have to really do is, you know, downgrade the...

01:15:04.174 --> 01:15:08.095
[SPEAKER_07]: using any sort of exploit, either the Pandora's Battery or Grand Theft Auto.

01:15:08.615 --> 01:15:09.295
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me say this first.

01:15:09.335 --> 01:15:14.776
[SPEAKER_08]: I think part of the reason it's so complicated is because of the fact that Sony keeps patching it with every exploit that's found.

01:15:15.156 --> 01:15:17.317
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like there's 50 different ways to do it out there.

01:15:18.017 --> 01:15:31.600
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the reasons also is that there is actually a place where you can buy a homebrew-enabled PSP for...

01:15:32.444 --> 01:15:32.625
[SPEAKER_06]: and more.

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:56.643
[SPEAKER_06]: and well, since I'm a sheep bastard, I have the intention of just buying the vanilla and then try to make some homebrew version.

01:15:56.943 --> 01:15:59.064
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't blame you.

01:15:59.164 --> 01:16:10.348
[SPEAKER_07]: There's guides online to do the slim PSP, but what it's going to really take is you need to have someone else that has one of the original PSPs or has already made a Pandora's battery for the slim one.

01:16:10.368 --> 01:16:14.670
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically what you do, you'd have to have the old one to create the Pandora's battery.

01:16:15.191 --> 01:16:18.772
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you patch it for the slim one, and then you run it on your slim.

01:16:18.992 --> 01:16:23.334
[SPEAKER_08]: Should he try his luck and try to go buy a used PSP?

01:16:23.594 --> 01:16:30.616
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think the cheapest way to do it, try your luck in buying a used PSP, because a used PSP is likely to have an older firmware still on it.

01:16:31.136 --> 01:16:31.517
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:49.459
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of.

01:16:49.519 --> 01:16:54.321
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy the... Okay, really quickly, what is the Pandora's Battery?

01:16:54.441 --> 01:17:01.743
[SPEAKER_07]: Pandora's Battery is basically you're running firmware or actual code off the battery because the battery itself actually has a little bit of data on it.

01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:08.885
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what that does is it pops it into a developer's mode and drops the firmware to whatever.

01:17:08.905 --> 01:17:11.545
[SPEAKER_07]: It basically resets the whole PSP.

01:17:12.326 --> 01:17:13.966
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they've done is kind of boot...

01:17:14.465 --> 01:17:38.919
[SPEAKER_07]: Bootstrapped a downgrader with this Pandora's battery so it's allowed them to you know drop it down to 1.5 and then once you have 1.5 you can up it to you know a custom firmware or something like that it's not easy and it's pretty confusing but there are guides that take you step by step on how to do it QJNet has a pretty good guide and stuff or at least you know

01:17:39.511 --> 01:17:42.032
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd have links to find a guide like that.

01:17:42.532 --> 01:17:44.813
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to ask, are there any sites that you would recommend?

01:17:45.053 --> 01:17:55.737
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it sounds like... Probably like PSP Hacks or PSP.QJ.net or I think PSPUpdates.QJ.net They would have links.

01:17:55.757 --> 01:17:59.318
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I found mine, but it's been a long time since I did it.

01:17:59.619 --> 01:18:06.861
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you do get a custom firmware on there, it's pretty easy because now the stuff that they put out, I guess it's the M33 firmwares,

01:18:09.432 --> 01:18:11.354
[SPEAKER_07]: They're completely easy to upgrade.

01:18:11.394 --> 01:18:20.361
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, now they've got it built in where you can just run an update via Wi-Fi and update it over the web just like you would a normal PSP.

01:18:21.983 --> 01:18:26.407
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty simple once you've got that working to get a homebrew on there.

01:18:26.447 --> 01:18:29.389
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just getting it to that is pretty hard.

01:18:29.489 --> 01:18:35.054
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily, I had two PSPs, so I just used my old one to create the Pandora's Battery to do it.

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.020
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

01:18:38.621 --> 01:18:39.501
[SPEAKER_06]: What is more?

01:18:39.901 --> 01:18:43.903
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but in that way, that was just about what we were going to ask also.

01:18:44.023 --> 01:18:56.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you can actually buy one with custom firmware already on it, how will it work when you're going to have to do updates and stuff?

01:18:58.028 --> 01:18:58.848
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?

01:18:58.988 --> 01:18:59.189
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, not...

01:19:03.453 --> 01:19:11.915
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh damn, I lost the name of the game, but not LocoRoco, but the other one that's coming.

01:19:12.835 --> 01:19:13.496
[SPEAKER_06]: Patapon?

01:19:13.736 --> 01:19:14.556
[SPEAKER_06]: Patapon and stuff?

01:19:14.956 --> 01:19:26.319
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, what the thing is, what you're going to have to do, obviously you can't use any updates that are on UMD disk, because that will corrupt your firmware, but what you're going to have to do is just wait for them to release these updates.

01:19:27.127 --> 01:19:31.429
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily though, most of the firmwares are cracked within like a day or two at the most.

01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:38.553
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's kind of the sad part though, is that if you want to do homebrew on the PSP, it's at the point now where you have to be pretty, you know, on top of it to do it.

01:19:38.633 --> 01:19:44.696
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, and here's something to consider, is that yeah, Loki might be a sort of homebrew PSP expert, but Loki, how many PSPs do you own?

01:19:45.157 --> 01:19:45.417
[SPEAKER_08]: Two.

01:19:45.857 --> 01:19:47.998
[SPEAKER_08]: And one is for homebrew and one is for current stuff, right?

01:19:48.018 --> 01:19:48.518
[SPEAKER_08]: Or something like that?

01:19:48.638 --> 01:19:48.799
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:19:49.119 --> 01:19:49.959
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought that's how you did it.

01:19:50.059 --> 01:19:52.741
[SPEAKER_07]: One I just don't use and it's collecting dust and it's one of the older ones.

01:19:52.781 --> 01:19:53.461
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other one is,

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:56.524
[SPEAKER_07]: I can play new games on it, and I can play Homebrew on it.

01:19:56.684 --> 01:19:57.044
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

01:19:58.105 --> 01:19:58.845
[SPEAKER_07]: The Slims, yeah.

01:19:58.885 --> 01:20:00.967
[SPEAKER_07]: And you did the Pandora's Battery trick with it.

01:20:01.067 --> 01:20:01.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:20:01.888 --> 01:20:02.188
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:20:02.368 --> 01:20:03.449
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a pain in the ass, though.

01:20:03.609 --> 01:20:05.690
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really not fun.

01:20:06.411 --> 01:20:13.716
[SPEAKER_07]: And luckily, I had an extra battery I bought, because I bought a charger, a new charger for it, and it came with a battery, so I used that battery.

01:20:14.456 --> 01:20:22.702
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I think I still have my Pandora's Battery, but the thing is, also, when you're doing the Slim, the patched one does not fit on a 32-meg memory stick.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:32.029
[SPEAKER_07]: So you need to make sure you have at least one that's like 128 to be able to put the data on it because you have to have a memory stick and a battery that are basically linked together.

01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:37.795
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what will happen is when you pop that battery in, it will run that data that's on that memory stick for you.

01:20:38.371 --> 01:20:40.211
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really weird.

01:20:40.271 --> 01:20:49.473
[SPEAKER_06]: A memory card is not going to be a problem since I actually have two memory sticks and I actually plan to buy an 8GB version if I'm going to buy a PSP.

01:20:49.653 --> 01:20:50.794
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's fine.

01:20:51.334 --> 01:21:06.777
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you buy, say, another battery or something, what will happen is once you've created it as a Pandora's battery, you can backup your battery data so that you can drop that battery back to a normal battery after it's done.

01:21:07.105 --> 01:21:08.066
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of complicated.

01:21:08.086 --> 01:21:09.667
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of stuff on the internet.

01:21:09.947 --> 01:21:16.652
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I don't remember exactly the steps to go to do it, but the information is definitely out there.

01:21:17.232 --> 01:21:18.533
[SPEAKER_07]: One last question, though.

01:21:18.553 --> 01:21:21.495
[SPEAKER_06]: About playing with your PSP Slim on a big screen, how does that work?

01:21:21.515 --> 01:21:23.797
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the Slim ones, you just need to buy a cable to do it, and...

01:21:37.439 --> 01:21:40.160
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much it just involves you plugging it in.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.220
[SPEAKER_07]: The only problem is you're tethered to your TV.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.061
[SPEAKER_07]: Any extension or something like that?

01:21:46.221 --> 01:21:50.142
[SPEAKER_07]: Any extension cable for component or composite will work.

01:21:50.262 --> 01:21:53.543
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just you're still tethered via cord.

01:21:54.123 --> 01:21:59.624
[SPEAKER_07]: Although now they have a thing where they're going to come out with a remote dock if they're watching UMD movies or something like that.

01:21:59.824 --> 01:22:04.285
[SPEAKER_07]: You can control it with a remote, but still, though, it's going to be tethered to your TV.

01:22:05.293 --> 01:22:07.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Aki Ripper, you're right, I've got to wrap things up.

01:22:07.396 --> 01:22:09.579
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any other quick final thoughts?

01:22:10.701 --> 01:22:13.625
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, not that I'm so...

01:22:15.207 --> 01:22:32.522
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a bit annoyed, just waiting for 2.4 patch to come out, since apparently you can start downloading the whole thing, so what is it, on Tuesday or Wednesday, it's going to apparently be patched to 2.4?

01:22:32.622 --> 01:22:41.609
[SPEAKER_08]: The background downloader is already active, my 2.4 is downloaded, I'm pretty sure it'll go live either this Tuesday or next Tuesday, but we'll see, and of course we're talking about Warcraft, if you're wondering where.

01:22:42.651 --> 01:22:45.092
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, real quick, you said you were from Sweden?

01:22:45.933 --> 01:22:46.173
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:22:46.373 --> 01:22:48.174
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, you know what I love most about Sweden?

01:22:49.514 --> 01:22:51.135
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, our royal house?

01:22:51.475 --> 01:22:52.015
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

01:22:54.296 --> 01:22:54.616
[SPEAKER_08]: ABBA.

01:23:00.218 --> 01:23:01.519
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't stop, I love the music.

01:23:01.559 --> 01:23:03.820
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we seriously gotta let you go.

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:06.241
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I can't say...

01:23:06.989 --> 01:23:07.730
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I know.

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:10.052
[SPEAKER_08]: That was how many years ago, but it's timeless.

01:23:10.312 --> 01:23:11.353
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, have a good one, buddy.

01:23:11.533 --> 01:23:11.913
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

01:23:12.373 --> 01:23:13.174
[SPEAKER_08]: Same to you, too.

01:23:13.214 --> 01:23:13.534
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

01:23:14.535 --> 01:23:16.637
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, the chat room's all, not ABBA.

01:23:18.398 --> 01:23:20.059
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob went there.

01:23:20.159 --> 01:23:21.040
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes, I went there.

01:23:25.243 --> 01:23:26.985
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

01:23:27.025 --> 01:23:28.106
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to wrap up this show.

01:23:28.846 --> 01:23:29.427
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

01:23:29.467 --> 01:23:30.127
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Jamie.

01:23:31.308 --> 01:23:32.689
[SPEAKER_08]: But ABBA, Jamie, ABBA.

01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:35.872
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when you were all antsy about getting to see Mamma Mia.

01:23:37.529 --> 01:23:38.770
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, the movie is coming out.

01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:39.450
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what.

01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:40.031
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited.

01:23:40.071 --> 01:23:40.351
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:23:40.491 --> 01:23:41.151
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go see it.

01:23:41.972 --> 01:23:42.232
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:23:42.252 --> 01:23:42.992
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to wrap up.

01:23:43.032 --> 01:23:44.473
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get everybody's final thought.

01:23:44.513 --> 01:23:46.234
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you got like your keys in your hand.

01:23:46.274 --> 01:23:46.895
[SPEAKER_08]: You ready to roll?

01:23:46.915 --> 01:23:49.837
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm trying to get to my thing so I can give you my Cage Match song.

01:23:49.877 --> 01:23:50.457
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

01:23:50.477 --> 01:23:51.438
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your final thought today?

01:23:52.038 --> 01:23:55.100
[SPEAKER_05]: Reject false icons and buy me a fucking computer.

01:23:56.241 --> 01:23:58.102
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is Heartburn sucks.

01:23:58.202 --> 01:23:59.022
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought?

01:24:00.103 --> 01:24:03.305
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is... I don't know.

01:24:03.345 --> 01:24:05.466
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to add people on Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:24:06.407 --> 01:24:06.487
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

01:24:07.481 --> 01:24:09.122
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:24:37.844 --> 01:24:43.369
[SPEAKER_07]: The trick is to make stuff that looks like other things from like, you know, pixel art type stuff.

01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:46.612
[SPEAKER_07]: Levels that look like, you know, mine was the question block level.

01:24:46.852 --> 01:24:48.814
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like a question block from Mario Brothers.

01:24:48.934 --> 01:24:49.375
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:50.716
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:24:51.178 --> 01:24:53.219
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one other final thought for you guys.

01:24:53.279 --> 01:24:59.683
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, but before we get to that, I just want to say thank you so much as always for tuning into and downloading and supporting independent podcasting.

01:25:00.023 --> 01:25:04.365
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, if you like Orange Launch Radio, all we ask, tell a friend or two about our show, spread the word.

01:25:04.965 --> 01:25:06.666
[SPEAKER_08]: It's how we slowly take over the world.

01:25:07.107 --> 01:25:11.149
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll leave you with one last final, final thought and then say goodnight.

01:25:11.409 --> 01:25:11.689
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodnight.

01:25:23.956 --> 01:25:25.637
[SPEAKER_08]: That music will never ever get old.

01:25:25.677 --> 01:25:26.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray sure did a good cover.

01:25:26.717 --> 01:25:27.718
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care what you say.

01:25:30.999 --> 01:25:31.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys again.

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:32.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great week.
