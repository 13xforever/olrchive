00:15.300 --> 00:19.800
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.800 --> 00:24.300
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 16th of 2008.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.500
Happy St. Patrick's Day Eve to those of you out there.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.000
Don't forget to wear green tomorrow, or don't forget to wear green three days ago

00:31.000 --> 00:33.200
if you're listening on the podcast because you guys get a little late.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.300
But hey, that's just part of the perks of listening live to us every Sunday night

00:36.300 --> 00:39.000
when we tape over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.800
We have a chat room full of people who are doing that right now.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.300
And for all you guys, whether it be live, syndicated, or podcast,

00:46.300 --> 00:48.800
we're going to get back into the gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

00:48.800 --> 00:49.400
Yes.

00:49.400 --> 00:53.600
And if you live in the United States, you're probably looking forward to some pretty cool games

00:53.600 --> 00:57.300
coming out into the arcade, like Tekken 6.

00:57.300 --> 01:02.600
You're never going to get to play Tekken 6 because it's never coming to the arcade in the U.S.

01:02.600 --> 01:08.900
So if you want to play in the arcade, got to go to Japan or hopefully find an arcade that will import it for you.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.000
So that kind of sucks.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.900
Of which there are a few of those kind of places.

01:11.900 --> 01:15.000
Like I think of that one place we always used to go to in L.A.

01:15.000 --> 01:15.600
Yeah.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.400
What was that, Arcade Infinity? Is that what it's called?

01:17.400 --> 01:17.800
Yeah.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.700
Apparently there are a few places that are importing them.

01:21.700 --> 01:25.800
There's a place in Houston, I guess, that also has a Tekken 6 machine.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.300
But they're not going to be widely available like, you know, most fighting games are.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.700
Go to an Amco arcade, they'll have it.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.900
You think?

01:33.900 --> 01:39.300
I'm pretty sure, because when I worked for Aladdin's Castle and Cyberstation,

01:39.300 --> 01:43.200
we had like the super deluxe Tekken, this is when Tekken 3 came out.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.500
But we had them well before everybody else did.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.300
But that was a U.S. release, right?

01:47.300 --> 01:52.700
Well, right, but we had them for months before they were allowed in any other arcade.

01:52.700 --> 01:56.900
My curiosity is, though, is I almost wonder if the opposite wouldn't be true,

01:56.900 --> 01:59.500
is that since this game won't come out in the U.S.,

01:59.500 --> 02:02.100
the Namco arcades wouldn't support them.

02:02.100 --> 02:02.600
I don't know.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.500
I would think that they're going to have one or two.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.200
Hmm.

02:06.200 --> 02:11.100
I really think that the bigger Namco locations would have one.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.300
Well, we'll see what happens.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.400
Regardless, that kind of does suck, though.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.100
I mean, to hear that a new Tekken game is coming out in the arcades is not...

02:17.100 --> 02:19.000
That pisses me off!

02:19.000 --> 02:20.100
Well, that's sad.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.700
But that's where arcades are going.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.300
It's not... That shows you how lucrative arcades are right now.

02:24.300 --> 02:24.800
It's sad.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.400
That makes my heart hurt.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Usagi's in chat and says,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.400
Man, I have three gamers in this room with me,

02:32.400 --> 02:35.700
and they all gave me a dirty look when they got the news about Tekken 6.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.300
Sorry, guys. We don't write the news. We just report it.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.300
I would say write your cards and letters to Namco.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.200
Let them know you want to see this game in the U.S.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.000
and that you would spend money on it.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.700
Say Namco, we don't need any more fucking Pac-Man.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.200
Bring us Tekken 6. Thank you.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.100
Yeah, and phrase it just like that and see how far that gets you.

02:54.400 --> 02:54.900
Alright.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.200
That makes me very, very sad.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
I'm sorry, are you going to write a letter?

02:58.700 --> 03:01.500
Are you going to go there and run them over with a tank?

03:01.500 --> 03:02.600
Haha!

03:03.900 --> 03:04.900
Alright.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.800
Moving on to what's hopefully a little bit happier news.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.400
I don't know.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.500
Gran Turismo 5, the prologue version.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.900
Finally, some more information about that for the U.K.

03:14.900 --> 03:17.100
We had some information about the U.S. last week,

03:17.100 --> 03:18.800
but now we have some more information for the U.K.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.100
It's going to be on the European PlayStation Store on March 27th,

03:23.100 --> 03:26.400
followed immediately the very next day by a version on Blu-ray.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.400
So yes, you can buy the prequel to a game that will be coming out on Blu-ray... whatever.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.900
You all know the deal with Gran Turismo 5 prologue at this point.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.800
The game will be coming out on that day,

03:35.800 --> 03:41.000
and the price that you will pay for it is...

03:41.000 --> 03:42.900
£24.99.

03:42.900 --> 03:46.200
That's £24.99 pounds sterling in the U.K.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.100
That's about $50 U.S.

03:49.100 --> 03:52.200
That's just because the U.S. dollar sucks.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.000
I might be at this point. I don't know.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.200
It really is.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.000
That still kind of sucks.

03:57.000 --> 03:57.600
Everyone's like,

03:57.600 --> 03:59.900
Oh, stuff's so much more expensive in the U.K.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.100
No, our dollar just really sucks. That's all.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.900
Also, there's the Europe PS3 bundle.

04:04.900 --> 04:07.500
They're actually getting a bundle that has prologue in it.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.800
£299 for that on March 28th.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.400
We talked about that last week.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.000
That's right.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Just want to remind.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.700
They should have a little underscore on that.

04:16.700 --> 04:17.300
You know, saying,

04:17.300 --> 04:19.600
Get you ready for the full game when it finally comes out,

04:19.600 --> 04:21.000
and we'll sell it to you for $60,

04:21.000 --> 04:22.300
and you'll buy it because you are...

04:22.300 --> 04:26.600
£60, which translates to, you know, $100 American, probably.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.600
So...

04:27.600 --> 04:31.000
Yeah, at that time, it would be like $6 billion American.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.600
Well, for those loyal Tekken fans like me here over in the U.S.,

04:37.600 --> 04:42.900
Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection Online players are going to be getting an update

04:42.900 --> 04:45.700
that allows the DualShock 3 support.

04:45.700 --> 04:46.700
So...

04:46.700 --> 04:47.800
Yay.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.600
It also will have some different online tweaks,

04:51.600 --> 04:54.800
like a one-on-one pickup match,

04:54.800 --> 04:58.800
some updates to the lobby,

04:58.800 --> 05:05.100
and some of your ranking updates, that type of thing.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.300
I'm like, okay.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.600
Well, I guess that's kind of cool.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.400
I mean, you know, considering, you know,

05:10.400 --> 05:13.300
most people were missing Rumble pretty badly,

05:13.300 --> 05:15.700
now the fact that they're going to bring it back, I guess...

05:15.700 --> 05:18.100
I don't know, is it too little, too late, though?

05:18.100 --> 05:18.600
Maybe.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.800
I mean, do you think there'll be a lot of people that go back and say,

05:20.800 --> 05:24.700
oh, I'm going to run back and play Tekken 5 because I can have Rumble now?

05:24.700 --> 05:25.900
It's worth a try,

05:25.900 --> 05:29.100
especially if you don't have to really, you know, pay anything for it.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.700
I don't think anyone's going to really go back and play those games

05:31.700 --> 05:33.200
just because they didn't have Rumble.

05:33.200 --> 05:33.800
You know what, though?

05:33.800 --> 05:35.200
Then again, I think about myself,

05:35.200 --> 05:36.800
and I actually went back and played...

05:36.800 --> 05:38.200
Do you remember that game Crystal Quest

05:38.200 --> 05:40.600
that came out on Xbox Live like a year ago?

05:40.600 --> 05:43.000
You know they did an upgrade to that not that long ago?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.800
They had upgraded a game that added some type of combo meter in it,

05:45.800 --> 05:49.400
so I went back and played the game to see if the combo meter was exciting.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.600
I played about half a game, then I quit.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.900
Because I was like, uh...

05:52.900 --> 05:56.200
This game was much cooler when it was like originally on the Apple in two colors,

05:56.200 --> 05:58.800
white and black.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.900
It lost something along the way, I'm not sure what.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.500
I liked it back when it was on the PC,

06:04.500 --> 06:08.200
in like magenta and cyan, yellow and black.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.500
I never even played the PC version, I always...

06:10.500 --> 06:11.300
Go CGA.

06:11.300 --> 06:14.400
I always thought of it as a Mac game.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.400
Oh, I don't know if it was on the PC, I just, you know, like CGA.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.100
Oh, you made it up.

06:18.100 --> 06:18.600
I made it up.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.200
I see how you are.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.100
See, I'm so cool.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.900
Wasn't there also a CGA like that had like,

06:22.900 --> 06:25.100
I think it was like red, yellow, and green?

06:25.100 --> 06:29.500
Yeah, it was red, yellow, green, and blue, I think.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.400
You either had like, you know, the printer colors,

06:32.400 --> 06:37.000
or like, you know, the crayon colors, I don't know.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.400
But, uh, let's see here.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.900
This week, completely off topic from CGA graphics,

06:41.900 --> 06:43.900
um, Street Fighter IV...

06:43.900 --> 06:45.800
And thank God!

06:45.800 --> 06:47.800
Street Fighter IV, full CGA graphics.

06:47.800 --> 06:52.000
If we were reporting on a new game that supported CGA cutting-edge technology,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I'd be like, wow, that's kind of sad.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.400
You know what I did play once in CGA?

06:56.400 --> 06:57.800
Tangent, tangent!

06:57.800 --> 07:00.900
I played a strip poker game in CGA once.

07:00.900 --> 07:05.900
You remember those old school strip poker games they released for like the old systems?

07:05.900 --> 07:09.900
Like, there was, like, they had strip poker on the Commodore 64 and all that stuff.

07:09.900 --> 07:12.900
It was just basically these really pixelated pictures of women.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.200
You know, they had a CGA version of that.

07:16.200 --> 07:24.800
There was, I don't, I remember that my grandparents or something bought us a Muppets game or something like that.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.500
And we thought it didn't work.

07:26.500 --> 07:31.400
Because the intro screen, or because it was in CGA or whatever,

07:31.400 --> 07:34.100
we couldn't see that it said press any key to continue,

07:34.100 --> 07:36.600
because it was written in black text on black.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.600
So it was like, um, okay.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.600
So finally, like one day, I turned the contrast up all the way.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.200
I'm like, hey, there's something written there!

07:44.200 --> 07:48.500
And then I saw that and I hit the button and, wow, this game sucks!

07:48.500 --> 07:51.000
Uh, and some folks in chat are asking what's CGA.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.200
Again, CGA was the old school, like, PC color graphics adapter,

07:55.200 --> 07:59.200
and it was when your monitors went from being monochromed to four colors.

07:59.200 --> 08:04.200
And you could either have red, green, yellow, and black, or cyan, magenta, uh,

08:04.200 --> 08:06.200
what am I missing?

08:06.200 --> 08:07.200
Yellow?

08:07.200 --> 08:09.200
Yellow and black? No, but it wasn't that though, was it?

08:09.200 --> 08:11.200
White and black. It was cyan, magenta, white, and black.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
Oh, you're right, you're right.

08:12.200 --> 08:18.200
Okay, and then after CGA was EGA, extended graphics adapter, when it went up to 16 colors.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.200
Then we had VGA.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.200
And then VGA, 256.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.200
And then S-VGA.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.200
Super VGA, and pretty much everything you see now is some type of extension.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.200
XGA, yeah.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.200
All that crap, so.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.200
There you have it, a little history lesson from your old friends at Orange Lounge Radio,

08:32.200 --> 08:35.200
your ever-aging friends.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.200
Hey, I remember playing on monochrome.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.200
So anyways, to get back into the story here, um...

08:40.200 --> 08:42.200
Yeah, Street Fighter IV for four colors, right?

08:42.200 --> 08:45.200
Yeah, Street Fighter IV, four color edition.

08:45.200 --> 08:52.200
Um, they're getting a brand new character, a lucha libre wrestler named El Frito, or

08:52.200 --> 08:54.200
Forte, I don't know how you pronounce it.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.200
His name is El Farto?

08:55.200 --> 09:01.200
His name is El Farto. No, I believe it's Ferté? I don't know.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.200
Wasn't that a Howard Stern character, Fartman, or something like that?

09:04.200 --> 09:05.200
Yes, Fartman was a Howard Stern.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.200
Do you think Howard Stern will sue Capcom?

09:07.200 --> 09:08.200
No.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.200
Okay.

09:09.200 --> 09:14.200
No, he should be El Aso Wipo, which would be fucking awesome if that was the case.

09:14.200 --> 09:20.200
Um, but yeah, he is basically, you know, luchador, and, you know, people are kind of comparing

09:20.200 --> 09:23.200
him between, like, Vega and Rey Mysterio.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.200
I don't know.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.200
Looks neat.

09:25.200 --> 09:30.200
I am, I don't know, not that excited about Street Fighter IV, unfortunately.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.200
I was afraid they'd give us Rainbow Mika again.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.200
You know what's funny? I tried, I...

09:37.200 --> 09:43.200
I forced my wife to watch some lucha libre last night, just very briefly, because we

09:43.200 --> 09:47.200
couldn't find anything on TV, so I'm like, okay, lucha libre, I'm gonna turn that on.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.200
Yeah, I don't like it.

09:50.200 --> 09:55.200
RossdielUT in chat says, oh yay, another piss-poor Hispanic stereotype.

09:55.200 --> 10:01.200
Wrong, another piss-poor masked wrestler stereotype.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.200
That's true, if he wears a mask, you don't necessarily know exactly what his name is.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.200
You know what, they just...

10:05.200 --> 10:06.200
He could be Asian.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.200
Or it could be, like, the end of Metroid.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.200
Ooh, a woman.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.200
Who knows?

10:10.200 --> 10:11.200
Here comes the mask.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.200
Holy woman.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.200
Alright, sorry, you had Star Chakra?

10:15.200 --> 10:22.200
I'm just saying, we just need, like, a new All Japan Wrestling game or something.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.200
An All Japan Wrestling game?

10:23.200 --> 10:26.200
Well, this one, the wrestling leagues.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.200
Or did All Japan go, or was it Fire that went out?

10:29.200 --> 10:30.200
Fire Pro.

10:30.200 --> 10:34.200
Fire Pro Wrestling, they actually had a new game that came out last year.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.200
Because I really...

10:35.200 --> 10:36.200
On PlayStation 2.

10:36.200 --> 10:42.200
I really think that, you know, we need to, because a lot of the WWF games that come out,

10:42.200 --> 10:47.200
or WWE games that come out over here, have all of the moves from some of Japan's best

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
wrestlers in it.

10:48.200 --> 10:53.200
I was like, why don't they just do a game called Stereotypical Wrestler the Game?

10:53.200 --> 10:54.200
Awesome.

10:54.200 --> 10:59.200
And have it just be, I mean, and true, you wouldn't have your support of your, you know,

10:59.200 --> 11:03.200
your WWE franchises and all that, but you have all these classic moves and stuff shoved

11:03.200 --> 11:04.200
into it.

11:04.200 --> 11:09.200
And instead of being stuck in, like, 2D fighter, like what was the old WrestleMania that was

11:09.200 --> 11:13.200
out way back in the day, where you could play as The Undertaker back when he was still really

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
cool and not riding a bike.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.200
And who else was in that?

11:18.200 --> 11:20.200
Doink the Clown?

11:20.200 --> 11:22.200
You could play as them.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.200
You know...

11:23.200 --> 11:24.200
I would rather play as Pennywise the Clown.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.200
That would be a video game I would buy.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.200
We all float here.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.200
Anyway.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.200
Anyway.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.200
Kiss me, fat boy.

11:32.200 --> 11:38.200
But, I think that if they're, they should just satisfy the world's apparent need that

11:38.200 --> 11:44.200
they think that we have for, you know, wrestler stereotypes, and just do wrestler stereotype

11:44.200 --> 11:50.200
the game, and have you make whatever you want.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.200
Even better.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.200
I just worry that opens the door to racial stereotype the game, and not going to be a

11:54.200 --> 11:56.200
good thing for video gaming's image.

11:56.200 --> 12:01.200
I want a game that combines wrestling and katamari, so that, like, as you're fighting

12:01.200 --> 12:06.200
them, like, body parts fall off and get stuck on your body, and you're fighting them.

12:06.200 --> 12:10.200
Like, a fighting game where you're fighting, like, tons of people, and then your, like,

12:10.200 --> 12:12.200
character has, like, 50 arms and stuff.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
That'd be pretty cool.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.200
What was that old school game?

12:14.200 --> 12:15.200
Thrill Kill?

12:15.200 --> 12:16.200
Really old school.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.200
Huh?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.200
Not Thrill Kill.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.200
No.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.200
It was, uh, it came out around the time of Mortal Kombat.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.200
Like, it tried to one-up Mortal Kombat.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
Pit Fighter?

12:23.200 --> 12:26.200
And the attack buttons were, like, arm, arm, leg, leg, and head.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.200
And, like, you would chop off limbs, and then the person couldn't use that type of attack

12:30.200 --> 12:31.200
anymore.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.200
CarnEvil?

12:32.200 --> 12:33.200
Was it Time Killers?

12:33.200 --> 12:34.200
Was that what it was?

12:34.200 --> 12:35.200
Time Killers.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.200
Was Time Killers?

12:36.200 --> 12:37.200
Time Killers.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.200
It was, like, not Eternal Champion or something.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.200
No, I'm pretty sure it was Time Killers.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.200
It was Time Killers.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.200
There was a Viking in it.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
I think it was, yeah.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.200
Yeah.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.200
Okay, it was Time Killers.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
Like, there you go.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.200
You should have that game mixed with katamari.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
Time Killers 2.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.200
You know what made me think of Thrill Kill is the character that, um, looks like, uh,

12:50.200 --> 12:55.200
Ken on one side and Ryu on the other side that are both hands, and a torso.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.200
Well, you do-

12:56.200 --> 12:57.200
That's what it made me think of.

12:57.200 --> 13:01.880
You know, spoiler, if you play to the end of Smash Bros. in single-player mode, the

13:01.880 --> 13:04.680
boss is a giant hand, just like the last game.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.440
Because the hand is always there.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.440
Alright.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.360
And I think the hand is really Mickey Mouse.

13:11.360 --> 13:16.400
In other Street Fighter news, if I may, uh, moving on to another anticipated Street Fighter

13:16.400 --> 13:21.360
release is Street Fighter 2 HD, uh, I'm not gonna call the whole thing, it's like, what

13:21.360 --> 13:23.240
is it, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo?

13:23.240 --> 13:25.500
Forget it, it's Street Fighter 2 HD, okay?

13:25.500 --> 13:29.120
This game is coming out, um, soon.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.120
What do you mean it's the happy one?

13:30.120 --> 13:31.760
Is that the one that the art is?

13:31.760 --> 13:36.060
Yes, basically it's, you know, it's Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, but it's all been

13:36.060 --> 13:37.800
completely redone in HD.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.200
By one of my favorite groups of artists.

13:40.200 --> 13:44.120
Yeah, it's gonna be cool, but here's the thing, you can get a sneak peek at it.

13:44.120 --> 13:50.800
In the beta version, uh, if you buy Wolf of the Battlefield Commando 3, which is another

13:50.800 --> 13:58.160
Xbox Live Arcade game, you'll get access to the Super Street Fighter 2 HD game, you get

13:58.160 --> 14:01.720
an access key for the public beta stress test.

14:01.720 --> 14:06.040
Something to note about that though, apparently in the stress test, the rumor is, it's only

14:06.040 --> 14:10.080
Ken, it's only Ryu, and it's only one stage that you can play in.

14:10.080 --> 14:14.080
But still, it's a sneak peek at what the game's gonna look like.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.800
Wanna try another sneak peek of what the game will look like?

14:16.800 --> 14:19.920
It's called Street Fighter 2.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.080
It's already available on Xbox Live.

14:21.080 --> 14:29.200
I'm actually very excited about this because I had a whole bunch of Udon Cruz stuff, and

14:29.200 --> 14:33.820
actually I keep them on my DeviantArt friends list, just to see the previews and the new

14:33.820 --> 14:37.400
art coming out that they do, and their work is fantastic.

14:37.400 --> 14:42.880
It's just really, really good and perfect for that genre.

14:42.880 --> 14:43.880
I think it's really good.

14:43.880 --> 14:46.780
Oh yeah, I don't mean to knock the awesome art style in this game, but do you know why

14:46.780 --> 14:49.000
this game keeps getting pushed back?

14:49.000 --> 14:55.680
So that we'll forget we already spent $10 on it a year ago.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.680
Just wanted to say.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.680
I'm gonna get it.

14:57.680 --> 15:02.980
So, it is a public beta of the game.

15:02.980 --> 15:03.980
Call it what you will.

15:03.980 --> 15:09.320
I don't know, in some way it seems to me like kind of a cheap tactic to get people more

15:09.320 --> 15:14.520
incentive to buy this Commando 3, then again, why do you think tons of people bought Crackdown?

15:14.520 --> 15:16.860
But Crackdown actually ended up to be a really good game.

15:16.860 --> 15:21.280
Not to say that Commando 3 won't as well, but it's interesting that that same tactic

15:21.280 --> 15:22.920
is now being employed elsewhere.

15:22.920 --> 15:23.920
That's what I could do.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.920
Did you see Crackdown?

15:24.920 --> 15:25.920
I like jumping the game.

15:25.920 --> 15:26.920
It's awesome though.

15:26.920 --> 15:31.160
Did you see the HD remake of 1942 that they were showing off too this week?

15:31.160 --> 15:32.280
I had heard about it.

15:32.280 --> 15:35.800
It didn't make the show real quick tonight, but what did you see about this?

15:35.800 --> 15:36.800
It looks awesome.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.800
Well, I like 1942.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.800
It's pretty cool.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.800
That's a great series of games.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.880
It's basically just redone all HD and pretty, I don't know.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.240
You know, interesting that Capcom's revisiting a lot of their series in HD because you also

15:47.240 --> 15:49.280
have Bionic Commando also coming out.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.960
But that's kind of cool because a lot of it's been saying for a long time that's what they

15:51.960 --> 15:58.800
should be doing, is remaking the games in HD and not just releasing frumpy old Tron

15:58.800 --> 15:59.800
with no frills.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.400
Like Frogger and shit like that.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.400
That's retarded.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.680
With one graphics swap that doesn't really change anything.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.300
Or Contra, you know, Konami, we're looking at you.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.880
Come on, man.

16:09.880 --> 16:13.800
Seriously, we played Frogger, do something with it.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.720
It's changing the sprites a little bit.

16:15.720 --> 16:16.720
Does not cut it.

16:16.720 --> 16:21.660
I still thought it was funny that when we got the old Contra over here, it actually

16:21.660 --> 16:26.160
had less stuff to it than the original did.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.160
You know what pissed me off?

16:27.160 --> 16:30.440
You know what game I was randomly playing the other day, just for old time's sake, was

16:30.440 --> 16:32.280
Gyruss on Xbox Live Arcade?

16:32.280 --> 16:33.280
Sweet!

16:33.280 --> 16:35.840
Well, it is one of my all-time favorite shooters that they had in the arcade.

16:35.840 --> 16:36.840
I freaking love Gyruss.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.360
I used to play it on Commodore 64 all the time, right?

16:39.360 --> 16:40.480
And they have it on Xbox Live.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.760
It came out quite some time ago.

16:41.760 --> 16:45.220
I was playing it for old time's sake the other day, and I just remembered how pissed off

16:45.220 --> 16:50.600
I was of the Xbox Live version, because the new graphics and upgraded graphics are awful.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.000
I enjoy playing the game in classic mode much better.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.760
You can't see the bullets in some of the animation in the remade version.

16:58.760 --> 16:59.760
It's awful.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.760
Cry.

17:00.760 --> 17:01.760
Very sad.

17:01.760 --> 17:08.120
Well, there's a little bit of other news that should make some people happy.

17:08.120 --> 17:14.120
Crysis Corps Final Fantasy VII Special Edition is coming out in the UK.

17:14.120 --> 17:25.000
It's, well, actually more of a special pre-order edition that Gamestation is offering that

17:25.000 --> 17:29.360
will have a 48-page art book and slipcase packaging.

17:29.360 --> 17:36.600
It will be £29.99, and it's actually the same price as the non-special edition, so

17:36.600 --> 17:41.440
basically you pre-order it from there, you get the Nito book, and you don't pay any different

17:41.440 --> 17:45.880
than you would have otherwise.

17:45.880 --> 17:56.000
But there are also, though, going to be getting Crysis Corps Final Fantasy VII on PSP in spring,

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
but Gamestation has it down for summer, so you'll actually get it before then.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.480
Just hop on there and take a look at it.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.480
Hooray for incentives.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.480
Neat.

18:06.480 --> 18:10.960
Unfortunately, I'm not getting anything like that over here as far as I'm aware.

18:10.960 --> 18:11.960
Boo.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.560
Who cares?

18:13.560 --> 18:14.560
It's an art book.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.880
I mean, honestly, who keeps the art books and stuff?

18:16.880 --> 18:18.560
I just like free things.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.480
I had an art book for Try Again one time I bought.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.520
I don't even know where the fuck it is now.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.520
It's gone.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.520
Oh well.

18:26.520 --> 18:33.240
So, unfortunately, and everyone's been kind of watching this a little bit, EA and their

18:33.240 --> 18:39.800
bid to try to take over Take-Two, now they have decided to go hostile with their bid

18:39.800 --> 18:46.560
and they're actually going to try to buy out individual shareholders now at $26 a share,

18:46.560 --> 18:54.920
and no real comment to what's going to be happening here, but apparently EA has confirmed

18:54.920 --> 19:01.860
that, yes, they are doing this, and Take-Two has basically informed their shareholders

19:01.860 --> 19:06.920
to hold out a little bit to see what's going to happen or see what kind of decision they

19:06.920 --> 19:08.640
come up with.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.640
I don't know.

19:09.640 --> 19:15.200
I don't like the whole thing at all because EA puts out some pretty good games, but at

19:15.200 --> 19:20.720
the same time I know why they're doing it just to get rid of the 2K sports franchise,

19:20.720 --> 19:21.880
and that's not a good thing.

19:21.880 --> 19:28.080
I mean, the sports games really haven't innovated too much between releases, and now if they

19:28.080 --> 19:32.040
have full reign over everything, what makes you think they're actually going to try to

19:32.040 --> 19:33.040
innovate each year?

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
They don't have to.

19:34.040 --> 19:39.640
An odd one in chat at chat.orangelaundryradio.com says, I expect EA to eventually just walk

19:39.640 --> 19:41.720
into the boardroom with socks full of quarters.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.720
You're ours now.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.280
RossdielUT says, Take-Two put themselves in this position.

19:46.280 --> 19:50.960
They're only ever in the green when GTA comes out, so of course shareholders are nervous.

19:50.960 --> 19:55.200
Interesting point, though, kind of brought up there is that do you think that EA is trying

19:55.200 --> 19:58.000
to do this now before Grand Theft Auto hits shelves?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yeah.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.840
I think that they're trying to, and if the shareholders were smart, they got to know

20:02.840 --> 20:06.840
that Grand Theft Auto IV is going to fucking make tons and tons and tons and tons and tons

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
of money.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.920
The problem, and they are right, they don't have a lot of great releases that come out,

20:10.920 --> 20:14.040
but at the same time I think a lot of their money has been trying to defend themselves

20:14.040 --> 20:20.820
against all these lawsuits and shit from stupid fuckers suing them for God knows what, blaming

20:20.820 --> 20:27.420
them for all sorts of violence and problems and people being scarred for life because

20:27.420 --> 20:31.760
they saw really crappy looking boobs in a game or something like that.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.320
Just retarded shit.

20:33.320 --> 20:37.880
And that whole thing about getting five dollars just from saying that, you know, Grand Theft

20:37.880 --> 20:42.800
Auto made you, you know, violated you in so many ways?

20:42.800 --> 20:48.640
It's just, it's really dumb, so hopefully, you know, hopefully they're not lazy with

20:48.640 --> 20:53.860
this release if there is any content in there that's questionable because, you know, people

20:53.860 --> 21:00.840
are going to find it if there is, and for the love of God, Manhunt 2, I mean, that's

21:00.840 --> 21:01.840
a perfect example.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.760
Here's another interesting comment from RossDlut, and Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer does far

21:05.760 --> 21:09.760
more damage to EA than 2K Sports ever will, so there are other sports games coming out

21:09.760 --> 21:10.760
from other places.

21:10.760 --> 21:11.760
Yeah?

21:11.760 --> 21:12.760
So no.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.960
Odd1, I keep reading for the same people, but these are good comments, Odd1 in chat

21:15.960 --> 21:20.140
says it's not like they don't have other games, BioShock was 2K and their sports franchises

21:20.140 --> 21:24.200
are perpetual sellers, but this company relies so much on one game, I worry.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.080
Well, it's Take, well, everyone's focusing on Take Two, but Take Two owns, you know,

21:28.080 --> 21:31.620
a bunch of smaller companies that do release a lot of stuff, like 2K releases quite a few

21:31.620 --> 21:36.160
games throughout the year, plus, you know, they do have a lot of smaller stuff that they

21:36.160 --> 21:41.800
deal with, like, not Destination, but like, no, Destination, or DSi games I think they

21:41.800 --> 21:46.640
do, not Destineer, but they have a lot of releases that come out that a lot of people

21:46.640 --> 21:52.560
don't realize are from them, and, you know, they do have solid stuff coming out, it's

21:52.560 --> 21:57.200
just, yeah, they do rely a lot on Grand Theft Auto, but there's, you know, Midnight Club,

21:57.200 --> 22:03.000
and they've got some good stuff in the pipelines, you know, Knorr, and the new Mafia game looks

22:03.000 --> 22:08.080
okay, not that they're really that different than Grand Theft Auto, but at least they're

22:08.080 --> 22:13.120
pretty decent games, and they make what they put out pretty good, like Warriors, holy crap,

22:13.120 --> 22:20.000
the Warriors game is awesome, it's just, I don't know, I'd rather them kind of fumble

22:20.000 --> 22:27.360
through it and be their own entity than EA buy them, because if EA buys them, then, I

22:27.360 --> 22:30.800
think that could be starting a downfall of, like, the gaming industry, because you're

22:30.800 --> 22:34.880
going to have EA and Activision owning everything, and then pretty soon, they're going to be

22:34.880 --> 22:37.480
like, hey, you know what, we don't really have to innovate too much, and then people

22:37.480 --> 22:40.440
are just going to lose interest in this shit, and they're just like, well, fine, I'm not

22:40.440 --> 22:43.500
going to buy any more games anymore, and there goes the industry.

22:43.500 --> 22:49.540
Or the industry turns independent, kind of like I was saying before, you have, you know,

22:49.540 --> 22:54.080
the XLA stuff coming out, you know, that could be a whole, that I think is a really big thing,

22:54.080 --> 22:55.080
I don't know.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.880
The XNA stuff, yeah, it looks pretty good.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.280
I'm sorry, XNA, what the hell was I saying, XLA?

22:59.280 --> 23:01.760
SSJ100Matt says Warriors MMO, please.

23:01.760 --> 23:08.440
Yeah, that'd be awesome, and RossUUT in chat says, look, they still bleed money in the

23:08.440 --> 23:10.480
years between Grand Theft Auto.

23:10.480 --> 23:16.320
True they do, and I know developing from, you know, San Andreas to now, obviously the

23:16.320 --> 23:20.640
last two prequel games that they released, Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories

23:20.640 --> 23:24.040
weren't that great and didn't make them that much money, I don't think that much development

23:24.040 --> 23:27.640
time went into them, though, either, because they're pretty much just using the old engines.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.960
But that's the same thing that's going to happen with the newer games, you know, obviously

23:30.960 --> 23:33.960
the next game, you know, they're probably going to do another Vice City or something

23:33.960 --> 23:38.240
like that, it's going to be using a similar engine and another San Andreas, maybe they'll

23:38.240 --> 23:41.360
use another similar engine, and those will make a lot of money as well.

23:41.360 --> 23:46.360
So I don't know, a lot of development up front, but I think they make it up in the back end

23:46.360 --> 23:47.360
a little bit.

23:47.360 --> 23:51.620
All right, well, lots of legal news, I mean, you could consider that some type of legal

23:51.620 --> 23:55.240
news, and then there's just lawsuits going everywhere this week, and they all center

23:55.240 --> 23:57.400
around Guitar Hero.

23:57.400 --> 24:03.280
Harmonix actually sued and then ensued Activision earlier this week, and it all had to do basically

24:03.280 --> 24:08.840
that, okay, the original Guitar Hero, I guess, had some type of clause that Harmonix would

24:08.840 --> 24:13.360
get some type of royalty payment, the way the royalty payments were set up, if they

24:13.360 --> 24:15.880
ever left the series.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.660
And there were two different figures, one was low, one was high, and they're basically

24:19.660 --> 24:23.680
saying Harmonix was claimed that they were being paid the lower royalty scheme, and they

24:23.680 --> 24:28.680
should be getting about $14.5 million out of Guitar Hero 3's profits.

24:28.680 --> 24:35.560
But then I guess at some point this was retracted, so there it was, and I don't know if maybe

24:35.560 --> 24:39.640
there was some type of settlement out of court, but the settlement was clearly retracted.

24:39.640 --> 24:45.820
But then Gibson jumped in the mix, Gibson, of course, makes guitars, Gibson decided to

24:45.820 --> 24:50.900
sue Activision, and they said the reason why is because Activision was actually infringing

24:50.900 --> 24:59.520
on a patent that dates back nine years for technology to simulate a musical performance.

24:59.520 --> 25:04.480
Activision is, of course, filed basically saying that the claim is invalid.

25:04.480 --> 25:10.820
Gibson actually sent Activision a letter in January saying, Activision basically said,

25:10.820 --> 25:15.160
you know, well, since you didn't really do anything about it, we thought it was okay.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.160
Interesting.

25:16.160 --> 25:22.600
Yeah, just like immersion, well, you didn't say anything until now, so we thought it was

25:22.600 --> 25:25.560
okay that we stole your shit.

25:25.560 --> 25:28.920
But I thought Gibson was licensed for Guitar Hero, I mean, don't they have like Gibson

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
guitars?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.560
Gibson licensed their guitars.

25:31.560 --> 25:35.720
So this is stupid.

25:35.720 --> 25:40.240
But then what's interesting about it is that you also kind of think about, hmm, you know,

25:40.240 --> 25:44.120
whatever happened to Guitar Freaks, because even though Gibson owns the thing and it's

25:44.120 --> 25:48.240
nine years old, nine years old places you back at what, 1999?

25:48.240 --> 25:54.160
Well, guess what, Guitar Freaks was in the production and planning stages in 1998, around

25:54.160 --> 25:57.160
the time the DDR first came out.

25:57.160 --> 26:02.960
Did Gibson possibly catch wind of Guitar Freaks over in Japan and filed the patent here in

26:02.960 --> 26:07.240
the U.S. and that's why Guitar Freaks never has really made it out here in the U.S.?

26:07.240 --> 26:11.160
But it did make it out over here in the U.S., they released the U.S. version over here.

26:11.160 --> 26:16.000
One very minor, not very well-heard of version that I bet completely slipped under most people's

26:16.000 --> 26:18.280
radars, honestly.

26:18.280 --> 26:22.640
They think if it comes out in Japan it's, you know, free reign to, you know, take it

26:22.640 --> 26:23.640
here.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.400
Odd One says, I love that conspiracy theory.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.400
I do too.

26:26.400 --> 26:31.660
No, I'm pretty sure, I'm more than positive that that was the biggest influence.

26:31.660 --> 26:35.920
I'm tired of people like patenting all this shit like, you know, device tube simulate

26:35.920 --> 26:36.920
performance.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.620
Okay, well that could be anything, I mean.

26:38.620 --> 26:44.320
And at some point though, if Gibson doesn't do it, it should negate itself.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.440
What did Gibson put out?

26:45.440 --> 26:48.560
Or maybe, I don't know, maybe there was some kind of, teach yourself at home.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.480
Yeah, I would love to see their patent for this, I mean, because what is it?

26:51.480 --> 26:55.080
It's a concept of, you know, simulating a performance.

26:55.080 --> 26:58.520
Okay, so pretending is now being patented.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.520
That's it.

26:59.520 --> 27:06.640
I am patenting imagination because, you know, the ability to simulate anything in your mind,

27:06.640 --> 27:08.620
I now own the rights to that.

27:08.620 --> 27:11.760
So all you fuckers better pay up because I need the money.

27:11.760 --> 27:18.240
Alright, look, all these lawsuits are kind of just, they seem unnecessary and confusing

27:18.240 --> 27:21.760
and just trying to follow them all gets us a little bit angsty.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.900
And you know what happens when we get angsty?

27:23.900 --> 27:25.280
We play the FUs of the week music.

27:25.280 --> 27:46.680
Hi, FU of the week, and I've got a couple actually, goes to this device that I'm about

27:46.680 --> 27:55.440
to put up on the webcam, and I am currently strapping it to my hand as I, as I speak.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.440
It is the stupid finger brace that they think I'm supposed to be wearing, that I'm not gonna,

27:57.440 --> 28:03.360
because it rubs a wall spot on my hand, and that's because I'm not backwards.

28:03.360 --> 28:08.480
Yeah, I didn't get the cortisone shot in my hand like I thought I was going to.

28:08.480 --> 28:14.680
Instead, they're putting me in a brace for another month, and I get the cortisone shot

28:14.680 --> 28:16.800
right after my birthday.

28:16.800 --> 28:19.080
You might want to say that just really quickly one more time, because while you're trying

28:19.080 --> 28:21.360
to put the brace on, the mic was far away, it couldn't hear you.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.360
Oh, I was thinking that.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.360
That's alright.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.360
Um, yeah.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.720
I put this on because I'm going to put it on the webcam to show everybody, they put

28:27.720 --> 28:31.640
me in a brace for my finger that I'm supposed to be wearing when I'm not typing or otherwise

28:31.640 --> 28:36.140
doing stuff, and it's actually a big pain in the ass because I can't, it's to keep me

28:36.140 --> 28:40.520
from bending my finger at the primary joint where I've got the swelling on the tendon.

28:40.520 --> 28:49.160
So they didn't do the cortisone shot, instead I am getting it done two days after my birthday.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.720
It's a fuck you enhancement tool.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.920
It is a fuck you enhancement tool.

28:51.920 --> 28:52.920
You should go show the folks on JustinTV.

28:52.920 --> 28:53.920
That's what I said I was gonna.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.000
Alright, then go, go ahead.

28:55.000 --> 29:02.840
And the other, the other F.U. goes to my husband for assigning me housework, which yes, true,

29:02.840 --> 29:06.680
it needed to be done, but it's all stuff that involved using my right hand to squeeze things,

29:06.680 --> 29:12.120
as in the vacuum, the mop, the broom, and well, I'm not supposed to be doing that with

29:12.120 --> 29:18.920
that hand, and I had forgotten to take my anti-inflammatory, so it hurt like a bitch

29:18.920 --> 29:19.920
by the time I was done.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.920
It's the point that it started popping again, so it was really, really, really fucked up,

29:23.920 --> 29:25.920
but I'll go put it on the webcam.

29:25.920 --> 29:31.200
Alright, meanwhile, Loki, F.U. the people that went and saw the movie Horton Hears a

29:31.200 --> 29:38.340
Who during our private screening, two groups of people in particular, number one was the

29:38.340 --> 29:44.480
people that thought it was smart to try to movie hop into our private screening for our

29:44.480 --> 29:45.480
company.

29:45.480 --> 29:49.860
I mean, these are people that actually think that we're not gonna notice somebody that

29:49.860 --> 29:55.200
doesn't work in our company coming in, meanwhile, like with like a half an hour left of the

29:55.200 --> 30:00.880
movie to go, with their four screaming kids, and then after they came in, spilled popcorn

30:00.880 --> 30:06.640
on the floor, they also managed to ask people to move so that their screaming kids can sit

30:06.640 --> 30:08.040
in the seat.

30:08.040 --> 30:12.400
Mind you that these people have been sitting watching the movie patiently for like an hour

30:12.400 --> 30:14.160
prior to that.

30:14.160 --> 30:19.480
So F.U. to them, and also F.U. to the person sitting next to me with their screaming child

30:19.480 --> 30:24.000
who didn't wanna be, or didn't wanna watch the movie anymore, he was running around in

30:24.000 --> 30:29.600
the aisles and stuff, and smashing popcorn on the floor, and slamming the seats down,

30:29.600 --> 30:34.640
and the father was like, stop laughing, stop laughing, you know, cuz, you know, quiet.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.920
How dare you laugh at this funny movie!

30:35.920 --> 30:37.680
Shouldn't they have been kicked out?

30:37.680 --> 30:41.920
Well, they should have been, but, you know, movie theater people are, you know, lame and

30:41.920 --> 30:46.680
they don't like to do anything, and they don't get paid enough to do anything.

30:46.680 --> 30:47.680
Why did you get the manager?

30:47.680 --> 30:51.680
Well, I didn't feel like leaving the theater, and I could possibly tolerate this kid, but

30:51.680 --> 30:56.320
he was annoying, and everyone was staring at him, but the dad was just stupid, and,

30:56.320 --> 30:57.320
you know.

30:57.320 --> 31:02.600
Oh well, everyone will talk about him behind his back when he gets back to work on Monday.

31:02.600 --> 31:08.480
Alright, my F.U. of the week goes to the random pains that I've been having, and the fact

31:08.480 --> 31:11.540
that I was taking all these drugs to counter the pain, and I might have caused more pain

31:11.540 --> 31:16.840
by doing that, and F.U. to the fact that on the antibiotic I was taking, the sticker that

31:16.840 --> 31:20.920
says do not take with antacids was probably not large enough, because I ended up taking

31:20.920 --> 31:27.280
an antacid, and I think I fucked some- I hurt, but I'm having a hard time with telling

31:27.280 --> 31:29.140
you tonight's show, but I'll be okay.

31:29.140 --> 31:33.760
Just F.U. to mystery pain that after the lab tests and blood work and all this stuff I

31:33.760 --> 31:37.360
had, they still can't figure out what it is, although thankfully my abdominal pain is really

31:37.360 --> 31:39.560
going away, so I guess that's good.

31:39.560 --> 31:44.320
It's one of those mystery things we'll never understand.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.280
So yeah, F.U. to random sickness and pain.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.280
It sucks.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.680
No, I'm not pregnant, chat.

31:50.680 --> 31:51.680
F.U.

31:51.680 --> 31:52.680
F.U. to chat.

31:52.680 --> 31:53.960
Why do they say you're pregnant?

31:53.960 --> 31:57.200
I don't know, because you know when you have abdominal pain, it might be the baby kicking.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.000
I don't know.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.600
I can't explain their reasoning.

32:00.600 --> 32:04.520
All right, we are going to go to one of our favorite segments here on the program.

32:04.520 --> 32:08.000
It's the part where you guys get to interact with us.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.680
It's the part called the mailbag.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.680
It's not just a clever name.

32:12.680 --> 32:16.740
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is where you send your emails, of which not very many

32:16.740 --> 32:18.080
of you sent in emails this week.

32:18.080 --> 32:22.520
I'm quite disappointed in our listenership.

32:22.520 --> 32:25.560
Dark Soccer is thrilled, because she doesn't have to do much work in this segment tonight.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.120
However, I am furious.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.560
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

32:29.560 --> 32:33.640
Send us those questions you've always wanted to ask us, those comments you wanted to say.

32:33.640 --> 32:39.520
Meanwhile, Dark Soccer will open up and read the crumbs that we do have.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.640
First email comes from DJ Jinai.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.520
It says, Hi, O.L.R.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.520
It's DJ Jinai.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.720
Oh, that's not just a clever name.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.040
It says, Check this out.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.760
And basically, it's a link to something.

32:50.760 --> 32:58.520
Smile DK will be looking for their samurai at San Japan, first major anime convention

32:58.520 --> 33:09.520
in SA-to-premier band's first-ever U.S. debut concert.

33:09.520 --> 33:14.160
San Japan and Viverus Studios are proud to announce the North American musical debut

33:14.160 --> 33:20.520
concert of their fan-favorite band, Smile DK, making their grand appearance at San Japan

33:20.520 --> 33:26.160
2.5, the first major Japanese culture and anime convention in San Antonio, Texas, as

33:26.160 --> 33:31.840
they will be performing on August 9, 2008 at El Tropicano Riverwalk Hotel in downtown

33:31.840 --> 33:34.440
San Antonio, Texas.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.600
I'm sure most of us know who Smile DK is.

33:37.600 --> 33:41.400
Anyway, they're going to have a new single, so I thought that was pretty cool, and thanks

33:41.400 --> 33:45.400
for letting us know about that so that we can tell everybody.

33:45.400 --> 33:54.520
I hope they sing Butterfly.

33:54.520 --> 33:59.280
As an avid UK-based listener of your show, my heart nearly skipped a beat at the news

33:59.280 --> 34:01.160
last week of Super Smash Bros.

34:01.160 --> 34:05.440
Brawl's launch, Imagine My Horror, but lack of disbelief, when I then checked with my

34:05.440 --> 34:09.040
friendly favorite online retailer and found out that Super Smash Bros.

34:09.040 --> 34:12.520
Brawl wasn't to be released until June in the UK.

34:12.520 --> 34:18.560
Let's write a three-month wait for a AAA title that has already been translated into English.

34:18.560 --> 34:23.240
The thing is, I know why this happens, it's the whole NTSC, PAL, and multiple European

34:23.240 --> 34:28.120
language thing means that there will be delays, but Nintendo has launched simultaneous releases

34:28.120 --> 34:29.760
before.

34:29.760 --> 34:33.920
To be honest, I really don't see why Nintendo and other companies cannot treat the UK as

34:33.920 --> 34:36.460
a separate territory to the rest of Europe.

34:36.460 --> 34:40.360
We don't even have the same taste in games, not that I wish to arouse traditional British

34:40.360 --> 34:46.080
anti-continental sentiment, if it's in English release the damn game in the country that

34:46.080 --> 34:47.080
made the damn language.

34:47.080 --> 34:52.000
Well, there's a lot of games that get released in the UK too that we don't receive over here

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
until a lot later.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
We didn't get Mother 3.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.880
Like anything from Eidos.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.560
We didn't get Mother 3.

34:58.560 --> 35:03.840
The other thing too is that a lot of games like Smash Bros., it's selling like hotcakes

35:03.840 --> 35:06.040
and they can't make enough discs.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.440
Well, there's more to this email.

35:08.440 --> 35:13.720
As for Super Smash Bros. Brawl, I bought the new freeloader disc for the Wii and have imported

35:13.720 --> 35:15.720
a copy of the game from Canada.

35:15.720 --> 35:18.920
Here's me flippin' the bird to you Nintendo of Europe.

35:18.920 --> 35:22.240
As for the Digidoo Technoguy, I've seen him in person.

35:22.240 --> 35:26.780
He was playing on the streets of Edinburgh during the Edinburgh Arts Festival in Scotland

35:26.780 --> 35:27.780
last summer.

35:27.780 --> 35:32.600
I have my own video footage if you want to see slash hear more, and I guess it would

35:32.600 --> 35:36.480
be pronounced Nige.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.480
So that's cool.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.480
Next email?

35:38.480 --> 35:39.480
Alrighty.

35:39.480 --> 35:40.480
Hey, OLR crew.

35:40.480 --> 35:56.160
In the words of AVGN, you know it's bullshit.

35:56.160 --> 36:00.440
People who complain that a game is too short just because it takes under 10 hours to complete.

36:00.440 --> 36:04.480
Whatever happened to a time when games usually took 30 to 60 minutes to clear and gamers

36:04.480 --> 36:05.920
were happy with it?

36:05.920 --> 36:11.000
These days, when I read a review of an arcade-style scrolling shooter or 2D platformer, one complaint

36:11.000 --> 36:14.240
that I see commonly that sticks out to me is that the game is short.

36:14.240 --> 36:18.920
I understand that longer, more epic games allow you to take in the game environment

36:18.920 --> 36:22.760
and absorb yourself in the character, but it's nice to play a quick short game that

36:22.760 --> 36:25.240
is intended to be replayed again and again.

36:25.240 --> 36:29.200
Even Gradius 5, a shooter that takes an hour and a half to complete, gets complaints of

36:29.200 --> 36:30.800
being too short.

36:30.800 --> 36:36.760
Someone please explain to me how a 25-hour shmup would work out and how that isn't going

36:36.760 --> 36:39.800
to put a strain on the level designers.

36:39.800 --> 36:44.360
Now a year and a half ago, you asked listeners if games these days are getting easier.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.600
This is related to that question.

36:45.600 --> 36:49.840
Do you think games are getting longer and longer and that shorter meant-to-be-beaten-in-one-sitting

36:49.840 --> 36:50.840
games are going away?

36:50.840 --> 36:53.880
That's from GS68.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.960
You know, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head there is that it's not the fact

36:56.960 --> 37:01.080
maybe that a game takes less than 10 hours to beat that people rag on it, but if it has

37:01.080 --> 37:05.860
no replay value, then, you know, it sucks.

37:05.860 --> 37:10.680
For instance, a game like Katamari Damacy, can't you roll through that game in like two

37:10.680 --> 37:11.680
or three hours tops?

37:11.680 --> 37:14.400
Yeah, but you can go back through and get the challenges.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.800
Exactly, and that's why people love that game because you have the total replay value and

37:17.800 --> 37:19.880
just, you know, it's cool to go roll stuff up.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.840
Now even though I kind of think they've beaten the Katamari franchise into the ground, but

37:22.840 --> 37:27.040
never mind, I'm talking about, you know, the original one, had definite replay value to

37:27.040 --> 37:28.040
it.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.400
Well, we've gone back though and put in all of our old shooters before, even though you

37:30.400 --> 37:31.960
pretty much play them all the same way.

37:31.960 --> 37:32.960
Sure.

37:32.960 --> 37:38.160
I mean, how many times do I just go talking about, you know, loving R-Type, for example?

37:38.160 --> 37:43.040
But a game like a role-playing game that really relies on story to, you know, motivate you

37:43.040 --> 37:46.880
to play the game, you know, once you've played through the story once, very few RPGs have

37:46.880 --> 37:48.560
a lot of replay value.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.560
Chrono Trigger.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.520
Well, you know, obviously some do with, be it multiple endings, super bosses, whatever

37:53.520 --> 37:56.760
it is, you know, they try to put a little more value in it.

37:56.760 --> 37:59.560
Every RPG needs Game Plus.

37:59.560 --> 38:03.080
But that's why some RPGs feel a little bit lacking, is that when they don't have that

38:03.080 --> 38:06.620
and they're only ten hours to beat, then, you know, it might be.

38:06.620 --> 38:08.960
So it really depends on what type of game it is, I guess.

38:08.960 --> 38:12.640
Well, it is even bringing up though with people complaining that Gradius 5 was short even

38:12.640 --> 38:18.000
though it was an hour and a half, and I completely disagree with them saying it was remotely

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
short.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
That a shooter, you know, shouldn't need to be more than, like, an hour in length.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.520
Because the whole point is to get from point A to point B, and then hopefully pass the

38:28.520 --> 38:36.820
boss at point B and get to point C. You know, I actually liked some of the, I guess, not

38:36.820 --> 38:37.820
as long shooters.

38:37.820 --> 38:44.000
Like, I played through Cotton however many times, and Raiden DX is another one of my

38:44.000 --> 38:47.680
favorite shooter games.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.000
Just with shooter games, part of the fun is trying to play it through it and beat your

38:51.000 --> 38:55.840
score or beat it faster, you know, and start to learn the patterns in the game, you know?

38:55.840 --> 38:56.840
I could tell you anything.

38:56.840 --> 39:01.080
I could probably pick up SkyShark right now and play through the first four levels and

39:01.080 --> 39:04.440
not die because I had the game memorized because that's the only damn way you could play through

39:04.440 --> 39:06.480
that game was to memorize where everything was.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.480
Nice.

39:07.480 --> 39:12.520
But still, I mean, I think that half of it is just being able to, you know, you challenge

39:12.520 --> 39:16.980
your way through it and you pod through it and then you get bragging rights, like, watch

39:16.980 --> 39:17.980
me play through this game.

39:17.980 --> 39:22.480
I can do, like, you know, beating R-Type on one token, for example.

39:22.480 --> 39:25.600
That gives you major bragging rights, you know what I mean?

39:25.600 --> 39:26.600
That is pretty hardcore.

39:26.600 --> 39:27.600
Yeah.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.760
I say token because I miss arcades.

39:30.760 --> 39:36.240
So last email, because we actually got another one while we were sitting here.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.600
Just now?

39:37.600 --> 39:39.840
Not just now, but we got it right, poor pull-up millet.

39:39.840 --> 39:40.840
Gotcha.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.240
So, virtual console games are overpriced.

39:43.240 --> 39:47.200
You guys have already gone over this, but you haven't gone over it in a while, so this

39:47.200 --> 39:50.560
is kind of irrelevant to, well, anything.

39:50.560 --> 39:54.960
But I have, but I have an idea to fix it.

39:54.960 --> 39:59.320
If people pay yearly subscriptions for Xbox Live and Nintendo could do something like

39:59.320 --> 40:00.320
that for virtual console.

40:00.320 --> 40:04.400
Yes, I mean, exactly along the lines of the Sega channel because I freaking love the Sega

40:04.400 --> 40:05.400
channel.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.720
It's not, I'm not actually sure how it would work, but I thought I would share it, and

40:08.720 --> 40:10.720
that's from Red Ring Saturn.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.720
Yeah?

40:11.720 --> 40:15.400
Oh, I'm sorry, why don't I have one more time real quick?

40:15.400 --> 40:17.400
Oh, I was working on something else, sorry.

40:17.400 --> 40:22.440
Well, we've actually brought this up on the show of instead of paying for your virtual

40:22.440 --> 40:24.800
console games, you pay a subscription cost, like...

40:24.800 --> 40:26.360
Oh, like GameTap.

40:26.360 --> 40:27.360
Yeah.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.360
Basically.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.560
I would love to see Nintendo set something like that up.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.240
They're talking about the Sega channel.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.840
Yeah, a lot of their games, you know, you don't want to spend five bucks on, you know,

40:35.840 --> 40:40.080
a game that you only want to play a couple times, but I think that's exactly why it's

40:40.080 --> 40:45.120
not set up that way because I think Nintendo, in a way, kind of preys on that sort of system.

40:45.120 --> 40:50.140
I've also heard of Xbox Live, you know, somebody had suggested instead of charging the five

40:50.140 --> 40:56.740
dollars for the game, you pay 25 cents a play, but, you know, then I think about like some

40:56.740 --> 41:00.920
of the systems like back in the 80s and 90s, like I remember I had an old school cable

41:00.920 --> 41:01.920
system back in the 80s.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.760
It was way ahead of its time.

41:03.760 --> 41:08.720
We had a system where you could actually buy games for like 10 cents a game and play them,

41:08.720 --> 41:09.720
and it didn't do very well.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.600
It wasn't very well received.

41:11.600 --> 41:16.680
People don't like to play that way for whatever reason.

41:16.680 --> 41:20.440
I think honestly if they stop making money, they'll change it, but in the meantime it

41:20.440 --> 41:22.560
works and if it ain't broke, they ain't going to fix it.

41:22.560 --> 41:27.400
I mean it might sound better from a consumer end, but, you know, look at what GameTap is

41:27.400 --> 41:28.400
made up of though.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.060
GameTap kind of makes a thriving on.

41:30.060 --> 41:32.920
It doesn't have a lot of, I mean it has, I shouldn't say it doesn't have a lot, it has

41:32.920 --> 41:38.400
some huge name AAA titles in it, but a lot of GameTap's charm is discovering old classics

41:38.400 --> 41:40.480
you missed the first time.

41:40.480 --> 41:44.120
Nintendo, Xbox Live, they don't really need to do that for various reasons.

41:44.120 --> 41:47.320
So that was the last email?

41:47.320 --> 41:48.320
It was.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.320
I double checked.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.320
All right.

41:50.320 --> 41:55.160
Well, we're going to supplement the emails this week with some voicemails that we've

41:55.160 --> 41:56.360
gotten throughout the week.

41:56.360 --> 42:00.320
So let's actually go and check out some voicemails that we've received this week.

42:00.320 --> 42:04.760
Please don't call the show because we're not actually taking Skype calls at this time.

42:04.760 --> 42:07.040
We're just trying to get through some voicemails.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.040
And when you call, it switches my window on me and it makes me very angry.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.640
It makes me want to make you not able to call us later.

42:12.640 --> 42:13.640
Hey, O.R.R.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.640
It's PKJR92.

42:14.640 --> 42:22.000
Just wanted to tell you guys that you guys are the greatest.

42:22.000 --> 42:28.320
And if you're not for the difference in time zones, I will post them live every Sunday

42:28.320 --> 42:34.080
on every show on your network.

42:34.080 --> 42:39.560
Just want to say, guys, you guys are great, thanks.

42:39.560 --> 42:48.600
And to do a show earlier, like earlier, so that people in other time zones, like me,

42:48.600 --> 42:52.600
I'm like three hours behind you, or sorry, ahead of you.

42:52.600 --> 42:58.720
So 12 o'clock at night is kind of late because I've got school tomorrow, school the next

42:58.720 --> 43:00.720
day, et cetera.

43:00.720 --> 43:10.480
Just want to say that keep going, because you guys are the only podcast I listen to,

43:10.480 --> 43:12.800
so the only ones I like.

43:12.800 --> 43:13.800
So see you.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.400
Well, thank you very much for that voicemail.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.840
The reason why we don't tape our show earlier is because, keep in mind, even though it's

43:19.840 --> 43:24.020
three hours later and all that, we do understand, we have some folks that stay up insanely late

43:24.020 --> 43:26.800
to listen to our show, and nothing but props to you guys.

43:26.800 --> 43:31.760
The problem is, though, if we tape earlier, then we totally have to give up our Sunday,

43:31.760 --> 43:36.700
and Sunday's sometimes the day to get errands done, clean the house, or whatever, it really

43:36.700 --> 43:38.400
would cut into the day.

43:38.400 --> 43:41.400
So that's why we don't tape any of our Sundays, although we have been talking about doing

43:41.400 --> 43:43.640
a one-off noon show.

43:43.640 --> 43:48.080
We were going to tape at noon, so that way, especially the overseas listeners could tune

43:48.080 --> 43:49.080
in live.

43:49.080 --> 43:50.080
We just need to set a date for that.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.080
We need to make that happen.

43:51.080 --> 43:52.080
Well, let me know.

43:52.080 --> 43:55.320
I've got two days off next week.

43:55.320 --> 43:56.320
We'll see.

43:56.320 --> 44:00.000
Two days off next week will work for me, but maybe later in the month or early April, sooner

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
rather than later.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.880
We'll talk about that in our super secret forums where we discuss show thingies.

44:05.880 --> 44:08.700
All right, so we'll make that happen for you guys.

44:08.700 --> 44:09.700
Let's do one more voicemail.

44:09.700 --> 44:11.360
I thought this one was pretty good.

44:11.360 --> 44:12.360
Hello.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.360
This is DSmaster25.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.360
I'm a UJANA fan.

44:14.360 --> 44:15.360
How dare you bash Hannah Montana?

44:15.360 --> 44:16.360
Good Lord.

44:16.360 --> 44:17.360
She's the best Sony fan in the world.

44:17.360 --> 44:18.360
She's the best.

44:18.360 --> 44:26.680
How dare you bash Hannah Montana, good Lord, she's the best Sony for once.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.720
I'd like to see them get bashed.

44:28.720 --> 44:36.200
Not my favorite pop star, Ole Miss Miley, okay, Hannah Montana.

44:36.200 --> 44:43.720
Stop that here or I'm not watching any more shows.

44:43.720 --> 44:44.720
Bye.

44:44.720 --> 44:50.920
Well, I didn't realize we had legions of Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus fans that listen to

44:50.920 --> 44:55.640
our show, so I think we need to take a moment to apologize to all the Hannah Montana fans

44:55.640 --> 44:59.640
that listen to our program.

44:59.640 --> 45:07.920
So we apologize dearly if you were offended by our comments on Hannah Montana, no we don't,

45:07.920 --> 45:11.160
and we're really sorry we won't try to do it or we'll try not to do that again in the

45:11.160 --> 45:18.000
future, and remember, hey, we're big fans of Hannah Montana's DS game, especially Footy

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Monster.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.720
But don't listen to him, it's not because it's a good music game, he just secretly really

45:22.720 --> 45:33.240
loves Hannah Montana.

45:33.240 --> 45:37.560
I just love the chat lighting up here, DDR Dollar Bill, what the fuck is this?

45:37.560 --> 45:42.360
The fuck is this trash, Frisbee, why do people actually like her?

45:42.360 --> 45:46.160
DDR Dollar Bill, I've never even heard her.

45:46.160 --> 45:53.000
Is that what's popular?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.800
Leave Hannah Alone, how was that voicemail?

45:55.800 --> 46:03.560
Leave Hannah Alone, I get it, doing the whole Britney thing, yeah, please, back to gaming

46:03.560 --> 46:04.560
please.

46:04.560 --> 46:11.040
So this I'm sure is a shocker to everybody, but guess what, 2KMarin is actually working

46:11.040 --> 46:20.320
on Bioshock 2, and they have peg day, I don't know, forecasted release date of quarter four

46:20.320 --> 46:22.500
2009.

46:22.500 --> 46:31.340
So Christmas 2009, you'll be playing Bioshock 2, hooray!

46:31.340 --> 46:41.760
That's shocking, what, Bioshock 2 is coming out, I am so shocked, beyond belief, I would

46:41.760 --> 46:51.280
have never guessed, you know what, EA is working on Madden 2009, and after that Madden 2010,

46:51.280 --> 46:55.040
but it makes me wonder though, aren't you violating an NDA by saying that, might be,

46:55.040 --> 46:57.720
but you know what makes me kind of wonder, because you know how it's like Madden 08,

46:57.720 --> 47:02.680
or Madden 09, what are they going to do, Madden 10, maybe, why not, it's going to have Madden

47:02.680 --> 47:03.680
2010.

47:03.680 --> 47:09.240
Are these things really worth losing sleep about, or wasting time on an internet radio

47:09.240 --> 47:10.240
program talking about?

47:10.240 --> 47:15.520
I don't know, it's like the whole, you know, Y2K, but with Madden numbers, something's

47:15.520 --> 47:20.840
going to happen, it's going to like open a rift or something, we'll see what happens.

47:20.840 --> 47:25.760
Hey, here's another series that keeps on going, Guilty Gear!

47:25.760 --> 47:29.800
Guilty Gear 2 Overture is coming out, but it's not the same type of Guilty Gear you

47:29.800 --> 47:34.240
might be thinking of, it's coming out this fall for the Xbox 360, it's a tactical action

47:34.240 --> 47:35.240
game.

47:35.240 --> 47:39.040
Now it's like 3D, it takes all these characters you might know from the Guilty Gear, which

47:39.040 --> 47:43.760
by the way is a 2D fighting game, and now they're going to be in a 3D action strategy

47:43.760 --> 47:49.600
type of game, so it works so well for Soul Calibur, when it went to Soul Calibur Legends,

47:49.600 --> 47:50.600
why not?

47:50.600 --> 47:51.600
I've played it actually.

47:51.600 --> 47:52.600
Really?

47:52.600 --> 47:53.600
Yes.

47:53.600 --> 47:54.600
What do you think?

47:54.600 --> 48:02.640
I think it's going to be a Japanese account on Xbox Live, but it's okay, it's very similar

48:02.640 --> 48:08.360
to like Dynasty Warriors on 99 Nights, but in the Guilty Gear universe.

48:08.360 --> 48:13.360
I actually kind of liked 99 Nights for a little bit, and then it got a little old to me.

48:13.360 --> 48:17.420
It's very similar to that, like you've got enemies you kill, and checkpoints you get

48:17.420 --> 48:22.840
to, and you take them over, and that kind of stuff, definitely not a fighting game if

48:22.840 --> 48:25.600
that's what you're expecting.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.600
It's okay.

48:26.600 --> 48:30.600
I just wish a lot of these things when they come to new systems, you know what, people

48:30.600 --> 48:34.660
just like fighting games, so just release Guilty Gear as a fighting game, but they did

48:34.660 --> 48:39.760
do that already on the Wii, so at least they get it for some systems, so it's just, others

48:39.760 --> 48:44.280
are just trying something a little different, so more power to them I guess, trying to innovate

48:44.280 --> 48:48.920
SNK, come on.

48:48.920 --> 48:52.720
Well I don't know, I think I'll probably just end up passing on this game, maybe it's just

48:52.720 --> 48:53.720
Sony.

48:53.720 --> 48:59.600
Well, other people who said pass were actually Microsoft.

48:59.600 --> 49:05.320
There was a rumor going around, especially since Sony, one of the Sony executives told

49:05.320 --> 49:11.000
the Financial Times that Sony was in talks with Microsoft about offering them a Blu-ray

49:11.000 --> 49:16.320
drive for the Xbox 360, but Aaron Greenberg, who's their group product manager for Xbox

49:16.320 --> 49:23.360
360 said, nuh-uh, no, to quote, Xbox is not currently in talks with Sony or the Blu-ray

49:23.360 --> 49:28.280
association to integrate Blu-ray into the Xbox experience.

49:28.280 --> 49:35.120
That's a neat way to phrase it, the Xbox experience, but he did go on to say though that right

49:35.120 --> 49:43.800
now Xbox 360 is the only console offering digital distribution of entertainment content.

49:43.800 --> 49:46.360
We don't really know how long they're gonna be the only ones that does that, seeing that

49:46.360 --> 49:56.680
Sony owns a movie company, but hey, a bunch of us who lucked out the tail end of that

49:56.680 --> 50:04.560
and picked up on those cheap HD DVD players, hey, I even got five free HD DVDs.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.600
The Xbox experience.

50:06.600 --> 50:07.600
I know, that's so cool.

50:07.600 --> 50:10.600
You know what the Xbox Live experience is?

50:10.600 --> 50:15.640
Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit, fuck, gay, gay, fuck, fuck.

50:15.640 --> 50:19.200
That's the Xbox Live experience right there.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.120
There's lots of other words in there, too, I don't feel like repeating.

50:21.120 --> 50:24.840
So what part of the Xbox experience is the Red Ring of Death?

50:24.840 --> 50:28.520
Is that the fun part?

50:28.520 --> 50:30.600
I mean, just wondering.

50:30.600 --> 50:34.760
I did think that was a witty retort, though, that the Xbox does not need a Blu-ray drive

50:34.760 --> 50:36.560
because they have downloadable movies.

50:36.560 --> 50:37.560
So ha.

50:37.560 --> 50:38.560
And they're already high-definition.

50:38.560 --> 50:45.200
Yeah, here's a little problem with that logic, though, folks, and anyone that actually watches

50:45.200 --> 50:50.320
a lot of pay-per-view stuff knows, movies don't come out on street date on that service,

50:50.320 --> 50:56.840
usually it's a month later, so if you want to watch it day one, Blu-ray, well, hopefully

50:56.840 --> 51:03.800
Blu-ray is the only way to go on that stuff, or you can watch it on DVD, I guess.

51:03.800 --> 51:09.760
That's the angle they should work on that shit, but who really cares, I mean, come on.

51:09.760 --> 51:18.480
I think that them accepting Blu-ray right now into their experience is sort of like

51:18.480 --> 51:23.960
admitting some sort of defeat to Sony in some respect.

51:23.960 --> 51:25.520
We ain't talking to those bitches.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.080
Like, uh-uh.

51:27.080 --> 51:29.280
I don't care what they have, we don't want their shit.

51:29.280 --> 51:33.400
Yeah, I mean, it would look kind of silly for Microsoft to kind of endorse a Sony product

51:33.400 --> 51:37.520
like that, but I would think that in the next Microsoft system, they're going to have to

51:37.520 --> 51:41.040
support Blu-ray somehow, I would think, but who knows, you know?

51:41.040 --> 51:45.000
We don't play DVDs, you don't necessarily have to play movies to be a console that succeeds.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.040
Hey, they can always do the Dreamcast path.

51:47.040 --> 51:51.640
They can always put HD DVD drives in there and use that as the format for the system,

51:51.640 --> 51:56.800
because who says that they have to stop making discs for it, I mean, even though Toshiba

51:56.800 --> 52:01.800
has stopped making them, but still, at the same time, who makes UMDs, you know?

52:01.800 --> 52:05.640
Wouldn't that seem like a step backwards if Microsoft in their next system put an HD DVD

52:05.640 --> 52:06.640
drive in them?

52:06.640 --> 52:10.760
It'd be hard to copy them if there's no HD DVD drives out there, now would it?

52:10.760 --> 52:11.760
Interesting thought.

52:11.760 --> 52:15.740
I suppose you have this format already built up in some movie, well, it'd be interesting,

52:15.740 --> 52:17.520
but I don't know, I just don't see it happening.

52:17.520 --> 52:21.120
It'd be akin to using the, like I was bringing up with the Dreamcast, it'd be akin to using

52:21.120 --> 52:28.960
the Giga discs, and you know how long it took them to crack those.

52:28.960 --> 52:33.600
One cool thing, though, that is entertainment related, and I guess download content, new

52:33.600 --> 52:35.600
islands coming to Burnout Paradise.

52:35.600 --> 52:40.940
A bunch of new stuff that you'll be able to play and drive your cars through and crash

52:40.940 --> 52:41.940
through and stuff.

52:41.940 --> 52:46.280
In fact, actually, you can kind of see some of what's going to be available on that in

52:46.280 --> 52:51.600
the game right now, because there's actually bridges that are being worked on and constructed,

52:51.600 --> 52:53.640
I guess, in the game.

52:53.640 --> 52:57.660
So later on, what they're going to do is have a free download, yes, because these islands

52:57.660 --> 53:04.680
are going to be free, and you'll be able to expand your experience on Burnout Paradise.

53:04.680 --> 53:09.080
There are also going to be some new cars available as well, those are not free.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.080
But those are optional.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.080
Interesting.

53:11.080 --> 53:13.240
Who really needs extra cars when there's a lot in the game, anyways?

53:13.240 --> 53:15.920
I would think, now I don't know, I'm not a hardcore racing fan, but I would think the

53:15.920 --> 53:18.720
new areas are more of a perk than a new car.

53:18.720 --> 53:19.720
Yeah.

53:19.720 --> 53:20.720
Huh.

53:20.720 --> 53:21.720
By a long shot.

53:21.720 --> 53:26.520
Unless a new car is a super jetmobile that can jump 500 miles or something like that,

53:26.520 --> 53:28.200
in which case I'll need that.

53:28.200 --> 53:31.600
The new car is Sonic.

53:31.600 --> 53:38.960
Just like, was it in Ridge Racer, where you have the hover cars and the rocket cars.

53:38.960 --> 53:41.200
That's one thing about Ridge Racer, it's awesome.

53:41.200 --> 53:46.960
Some rumors are abounding about Grand Theft Auto IV, and that is its new multiplayer modes.

53:46.960 --> 53:52.200
Sixteen players and fifteen different modes in the game, this all coming from PlayStation

53:52.200 --> 53:56.960
Magazine in Spain, a translation from that magazine.

53:56.960 --> 54:01.320
And there it is, so supposedly it's going to be sixteen player modes, does that make

54:01.320 --> 54:02.320
you pretty excited, Loki?

54:02.320 --> 54:03.320
Oh hell yes.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.880
I know you're very excited about, are you going to be able to network that many systems

54:05.880 --> 54:06.880
at work?

54:06.880 --> 54:11.000
We have five already, six if I get this other one working.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Jeez.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
All right, very cool.

54:13.000 --> 54:18.020
Although I'm not too optimistic about this sixth one, but five.

54:18.020 --> 54:24.260
Some of the games from their translations, Hangman's News, Carjack City, Bomb Debase,

54:24.260 --> 54:31.540
Mafia Work, Death Batch, Turf War, Cops and Crooks, Race, Dealbreaker, Free Mode.

54:31.540 --> 54:33.640
We are going to, you know.

54:33.640 --> 54:35.080
Does it sound legit to you?

54:35.080 --> 54:40.280
I think it sounds legit, that stuff sounds very legit.

54:40.280 --> 54:43.240
I can't wait to play this game, we're going to be playing this thing every day, dude.

54:43.240 --> 54:47.880
And I don't know, we're just going to kick everyone's ass online, it'll be fun.

54:47.880 --> 54:50.400
I hope the game sucks, just to spite you.

54:50.400 --> 54:54.640
Yeah, too bad it's not going to happen.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.640
We'll see.

54:55.640 --> 55:01.240
Well, this actually makes me kind of happy, because everyone knows I'm a big Dreamcast

55:01.240 --> 55:02.760
fan.

55:02.760 --> 55:11.160
We are getting Mr. Driller online, a downloadable version that's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

55:11.160 --> 55:15.360
There's not a whole bunch of details on it right now, but it's been confirmed for a spring

55:15.360 --> 55:16.880
release in Japan.

55:16.880 --> 55:21.260
So hopefully we won't get it too much longer after, and it's Mr. Driller.

55:21.260 --> 55:22.760
I'm sure we'll get it at the same time.

55:22.760 --> 55:27.240
There hasn't really been any releases in Japan on Xbox Live Arcade that we haven't gotten

55:27.240 --> 55:29.240
at the same time, as far as I'm aware.

55:29.240 --> 55:30.880
Well, then even better.

55:30.880 --> 55:31.880
I don't know.

55:31.880 --> 55:34.480
It'll be a first, I guess.

55:34.480 --> 55:38.880
Hitstun and Chat says, this looks just like Mr. Driller DS.

55:38.880 --> 55:43.160
I wouldn't doubt that, it's Mr. Driller.

55:43.160 --> 55:50.160
It probably does look like most versions of Mr. Driller, because it is Mr. Driller.

55:50.160 --> 55:52.880
Mr. Driller's kind of cool.

55:52.880 --> 55:56.800
It seems really easy at first, but there's a lot of depth to the puzzle in the game.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.160
It's interesting.

55:59.160 --> 56:05.120
A new version of the Wii's Twilight Hack, and that is the hack using Twilight Princess

56:05.120 --> 56:08.980
to run homebrew code, has been made available.

56:08.980 --> 56:16.320
It's version 0.1A3, and now what's kind of neat about it is that you'll be able to run

56:16.320 --> 56:22.720
data off of SD memory cards using the SD memory card slot in the Wii system itself.

56:22.720 --> 56:29.280
Prior to that, you'd have to have an SD Gecko or some sort of GameCube adapter to run it

56:29.280 --> 56:33.640
off of SD memory cards, but now you can actually do it on the drive.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.960
Right now, though, not many things supporting it.

56:35.960 --> 56:43.120
Only game that actually works with it right now is a version of Tetris, but soon it will

56:43.120 --> 56:48.160
be supporting a lot more things, but that's just kind of interesting that they have this

56:48.160 --> 56:52.360
exploit in there, and I don't know if Nintendo will be able to fix it.

56:52.360 --> 56:54.440
I'm sure it'll be in the next patch.

56:54.440 --> 56:58.560
That loophole's going to get closed right up, but who knows?

56:58.560 --> 56:59.560
Maybe they'll luck out.

56:59.560 --> 57:04.120
Yeah, I know, it's worked out well for Sony so far.

57:04.120 --> 57:08.200
Some folks that have not lucked out are folks that were looking forward to playing Army

57:08.200 --> 57:15.360
of Two across different regions, because Army of Two apparently has region-locked online

57:15.360 --> 57:16.360
play.

57:16.360 --> 57:20.440
There's a very, very small little note in the manual for Army of Two.

57:20.440 --> 57:24.760
Note, the online game modes in Army of Two are not cross-region compatible and is only

57:24.760 --> 57:27.160
supported between PAL disks.

57:27.160 --> 57:30.580
Of course, the PAL version's manual has that note in there, so if you were looking forward

57:30.580 --> 57:36.120
to playing folks in Europe, if you're in the US, sorry, can't do it in Army of Two.

57:36.120 --> 57:41.180
Some people are pretty pissed off about this, but in a way, I kind of wonder, is it maybe

57:41.180 --> 57:44.960
because the lag is too great, because aren't these supposed to be some huge multiplayer

57:44.960 --> 57:48.480
matches, and if you have one person that's far away like that, it would cause a tremendous

57:48.480 --> 57:49.480
amount of lag?

57:49.480 --> 57:53.160
They were saying it's just a save on server strain, because Army Two's going to be the

57:53.160 --> 57:57.960
uber-awesome game or something, so you know.

57:57.960 --> 58:03.160
I don't know, I still wish they would leave that option open, but maybe it's not the default

58:03.160 --> 58:07.080
way to assign the players.

58:07.080 --> 58:11.240
But if you really wanted to play against somebody in the UK or overseas or whatever, you should

58:11.240 --> 58:12.240
be able to.

58:12.240 --> 58:16.040
It's just EA, it's broken, whatever.

58:16.040 --> 58:20.680
I hope this isn't a trend, that's all I have to say.

58:20.680 --> 58:24.720
Well, I hope not.

58:24.720 --> 58:32.680
For fans of PopCap, there's actually going to be a PopCap hits release, a second one

58:32.680 --> 58:40.600
actually, that's going to have Heavy Weapon and Zuma on PS2 on a single disc.

58:40.600 --> 58:44.280
So if you like to get your casual games, I imagine it's going to be dirt cheap.

58:44.280 --> 58:45.280
20 bucks.

58:45.280 --> 58:46.280
That's not bad.

58:46.280 --> 58:47.280
$19.95.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.040
That's about the same price you'd pay for them on Xbox Live.

58:49.040 --> 58:53.680
Yeah, of course you can probably play them free online, but hey.

58:53.680 --> 58:55.240
But then you don't get all those extra features.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.240
That's true.

58:56.240 --> 58:58.120
New boards, new puzzles, new everything.

58:58.120 --> 59:00.560
I kind of liked Heavy Weapon, it was a fun game.

59:00.560 --> 59:03.640
Zuma, Zuma, I'm a little burned out on Zuma.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.000
I haven't played Zuma.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.520
It's just fun, but I'm a little burned out on it, but Heavy Weapon was cool.

59:08.520 --> 59:09.520
There you have it.

59:09.520 --> 59:11.760
I like anything with weapon in the title.

59:11.760 --> 59:18.920
All right, we're going to be opening the Skype line very soon for you guys, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

59:18.920 --> 59:22.680
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, that's going to be opening very soon.

59:22.680 --> 59:24.960
I just want to read a couple of quick comments from chat.

59:24.960 --> 59:29.840
Karpatkin is in chat, he has his own show, or co-host a show over on All Games, and I

59:29.840 --> 59:35.160
happen to know because of that that he's in the UK and he says it has to do with P2P network

59:35.160 --> 59:42.080
play, not servers in regards to Army of Two, so hmm, interesting.

59:42.080 --> 59:47.240
Let's go to the phones, if you want to give us a call again, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username

59:47.240 --> 59:49.240
on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

59:49.240 --> 59:52.880
The phone lines are now open.

59:52.880 --> 59:53.880
Give us a call.

59:53.880 --> 59:54.880
We'll be waiting.

59:54.880 --> 59:57.680
In the meantime, we have a, oh, we got a call.

59:57.680 --> 59:59.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Who's this?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Oh, hi.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
This is RossdielUT.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Well, hello, RossdielUT.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
What's on your mind?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:14.080
Well, one thing, I want to go back to Microsoft's decision about not supporting Blu-ray and touting

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:21.960
their online service, I really think they're limiting their potential audience by doing

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.600
that, honestly.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:31.400
You know, since, like it or not, a whole lot of Americans either can't or don't want to

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.720
download movies, especially on their shitty-ass DRM service.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:39.960
Wait, wait, I've got to ask, what is it about Microsoft's service you don't like?

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.160
Well, I think I told you about what happened to me with my XBLA games.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.880
Oh, when you had to send your thing back, you had to redownload them all and all that?

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.800
I had to redownload them again, then I had to, well, I didn't have to redownload them,

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.320
but the way the DRM works is that you can't access your content offline, like if your

01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.560
internet goes on the fritz.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560
Right, that's right.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.560
Okay.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.760
I mean, I've heard common problems about that, and the same goes for movies, basically.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:14.800
Well, movies, you don't even get to keep the movies, you can only watch them once.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.880
And no, Rama, the PlayStation Network isn't anywhere near as draconian.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.680
You can activate up to five systems, and it's not anywhere near as hard to get things revalidated.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.040
Okay, I've got to read the comment from chat that you responded to for the sake of our

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.840
podcast listeners who don't see chat.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.120
Rama said, shitty, yes, but it's better than the PlayStation Network.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.360
All right, so Microsoft's not doing Blu-ray.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.000
You think that's a decision that makes sense, or you think it's going to hurt them in the

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.520
long run?

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.160
I think it's going to hurt them in the long run.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:49.520
I think what we forget, being in cities, you know, you're in Sacramento, I'm in Miami,

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:57.000
I'm sure a lot of the people in the chat are from decent-sized cities, is that large parts

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.240
of the country, especially the further west you go until you get to California, broadband

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.240
isn't as easily available, or it's very expensive.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:13.120
I mean, not only that, but most people are going to have common customer-grade DSLs.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:19.360
They're not going to be paying $80 a month for the high-end stuff, you know what I mean?

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.240
But don't you think that in those places, those are the places where Blockbuster and

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.840
Hollywood Video and Movie Gallery and all those places are still doing well?

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.680
Well, they're still doing well here in Miami.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.840
There's a Blockbuster right in front of my house.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.640
That place is always doing great business.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.640
They're still doing well in cities.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.120
You still see the mom-and-pop stores anymore.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.080
I used to work, my very first job was at a mom-and-pop video game store, and they went

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.360
under years ago.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.480
Well, that has more to do with the chains, you know, bullying everybody out than anything

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.480
else.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.240
That's a whole other issue we could spend a whole show doing.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.320
I'll just say, though, we had one thing that Hollywood and Blockbuster and all them didn't

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320
have.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320
We rented porn.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.760
So, you know, how they went out of business on the road.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.240
You still see places that run porn, West Coast and things like that, you know, chains here

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.480
in the Southeast.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:19.160
But when you go download only, you're limiting yourself because, let's face it, if you want

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:30.280
to download something other than a damn act up to saying it pretty much, I mean, one megabit

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.080
connection is 40 bucks.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.880
That's not going to get you a high definition movie in a reasonable amount of time.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.520
I go to Xbox Live Arcade, it takes like an hour to download a movie.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:48.680
The downloading thing doesn't do a lot for our need-it-now kind of culture, the self-gratification

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.120
culture that we live in.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.320
The reason why Blockbuster and all that do well is because when somebody thinks, I want

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.200
to rent a movie, they want to rent a movie tonight, now.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.640
They don't want to wait for Netflix.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.160
They don't want to wait to download it.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.160
They want to go get it now.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:09.000
Even Netflix, I mean, if you keep a steady queue, you always have a movie or two there.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.720
But what if the one that's at your house isn't necessarily, and don't get me wrong, I love

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.040
Netflix, I'm just being devil's advocate, what if the one at your house right now isn't

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:21.000
the one that you end up wanting to watch when you're talking about with friends, maybe you're

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
talking about an old classic 80s movie that nobody has?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.240
At the end of the day, you get in the car and you go to Blockbuster.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:34.280
You get in the car or if you're lucky enough like I am, you walk across the street and

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:38.080
there's your Blockbuster, you pick up your movie.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.060
With Blu-ray, you're going to be able to do that.

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:45.360
In the coming months, we already have Blu-ray for rental in my place and you're going to

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.360
see that all over the place.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:49.760
We're going to see Blu-ray rentals all over the place and it's just going to take over.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760
Well, we'll see.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.200
Ross, to you, too, we've got to wrap up.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.200
We're getting towards time.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.320
Any other last minute thoughts?

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.240
One last minute thing, I'm surprised you guys didn't talk about the NPDs this month.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.400
What specifically about them?

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:14.040
The PS3 outsold the 360 for the second month in a row, selling 281,000 units versus 255,

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:17.120
but what really surprised me was how well the PS2 did.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.600
I don't know if you saw this.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.340
It sold 352,000.

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.160
That's pretty typical for the PS2.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.160
It's actually the matching.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.080
I was about to say, doesn't everybody have it?

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.080
It's still the spare bedroom system.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.240
It's the system you buy for the younger kids so they can feel cool because they have a

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.880
video gaming system in their room.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:41.080
I think most folks like us that listen to programs like this, we all have PS2s at this

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.080
point.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.080
It's not just us.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.800
The system has already sold 50 million in America alone.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.600
And the only reason the PS3 outsold the 360 is because the 360 is in a shortage right

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.600
now.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600
Oh, please.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.640
Every store I go to there's a ton of 360s.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.640
Microsoft is making a shortage.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.320
Well, I know because I talked to Microsoft that there's a fucking shortage going on right

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.600
now and they, in fact, commented, yeah, there is a shortage going on right now.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.280
We know that the PlayStation 3 is going to outsell us this month and sure enough then

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.920
that's not just damage control.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:15.600
It's not damage control because they're going to have enough, oh right, yeah, okay, I'm

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.240
sure all of a sudden Blu-ray wins now and they're going to sell billions of systems

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.240
and they'll be the number one.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.980
Well, actually I was kind of thinking like couldn't the possibility because now that

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:26.520
Blu-ray has won the war, so to speak, maybe that moves some PS3s.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520
Not going to fucking happen.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.680
I bet you anything in April that the 360 is definitely going to outsell a PS3 and buy

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.680
a lot.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.680
What kind of bet?

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.680
Shut up.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:35.680
I don't know.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.680
It's worth a try.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:43.840
It's not so much just Blu-ray but ever since we saw the system go down to the 399 with

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.320
the 40 gig, you know, the sales have picked up.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.720
Yeah, and Sony is really confident on that.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.720
You know why?

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.440
Because now they're removing the Blu-ray movie that comes with it because they're,

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.320
guess what, fuckers will buy your own Blu-ray.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.480
All right, I got to wrap it up, you guys, I'm supposed to keep it in the four minutes

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.000
and we're on seven, but Ross Steel, UT, thank you for your perspective as always.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Take care, buddy.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Okay, bye-bye.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Bye-bye.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
You know, I do like this comment from SSJ100Matt in chat, he says, fact, HDTV needs to be the

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.200
standard before Blu-ray can really take off.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.200
I agree.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.080
But in 2009 with that whole digital TV switchover, I see there's a distinct possibility.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.320
I think this holiday season is huge for HDTVs.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.140
This holiday is going to be awesome and, you know, but the fact is there is a shortage

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:28.600
on systems right now, I know that from, you know, working a retail standpoint and from

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.600
Microsoft actually calling.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.600
All right, all right, let's go to a new call, breathe in.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.680
All right, new call, hi, you're on Horse House Radio, who's this?

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.680
Hi, this is Act Deft.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.360
Hi, Act Deft, what's on your mind?

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.360
Hello.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.160
Oh, I just wanted to comment about video games live.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:49.640
Oh, that's right, you got to go and the concert just happened in Mexico recently, right?

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640
Yeah.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640
And how was it?

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:57.400
Oh, it was so fucking epic and amazing.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.520
It was everything I expected and more.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:07.400
It was a pretty amazing, how do you say it, show, yeah.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.680
Describe for us like the best part.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:17.800
I seriously can't choose the best part, though if I had to choose a song they played, maybe

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:25.840
it was the Kingdom Hearts theme song, sampling clean, an orchestra, oh, it was so fucking

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.840
amazing.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.840
Nice.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.640
You sound like you were blown away.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.640
How was this?

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.520
Yeah, I almost cried at that part.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.360
How was the audience?

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.620
Was there a lot of people there?

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.840
Was it a very full house or?

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:50.680
Well, not a full house, though approximately like 2,000 people and maybe, well, the Bull

01:08:50.680 --> 01:09:00.920
Ring maybe has 5,000 people capacity and it was like 2,000 approximately, more or less.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.080
So it was, there was a lot of people, though it was not full.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.760
Okay, not too bad though.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.500
Sounds like a pretty filled up crowd, if nothing else.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:14.380
Did they give an indication that they might come back?

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:18.960
This might just be the first of several shows in Mexico?

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:25.920
They said in a conference before that they may or most probably will come next year again.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:26.920
Oh, nice.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.560
I bet you're excited about that.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.560
Yeah, pretty excited.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.920
Any advice you would have to give to folks that are going to be attending future video

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.920
game live shows?

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:43.440
Pretty much that any seat in the concert will give you a pretty good view, though on the

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.760
front will be a pretty good show.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.160
All right, very awesome.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.480
Well, I'm glad to hear you had a really good time at the show and you know what's funny?

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.320
I still have yet to see video games live.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.080
I just keep missing it every time it's in town, like something else is going on.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.080
It's sad.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.080
I really want to see it.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.200
I saw The Dear Friends, which is similar.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.160
I saw the Final Fantasy based one a while ago, but I will definitely catch video games

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.080
live next time I can, especially because I hear nothing but good things about it, so

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.080
I'll have to check it out.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.640
Akdefta, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.680
Just an article on Joystick.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.520
It was a report on Mexican game industry.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:30.200
They said that by 2010, the gaming industry in Mexico will increase by approximately I

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.520
think 10 million, 10 billion, excuse me.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:43.360
So apparently it's going to be increasing, though I find it kind of ironic that even

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:50.280
though the analysts think that it's going to increase in the economy, Mexico is one

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:59.640
of the leading markets in the world of piracy, games, music, movies, you name it.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:11.120
So I don't know how the industry will manage to beat that.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:15.080
Interesting perspective from somebody who's actually there in Mexico.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.480
Sometimes we read these stories and we don't really know what is.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.520
I guess my question for you is what is the gaming, actually let me ask you this, have

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.960
you ever visited the US?

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.960
Yes I have.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.440
Have you been able to kind of compare like the availability and the prevalence of gaming

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.920
here in the US versus Mexico?

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:44.020
Well, like in the United States you have GameStop, Baby Games, many video game stores here.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:52.800
We only have maybe one or two game stores and they're only located on the southern region

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.920
of the country.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:04.280
Most of the stores that carry games are like supermarkets like Walmart, for example, and

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:09.480
they don't have a great library of games, so it's pretty difficult to find a game you

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.480
like.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.860
Where do you get your games from?

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:19.160
I actually get my games from Sam's Club because they are pretty cheap and they have a great

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.160
library there.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:26.720
So I'm kind of liking that, but anywhere else I go I cannot find anything.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:34.120
So I actually have to get my games from online or I have to ask friends that go to the United

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.880
States to get them from me.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.680
To get them from you, well thankfully they run on the same televisions and pretty much

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.160
the Xboxes you get there are the same ones here so you don't have to worry about those

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.560
region-based issues.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.120
Always interesting to hear from our listeners in other countries and kind of hear about

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.560
the way the scene is there.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.560
So thanks so much.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.840
We've got to let you go active because we're running out of time, but thank you very much

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840
for the call.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.360
Yeah, thank you too.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360
Take care.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.880
We'll do one more call.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.200
We'll see who gets through here.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.200
We'll do some last minute stories.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.640
Do you have any last minute stories for us, Loki, when we get to that?

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.640
Yeah.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.640
All right, sounds good.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.320
Why don't you go ahead and read us the first one because...

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.320
Oh, no, never mind.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.320
We've got a call.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.240
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.240
Who's this?

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.520
Hello, Orange Lounge.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:23.640
This is the, what is it, the Norwegian, no, Norwegian, Swedish owl known as Akkeriper.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.720
Well, hello, Akkeriper.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.800
I see you in chat right now.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.840
I remember you calling in before.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.480
How are you doing?

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.720
I'm doing just fine.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:38.920
I'm, well, what, doing my wow drugs as usual, so...

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.920
What time is it?

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.680
It's got to be like, what, four or five in the morning over there?

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:53.400
It's like, what is it, five, five to, ah, I don't know, damn, I'm lost.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.500
It's around like five o'clock in the morning.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.880
He's up so late, he lost complete track of time.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.880
That's dedication.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880
I love it.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880
Well, what's on your mind?

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.880
What do we owe the phone call tonight?

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.920
Yeah, well, what is it?

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:11.160
I'm in the plans of buying a PSP for some weird reason, and I don't even know why, but

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:18.720
the reason is that I want to do a home brew on it, and I try to do some read up on it

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:24.920
on the web, and I'm completely lost on that front for some weird reason.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:34.680
I don't even know why, but, well, and since, what is it, since Loki has made his home brew

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:42.640
PSP, I think, if I remember right, I want to ask him, what is, what is, does he have

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.560
any kind of tip or so, what is so?

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.560
Good question.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.360
What is kind of the best way, if you're interested in doing some home brew on the PSP, what's

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.160
the best way to do that if you don't already own a PSP?

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.520
It's not very easy, because, especially with the new slim PSPs now, if you're getting one

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:01.620
of the fatter ones, it's easy to do it, because all you have to really do is, you know, up

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:07.020
downgrade the, you know, using any sort of exploit, either the Pandora's battery or

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.660
Grand Theft Auto, or Let me, let me say this first, I think part

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:13.360
of the reason it's so complicated is because of the fact that Sony keeps patching it with

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:17.880
every exploit that's found, it seems like there's 50 different ways to do it out there,

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.800
so Well, yeah, and really

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:26.840
One of the, pardon me, one of the reasons also is that there is actually a place where

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:37.320
you can buy a home brew enabled PSP for, what is it, like 2000 Swedish crowns, and you can

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:51.320
also buy an standard vanilla PSP for like 1600, and well, since I'm a sheep bastard,

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.800
I have the intention of just buying the vanilla, and then try to make some home brew version.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.420
I don't blame you, I don't blame you for being a PSP.

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:03.240
There's guys online to do the slim PSP, but what it's going to really take is you need

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.320
to have someone else that has one of the original PSPs, or has already made a Pandora's battery

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.800
for the slim one, and basically what you do, you have to have the old one to create the

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.120
Pandora's battery, then you patch it for the slim one, and then you run it on your slim.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:23.520
Should he try his luck and try to go buy a used PSP?

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.080
I would think the cheapest way to do it, try your luck in buying a used PSP, because a

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.120
used PSP is likely to have an older firmware still on it, depending on how long it's been

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.240
on the shelf, and that way you can make sure you get a fat PSP, too, and then you can use

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:44.320
either the Grand Theft Auto exploit, which still works, or this Pandora's battery thing,

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:49.040
but that's an extra cost to it, isn't it, because you have to buy a whole other battery?

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040
Sort of.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.040
You can buy the...

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.720
Okay, really quickly, what is the Pandora's battery?

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:59.120
Pandora's battery is basically you're running firmware or actual code off the battery, because

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.960
the battery itself actually has a little bit of data on it, and so what that does is it

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:09.640
pops it into a developer's mode and drops the firmware to whatever.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:16.440
It basically resets the whole PSP, and what they've done is kind of bootstrapped a downgrader

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:22.720
with this Pandora's battery, so it's allowed them to drop it down to 1.5, and then once

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:28.120
you have 1.5, you can up it to a custom firmware or something like that.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.880
It's not easy, and it's pretty confusing, but there are guides that take you step by

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.960
step on how to do it.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:41.760
QJNet has a pretty good guide and stuff, or at least they have links to find a guide like

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.760
that.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.240
I was just going to ask, are there any sites that you would recommend?

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:54.520
Because it sounds like probably like PSP Hacks or psp.qj.net, or I think pspupdates.qj.net,

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.880
they would have links.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.280
That's where I found mine, but it's been a long time since I did it.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.640
Once you do get a custom firmware on there, it's pretty easy, because now the stuff that

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:11.400
they put out, I guess it's the M33 firmwares, they're completely easy to upgrade.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:18.040
In fact, now they've got a built-in where you can just run an update via Wi-Fi and update

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:22.080
it over the web just like you would a normal psp.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.760
It's pretty simple once you've got that working to get a homebrew on there.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.520
Just getting it to that is pretty hard.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:34.720
Luckily, I had two psps, so I just used my old one to create the Pandora's Battery to

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.720
do it.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:45.920
What is more, in that way, that was just about what we were going to ask also.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:54.360
Since you can actually buy one with custom firmware already on it, how will it work when

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.920
you're going to have to do updates and stuff?

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:11.720
Well, I think I know the name of the game, but not LocoRoco, but the other one that's

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.720
coming.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.720
Padawan?

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:19.560
Yeah, what you're going to have to do, obviously you can't use any updates that are on UMD

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.440
disk, because that will corrupt your firmware, but what you're going to have to do is wait

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.840
for them to release these updates.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:31.640
But luckily though, most of the firmwares are cracked within a day or two at the most.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.560
Here's kind of the sad part though, is that if you want to do homebrew on the psp, it's

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.840
at the point now where you have to be pretty on top of it to do it.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.320
Loki, and here's something to consider, is that yeah, Loki might be a sort of homebrew

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.200
psp expert, but Loki, how many psps do you own?

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.200
Two.

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.040
And one is for homebrew and one is for current stuff, right?

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.040
Or something like that?

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.040
No.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.040
Oh, I thought that's how you did it.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.880
One I just don't use, and it's collecting dust, and it's one of the older ones, and the

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.600
other one is I can play new games on it, and I can play homebrew on it.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.600
Oh wow.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.960
It's the Slims, yeah.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.360
And you did the Pandora's Battery trick with it.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.360
Yeah.

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.360
Oh, okay.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.360
It was a pain in the ass though.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:09.320
It was really not fun, and luckily I had like an extra battery I bought, because I bought

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.920
a charger, a new charger for it, and it came with a battery, so I used that battery.

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.680
In fact, I think I still have my Pandora's Battery, but the thing is, also when you're

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:23.640
doing the Slim, the patched one does not fit on a 32 meg memory stick, so you need to make

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:28.080
sure you have at least one that's like 128 to be able to put the data on it, because

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.360
you have to have a memory stick and a battery that are basically linked together, and so

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.560
what will happen is when you pop that battery in, it will run that data that's on that memory

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.480
stick for you.

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480
It's really weird.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:44.000
Yeah, well, a memory card's not going to be a problem, since I actually have two memory

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.760
sticks, and I actually plan to buy it on an 8 gig version if I'm going to buy a PSP, so.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.760
Yeah.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.760
That's fine.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.240
So why say another battery or something, I mean, what will happen is once you've created

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:03.120
as a Pandora's Battery, it will, you can update your, or I guess back up your battery data

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:07.200
so that you can drop that battery back to a normal battery after it's done.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.520
It's kind of complicated, there's a lot of stuff on the internet, unfortunately I don't

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:17.200
remember exactly the steps to go to do it, but the information's definitely out there.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:23.320
I was going to say, if you're really lazy, you might be able to find a Pandora's Battery

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.320
on eBay.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.880
One last question, though, about playing with a PSP Slim on a big screen, how does that

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.760
work, or something?

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:38.160
Well, the Slim ones, you just need to buy a cable to do it, and pretty much it just

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.320
involves you plugging it in.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:43.000
The only problem is you're tethered to your TV, so.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.320
You need an extension or something like that, I guess?

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.880
Any extension cable for component or composite will work, it's just you're still tethered

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:56.680
to via a cord, although now they have a thing where they're going to come out with a remote

01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:01.440
dock if they're watching UMD movies or something like that that you can control it with a remote,

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.760
but still, though, it's going to be tethered to your TV.

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:08.960
Okay, Ripper, you're right, I've got to wrap things up, but do you have any other quick

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.520
final thoughts?

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:14.920
Nah, not that of so.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:23.400
I'm just a bit annoyed, just waiting for a 2.4 patch to come out, since apparently you

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:31.120
can start downloading the whole thing, so on Tuesday or Wednesday it's going to apparently

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.620
be patched to 2.4.

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:37.000
The background downloader is already active, my 2.4 is downloaded, I'm pretty sure it'll

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.960
go live either this Tuesday or next Tuesday, but we'll see, and of course we're talking

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.080
about Warcraft if you're going anywhere.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:45.520
Hey, real quick, you said you were from Sweden?

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.520
Yeah.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.480
Now, you know what I love most about Sweden?

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.920
I don't know, our royal house?

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.160
No, no.

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.160
ABBA.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.160
Oh, yeah.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.160
Oh, yeah.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.160
Don't stop.

01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.160
I love the music.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.160
All right.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:01.160
I seriously got to let you go.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.160
Yeah, well, I can't say.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.160
No, I know.

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.160
That was how many years ago, but it's timeless.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.160
Yeah, I did.

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.160
All right.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.160
Have a good one, buddy.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.160
Thank you.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.160
Bye.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.160
Bye.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.160
Bye.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.160
Bye, buddy.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.160
Thank you.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.160
That's it.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.160
Same to you too.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.160
Bye.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160
And of course the chat room's all, not ABBA.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:25.360
Since J-100 Matt says Rob went there, oh yes, I went there.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.040
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.280
We got to wrap up the show.

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.280
Mm-hmm.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.280
Good times.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.280
I'm sorry, Jamie.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.920
But ABBA, Jamie, ABBA.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:36.760
I remember when you were all antsy about getting to see Mamma Mia.

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.840
Hey, the movie is coming out.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840
I'll tell you what, I'm excited.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.840
All right.

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:41.840
I can't wait to see it.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.840
All right.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.840
We got to wrap up.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.840
Let's get everybody's final thought.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.320
Dark Soccer, you got like your keys in your hand.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.320
You're ready to roll, Dark Soccer.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.960
No, I'm trying to get to my thing so I can give you my cage match song.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:50.960
No, I'm kidding.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.080
What's your final thought today?

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:56.260
Reject false icons and buy me a fucking computer, buddy.

01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:58.040
My final thought is heartburn sucks.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.120
Loki, your final thought?

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:08.280
My final thought is, I don't know, I got to add people in Smash Brothers Brawl, I guess.

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:12.520
And Dark Tetsuya needs to add me on his Wii console so I can send him levels because he

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.040
was bitchy and they couldn't download any because he doesn't have an SD memory card,

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.360
which are dirt cheap by now.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.760
I should let you know.

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:22.040
By the way, speaking of custom levels, I heard you broke some type of record or something?

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.160
Well, I didn't break a record, but my level is in the top 20 downloadable levels for...

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.160
Ooh!

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160
Out of how many levels?

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.160
20?

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160
No, quite a few, actually.

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.160
Wow, good for you.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.160
Congrats.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.920
Are you selling the show somehow?

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.000
I made one and no one liked that level.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Oh, dope.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
What's the trick?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.040
The trick is to make stuff that looks like other things from pixel art type stuff, levels

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.040
that look like...

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.440
Mine was the question block level, so it looks like a question block from Mario Brothers.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.440
Gotcha.

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:51.440
All right.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.240
I have one other final thought for you guys.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.760
Oh, but before we get to that, I just want to say thank you so much, as always, for tuning

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.680
into and downloading and supporting independent podcasting.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.440
Remember, if you like Orange Launch Radio, all we ask, tell a friend or two about our

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.440
show.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.440
Spread the word.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.240
It's how we slowly take over the world.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:14.240
And I'll leave you with one last final, final thought, and then say good night.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:24.080
Good night.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.720
That music will never, ever get old.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.720
Erasure did a good cover.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:31.200
I don't care what you say.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.200
Thank you guys again.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.200
Have a great week.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:53.840
See you next time here on Orange Launch Radio.
