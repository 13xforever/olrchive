00:15.000 --> 00:19.500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.300
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Easter Sunday, March 23rd of 2008.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.500
We are live here in the studio.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.900
We had some unfortunate news a little earlier on.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.500
If you haven't heard it yet, go back and listen to part A.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.200
Big changes coming to OLR very soon.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.200
And hopefully next week we'll have more information on that for you.

00:39.200 --> 00:43.800
But in the meantime, the show goes on and it will go on as it always has.

00:43.800 --> 00:48.000
And it will go on right now with Loki spreading the rumors.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.000
Yes, and this rumor keeps coming back around.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.600
Remember last week we talked a bit about Reggie teasing

00:56.600 --> 01:00.400
that they're going to announce a major holiday blockbuster game

01:00.400 --> 01:04.200
that will be coming, or the announcement will be coming at E3.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.100
And of course, people are speculating on what the hell that is.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.800
We thought maybe Animal Crossing.

01:08.800 --> 01:14.800
However, some people over at IGN think it might be Kid Icarus because...

01:14.800 --> 01:16.600
Hey, wait a minute. That was my Dark Horse pick.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.800
Copiers? Plagiarists?

01:19.800 --> 01:24.300
But according to the latest Nintendo voice chat podcast,

01:24.300 --> 01:31.800
Matt Casamassina, and I guess the rest of their crew there,

01:31.800 --> 01:34.500
were speculating that they thought it was Kid Icarus

01:34.500 --> 01:36.200
because they know it's in the works.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.200
How do they know it's in the works?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.600
I don't fucking know, nor do I care.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.500
To be honest, as much as I think Kid Icarus is pretty cool,

01:45.500 --> 01:48.200
I don't think that's going to be a blockbuster game, you know what I mean?

01:48.200 --> 01:50.600
Unless it has Mario and shit in it.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.100
Unfortunately, the casual gamer out there,

01:53.100 --> 01:57.000
I mean, like your mom and pops, probably we don't give a shit about Kid Icarus.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.600
I don't know, I think you underestimate the fanboys.

02:00.600 --> 02:05.400
I would say that it'd be cool if a Kid Icarus game came out.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.100
I don't think it's the game he's talking about.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.200
I think Animal Crossing is the game he's talking about,

02:09.200 --> 02:11.200
but if there is a Kid Icarus game in the works,

02:11.200 --> 02:13.600
I mean, they'll be pretty big, but...

02:13.600 --> 02:17.200
I don't think it is the game that they're going to be announcing.

02:17.200 --> 02:20.600
I think it could be a game they're announcing.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.900
Yeah, a game, yes.

02:21.900 --> 02:23.200
The game, no.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.900
Well, then, Loki, consider this news, and we're going to come back and talk about this,

02:25.900 --> 02:27.300
but I want to get out this news,

02:27.300 --> 02:31.600
is that Super Smash Bros. Brawl shatters records everywhere.

02:31.600 --> 02:37.400
1.4 million sold in the first week it's been out in the US.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.900
That's crazy, 874,000 of those on the day it was released alone.

02:41.900 --> 02:46.600
That makes it the fastest selling video game in Nintendo of America's history,

02:46.600 --> 02:48.600
dating all the way back to the NES.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.700
And, you know, no surprise, this game was going to be a big seller,

02:51.700 --> 02:54.900
but this was a, like, really big seller.

02:54.900 --> 03:01.000
The game is sold at a rate of more than 120 units per minute

03:01.000 --> 03:04.400
between the day it launched, March 9th and March 16th.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.400
So that is a huge selling game.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.600
And RosteelUT, though, is the first to point out...

03:10.600 --> 03:12.800
He's Debbie Downer UT right now.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.900
He says, still slower than Halo 3.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.900
Wah, wah.

03:16.900 --> 03:20.400
But, I mean, it is kind of a good point.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.200
It didn't sell quite as much as some of the guys on Xbox did,

03:25.200 --> 03:27.700
but still a huge seller for Nintendo nonetheless.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.200
Yeah.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.000
And also you have to remember, too,

03:32.000 --> 03:37.300
that they don't have as many units of the Wii right now as they do the 360.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.300
They're still number two in the US.

03:40.300 --> 03:44.200
But, I mean, not by much, so that doesn't really make a big difference.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.500
Is it a big deal that it didn't meet up to those Halo 3-type numbers?

03:47.500 --> 03:51.400
No, I don't think they were ever...

03:51.400 --> 03:54.000
It made history for Nintendo,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.200
so I think that they're more than pleased about it.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.300
I don't think they really have to live up to being like Halo,

04:00.300 --> 04:01.500
because you know what?

04:01.500 --> 04:03.900
Fucking Grand Theft Auto's gonna outsell Halo anyways,

04:03.900 --> 04:07.200
so who gives a shit about your fucking Halo numbers right now?

04:07.200 --> 04:10.200
I mean, that's gonna get blown out of the water soon anyways.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.700
So, I don't know.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.100
And really, Halo 3, yeah, it sold a lot

04:14.100 --> 04:16.000
because there was so much hype behind it and shit,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.900
but was it really that great of a game?

04:18.900 --> 04:22.100
All right, so going back to the story earlier about Kid Icarus,

04:22.100 --> 04:24.800
would it be a game that people would recognize or not?

04:24.800 --> 04:26.000
This is a huge game.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.800
Pit is a character in the game.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.500
It does a good job at kind of reminding you that Kid Icarus is out there,

04:31.500 --> 04:35.200
what with the virtual console thing and the stages and the music.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.000
You know, it's one of the first things you see in Subspace Emissary,

04:38.000 --> 04:39.800
is the whole Pit coming to life thing.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.600
True, but does that mean we're also gonna get like a Rob the Robot,

04:42.600 --> 04:44.500
which I would totally buy that day.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.400
I would totally buy that day one, absolutely.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.500
Fuck yes, bring back Rob the Robot.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.900
In fact, make my old one compatible with the Wii.

04:52.900 --> 04:53.700
That would be cool,

04:53.700 --> 04:56.600
because then mine would actually be good for something other than sitting on the shelf.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.300
Yeah, I mean, like,

04:58.300 --> 05:01.000
can Rob do anything besides spin things?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.800
You know what they need to know?

05:02.800 --> 05:04.600
You know what they need to do with Rob the Robot?

05:04.600 --> 05:07.500
They need to make it like one of those fucking Robosapien things,

05:07.500 --> 05:10.200
or like fucking Furbies where you can program the shit out of that.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.400
Or the, uh, what, Ibo?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.800
Ibo, yeah.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.800
Just, like, something like that, just like really crazy, you know,

05:17.800 --> 05:20.900
get people to buy that shit that wouldn't have a Wii or something like that,

05:20.900 --> 05:22.800
and just go crazy with it.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.600
But, I mean, I don't know about you guys, but like,

05:24.600 --> 05:26.000
when I was playing Smash Brothers Brawl,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.800
and I played that Subspace Emissary mode,

05:27.800 --> 05:29.300
and I saw the Kid Icarus thing,

05:29.300 --> 05:32.800
and with the music and him flying through the air, flying down to Earth,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.500
and with the music playing, I'm like,

05:34.500 --> 05:36.700
God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game now.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.800
Like, that was initially the first thought in my mind,

05:38.800 --> 05:41.600
and I think we might have even been broadcasting on Justin.TV,

05:41.600 --> 05:43.100
uh, when, when I was doing that in the game,

05:43.100 --> 05:44.800
and I, I seem to remember exclaiming,

05:44.800 --> 05:47.800
God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game right now.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.100
Like, a new one.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.100
Maybe.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.800
I hope so.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.400
Uh, Tiger Claw says if they do the new Kid Icarus,

05:55.400 --> 05:58.800
it's no doubt that they would also have to bring back the Eggplant Wizard.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.400
Hell yes, the Eggplant Wizard was also a very memorable character.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.800
Everybody knew him as the annoyingest little fucker in video gaming history.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.400
One of the most annoying characters, seriously.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.600
You know what's great, though, about being turned into an eggplant, though?

06:10.600 --> 06:11.100
What?

06:11.100 --> 06:13.600
Is it if you press down to where you can see his feet,

06:13.600 --> 06:15.100
and then you slide across the floor as an eggplant?

06:15.100 --> 06:15.600
Yes.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.600
It's like, it's like, uh, Metal Gear Solid Eggplant.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.100
It's great!

06:20.100 --> 06:21.100
I know, I love that, too.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.600
You just hope that nothing saw you.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.600
And, and you can even hold it down and jump as an eggplant,

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
and that was great, too.

06:26.600 --> 06:30.600
And you, and, and who knew that hospitals could cure the eggplant curse?

06:30.600 --> 06:32.100
I know!

06:32.100 --> 06:36.600
Although, you could also turn into an eggplant from watching too much TV.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.600
This is true.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.600
Well, anyhow, uh, huge numbers for Smash Bros. Brawl,

06:41.600 --> 06:44.600
and I'm sure this game's just gonna continue to sell through Christmas,

06:44.600 --> 06:47.600
so, uh, we'll see how it holds up throughout the year.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.600
Well, in other news, dun dun dun.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.600
Okay, well,

06:54.600 --> 06:59.600
we know we were talking about how Namco was talking about, you know,

06:59.600 --> 07:02.600
not too many people are, uh, playing their games.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.600
Well, I should say Bandai Namco.

07:04.600 --> 07:09.600
Um, but now they're talking about, well, actually, they'd also blamed it on the Wii, too,

07:09.600 --> 07:10.600
which I think is kind of stupid.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.600
But now they're talking about, um, bringing out games, um,

07:14.600 --> 07:19.600
that will combine the arcade and Wii titles to where,

07:19.600 --> 07:25.600
I guess they'll, they'll share scores or that they'll have some sort of interactivity,

07:25.600 --> 07:29.600
but it would be for a data exchange between the different versions of the games.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
And you know what I have to say about that?

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
Neo Geo.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.100
And you know what I have to say about that?

07:34.100 --> 07:37.600
F-Zero GX.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.600
And you know what I have to say about that?

07:40.600 --> 07:43.600
Nothing. I just wanted to join in.

07:43.600 --> 07:49.600
No, seriously, though, I mean, they were part of the whole Triforce system that, you know,

07:49.600 --> 07:52.600
I think that was only pretty much used for the F-Zero GX stuff,

07:52.600 --> 07:58.600
but, uh, you know, it had cross, uh, platform stuff between, um, the arcade and the GameCube,

07:58.600 --> 08:01.600
so let's do something similar with SD memory cards,

08:01.600 --> 08:02.600
because those are widely available.

08:02.600 --> 08:08.100
Fuck, what, two gig memory card for, uh, $9.99 at Fry's today.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.100
That's pretty awesome.

08:09.100 --> 08:17.100
Um, but anyways, they've got, you know, they could do that very simple and exchange data back and forth.

08:17.100 --> 08:21.600
I think it's smart to make arcades like a gamer's hub,

08:21.600 --> 08:24.600
and I know that kind of sounds like a big duh type of answer,

08:24.600 --> 08:29.600
but I think it's smart to kind of make your arcade games somehow talk to the console games

08:29.600 --> 08:34.600
and give gamers a reason to sort of convene in one place, in real life, outside,

08:34.600 --> 08:37.600
you know, not having to use Xbox Live and rely on that type of stuff.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.600
I think these kind of ideas are smart.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.600
Can you imagine, like, a Smash Bros. arcade game or something like that,

08:42.600 --> 08:48.100
like, done on a huge screen, you know, with four, uh, joysticks, you know, set up and stuff,

08:48.100 --> 08:51.100
and then have, like, additional characters and all that stuff?

08:51.100 --> 08:55.600
Or things that unlock based on what you do on the home version, and things like that.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.100
Absolutely. That would be rad.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.100
sj100matt in chat says,

09:00.100 --> 09:02.100
Loki, one could dream.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.100
I agree, one could dream.

09:05.100 --> 09:08.100
So, we'll see what happens with this.

09:08.100 --> 09:13.100
Another cool thing that probably will never come to fruition, but, you know,

09:13.100 --> 09:16.100
at least with all the buzz that's going around about it,

09:16.100 --> 09:21.600
but a fan of Metroid 2 is actually working on a remake of the game

09:21.600 --> 09:24.600
that he's been working on right now for about three years now.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.600
Metroid 2 Return of Samus.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.100
Um, awesome looking thing.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.100
He's using sprites from Metroid Zero Mission,

09:32.100 --> 09:37.600
as well as the remake of the classic Game Boy game,

09:37.600 --> 09:39.100
and some other sprites.

09:39.100 --> 09:43.100
He's also hand-drawing from the ground-up, I guess, Metroid Fusion,

09:43.100 --> 09:45.100
which is the other game he's using,

09:45.100 --> 09:48.100
and using the program Game Maker 7,

09:48.100 --> 09:51.600
the guy who goes by Dr. M64,

09:51.600 --> 09:56.100
and totally awesome looking game so far.

09:56.100 --> 10:00.100
They've actually got a, I guess, not really a beta or demo,

10:00.100 --> 10:05.100
but a proof-of-concept demo, I guess, that you can download and play

10:05.100 --> 10:07.100
straight off of a bunch of websites,

10:07.100 --> 10:09.100
and if you're interested in checking it out,

10:09.100 --> 10:13.100
it's metroid2remake.blogspot.com for the website.

10:13.100 --> 10:17.100
And we have a little YouTube that TigerClaw sent us of this in action.

10:17.100 --> 10:23.100
Neat, looks like Super Metroid.

10:26.100 --> 10:29.100
I imagine that's not the sound in-game.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.100
No, they actually do have an in-game...

10:31.100 --> 10:33.100
I don't think this is it, though, is it?

10:33.100 --> 10:35.100
No, that's the actual game, but that's not the...

10:35.100 --> 10:37.100
Damn, the game looks good, though.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.100
It looks like Super Metroid.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.100
That's not a bad thing.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.100
Nice wall jumping.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.100
I approve. This looks good.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.100
Yeah, I hope the project doesn't get shut down by players or something.

10:56.100 --> 10:59.100
Oh, there you have it.

11:02.100 --> 11:05.100
Mackman says, oh shit, I thought it was going to be a Rickroll.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.100
No, I trust TigerClaw's links.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.100
Some of you other people, I don't know so much.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.100
I might get Rickrolled by you,

11:11.100 --> 11:14.100
so don't think I'm not going to check.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.100
Rickroll, you get blacklisted.

11:16.100 --> 11:19.100
That's right, you Rickroll me, I ban you.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.100
That shit was funny like three months ago.

11:21.100 --> 11:25.100
It's a little old now, so please do not be Rickrolling.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.100
Anyhow, Metroid 2, yes, I approve.

11:28.100 --> 11:31.100
And I hope the project doesn't get Rickrolled by lawyers.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.100
That would suck.

11:32.100 --> 11:36.100
Just like, was it the 3D remake of Chrono Trigger?

11:36.100 --> 11:37.100
That sucks.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.100
Oh, that thing looked hot, too.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.100
You remember seeing that that game looked hot.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.100
They apparently are making the full version.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.100
The people they're working on, they're going to make it for themselves,

11:45.100 --> 11:47.100
but they can't release it because...

11:47.100 --> 11:50.100
Oh, that shit will end up a bit torn so fast.

11:50.100 --> 11:53.100
Well, they still could get in trouble, I think.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.100
Yeah.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.100
All right, anyhow, today is Easter,

11:57.100 --> 11:59.100
and so I guess this news is going to be a little bit old

11:59.100 --> 12:01.100
for some of our podcast listeners,

12:01.100 --> 12:03.100
but this is just too cool.

12:03.100 --> 12:06.100
Some people were seeing this earlier this week.

12:06.100 --> 12:11.100
Nintendo Miis, as in the characters that you create on Wiis,

12:11.100 --> 12:15.100
were being used to advertise Easter service at a San Francisco church.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.100
Yes, that's right.

12:16.100 --> 12:19.100
They used a little Mii that looks like Jesus

12:19.100 --> 12:22.100
standing next to a bunny that looks a little grumpy,

12:22.100 --> 12:24.100
and the little postcard says,

12:24.100 --> 12:28.100
Come and Follow Mii, M-I-I.

12:28.100 --> 12:31.100
And it was Easter Sunday, which was today at 11 a.m.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.100
at the Mission Bay Community Church.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.100
So, you know, just clever ways of advertising.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.100
And, you know, I like churches that are hip and with it,

12:39.100 --> 12:42.100
and I like churches that don't feel like

12:42.100 --> 12:43.100
they're still living in the Old Testament.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.100
Did you see the one that was the wedding invitation

12:45.100 --> 12:47.100
that had the two Miis on there?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.100
No, I don't think I saw that.

12:48.100 --> 12:52.100
And then when you open it up, it says, Wife Get.

12:52.100 --> 12:56.100
That's awesome.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.100
That's awesome.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.100
That sounds like something that Mel and Mel,

13:00.100 --> 13:03.100
my buddies would be doing for their wedding.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.100
Sounds like something they would do.

13:06.100 --> 13:10.100
Nice.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.100
That actually, yeah.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.100
That is very cute.

13:13.100 --> 13:17.100
I like cute, innovative ways of doing things.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.100
All right, bless you.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.100
Are you okay?

13:19.100 --> 13:21.100
I'm allergic to...

13:21.100 --> 13:22.100
Something here in the studio?

13:22.100 --> 13:23.100
Are you allergic to me?

13:23.100 --> 13:24.100
Are you allergic to Jesus?

13:24.100 --> 13:26.100
That might be a problem.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.100
Mildly.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.100
All right.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.100
Well, hopefully you're not allergic to mail

13:30.100 --> 13:32.100
because this is the part of the show

13:32.100 --> 13:34.100
where you're going to read some for us

13:34.100 --> 13:35.100
as the listeners email us

13:35.100 --> 13:39.100
at mailbag at orangesonsradio.com.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.100
Did we get better participation this week than last week?

13:42.100 --> 13:45.100
Well, we did get some interesting emails

13:45.100 --> 13:48.100
and one of them is from our friend Rob Booktubes,

13:48.100 --> 13:52.100
but he didn't provide the link to the article in the email,

13:52.100 --> 13:55.100
so he's basically just talking about an article

13:55.100 --> 13:57.100
about the outcome of the guy who,

13:57.100 --> 13:58.100
I'm just going to read this from the start.

13:58.100 --> 14:01.100
Here's a pretty good article on the outcome of that guy

14:01.100 --> 14:04.100
who bludgeoned a baby to death for accidentally breaking the Xbox.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.100
Some interesting stuff in that article.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.100
One, the article does not imply

14:09.100 --> 14:11.100
the guy was playing his Xbox at the time.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.100
Two, the article does not specify

14:13.100 --> 14:15.100
if the murder happened immediately after the Xbox broke

14:15.100 --> 14:17.100
or when Spellman the convicted discovered it.

14:17.100 --> 14:21.100
Three, social workers visited the house regularly

14:21.100 --> 14:24.100
and four, the autopsy showed evidence of prior abuse.

14:24.100 --> 14:27.100
It implies a pattern of abuse that shows the man

14:27.100 --> 14:29.100
was a ticking time bomb.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.100
As you said when the story probably came out,

14:31.100 --> 14:33.100
it wasn't really about games at all.

14:33.100 --> 14:37.100
So...

14:37.100 --> 14:38.100
Exactly.

14:38.100 --> 14:41.100
Pretty much, you know, it's no surprise

14:41.100 --> 14:44.100
that the media, you know, hopped all over this

14:44.100 --> 14:45.100
trying to make it a video game thing

14:45.100 --> 14:47.100
when it really had nothing to do with that.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.100
No surprise there.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.100
But thanks for the update, nevertheless.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.100
I'm not saying that at you.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.100
I'm just saying that in general.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.100
Like, here goes the media again.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.100
Video games are evil.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.100
Blah, blah, blah.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.100
Big surprise.

14:59.100 --> 15:04.100
Well, also, Nige linked me a story on CBBC

15:04.100 --> 15:07.100
that is actually pretty cool.

15:07.100 --> 15:13.100
It's more just pictures of a bunch of people.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.100
A lot of people dressed up as Mario,

15:15.100 --> 15:19.100
but also others dressed up as different characters.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.100
Like, there's a giant Spyro here,

15:21.100 --> 15:22.100
a very well-made costume,

15:22.100 --> 15:24.100
just walking around that says

15:24.100 --> 15:26.100
they're trying to break a record,

15:26.100 --> 15:27.100
but I don't see...

15:27.100 --> 15:29.100
They broke a record for the most cosplayers

15:29.100 --> 15:30.100
in one spot, I guess,

15:30.100 --> 15:31.100
or something like 80.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.100
It was just 80 cosplayers.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.100
What?

15:34.100 --> 15:38.100
I think the average anime convention

15:38.100 --> 15:41.100
could break that, like, in a heartbeat.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.100
I think specifically, though,

15:43.100 --> 15:45.100
that these are all video game characters.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.100
Speaking of anime conventions,

15:47.100 --> 15:49.100
I was told via a text message earlier this week,

15:49.100 --> 15:51.100
I don't know if it actually ended up happening or not,

15:51.100 --> 15:53.100
because I didn't get any text messages tonight,

15:53.100 --> 15:55.100
but I'm being told that our show is right now

15:55.100 --> 15:57.100
being played at Anime Boston.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.100
So if that's true,

15:58.100 --> 16:00.100
a big hello to you kids at Anime Boston.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.100
And you know who sent me a text message,

16:02.100 --> 16:05.100
so I know for a fact you guys are listening in there,

16:05.100 --> 16:07.100
because I don't see anybody in chat or what have you.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.100
But then again, my phone's in the house,

16:08.100 --> 16:10.100
so maybe that's what happened.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.100
Well, if you've got the mind, text me.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.100
Yeah, there you go.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.100
Well, that's pretty cool.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.100
Hi, people.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.100
And here's the thing.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.100
What you need to do right now,

16:18.100 --> 16:20.100
or not right now because you're listening to the show,

16:20.100 --> 16:21.100
but as soon as the show's over,

16:21.100 --> 16:23.100
all you bitches need to get your cosplay gear on

16:23.100 --> 16:27.100
and get 81 of you together and shatter the record.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.100
Do it.

16:28.100 --> 16:31.100
Dude, I would participate in that one

16:31.100 --> 16:33.100
if I had a finished costume right now.

16:33.100 --> 16:37.100
Yeah, the record was for the largest gathering of game characters,

16:37.100 --> 16:39.100
or games characters.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.100
All right, so you guys have to dig through your luggage

16:41.100 --> 16:43.100
and get your game ones specifically.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.100
Just gather a whole crap load of Guilty Gear cosplayers.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.100
You'll be happy and done.

16:47.100 --> 16:50.100
And remember, would Naruto count?

16:50.100 --> 16:52.100
Because technically they have Naruto games,

16:52.100 --> 16:55.100
but Naruto is an anime character.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.100
That's kind of a gray area.

16:56.100 --> 17:00.100
In fact, a lot of anime characters are games in Japan, right?

17:00.100 --> 17:02.100
I think it counts.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.100
Next email.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.100
All right, yes, next email.

17:05.100 --> 17:07.100
And this is from GS68.

17:07.100 --> 17:11.100
Hey, O.O.R. Crew, since Dark Sakura,

17:11.100 --> 17:15.100
if I recall correctly, isn't going to fight on me this year,

17:15.100 --> 17:17.100
will you still do a panel there?

17:17.100 --> 17:20.100
It's one of the things I looked forward to last year.

17:20.100 --> 17:23.100
If we are invited to, then yes.

17:23.100 --> 17:25.100
I don't see why not.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.100
Do we always submit?

17:26.100 --> 17:27.100
I thought somebody submitted for us.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.100
You always have to submit.

17:28.100 --> 17:30.100
I submitted the last two years.

17:30.100 --> 17:32.100
Are they accepting right now?

17:32.100 --> 17:33.100
Yes.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.100
Oh, I guess we have to submit then.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.100
I don't know.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.100
Loki, are we still going to do a panel?

17:36.100 --> 17:37.100
Sure, I can try that.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.100
Why not?

17:38.100 --> 17:40.100
We'll bring a mannequin.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.100
I'll let you take one of my doffies.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.100
And put an angry face on it.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.100
We'll say it's Chibi.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.100
I'll make you a very small doffie to take with you.

17:45.100 --> 17:48.100
Yeah, we'll still do a panel if they'll let us.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.100
Why not?

17:50.100 --> 17:51.100
Well, next email.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.100
Hello, it's DJ Jinai again.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.100
Thanks for reading my email last week.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.100
I was surprised.

17:56.100 --> 18:00.100
I knew about the Smile DK news for a good month.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.100
As soon as it was okay to release the news to the public,

18:02.100 --> 18:04.100
O.O.R. was the first place I went to tell.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.100
A bit about me.

18:05.100 --> 18:08.100
Yes, I'm an actual DJ and I live in Las Vegas.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.100
Arcades are still alive here.

18:10.100 --> 18:12.100
I usually mix anime and video game music.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.100
But when it comes to DJ anime conventions,

18:14.100 --> 18:17.100
I got my start as a DJ at Fanime Con 2002.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.100
That's cool.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.100
I'll be going to San Japan Con to meet with Smile DK.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.100
I might faint when I meet them.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.100
Hee hee.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.100
Other conventions I'll be attending are

18:27.100 --> 18:29.100
AntiJam in Fresno, California

18:29.100 --> 18:33.100
and Anime Vegas Con in, wait for it, Las Vegas, Gasp.

18:33.100 --> 18:36.100
So yes, I have a Wii and I will be waiting for Mario Kart Wii.

18:36.100 --> 18:39.100
I'm surprised that they removed snaking.

18:39.100 --> 18:43.100
Well, I'll find another new strategy to overcome that mwahaha.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.100
I'm also surprised at how easy it is to find Brawl

18:46.100 --> 18:49.100
and still no Wii consoles to be found.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.100
I haven't eaten at Olive Garden yet.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.100
I want to have my first Olive Garden experience with O.L.R.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.100
I can only dream.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.100
Bye, DJ Genai.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.100
P.S. You pronounce my name right.

18:58.100 --> 19:01.100
You win an internet and a Mudkip X3.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.100
You know, ironically enough,

19:02.100 --> 19:04.100
I might actually be going to Vegas in a couple months,

19:04.100 --> 19:05.100
so it's on.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.100
Olive Garden like what?

19:07.100 --> 19:08.100
There's a good Olive Garden in town,

19:08.100 --> 19:11.100
which I hope there's got to be in Las Vegas, right?

19:11.100 --> 19:12.100
There's got to be.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.100
There's got to be an Olive Garden.

19:13.100 --> 19:16.100
No, there's no Olive Garden in Las Vegas.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.100
That would suck.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.100
Suck for Vegas.

19:19.100 --> 19:23.100
So I'm like, I seem to recall I was in the middle of BFE Pennsylvania

19:23.100 --> 19:24.100
and there was an Olive Garden there.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.100
I wouldn't be surprised if there was the Olive Garden casino in the works.

19:26.100 --> 19:30.100
DJ Genai is in chat and says, yes, there is an Olive Garden.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.100
If I get three breadsticks,

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
does the machine spit out never-ending breadsticks?

19:33.100 --> 19:35.100
And Sauce confirmed that there are a few.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.100
Thank you.

19:37.100 --> 19:41.100
And the reason I pronounced your name right is because I'm not Rob.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.100
Rob Steele, shut up.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.100
And Rob Steele UT has a good point.

19:46.100 --> 19:50.100
He says, why would you go to Vegas and then go to Olive's shithouse?

19:50.100 --> 19:53.100
That's actually a good point because Vegas has so many great restaurants.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.100
Why the fuck would I go to Olive Garden?

19:54.100 --> 19:55.100
I'll tell you where I would want to go.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.100
Where?

19:56.100 --> 20:01.100
I would want to go to the Rio and go to the seafood buffet,

20:01.100 --> 20:06.100
the massive seafood buffet that I went to on the DDR Freak moderator trip

20:06.100 --> 20:08.100
that ate a lot of my money.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.100
I need to go back to Quark's Bar.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.100
Get me a warp core breach.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.100
I can do one of those myself.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.100
I am so going to Vegas in a couple months.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.100
I can't wait.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.100
I want to go.

20:17.100 --> 20:19.100
My 30th birthday.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.100
I still have to get you your present, you know.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.100
I know.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.100
I already bought you your present.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.100
Your birthday's not until next month.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.100
I am.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.100
Well, I love my present, but I have a special present for you

20:28.100 --> 20:32.100
that falls in line with my present from my 30th.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.100
Sweet.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.100
I'll be looking forward to that.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.100
I'll be looking forward to helping you with it.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.100
All right.

20:39.100 --> 20:42.100
No, we have more e-mails.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.100
Yay.

20:43.100 --> 20:47.100
If you are ready for said e-mail.

20:47.100 --> 20:50.100
This is, hey guys, let's have tea here.

20:50.100 --> 20:51.100
Cool, I'd like some tea.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.100
Thank you.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.100
Oh, wish I could be listening live tonight,

20:54.100 --> 20:56.100
but I'm on a plane right now flying home,

20:56.100 --> 21:01.100
so there's not really internet access on airplanes.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.100
Anyhow, years back, Rob did a review on trace memory

21:04.100 --> 21:05.100
for the Nintendo DS.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.100
Trace memory is actually called another code

21:07.100 --> 21:10.100
outside the US for any international listeners,

21:10.100 --> 21:13.100
and he went off on how amazing the game is.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.100
After I heard that episode, I went out and bought the game,

21:15.100 --> 21:17.100
and I agree with his reaction to it.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.100
It was an amazing game.

21:19.100 --> 21:22.100
Recently, I found a game that was made by the same company.

21:22.100 --> 21:26.100
Hotel Duskroom 215 uses DS in the same way that trace memory did,

21:26.100 --> 21:28.100
but with a little more guidance to it.

21:28.100 --> 21:31.100
Oftentimes, in trace memory, I'd get lost and confused,

21:31.100 --> 21:34.100
but that rarely happened in Hotel Dusk.

21:34.100 --> 21:37.100
The puzzles in Hotel Dusk are generally pretty neat

21:37.100 --> 21:39.100
and are excellent ways to use the touch screen.

21:39.100 --> 21:41.100
The game is so incredibly well written

21:41.100 --> 21:44.100
that it feels like you're actually interacting with the other people in the hotel.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.100
Excuse me.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.100
And for those of you who have no clue what trace memory is,

21:48.100 --> 21:52.100
it's a point-and-click adventure game that uses the DS hardware to the fullest.

21:52.100 --> 21:55.100
The game is filled with all sorts of little puzzles that you have to solve,

21:55.100 --> 21:57.100
and most of them are very well thought out.

21:57.100 --> 22:00.100
There's even one puzzle where you have to shut the DS

22:00.100 --> 22:03.100
just so that you can see the reflection from one side of the screen and the other

22:03.100 --> 22:07.100
in order to understand a riddle.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.100
At any rate, check out both of these games.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.100
Very goodbyes.

22:12.100 --> 22:15.100
Take care, and please don't forget to save the podcast feed.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.100
I'll need something to listen to on the flight back.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got it taken care of now.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.100
You know what's funny?

22:22.100 --> 22:27.100
I've never played trace memory, so I don't know how I reviewed it on the show.

22:27.100 --> 22:30.100
I have a feeling it was Miklotov that played it.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.100
Yeah, it wasn't him.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.100
I think it was Miklotov, not me.

22:34.100 --> 22:41.100
And I've been advised that you need to go to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.100
Ooh, Margaritas. I'm down with that.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.100
Okay.

22:44.100 --> 22:46.100
So, last email.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.100
No!

22:47.100 --> 22:49.100
I need tragic music for this.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.100
Anyway.

22:51.100 --> 22:56.100
What was the song in Beatmania 4th Mix that was the Gothi song?

22:56.100 --> 22:58.100
I don't know.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.100
Hey, OLR. Shout-on here.

23:00.100 --> 23:04.100
I was going through some old episodes somewhere in the late 100s,

23:04.100 --> 23:11.100
and noticed that Rob at one point brought up Feel the Magic and repeatedly griped about Sprung.

23:11.100 --> 23:13.100
This got me thinking.

23:13.100 --> 23:18.100
Have any of you ever been interested in the visual novel genre?

23:18.100 --> 23:20.100
Not many visual novels have been brought over to the US,

23:20.100 --> 23:24.100
the Ace Attorney series being among the most well-known one on American shores.

23:24.100 --> 23:29.100
However, many more visual novels that are, in my opinion,

23:29.100 --> 23:33.100
vastly superior to the Ace Attorney series are unlikely to be released outside of Japan,

23:33.100 --> 23:38.100
even though it wouldn't be a big deal to edit them like with many other games.

23:38.100 --> 23:42.100
So I guess the main question of this paragraph would be whether or not any of you,

23:42.100 --> 23:47.100
mainly Jamie, have imported or pirated Japanese visual novels such as Fate,

23:47.100 --> 23:51.100
Stay Night, Tsukihime, or Clannad,

23:51.100 --> 23:54.100
two of which have been fairly popular anime based off of them.

23:54.100 --> 23:58.100
I mean, FSN and Clannad, there was no Tsukihime anime.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.100
Was that just fan art?

24:00.100 --> 24:04.100
Actually, I did have one, and I actually heard of this one when the Sega CD was new,

24:04.100 --> 24:07.100
and it was called Takaru.

24:07.100 --> 24:14.100
I had remembered seeing that they were going to bring it out in the US,

24:14.100 --> 24:17.100
but it never did on Sega CD, if I recall correctly.

24:17.100 --> 24:20.100
However, I have a PC version of it that's fully translated.

24:20.100 --> 24:24.100
I've definitely heard of Clannad before, but I haven't played it myself.

24:24.100 --> 24:27.100
I've heard of the band.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.100
Yeah, I hope I'm not getting confused with the band.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.100
No, I'm pretty sure I'm not. I've heard of the game.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.100
I think that's Enya's sister.

24:33.100 --> 24:39.100
Anyway, there's a few of them that I've heard of,

24:39.100 --> 24:46.100
and they sort of did something like that one for the Silent Hill comics too,

24:46.100 --> 24:48.100
at least they tried to, but it didn't.

24:48.100 --> 24:52.100
It was more just like, oh, we're going to have dramatic music with the comic book panels.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.100
Okay, so that wasn't quite the same thing.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.100
Anyway, moving forward.

24:56.100 --> 24:59.100
Anyway, the next question involves an email you received last week

24:59.100 --> 25:03.100
that concerned the length of arcade shooters like Gradius being too short.

25:03.100 --> 25:07.100
I completely agree with Jamie that taking the time to get a high score or play through

25:07.100 --> 25:11.100
on one credit in games like these gives bragging rights.

25:11.100 --> 25:15.100
This is doubly true of much more difficult games like Japanese Danmaku

25:15.100 --> 25:23.100
or bullet hell shooters like Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, or Mushihime-sama.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.100
So this leads to my next question.

25:25.100 --> 25:31.100
Have any of you ever played any games from the popular PC Danmaku shooter series Toho?

25:31.100 --> 25:36.100
The Toho game started on the PC-98 with a game called Highly Responsive to Prayers.

25:36.100 --> 25:41.100
The game series features a perpetual protagonist named Reimu Hakurei,

25:41.100 --> 25:48.100
a Miko who operates an unpopular and out-of-the-way shrine in the land called Gensokyo.

25:48.100 --> 25:52.100
Toho's first appearance on Windows was the embodiment of Scarlet Devil,

25:52.100 --> 25:56.100
so if it catches your interest, I would recommend starting with that.

25:56.100 --> 26:00.100
The games are very popular for their music, art style, and curtains fire pattern

26:00.100 --> 26:04.100
and sense of inner game character development.

26:04.100 --> 26:08.100
The games are available for free download on doujinstyle.com,

26:08.100 --> 26:16.100
and I would definitely advise anyone who still has fond memories of Radiant Silver Gun to check the series out.

26:16.100 --> 26:19.100
Keep up your exemplary work, Charon.

26:19.100 --> 26:24.100
I have not played those games, but due to that well-worded free plug, I just might.

26:24.100 --> 26:38.100
I'm familiar with Toho's games, but if it was PC, I hardly played it, so I was more of a... I'd brought up Bongayo before. That was one of my favorites.

26:38.100 --> 26:43.100
I mean, it was more of a recent one, but I like those kinds of games.

26:43.100 --> 26:47.100
Actually, I really, really love Radiant Silver Gun.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.100
Alright, well then this sounds like something you ought to check out, too.

26:50.100 --> 26:56.100
Well, I was actually pretty thrilled that when, um, that had the aforementioned DDR Freak moderatorship.

26:56.100 --> 27:01.100
We went to this place called, um, I want to say Game Land?

27:01.100 --> 27:08.100
They've gone out of business since. This was probably in 2000... something?

27:08.100 --> 27:10.100
I don't really remember when.

27:10.100 --> 27:13.100
Um, but I found a Radiant Silver Gun arcade machine.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.100
And played the hell out of it!

27:15.100 --> 27:19.100
Everyone's like, ooh, Mambo a Go-Go! Let's go play that!

27:19.100 --> 27:21.100
And I'm like, fuck no! I played that, and uh...

27:21.100 --> 27:23.100
Mambo a Go-Go was kind of cool, though.

27:23.100 --> 27:29.100
It is. But I was too busy on Radiant Silver Gun and Biohazard Gun Survivor 2.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.100
Ah.

27:32.100 --> 27:34.100
Alright, so that's it for the emails?

27:34.100 --> 27:35.100
Yes.

27:35.100 --> 27:37.100
Then you have to say, no more emails.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.100
No more emails!

27:42.100 --> 27:44.100
That's the best ever.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.100
You said you wanted some type of sound effects.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.100
That was really tragic. That's more humorous.

27:48.100 --> 27:52.100
Alright, if you want to send us an email,

27:52.100 --> 27:55.100
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send them.

27:55.100 --> 27:58.100
Meanwhile, we get back into the news, don't we, Loki?

27:58.100 --> 28:00.100
Yes, we do.

28:00.100 --> 28:04.100
Um, so, hopefully you haven't bought this already,

28:04.100 --> 28:06.100
because if you did, you just wasted some money,

28:06.100 --> 28:14.100
but, um, Bungie is now going to be putting out the Halo 3 Legendary Map Pack.

28:14.100 --> 28:17.100
I believe it was previously $10.

28:17.100 --> 28:19.100
Um, and included three maps.

28:19.100 --> 28:23.100
Out for free, starting at 2 AM this Tuesday.

28:23.100 --> 28:26.100
So, that sucks.

28:26.100 --> 28:29.100
But, um, hey, it's free.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.100
And, um, you know what, though?

28:31.100 --> 28:35.100
If you're still interested in spending some money on maps,

28:35.100 --> 28:37.100
there are some more coming the next Map Pack,

28:37.100 --> 28:41.100
which is going to include a Sign Winder remake,

28:41.100 --> 28:43.100
or I guess a spiritual remake,

28:43.100 --> 28:47.100
including other ones known as Ghost Town,

28:47.100 --> 28:51.100
and one other mystery map, I guess.

28:51.100 --> 28:56.100
That's going to be coming on the 15th of April.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.100
Or if you're like me, you're like,

28:58.100 --> 29:00.100
Halo 3 got new maps?

29:00.100 --> 29:01.100
Yeah.

29:01.100 --> 29:04.100
Like, I stopped playing Halo 3 months ago.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.100
Now you can go download them,

29:06.100 --> 29:09.100
and then you might as well wait until these maps become free as well,

29:09.100 --> 29:10.100
because, you know.

29:10.100 --> 29:12.100
Yeah, no, I only download them after they're free.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.100
I don't need to pay for them.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.100
And, like, I don't know.

29:15.100 --> 29:17.100
I used to play Halo 2 with my college buddies a lot,

29:17.100 --> 29:18.100
but we really haven't been playing Halo 3.

29:18.100 --> 29:19.100
It's kind of sad.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.100
Well, what was it?

29:20.100 --> 29:22.100
They had a map that they released in the last Map Pack

29:22.100 --> 29:24.100
that I want to say was empty,

29:24.100 --> 29:27.100
and it was just this big empty warehouse that you could build stuff with.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.100
Nice.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.100
And it's like, you know,

29:30.100 --> 29:32.100
but you can build all these cool things and forge with it.

29:32.100 --> 29:35.100
It's like, thanks, but you really didn't do anything.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.100
You just made an empty warehouse, you idiot.

29:37.100 --> 29:40.100
So, I don't know.

29:40.100 --> 29:43.100
All right, well, you can check that out soon.

29:43.100 --> 29:46.100
One guy who might actually be back into checking this out

29:46.100 --> 29:51.100
was the really depressed guy who had his Xbox 360 ruined by Microsoft.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.100
Do you remember this?

29:53.100 --> 29:56.100
He had his personalized 360.

29:56.100 --> 29:59.100
It was white clean when he did the whole Red Ring of Death fix.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.100
Remember that?

30:00.100 --> 30:01.100
Yeah.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.100
They cleared it all away.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.100
PR Nightmare, this story ended up on blogs everywhere.

30:05.100 --> 30:08.100
Well, guess what?

30:08.100 --> 30:13.100
Apparently, a recent delivery has come from Microsoft back to the same guy.

30:13.100 --> 30:17.100
It came with an Xbox 360, a handful of games,

30:17.100 --> 30:21.100
and what you should definitely pay attention to is that this new Xbox 360

30:21.100 --> 30:24.100
was signed by the entire Xbox team,

30:24.100 --> 30:31.100
Bungie, which had also replacement artwork on it by Rooster Teeth Comics' Luke McKay,

30:31.100 --> 30:34.100
and Bill Gates signed the front of it.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.100
So, he got more than he had before.

30:36.100 --> 30:40.100
Yeah, he got a care package from Bungie and also from Microsoft.

30:40.100 --> 30:44.100
Way to kiss ass.

30:44.100 --> 30:47.100
So, this will probably be the last time you ever hear about this story on the blogs,

30:47.100 --> 30:50.100
and now everyone everywhere is screaming,

30:50.100 --> 30:52.100
Microsoft, fuck up my 360.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.100
I want a cool little care package like this.

30:55.100 --> 30:58.100
Dude, the art's pretty cool on it.

30:58.100 --> 31:00.100
Yeah, that's pretty rad.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.100
Watch this guy just turn around and sell it on eBay.

31:02.100 --> 31:04.100
That would be tragic.

31:04.100 --> 31:07.100
That would be funny.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.100
I want them to draw on my Xbox now.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.100
Anyway.

31:12.100 --> 31:15.100
They should have a service where you can send in your Xbox and get it drawn on.

31:15.100 --> 31:17.100
I guess that is a little silly.

31:17.100 --> 31:22.100
I would be happy to provide that service.

31:22.100 --> 31:28.100
You pay me $200 and I will customize your Xbox 360 with a Sharpie.

31:28.100 --> 31:30.100
Although I'm actually not joking.

31:30.100 --> 31:32.100
Send me your faceplate and I'll customize it.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.100
If that is a contest, we should get a blank faceplate.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.100
They have blank faceplates, right?

31:36.100 --> 31:38.100
We can customize it somehow.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.100
We have some of the Ace Combat ones that we can paint over.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.100
Okay, that'll work.

31:41.100 --> 31:45.100
Well, you can just get a faceplate off of a core system or something,

31:45.100 --> 31:47.100
and they're white.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.100
Oh, there you go.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.100
Or actually all the original faceplates are white.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.100
That might be fun.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.100
Something to do.

31:53.100 --> 31:54.100
I have some extra ones.

31:54.100 --> 31:56.100
All right, anyway.

31:56.100 --> 32:00.100
Well, there's some information that's out now about Bionic Commando Re-Armed,

32:00.100 --> 32:08.100
which is the 2D-style Bionic Commando that they're coming out with.

32:08.100 --> 32:12.100
The title is supposed to be out in May,

32:12.100 --> 32:18.100
and it will be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade for $10, American.

32:18.100 --> 32:22.100
And there will be a PC version, but they don't have a price on it yet.

32:22.100 --> 32:28.100
But the Xbox Live version is going to actually be for 800 Microsoft points.

32:28.100 --> 32:33.100
The PlayStation Network one is $10.

32:33.100 --> 32:40.100
And that it will, for the PC version anyway, it will require Windows XP or Vista.

32:40.100 --> 32:42.100
I'm so sorry.

32:42.100 --> 32:49.100
At least 512 megabytes of RAM and 650 megabytes of hard drive space.

32:49.100 --> 32:55.100
And it may or may not have unique content.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.100
It may or may not.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.100
Well, thank you for covering the full spectrum of possibilities.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.100
This game may or may not be good.

33:01.100 --> 33:03.100
I have more information.

33:03.100 --> 33:11.100
The minimum specs on this is XP Service Pack 2 or Vista.

33:11.100 --> 33:16.100
I have a Pentium 4 2 gigahertz or an AMD XP 2200.

33:16.100 --> 33:20.100
512 megabytes of RAM, 650 megabytes of hard drive space.

33:20.100 --> 33:27.100
128 megabyte DirectX 9C compatible card or NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or ATI equivalent.

33:27.100 --> 33:31.100
DirectX 9 compatible sound card, internet connection, keyboard, mouse.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.100
Their recommended ones are actually quite a bit better.

33:33.100 --> 33:39.100
But, you know, honestly, why?

33:39.100 --> 33:40.100
Okay.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.100
I guess there's like, you can download minimum content

33:43.100 --> 33:48.100
or you can have like the maximum content that's saying you want 2 gigs of hard drive space.

33:48.100 --> 33:51.100
I think it's just the minimum requirements versus the maximum.

33:51.100 --> 33:54.100
You can either install the entire game off the DVD

33:54.100 --> 34:00.100
or you could just run it off the DVD and some of it on the hard drive.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.100
Whatever.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.100
So, it's kind of interesting though.

34:04.100 --> 34:10.100
There's been some stuff leaked out from the German ratings board, the USK.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.100
Of course, they had leaked out some stuff a while back

34:13.100 --> 34:18.100
including the translation of Catan and Casarone to Xbox Live Arcade.

34:18.100 --> 34:21.100
Well, now they have another board game turned Xbox Live Arcade.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.100
Did you mean Carcassonne?

34:22.100 --> 34:24.100
Carcassonne, whatever.

34:24.100 --> 34:27.100
You said it like casserole.

34:27.100 --> 34:29.100
Carcassonne.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.100
Whatever.

34:30.100 --> 34:32.100
I had to, sorry.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.100
Yeah.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.100
Okay, you finished?

34:34.100 --> 34:35.100
I'm done.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.100
I promise.

34:36.100 --> 34:41.100
Anyways, one of the games that they had on there was Ticket to Ride

34:41.100 --> 34:45.100
which, if you've played it, it's a train-themed game.

34:45.100 --> 34:46.100
Also pretty fun.

34:46.100 --> 34:51.100
Some other games that they've also were revealed on there.

34:51.100 --> 34:57.100
Of course, Penny Arcade's games on the rain, Slick Precipice of Darkness.

34:57.100 --> 35:02.100
Rugu and Golf, tee it up.

35:02.100 --> 35:06.100
And at least, we don't know when they're coming, but at least they're on their way.

35:06.100 --> 35:08.100
What are you giggling at?

35:08.100 --> 35:14.100
The Rob D in chat says, I'm going to go play that Super Mario goulash game next.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.100
Whatever.

35:15.100 --> 35:17.100
Chat room's funny.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.100
I love chat room.

35:18.100 --> 35:19.100
Chat.orangelandradio.com.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.100
Yeah, chat's just perfect.

35:21.100 --> 35:24.100
I love chat.

35:24.100 --> 35:29.100
I also love more Xbox Live Arcade games as long as they don't suck, but hey, it might

35:29.100 --> 35:30.100
be kind of cool.

35:30.100 --> 35:37.100
Fable 2 is going to be interacting with apparently three different Xbox Live Arcade games.

35:37.100 --> 35:43.100
That was recently revealed this week in an interview with the guy behind Fable 2, and

35:43.100 --> 35:47.700
money that is won in one of the games can actually be transferred to funds in Fable

35:47.700 --> 35:48.700
2.

35:48.700 --> 35:49.700
We already knew that.

35:49.700 --> 35:54.980
But Carbonated Games has made apparently some casual games, and there's three titles involved.

35:54.980 --> 36:00.040
One is called Keystone, one is called Wizard's Tower, and the other one is called Mage Dice.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.780
So when you play these games, which involve a little bit of gambling in them, you get

36:03.780 --> 36:07.660
Fable Gold in them, and you get to use that Fable Gold in your Fable game.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.740
I'm just looking forward to co-op in this game.

36:09.740 --> 36:11.660
You know you can't wait for co-op in Fable 2, Loki.

36:11.660 --> 36:16.340
Yeah, the only bad thing about Wizard's Tower is it's really just Yaris renamed Wizard's

36:16.340 --> 36:17.340
Tower.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.340
Shut up, really?

36:18.340 --> 36:19.340
No.

36:19.340 --> 36:20.340
Oh, I was going to say, that's horrible, if so.

36:20.340 --> 36:25.020
I wonder if these are going to be free, because they are kind of like, you know, marketing

36:25.020 --> 36:26.020
Fable 2.

36:26.020 --> 36:27.020
No.

36:27.020 --> 36:28.020
Hopefully they're cheap.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.020
They better not be expensive.

36:29.020 --> 36:33.300
They're going to whore this game out like a whore.

36:33.300 --> 36:38.460
Basically achievements in the game, a Fable by the way, achievement points are going to

36:38.460 --> 36:41.540
be tied to the game's morality scale.

36:41.540 --> 36:48.060
So basically achievements, you know, would be being pure, pure good and pure, pure bad

36:48.060 --> 36:49.060
could be interesting.

36:49.060 --> 36:55.300
Well duh, they're going to of course have stuff like that as well as like, I don't know,

36:55.300 --> 36:57.580
kill your dog, I don't know.

36:57.580 --> 37:02.100
But at the same time, like, the original Fable sounded so freaking awesome and then it was

37:02.100 --> 37:06.660
kind of, it was okay, it was okay.

37:06.660 --> 37:10.660
But I'm definitely interested in checking this game out, so we'll see.

37:10.660 --> 37:16.820
Well, you know, there's another game that I think is, well okay, I'd never played it,

37:16.820 --> 37:20.180
but I know a lot of people did, Puzzle Quest.

37:20.180 --> 37:25.740
Well, Puzzle Quest, you know, is doing pretty well on Xbox Live Arcade, so there's actually

37:25.740 --> 37:35.440
going to be a expansion and they're asking the players to name it for them.

37:35.440 --> 37:43.580
Sort of like a, if you actually go onto the contest website, which is at puzzle-quest.com,

37:43.580 --> 37:48.580
ooh, actually it's already over.

37:48.580 --> 37:49.580
It ended on the 21st.

37:49.580 --> 37:50.580
Dang, that went by fast.

37:50.580 --> 37:53.520
It wasn't even open when I last checked earlier this week.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.260
It ended on the 21st.

37:55.260 --> 38:00.700
Well damn, I was going to try to get our chatters to spam them with Puzzle Quest Orange or something.

38:00.700 --> 38:01.700
Not really.

38:01.700 --> 38:05.420
Well, at any rate, they said that once they've decided the name, then the expansion's going

38:05.420 --> 38:08.080
to be out in the spring over Xbox Live.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.780
So have fun.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.140
But what about all the other places they hoard Puzzle Quest to?

38:12.140 --> 38:13.500
They just get shafted, huh?

38:13.500 --> 38:14.500
I have no idea.

38:14.500 --> 38:18.660
I would have never thought Puzzle Quest was going to get an expansion or any type of microtransactions

38:18.660 --> 38:22.220
whatsoever because of the fact it was on the DS and all these other systems.

38:22.220 --> 38:25.580
So I'm kind of surprised at this news.

38:25.580 --> 38:27.580
So it's just interesting.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.820
I don't know how else to explain it.

38:29.820 --> 38:30.820
Interesting.

38:30.820 --> 38:31.820
I wasn't expecting that.

38:31.820 --> 38:32.820
Were you expecting an expansion?

38:32.820 --> 38:33.820
I sure wasn't.

38:33.820 --> 38:34.820
An expansion?

38:34.820 --> 38:37.700
No, because I thought they would just hoard that out in Puzzle Quest II or something like

38:37.700 --> 38:38.700
that.

38:38.700 --> 38:44.080
But I guess something to kill time until Puzzle Quest Galactics comes out or Galactrix

38:44.080 --> 38:47.220
or whatever the fuck they're calling it.

38:47.220 --> 38:48.220
The I-can't-believe-it's-not-puzzle-quest?

38:48.220 --> 38:49.220
Yes.

38:49.220 --> 38:50.220
Gotcha.

38:50.220 --> 38:57.180
Alright, so this weekend there's been a whole bunch of drama revolving a supposedly leaked

38:57.180 --> 39:04.060
game Sonic Unleashed with tons of screenshots out there available for it.

39:04.060 --> 39:07.060
People are wondering is this an actual game that got leaked?

39:07.060 --> 39:09.420
Is this an April Fool's joke?

39:09.420 --> 39:10.420
Who knows?

39:10.420 --> 39:14.900
Well, first it started off, eh, it's probably fake, you know, who knows?

39:14.900 --> 39:18.600
But then there's like a hundred some screenshots for this.

39:18.600 --> 39:23.580
So I don't know if it is fake, it's one of the most elaborate fakes I've ever seen.

39:23.580 --> 39:30.620
But then apparently now there was news that, you know, Sega of Europe said that it is official

39:30.620 --> 39:36.300
and that they were going to be announcing it during their May gamer's day and also make

39:36.300 --> 39:39.280
an official announcement at E3.

39:39.280 --> 39:46.100
But then there are some sort of, you know, kind of wishy-washy stuff going on with that

39:46.100 --> 39:48.780
and now it's maybe not real again.

39:48.780 --> 39:53.200
I think at this point it's safe to say with the video out there, with the screenshots

39:53.200 --> 39:56.220
out there, I would say it's real.

39:56.220 --> 39:59.860
I don't see how it can be a fake at this point based off that video because that video is

39:59.860 --> 40:02.860
pretty kick-ass which is out there on YouTube somewhere, right?

40:02.860 --> 40:05.820
You have to check out the video of this game, it looks like finally they got the right idea

40:05.820 --> 40:06.820
with Sonic.

40:06.820 --> 40:10.220
It's basically like a Sonic 2.5D as they would call it.

40:10.220 --> 40:13.980
It's very much like the traditional Sonic game, looks pretty good.

40:13.980 --> 40:19.820
The screenshots that they've been showing were supposedly from an Xbox 360 version.

40:19.820 --> 40:23.660
There's some other rumors coming out that the game is going to be on the cover of next

40:23.660 --> 40:30.380
month's Play Magazine and also that there's going to be some stuff running the official

40:30.380 --> 40:37.960
Nintendo magazine, the UK one, that's going to be, I guess, the cover in August for them.

40:37.960 --> 40:42.940
So right now we're speculating that it's coming out for the 360 and probably a version for

40:42.940 --> 40:47.220
the Wii and you can probably assume that there's a version for the PS3 if there's one coming

40:47.220 --> 40:49.340
out for the 360.

40:49.340 --> 40:52.420
ActDeft in chat says, hope for Sonic's future equals rising.

40:52.420 --> 40:58.660
I really hope so because the last few Sonic creations in a row minus his appearance in

40:58.660 --> 41:00.760
Brawl have all been very disappointing.

41:00.760 --> 41:03.580
So God, I hope so.

41:03.580 --> 41:04.580
Don't you hope, Jamie?

41:04.580 --> 41:05.980
I hope they got it right finally.

41:05.980 --> 41:06.980
I can hope.

41:06.980 --> 41:08.940
The screenshots are pretty awesome.

41:08.940 --> 41:11.300
I watched the movie file, it's pretty sweet.

41:11.300 --> 41:20.140
I think, like I said, if it was a hoax, then the hoax game needs to come out, honestly.

41:20.140 --> 41:26.780
That is one hell of an elaborate hoax to fake, I don't know how many screenshots of this

41:26.780 --> 41:27.780
game.

41:27.780 --> 41:30.100
Or even a mapped level.

41:30.100 --> 41:34.940
The video followed the level all the way through.

41:34.940 --> 41:39.020
It's very unlikely that it would be an April Fool's joke, but hey, you know what, credit

41:39.020 --> 41:44.300
to them if it is an April Fool's joke because that's one of the most convincing April Fool's

41:44.300 --> 41:46.380
jokes I've ever seen.

41:46.380 --> 41:52.140
Another convincing April Fool's joke was the rumor about Wario's Woods coming to WiiWare.

41:52.140 --> 41:56.300
Some screenshots came out earlier this week that appeared to show a version of Wario's

41:56.300 --> 41:57.300
Woods on the Wii.

41:57.300 --> 41:59.020
I'll tell you what, these are damn good screenshots.

41:59.020 --> 42:00.020
Look at that.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.100
That is pretty convincing.

42:01.100 --> 42:07.580
This whole, it has a more 3D-ish look to them and it shows the Wii remote and some little

42:07.580 --> 42:12.300
text in Japanese, I would have bought this, but guess what, it was a joke.

42:12.300 --> 42:15.740
And some of our listeners may not even know this, you may have just saw the news earlier

42:15.740 --> 42:20.360
this week, but yes, it came out Go Nintendo ran a report with a video from the guy who

42:20.360 --> 42:24.820
actually created the whole thing and he kind of shows how he did it.

42:24.820 --> 42:28.860
It was actually meant to be an April Fool's joke and apparently what happened is that

42:28.860 --> 42:33.700
he posted the joke in IRC trying to get some feedback from some of the folks in IRC like,

42:33.700 --> 42:34.700
hey, is this believable?

42:34.700 --> 42:39.060
Well, some of the folks in IRC like sent it to Joystiq and it got out there a little bit

42:39.060 --> 42:40.060
early.

42:40.060 --> 42:41.060
Whoops!

42:41.060 --> 42:43.500
So, unfortunately, it is fake.

42:43.500 --> 42:46.020
Wario's Woods not coming to WiiWare.

42:46.020 --> 42:49.580
At least this one, I mean, but then again, you never know what Nintendo might have up

42:49.580 --> 42:50.900
their sleeve.

42:50.900 --> 42:56.020
It may not look like this, but as far as I'm concerned, whatever artist did these did a

42:56.020 --> 43:00.140
pretty darn good job and Nintendo maybe ought to think to talking to this guy.

43:00.140 --> 43:02.340
Maybe they ought to cook something like this up.

43:02.340 --> 43:04.220
So we'll see.

43:04.220 --> 43:08.260
But sadly, no Wario's Woods on WiiWare anytime soon.

43:08.260 --> 43:09.860
That's poopy.

43:09.860 --> 43:13.260
Unless Nintendo's getting the last laugh, who knows?

43:13.260 --> 43:22.420
Well, something that came out in the April issue of UK's official Xbox magazine said

43:22.420 --> 43:29.460
that Ikaruga was out now and was getting a 9 out of 10 from the magazine with no actual

43:29.460 --> 43:31.020
release date.

43:31.020 --> 43:37.020
So you know what?

43:37.020 --> 43:38.020
Is this real?

43:38.020 --> 43:41.180
Oh, what, another April Fool's joke?

43:41.180 --> 43:42.420
Probably.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.420
Who knows?

43:43.420 --> 43:44.420
Ikaruga?

43:44.420 --> 43:46.140
Well, I mean, it came out in the April issue.

43:46.140 --> 43:47.980
No, I think that is.

43:47.980 --> 43:54.220
It was a piece talking about Ikaruga and usually in the corner it'll say release date, you

43:54.220 --> 43:58.860
know, March or whatever, and it says release out now because it's the April issue.

43:58.860 --> 43:59.860
So this hasn't...

43:59.860 --> 44:00.940
Well, the game is coming.

44:00.940 --> 44:02.540
We've had a story on this before, yeah.

44:02.540 --> 44:03.540
The game is coming.

44:03.540 --> 44:04.540
That's not...

44:04.540 --> 44:07.540
Just for a moment when you were talking about April Fool's Day, I was like, wait, they better

44:07.540 --> 44:08.980
not be taunting me with Ikaruga.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.620
God, I hate April Fool's Day.

44:10.620 --> 44:11.620
I know.

44:11.620 --> 44:13.580
I mean, seriously, it's going to be like this for the next two weeks.

44:13.580 --> 44:15.780
Well, they did have it out at the Tokyo Game Show.

44:15.780 --> 44:18.500
I just wasn't thinking that it was out quite yet.

44:18.500 --> 44:25.460
But Ikaruga is like one of the best shooter games ever, so that's really cool.

44:25.460 --> 44:26.460
And it's Treasure.

44:26.460 --> 44:31.460
GS68 in chat says, game publications should be banned from making April issues anymore.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.660
I kind of agree.

44:33.660 --> 44:34.660
I kind of agree.

44:34.660 --> 44:35.660
Maybe it's just me.

44:35.660 --> 44:40.720
Well, if I were a game publication, I would just flat out, you know, post a little editorial

44:40.720 --> 44:47.560
in my magazine saying, while certain other magazines and, you know, publications may

44:47.560 --> 44:52.780
want to, you know, joke about April Fool's and stuff like that, I would just say, you

44:52.780 --> 44:57.900
know, we don't do that, and we figure that you would appreciate more accurate coverage

44:57.900 --> 45:02.740
than something that may confuse you, I don't know.

45:02.740 --> 45:07.260
Which is, you know, I think the kind of stance we take on this show, you know.

45:07.260 --> 45:08.260
April Fool's is...

45:08.260 --> 45:09.260
Usually our jokes are pretty obvious.

45:09.260 --> 45:10.260
Yeah.

45:10.260 --> 45:12.780
And I don't think we're going to do one this year now in light of the other news that came

45:12.780 --> 45:14.200
out, so we'll see.

45:14.200 --> 45:22.280
The joke is we're going to stay on Live 365.

45:22.280 --> 45:24.740
So moving on with more news then, Loki.

45:24.740 --> 45:31.940
Well, we don't like to talk about him too much, but there was a brand new story this

45:31.940 --> 45:38.240
week about our friend Jackie Poo, or Voldemort, as you may know him.

45:38.240 --> 45:48.620
The Florida Supreme Court has sent an official notice to Jack Thompson that he now must have

45:48.620 --> 45:54.700
an attorney to basically approve any further cases he has.

45:54.700 --> 45:59.300
The court's ruling is basically saying that the numerous abuses that Thompson had made,

45:59.300 --> 46:03.740
including submitting pornography and stuff like that, is a relentless and frivolous pursuit

46:03.740 --> 46:09.220
for vindication of his claim that he is being victimized by the Florida Bar, and the continued

46:09.220 --> 46:14.300
ability to maintain the minimum standard of decorum and respect for the judicial system

46:14.300 --> 46:19.100
in which the litigants, and especially the attorneys, must adhere, because of this basically

46:19.100 --> 46:27.740
the motion has been made that for any lawsuit that he is now putting forward, it must be

46:27.740 --> 46:33.460
signed off by, I guess, an accredited attorney or something like that.

46:33.460 --> 46:36.220
In other words, he needs a babysitter.

46:36.220 --> 46:37.220
Yes.

46:37.220 --> 46:40.180
So it's interesting.

46:40.180 --> 46:42.060
I don't know.

46:42.060 --> 46:45.960
Hopefully we'll see a lot less of him unless he gets some other retarded person to kind

46:45.960 --> 46:52.620
of help him along and kind of join forces with him.

46:52.620 --> 46:56.460
I think it's about damn time.

46:56.460 --> 47:03.340
To Lord Voldemort from your friends at Orange Lounge Radio, you probably couldn't hear that

47:03.340 --> 47:04.340
again.

47:04.340 --> 47:05.340
Let's try this one instead.

47:05.340 --> 47:06.340
Hold on.

47:06.340 --> 47:07.340
That's wonderful.

47:07.340 --> 47:15.940
No, and here's the best part about the whole thing.

47:15.940 --> 47:23.140
After this ruling came down, apparently Thompson sent out an email describing the Supreme Court's

47:23.140 --> 47:31.940
order as both good news and idiotic, because he's got them right where he wants them now.

47:31.940 --> 47:38.700
Does he live on another planet?

47:38.700 --> 47:44.060
Speaking of crazy stuff, there's that new Street Fighter movie coming out, Street Fighter

47:44.060 --> 47:47.780
The Legend of Chun-Li, and it's getting a more full cast.

47:47.780 --> 47:49.100
Chris Klein is in it.

47:49.100 --> 47:52.260
He plays Guile's friend, which apparently is a big role.

47:52.260 --> 47:53.260
I don't know.

47:53.260 --> 47:54.260
Charlie.

47:54.260 --> 47:55.260
Right.

47:55.260 --> 47:56.260
Charlie Nash.

47:56.260 --> 48:06.580
Kristen Kreuk, who is the Lois Lane on Smallville.

48:06.580 --> 48:07.580
She's playing...

48:07.580 --> 48:10.020
No, I guess it would be Lana Lane, because it was a daughter, right?

48:10.020 --> 48:11.020
I don't know.

48:11.020 --> 48:12.020
I don't watch Smallville.

48:12.020 --> 48:13.020
That's her.

48:13.020 --> 48:14.020
Whatever.

48:14.020 --> 48:15.020
She's going to be Chun-Li.

48:15.020 --> 48:16.940
I bet half the guys who watch her don't even know what her name is.

48:16.940 --> 48:18.000
They just watch her.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.460
She's going to be Chun-Li, and Michael Clarke Duncan is going to be Balrog.

48:22.460 --> 48:23.460
Get this.

48:23.460 --> 48:27.460
Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas is going to be Vega.

48:27.460 --> 48:29.540
He's the guy with the long hair and the black eyed peas.

48:29.540 --> 48:30.900
He's going to be Vega.

48:30.900 --> 48:32.780
That's going to be interesting.

48:32.780 --> 48:36.460
Neil McDonough is going to be M. Bison.

48:36.460 --> 48:41.100
And I've never really heard that name, but then when I see his picture, I'm like, okay,

48:41.100 --> 48:42.100
that guy.

48:42.100 --> 48:45.040
I think I've seen him before, somewhere.

48:45.040 --> 48:49.580
And I agree with SSJ100Matt in chat who says, this movie fails for one reason.

48:49.580 --> 48:50.580
No Kylie.

48:50.580 --> 48:52.060
And I kind of agree.

48:52.060 --> 48:55.980
Oh, this guy was in Star Trek First Contact.

48:55.980 --> 48:56.980
That's why he looks familiar.

48:56.980 --> 48:58.340
Minority Report.

48:58.340 --> 48:59.340
Band of Brothers.

48:59.340 --> 49:00.340
Okay.

49:00.340 --> 49:01.340
He's been hand fulfilled.

49:01.340 --> 49:03.300
You know why this movie also fails?

49:03.300 --> 49:04.300
Uh oh.

49:04.300 --> 49:05.300
Why?

49:05.300 --> 49:09.780
Because it's a Street Fighter movie and anybody that thinks of Street Fighter the movie is

49:09.780 --> 49:14.580
always going to think of the last horrible Street Fighter movie.

49:14.580 --> 49:17.220
Okay, I just killed...

49:17.220 --> 49:18.220
I just...

49:18.220 --> 49:19.220
Horrell Julia.

49:19.220 --> 49:23.900
I just realized why this guy looks so familiar to me, but I almost don't want to say why.

49:23.900 --> 49:32.160
And it's because of one of the movies he was recently in was the last movie I saw on DVD.

49:32.160 --> 49:34.660
It was I Know Who Killed Me.

49:34.660 --> 49:38.300
I actually watched that on DVD and he was in it.

49:38.300 --> 49:39.300
Because I have to see...

49:39.300 --> 49:44.560
Okay, when a film wins the award for worst movie of the year, I have to see just how

49:44.560 --> 49:45.860
bad it is.

49:45.860 --> 49:46.860
And it was pretty bad.

49:46.860 --> 49:47.860
No you don't.

49:47.860 --> 49:50.660
I'm going to give you fair warning that it sucks.

49:50.660 --> 49:51.660
So why do you...

49:51.660 --> 49:52.660
I like that movie.

49:52.660 --> 49:53.660
I love Showgirls.

49:53.660 --> 49:56.080
Showgirls is one of my favorite movies of all time, but it's one of those things where

49:56.080 --> 49:57.900
it's so bad it's good.

49:57.900 --> 49:58.900
Get it?

49:58.900 --> 50:02.980
Like, we actually had a discussion about this at our friend's house the other day.

50:02.980 --> 50:06.460
And the movie actually came up as Caveman.

50:06.460 --> 50:07.460
Have you seen that movie?

50:07.460 --> 50:08.460
No.

50:08.460 --> 50:12.380
It was really, really not a good movie and it was one of the 70s and the dinosaurs in

50:12.380 --> 50:13.380
it were all claymation.

50:13.380 --> 50:14.380
Nice.

50:14.380 --> 50:18.060
But it was so awful that it's a great movie.

50:18.060 --> 50:19.860
Nice.

50:19.860 --> 50:21.660
I've seen Teenage Caveman.

50:21.660 --> 50:25.260
That was like Mystery Science Theater 3000.

50:25.260 --> 50:27.180
Manos, The Hands of Fate.

50:27.180 --> 50:31.140
Alright, can we please move on?

50:31.140 --> 50:32.780
Yeah.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.260
I have some stuff.

50:35.260 --> 50:43.280
So I don't know how I feel about this because, you know, again with all of the movies coming

50:43.280 --> 50:51.620
out from, you know, video games, and especially since the horrible, horrible Ooey bowl is

50:51.620 --> 51:00.540
associated with this one, The Name of the King, A Dungeon Siege Tale is going to be

51:00.540 --> 51:02.340
out on April 15th.

51:02.340 --> 51:05.580
You know, I knew this like a long time ago and I wish I had thought about this, but I

51:05.580 --> 51:09.260
figured it was an Ooey bowl movie and no one really cares.

51:09.260 --> 51:17.060
It will have deleted scenes, behind the scenes featurette, and trailers.

51:17.060 --> 51:26.180
And the suggested retail is $27.98, so look for it in the $5 bin at Walmart in a few weeks

51:26.180 --> 51:27.180
after that.

51:27.180 --> 51:32.220
Has anyone, I don't know if anyone else saw the news this week.

51:32.220 --> 51:39.460
They're running a website for Postal, the movie, because it's launching the same weekend

51:39.460 --> 51:49.660
as Indiana Jones, and they have Vern Troyer dressed up like Indy and it was like, I don't

51:49.660 --> 51:55.980
remember what the phrase was, it was something stupid like, you know, I have a message for

51:55.980 --> 52:00.720
Indy fuck you, or like fuck you up or something like that, I don't know.

52:00.720 --> 52:06.300
But they literally, I think, I'm sure it's supposed to be parody, but half of me still

52:06.300 --> 52:10.180
thinks that they literally think that they're going to beat Indiana Jones in the box office

52:10.180 --> 52:11.180
somehow.

52:11.180 --> 52:12.180
Delusional.

52:12.180 --> 52:13.180
Exactly.

52:13.180 --> 52:20.180
You know what's going to happen when they go back to work Monday morning after that

52:20.180 --> 52:22.940
weekend?

52:22.940 --> 52:26.900
Vern Troyer is going to go drink some more.

52:26.900 --> 52:33.620
No, he's about as delusional as Jack Thompson.

52:33.620 --> 52:37.500
It's basically just going to be, you know, he's going to think it's a great victory for

52:37.500 --> 52:42.180
him and that, you know, it may make him the most money out of any of his movies or some

52:42.180 --> 52:47.300
shit like that, and he'll have renewed hope for making more video game movies or something.

52:47.300 --> 52:48.300
I don't know.

52:48.300 --> 52:49.740
I kind of miss when this show had a soundboard.

52:49.740 --> 52:54.580
I think in our post-live 365 era, we need to bring back the soundboard.

52:54.580 --> 52:56.580
I kind of miss having one.

52:56.580 --> 52:57.580
Yeah.

52:57.580 --> 52:58.580
Okay.

52:58.580 --> 52:59.580
Sorry.

52:59.580 --> 53:07.280
So, Call of Duty 4, a very successful game, they are going to be getting a brand new Game

53:07.280 --> 53:14.100
of the Year edition, which is going to be coming out in April, actually April 3rd for

53:14.100 --> 53:16.780
the Xbox 360 version.

53:16.780 --> 53:21.740
Along with that, there will be a brand new map pack that's going to have a few different

53:21.740 --> 53:28.820
maps of Creek, Broadcast, Chinatown, and Kill House, that's going to be available for $10,

53:28.820 --> 53:32.980
and as you might guess, in the Game of the Year edition, you get a token to download

53:32.980 --> 53:37.020
that for free, so if you haven't bought the game yet and are thinking about it, you may

53:37.020 --> 53:38.940
wait for this one to come out.

53:38.940 --> 53:45.100
It should be noted, though, that for some reason whatsoever, the PlayStation 3 version's

53:45.100 --> 53:49.180
coming out a few weeks after the Xbox 360 one.

53:49.180 --> 53:56.180
I don't get that, but that's going on, so hooray.

53:56.180 --> 53:58.100
Hooray?

53:58.100 --> 54:01.580
I guess.

54:01.580 --> 54:06.420
Also hooray for this, I like the store Target, and Target is apparently getting into gaming

54:06.420 --> 54:08.180
in a way you may not have guessed.

54:08.180 --> 54:11.620
They are selling indie gaming shirts.

54:11.620 --> 54:17.060
They're selling shirts from independent games like Tower of Goo and some other games that

54:17.060 --> 54:20.820
are there, and the shirts only cost you $12, here's the best part, buy the shirt, get the

54:20.820 --> 54:22.020
game with it.

54:22.020 --> 54:24.460
They actually have the game, like I can see in this little picture, the game's actually

54:24.460 --> 54:29.240
kind of hanging around the collar of the shirt, so you can get both for $12.

54:29.240 --> 54:30.240
That's cool.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.240
That's kind of a neat little concept.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.240
That is really cool.

54:32.240 --> 54:34.980
That is strange to see at Target, though, of all places.

54:34.980 --> 54:38.260
I would not have expected this to be at Target.

54:38.260 --> 54:40.580
EGP Apparel.

54:40.580 --> 54:43.460
I would expect to see that maybe at GameStop or something.

54:43.460 --> 54:49.260
Yeah, or some other type of nerd store like Hot Topic, it's kind of nerdy, right?

54:49.260 --> 54:53.140
EGPapparel.com if you want to see more about that.

54:53.140 --> 54:54.900
Buy the shirt and get the game for free.

54:54.900 --> 54:55.900
That's cool.

54:55.900 --> 54:57.260
That's very interesting.

54:57.260 --> 54:58.540
Tower of Goo sounds funny.

54:58.540 --> 55:01.180
MacMan in chat says Target and Kmart.

55:01.180 --> 55:04.840
Tower of Goo is coming to the WiiWare also.

55:04.840 --> 55:05.840
You know what I didn't realize?

55:05.840 --> 55:11.460
I did not realize until just last week that Defend Your Castle game that's coming to the

55:11.460 --> 55:12.460
Wii.

55:12.460 --> 55:15.460
I did not realize that it's based off the old Flash game where you throw the guys up

55:15.460 --> 55:20.460
in the air and watch them explode into millions of pieces, because I saw the preview for that

55:20.460 --> 55:25.860
somewhere earlier this week, and when I watched it, I'm like, oh, shit, that game.

55:25.860 --> 55:29.100
That would be hella fun in multiplayer mode.

55:29.100 --> 55:30.100
That Defend Your Castle game.

55:30.100 --> 55:32.340
Especially when you're drunk and you're just like, ah.

55:32.340 --> 55:33.340
That game is fun.

55:33.340 --> 55:36.100
What's the site that you can play that game for free on?

55:36.100 --> 55:41.060
I don't know, but they had it linked, I know, on the Joystick story for that when they were

55:41.060 --> 55:42.860
talking about.

55:42.860 --> 55:45.620
But I'm sure if you type in Defend Your Castle, you probably can find it.

55:45.620 --> 55:50.180
XGenStudios.com slash play slash castle.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.780
That game is so much fun, even though it's like years old.

55:52.780 --> 55:54.700
I think it's been on the internet for like three years.

55:54.700 --> 55:59.260
Let me post that in chat there so our lovely chatters can take a look at that game.

55:59.260 --> 56:02.260
But don't get too distracted, because it's time for us to open up the Skype line.

56:02.260 --> 56:03.260
That's right.

56:03.260 --> 56:05.920
It's the part of the show where we let you guys interact with us if you want to give

56:05.920 --> 56:09.100
us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

56:09.100 --> 56:11.740
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

56:11.740 --> 56:15.300
This is the part of the show where you can do that and interact with us, and we'll be

56:15.300 --> 56:21.780
taking calls I'd say right about right now, at least when they start coming in.

56:21.780 --> 56:26.740
So in the meantime, we ought to go to Loki for some last-minute stories, yes, Loki?

56:26.740 --> 56:27.740
Yes.

56:27.740 --> 56:31.800
Okay, so to start things off, let's see.

56:31.800 --> 56:36.320
We've got some kind of terrible news, actually.

56:36.320 --> 56:40.500
There's rumors that the latest Wii update blocks the freeloader from working.

56:40.500 --> 56:41.500
Yes, that's right.

56:41.500 --> 56:48.920
The brand new freeloader that apparently was supposed to be unfazed by Wii updates, apparently

56:48.920 --> 56:50.460
that's been broken.

56:50.460 --> 56:55.380
Although we're getting mixed, or I should say Go Nintendo has been getting mixed emails

56:55.380 --> 56:56.380
about it.

56:56.380 --> 56:58.260
Some people are saying that it is not working.

56:58.260 --> 57:01.060
Some people are saying it is still working.

57:01.060 --> 57:07.620
But the real update that was supposed to be for that is it's actually supposed to be defeating

57:07.620 --> 57:11.180
a different homebrew kind of hack thing that they had going on.

57:11.180 --> 57:14.700
I told you it would take like 15 seconds for Nintendo to patch that show.

57:14.700 --> 57:19.140
No, it's not the one you're thinking, too, it's this thing called a Trecha Assigner.

57:19.140 --> 57:24.460
It basically allows them to create, because all the files on Wii discs are encrypted,

57:24.460 --> 57:28.900
so this will allow you to create the key and basically put your own files, make your own

57:28.900 --> 57:31.260
homebrew discs for the Wii, basically.

57:31.260 --> 57:32.260
Let's go to the phones.

57:32.260 --> 57:33.260
I've got somebody on hold.

57:33.260 --> 57:34.260
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

57:34.260 --> 57:35.260
Who's this?

57:35.260 --> 57:36.260
Yeah, what's up?

57:36.260 --> 57:37.260
This is RossDioUT.

57:37.260 --> 57:38.260
Hello.

57:38.260 --> 57:39.260
Wow.

57:39.260 --> 57:40.260
You're really good at getting through first.

57:40.260 --> 57:41.260
You're like the new Raven's Dolphin.

57:41.260 --> 57:42.660
Whatever happened to Raven's Dolphin?

57:42.660 --> 57:46.700
Did he abandon our show?

57:46.700 --> 57:49.140
Raven's Dolphin, where are you?

57:49.140 --> 57:50.140
I miss you.

57:50.140 --> 57:51.140
Okay, I'm sorry.

57:51.140 --> 57:52.140
RossDioUT, you're cool, too.

57:52.140 --> 57:53.140
What's up?

57:53.140 --> 57:54.140
Okay.

57:54.140 --> 57:59.180
First off, I'm surprised you didn't mention this early on in the show when you were talking

57:59.180 --> 58:07.140
about the Gibson lawsuit bonanza, but here's a link that talks about the patent.

58:07.140 --> 58:11.660
I'm going to put it in the chat right now.

58:11.660 --> 58:20.180
Basically what's happening is that the diagram that goes with the patent shows a stereoscopic

58:20.180 --> 58:30.580
headset, an eight-channel mixer, a FEX processor, among other crazy-ass shit, and an actual

58:30.580 --> 58:31.580
musical instrument.

58:31.580 --> 58:35.060
I don't know if you can see the picture from that link.

58:35.060 --> 58:36.940
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

58:36.940 --> 58:41.380
Yeah, I didn't want to spend too much time on that whole Gibson lawsuit because I think

58:41.380 --> 58:42.380
it's retarded.

58:42.380 --> 58:44.180
I was going to get to that actually in a few seconds.

58:44.180 --> 58:45.620
What do you want to say then, Libby?

58:45.620 --> 58:48.940
Well, basically here's what Harmonix's response to the Gibson lawsuit was.

58:48.940 --> 58:54.780
This lawsuit is completely without merit and we intend to defend it vigorously.

58:54.780 --> 58:59.300
Gibson's patent filed nearly 10 years ago required a 3D display, a real musical instrument,

58:59.300 --> 59:01.780
and a recording of a concert.

59:01.780 --> 59:04.460
Rock band and guitar hero are completely different.

59:04.460 --> 59:09.400
Among other things, they are games, require no headset, and use a controller only shaped

59:09.400 --> 59:10.400
like a real instrument.

59:10.400 --> 59:14.900
It's unfortunate Gibson unfairly desires to share the tremendous success enjoyed by the

59:14.900 --> 59:17.260
developers of rock band and guitar hero.

59:17.260 --> 59:20.820
Yeah, looking at this little picture of the guitar, I mean, I know pictures and patents

59:20.820 --> 59:25.100
aren't supposed to be the end all be all because we've seen others throughout the years, but

59:25.100 --> 59:27.820
this looks nothing like the game controller that they're using.

59:27.820 --> 59:29.820
It looks like a MIDI guitar.

59:29.820 --> 59:38.340
Yeah, I mean, it looks so far removed from guitar hero and rock band, I don't even see

59:38.340 --> 59:39.860
where Gibson's coming from.

59:39.860 --> 59:47.220
They're not going to win this, that's for sure, because it's not even close.

59:47.220 --> 59:51.860
Not even, not even, and I'm shocked seeing it that they'd even bother.

59:51.860 --> 59:54.700
But then again, we've seen more stupid lawsuits before.

59:54.700 --> 59:59.700
Oh yes, there was one other thing.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:05.660
Rainbow Six Vegas 2 came out last week, and if anybody's listening is thinking about getting

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:09.820
it, I would stay away from the PS3 one if you're interested in online, because the online

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:10.820
is broken.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:15.220
Oh great, what's broken about it?

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:25.460
Well, I'm finding myself unable to get into most games, and the few games that I can get

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:29.260
into, I get booted off right away, and it's not just me.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:33.140
In those few games, I've talked to the people there and they're having the same problem.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:37.020
I know it's not me because I'm not having the problem with Vegas 1, I'm not having a

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:42.360
problem with a lot of the other PS3 games, Call of Duty 4 and stuff, but I was actually

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:49.820
rather shocked, especially since the game had a release day patch.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.420
Don't worry, a patch will fix it.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:58.300
That seems to be the thinking of video games in this day and age.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:02.980
The patch that came out when the game came out, I'm serious, I pre-ordered the game,

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.520
I got it first day, right?

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:11.580
And I go home, literally, immediately, PlayStation Network's like, yeah, we got a patch, download

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.380
it, and I was like, alright.

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.940
I figured it was a multiplayer patch, but apparently not.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.140
Patches should be for what Rock Band just did.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.780
It added a whole new feature to the thing that maybe should have been there in the first

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.780
place, but oh well, it was a new feature, something new and neat.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.820
That is an acceptable patch to me.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:34.640
An unacceptable patch to me is, oh, I don't know, Bully?

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.020
Or countless others?

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.740
Yeah, that's another one.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:44.860
Another thing is, this isn't the first time we've seen an Ubisoft game with a patch to

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.900
fix things that were either broken or they were too lazy to get in.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:53.260
I don't know if you guys remember Naruto, Rise of a Ninja?

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.580
Like a week after the game came out, they came out with a Japanese language patch.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:00.280
It is literally 52 megs.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.220
They're basically unlocking it off the disk.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.220
It's just ridiculous.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.900
I don't know, 52 megs doesn't sound like a key.

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.180
Usually a key is pretty small.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.980
52 megs, that sounds like actual dialogue to me.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.340
There's no possible way.

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:20.780
It's all the voices in the town and the cutscenes.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.260
There's a lot more than 52 megs worth of dialogue going on there.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.260
It's all voices.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:31.660
I don't know how that could be all the dialogue.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:36.660
It's just too much.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:41.240
We don't see it as much as we did when the 360 came out.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.500
I think companies are getting better about it.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:52.900
But we're still seeing this sort of, ah, fuck it, rush it out, we'll patch it attitude.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:59.380
It's going to start hurting companies, especially with these consoles getting more popular because

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.820
you know the majority of them aren't going to be online.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:07.900
It's just a numbers game.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.380
I really feel sorry for the people who are going to get stuck with unpatched versions,

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:15.500
especially with what Rob mentioned, Bully.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.500
That's going to suck.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.980
Well, Ross, we've got to wrap up so you can go, but any other quick thoughts you want

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.980
to get out there?

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:26.300
Actually, no.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:33.820
I mean, that's pretty much it, except for the whole Ubisoft buying Tom Clancy thing.

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:38.620
The only thing I was surprised was that they hadn't already done it.

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:42.620
I would have thought that was already a relationship that was, but there you have it.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:45.380
All right, Ross, have a good one, buddy.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.380
You too, Sam.

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.380
Bye bye.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:51.260
All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:55.140
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:00.420
Any other stories you want to share with us, Loki, while we're waiting?

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.420
Sure.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.980
There's apparently some pretty cool mods.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:03.980
Oh, never mind.

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:04.980
We've got to call.

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:05.980
Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:06.980
Who's this?

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:07.980
Hey, what's up?

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.980
It's the RobD guys.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:09.980
Well, hello.

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:10.980
Long time, no talk.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.980
RobD.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:12.980
Hi.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:13.980
How are you?

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:14.980
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.180
I've kind of been working and all that fun stuff.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.780
I work most Sundays and I close, so that kind of disables me from actually listening to

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.780
you guys.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.780
Work?

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.420
What is this work thing you speak of?

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.820
Yeah, I know.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.860
I need to actually abandon my job and only play games for a living.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.860
Exactly.

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.860
See how that one goes for a little while.

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:35.860
Exactly.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.860
All right.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:37.860
Well, what's on your mind tonight, Rob?

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:43.300
Well, I've got to say, actually, just listening to Ross steal UTT's call, now that Ubisoft

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:48.020
actually owns a Tom Clancy license, we're going to see Tom Clancy's, I don't know,

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:53.260
Tom Clancy's Nautilus or Rise of a Ninja or Tom Clancy's Enchanted Arms now that they

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:54.700
actually own the property.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:05:00.860
I somehow doubt that would happen, but usually, that's kind of like the same thing with

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:05.600
the whole, when Activision bought Blizzard or whatever, the whole World of Warcraft will

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.500
come to Guitar Hero tomorrow.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:15.460
That'd be great, but I got to say, the reason I called in is I don't really have a topic

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:19.740
to discuss, but I need to just express my joy as a fighting game fan of just the titles

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:23.340
coming out this year, because you've got King of Fighters XII, you've got Super Smash

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:28.080
Brothers Brawl, Street Fighter IV, Super Street Fighter II HD Remix, Soul Calibur IV.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.540
I can't remember a crop of fighting games, well, at least-

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:31.540
Tekken 6?

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:35.780
At the very least, with this pedigree, yeah, exactly, with this pedigree for a very long

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:36.780
time.

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.220
We'll see if all these games end up panning out to be good.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.500
That obviously remains to be seen, but as a fighting game fan, I just haven't been

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:48.100
this excited for games, especially to see some of these franchises go multiplayer, well,

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.420
with online multiplayer for the very first time.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:55.220
Hopefully we'll see that out of several franchises this year, especially good multiplayer out

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:56.220
of Street Fighter.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.220
That'd be-

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.220
That's a good point.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.500
I can't think of a year that has been quite as big for fighting games as this year is

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.500
shaping up to be.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.220
I haven't really had it put in perspective for me like that, but yeah, that's a lot

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.380
of big-ass franchises all coming back.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:11.180
I think the only big franchise I can think of that's missing is Mortal Kombat, and

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:16.620
most would say that franchise peaked quite some time ago, so whatever, but that's

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:17.620
kind of interesting.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.860
I still gave some screenshots for the other day for King of Fighters XII, and it looks

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.900
pretty hot, I got to say.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.900
Not that I've been-

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.260
Yeah, they read you all the animations for all that, so I'm looking forward to seeing

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.820
how they'll actually turn out.

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:34.980
Trucker Terry's back, so for all the Terry Bogard, Engrish, hey, come on, come on, fans,

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.940
that should make many of them pleased.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.940
Nice.

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.880
Speaking of old school fighting games from SNK, you know how your pick, your classic

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.820
game of the week last week was The Last Blade.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.700
They have it on GameTap 1 and 2, so I went and played it for a little bit, just because

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.300
I had never really played it before.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:54.260
It's fun, although I was using a keyboard, and fighting games with keyboards are always

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.260
kind of wonky.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.060
You've got to really use a joystick, but eh, I had fun while I was playing.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.620
I think it's a really stylish game.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.340
Yeah, it's definitely stylish.

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:03.820
I couldn't figure out any of the fatalities, though.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.180
That was the part I was looking forward to doing, but anyway, sorry, I didn't mean

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.540
to derail, but what do you think about the whole Street Fighter IV?

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:15.820
Do you think it's shaping up to be pretty awesome, or is it just like Street Fighter

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.700
II ten years later, or what do you think?

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.580
Well it's nice to see that they're actually modernizing the look, and I think this is

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:27.580
an important step for the franchise, that they're moving finally from sprites to, you

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.140
know, some modern graphics that aren't done by, what was that company that did Street

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.260
Fighter EX?

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:35.060
I think Akira or something like that?

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.060
I don't even remember, frankly.

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:43.060
To me, it all depends on how the game plays, you can't really determine until the game

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.060
actually comes out.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:48.020
I think it's going to be disappointing if the game doesn't really come out with anything

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:52.140
particularly new in the fighting game engine, especially since SNK has been changing up

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:56.620
their fighting game engine practically every year, and with King of Fighters XI, they really

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:00.580
broke out, pulled out all the stops with the super cancels, well not the super cancels,

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:06.340
because that's been there for a while, but the dream cancels, the saving shifts, a lot

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:12.980
of things that actually changed the gameplay, and just really helped it out as a franchise.

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:16.860
I'd really like to see how the game plays, and considering I really doubt that it'll

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:19.980
actually make any kind of a splash in American arcades, we'll probably have to wait until

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:23.140
it comes out whenever it does.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:28.940
Do you think American arcades can be saved, Rob?

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:35.100
Probably not, not with how online play has been just proliferated over here, and in Japan

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:40.300
I don't think that's really as much of a concern, since they're not really into shooters

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:45.340
as much as we are certainly, and they haven't had Xbox Live, or at least they don't support

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:51.380
Xbox Live as much as we do, I really doubt you can get gamers that gathered again.

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:56.180
So sad, because it was just not even, you can count how long ago it was when arcades

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:01.020
were still, they might have been getting closer on its last legs, but this show started due

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:05.860
to hanging out in an arcade, so this is kind of sad.

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:10.300
I have fond memories of playing Neo Geo games and playing the old X in an arcade game, Turtles

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.260
in Time especially was a favorite of mine, oh god.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.700
You can still play Neo Geo arcade, like they have a Neo Geo arcade machine at Jim Boy's

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.700
Tacos, have you seen that?

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:19.700
I don't eat at Jim Boy's.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:24.580
Oh, but well, okay, well, they have one there, it might be worth looking at.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.220
There's a bajillion Jim Boys around too, I don't know which one you mean.

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:33.380
It's the one over on Folsom and Sunrise, I know that makes no sense to our other listeners,

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.380
but anyway.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:40.940
Well, I used to go to Rico's Pizza, and play the DDR there while I was eating pizza, and

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.140
18 Wheeler Pro Trekker.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.740
Yeah, remember when pizza parlors had hella arcade games in them, like it was like pizza

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:52.620
slash arcade, and now you're lucky to go to a round table and see like two games and a

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.980
pinball table, that's it.

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:54.980
You're lucky to see that.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:58.220
Well, we were just talking about, just for the pinball aspect, we were talking, because

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:02.380
I'm sure everyone by now knows that, you know, my husband and I collect pinball machines,

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:07.580
no tables, but we were just talking about how you used to be able to go anywhere and

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:13.080
there would always be a pinball, and some sort of classic game, and whatever was not

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:19.140
exactly new new, but was new about three months ago, they're waiting, you know.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:24.100
And now it's like, no, we have crane games, sorry.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.100
That's sad.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:30.100
Yeah, the pizza parlor was where I first played Street Fighter II, so, and I actually, the

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:34.580
first character I ever played as was Dalsim, or as my mom called him, Mr. Stretchy Arms,

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:40.300
so I've always kind of had a soft spot in my heart for pizza parlor arcade games.

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:43.580
My first Street Fighter II was at a 7-11.

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:47.620
My first Street Fighter II was at a college arcade.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:52.060
My college arcade, I can still remember the lineup for the longest time.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:58.940
We had Cyber, not, what am I thinking of, I can't remember, Cyberstorm was it?

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:06.420
It was like, it was sort of like a virtual on ripoff, sort of, and we had A Killer Instinct,

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:12.740
we had World Cup Soccer 94, which became my favorite table and I own one now, we had Dark

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:20.540
Stalkers, we had KOF 94, and a bunch of other machines that I usually ignored.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:26.340
SSJ100Matt says, yeah, I remember when 7-11s had arcade games here, and I was gonna say,

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.020
it wasn't a 7-11, but the same type of thing, a little convenience store chain was one of

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.140
the first places I played Mortal Kombat II.

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:39.220
Well, 7-11 actually went out of business in Alabama a long time ago, I was really surprised

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:43.420
when it moved out here and saw 7-11s, but I would go to any one of them and there would

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.660
always be some sort of game, whether it worked or not was another story, but there would

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.380
be a game there, so it was weird.

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:52.740
Now you can find good arcade machines though at truck stops.

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.700
I found Derby Owners Club at a truck stop.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:55.700
Good times.

01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:59.380
Alright, well, Rob D., we've been on the phone a while now, so I gotta ask you so we can

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:02.780
get some more calls, any last thoughts, any other things you wanna say?

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.780
Uh...

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.780
Pawa Dunk!

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.780
I'll just send it there.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.780
Alright, have a good one, Rob.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.780
See you guys later.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:09.780
Bye.

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.780
Bye.

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:13.620
I guess he was getting some bad echo on the line, I don't know how that happened, happened,

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.620
happened, happened, no just kidding.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:21.180
Alright, you can give us a call if you want, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:24.300
Loki, what was that story you were gonna read for us earlier?

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:29.580
Uh, well apparently there's some really cool mods, character mods you can have for the

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:34.020
PlayStation 3 version, or actually the PC version also of Unreal Tournament 3, including

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:35.660
Master Chief.

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:38.740
They also have the guy from Crysis.

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:45.500
There's also, of course, Marcus Fenix, and Cloud, and Spawn.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:52.580
And actually the one for Halo, I gotta say, looks better than the Xbox 360 version.

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.580
Let's go to the phones.

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:54.580
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:55.580
Who's this?

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.580
Oh, sweet Jesus.

01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.580
I finally got in.

01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:58.580
It's DJ Dark Knight.

01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.580
Hi, DJ Dark Knight.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.580
What's on your mind?

01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:01.580
Uh, not much.

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:06.180
I was surprised you guys didn't talk about Guitar Hero DS.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.180
We did.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.740
You might have arrived late to the show, it was early in Part A.

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:16.660
Well, I remember I saw Peripheral about it, and all I could think of is, ugh, major cramps

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:19.060
for that game, I swear.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.060
I don't think so.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.060
I don't know.

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:26.800
Cause it's gonna be just like you're holding the guitar usually, but I think it'd be very

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.860
comfortable actually, cause the keys are sideways.

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:34.420
It's not like on top, that would cramp your hands, but your hand actually slides through

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:38.860
like a little velcro holder thing, and it still looks like a carpal tunnel nightmare

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:39.860
to me.

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:40.860
I don't know.

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:41.860
Yeah.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:44.460
Yeah, I mean, it'll probably, like I said, it'll probably work out, but it doesn't mean,

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:48.500
I know in my case, the way my hands are, I know it's not gonna work too well for me.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:52.980
Um, I was thinking about something else that totally slipped my mind, cause that was the

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:54.980
main thing I wanted to talk about.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.740
Um, something about the live 365 thing, that does suck.

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.700
That does suck major balls, I know.

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.300
It sucks and it's nice, like, you know, I'm hearing from people who are offering to

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:09.140
help pay for the increased fees and all that, which I think is really nice, but at the same

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.580
time you have to, I just want everybody to understand part of the reason that we're leaving

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:18.420
is because we disagree with the rate increase of such significance, and the fact that maybe

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:22.580
it's just time for the station to have a kick in the butt and, uh, you know, try something

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:23.580
a little different.

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:27.380
You know, we've been doing it the same way for five and a half years, so we're just trying

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:30.980
to see the positives and what is kind of otherwise a depressing thing, and I know it's really

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:35.300
going to suck because it displaces, um, our weeknight shows, at least for right now.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:40.460
I mean, we're hoping we can take them with us wherever we end up, but, uh, you know,

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:44.740
it's going to be some growing pains, but I'm hoping in the long run it actually ends up

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:45.740
as a good thing.

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:51.220
Well, I gotta say, if you ever need a spot for Shoutcast, we got lines open.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.660
I appreciate it, you know, and I know a lot of people are saying Shoutcast and it's definitely

01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:00.380
a possibility, uh, we have ideas and we'll see what happens.

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:03.860
The other thing about Shoutcast, too, is you got to pay for music licensing if we were

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.940
going to do something like that, so.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:09.700
But then, you know, all the video game music, I mean, we just, I mean, I think no matter

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:13.500
what happens, unfortunately, we're going to have to get rid of our licensed music in,

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:19.020
in terms of the cage match that we do every week and the, uh, you know, any shows we had

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:23.540
where we were playing a lot of licensed music, like unfortunately Jamie's old show, uh, Matt's

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.060
mix show, you know, things like that.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.060
Hell, my show when I play that.

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:28.620
Oh darn, we'll have to get rid of that show that we got rid of, like, a year ago.

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.860
Well, you know what I mean, but you talked about bringing it back, too, and, you know,

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:35.220
it's just, uh, not gonna, it can't happen now, so.

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.220
We'll see what happens.

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.220
We don't know.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:40.540
We can always resurrect that My Name Is God-O mix.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.180
But I don't know, when it comes to video game music, it feels differently to me.

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.380
I don't think, you know, it seems like a different realm.

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:48.100
I, I would, I would go underground with video game music.

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.100
I think we'd be okay.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.100
Yeah.

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.820
Yeah, um, like I said, good luck on that one.

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:53.820
Um.

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:54.820
Thank you.

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.780
Like I said, other than that, though, um, of course, me being the fancy star of Universe

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:01.420
Fanatic, uh, finally back on the game and whatnot, it's officially White Day in the

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.420
game and whatnot.

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:07.260
I keep meaning to sign on and just kind of, like, play around in Fantasy Star Universe

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:12.740
and see if I, I don't know, like it again, um, but I keep, just keep getting sidetracked,

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.140
stupid wow and stuff like that.

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:17.740
Well, like Gary said, you can't really enjoy it unless you get the expansion, of course.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:22.220
Once you get the expansion, then yeah, you can do, enjoy the newer stuff, but I mean,

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:26.500
if you still just have the basic ones, you're still not gonna, you won't get, you won't

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.220
be able to get all the new, be able to do all the new stuff and whatnot.

01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.220
Is these, expansion is what, 20 bucks?

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.220
15 bucks?

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.220
20 bucks?

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:34.220
Um, I don't know.

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.220
I don't look into it.

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.220
I really don't know.

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:38.220
I know on live, you can, on live, you can download it.

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:39.220
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.220
On live, you can download it.

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.220
Because I have to uninstall it.

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.220
40 bucks?

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.220
Geez.

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.220
I don't know about that.

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.220
Yeah, that's a bit much.

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:52.180
But yeah, I mean, I, like I said, I still play that, I still play that game because

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:56.180
it gives, it keeps me from playing, it's the only game I play on my PlayStation 2 now.

01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:57.180
That's the sad part.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.980
I don't play anything else on it.

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:00.980
But anyway.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:03.780
Uh, anything else you want to share, Dark Knight, with our listeners?

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.820
Uh, no one else about it, but um, permission to plug?

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:10.020
Oh, hell, why not?

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.020
Because we like ya.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:17.560
Okay, um, I kind of blend my voice to two shows on radio station called Disagenius Radio.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.540
One is my show called DJ Dark Knight's Ninja Dojo, and the number one is called, um, Anime

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:28.220
Damashi on there, which is hosted by, um, the Rob D, me, Foodie Monster, and I guess

01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:33.380
the others, which is basically anime show, all, um, anime podcast shows.

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:36.940
Tune in if you like, we on, we got podcasts out and everything, so.

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:37.940
Nice.

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:38.940
Alright, that's it.

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.740
Have a good night, enjoy your Easter, talk to y'all later.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.740
Alright, have a good one.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:44.740
Bye.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.740
Bye.

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:46.740
What do you think?

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:47.740
One more call?

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:48.740
We'll do one more call.

01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:49.740
Sure.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:50.740
Uno mas.

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:57.460
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:01.020
If we are going to be doing a break from live broadcasting for a little while and going

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:06.880
to tape, we will be sure to, uh, have more time for calls next week as we, uh, say goodbye

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.220
to Live Thesis 5, because believe it or not, next week is going to be our last show on

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.820
Live Thesis 5 no matter what.

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.820
It's kind of odd.

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.140
Kind of scary in a way.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.140
Eh.

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:18.140
Eh.

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.140
That's, uh, Loki's attitude.

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:21.140
Whatever.

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:25.020
Do you have any other last minute stories for us, Loki?

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.020
Yeah.

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:30.880
This week in the US, uh, Virtual Console will be getting King's Knight on the NES and Power

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.940
Ball on Genesis.

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:35.500
I don't know what either one of those are.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.500
Sorry.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.060
That was something else.

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:41.140
I'm saving it for later.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.140
Okay.

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:45.140
Let's see here.

01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:54.060
So, uh, what have we got here, apparently some idiot is working on Mac OS X or something

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:57.460
that resembles Mac OS X for the PSP.

01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.940
Why?

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.340
Why?

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:05.220
Uh, there's some homebrew thing that someone made apparently that will remove duplicate

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.740
channels that you may have from playing import games.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:11.820
Uh, so that's kind of neat.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:22.580
Let's see here, and, uh, some rumors from EGM, including Tech Mobile is heading to the

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:27.700
Wii and the classic version of the game is coming to the DS, and apparently Warren Spector's

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:32.140
new Disney project that he's working on is a platformer and the goal is to give Mario

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:33.940
a run for his money.

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.940
The star of the big platformer would be none other than Mickey Mouse.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.100
Hmm.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:42.460
That'd be interesting.

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.460
That's it.

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.460
Alright.

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.740
Well, we're actually going to go ahead and close the Skype line because I just realized

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.020
we are running a little bit long.

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:52.020
It's almost, it's already midnight on the east coast, nine o'clock here, so we'll take

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:53.420
plenty more calls next week.

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.420
Don't worry.

01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:56.480
Uh, we're going to go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thoughts though

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.300
in the meantime because we're about ready to wrap up.

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:01.260
So, uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought for us tonight?

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.940
Milkshake.

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:07.460
My final thought is I would really like my appetite back.

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:12.420
Loki, my final thought is this chair is really uncomfortable.

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.420
Sorry about that.

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.420
It's alright.

01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:17.340
Hey, if I can find another fluffy chair like Dark Soccer is for cheap, I'll get one of

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:18.340
those.

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:21.540
This is metal, and that's why I keep standing up because it...

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:23.420
No, I'm sorry.

01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.740
Alright, well, that's it.

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:29.280
That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, and tune in again

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.740
next week for the last show on Live 365 where hopefully we'll be able to tell you what the

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:36.340
plan for the future is after that.

01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:40.660
Thank you guys as always for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:41.660
Really appreciate it.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.660
You guys are awesome.

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:43.660
Thanks for supporting us.

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:46.420
And remember, if you like Orange Lounge Radio, or even if you don't like this show, at least

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:50.820
spread the word and help independent radio break through because we don't have advertising

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:51.820
dollars.

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.140
We don't have big magazines behind us.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.460
We don't have any of that.

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:58.600
So that's going to do it.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:02.460
So until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:03.900
That's Dark Soccer.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.860
He's Loki, and together we are Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:16.300
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.820
