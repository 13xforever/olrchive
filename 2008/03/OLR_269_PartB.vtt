00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 2nd of 2008, where we're taping episode number 269 of Orange Lounge Radio live, as we do here every Sunday night, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
In Part A, you missed a whole bunch of Sony news. We talked about Metal Gear Solid 4, some of the new bundles that are coming out, the departure of Phil Harrison, just a lot of that.

00:23.000 --> 00:40.000
Now we're going to get into some Nintendo news in this segment. Yes, Logan? Yes. Now, of course, like most things, Nintendo hasn't made an official announcement on the Mario Kart Wii Date, but that doesn't mean that retailers haven't figured out when it's coming out.

00:40.000 --> 00:59.000
Including such wonderful websites as GameFly, GameStop, Circuit City, and I think a few others, have it listed as April 27th, that's two days before Grand Theft Auto 4, and that would also be a Sunday.

00:59.000 --> 01:22.000
Is this going to happen or not? Who knows? Do you think they're doing that to specifically get the jump on Grand Theft Auto 4, or is it kind of one of those, ah, I think they're going to be out of, you know, they need to press them, they need to have enough time to press those discs.

01:22.000 --> 01:38.000
And also, the other thing that's really going to hamper that game is the production of those two fucking wheels. It's absolutely retarded, but if you were a betting man, 27 would be a very good bet.

01:38.000 --> 01:52.000
Very good odds on that bet, alright. You know, maybe one thing that the game has been, because it was originally supposed to come out late last year, right? Wasn't it originally a Christmas release that got pushed back a little bit? Something like that, our first quarter, I don't know.

01:52.000 --> 02:03.000
Well, anyhow, perhaps one reason they pushed it back is because, guess what guys, Mario Kart Wii, it looks like Nintendo has finally caught on, Mario Kart Wii is going to have online chat in it.

02:03.000 --> 02:15.000
It's about time, I mean, Xbox has been doing this for years, right? Oh, I see. Mario Kart Wii will be supporting online text chat.

02:15.000 --> 02:26.000
That's right, you'll be able to send text messages to your friends over Mario Kart Wii, provided that they are on your friends list, you have their friend codes and all that stuff, you will be able to text.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
And you can do it before matches, it's assumed you can do it after matches. Not quite. Well, how does that work?

02:35.000 --> 02:49.000
You see, it's not like you would think at an IRC chat room or something like that. You can send them little pre-determined messages, like, I'm sad, or good game, and stuff like that.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Oh my god, for real? For real.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, it's not, like, as cool as you would think. Is there a way, I think, of trying to control the game right now?

02:59.000 --> 03:09.000
It's like the Disney MMO, I'm sorry, the news must have changed slightly since the initial release that I jammed in or whatever, so okay, so now it's been, it's like the Disney MMOs.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Like, if you've ever played, what is that, Toontown, I think it is? You only have a list of pre-selected phrases you can use.

03:14.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, that's the same shit. Yeah, you do not get to, um, actually chat in this, it's just little messages that you can send back and forth.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
Yay, hooray, you know, even though there's, you know, because god forbid we should, you know, shield our children from all sorts of filth out there, you know, all those people.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
People on your damn friends list playing Mario Kart, oh my god. Sad, sad, sad.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
RossdielUT says, I'm sorry, that's, I'm sorry, it's RansdielUT, their names are very similar tonight, I think that's Rama, another name.

03:48.000 --> 03:57.000
Uh, RansdielUT says, text chat, better than hearing F, M, G, N, N, I, M, E, R, and all that stuff on Waffling, so.

03:57.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, you know, I think that, in one respect, I think it's a good idea, you know, because they are trying to make an effort to protect their intended group, I should say.

04:14.000 --> 04:29.000
You know, which was why, you know, probably just needed the same thing with theirs, they don't want their, something with their name on it, for lack of a better description, to buy the people playing it, you know. So, in that way, I think it was smart.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
It's just playing a weight stamp today, that's all it is.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah, and RansdielUT continues in our chat room, chat.hollandjones.com, but if you're playing online with friends, you should be allowed to say whatever you want.

04:39.000 --> 04:50.000
You know, I would like to see a mode where, you know, okay, yeah, maybe it's off by default, but maybe I can go in there and turn it on or something, where, you know, if I want to call my friends gay while I'm playing, I should have the right.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
Here's a thought, I don't know, maybe filter the obscenities. Oh my god, that's so hard.

04:56.000 --> 05:09.000
It's like, it's stupid is what it is. It's absolutely stupid that you just jump through all these hoops to just frickin' play the game with your friends, and then after all that stuff, why even include text chat?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
You know, basically, um.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
So they can put a big sticker on the box, support online chat.

05:15.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah, I can do the report on this, and basically, uh, you know, selected, limited, select those automated statements and responses while playing the game. Like, hello, I'm sad, I'd say welcome, you know.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
RansdielUT asks, and yes, this time it is RansdielUT asks in chat room, why even make the stupid game online?

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, you know, for me, it's kind of like the DS game. I mean, how often do you go on a DS game and somebody is already there online waiting for you? That doesn't happen.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
You pre-arrange those matches over the internet on AIM, or you pre-arrange them over the telephone.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
So I'm thinking just fire up a Skype and voice chat.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
Okay, here's another thought, and this is a kind of support Nintendo on this decision.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
You remember back to Final Fantasy XI, they had predetermined text things that you could type in there.

06:02.000 --> 06:14.000
Because this game is being released in alternate regions with a bunch of different languages, now there's no sort of language barrier between other people because, you know, it's in their native language no matter where you're sending this, uh, phrase to.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Much like I think there's the same thing Fantasy Star Online.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
There's Final Fantasy XI?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah, there's Final Fantasy XI, like I said.

06:20.000 --> 06:29.000
So that's what this is, you know, supporting that feature, because this may be also the chat with the other people, not necessarily your friends that you're playing with as well.

06:29.000 --> 06:38.000
I just wish they would also have normal chatting in there as well on top of this stuff, but whatever.

06:38.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm looking at the JustinTV chat for a minute, and usually I don't take a chance to read it, but our old buddy AkumaJP is in there and says, uh, type while driving. Better.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
As if talking on your cell phone while driving wasn't bad enough, now you can type while driving.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Hey, well it's supposed to be remote, you know, you really only need one hand to kind of do that.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Can I put on my makeup while I drive too?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Alright.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh my god, that'd be an awesome, like, Wii game or whatever you're driving, you have to use the Wii remote to put up makeup.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Woman driver of the game.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Our...

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Okay, drag queen driver of that game.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Okay, that's better.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
That has to be kind of hot.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
You gotta put on your makeup and your stilettos while you're trying to drive.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Put on your furry costume on a Wii.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
And change the radio.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Hey, Mr. DJ, sorry to yell, can we move on please?

07:32.000 --> 07:41.000
Um, well, something that is actually fairly cool about Mario Kart Wii is that there is, um, an 8 finger bath mode.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Which is pretty cool.

07:43.000 --> 07:53.000
So, um, it looks like you'll be able to, um, well, I think they're determining this more from a screenshot,

07:53.000 --> 08:03.000
but it says that they have, uh, 8 people on, 8 icons, and, uh, lots of, uh, stuff on the path to throw at everybody else.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Can't wait for Mario Kart. I'm more excited about this game than Brawl.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Why is that?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Because I'm not really into the fighting games.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Mario Kart, I love Mario Kart. I bought every game system or every Nintendo system for Mario Kart.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Wait, even Double Dash?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Yes, I even bought Double Dash.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
But did you like Double Dash?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
It was okay.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
The battle mode in Double Dash really sucks balls, but, you know.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Well, sorry, Jamie, but what do you think of, uh, ePlayer Battle Mode?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I mean, is that a game selling thing for you, or?

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
Well, I'll probably get into it anyway, but I think that that's fair and cool, especially since I know enough people who have a Wii to participate in that much play.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I just wish it would, you know.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
I was thinking what you could do is have a laptop in with, uh, Ventrilo.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And maybe your snack coffee.

08:49.000 --> 08:58.000
That's true. But, you know, I don't, like, for me, my computer is all the way out here in the dungeon, a.k.a. garage, a.k.a. O.L.R. Makeshift Studio.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And then the Wii is all the way in there.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
So I can't really do that.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm just here for myself. I got my laptop. You got your MacBook?

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Alright, I got this. This involves two different game systems over here.

09:09.000 --> 09:20.000
Okay, what you can do is use your wireless communicator from your Xbox 360 and open a voice chat and that, and just not hook up the video to your TV and play the Wii online through your TV.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
So you've got voice chat and you're playing Mario Kart.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Can you come over and hook that all up?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
It's too many wires.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
Maybe I can get the best of my people to install it for me.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
If you don't want this to do, you're like, huh?

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Did we cover that story? I think it got cut from the show.

09:42.000 --> 09:51.000
At Best Buy, there was a sticker on an Xbox 360 game that said, have Geek Squad install this game on your Xbox 360.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
I've seen that and I've made fun of it in the store. I'm like, seriously.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
I always chalked it up to somebody got sicker happy and put stickers on the wrong thing.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
That's special.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Eject, put the game in, drop it down, push the eject button again, game goes in.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Okay, that'll be $50.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Nice.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
Now, maybe the PlayStation 3 installation, that might be something that's going to take so long for some of those games.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Alright, you know.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Well, we'll be handling it now.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
What's my poll cry?

10:24.000 --> 10:32.000
There's a game that I played a while back and I think maybe during one of these shows back at our old apartment, Rob, but it's a game called Defend Your Castle.

10:32.000 --> 10:41.000
It's a little flash game where you defend your castle against stick figures and get archers and all sorts of things to defend them.

10:41.000 --> 10:48.000
And also, basically what you do is you use your mouse to throw the stick figures away to keep away from your castle.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, now this is going to be coming to the WiiWare service as well.

10:53.000 --> 11:01.000
It's actually going to be completely from the ground up and it's only $5 or 500 Wii points, which is pretty awesome.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
And of course they built some new features into it as well.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
And apparently unlimited levels, the game will just keep getting harder until you can't play it anymore.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
So, that's pretty awesome.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I love games like that.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
The old school Atari 2600 games, it never ended.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Like Kaboom?

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
What do you mean tell something with Kaboom?

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
It's going faster.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
That's pretty awesome.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
Another game that they've already announced coming to the service a while back was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles My Life as a King.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
It's actually going to be a WiiWare launch title.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
The price has been revealed to be $15 or 1500 Wii points.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
And we'll be joining some other games as well, including of course Defend Your Castle and...

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
This one didn't make the list, but the major league eating the game, which looks like a piece of shit, and that will be...

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
But that's not what you're eating.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
No, it's not a piece of shit that you're eating, but the game looks like... looks like pooey.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Like stuff on your Wii.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
A piece of pooey.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
No one likes stuff on their Wii.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
And I've never heard of poo as an adjective, but there you go.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
And it's coming out May 12th in the US.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
Here's my question, is that the Final Fantasy game that was supposed to be the launch title?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Yeah, it's the Final Fantasy sort of SimCity mashup type thing.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
RossDielYajinachat says FFPC will also use your entire Wii memory, is that true?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
That would kind of suck.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't know about that, but they needed to figure out something with the whole Wii memory shit.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Seriously?

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
You know, if you can put these on a flashcard, maybe that's kind of cool, but from what I hear you can't, and that's kind of like...

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
I would like to think that maybe they can do an upgrade right when the WiiWare comes out and then you can start using flashcards, but who knows?

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
One thing that Nintendo can get right though is the peripherals, I mean they will crank out those Wii wheels for Mario Kart.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Here's the thing though that's kind of weird is that it will actually be sold separately other places.

12:56.000 --> 13:04.000
Fumitsu over in Japan has revealed that Nintendo is going to be selling the Wii wheels separately for about $11.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
No word yet if we're going to get that separately as well, but you know that if Nintendo doesn't officially put them out themselves, which they probably will,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
you're going to have third-party developers of the wazoo doing this.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
Because it does kind of make sense to have the separate Wii wheels because, you know, the same reason you have separate DDR pads.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Sometimes you want to play two-player.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
They will be coming out separately here at the same time as Mario Kart.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Oh really?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yes.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
And you know this to be fact.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
I know, it's a good fact.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Well there you have it then.

13:30.000 --> 13:39.000
And it's the same reason why, because a little screaming Billy wants fucking, you know, his own wheels and then wants to share it with his sister or something like that and say it's about two fucking plastic wheels.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
They're just plastic wheels, folks. And seriously, you can buy them now.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I mean, just third-party things.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
And it's completely, absolutely useless.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I mean, you don't need this thing to play the game.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
I love this. This is my favorite comment in the wild.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Rob SteelheapT in chat says,

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
Guys, say that the DDR pad has functionality and the Wii is a dumbass wheel.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Touche.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Touche.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
I just like the fact that this game controls with as many options as they have for Smash Brothers.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
Classic controller, GameCube, remote nunchuck, and then the thing sideways.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
No fucking way.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
DarkHatsuyu says,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
I wish there was a wheel that let the Wiimote fit vertically so I could use it on me for speed carving.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Well that's the thing too.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
That's the thing that pisses me off about this game.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
If you've ever played one of these games that uses the wheels sideways like, you know, Mario Kart says,

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
or like, say, some of these other games that use the wheels, it's really horribly uncomfortable.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
You know, Excite Truck uses the wheel, or the remote, actually vertical so that the buttons are on top of the thing,

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
and it's pretty comfortable doing it that way, but holding it sideways, you have to kind of contort your whole wrist,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
and it really hurts your hand playing it for a while.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
In related news, I still kind of like Excite Truck.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Excite Truck's fucking awesome, and they need to fucking make a new one!

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
I've already finished the game, my wife has finished the game, if that's saying something.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
For the love of God, give Loki's wife a game to get excited about.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Make poor tracks if you don't want to make a new game.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
I don't care, I will buy them for whatever price you want to charge.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I just need some more Excite Truck.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
I don't want to have to buy Motorstorm 2, one wasn't very impressive.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
That and custom soundtracks.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
I mean, Excite Truck was kind of neat.

15:24.000 --> 15:31.000
Okay, I can understand Excite Truck, that's fine, because that game really does need custom soundtracks.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
But like Endless Ocean? What the fuck?

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
You don't need custom soundtracks in that game.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
You can't swim through the ocean and rob zombies, it's just not right.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
It's too slow.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Excite Truck's fucking awesome.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
You could play through Excite Truck's physical leaks, now that we know.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
I always play Excite Truck to everything, from Eurobeat stuff to...

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
That makes sense.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
My wife, she likes playing it to Justin Timberlake for some reason.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
I know it's funny, but you know what?

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Every time I hear a Justin Timberlake song now, I think of Excite Truck.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
I get to play it to like, really cool shit.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
Speaking of marketing tools, I did find something very disturbing that my husband showed me on YouTube.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Using World of Warcraft to advertise Toyota trucks.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Oh yeah, that thing is hilarious, that commercial.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I finally saw it.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Oh boy.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
I just, I don't know, Excite Truck, it wasn't that hard to make, and I just hope they have the option to download more tracks for many a game.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
What if they were to do like, a different type of vehicle for an Excite something game?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
As long as it plays the same, I don't care.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Excite Boat.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Excite ATV, that would be one for a certain game.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Excite, here you go, Excite ATV on the Moon.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Whoa!

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Well they didn't have a space level, do you remember Nebula?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Oh, that's true.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
That's true.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Alright, okay.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
Now we've turned in our most current news, talking about Mario Kart Wii into Excite Truck or other things somehow.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
So, sorry, the best briefing game on the Wii then.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
You know, Mario Kart really should move on.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
I have some Wii related stuff only, it's more current in a virtual console.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
And specifically for our friends in the UK.

17:11.000 --> 17:20.000
The games that are coming out this week from PAL region is Super Turrican, that was a Super Nintendo game.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
And Psychosis, that was on the TurboGrafx-16.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Factor 5 named Super Turrican is 800 points.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
It uses the Classic and GameCube controller.

17:31.000 --> 17:39.000
Psychosis is 600 V-points, and it also uses the Classic and Cube pads, and also uses the V-mode.

17:39.000 --> 17:47.000
And for anyone who hasn't heard of Psychosis, because I know the TurboGrafx-16 could be on the obscure end, it's a side-scrolling shooter.

17:47.000 --> 17:56.000
You can also position satellites around your ship and still stuff it in.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Killing with satellites is awesome.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Hooray, killing!

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I agree.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
So, if you don't want to mod your Wii, there are other options now for you to be able to play import games.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Thanks to the freeloader.

18:10.000 --> 18:17.000
Of course, you may remember that from the GameCube, as being able to play wonderful import games.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Gojoskis is now offering the freeloader for the Wii.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
It's going to do a bunch of other things, though.

18:23.000 --> 18:30.000
It's going to be for $19.99 in the US, UK for £9.99, I believe.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
And it's going to allow a couple of different things to happen.

18:34.000 --> 18:41.000
One, it will stop any updates that are on the game disc, so you don't end up with duplicate channels and import stuff.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
That's kind of what happens. Not a big deal, but annoying.

18:44.000 --> 18:56.000
And it will also be kind of invisible to your console, so that they hope that there will be no updates to destroy it, like they did with the GameCube one.

18:56.000 --> 19:04.000
It is available now, and hopefully will be broken soon.

19:04.000 --> 19:14.000
So, you know, we had a little bit of controversy last week, and I'm sure it's going to continue on into our Mailbag and Skype statements this week.

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
Would you say there is a legitimate, non-shady purpose for this?

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah, there's a lot of games that come out in Japan that we don't get here, or even in Europe that we don't get here.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
And, you know, for those people that really want to legitimately import stuff, you know, this is great to do.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
It's expensive, but, you know, it's great to import games.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Or get stuff early.

19:39.000 --> 19:51.000
So, like on my GameCube, I had Silver Caliber 2, and I also had one of the Battletoad Fighters, you know, back and forth, all of them over here.

19:51.000 --> 19:58.000
You know, if this was more like, you know, the DS or something like that, where it was a region 3, I think you'd see a lot more people buying games from other regions, you know.

19:58.000 --> 20:08.000
Here's my crowd, or here's my question to the crowd about, you know, because we had kind of two different, very opposite sides, talking about whole modding and all that stuff last week.

20:08.000 --> 20:16.000
My question is, to the people that are not, that do not support mod chips and piracy and all that stuff, is the freeloader ethical?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
That's my question, I'm kind of curious.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
Like, are you okay with the freeloader, seeing that there is a very legitimate purpose to it?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I would think so, because you can't pirate games with it.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Ah, okay.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
You know, as far as we're aware, I mean, you can't pirate games with it, but...

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Is it one of those it's just a matter of time things?

20:33.000 --> 20:41.000
Who knows, I mean, with the freeloader, I mean, I don't think, he can change the region on it, so, who knows?

20:41.000 --> 20:47.000
I mean, because it's obviously tricking the console into thinking something that, you know, is not really there.

20:47.000 --> 20:58.000
My thing would be, like I said, you know, because now we're getting these staggered release dates, you know, like Mario Kart in the UK is coming out, you know, a couple weeks before, you know, the US release.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
I mean, if you really wanted to, you could actually get that name early in English and be able to play it.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Comments from chat, rostielut says, well, if you can't pirate games, then by all means.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Son of Dad says, yes, I just want to play the games.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
DJ Jenai says, yes, I want to play all games no matter what.

21:13.000 --> 21:28.000
There's another thing, too, that actually was mentioned on the blurb on the freeloader sales area, was that for people who have non-region systems, that this is a way to play local games.

21:28.000 --> 21:39.000
Like, I, you know, I actually have a few friends who, you know, bought their Wii when they lived in Japan and moved back to the US and couldn't buy local games, had to import everything.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
And in case you're wondering, too, this will also allow you to play any region GameCube games as well.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
So if you had one of the GameCube freeloaders and stopped working on it because of the update, this will fix it.

21:50.000 --> 22:03.000
All right. Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing some feedback from some of our listeners, because I know we have a lot of listeners that are into import gaming, because one of the fewer gaming podcasts actually cover kind of the import team outside of just America.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
So I'm kind of curious what one of our listeners, some of our listeners should use this.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Are you getting one, Loki, or are you not bothering to get one?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm not bothering, but I have a hardship.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I have a hardship.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
So, you know.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Director, you are going to be getting one, right?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I am going to get one. I'm kidding.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Let me know what you think.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
I don't have any import games to test it on except for my GameCube one.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Thank you, Barbara.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
Look at me volunteering.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Me, personally, I don't get to import games enough to get one.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
The only import game I've ever really gone crazy for was the media studio.

22:33.000 --> 22:41.000
I say I used to get crazy all the time on PS2, but, you know, even the little footage you did, you know I had to get Buzzfeed back in the day.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah, I actually have a Japanese PlayStation 2.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
I still do. I wonder if it works.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
I have a Japanese Dreamcast.

22:45.000 --> 22:52.000
For some reason I decided that Wangian Midnight for the PS3, that was a mistake, and I can't import any more PS3 games.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Was it not good?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
It was shit.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Does it play?

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
Yeah, it plays just fine. PlayStation 3s are region 3, so.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Alright.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Alright, anyhow.

23:02.000 --> 23:12.000
Let's move on, because speaking of the mailbag, I know we want to get there and it's coming right up, but real quick, I want to give you one more Wii story, and that's about Wii Fit.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Wii Fit has been given a price in Europe.

23:14.000 --> 23:23.000
If you're going to buy the game in the UK, it's going to be 69.99, but the rest of Europe will pay 89.99 in the, you know, Euros.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
It's 69.99 pounds, 89.99 Euros.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
If you convert it to US dollars, that's about 130.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
It's already been announced that in the US it will come out for under 100 dollars.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
I'm not sure if we know an exact price yet.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Maybe if I think really hard, one will come to me.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, hmm.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
What would be a good price for that?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
I'm thinking.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Make it nice and simple.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
99.99?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
No, 99.99 would be too much I would think.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, well how about 89.99?

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
That's about right.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
That sounds like a good price for that.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
I think that's pretty fair.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Alright, 89.99, you think that would be a good price?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I think that's a good price for that, yeah.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I'd buy it for 89.99.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I'd buy that for 89.99.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
Alright, well anyhow, but you know, face it, in Europe, unfortunately, you are paying more for games usually.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
So while we might get it for 89.99, might get it for 89.99, we possibly will get it for 89.99.

24:21.000 --> 24:27.000
You guys will have to pay 89.99 Euros, which is considerably more.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Sorry to break it to you.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Alright, anyhow, let's open up the old mailbag.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
We love to hear from our listeners and every week you guys email us at mailbag.org.com.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
DarkStalker likes to dive into the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite emails.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
She's going to read them right now.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
I have my snorkel ready.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
And your rubber gloves?

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Just in case of the Ambrac.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
Uhhh, can I draw?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I think I have, well no, no, no, no, no, I have something far better.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm talking about that 80s band, not the uh...

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I like Ambrac!

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Alright, sorry.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Excuse me, Ambrac from Public Enemy is like the best combination ever.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Hi!

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
Speaking of great bands in the past, do you know what band really needs to...

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
I've decided after all the commercials on TV, do you know what band really needs to come to Rock Band?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
What?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Jefferson Airplane.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Oh, hell yeah!

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Alright, sorry, mailbag?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I don't know.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
You don't need to get me started because I was exploring my favorite old band.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
But anyway.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And it became Starship.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Yes, Jefferson Starship.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Anyway, pardon me.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
You need to see the Lost Odyssey commercial with the white rabbit music.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
It's pretty awesome.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Oh, you do too, thank you.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Alright, please do.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Okay, first email is from Cheezburger.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
Hi guys, I just got another viewpoint card and I already spent $40 on it.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
The games I have right now are Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario World, Donkey Kong, Paper Mario, and Star Fox.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Star Fox.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
Boy, do you flip it there, Ms. Zarka?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I don't know that.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I'm going to throw that mic or something.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
There's a little rock band in this room.

26:11.000 --> 26:17.000
This is why we don't have text chat.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
After the show, are you going to get a coffee at Star Fox?

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Sorry.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
That was just my broken finger, of course, extending on its own.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
I got to get a shot in my hand.

26:31.000 --> 26:37.000
Anyway, I was wondering what other good games are on there that I should get.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Thanks guys, you get me through the week.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Dude, you did not get Super Metroid.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Get it.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Oh, so you need more game recommendations.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Super Metroid.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Yeah, definitely some Super Metroid.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Devil's Crush.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
No, it was Alien Crush.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Guardian or Gunstar Heroes.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Gunstar Heroes, Alien Crush.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Yeah, your list needs more Sega.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
I think that there was not enough Sega in the list.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
This is only three hours.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Yeah, I think they all are.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
Mario Kart 64.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Mario 64.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Maybe Mario Kart, like, gathering those.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Mario Kart.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Oh, I bet that's the Mario Kart you got here.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
I bet.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
You want Super Metroid now.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Get Mario.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
And go get Super Metroid.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Darkstalker, a chat room, wanted to see if you would get this reference.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Okay.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
The baseline is the opening of the...

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I'm waiting for the chorus.

27:45.000 --> 27:52.000
Oh, it's going to cut off before the chorus.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
It's Starfuckers by the name of it.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
No, I don't...

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
I know, because I don't really like that song.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
But it does have a sweet bass line.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
The bass line is what made me think of that song, actually.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Oh, okay.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I did see this really awful band, and we went outside, and their bass line...

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
It was a band called 8-Bit.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
They weren't very good.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
So they were rapping and wearing half-nap suits.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
But we were coming back from drinking at the pyramid across the street.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
This is at the Gilman in Berkeley.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
And we came back and stood outside, and their bass line was The Legend of Zelda theme.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Their bass line was...

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
They were awful, though.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I thought it was awful.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
But Babyland played that show, so Babyland reviewed the whole thing.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
All right.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Moving on, please.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
Okay, it seems like there's some head tracking popping up lately in console world.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
Everyone keeps looking at Sony One at GDC.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
I'm surprised nobody knows what the TrackIR is that's been going around for years.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
I have one, and it works great.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
It is only for the PC, though it has six degrees of movement.

29:14.000 --> 29:21.000
And you can use it as a mouse control so that you can use it with any game that doesn't have direct support for the TrackIR.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
It's really huge for racing and flight games.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
There is one FPS game that it does support.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And that's from Pendragon.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
I guess this game should be used for Marble Madness.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Heck yeah, that's a game we need a new version of.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
Or even better, to watch someone play, like, Golden Key.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Nice.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
It's a little competitive.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
You bring your head around.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
All right.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
That's all we got.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Next, even.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Loki, Darth Vader, and Sky.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
With regards to the call and last episode about system hacking,

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
I have to comment, true, if there was some of the content that it hacked,

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
firmware allows you to play games without paying for them.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And even though this can be seen as wrong,

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
I think that it's kind of funny that they can do this in the first place.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
But some of the firmware is better than the proper firmware.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
For example, a Skype program is only for thin PFCs.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
If they can get it to work on thick PFCs, more power to them.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
As it is more fierce, everything works on those systems.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Also, if they can get three games that people make to work

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
that as cool as home-made games are good.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
I also believe that if you do stop talking about hacks,

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
then you would mess up on a huge part of the gaming world.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And I'm just saying this only as a reply to the call.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I know you won't.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
Secondly, you often talk about how the PlayStation 3 is a joint letdown,

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
but I have to say,

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
fair play that there are a lot more games than the Xbox 360,

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
but I am the only person I make up for friends to have a PS3,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
and I will think every single one of the other Xboxes

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
has three rings at one point or the other.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Finally, keep up the good show and hope Skype feels better.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Why not?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Well, thank you. I am feeling better.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
And you do bring up an issue about...

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Oh, I still sniffle a lot. My sciences are still kind of weird.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Anyway, you do bring up a good issue about the whole...

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
The firmwares definitely do serve a legitimate purpose,

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
and I think that's how a lot of the people get away with this

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
and get them to the radar,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
because there is a legitimate purpose for a lot of this,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
but I think it just becomes a moral issue about how you choose to use it.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
I mean, if you choose to use it to get Skype on your PSP,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
which is free anyway, that whole thing,

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
I don't think that's as big of a moral problem, so to speak,

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
as getting this on there so you can hack-store all the NES games from your past

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
or better yet, download all the PlayStation 1 games you always want to play

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
and all that, or PSP games.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
You know, that's just a moral problem. I'm not saying one's right or wrong,

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
because there's a lot...

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
You know, a lot of people steal music like there's no tomorrow.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
Well, there's a lot of legitimate things that they've started in homebrew

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
that I think Sonya saw, and they're like,

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
hey, let's throw that into an official release.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Like, for example, internet streaming radio.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
That's been available on the homebrew scene for a long time now,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
and then they, what, locked up.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
They finally implemented some of that stuff.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
I don't know. There's a lot of stuff that comes out of there.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
They have YouTube stuff that you can view now straight on your PSP.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.000
You know, they had stuff that hooked up to your GPS a while back,

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
even before they had the GPS for the PSP.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
There's a lot of stuff, and now they're coming out with Hercorals.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
They're like kill-centered stuff. It's Chrome group.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
Basically, you have the force. It's your choice if you wish to turn to the dark side.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Yeah. All right.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Next e-mail?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Sure.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
Hey, OLR crew. I was just e-mailing to give my side of the modding talk.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
I was apparently crucified simply for asking what the legitimate question by Rosso UT...

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Hold up. Is this the e-mail?

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
This is the one that Rosso UT had called in to respond to last week.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Same person, I'm assuming?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I think so, yeah.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Just curious. Just want to get that out there.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Because he doesn't agree with modding.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Mod chips are part of gaming culture and community.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
Just because they can do bad doesn't mean people are doing bad things with them.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
I can include a whole bunch of negative comments towards Rob, Jamie, and Loki,

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
but I have this thing where I go and attack people I've never met or know nothing about.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
Rob doesn't want to attack us. We're super cool.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
Rob was the only one who even bothered to give me a fair chance.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I gave him a fair chance.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
What did I do? All right. Whatever.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
I think he must have typed this right as he was listening to the call.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Give it a little slack.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
Not all of the people who do mod are people who sit behind our computers wearing a ski mask trying to steal games from the internet.

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
People back up their DVDs and music CDs, so I've seen their reviews of why it's such a gray area when it comes to games.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
Some people use mod chips to preserve their investments, others are interested in the technical aspects of it,

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
and yet they are the group who simply wish to steal games.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
I like hearing Loki's talk about him trying to fix the 360 and all the modifications he does to it along with the Bmod.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
It's just part of gaming culture and I'm glad LLR doesn't filter topics like this.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
I just wish that some listeners wouldn't jump down the road to people who are interested in modding.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
Next time my $50 game gets destroyed out of my hands, I'll send you anti-modders the bill.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
And Loki, you helped me a lot with your tips.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
I got my mod, I got my chips successfully installed so no more coasters for me.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Epic Glyn. I hope you feel better than Sweet Rob's HP for friends.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
But this email is prompted by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending Dallas, Arizona.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
You need to have Olive Garden night pretty soon.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Or surreal in how you have food for once.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I don't know though.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I can actually go to get food.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I just ate there a couple days ago.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
I'm just saying that I can, I found things I can eat.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Yeah, they have all their altered puffs and stuff.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Okay, here's the deal.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
I totally agree with what he's saying about that it is a part of gaming culture and that's what we're all about,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
so that's why we need to cover it on the show.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
And I think he made some good points.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I think the con made some good points.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Here's something you've got to understand though, is that we have a lot of,

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
I shouldn't say a lot, but we do have some developers, authors,

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
people that make games that actually listen to this program.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
And I'm sure it might ruffle their feathers a little bit to hear about this kind of talk that we're talking about these games.

35:33.000 --> 35:40.000
We don't advocate that you should go and steal a bunch of games because you're taking money from these people.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
But that's why people get passionate about the issue because a lot of folks listen to the show,

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
they might work in games or make games and they hear about these things that allow people to steal their work

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
and that's why there's layoffs at game companies and things go down and dah, dah, dah.

35:54.000 --> 36:00.000
So I don't know, but it's almost like, here, I don't know, kind of taking it a step further.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
As long as this stuff continues, it's going to be interesting because I think the game industry has the potential to turn into

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
almost kind of what the music industry is doing where I think especially through things,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
that's why I said last week, I think that XNA thing is such huge news

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
because I think in the future you're going to start seeing a lot more download your games

36:17.000 --> 36:23.000
and indie developers making things in-house that you download, just kind of like music is turning into

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
where more stuff is getting out there because of iTunes and stuff.

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
But I think we're about five, maybe even ten years away from that, but anyhow.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
That's my ramble.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Yeah, my little ramble.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
There's no easy solution.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
There's nothing any of us are going to say that's going to please both sides of it.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
I think, though, we're doing a disservice by ignoring it.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
Ignoring it's not going to make it go away.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
Personally, I have no problem with that, but someone wants to do.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
It's not my place to tell anybody what they can or can't do.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
It's just up to them if they want to deal with the consequences of being caught.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Right, and here's one thing.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
Realize at any time one of these companies may come up with a magic patch

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
that's going to nerf your Wii if you mod it, and there's going to be no choice.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
You're going to have to install the thing to play the latest game or something.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
It's not just going to render the game an apple.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
It's going to completely nerf your freaking Wii.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
You're bricking iPhones.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Exactly, bricking iPhones and all that stuff, so that's the chance you take.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
Someday your thing's going to get bricked, and that's the chance you took.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Yeah.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
There you have it.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
That's it.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
For me.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Next email.

37:36.000 --> 37:43.000
Hi Sky, Lucy, and DarkSakura, I'm emailing you on behalf of the semi-obliterated PS2 sitting in a bag in my room.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
The other day I arrived at school suspecting it would be like any other day,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
one of my friends informed me in his wisdom,

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
since PS2 stopped working the previous afternoon,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
and actually he took a hammer to the case and smashed it open.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
The irony here is that before the fan had only chipped a few teeth,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
and now the case is done for, the melting from the inside are bent,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
and the laser may be broken, but I'm not sure.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
One of the ribbons has been damaged.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I've taken the console from him,

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
and I was just wondering whether any of you know of a good site that I could get spare parts from,

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
and particularly if lucky enough there were a way to test the laser,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
with a lot of parts on the needle.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
I know you can order replacement parts from Sony,

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
but you could pretty much.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I don't know if you can still order stuff from them,

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
but I was going to say,

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
I don't know, the only way to test the laser, I would think,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
is to put a game in it and actually test it.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
For spare parts though, you might be able to check out llama.com.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
I've gotten some Xbox 360 mods set from there.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
I don't know if they carry PlayStation 2 stuff anymore, I think they do.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
Do they have like official, I'm sorry, Microsoft,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
do they have like official Sony repair centers,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
like they have for some other types of products?

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
Like maybe there's a place you can take your PS2 and get just the laser thingy tweaked?

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
Maybe.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
I don't know.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
I'm sorry, I might have missed it.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
How old did you say the PlayStation 2 was?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Did you say it was like an old school one?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Um, it did not say.

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
You know, if it's one of the old school, you know, huge, you know, PlayStation 2s,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
the old model, it might just be time,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
because obviously by the time you fix some of this stuff,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
you're practically paying what you pay for a PS2 mini.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
People put broken ones on these days, they're too lengthy.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Yeah.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Yeah, you can, I mean, they're kind of getting cheap now,

39:27.000 --> 39:33.000
you can probably find a cheap PS2 for, you know, nothing.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
I mean, Rockdale UT in chat says,

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
if the system isn't too bashed up, you can get it fixed at www.oldschoolgamer.ca,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
but that indicates it's Canadian.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
I don't know if that would work.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
Yeah, I mean, your cables and stuff, your ribbon cables,

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
they're about $10, and then the lens is about $40.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
So right there, it's $50, that's half the price of your PS2, mine is $99.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
Okay, I'm looking on the Gamestop website,

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
and I don't know, we can go and buy some Gamestop,

40:09.000 --> 40:19.000
but the old style PS2 refurb is $79.99, so the new style is $99.99.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
And if you find them at just the used ones, they'll be cheaper than that.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
And some of that is pointing out the Target was actually having a sale on PS2s last week for $99 new.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
So, there you go.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Yeah, there you have it.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Keep an eye on those websites, you know,

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
I'm sure that's not the answer you wanted to hear, that we're telling you,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
basically go buy a new PS2.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
But keep an eye on those websites like CheapAssGamer

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
and some of those other video game deals websites too,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
once in a while something might pop up there, so, you know, always keep an eye on it.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
But if you do want to get your old system fixed,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
there are ways that you might have to have a professional step in

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
or you're going to void your warranty.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
It just might as well, at this point, just to buy a new one.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
I mean, there's a point you got to say, well,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
six months is a fix, it's just buy a new one.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
But RossCOUT and Chapman have a good point.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Once he's a Final Fantasy XI player,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
MIDI PS2 won't support the HDD.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Then buy an older one.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
And quit Final Fantasy XI.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
I'm just kidding.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
I'm just kidding.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Oh yeah, you got to go to PC first.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
All right, anyhow, sorry. More email?

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
Hey, I was a controller player on this machine.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I don't know how you play that game on a controller.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
You've got me doing it.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
I know, I just, and it was designed for controllers, the hilarious thing,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
but I cannot play that game on anything by keyboard.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
The macros are so easy with triggers.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
They're really, really easy.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
But anyway.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
All right, anyhow.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Hey everyone, before I begin, there's a couple things I must say.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
First of all, hail Jamie.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Worship.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Yes.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Who is this?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Oh, okay.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Ah, got me some new shoes.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Anyway.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Secondly, I want to say that I look forward to each episode Sunday night

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
and the podcasts that get me through my daily commute to and from work.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
Now that the formalities are out of the way, just let me say this.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
As I listen to Rosalie T's thoughts on modding,

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
I can tell that you Rob weren't too happy about that.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
I can tell in your voice that you weren't that happy about that.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
Let me just say that my PS2 has been modded for three plus years.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
During that time, I have over $1,000 worth of bootleg games.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Why?

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
Simply because I do not have the money to shell out each week to buy new titles.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
But all is lost.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
On the positive side, playing crappy games allowed me the chance to play

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
and try out some of the games to see if I like it.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
Honestly, no one here wants to drop 40 bucks on a PS2 game

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
to find out later that the game sucks some of the waste.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Having a modding console allows me to check out important games as well.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
When I write this, I tend to think of myself as a hypocrite

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
because my real job consists of fixing computers with bootleg software.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
I tell the customers not to use bootleg enterprise corporate software

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
as well as software that belongs to a friend of theirs.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
But alas, some will not listen,

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
unlike also UTA does not take this to heart.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Overall, I do not see a problem with modded consoles.

43:02.000 --> 43:08.000
Mods allow us to break things with consoles, not just copy slash burn games.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
Now, if I download a game that's really good, then I would go out and buy it.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Case in point, Kingdom Hearts 2.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
As a friend who is in the gaming industry

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
that gives me grief about copy games,

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
I say to her, are you going to buy me this game?

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
No, you're not.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Plus, I want to see if the game is actually worth buying.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
And if it is, I'll buy it.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
In the meantime, leave me be.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
Overall, roughly, if you eat, shut up.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
It doesn't matter to us.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
We are not damaging the gaming industry at all.

43:36.000 --> 43:43.000
From my knowledge, there's no proof of that as either.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
There's usually what it comes down to,

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
and this is the same argument with MP3 downloading and stuff like that,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
is everyone says that's a cycle thing.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
It's just another cycle.

43:53.000 --> 43:59.000
It's just people, the industry doesn't actually lose money from these people

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
because these people are never going to buy the product in the first place.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
So you didn't miss out on a sale because they were never going to buy it.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Same with people downloading import games or something like that.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
They weren't going to buy it in the first place.

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
The modern thinking is it's not going to hurt anybody.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
Obviously, still, they could import it and spend the money and do that kind of stuff.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
I don't know.

44:23.000 --> 44:29.000
It's immoral, maybe, but is it really hurting the industry?

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Maybe.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Not quite.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I don't know.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
Say, for example, a lot of people are burning copies of Halo 3 or something like that.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
Yeah, that's going to hurt the sales of that game,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
especially if they were intending on buying it in the first place.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I don't know.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
That's why a lot of companies now, though, and a lot of things that come out,

44:51.000 --> 44:58.000
they spend the time on extra stuff like the packaging and the bonus stuff that comes with it

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
to entice people to actually buy their games instead of just letting it work.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
And here's another thing.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Maybe people respect your games more.

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
Stop putting out shovelware looking at you, Destiny.

45:11.000 --> 45:17.000
Just to address the part of the letter that talked about me getting kind of,

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
I don't know what he said about the call, but I didn't see half of that.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
Here's the thing.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Well, A, I was sick last week, so coming from Slack.

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
So that kind of lends my sense of professionalism a little bit out the window,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
especially because having a cam here doesn't help you.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
If I make a motion or something, everybody sees it.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
But also, it wasn't that I was unhappy about the statement

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
because I believe everybody has the right to their opinion

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
whether I personally agree with it or not.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
And it makes me sad to see listeners attacking each other and stuff,

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
you know, hug it out, agree to disagree.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Here's the thing.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I kind of knew.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
And that's interesting in a way.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
It's part of the charm of the show.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
We open up this guideline.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Anybody can call about anything.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
You don't know what it's going to be.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
And we're going to deal with it and talk about it on air.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
It's kind of part of what makes this show unique.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
But when the call came in, I kind of knew that it was opening a can of worms,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
and that's why I wasn't happy.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
It's not that I wasn't happy with the opinion or whatever.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I wasn't happy because I was just kind of like,

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
oh, boy, I know there's going to be e-mails on this next week

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
and probably some more calls later on tonight.

46:19.000 --> 46:26.000
I was like, oh, I don't know if this was an epic battle I was awaiting.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
The rest of this e-mail.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Thanks for reading my letter on air.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
And, Rob, I apologize for using your shared call on the OLR listener,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
but I cannot read this.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
And allow traffic to be in the comments of Roswell, Utah, to go by unnoticed.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
Rock on and have a most triumphant week.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
If Roswell, Utah, wants to comment back by all means,

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
my e-mail, Addie, is listed, and I guess you can p.m.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Yeah, they're both in chat right now.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Hug it out, boys.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Hug it out.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
And he wants me to plug his podcast, so I am.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Okay, fair enough.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
Anime Jam Session at djromnet.net slash Anime Jam.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
So listen to it.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
But not right now, because we're live.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
All right.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Any other e-mails, or is that it?

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
This one.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Dang, we have talent e-mails tonight.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
I know.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
All right, let's get through them.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Hey, OLR crew, I have a question for Dark Sakura.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Hey, cool.

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
You said months ago that you could pump up the volume on hold after your laptop got fried.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
You know, that's how my PC got fried.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
How is that coming along?

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
It would be great to listen to pump up the volume again someday.

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
It's a nice break from what the 24-7 stream provides on GS68.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
Actually, there's progress in this today.

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
I've had a computer that I could use, but the problem is that I want something with

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
a bit more on the graphics capability side, just for the sake of all the other projects

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
I do.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
And I have been using my laptop, but my laptop likes to run really freaking slow.

47:53.000 --> 47:58.000
I think I'm actually going to replace all the memory in it.

47:58.000 --> 48:05.000
But we have gutted out one of the Vio's sitting in our garage.

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
And although one of them is promised, that sort of leaves the other one up in the air

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
because it might be promised as well.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
We are looking into putting a graphics card in it.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
My old hard drive, basically building a new Frank computer for me.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
That was what my old computer was, sort of the Frankenstein part.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
Pump up the volume, it's all just a plan.

48:31.000 --> 48:36.000
I'm looking for a return of pump up the volume soon.

48:36.000 --> 48:43.000
However, I'm also going back to college, which I don't know if I've mentioned to my co-host

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
here.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
But I am planning on going back to school and I'm finishing a degree this year and finishing

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
one next year too.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
I forbid you learning more.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
What is this education you speak of?

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
You don't mean that.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
I am a year away.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
You am educated enough.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
I'm a year away from an AA.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
I'm another year away from another AA.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
And then I can go.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
By the way, for those that may not know, because we do have the podcast, when she speaks of

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
pump up the volume, she's talking about one of her weeknight shows.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
Yeah, it was when I said it didn't suck.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
And we do have a couple of weeknight shows, just a handful right now.

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
I've got to be honest, if I didn't have a full-time job, trying to manage all that stuff

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
is difficult.

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
So I don't know, we may soon try to hire, for the pay is great, nothing, but some type

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
of director of weeknight programming that can get some of these great podcasts that

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
deserve to be heard on the live stream.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Just to try to sort that all out.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
But then we have our website.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
You can get updated too much.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
No time?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Hey, good news.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Cheeseburgers taking RFI.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
What's that?

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Oh, buying Super Mentor.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Yep.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Swell.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
Alright, one more email.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Last email.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Dun dun dun.

50:05.000 --> 50:16.000
So this is worth it, because this is our buddy, Warrior Bob.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
Yay.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Hi, host.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Hi, emailer.

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
It's so good to hear you mentioning the old Apogee and Epic software games last week.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
Respected memories from times when computer games looked like computer games.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
This is a topic that's been coming up recently in the looks of my friends and me.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
Back when these games were the forefront of computer entertainment, back when Windows

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
had version numbers, PR made adventure games, and Duke Nukem games weren't named after

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
the development time.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I see what you did there.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
There was a certain look and feel to computer games.

50:49.000 --> 50:54.000
The visual animations and effects were the product of teams of technical artists, so

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
much as they were the result of clever programming tricks done by empty people.

50:58.000 --> 51:04.000
Things like single pixel particle effects, characters made of multiple sprites, color

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
cycling distortions, that sort of thing.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
I feel that it's kind of gone now, and I realize I missed it.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Don't get me wrong, I love the new ideas, too.

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
I wanted to see games like Shadows of Colossus and Rock Band ever since I was a little kid

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
with a bunch of game design scribbles in my notebook.

51:20.000 --> 51:25.000
But at the same time, the only recent game I can think of that had the same computerized

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
feel I grew up on was Cave Story, a freeware indie title.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Entrenched as you all are in the video game scene, had you come across any games that

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
still embody this aesthetic?

51:35.000 --> 51:41.000
I find I play games more for the experience than the challenge these days, and so I'd

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
love to find something like this and see what people with new ideas have done with old styles.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Thanks again, as always.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Keep up the excellent show, Warrior Bob.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
P.S.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
Hi, Dan.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
I guess he was at first.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
He was supposed to be on the show this week, too.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
That's why I couldn't even put that.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
That makes sense.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
I know, and butthead didn't come, so whatever.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
Here's my crazy thought, is that they don't make these games anymore because they just

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
didn't sell?

52:05.000 --> 52:13.000
I have to say this, is that, and for lack of a, you know, I'm not trying to be mean

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
to anybody, but honestly, the market today is a lot more fickle.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
They want it to look pretty, you know.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
They don't care as much about the game, you know, the way the game plays.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
They don't care as much about the experience of the game.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
They want it to be pretty, and automatically it's not pretty as shit.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
So that's what's happened.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
They're playing towards a superficial market.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
I think you're kind of right.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
I think that is kind of what it boils down to.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
Absolutely, computer games kind of lost their distinctive look, so to speak.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
But then I look at a game like Sam & Max, and to me, that game is like a, it's almost

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
a throwback in a way.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
It is kind of like those old LucasArts games, but in a newer, cartoony, visual-ish style.

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
So, I mean, they're out there, but yeah, it's not like it used to be then.

52:57.000 --> 53:03.000
I remember walking into A-Head Software, and you'd have like, you know, Legend of Kyrandia

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
and King's Quest and all this stuff for sale, and you know, those were the days, but you

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
know, then again, A-Head Software went out of business.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
So that tells me that, or at least they're online now or whatever, so that tells me that

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
you know, they just must not have been selling as well, as consoles really took off.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
I love Kyrandia.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Me too!

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
My sister still plays, in fact, she is playing King's Quest VII right now.

53:22.000 --> 53:29.000
I'll tell you what was funny, is I came very close to downloading a mug.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Those still running.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
That's awesome.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
There's a mug still running.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
I'll have to find the link for you, but there's people who still do them.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.000
There's BBS's set up so people can play Legend of the Red Dragon still online, which is like

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
hard, and The Pit.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
Dude, we need an OLR BBS so we can play The Pit.

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
You know what my first, I would have to say real MMO was?

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Gemstone 3.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Awesome.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
It was all text.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Dude, how can we set up an OLR BBS?

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
I know it's going to be possible to be like Telnet or something.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
How can we make that happen?

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
That shouldn't be possible.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Somebody email me if you know how to make that happen.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I wouldn't think that would be a good idea.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
I know.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
The OLR BBS, we're going to play The Pit with our wizards.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
That'd be Red Train Wars.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
That'd be bomb.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
That would be, that would be fun.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Warrior Bob is actually in chat right now and says, see, yeah, that's just it.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
FemiMax looks like a new 3D game.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
No big pixels or clever animation anywhere.

54:22.000 --> 54:29.000
Oh yeah, I think just the market, big pixels didn't sell, I guess.

54:29.000 --> 54:34.000
Well, I mean, if you, if you want sprite-based stuff, I mean,

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
you still got, you know, like I'm playing Ragnarok online and honestly,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I've read up on Ragnarok too.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
And while, yeah, it's cool, facial animation, ooh, you know, I,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I like my cute few sprites.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
You know, I think it's cool.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
I like that I can play it on a system that I don't have to have a whole

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
bunch of crap for because it still plays pretty damn fun.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
You know, I, and I like Lulu.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
I love Lulu.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Lulu is such a good game.

55:02.000 --> 55:08.000
And I miss my old pixely games like Doom and Hexen.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
I love Hexen.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
I've covered Hexen.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Good times.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
That's it for tonight.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Alrighty.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Get a piece of the war.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Dang, there was a lot of mailbags this week.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
I know.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
Mailbag to OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send your emails.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Hexen!

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Alright, let's get back to some gaming news.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
The segments weren't involved tonight.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I know.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Oh yeah, that would be neat, wouldn't it?

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
No.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
Nope.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
No, it's fine.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
It's up.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Yeah.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I'm looking at one.

55:38.000 --> 55:46.000
So, um, this whole Activision Blizzard merger thing, uh, happened a little bit ago, you

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
know, when they merged with Nvidia.

55:49.000 --> 55:54.000
And, uh, because of that, some investors think that they're getting the bum end of the deal.

55:54.000 --> 56:00.000
And in fact, actually, it's an Activision investor who sued over the entire merger.

56:00.000 --> 56:07.000
Um, their complaint was that Nvidia actually comes out on top of the merger with 50% majority

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
ownership of Activision.

56:08.000 --> 56:15.000
Um, and because of this, uh, didn't think that the stockholders, uh, or didn't think

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
of the stockholders when they accepted the deal.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.000
So, that is their complaint and now they're, you know, pissed off about it.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
I don't know.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
I mean, shit.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Nvidia has some pretty good properties.

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
I don't think it's totally bad that they merged together, but I don't know.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
You're a stockholder.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
I guess you're getting jipped out of a few bucks.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
Well, we must live in a sue-happy world because that wasn't the only lawsuit that happened

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
this week.

56:43.000 --> 56:48.000
Capcom officially got sued by the MKR Group over the game Dead Rising because the MKR

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
Group, they own the rights to the movie Dawn of the Dead by George Romero.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
And even though Dead Rising has a big old thing on it that says not Dawn of the Dead,

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
essentially, uh, Capcom got sued.

56:57.000 --> 57:04.000
And as interesting as, I don't think they're going to win because the fact that, I mean,

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
can they really sue for, you know.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
But they're zombies in a mall is a, is a very narrow market.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
There's just not room for both.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
Yeah, yeah.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
Well, the lawsuit states, quote, in both that the recreational activities of the zombies

57:17.000 --> 57:24.000
and absurdly grotesque kill scenes provide unexpected comedy, comedic relief.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Nice.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
Um, but yeah, I know I kind of agree.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
I kind of agree with what most of the people in chat are saying is that they're zombies

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
and they're in a mall.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
That's it.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I mean, the characters aren't the same.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
The plot's not really the same.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
It's just zombies in a mall.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
And how they become zombies aren't even the same.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Okay.

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
Here's my other thought is that, um, if Capcom hadn't put that thing on the box that says

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
it had nothing to do with Dawn of the Dead, do you think they would have gotten sued in

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
the first place?

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
Yeah.

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
Because my thing is that by putting that thing on there, it's almost like they admit, yeah,

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
there's a similarity here.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
No.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
But we, we don't intend it.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
I don't know.

58:03.000 --> 58:09.000
I think there was, you know, because then they could claim that, you know, they were

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
trying to trick the consumer into thinking it was a Dawn of the Dead type thing.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
But this is just them kind of trying to, they were trying to be preventative about it and

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
cover their ass saying, no, this is not what it is.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
Do they use lawn mowers in Dawn of the Dead?

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
Here, here's my other thing is that, I mean, if somebody buys Dead Rising, are they not

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
going to buy Dawn of the Dead?

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
You know, is that because, you know, to sort of claim that there's some type of like, you

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
know, oh, my rights have been abated and all this, you have to kind of claim that there's

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
financial losses going on.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
And my kind of whole thing is that the type of people who play Dead Rising exactly would

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
go out and buy Dawn of the Dead.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
So it's not like one's hurting the other.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
You know what I mean?

58:49.000 --> 58:55.000
SSJ 100 Matt says, why can't they make something original like zombies eating someone's neighbors?

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Oh, wait.

58:56.000 --> 59:01.000
Well, the next game supposedly wasn't going to be like, you know, in a mall and stuff.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
It was just going to be some other zombies on a plane.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
No, not zombies on a plane.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Zombies on the train.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Zombies on the moon.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
Yes, exactly.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Zombies on the moon.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Yeah.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
All right.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Well, anyway, this whole Sue happy world we live in just makes me angsty and people just

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
need to get over themselves.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
So I think we need to do the F.U. of the week.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
My F.U. of the week.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
It's a big F.U. towards drama and death.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Yeah.

59:23.000 --> 59:52.000
And tragedy.

59:52.000 --> 59:59.000
I think F.U. to the crap they're going to do and the sources of said crap.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Unfortunately.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Is that it?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Okay.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
That was a pretty heavy F.U. though, so not that I'm wanting there to be more, but.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
All right.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Logie.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
F.U. to Microsoft and, you know, kind of a little bit of rant.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I'm sure everybody's heard about the digital rights management, how it's all fucked up,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
where you have a console that's basically three rings on you and content you purchased

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
on there now you can no longer use on your new console unless you're logged in live.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
It's really retarded that they do that in the first place.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I've had that problem because, of course, I have a new console, even though I fixed

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
my own console.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It's funny.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
It still doesn't work on my old console now either.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I don't know.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It's all fucked up right now.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
My thing is, why isn't there a bit of lawsuit over that?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
That's something actually legitimate that they can have a lawsuit over instead of, you

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
know, complaining about live outages or, you know, the three rings of death or whatever.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I think that they should sue them over the digital rights management and stuff because

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
if you bought content online and now you can't use it because your system broke because

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
they're faulty and Microsoft isn't doing anything about it.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Absolutely nothing.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
There's countless stories on the Internet about this stuff.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
So why isn't anyone suing them over that?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
That's why I want to ask.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I just want to give an F.U. to the antibiotic I'm on this week.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I can't remember the name of it.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It's like Leviquim or Leptixim or I don't know what it's called.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Some antibiotic a doctor gave me.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
A, it's a brand name drug so I have to pay more for it because they don't make it generic

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
of it.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And B, it's the slowest antibiotic I've ever had.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I'm allergic to penicillin so also F.U. to the fact that I'm allergic to penicillin because

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
then I can just take that and I'd be better in no time.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
But the antibiotic I'm on now is the slowest one I've ever taken and it was more expensive

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
than C.Pro or any of the other ones I've taken before that are just fine.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And I know you're not supposed to take the same antibiotic because then you build up

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
an antibiotic blah blah blah.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah, we just now have an insurance-resistant bacteria.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Is that it?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Leptixim?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Is that it?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I don't know what the hell it's called.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I can't remember.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So F.U. to my slow antibiotics.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And that's all my F.Us of the week.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Now you can go, Jamie.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Okay.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Well, I love Sega.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I mean, if you don't love Sega, you probably have something wrong with your head.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So, um, this is good news for people is that Sega Superstars Tennis will be a week early.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It was supposed to be on March 20th and it's going to be out a week before that.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So you have minigames and basically it's Virtua Tennis.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It has achievements on Xbox 360 that are named after older Sega games.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And you can play as a bunch of the Sega feet.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Cool.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
You know, actually, it's kind of interesting.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Nolan Bushnell, you might remember him for making the game Pong, among other things.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And he is now working on an MMO-based title.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
No real clear answer on what exactly he's working on.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.000
They're going to be competing, obviously, with World of Warcraft.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It's unavoidable that the social and massively multiplayer games have become important.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Basically, I don't know, very vague on what he's working on.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
So, new multiplayer game, cool.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
What it is, no idea.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Didn't he, like, retire from the industry or something?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And he opened up his restaurant.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Nolan Bushnell brought a pizza hand here.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Which was Chuck E. Cheese.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And so did I.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Interesting.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
He was off the topic and he had stolen the right thing.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
They joke, though, in the article that it's massively multiplayer online Pong.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I doubt that.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
That would be pretty awesome.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I don't think that would be possible.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So, the drug is called Levaquin.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I looked it up.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And I just realized it's non-formulary.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
That's why I pay it so much.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
So I see my doctor kind of prescribing me something that doesn't pay too much money for it.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Sorry, I just didn't get that out there.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Who cares about Pong guys and MMOs?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Oh, that Chuck E. Cheese is kind of awesome.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Have you been to a Chuck E. Cheese lately?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They're really horrible now.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Decent salad bar, though.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000
But, you know, when I was little, I had a Chuck E. Cheese that was massive.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
We had a big theater room.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
It was this room that looked like a foyer to the bathroom that had glowing walls and shit.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
It had hands and feet on the walls that would clap.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And it had a party room with hippopotamus chicken.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Have you ever been to Bullwinkle's in the Bay Area?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
No.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
It's like the old school Chuck E. Cheese.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
At least, I hope it still is.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Last time I was there, which was a long time ago, it still was.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And these were when Chuck E. Cheese was starting to do the new super neon edgy Chuck E. Cheese shit.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It was still like the 1980s Chuck E. Cheese Bullwinkle.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
But they have a little section where you can sit down.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And they have almost like one of those mini Vegas water show things where they have the fountain doing a little choreography and stuff like that.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Awesome.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
That's pretty cool.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I don't know how big Bullwinkle's of a chain they are, but, you know, I guess Rocky and Bullwinkle aren't that popular.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I kind of want to go check it out now.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
That'd be pretty cool.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Let me see if they're still even open.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Of course, there's always John's incredibly shitty pizza.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
You know what? I like some of his pizza.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
No, I know. It's a funny name. It's not a bad place.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But I really like having rice inside of a place.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
That is pretty fun.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Anyhow, one thing I like seeing inside a place is Street Fighter IV.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Unfortunately, I haven't seen any yet.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
But if you live in some places, they have been popping up.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And over at Wired.com, they did a pretty lengthy piece on Street Fighter IV's nostalgic allure, is what they called it.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:19.000
But one interesting portion of it talked about that there is a possibility if and when there's console versions,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
possibly that some other characters may come in.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
You don't say bonus characters and console versions.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
We haven't seen that before.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
But who they name is very interesting.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Sakura could come over from Street Fighter Alpha or Ibuki from Street Fighter III.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So that would be kind of interesting.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Why not both?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Why not both?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Or do the old one on the Xbox, one on the PlayStation 3. That's always fun.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I miss the old times unlock stuff.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I thought that was cool.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Because when I told the story before, I used to work for an AMCO arcade.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And when we had Tekken 3, that would be like, who's next?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And have an outline of them.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Because I was keeping up with the overseas releases.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I would come back and tell my boss who is next.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And I found that they switched the order for the US version.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Interesting.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
So it was pretty funny.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I hope that if they're going to have release characters in this, they do something like that.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
So you sort of have to guess who it is or anticipate something that would add a little bit more excitement to it.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
You know what I mean?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Well, some new characters are already being spotted in Street Fighter IV arcade machines that are out there in the wild in the testing regions.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And Sagat and Balrog have now shown up in the game to only add bosses like old school Street Fighter II who cannot select them on the main select screen.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
So, kind of interesting.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And by Balrog, it's who we had in Vega over here.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I'm not sure because I believe it is Boxer Balrog.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Because one of these machines I believe is in North America and that's one of the games that's in Street Fighter IV.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And Sagat?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Yeah.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I was looking at the little video.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
No, if you're right, it's the US version.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So unfortunately, the link will just close down apparently.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:12.000
It got converted into a night club called the Backbeat in late 1990s and it was closed in the mid 2000s.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It was in Santa Clara, California.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Animatronic animals are not really high-end of animals.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
There are some restaurants outside of California.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:37.000
There's one in Wilsonville, Oregon, Cary, North Carolina, Richmond, Virginia, Miamiburg, Ohio, and early North Carolina.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Hey, it was a cool place.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
It was pretty awesome.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
They had a ton of cool stuff there.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Also, just want to say really quickly, all those screenshots you can see in Street Fighter IV, they all seem like they're in that upgraded version of the Chun-Li phase.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So there are some of the battle locations out there.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Here's what's showing up.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000
A drive-in at night, a beautiful day in South Asia, and an inland jungle in South America.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
So some more battle regions are showing up.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I was looking at the movie that's up.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
It's the Sagat versus UNDF and just watching how fluid it is.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
It's really cute.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000
It really looks like it's captured a lot of the old feel of the older games.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I'm excited.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I'll definitely be checking this out when it comes out.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Arcade and console.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Now please let me know that I'm not at all excited about.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
What's that?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
It's Road Rash.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Because I hate Road Rash.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
But my husband loves Road Rash.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:50.000
So there has been a little bit let out that the Electronic Arts CEO is talking about doing another Road Rash, which is basically a game where your own motorcycles beat each other up.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Like we had that scene in Final Fantasy VII, where you go and beat people up.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Yeah, get in a Road Rash.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I remember that.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So someone actually let a few things slip about it coming out.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And that was actually in Road Sebastian Box.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:19.000
At a classic metal show, he said that one of his recent songs is going to be in...

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And to quote Ashley said, it's a super heavy song.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
It just got picked up for some video game.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Road Rage or Road Rash or something like that.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Dude, who would have thought that a big scoop in gaming would have come from Sebastian Bach?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:42.000
And EA actually said that Road Rash is not currently in development.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But Road Rage, that's a whole different story.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Sebastian Bach is posturing me because he was rich.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
He did do a good rest.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Probably not deep.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And actually, it also is coming to the PlayStation Store as well.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
It's from Capcom.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
And it looks like it's going to be available for 800 Microsoft points or $10

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
or just $10 of real money on the PlayStation Network.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I haven't heard too much about this game.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It doesn't look that great.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
But I don't know.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Tread them, at least.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
All right.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
This story is so cruel.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I don't know.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I feel like these parents, there's going to be a special place in hell for them.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
But apparently, here's what's happened.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
There's this YouTube floating around.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And there's this kid who got so excited because on Christmas Day,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000
he opened up his presents under the tree and he got an Xbox 360.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
But unfortunately, here's what happened.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
The Xbox 360 just was a box that was stuffed with clothes.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
So the kid got clothes in an Xbox 360 box.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Yes, there is video.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
This is so cruel.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I actually haven't even watched it.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
He's all excited.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It makes you want to cry.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Poor kid.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
He opens up the thing.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
He's like, oh, my God.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Xbox 360.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Hell, yeah.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Of course, I love you anyways, though.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Oh, I'm going to open it up.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
He's so excited.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Are you serious?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.000
This is so wrong.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I forget which blog, but they suggested a pile of parenting books shaped like a car.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
And they're all laughing.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
And the parents are laughing at the kid.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And we wonder why our kids end up so screwed up in school.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
That's fucked up.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
But it is very fucked up.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I don't know if you've heard about the news on this.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
In Gadget, they've offered to find the kid and they're going to give him a real life box 360.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
If he gets emancipated.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I threw the last part in there, but seriously.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
That's fucked up.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
This kid's going to be in the news later on after playing the Xbox 360.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Later on, he's going to kill his parents in the middle of the night because, you know, they're fucked up.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And she's like, oh, I can't afford an Xbox 360.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Yet you're an asshole enough to go out there and find an empty Xbox 360 box to fill clothes with.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
And they put it on the internet.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Oh, that's just fucked up.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Ag Def says, man, those parents are douches.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Frisbee says, look at me, I'm a big man, I can laugh at my own kid.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Ha ha ha ha.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Jamie, you're being awfully quiet.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I know you got a comment.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
What do you think?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Disgusting.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Yeah.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I don't think there's anything at all funny about it.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
That's just really disgusting.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000
This is why we have kids that are just like, go to school and be done shit.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
You know?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Because their parents teach it to them.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I mean, what's a kid gonna think?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Seriously, my parents are assholes, that's what you're gonna think.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I mean, unless they just punked him with this and then like, you know, gave him the Xbox, you know, afterwards.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
You know, like pretend to always can't afford it.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.000
That's what I'm wondering is that maybe there's a second half where he actually got the Xbox later that none of us are seeing, but I don't know.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I doubt it.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Still.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Still.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
All right.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.000
So that's all I have to say on that story.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Well, that's just, I mean, I really am absolutely disgusted by that.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I mean, really disgusted by that.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Anyway, in happier moods, I should say.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Penny Arcade is, they announced that Penny Arcade Xbox X is going to be August 21st, 2008 with the DigiPen Institute of Technology.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:20.000
So they're looking for ten independent developers that are being viewed by attendees and media and publishers.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And there's actually a panel of 50, I guess, industry top people who will be selecting the ten submissions they consider going to be the best based on gameplay and fun factor.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And there's also going to be one that the audience gets to vote on.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
An Audience Choice Award.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
That's kind of a neat idea.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I like the whole idea of bringing some independent stuff to the forefront.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
It's pretty nice.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Yeah.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Props to these folks.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
I would love to go to Penny Arcade Expo someday.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Maybe this will be my year.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Who knows?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
We'll see.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I'll try.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
All right.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
We're going to open up the Skype line very soon.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
But first, one more story.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I know this story is going to come as a shock to people.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
If it's seriously breaking news, folks, you're going to want to listen in.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
There's been a study.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:33.000
A study has been done that shows men like video games.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Shocking, I know.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
You don't say.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Absolutely shocking.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000
There's been a study, research that has been done by Frank N.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Looks like a legit associate.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I thought men like fixed cars and went to baseball games and that's what men did.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I always thought video games were like a female thing.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Didn't Oprah bring video games on her show and stuff?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I don't know.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Interesting.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:16.000
It says, you know, apparently the study of 1,864 Americans showed that among males, overall

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
console gaming came in third behind using the internet and watching TV.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I might have the internet and TV for both watching porn.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Among males 12 to 34, console gaming came in first and then dropped dramatically in

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
older demographics.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I've been playing games until I die.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000
The research shows women overall would rather talk on the phone, watch the DVD, listen to

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
music or read a book before playing console games.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Oh, no.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.000
There is an odd spike among 18 to 24-year-old females for console gaming.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Three web-based games did better with females, particularly among women of mature age.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
No real shocking revelations, of course.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Act-deaf-con-chat says, LOL stereotypes.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
It makes me want to go play some fucking Half-Life.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Son-of-tat says, where was masturbation on the list?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
That must have been number four.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
No, that just is included with all the topics.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Yeah, you have to understand, they do everything alphabetically, so it's mad and then masturbation.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Janai says, read a book, read a book.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
It's almost like reading a book.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I'm thinking that there's probably a lot of women out there who like video games, too,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
and I think there's also a lot of men who don't like video games.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I know that might be a shock to some people.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
His name is Skype.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Orange Mountain Radio.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
But first, we have some voicemails to catch up on.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Sometimes when we're not live, some of the folks who like to listen to our podcasts and

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
so on, they like to leave us voicemails.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
So, we want to get some of those out of the way real quick, so I'm going to start with this one.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Hi, guys.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I don't have a screening on your forum, but I'm known as Bezineater on the PlayStation Network,

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000
and I'm also known as De'arra on Final Fantasy XI.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I just want to say to you guys, that's a great show.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I test it every week, and I think it has a couple of questions to you.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:33.000
First of all, if you're going to see any kind of rumors, it's equal to Final Fantasy XI,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.000
and if you provide any details, if you know any.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:26.380
Secondly, I heard that

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
survival is a really great game and whatnot.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
We have something like 20 million players, give or take.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
But the thing is, though, I want to play it, but I don't have PC.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Is there any sense in how that he'll be coming to consoles anytime soon,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
specifically PlayStation 3?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:14.000
If he does, it'll be great, because right now my button-ups and my modes are really limited.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Any insights you guys have would be great. Thank you.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Thank you very much for the voicemail.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I'm thinking that where you're getting the impression that developers are working on the sequel

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000
is because it has come out that the people behind Final Fantasy XI, that team, is working on another MMO,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
but it hasn't been said what it is they're working on.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I think a lot of people are assuming it's Final Fantasy XI too,

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
but I honestly think if they are going to make another MMO,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
it's not going to be Final Fantasy XIV or any of that.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000
They may make a new MMO with some of the same concepts, but I don't know.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Would it sell as well without a Final Fantasy name? I don't know.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
A Kingdom Hearts MMO? Maybe. Who knows.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
But there's nothing out there concrete at this time.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000
You can probably bet that they'll try to crank at least one more expansion out of Final Fantasy XI before it's done.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I know some people said this last one that came out, the...

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000
the Prime one, not Precious of Honor again, but the one that just came out. Why can't I remember the name?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Williams of the Goddess?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Thank you very much. Williams of the Goddess.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
A lot of people said this in the last one. I don't know.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I think if they did like 12 expansions forever, but I think they could get at least one more out of this, I think.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
At least to hold the Final Fantasy XI fans over until the real sequel comes out, but I don't know.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Nothing concrete isn't said. Anything you hear out there is speculation alone.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
One more voice mail for you guys.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I miss you guys. It was a plus.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Oh, and here's what I did on Sunday since I couldn't listen.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I... I had an equation set up at the clock and I said it was eight my time.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:28.000
So I threw a random episode in my playlist and listened to it like I was listening to it.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I... I can't really recall the episode number up here, but it was fucking hilarious.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I'm thinking he has the reverse cage match in it.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
This show's never coming.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I'm sure many of you know what it is.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I'm kind of paranoid that somebody's going to jack my computer while I'm not looking.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.000
So I'm going to go ahead and say bye and with luck I should see you all on Sunday. Bye!

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Couple comments from chat. Rama says,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Sounds like she's walking and talking. I kind of agree.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Sj100matt says, Is Misty the first PSP Sky caller? I believe she is.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I was trying to be number one, but I had the wrong...

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
You got beat!

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
No, that's definitely one reason I wanted to play that is because that would be the first PSP call we've gotten.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
So there you have it.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Unless she was lying.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
No, I don't think she's lying.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Because it came through with her name. She definitely made that call on Skype.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And from the way it sounded, she was definitely outdoors. She was not by a computer.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
That was pretty bad quality for her.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yeah, it wasn't bad quality for a call.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
A. I think it's cute she was nerdy. I love it when people get nervous and they don't know what to say.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Because I'm like, we're just dumb kids like all the rest of you, so I don't know why.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
But I guess sometimes it's hard when you're not getting the feedback.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Or at least our live callers get that live feedback where we can kind of tell them.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
But yeah, I think that's really neat that she puts on the old episodes.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
We do need to release more of the old episodes.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
One of those projects I'll never get to.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Anyhow, let's open up the Skypline for all y'all.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
It's now wide open for everybody to call in.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
username on Skype once again.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000
And after we do the Skypline tonight, we'll be getting some last minute phone calls.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Not last minute phone calls, last minute stories.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I've been doing this far too long.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Last minute stories you need?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Yeah.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Let's go ahead and take a call.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Legend of Dr.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I love Legend of Dr. What's on your mind?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Nah, just chillin' right here recovering from the heat that I got from clubbin' like a saint.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
But that's besides the point.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Just wanted to probably point out the whole clusterfuck that Nintendo has created as a result of their attempts to create an online multiplayer.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
What is your thoughts on that?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
It's just bullshit, man. It's not bad.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I mean, it's bad enough when people like me have to wait in front of like 10, 20, 30 guys outside of Nintendo World every morning just to get the school week.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And then, you know, if you take it home, you realize that, you know, there's barely an online multiplayer experience to begin with.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
But what about the children, Daku? What about the children?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Well, that's playing through the Disney book. You know, the soccer mom book.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
But, you know...

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Who is buying Wii's, Daku? Soccer mom?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Of course. That's the demographic.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And they're playing the Disney card because, you know, think about what would happen, you know, if someone were to catch them off guard by trying to do something that allowed, you know, the other players to basically, you know, to curse in a magic standard like they do on Xbox Live.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
It would be a shit-toll.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
You know, Xbox News, for example, would just, you know, spin the shit out of the Wii image.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:06.000
The dark side of the Nintendo Wii, where these young children are being, their eyes are being raped by the hideous voice chat inside Mario Kart Wii.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
How do these raise your children tonight on Fox?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:21.000
If you're basically playing Mario Kart, you know, with voice chat or anything like that, you know, the only thing I'm worried about is ad-hoc.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And, you know, ad-hoc is just ruining the experience for everyone.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:37.000
But at the same time, you know, it's like, if you put the right security measures on it, like, you know, I am totally fine with Nintendo saying, no communication between strangers, period.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:47.000
But with the whole Franco thing, you know, I would think that, you know, once you have the Franco, then you should be able, if you want to say fucking shit, you should be able to do that.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Right, I mean, I don't know. I guess that kind of, you know, that kind of goes, you know, kind of basically takes away, if not, you know, goes in a different direction in terms of, you know, the typical matchmaking done on other places.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Yeah, I mean, yeah, that might be one thing, but I don't know if it'd be enough to throw the fuse or something.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Okay, quick question, Zach, and quick question, then we gotta wrap up.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:24.000
G.S. 68 says, and he's quoting something he said earlier in chat, he said, you say the Xbox Live, they say, you know, N-I-G, blah, blah, blah, F-A, blah, blah, blah, and all that they say on Xbox Live, yet you bitch about Nintendo's online.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.000
So, what's the answer? Because Xbox is too much, Nintendo is not enough. What's the answer?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I don't know, I mean, look, think about it. I mean, you can mute, in Xbox Live, I know you can mute people, right, and even though Nintendo is basically doing the mute for you, you don't even have that option to sign with other, like, rude, obnoxious players.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I mean, it's just basically, it's boiled down to a Disney-type level, where it's just, you know, this is what you can't, you know, these are the phrases you can't, you know, you can't say, and they just, you know, they can only work.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Okay, here's my last question for you, Zachu. As much as you or I may hate to admit it, is this change, is this revelation about the online thing and Mario Kart online, is it gonna affect sales?

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I doubt it. I mean, most people, I mean, you know, most people won't leave it, and I doubt that many people even take advantage of all, you know, the online features anyways.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:33.000
I mean, some will, but I think of Mario Kart as something you would share amongst friends, you know, with food and liquor and stuff like that.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And it's not just a social video game conference, that's, you know, that's ahead of the fields of your audience and the 360 and PS3 combined.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Right. I think you are right, Zachu. I don't think it's gonna affect sales at all. We gotta let you go, Zachu. Thank you so much for the call. Good to hear from you.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I hope you heard the bonus statement tonight, by the way. There was some very exciting news for you in there.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:04.000
1-877-GAMEL, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Hi, this is Act Deaf in Chat.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Hi, Act Deaf in Chat. How are you? What's on your mind, buddy?

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Just talking about, everyone talk about the thing you talked about in the bonus segment about the March Madness, the DMN is urbanizing?

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Yes, and just so our podcast listeners know, since they don't always get to hear the bonus statement, because we do something bonus.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:34.000
DMN, one of our weeknight shows, I believe there's a show on Wednesdays, The Insanest Hour, he is putting together the top 64.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:40.000
He's doing this March Madness thing with the 64 games, going face-off against each other, all the listeners submitted in their list.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
And during the bonus segment tonight, the hosts voted on their favorite.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So that being said, I just want to get some background there, Act Deaf. What did you want to say on that?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:59.000
You and Loki made a vote for one of the brackets. It was Ocarina of Time and Derby Superstar.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Yes.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I want to say that I'm with you. So not for the same reason, but just because I do think that Derby Superstar is a better game than Ocarina of Time.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Yeah, here's the thing. Loki and I made a controversial vote during the bonus segment and this whole thing.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:27.000
We voted for Kirby Superstar over Ocarina of Time, and both of us said it's because basically we both agree that Ocarina of Time is one of the most, by the gaming community in general, overrated games there is.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I've tried playing it and I can't stand it.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
When Zelda wins 3D for me, it just didn't work.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Even Wind Waker, or not Wind Waker. Wind Waker is fine. I like Wind Waker and I like Zelda for the DS.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
But I don't like, you know...

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
It's not that I think it's a bad game.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I don't care for the more mature looking Link. I don't like the 3D ones that are on Nintendo 64 and I didn't really get into...

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And I just love the Super Nintendo ones so, so much. It's one of my favorite games of all time. Seriously.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Maybe it's not solid talking but for me Kirby Superstar is the better game there because Kirby Superstar is like many games in one. Many adventure games, also multiplayer games.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:34.000
And basically, although the story in it, or many stories in it, aren't as deep as Ocarina of Time, so you can have a better time playing it.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:40.000
And even replaying it, like Great Table Planet is one of the games there.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.000
It's basically an adventure game that you find treasures.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:56.000
I think there's like 100 treasures you have to find and it's very difficult to do it in one simple run. You have to replay it again and again to get there.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Act out, but maybe you just want to admit that maybe a little bit you're just a Kirby fanboy.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Maybe. So, I do like Ocarina of Time and maybe it's one of my favorite games of all time but...

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I just want to make that point that maybe Ocarina of Time is not that great of a game.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It's not all that in a bag of chips.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I'm sure there's many people out there that disagree, but you know what? That's the reason I love doing this show is because everybody has a different opinion.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And we have ours and I'm sure many of you have been asked in emails we did this week about how we hate Ocarina of Time. It isn't true. We like it.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Yeah, different strokes for different people.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Exactly. If you want to put it that way, then fine.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Alright, Act out any other comments you have for our listeners tonight.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I want to say that I already got my ticket for video games live, so in two weeks I'm going to see it.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Will we expect a full report?

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
You will.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Alright, sounds good. Take care Act out, have fun with video games live. We don't talk to you before that.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Same.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:06.000
If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call. 877-GAMELAR.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
The call's coming back to back tonight. Hi, Aaron. Who's this?

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Hey, hey, it's Ronald.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Wow, you got through. What do you own in Zaku and Raven's Dolphin? What is it that you guys have to get you in the chat before anybody else?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
A fast trigger finger.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I guess so. You guys are good. Alright, well what's on your mind, Ronald?

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Well, a couple of things about the whole of Nintendo online thing. Well, I don't blame them for setting up the preset text chat and all that, but when friends get together and play, it is the most rowdy-ness ever.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I mean, really, if I'm going to play Mario Kart Wii online with my friends, I'm left to curse like a sailor. I want to say this, I want to say that.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Me too.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Yes, I would.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Me too. The weird thing is that thanks to technology, I'm still going to do that, whether it be this whole Ventrilo thing or the, I love the idea of, I think it was even Loki or Chatter that said it.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.000
You sign on to the Xbox 360 and do your chat on the 360 and then play the Wii.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Well, for me, I'll just bring my laptop next to the Wii and I'll just put my headset on and just like, everyone goes back there. Let's just go, you know?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Do you think maybe that's it? Do you think Nintendo maybe knows that, you know what, those people don't fucking care. They're all about, you know, coddling the family to make sure.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I'm just trying to be double-degged.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I think it tends to be on the fact that they're a quote-unquote family company, family gaming console and stuff like that, you know?

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
They're scared shitless about online is what it is.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.000
It's pretty genuine chat, but it's more fun when it's multiplayer offline.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Honestly, when I get Mario Kart Wii, I'm going to be too busy hosting racing parties at my house and trying to get my Wii online and sit in a lobby, call my friends and get into the chat room and to the lobby where we can all play together.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.000
You know what though, I gotta say though, Janine, sometimes that's not an option though.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:16.000
You know, one of the beautiful things about the internet is that it brings you together. One reason I'm so obsessed with WoW to the point you guys make fun of me over it is that I get to play with some of my friends I don't see on a regular basis.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:23.000
For instance, one of my closest friends lives in Kansas, so we play that way and we also have a guy in our guild who's from Idaho who's hilarious.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And yeah, there's a bunch of local people on there too, but we have a good time, you know, just laughing and playing the game and all that.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:41.000
You know, a lot of our listeners, you know, we get to play games on DS sometimes, I get to play with people in New York City and all that stuff. So, you know, sometimes the internet really helps fill in that void and you can't have people on the couch.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000
True, true.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Alright, any other thoughts, Rambo, before I let you go?

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Yeah, a couple of things, but number one, remember when you said earlier about a Hello Kitty PlayStation 3?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Yes.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I thought you had a thing for Batch Maroon.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:04.000
It is the Batch Maroon thing, not a Hello Kitty thing, but I've just accepted the fact that people are just going to loop it all in the same thing and when I say Batch Maroon is Sanrio, they're going to go, oh, you like Hello Kitty.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Plus there's the whole fact that I have the toaster and the coffee maker, which doesn't help.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:16.000
They don't make, like, if they came out with a Batch Maroon toaster, I would sell that thing, my Hello Kitty wanted to garage sale so quick and replace it, but they just, they don't do it.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
No love for penguins.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:25.000
So does my sister, they had the Hello Kitty AR-15 that came back.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
You know, I was surprised no one got me the waffle maker for Christmas.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.000
So many people said they were going to give me the waffle maker, but it was one of those things where I think no one wanted to buy it because they all thought everyone else was getting it.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Which is funny.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:51.000
And before I go, when I went to chapter five a couple of weeks ago, a couple of interesting things. Number one, in the game room, they had a 32 inch HDTV set up, went to the Atari 7800, playing Mario Brothers.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:37:04.000
That's fucking hardcore. You know, I have to admit, I have to admit, when I was at the record store this weekend that also sells the old games, and I saw some of the games that they had on the 2600, like combat and warlords and all that stuff.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And I was like, man, how fun would it be just for one day to hook up the Atari 2600 games to the TV, the big HDTV, and just have a brawl.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Brawl.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
What?

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Come over.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
We'll hook up the 5200.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Let's just TV that shit.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I want to actually have the 5200 hooked up because even though the controllers broke really easily, I would totally love to get like a Kix game going on.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Oh, good times.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I want some epic Kaboom.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Actually, not a game, I really love.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I want some HD Kaboom.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I love kangaroo.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
We need to do that one weekend.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
And leave us.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I think one weekend, we need to just marathon the shit out of old school Atari games.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Why don't we do this? How about twice a month, or you know, we can manage the time.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000
We pick an old console, hook that shit up and play it.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
You're talking old console, or you're talking twice a month.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
You're talking about my, you know, vault in my house.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Yeah, I know.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
It does need to get played.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
It does.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I think we can do it for click-a-vision and television.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Let's make it happen. Let's not let this go the way the Super Metroid thinks.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
We set a time, we set a date, and we do it.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I bring it over to Justin's TV cam so the chatters can enjoy it too.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
We'll point it at the TV and just go to town.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Let's do it.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Let's do it. When?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Okay, we can't set a time right now because we have to consult our calendars, but Rama, you're in charge of bitching at us until it happens.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Well, this isn't early April.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
All right.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
We will do.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
We have to wait that long?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Well, because I'm not able to do with content.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Oh, that's right.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And I'm getting shot in the head next, not just right at the neck.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000
All right, so Rama, you stay on our asses until it happens, all right?

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
That's what I will do.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
All right.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
We gotta let you go, Rama.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
All right, most of our game is in the game room.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
My match club is Brawl.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Out of all the hot games, everybody was online from Brawl.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
All my best friends came and were screaming.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Oh, my God.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Brawl was so good.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
It was so good.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I'm like, dude, relax.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Over your room.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Change your underwear.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Go back to play, okay?

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Relax.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
The line was like going all over the place.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Yes, you had data.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Everybody was there to play Brawl.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
This game isn't clear.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
At least 500 copies per se.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
But you know what?

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000
You were looking at Brawl's target audience at that place, you know what I mean?

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Of course, all the people that go to anime concerts are excited about Brawl.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Most of them are Nintendo fanboys.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000
But still, I mean, you have people my age going, let's go to the forest.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
It's gonna be huge, stellar.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I'm not doubting you on that, Rama.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
It's gonna be huge, stellar.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
We gotta let you go.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
This call's going on for very, very long.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
But thank you so much, as always.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Take care, everybody.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Sorry.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
This is getting to seven minutes.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I'm trying to keep them at four minutes now.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
One more call.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
We're wrapping up.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Let's see.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
How far are we in the show?

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I think we gotta wrap up.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
That's just part B.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Cause the bonus there.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Bonus statement tonight was 15 minutes.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
It's 9.30 here.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
We gotta end this shit.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
So, that being said, quickly, Loki, any last minute stories?

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Yes.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I have last minute stories for you.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Alright.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Okay.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Lego MMO.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
We know and love that they have coming out.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
What's cool about it is if you build stuff in the game, you can actually hit a button,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
much like you can in Spore, and they will spit out a kit that will actually be shipped

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
to your house where you can build stuff in the game.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:23.000
That's pretty awesome.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Wow.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
That's kinda neat.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
You don't know Jack has become part of Yahoo Games.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Oh, I'm so sad that missed the cut tonight.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
That is very exciting news.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I'm very excited about that.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Is it up now?

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Can you play it?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Yes, it is up now.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Shut up.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I don't know what I'm doing tonight.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I'm not sure.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Resident Evil Zero is coming to the Wii in Japan to support the GameCube thing and much

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
like...

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Yeah.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Anyway.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.240
A Finnish company, or Finnish stopper company, called FutureMark Game Studio has filed papers

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.240
to trademark pwnage.

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:06.000
Yes, they're trying to trademark pwnage.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Was they gonna put it on shirts and stuff?

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I don't know why.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Interesting.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Let's see.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Then, the PlayStation Store is apparently gonna be overhauled in April.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:23.000
It's gonna look more like the Things Store, which, you know, a little different, a little

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
bit easier to navigate.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So that's kinda cool.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
So we'll get for that in April there.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
And this will be Arcade Stage 4 is headed to PS3.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
That's pretty cool.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Wow.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
This is not a game I'm gonna be importing, though.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I learned my lesson the first time.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Did the other Initial D games come out on console?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I don't think they ever did.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
They're not here.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Even here.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
And they have Initial D on the PSP as well.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Strange.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
And lastly...

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I have a PS3 one.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Hmm.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Lastly, to piss off people even more, a guy named Vandal had an Xbox 360 which he had

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.000
signed by team members from the budget staff, Xbox 360 team members.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
There's even a sketch of Spartans done by the Rooster Teeth guy.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Anyways, his 360 died and had the free ring, so he sent it in to get sick.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
He even, you know, took precautions of asking them, hey, you know, can you send this back

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000
to me in the same case?

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
If not, you know, can you make sure you put the new case on the new system?

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
That kind of stuff.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Well, he gets it back.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Serial numbers match and everything, but they rubbed off the Sharpie, you know, drawing

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
was on the case.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
It's not a new case.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
It's actually the old case and they literally rubbed it off.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000
You can see parts where the Sharpie marker is still there.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Somebody didn't get the memo.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Why would they do that in the first place?

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Why would you rub something off?

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I mean, that's just being a dick is what that is.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
And no one else that didn't make a cut.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:00.000
The singing store is also going to be getting 67 songs in the next update, which I believe

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
is supposed to happen in April as well.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000
The only problem is those 67 songs weren't all the other King Star games, so it's nothing

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
new.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Alright, well, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
George Parker, we'll start with you tonight.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Your final thoughts.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Tired.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
My final thought is wine is good.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Plum wine was good.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
What's your final thought?

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
My final thought is I'm still working on that 360.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
It's still being a seller.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Alright, well, after our amazing February of fail, we hope March has been a good month

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
to you guys so far.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
I think it was a good show tonight.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I do think it was a good show tonight.
