0	15000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 2nd of 2008, where we're taping episode number 269 of Orange Lounge Radio live, as we do here every Sunday night, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
15000	23000	In Part A, you missed a whole bunch of Sony news. We talked about Metal Gear Solid 4, some of the new bundles that are coming out, the departure of Phil Harrison, just a lot of that.
23000	40000	Now we're going to get into some Nintendo news in this segment. Yes, Logan? Yes. Now, of course, like most things, Nintendo hasn't made an official announcement on the Mario Kart Wii Date, but that doesn't mean that retailers haven't figured out when it's coming out.
40000	59000	Including such wonderful websites as GameFly, GameStop, Circuit City, and I think a few others, have it listed as April 27th, that's two days before Grand Theft Auto 4, and that would also be a Sunday.
59000	82000	Is this going to happen or not? Who knows? Do you think they're doing that to specifically get the jump on Grand Theft Auto 4, or is it kind of one of those, ah, I think they're going to be out of, you know, they need to press them, they need to have enough time to press those discs.
82000	98000	And also, the other thing that's really going to hamper that game is the production of those two fucking wheels. It's absolutely retarded, but if you were a betting man, 27 would be a very good bet.
98000	112000	Very good odds on that bet, alright. You know, maybe one thing that the game has been, because it was originally supposed to come out late last year, right? Wasn't it originally a Christmas release that got pushed back a little bit? Something like that, our first quarter, I don't know.
112000	123000	Well, anyhow, perhaps one reason they pushed it back is because, guess what guys, Mario Kart Wii, it looks like Nintendo has finally caught on, Mario Kart Wii is going to have online chat in it.
123000	135000	It's about time, I mean, Xbox has been doing this for years, right? Oh, I see. Mario Kart Wii will be supporting online text chat.
135000	146000	That's right, you'll be able to send text messages to your friends over Mario Kart Wii, provided that they are on your friends list, you have their friend codes and all that stuff, you will be able to text.
146000	155000	And you can do it before matches, it's assumed you can do it after matches. Not quite. Well, how does that work?
155000	169000	You see, it's not like you would think at an IRC chat room or something like that. You can send them little pre-determined messages, like, I'm sad, or good game, and stuff like that.
169000	172000	Oh my god, for real? For real.
172000	179000	Yeah, it's not, like, as cool as you would think. Is there a way, I think, of trying to control the game right now?
179000	189000	It's like the Disney MMO, I'm sorry, the news must have changed slightly since the initial release that I jammed in or whatever, so okay, so now it's been, it's like the Disney MMOs.
189000	194000	Like, if you've ever played, what is that, Toontown, I think it is? You only have a list of pre-selected phrases you can use.
194000	205000	Yeah, that's the same shit. Yeah, you do not get to, um, actually chat in this, it's just little messages that you can send back and forth.
205000	214000	Yay, hooray, you know, even though there's, you know, because god forbid we should, you know, shield our children from all sorts of filth out there, you know, all those people.
214000	221000	People on your damn friends list playing Mario Kart, oh my god. Sad, sad, sad.
221000	228000	RossdielUT says, I'm sorry, that's, I'm sorry, it's RansdielUT, their names are very similar tonight, I think that's Rama, another name.
228000	237000	Uh, RansdielUT says, text chat, better than hearing F, M, G, N, N, I, M, E, R, and all that stuff on Waffling, so.
237000	254000	Well, you know, I think that, in one respect, I think it's a good idea, you know, because they are trying to make an effort to protect their intended group, I should say.
254000	269000	You know, which was why, you know, probably just needed the same thing with theirs, they don't want their, something with their name on it, for lack of a better description, to buy the people playing it, you know. So, in that way, I think it was smart.
269000	272000	It's just playing a weight stamp today, that's all it is.
272000	279000	Yeah, and RansdielUT continues in our chat room, chat.hollandjones.com, but if you're playing online with friends, you should be allowed to say whatever you want.
279000	290000	You know, I would like to see a mode where, you know, okay, yeah, maybe it's off by default, but maybe I can go in there and turn it on or something, where, you know, if I want to call my friends gay while I'm playing, I should have the right.
290000	296000	Here's a thought, I don't know, maybe filter the obscenities. Oh my god, that's so hard.
296000	309000	It's like, it's stupid is what it is. It's absolutely stupid that you just jump through all these hoops to just frickin' play the game with your friends, and then after all that stuff, why even include text chat?
309000	311000	You know, basically, um.
311000	315000	So they can put a big sticker on the box, support online chat.
315000	327000	Yeah, I can do the report on this, and basically, uh, you know, selected, limited, select those automated statements and responses while playing the game. Like, hello, I'm sad, I'd say welcome, you know.
327000	333000	RansdielUT asks, and yes, this time it is RansdielUT asks in chat room, why even make the stupid game online?
333000	341000	Well, you know, for me, it's kind of like the DS game. I mean, how often do you go on a DS game and somebody is already there online waiting for you? That doesn't happen.
341000	346000	You pre-arrange those matches over the internet on AIM, or you pre-arrange them over the telephone.
346000	351000	So I'm thinking just fire up a Skype and voice chat.
351000	357000	Okay, here's another thought, and this is a kind of support Nintendo on this decision.
357000	362000	You remember back to Final Fantasy XI, they had predetermined text things that you could type in there.
362000	374000	Because this game is being released in alternate regions with a bunch of different languages, now there's no sort of language barrier between other people because, you know, it's in their native language no matter where you're sending this, uh, phrase to.
374000	377000	Much like I think there's the same thing Fantasy Star Online.
377000	378000	There's Final Fantasy XI?
378000	380000	Yeah, there's Final Fantasy XI, like I said.
380000	389000	So that's what this is, you know, supporting that feature, because this may be also the chat with the other people, not necessarily your friends that you're playing with as well.
389000	398000	I just wish they would also have normal chatting in there as well on top of this stuff, but whatever.
398000	409000	I'm looking at the JustinTV chat for a minute, and usually I don't take a chance to read it, but our old buddy AkumaJP is in there and says, uh, type while driving. Better.
409000	414000	As if talking on your cell phone while driving wasn't bad enough, now you can type while driving.
414000	418000	Hey, well it's supposed to be remote, you know, you really only need one hand to kind of do that.
418000	420000	Can I put on my makeup while I drive too?
420000	421000	Yeah.
421000	422000	Alright.
422000	427000	Oh my god, that'd be an awesome, like, Wii game or whatever you're driving, you have to use the Wii remote to put up makeup.
427000	432000	Woman driver of the game.
432000	434000	Our...
434000	436000	Okay, drag queen driver of that game.
436000	437000	Okay, that's better.
437000	440000	That has to be kind of hot.
440000	445000	You gotta put on your makeup and your stilettos while you're trying to drive.
445000	447000	Put on your furry costume on a Wii.
447000	448000	And change the radio.
448000	452000	Hey, Mr. DJ, sorry to yell, can we move on please?
452000	461000	Um, well, something that is actually fairly cool about Mario Kart Wii is that there is, um, an 8 finger bath mode.
461000	463000	Which is pretty cool.
463000	473000	So, um, it looks like you'll be able to, um, well, I think they're determining this more from a screenshot,
473000	483000	but it says that they have, uh, 8 people on, 8 icons, and, uh, lots of, uh, stuff on the path to throw at everybody else.
483000	487000	Can't wait for Mario Kart. I'm more excited about this game than Brawl.
487000	489000	Why is that?
489000	491000	Because I'm not really into the fighting games.
491000	496000	Mario Kart, I love Mario Kart. I bought every game system or every Nintendo system for Mario Kart.
496000	498000	Wait, even Double Dash?
498000	500000	Yes, I even bought Double Dash.
500000	502000	But did you like Double Dash?
502000	504000	It was okay.
504000	508000	The battle mode in Double Dash really sucks balls, but, you know.
508000	510000	Well, sorry, Jamie, but what do you think of, uh, ePlayer Battle Mode?
510000	513000	I mean, is that a game selling thing for you, or?
513000	521000	Well, I'll probably get into it anyway, but I think that that's fair and cool, especially since I know enough people who have a Wii to participate in that much play.
521000	523000	I just wish it would, you know.
523000	527000	I was thinking what you could do is have a laptop in with, uh, Ventrilo.
527000	529000	And maybe your snack coffee.
529000	538000	That's true. But, you know, I don't, like, for me, my computer is all the way out here in the dungeon, a.k.a. garage, a.k.a. O.L.R. Makeshift Studio.
538000	540000	And then the Wii is all the way in there.
540000	542000	So I can't really do that.
542000	545000	I'm just here for myself. I got my laptop. You got your MacBook?
545000	549000	Alright, I got this. This involves two different game systems over here.
549000	560000	Okay, what you can do is use your wireless communicator from your Xbox 360 and open a voice chat and that, and just not hook up the video to your TV and play the Wii online through your TV.
560000	565000	So you've got voice chat and you're playing Mario Kart.
565000	568000	Can you come over and hook that all up?
568000	571000	It's too many wires.
571000	575000	Maybe I can get the best of my people to install it for me.
575000	579000	If you don't want this to do, you're like, huh?
579000	582000	Did we cover that story? I think it got cut from the show.
582000	591000	At Best Buy, there was a sticker on an Xbox 360 game that said, have Geek Squad install this game on your Xbox 360.
591000	595000	I've seen that and I've made fun of it in the store. I'm like, seriously.
595000	599000	I always chalked it up to somebody got sicker happy and put stickers on the wrong thing.
599000	602000	That's special.
602000	608000	Eject, put the game in, drop it down, push the eject button again, game goes in.
608000	610000	Okay, that'll be $50.
610000	612000	Nice.
612000	618000	Now, maybe the PlayStation 3 installation, that might be something that's going to take so long for some of those games.
618000	620000	Alright, you know.
620000	622000	Well, we'll be handling it now.
622000	624000	What's my poll cry?
624000	632000	There's a game that I played a while back and I think maybe during one of these shows back at our old apartment, Rob, but it's a game called Defend Your Castle.
632000	641000	It's a little flash game where you defend your castle against stick figures and get archers and all sorts of things to defend them.
641000	648000	And also, basically what you do is you use your mouse to throw the stick figures away to keep away from your castle.
648000	653000	Well, now this is going to be coming to the WiiWare service as well.
653000	661000	It's actually going to be completely from the ground up and it's only $5 or 500 Wii points, which is pretty awesome.
661000	665000	And of course they built some new features into it as well.
665000	670000	And apparently unlimited levels, the game will just keep getting harder until you can't play it anymore.
670000	673000	So, that's pretty awesome.
673000	675000	I love games like that.
675000	678000	The old school Atari 2600 games, it never ended.
678000	680000	Like Kaboom?
680000	683000	What do you mean tell something with Kaboom?
683000	686000	It's going faster.
686000	688000	That's pretty awesome.
688000	695000	Another game that they've already announced coming to the service a while back was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles My Life as a King.
695000	698000	It's actually going to be a WiiWare launch title.
698000	703000	The price has been revealed to be $15 or 1500 Wii points.
703000	709000	And we'll be joining some other games as well, including of course Defend Your Castle and...
709000	715000	This one didn't make the list, but the major league eating the game, which looks like a piece of shit, and that will be...
715000	717000	But that's not what you're eating.
717000	721000	No, it's not a piece of shit that you're eating, but the game looks like... looks like pooey.
721000	723000	Like stuff on your Wii.
723000	724000	A piece of pooey.
724000	726000	No one likes stuff on their Wii.
726000	729000	And I've never heard of poo as an adjective, but there you go.
729000	732000	And it's coming out May 12th in the US.
732000	736000	Here's my question, is that the Final Fantasy game that was supposed to be the launch title?
736000	739000	Yeah, it's the Final Fantasy sort of SimCity mashup type thing.
739000	744000	RossDielYajinachat says FFPC will also use your entire Wii memory, is that true?
744000	746000	That would kind of suck.
746000	750000	I don't know about that, but they needed to figure out something with the whole Wii memory shit.
750000	751000	Seriously?
751000	758000	You know, if you can put these on a flashcard, maybe that's kind of cool, but from what I hear you can't, and that's kind of like...
758000	764000	I would like to think that maybe they can do an upgrade right when the WiiWare comes out and then you can start using flashcards, but who knows?
764000	771000	One thing that Nintendo can get right though is the peripherals, I mean they will crank out those Wii wheels for Mario Kart.
771000	776000	Here's the thing though that's kind of weird is that it will actually be sold separately other places.
776000	784000	Fumitsu over in Japan has revealed that Nintendo is going to be selling the Wii wheels separately for about $11.
784000	791000	No word yet if we're going to get that separately as well, but you know that if Nintendo doesn't officially put them out themselves, which they probably will,
791000	794000	you're going to have third-party developers of the wazoo doing this.
794000	799000	Because it does kind of make sense to have the separate Wii wheels because, you know, the same reason you have separate DDR pads.
799000	801000	Sometimes you want to play two-player.
801000	805000	They will be coming out separately here at the same time as Mario Kart.
805000	806000	Oh really?
806000	807000	Yes.
807000	808000	And you know this to be fact.
808000	809000	I know, it's a good fact.
809000	810000	Well there you have it then.
810000	819000	And it's the same reason why, because a little screaming Billy wants fucking, you know, his own wheels and then wants to share it with his sister or something like that and say it's about two fucking plastic wheels.
819000	823000	They're just plastic wheels, folks. And seriously, you can buy them now.
823000	825000	I mean, just third-party things.
825000	828000	And it's completely, absolutely useless.
828000	830000	I mean, you don't need this thing to play the game.
830000	833000	I love this. This is my favorite comment in the wild.
833000	834000	Rob SteelheapT in chat says,
834000	841000	Guys, say that the DDR pad has functionality and the Wii is a dumbass wheel.
841000	843000	Touche.
843000	845000	Touche.
845000	850000	I just like the fact that this game controls with as many options as they have for Smash Brothers.
850000	855000	Classic controller, GameCube, remote nunchuck, and then the thing sideways.
855000	857000	No fucking way.
857000	858000	DarkHatsuyu says,
858000	862000	I wish there was a wheel that let the Wiimote fit vertically so I could use it on me for speed carving.
862000	864000	Well that's the thing too.
864000	866000	That's the thing that pisses me off about this game.
866000	872000	If you've ever played one of these games that uses the wheels sideways like, you know, Mario Kart says,
872000	877000	or like, say, some of these other games that use the wheels, it's really horribly uncomfortable.
877000	884000	You know, Excite Truck uses the wheel, or the remote, actually vertical so that the buttons are on top of the thing,
884000	889000	and it's pretty comfortable doing it that way, but holding it sideways, you have to kind of contort your whole wrist,
889000	892000	and it really hurts your hand playing it for a while.
892000	895000	In related news, I still kind of like Excite Truck.
895000	899000	Excite Truck's fucking awesome, and they need to fucking make a new one!
899000	903000	I've already finished the game, my wife has finished the game, if that's saying something.
903000	907000	For the love of God, give Loki's wife a game to get excited about.
907000	910000	Make poor tracks if you don't want to make a new game.
910000	914000	I don't care, I will buy them for whatever price you want to charge.
914000	916000	I just need some more Excite Truck.
916000	920000	I don't want to have to buy Motorstorm 2, one wasn't very impressive.
920000	921000	That and custom soundtracks.
921000	924000	I mean, Excite Truck was kind of neat.
924000	931000	Okay, I can understand Excite Truck, that's fine, because that game really does need custom soundtracks.
931000	934000	But like Endless Ocean? What the fuck?
934000	937000	You don't need custom soundtracks in that game.
937000	941000	You can't swim through the ocean and rob zombies, it's just not right.
941000	942000	It's too slow.
942000	944000	Excite Truck's fucking awesome.
944000	950000	You could play through Excite Truck's physical leaks, now that we know.
950000	955000	I always play Excite Truck to everything, from Eurobeat stuff to...
955000	956000	That makes sense.
956000	960000	My wife, she likes playing it to Justin Timberlake for some reason.
960000	963000	I know it's funny, but you know what?
963000	967000	Every time I hear a Justin Timberlake song now, I think of Excite Truck.
967000	971000	I get to play it to like, really cool shit.
971000	977000	Speaking of marketing tools, I did find something very disturbing that my husband showed me on YouTube.
977000	980000	Using World of Warcraft to advertise Toyota trucks.
980000	983000	Oh yeah, that thing is hilarious, that commercial.
983000	984000	I finally saw it.
984000	985000	Oh boy.
985000	991000	I just, I don't know, Excite Truck, it wasn't that hard to make, and I just hope they have the option to download more tracks for many a game.
991000	997000	What if they were to do like, a different type of vehicle for an Excite something game?
997000	999000	As long as it plays the same, I don't care.
999000	1000000	Excite Boat.
1000000	1003000	Excite ATV, that would be one for a certain game.
1003000	1006000	Excite, here you go, Excite ATV on the Moon.
1006000	1007000	Whoa!
1007000	1010000	Well they didn't have a space level, do you remember Nebula?
1010000	1011000	Oh, that's true.
1011000	1012000	That's true.
1012000	1013000	Alright, okay.
1013000	1019000	Now we've turned in our most current news, talking about Mario Kart Wii into Excite Truck or other things somehow.
1019000	1021000	So, sorry, the best briefing game on the Wii then.
1021000	1024000	You know, Mario Kart really should move on.
1024000	1027000	I have some Wii related stuff only, it's more current in a virtual console.
1027000	1031000	And specifically for our friends in the UK.
1031000	1040000	The games that are coming out this week from PAL region is Super Turrican, that was a Super Nintendo game.
1040000	1044000	And Psychosis, that was on the TurboGrafx-16.
1044000	1048000	Factor 5 named Super Turrican is 800 points.
1048000	1051000	It uses the Classic and GameCube controller.
1051000	1059000	Psychosis is 600 V-points, and it also uses the Classic and Cube pads, and also uses the V-mode.
1059000	1067000	And for anyone who hasn't heard of Psychosis, because I know the TurboGrafx-16 could be on the obscure end, it's a side-scrolling shooter.
1067000	1076000	You can also position satellites around your ship and still stuff it in.
1076000	1078000	Killing with satellites is awesome.
1078000	1079000	Hooray, killing!
1079000	1081000	I agree.
1081000	1088000	So, if you don't want to mod your Wii, there are other options now for you to be able to play import games.
1088000	1090000	Thanks to the freeloader.
1090000	1097000	Of course, you may remember that from the GameCube, as being able to play wonderful import games.
1097000	1101000	Gojoskis is now offering the freeloader for the Wii.
1101000	1103000	It's going to do a bunch of other things, though.
1103000	1110000	It's going to be for $19.99 in the US, UK for £9.99, I believe.
1110000	1114000	And it's going to allow a couple of different things to happen.
1114000	1121000	One, it will stop any updates that are on the game disc, so you don't end up with duplicate channels and import stuff.
1121000	1124000	That's kind of what happens. Not a big deal, but annoying.
1124000	1136000	And it will also be kind of invisible to your console, so that they hope that there will be no updates to destroy it, like they did with the GameCube one.
1136000	1144000	It is available now, and hopefully will be broken soon.
1144000	1154000	So, you know, we had a little bit of controversy last week, and I'm sure it's going to continue on into our Mailbag and Skype statements this week.
1154000	1161000	Would you say there is a legitimate, non-shady purpose for this?
1161000	1169000	Yeah, there's a lot of games that come out in Japan that we don't get here, or even in Europe that we don't get here.
1169000	1175000	And, you know, for those people that really want to legitimately import stuff, you know, this is great to do.
1175000	1178000	It's expensive, but, you know, it's great to import games.
1178000	1179000	Or get stuff early.
1179000	1191000	So, like on my GameCube, I had Silver Caliber 2, and I also had one of the Battletoad Fighters, you know, back and forth, all of them over here.
1191000	1198000	You know, if this was more like, you know, the DS or something like that, where it was a region 3, I think you'd see a lot more people buying games from other regions, you know.
1198000	1208000	Here's my crowd, or here's my question to the crowd about, you know, because we had kind of two different, very opposite sides, talking about whole modding and all that stuff last week.
1208000	1216000	My question is, to the people that are not, that do not support mod chips and piracy and all that stuff, is the freeloader ethical?
1216000	1218000	That's my question, I'm kind of curious.
1218000	1223000	Like, are you okay with the freeloader, seeing that there is a very legitimate purpose to it?
1223000	1225000	I would think so, because you can't pirate games with it.
1225000	1227000	Ah, okay.
1227000	1231000	You know, as far as we're aware, I mean, you can't pirate games with it, but...
1231000	1233000	Is it one of those it's just a matter of time things?
1233000	1241000	Who knows, I mean, with the freeloader, I mean, I don't think, he can change the region on it, so, who knows?
1241000	1247000	I mean, because it's obviously tricking the console into thinking something that, you know, is not really there.
1247000	1258000	My thing would be, like I said, you know, because now we're getting these staggered release dates, you know, like Mario Kart in the UK is coming out, you know, a couple weeks before, you know, the US release.
1258000	1262000	I mean, if you really wanted to, you could actually get that name early in English and be able to play it.
1262000	1266000	Comments from chat, rostielut says, well, if you can't pirate games, then by all means.
1266000	1269000	Son of Dad says, yes, I just want to play the games.
1269000	1273000	DJ Jenai says, yes, I want to play all games no matter what.
1273000	1288000	There's another thing, too, that actually was mentioned on the blurb on the freeloader sales area, was that for people who have non-region systems, that this is a way to play local games.
1288000	1299000	Like, I, you know, I actually have a few friends who, you know, bought their Wii when they lived in Japan and moved back to the US and couldn't buy local games, had to import everything.
1299000	1304000	And in case you're wondering, too, this will also allow you to play any region GameCube games as well.
1304000	1310000	So if you had one of the GameCube freeloaders and stopped working on it because of the update, this will fix it.
1310000	1323000	All right. Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing some feedback from some of our listeners, because I know we have a lot of listeners that are into import gaming, because one of the fewer gaming podcasts actually cover kind of the import team outside of just America.
1323000	1326000	So I'm kind of curious what one of our listeners, some of our listeners should use this.
1326000	1328000	Are you getting one, Loki, or are you not bothering to get one?
1328000	1330000	I'm not bothering, but I have a hardship.
1330000	1331000	I have a hardship.
1331000	1332000	So, you know.
1332000	1333000	Director, you are going to be getting one, right?
1333000	1335000	I am going to get one. I'm kidding.
1335000	1336000	Let me know what you think.
1336000	1340000	I don't have any import games to test it on except for my GameCube one.
1340000	1341000	Thank you, Barbara.
1341000	1345000	Look at me volunteering.
1345000	1349000	Me, personally, I don't get to import games enough to get one.
1349000	1353000	The only import game I've ever really gone crazy for was the media studio.
1353000	1361000	I say I used to get crazy all the time on PS2, but, you know, even the little footage you did, you know I had to get Buzzfeed back in the day.
1361000	1363000	Yeah, I actually have a Japanese PlayStation 2.
1363000	1364000	I still do. I wonder if it works.
1364000	1365000	I have a Japanese Dreamcast.
1365000	1372000	For some reason I decided that Wangian Midnight for the PS3, that was a mistake, and I can't import any more PS3 games.
1372000	1373000	Was it not good?
1373000	1374000	It was shit.
1374000	1375000	Does it play?
1375000	1380000	Yeah, it plays just fine. PlayStation 3s are region 3, so.
1380000	1381000	Alright.
1381000	1382000	Alright, anyhow.
1382000	1392000	Let's move on, because speaking of the mailbag, I know we want to get there and it's coming right up, but real quick, I want to give you one more Wii story, and that's about Wii Fit.
1392000	1394000	Wii Fit has been given a price in Europe.
1394000	1403000	If you're going to buy the game in the UK, it's going to be 69.99, but the rest of Europe will pay 89.99 in the, you know, Euros.
1403000	1406000	It's 69.99 pounds, 89.99 Euros.
1406000	1410000	If you convert it to US dollars, that's about 130.
1410000	1415000	It's already been announced that in the US it will come out for under 100 dollars.
1415000	1418000	I'm not sure if we know an exact price yet.
1418000	1421000	Maybe if I think really hard, one will come to me.
1421000	1425000	I'm thinking, I'm thinking, hmm.
1425000	1427000	What would be a good price for that?
1427000	1428000	I'm thinking.
1428000	1429000	Make it nice and simple.
1429000	1430000	99.99?
1430000	1432000	No, 99.99 would be too much I would think.
1432000	1434000	Oh, well how about 89.99?
1434000	1437000	That's about right.
1437000	1439000	That sounds like a good price for that.
1439000	1440000	I think that's pretty fair.
1440000	1442000	Alright, 89.99, you think that would be a good price?
1442000	1444000	I think that's a good price for that, yeah.
1444000	1446000	I'd buy it for 89.99.
1446000	1448000	I'd buy that for 89.99.
1448000	1455000	Alright, well anyhow, but you know, face it, in Europe, unfortunately, you are paying more for games usually.
1455000	1461000	So while we might get it for 89.99, might get it for 89.99, we possibly will get it for 89.99.
1461000	1467000	You guys will have to pay 89.99 Euros, which is considerably more.
1467000	1469000	Sorry to break it to you.
1469000	1472000	Alright, anyhow, let's open up the old mailbag.
1472000	1477000	We love to hear from our listeners and every week you guys email us at mailbag.org.com.
1477000	1482000	DarkStalker likes to dive into the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite emails.
1482000	1483000	She's going to read them right now.
1483000	1486000	I have my snorkel ready.
1486000	1489000	And your rubber gloves?
1489000	1492000	Yeah, I'm going to do that.
1492000	1494000	Just in case of the Ambrac.
1494000	1498000	Uhhh, can I draw?
1498000	1501000	I think I have, well no, no, no, no, no, I have something far better.
1501000	1503000	I'm talking about that 80s band, not the uh...
1503000	1505000	I like Ambrac!
1505000	1506000	Alright, sorry.
1506000	1510000	Excuse me, Ambrac from Public Enemy is like the best combination ever.
1510000	1512000	Hi!
1512000	1516000	Speaking of great bands in the past, do you know what band really needs to...
1516000	1521000	I've decided after all the commercials on TV, do you know what band really needs to come to Rock Band?
1521000	1522000	What?
1522000	1523000	Jefferson Airplane.
1523000	1524000	Oh, hell yeah!
1524000	1526000	Alright, sorry, mailbag?
1526000	1528000	I don't know.
1528000	1531000	You don't need to get me started because I was exploring my favorite old band.
1531000	1532000	But anyway.
1532000	1534000	And it became Starship.
1534000	1536000	Yes, Jefferson Starship.
1536000	1538000	Anyway, pardon me.
1538000	1542000	You need to see the Lost Odyssey commercial with the white rabbit music.
1542000	1543000	It's pretty awesome.
1543000	1544000	Oh, you do too, thank you.
1544000	1545000	Alright, please do.
1545000	1547000	Okay, first email is from Cheezburger.
1547000	1552000	Hi guys, I just got another viewpoint card and I already spent $40 on it.
1552000	1557000	The games I have right now are Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario World, Donkey Kong, Paper Mario, and Star Fox.
1557000	1558000	Star Fox.
1558000	1564000	Boy, do you flip it there, Ms. Zarka?
1564000	1566000	I don't know that.
1566000	1569000	I'm going to throw that mic or something.
1569000	1571000	There's a little rock band in this room.
1571000	1577000	This is why we don't have text chat.
1577000	1581000	After the show, are you going to get a coffee at Star Fox?
1581000	1582000	Sorry.
1582000	1587000	That was just my broken finger, of course, extending on its own.
1587000	1591000	I got to get a shot in my hand.
1591000	1597000	Anyway, I was wondering what other good games are on there that I should get.
1597000	1599000	Thanks guys, you get me through the week.
1599000	1602000	Dude, you did not get Super Metroid.
1602000	1603000	Get it.
1603000	1606000	Oh, so you need more game recommendations.
1606000	1607000	Super Metroid.
1607000	1609000	Yeah, definitely some Super Metroid.
1609000	1610000	Devil's Crush.
1610000	1611000	No, it was Alien Crush.
1611000	1613000	Guardian or Gunstar Heroes.
1613000	1615000	Gunstar Heroes, Alien Crush.
1615000	1617000	Yeah, your list needs more Sega.
1617000	1620000	I think that there was not enough Sega in the list.
1620000	1622000	This is only three hours.
1622000	1623000	Yeah, I think they all are.
1623000	1627000	Mario Kart 64.
1627000	1629000	Mario 64.
1629000	1631000	Maybe Mario Kart, like, gathering those.
1631000	1632000	Mario Kart.
1632000	1635000	Oh, I bet that's the Mario Kart you got here.
1635000	1636000	I bet.
1636000	1638000	You want Super Metroid now.
1638000	1640000	Get Mario.
1640000	1641000	And go get Super Metroid.
1641000	1645000	Darkstalker, a chat room, wanted to see if you would get this reference.
1645000	1646000	Okay.
1658000	1663000	The baseline is the opening of the...
1663000	1665000	I'm waiting for the chorus.
1665000	1672000	Oh, it's going to cut off before the chorus.
1672000	1675000	It's Starfuckers by the name of it.
1675000	1677000	No, I don't...
1677000	1681000	I know, because I don't really like that song.
1681000	1683000	But it does have a sweet bass line.
1683000	1686000	The bass line is what made me think of that song, actually.
1686000	1687000	Oh, okay.
1689000	1693000	I did see this really awful band, and we went outside, and their bass line...
1693000	1697000	It was a band called 8-Bit.
1697000	1699000	They weren't very good.
1699000	1703000	So they were rapping and wearing half-nap suits.
1703000	1707000	But we were coming back from drinking at the pyramid across the street.
1707000	1710000	This is at the Gilman in Berkeley.
1710000	1715000	And we came back and stood outside, and their bass line was The Legend of Zelda theme.
1715000	1717000	Their bass line was...
1717000	1720000	Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
1720000	1723000	They were awful, though.
1723000	1725000	I thought it was awful.
1725000	1729000	But Babyland played that show, so Babyland reviewed the whole thing.
1729000	1730000	All right.
1730000	1732000	Moving on, please.
1732000	1738000	Okay, it seems like there's some head tracking popping up lately in console world.
1738000	1743000	Everyone keeps looking at Sony One at GDC.
1743000	1747000	I'm surprised nobody knows what the TrackIR is that's been going around for years.
1747000	1750000	I have one, and it works great.
1750000	1754000	It is only for the PC, though it has six degrees of movement.
1754000	1761000	And you can use it as a mouse control so that you can use it with any game that doesn't have direct support for the TrackIR.
1761000	1764000	It's really huge for racing and flight games.
1764000	1768000	There is one FPS game that it does support.
1768000	1770000	And that's from Pendragon.
1770000	1774000	I guess this game should be used for Marble Madness.
1774000	1777000	Heck yeah, that's a game we need a new version of.
1777000	1782000	Or even better, to watch someone play, like, Golden Key.
1782000	1783000	Nice.
1783000	1785000	It's a little competitive.
1785000	1787000	You bring your head around.
1787000	1788000	All right.
1788000	1789000	That's all we got.
1789000	1791000	Next, even.
1791000	1793000	Loki, Darth Vader, and Sky.
1793000	1796000	With regards to the call and last episode about system hacking,
1796000	1800000	I have to comment, true, if there was some of the content that it hacked,
1800000	1803000	firmware allows you to play games without paying for them.
1803000	1805000	And even though this can be seen as wrong,
1805000	1809000	I think that it's kind of funny that they can do this in the first place.
1809000	1815000	But some of the firmware is better than the proper firmware.
1815000	1819000	For example, a Skype program is only for thin PFCs.
1819000	1822000	If they can get it to work on thick PFCs, more power to them.
1822000	1825000	As it is more fierce, everything works on those systems.
1825000	1828000	Also, if they can get three games that people make to work
1828000	1830000	that as cool as home-made games are good.
1830000	1834000	I also believe that if you do stop talking about hacks,
1834000	1837000	then you would mess up on a huge part of the gaming world.
1837000	1839000	And I'm just saying this only as a reply to the call.
1839000	1841000	I know you won't.
1841000	1845000	Secondly, you often talk about how the PlayStation 3 is a joint letdown,
1845000	1848000	but I have to say,
1848000	1851000	fair play that there are a lot more games than the Xbox 360,
1851000	1854000	but I am the only person I make up for friends to have a PS3,
1854000	1856000	and I will think every single one of the other Xboxes
1856000	1859000	has three rings at one point or the other.
1859000	1862000	Finally, keep up the good show and hope Skype feels better.
1862000	1865000	Why not?
1865000	1867000	Well, thank you. I am feeling better.
1867000	1870000	And you do bring up an issue about...
1870000	1872000	Oh, I still sniffle a lot. My sciences are still kind of weird.
1872000	1875000	Anyway, you do bring up a good issue about the whole...
1875000	1878000	The firmwares definitely do serve a legitimate purpose,
1878000	1881000	and I think that's how a lot of the people get away with this
1881000	1882000	and get them to the radar,
1882000	1884000	because there is a legitimate purpose for a lot of this,
1884000	1887000	but I think it just becomes a moral issue about how you choose to use it.
1887000	1891000	I mean, if you choose to use it to get Skype on your PSP,
1891000	1893000	which is free anyway, that whole thing,
1893000	1899000	I don't think that's as big of a moral problem, so to speak,
1899000	1904000	as getting this on there so you can hack-store all the NES games from your past
1904000	1908000	or better yet, download all the PlayStation 1 games you always want to play
1908000	1912000	and all that, or PSP games.
1912000	1914000	You know, that's just a moral problem. I'm not saying one's right or wrong,
1914000	1915000	because there's a lot...
1915000	1919000	You know, a lot of people steal music like there's no tomorrow.
1919000	1923000	Well, there's a lot of legitimate things that they've started in homebrew
1923000	1926000	that I think Sonya saw, and they're like,
1926000	1929000	hey, let's throw that into an official release.
1929000	1932000	Like, for example, internet streaming radio.
1932000	1936000	That's been available on the homebrew scene for a long time now,
1936000	1938000	and then they, what, locked up.
1938000	1941000	They finally implemented some of that stuff.
1941000	1944000	I don't know. There's a lot of stuff that comes out of there.
1944000	1948000	They have YouTube stuff that you can view now straight on your PSP.
1948000	1954000	You know, they had stuff that hooked up to your GPS a while back,
1954000	1957000	even before they had the GPS for the PSP.
1957000	1959000	There's a lot of stuff, and now they're coming out with Hercorals.
1959000	1962000	They're like kill-centered stuff. It's Chrome group.
1962000	1968000	Basically, you have the force. It's your choice if you wish to turn to the dark side.
1968000	1970000	Yeah. All right.
1970000	1971000	Next e-mail?
1971000	1972000	Sure.
1972000	1976000	Hey, OLR crew. I was just e-mailing to give my side of the modding talk.
1976000	1981000	I was apparently crucified simply for asking what the legitimate question by Rosso UT...
1981000	1983000	Hold up. Is this the e-mail?
1983000	1986000	This is the one that Rosso UT had called in to respond to last week.
1986000	1988000	Same person, I'm assuming?
1988000	1990000	I think so, yeah.
1990000	1993000	Just curious. Just want to get that out there.
1993000	1996000	Because he doesn't agree with modding.
1996000	1998000	Mod chips are part of gaming culture and community.
1998000	2003000	Just because they can do bad doesn't mean people are doing bad things with them.
2003000	2007000	I can include a whole bunch of negative comments towards Rob, Jamie, and Loki,
2007000	2012000	but I have this thing where I go and attack people I've never met or know nothing about.
2012000	2016000	Rob doesn't want to attack us. We're super cool.
2016000	2021000	Rob was the only one who even bothered to give me a fair chance.
2021000	2023000	I gave him a fair chance.
2023000	2025000	What did I do? All right. Whatever.
2025000	2029000	I think he must have typed this right as he was listening to the call.
2029000	2031000	Give it a little slack.
2031000	2036000	Not all of the people who do mod are people who sit behind our computers wearing a ski mask trying to steal games from the internet.
2036000	2042000	People back up their DVDs and music CDs, so I've seen their reviews of why it's such a gray area when it comes to games.
2042000	2047000	Some people use mod chips to preserve their investments, others are interested in the technical aspects of it,
2047000	2050000	and yet they are the group who simply wish to steal games.
2050000	2056000	I like hearing Loki's talk about him trying to fix the 360 and all the modifications he does to it along with the Bmod.
2056000	2060000	It's just part of gaming culture and I'm glad LLR doesn't filter topics like this.
2060000	2064000	I just wish that some listeners wouldn't jump down the road to people who are interested in modding.
2064000	2069000	Next time my $50 game gets destroyed out of my hands, I'll send you anti-modders the bill.
2069000	2072000	And Loki, you helped me a lot with your tips.
2072000	2076000	I got my mod, I got my chips successfully installed so no more coasters for me.
2076000	2079000	Epic Glyn. I hope you feel better than Sweet Rob's HP for friends.
2079000	2083000	But this email is prompted by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending Dallas, Arizona.
2083000	2086000	You need to have Olive Garden night pretty soon.
2086000	2089000	Or surreal in how you have food for once.
2089000	2091000	I don't know though.
2091000	2093000	I can actually go to get food.
2093000	2095000	I just ate there a couple days ago.
2095000	2098000	I'm just saying that I can, I found things I can eat.
2098000	2100000	Yeah, they have all their altered puffs and stuff.
2100000	2102000	Okay, here's the deal.
2102000	2107000	I totally agree with what he's saying about that it is a part of gaming culture and that's what we're all about,
2107000	2109000	so that's why we need to cover it on the show.
2109000	2113000	And I think he made some good points.
2113000	2115000	I think the con made some good points.
2115000	2119000	Here's something you've got to understand though, is that we have a lot of,
2119000	2124000	I shouldn't say a lot, but we do have some developers, authors,
2124000	2128000	people that make games that actually listen to this program.
2128000	2133000	And I'm sure it might ruffle their feathers a little bit to hear about this kind of talk that we're talking about these games.
2133000	2140000	We don't advocate that you should go and steal a bunch of games because you're taking money from these people.
2140000	2144000	But that's why people get passionate about the issue because a lot of folks listen to the show,
2144000	2149000	they might work in games or make games and they hear about these things that allow people to steal their work
2149000	2154000	and that's why there's layoffs at game companies and things go down and dah, dah, dah.
2154000	2160000	So I don't know, but it's almost like, here, I don't know, kind of taking it a step further.
2160000	2165000	As long as this stuff continues, it's going to be interesting because I think the game industry has the potential to turn into
2165000	2169000	almost kind of what the music industry is doing where I think especially through things,
2169000	2172000	that's why I said last week, I think that XNA thing is such huge news
2172000	2177000	because I think in the future you're going to start seeing a lot more download your games
2177000	2183000	and indie developers making things in-house that you download, just kind of like music is turning into
2183000	2187000	where more stuff is getting out there because of iTunes and stuff.
2187000	2192000	But I think we're about five, maybe even ten years away from that, but anyhow.
2192000	2195000	That's my ramble.
2195000	2197000	Yeah, my little ramble.
2197000	2199000	There's no easy solution.
2199000	2202000	There's nothing any of us are going to say that's going to please both sides of it.
2202000	2206000	I think, though, we're doing a disservice by ignoring it.
2206000	2209000	Ignoring it's not going to make it go away.
2209000	2213000	Personally, I have no problem with that, but someone wants to do.
2213000	2216000	It's not my place to tell anybody what they can or can't do.
2216000	2220000	It's just up to them if they want to deal with the consequences of being caught.
2220000	2221000	Right, and here's one thing.
2221000	2226000	Realize at any time one of these companies may come up with a magic patch
2226000	2230000	that's going to nerf your Wii if you mod it, and there's going to be no choice.
2230000	2233000	You're going to have to install the thing to play the latest game or something.
2233000	2236000	It's not just going to render the game an apple.
2236000	2238000	It's going to completely nerf your freaking Wii.
2238000	2240000	You're bricking iPhones.
2240000	2243000	Exactly, bricking iPhones and all that stuff, so that's the chance you take.
2243000	2249000	Someday your thing's going to get bricked, and that's the chance you took.
2249000	2251000	Yeah.
2251000	2252000	There you have it.
2252000	2254000	That's it.
2254000	2255000	For me.
2255000	2256000	Next email.
2256000	2263000	Hi Sky, Lucy, and DarkSakura, I'm emailing you on behalf of the semi-obliterated PS2 sitting in a bag in my room.
2263000	2266000	The other day I arrived at school suspecting it would be like any other day,
2266000	2268000	one of my friends informed me in his wisdom,
2268000	2271000	since PS2 stopped working the previous afternoon,
2271000	2274000	and actually he took a hammer to the case and smashed it open.
2274000	2278000	The irony here is that before the fan had only chipped a few teeth,
2278000	2281000	and now the case is done for, the melting from the inside are bent,
2281000	2283000	and the laser may be broken, but I'm not sure.
2283000	2285000	One of the ribbons has been damaged.
2285000	2287000	I've taken the console from him,
2287000	2291000	and I was just wondering whether any of you know of a good site that I could get spare parts from,
2291000	2294000	and particularly if lucky enough there were a way to test the laser,
2294000	2296000	with a lot of parts on the needle.
2296000	2299000	I know you can order replacement parts from Sony,
2299000	2302000	but you could pretty much.
2302000	2304000	I don't know if you can still order stuff from them,
2304000	2308000	but I was going to say,
2308000	2311000	I don't know, the only way to test the laser, I would think,
2311000	2313000	is to put a game in it and actually test it.
2313000	2318000	For spare parts though, you might be able to check out llama.com.
2318000	2322000	I've gotten some Xbox 360 mods set from there.
2322000	2326000	I don't know if they carry PlayStation 2 stuff anymore, I think they do.
2326000	2329000	Do they have like official, I'm sorry, Microsoft,
2329000	2331000	do they have like official Sony repair centers,
2331000	2333000	like they have for some other types of products?
2333000	2338000	Like maybe there's a place you can take your PS2 and get just the laser thingy tweaked?
2338000	2341000	Maybe.
2341000	2342000	I don't know.
2342000	2343000	I'm sorry, I might have missed it.
2343000	2344000	How old did you say the PlayStation 2 was?
2344000	2346000	Did you say it was like an old school one?
2346000	2348000	Um, it did not say.
2348000	2353000	You know, if it's one of the old school, you know, huge, you know, PlayStation 2s,
2353000	2355000	the old model, it might just be time,
2355000	2357000	because obviously by the time you fix some of this stuff,
2357000	2360000	you're practically paying what you pay for a PS2 mini.
2360000	2362000	People put broken ones on these days, they're too lengthy.
2362000	2364000	Yeah.
2364000	2367000	Yeah, you can, I mean, they're kind of getting cheap now,
2367000	2373000	you can probably find a cheap PS2 for, you know, nothing.
2373000	2377000	I mean, Rockdale UT in chat says,
2377000	2382000	if the system isn't too bashed up, you can get it fixed at www.oldschoolgamer.ca,
2382000	2384000	but that indicates it's Canadian.
2384000	2386000	I don't know if that would work.
2386000	2392000	Yeah, I mean, your cables and stuff, your ribbon cables,
2392000	2398000	they're about $10, and then the lens is about $40.
2398000	2402000	So right there, it's $50, that's half the price of your PS2, mine is $99.
2402000	2406000	Okay, I'm looking on the Gamestop website,
2406000	2409000	and I don't know, we can go and buy some Gamestop,
2409000	2419000	but the old style PS2 refurb is $79.99, so the new style is $99.99.
2419000	2423000	And if you find them at just the used ones, they'll be cheaper than that.
2423000	2428000	And some of that is pointing out the Target was actually having a sale on PS2s last week for $99 new.
2428000	2432000	So, there you go.
2432000	2434000	Yeah, there you have it.
2434000	2436000	Keep an eye on those websites, you know,
2436000	2439000	I'm sure that's not the answer you wanted to hear, that we're telling you,
2439000	2441000	basically go buy a new PS2.
2441000	2444000	But keep an eye on those websites like CheapAssGamer
2444000	2446000	and some of those other video game deals websites too,
2446000	2449000	once in a while something might pop up there, so, you know, always keep an eye on it.
2449000	2452000	But if you do want to get your old system fixed,
2452000	2455000	there are ways that you might have to have a professional step in
2455000	2457000	or you're going to void your warranty.
2457000	2459000	It just might as well, at this point, just to buy a new one.
2459000	2462000	I mean, there's a point you got to say, well,
2462000	2464000	six months is a fix, it's just buy a new one.
2464000	2467000	But RossCOUT and Chapman have a good point.
2467000	2469000	Once he's a Final Fantasy XI player,
2469000	2471000	MIDI PS2 won't support the HDD.
2471000	2473000	Then buy an older one.
2473000	2475000	And quit Final Fantasy XI.
2475000	2476000	I'm just kidding.
2476000	2477000	I'm just kidding.
2477000	2479000	Oh yeah, you got to go to PC first.
2479000	2481000	All right, anyhow, sorry. More email?
2481000	2485000	Hey, I was a controller player on this machine.
2485000	2487000	I don't know how you play that game on a controller.
2487000	2488000	You've got me doing it.
2488000	2491000	I know, I just, and it was designed for controllers, the hilarious thing,
2491000	2493000	but I cannot play that game on anything by keyboard.
2493000	2495000	The macros are so easy with triggers.
2495000	2496000	They're really, really easy.
2496000	2497000	But anyway.
2497000	2498000	All right, anyhow.
2498000	2500000	Hey everyone, before I begin, there's a couple things I must say.
2500000	2501000	First of all, hail Jamie.
2501000	2502000	Worship.
2502000	2503000	Yes.
2503000	2504000	Who is this?
2504000	2505000	Oh, okay.
2505000	2507000	Ah, got me some new shoes.
2507000	2508000	Anyway.
2508000	2511000	Secondly, I want to say that I look forward to each episode Sunday night
2511000	2515000	and the podcasts that get me through my daily commute to and from work.
2515000	2518000	Now that the formalities are out of the way, just let me say this.
2518000	2521000	As I listen to Rosalie T's thoughts on modding,
2521000	2526000	I can tell that you Rob weren't too happy about that.
2526000	2531000	I can tell in your voice that you weren't that happy about that.
2531000	2535000	Let me just say that my PS2 has been modded for three plus years.
2535000	2539000	During that time, I have over $1,000 worth of bootleg games.
2539000	2540000	Why?
2540000	2543000	Simply because I do not have the money to shell out each week to buy new titles.
2543000	2544000	But all is lost.
2544000	2548000	On the positive side, playing crappy games allowed me the chance to play
2548000	2550000	and try out some of the games to see if I like it.
2550000	2553000	Honestly, no one here wants to drop 40 bucks on a PS2 game
2553000	2555000	to find out later that the game sucks some of the waste.
2555000	2559000	Having a modding console allows me to check out important games as well.
2559000	2563000	When I write this, I tend to think of myself as a hypocrite
2563000	2566000	because my real job consists of fixing computers with bootleg software.
2566000	2570000	I tell the customers not to use bootleg enterprise corporate software
2570000	2574000	as well as software that belongs to a friend of theirs.
2574000	2576000	But alas, some will not listen,
2576000	2579000	unlike also UTA does not take this to heart.
2579000	2582000	Overall, I do not see a problem with modded consoles.
2582000	2588000	Mods allow us to break things with consoles, not just copy slash burn games.
2588000	2591000	Now, if I download a game that's really good, then I would go out and buy it.
2591000	2592000	Case in point, Kingdom Hearts 2.
2592000	2596000	As a friend who is in the gaming industry
2596000	2598000	that gives me grief about copy games,
2598000	2601000	I say to her, are you going to buy me this game?
2601000	2602000	No, you're not.
2602000	2605000	Plus, I want to see if the game is actually worth buying.
2605000	2606000	And if it is, I'll buy it.
2606000	2609000	In the meantime, leave me be.
2609000	2612000	Overall, roughly, if you eat, shut up.
2612000	2614000	It doesn't matter to us.
2614000	2616000	We are not damaging the gaming industry at all.
2616000	2623000	From my knowledge, there's no proof of that as either.
2623000	2625000	There's usually what it comes down to,
2625000	2629000	and this is the same argument with MP3 downloading and stuff like that,
2629000	2632000	is everyone says that's a cycle thing.
2632000	2633000	It's just another cycle.
2633000	2639000	It's just people, the industry doesn't actually lose money from these people
2639000	2642000	because these people are never going to buy the product in the first place.
2642000	2646000	So you didn't miss out on a sale because they were never going to buy it.
2646000	2649000	Same with people downloading import games or something like that.
2649000	2651000	They weren't going to buy it in the first place.
2651000	2656000	The modern thinking is it's not going to hurt anybody.
2656000	2661000	Obviously, still, they could import it and spend the money and do that kind of stuff.
2661000	2663000	I don't know.
2663000	2669000	It's immoral, maybe, but is it really hurting the industry?
2669000	2670000	Maybe.
2670000	2672000	Not quite.
2672000	2674000	I don't know.
2674000	2679000	Say, for example, a lot of people are burning copies of Halo 3 or something like that.
2679000	2682000	Yeah, that's going to hurt the sales of that game,
2682000	2685000	especially if they were intending on buying it in the first place.
2685000	2687000	I don't know.
2687000	2691000	That's why a lot of companies now, though, and a lot of things that come out,
2691000	2698000	they spend the time on extra stuff like the packaging and the bonus stuff that comes with it
2698000	2702000	to entice people to actually buy their games instead of just letting it work.
2702000	2704000	And here's another thing.
2704000	2706000	Maybe people respect your games more.
2706000	2711000	Stop putting out shovelware looking at you, Destiny.
2711000	2717000	Just to address the part of the letter that talked about me getting kind of,
2717000	2721000	I don't know what he said about the call, but I didn't see half of that.
2721000	2722000	Here's the thing.
2722000	2724000	Well, A, I was sick last week, so coming from Slack.
2724000	2729000	So that kind of lends my sense of professionalism a little bit out the window,
2729000	2731000	especially because having a cam here doesn't help you.
2731000	2733000	If I make a motion or something, everybody sees it.
2733000	2736000	But also, it wasn't that I was unhappy about the statement
2736000	2738000	because I believe everybody has the right to their opinion
2738000	2740000	whether I personally agree with it or not.
2740000	2743000	And it makes me sad to see listeners attacking each other and stuff,
2743000	2746000	you know, hug it out, agree to disagree.
2746000	2748000	Here's the thing.
2748000	2750000	I kind of knew.
2750000	2752000	And that's interesting in a way.
2752000	2753000	It's part of the charm of the show.
2753000	2755000	We open up this guideline.
2755000	2757000	Anybody can call about anything.
2757000	2759000	You don't know what it's going to be.
2759000	2762000	And we're going to deal with it and talk about it on air.
2762000	2764000	It's kind of part of what makes this show unique.
2764000	2768000	But when the call came in, I kind of knew that it was opening a can of worms,
2768000	2770000	and that's why I wasn't happy.
2770000	2772000	It's not that I wasn't happy with the opinion or whatever.
2772000	2774000	I wasn't happy because I was just kind of like,
2774000	2777000	oh, boy, I know there's going to be e-mails on this next week
2777000	2779000	and probably some more calls later on tonight.
2779000	2786000	I was like, oh, I don't know if this was an epic battle I was awaiting.
2786000	2788000	The rest of this e-mail.
2788000	2789000	Thanks for reading my letter on air.
2789000	2792000	And, Rob, I apologize for using your shared call on the OLR listener,
2792000	2794000	but I cannot read this.
2794000	2798000	And allow traffic to be in the comments of Roswell, Utah, to go by unnoticed.
2798000	2801000	Rock on and have a most triumphant week.
2801000	2805000	If Roswell, Utah, wants to comment back by all means,
2805000	2808000	my e-mail, Addie, is listed, and I guess you can p.m.
2808000	2809000	Yeah, they're both in chat right now.
2809000	2810000	Hug it out, boys.
2810000	2811000	Hug it out.
2811000	2814000	And he wants me to plug his podcast, so I am.
2814000	2815000	Okay, fair enough.
2815000	2821000	Anime Jam Session at djromnet.net slash Anime Jam.
2821000	2823000	So listen to it.
2823000	2825000	But not right now, because we're live.
2825000	2826000	All right.
2826000	2828000	Any other e-mails, or is that it?
2828000	2829000	This one.
2829000	2831000	Dang, we have talent e-mails tonight.
2831000	2832000	I know.
2832000	2833000	All right, let's get through them.
2833000	2835000	Hey, OLR crew, I have a question for Dark Sakura.
2835000	2837000	Hey, cool.
2837000	2842000	You said months ago that you could pump up the volume on hold after your laptop got fried.
2842000	2844000	You know, that's how my PC got fried.
2844000	2845000	How is that coming along?
2845000	2848000	It would be great to listen to pump up the volume again someday.
2848000	2853000	It's a nice break from what the 24-7 stream provides on GS68.
2853000	2857000	Actually, there's progress in this today.
2857000	2862000	I've had a computer that I could use, but the problem is that I want something with
2862000	2867000	a bit more on the graphics capability side, just for the sake of all the other projects
2867000	2868000	I do.
2868000	2873000	And I have been using my laptop, but my laptop likes to run really freaking slow.
2873000	2878000	I think I'm actually going to replace all the memory in it.
2878000	2885000	But we have gutted out one of the Vio's sitting in our garage.
2885000	2890000	And although one of them is promised, that sort of leaves the other one up in the air
2890000	2892000	because it might be promised as well.
2892000	2897000	We are looking into putting a graphics card in it.
2897000	2901000	My old hard drive, basically building a new Frank computer for me.
2901000	2906000	That was what my old computer was, sort of the Frankenstein part.
2906000	2911000	Pump up the volume, it's all just a plan.
2911000	2916000	I'm looking for a return of pump up the volume soon.
2916000	2923000	However, I'm also going back to college, which I don't know if I've mentioned to my co-host
2923000	2924000	here.
2924000	2928000	But I am planning on going back to school and I'm finishing a degree this year and finishing
2928000	2929000	one next year too.
2929000	2932000	I forbid you learning more.
2932000	2935000	What is this education you speak of?
2935000	2936000	You don't mean that.
2936000	2938000	I am a year away.
2938000	2943000	You am educated enough.
2943000	2947000	I'm a year away from an AA.
2947000	2951000	I'm another year away from another AA.
2951000	2953000	And then I can go.
2953000	2957000	By the way, for those that may not know, because we do have the podcast, when she speaks of
2957000	2959000	pump up the volume, she's talking about one of her weeknight shows.
2959000	2962000	Yeah, it was when I said it didn't suck.
2962000	2966000	And we do have a couple of weeknight shows, just a handful right now.
2966000	2971000	I've got to be honest, if I didn't have a full-time job, trying to manage all that stuff
2971000	2973000	is difficult.
2973000	2980000	So I don't know, we may soon try to hire, for the pay is great, nothing, but some type
2980000	2984000	of director of weeknight programming that can get some of these great podcasts that
2984000	2986000	deserve to be heard on the live stream.
2986000	2988000	Just to try to sort that all out.
2988000	2989000	But then we have our website.
2989000	2990000	You can get updated too much.
2990000	2991000	No time?
2991000	2992000	Hey, good news.
2992000	2993000	Cheeseburgers taking RFI.
2993000	2994000	What's that?
2994000	2995000	Oh, buying Super Mentor.
2995000	2996000	Yep.
2996000	2997000	Swell.
2997000	3001000	Alright, one more email.
3001000	3003000	Last email.
3003000	3005000	Dun dun dun.
3005000	3016000	So this is worth it, because this is our buddy, Warrior Bob.
3016000	3017000	Yay.
3017000	3018000	Hi, host.
3018000	3019000	Hi, emailer.
3019000	3024000	It's so good to hear you mentioning the old Apogee and Epic software games last week.
3024000	3028000	Respected memories from times when computer games looked like computer games.
3028000	3032000	This is a topic that's been coming up recently in the looks of my friends and me.
3032000	3036000	Back when these games were the forefront of computer entertainment, back when Windows
3036000	3041000	had version numbers, PR made adventure games, and Duke Nukem games weren't named after
3041000	3043000	the development time.
3043000	3045000	I see what you did there.
3045000	3049000	There was a certain look and feel to computer games.
3049000	3054000	The visual animations and effects were the product of teams of technical artists, so
3054000	3058000	much as they were the result of clever programming tricks done by empty people.
3058000	3064000	Things like single pixel particle effects, characters made of multiple sprites, color
3064000	3066000	cycling distortions, that sort of thing.
3066000	3069000	I feel that it's kind of gone now, and I realize I missed it.
3069000	3072000	Don't get me wrong, I love the new ideas, too.
3072000	3077000	I wanted to see games like Shadows of Colossus and Rock Band ever since I was a little kid
3077000	3080000	with a bunch of game design scribbles in my notebook.
3080000	3085000	But at the same time, the only recent game I can think of that had the same computerized
3085000	3090000	feel I grew up on was Cave Story, a freeware indie title.
3090000	3093000	Entrenched as you all are in the video game scene, had you come across any games that
3093000	3095000	still embody this aesthetic?
3095000	3101000	I find I play games more for the experience than the challenge these days, and so I'd
3101000	3106000	love to find something like this and see what people with new ideas have done with old styles.
3106000	3107000	Thanks again, as always.
3107000	3109000	Keep up the excellent show, Warrior Bob.
3109000	3110000	P.S.
3110000	3111000	Hi, Dan.
3111000	3112000	I guess he was at first.
3112000	3114000	He was supposed to be on the show this week, too.
3114000	3116000	That's why I couldn't even put that.
3116000	3117000	That makes sense.
3117000	3120000	I know, and butthead didn't come, so whatever.
3120000	3124000	Here's my crazy thought, is that they don't make these games anymore because they just
3124000	3125000	didn't sell?
3125000	3133000	I have to say this, is that, and for lack of a, you know, I'm not trying to be mean
3133000	3136000	to anybody, but honestly, the market today is a lot more fickle.
3136000	3139000	They want it to look pretty, you know.
3139000	3143000	They don't care as much about the game, you know, the way the game plays.
3143000	3146000	They don't care as much about the experience of the game.
3146000	3150000	They want it to be pretty, and automatically it's not pretty as shit.
3150000	3153000	So that's what's happened.
3153000	3156000	They're playing towards a superficial market.
3156000	3157000	I think you're kind of right.
3157000	3159000	I think that is kind of what it boils down to.
3159000	3162000	Absolutely, computer games kind of lost their distinctive look, so to speak.
3162000	3166000	But then I look at a game like Sam & Max, and to me, that game is like a, it's almost
3166000	3167000	a throwback in a way.
3167000	3172000	It is kind of like those old LucasArts games, but in a newer, cartoony, visual-ish style.
3172000	3177000	So, I mean, they're out there, but yeah, it's not like it used to be then.
3177000	3183000	I remember walking into A-Head Software, and you'd have like, you know, Legend of Kyrandia
3183000	3187000	and King's Quest and all this stuff for sale, and you know, those were the days, but you
3187000	3189000	know, then again, A-Head Software went out of business.
3189000	3192000	So that tells me that, or at least they're online now or whatever, so that tells me that
3192000	3196000	you know, they just must not have been selling as well, as consoles really took off.
3196000	3197000	I love Kyrandia.
3197000	3198000	Me too!
3198000	3202000	My sister still plays, in fact, she is playing King's Quest VII right now.
3202000	3209000	I'll tell you what was funny, is I came very close to downloading a mug.
3209000	3210000	Those still running.
3210000	3211000	That's awesome.
3211000	3212000	There's a mug still running.
3212000	3216000	I'll have to find the link for you, but there's people who still do them.
3216000	3222000	There's BBS's set up so people can play Legend of the Red Dragon still online, which is like
3222000	3223000	hard, and The Pit.
3223000	3226000	Dude, we need an OLR BBS so we can play The Pit.
3226000	3230000	You know what my first, I would have to say real MMO was?
3230000	3232000	Gemstone 3.
3232000	3233000	Awesome.
3233000	3235000	It was all text.
3235000	3237000	Dude, how can we set up an OLR BBS?
3237000	3240000	I know it's going to be possible to be like Telnet or something.
3240000	3242000	How can we make that happen?
3242000	3243000	That shouldn't be possible.
3243000	3245000	Somebody email me if you know how to make that happen.
3245000	3247000	I wouldn't think that would be a good idea.
3247000	3248000	I know.
3248000	3250000	The OLR BBS, we're going to play The Pit with our wizards.
3250000	3251000	That'd be Red Train Wars.
3251000	3252000	That'd be bomb.
3252000	3254000	That would be, that would be fun.
3254000	3257000	Warrior Bob is actually in chat right now and says, see, yeah, that's just it.
3257000	3259000	FemiMax looks like a new 3D game.
3259000	3262000	No big pixels or clever animation anywhere.
3262000	3269000	Oh yeah, I think just the market, big pixels didn't sell, I guess.
3269000	3274000	Well, I mean, if you, if you want sprite-based stuff, I mean,
3274000	3278000	you still got, you know, like I'm playing Ragnarok online and honestly,
3278000	3280000	I've read up on Ragnarok too.
3280000	3284000	And while, yeah, it's cool, facial animation, ooh, you know, I,
3284000	3286000	I like my cute few sprites.
3286000	3288000	You know, I think it's cool.
3288000	3291000	I like that I can play it on a system that I don't have to have a whole
3291000	3295000	bunch of crap for because it still plays pretty damn fun.
3295000	3299000	You know, I, and I like Lulu.
3299000	3300000	I love Lulu.
3300000	3302000	Lulu is such a good game.
3302000	3308000	And I miss my old pixely games like Doom and Hexen.
3308000	3309000	I love Hexen.
3309000	3310000	I've covered Hexen.
3310000	3311000	Good times.
3311000	3313000	That's it for tonight.
3313000	3314000	Alrighty.
3314000	3315000	Get a piece of the war.
3315000	3317000	Dang, there was a lot of mailbags this week.
3317000	3318000	I know.
3318000	3322000	Mailbag to OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send your emails.
3322000	3323000	Hexen!
3323000	3325000	Alright, let's get back to some gaming news.
3325000	3327000	The segments weren't involved tonight.
3327000	3329000	I know.
3329000	3331000	Oh yeah, that would be neat, wouldn't it?
3331000	3332000	No.
3332000	3333000	Nope.
3333000	3334000	No, it's fine.
3334000	3335000	It's up.
3335000	3336000	Yeah.
3336000	3338000	I'm looking at one.
3338000	3346000	So, um, this whole Activision Blizzard merger thing, uh, happened a little bit ago, you
3346000	3349000	know, when they merged with Nvidia.
3349000	3354000	And, uh, because of that, some investors think that they're getting the bum end of the deal.
3354000	3360000	And in fact, actually, it's an Activision investor who sued over the entire merger.
3360000	3367000	Um, their complaint was that Nvidia actually comes out on top of the merger with 50% majority
3367000	3368000	ownership of Activision.
3368000	3375000	Um, and because of this, uh, didn't think that the stockholders, uh, or didn't think
3375000	3378000	of the stockholders when they accepted the deal.
3378000	3383000	So, that is their complaint and now they're, you know, pissed off about it.
3383000	3384000	I don't know.
3384000	3385000	I mean, shit.
3385000	3387000	Nvidia has some pretty good properties.
3387000	3392000	I don't think it's totally bad that they merged together, but I don't know.
3392000	3393000	You're a stockholder.
3393000	3397000	I guess you're getting jipped out of a few bucks.
3397000	3402000	Well, we must live in a sue-happy world because that wasn't the only lawsuit that happened
3402000	3403000	this week.
3403000	3408000	Capcom officially got sued by the MKR Group over the game Dead Rising because the MKR
3408000	3412000	Group, they own the rights to the movie Dawn of the Dead by George Romero.
3412000	3416000	And even though Dead Rising has a big old thing on it that says not Dawn of the Dead,
3416000	3417000	essentially, uh, Capcom got sued.
3417000	3424000	And as interesting as, I don't think they're going to win because the fact that, I mean,
3424000	3427000	can they really sue for, you know.
3427000	3430000	But they're zombies in a mall is a, is a very narrow market.
3430000	3432000	There's just not room for both.
3432000	3433000	Yeah, yeah.
3433000	3437000	Well, the lawsuit states, quote, in both that the recreational activities of the zombies
3437000	3444000	and absurdly grotesque kill scenes provide unexpected comedy, comedic relief.
3444000	3446000	Nice.
3446000	3449000	Um, but yeah, I know I kind of agree.
3449000	3453000	I kind of agree with what most of the people in chat are saying is that they're zombies
3453000	3454000	and they're in a mall.
3454000	3455000	That's it.
3455000	3457000	I mean, the characters aren't the same.
3457000	3459000	The plot's not really the same.
3459000	3460000	It's just zombies in a mall.
3460000	3463000	And how they become zombies aren't even the same.
3463000	3464000	Okay.
3464000	3469000	Here's my other thought is that, um, if Capcom hadn't put that thing on the box that says
3469000	3472000	it had nothing to do with Dawn of the Dead, do you think they would have gotten sued in
3472000	3473000	the first place?
3473000	3474000	Yeah.
3474000	3479000	Because my thing is that by putting that thing on there, it's almost like they admit, yeah,
3479000	3480000	there's a similarity here.
3480000	3481000	No.
3481000	3482000	But we, we don't intend it.
3482000	3483000	I don't know.
3483000	3489000	I think there was, you know, because then they could claim that, you know, they were
3489000	3493000	trying to trick the consumer into thinking it was a Dawn of the Dead type thing.
3493000	3498000	But this is just them kind of trying to, they were trying to be preventative about it and
3498000	3501000	cover their ass saying, no, this is not what it is.
3501000	3504000	Do they use lawn mowers in Dawn of the Dead?
3504000	3509000	Here, here's my other thing is that, I mean, if somebody buys Dead Rising, are they not
3509000	3512000	going to buy Dawn of the Dead?
3512000	3516000	You know, is that because, you know, to sort of claim that there's some type of like, you
3516000	3519000	know, oh, my rights have been abated and all this, you have to kind of claim that there's
3519000	3521000	financial losses going on.
3521000	3525000	And my kind of whole thing is that the type of people who play Dead Rising exactly would
3525000	3527000	go out and buy Dawn of the Dead.
3527000	3528000	So it's not like one's hurting the other.
3528000	3529000	You know what I mean?
3529000	3535000	SSJ 100 Matt says, why can't they make something original like zombies eating someone's neighbors?
3535000	3536000	Oh, wait.
3536000	3541000	Well, the next game supposedly wasn't going to be like, you know, in a mall and stuff.
3541000	3544000	It was just going to be some other zombies on a plane.
3544000	3547000	No, not zombies on a plane.
3547000	3549000	Zombies on the train.
3549000	3551000	Zombies on the moon.
3551000	3552000	Yes, exactly.
3552000	3553000	Zombies on the moon.
3553000	3554000	Yeah.
3554000	3555000	All right.
3555000	3558000	Well, anyway, this whole Sue happy world we live in just makes me angsty and people just
3558000	3559000	need to get over themselves.
3559000	3560000	So I think we need to do the F.U. of the week.
3560000	3561000	My F.U. of the week.
3561000	3562000	It's a big F.U. towards drama and death.
3562000	3563000	Yeah.
3563000	3592000	And tragedy.
3592000	3599000	I think F.U. to the crap they're going to do and the sources of said crap.
3599000	3600000	Unfortunately.
3600000	3602000	Is that it?
3602000	3603000	Yeah.
3603000	3604000	Okay.
3604000	3610000	That was a pretty heavy F.U. though, so not that I'm wanting there to be more, but.
3610000	3611000	All right.
3611000	3612000	Logie.
3612000	3616000	F.U. to Microsoft and, you know, kind of a little bit of rant.
3616000	3620000	I'm sure everybody's heard about the digital rights management, how it's all fucked up,
3620000	3625000	where you have a console that's basically three rings on you and content you purchased
3625000	3629000	on there now you can no longer use on your new console unless you're logged in live.
3629000	3632000	It's really retarded that they do that in the first place.
3632000	3636000	I've had that problem because, of course, I have a new console, even though I fixed
3636000	3637000	my own console.
3637000	3638000	It's funny.
3638000	3640000	It still doesn't work on my old console now either.
3640000	3642000	I don't know.
3642000	3644000	It's all fucked up right now.
3644000	3647000	My thing is, why isn't there a bit of lawsuit over that?
3647000	3651000	That's something actually legitimate that they can have a lawsuit over instead of, you
3651000	3655000	know, complaining about live outages or, you know, the three rings of death or whatever.
3655000	3659000	I think that they should sue them over the digital rights management and stuff because
3659000	3664000	if you bought content online and now you can't use it because your system broke because
3664000	3668000	they're faulty and Microsoft isn't doing anything about it.
3668000	3669000	Absolutely nothing.
3669000	3672000	There's countless stories on the Internet about this stuff.
3672000	3674000	So why isn't anyone suing them over that?
3674000	3676000	That's why I want to ask.
3676000	3681000	I just want to give an F.U. to the antibiotic I'm on this week.
3681000	3683000	I can't remember the name of it.
3683000	3687000	It's like Leviquim or Leptixim or I don't know what it's called.
3687000	3689000	Some antibiotic a doctor gave me.
3689000	3693000	A, it's a brand name drug so I have to pay more for it because they don't make it generic
3693000	3694000	of it.
3694000	3696000	And B, it's the slowest antibiotic I've ever had.
3696000	3700000	I'm allergic to penicillin so also F.U. to the fact that I'm allergic to penicillin because
3700000	3703000	then I can just take that and I'd be better in no time.
3703000	3707000	But the antibiotic I'm on now is the slowest one I've ever taken and it was more expensive
3707000	3711000	than C.Pro or any of the other ones I've taken before that are just fine.
3711000	3714000	And I know you're not supposed to take the same antibiotic because then you build up
3714000	3716000	an antibiotic blah blah blah.
3716000	3721000	Yeah, we just now have an insurance-resistant bacteria.
3721000	3722000	Is that it?
3722000	3723000	Leptixim?
3723000	3724000	Is that it?
3724000	3725000	I don't know what the hell it's called.
3725000	3726000	I can't remember.
3726000	3729000	So F.U. to my slow antibiotics.
3729000	3732000	And that's all my F.Us of the week.
3732000	3734000	Now you can go, Jamie.
3734000	3735000	Okay.
3735000	3737000	Well, I love Sega.
3737000	3741000	I mean, if you don't love Sega, you probably have something wrong with your head.
3741000	3748000	So, um, this is good news for people is that Sega Superstars Tennis will be a week early.
3748000	3753000	It was supposed to be on March 20th and it's going to be out a week before that.
3753000	3758000	So you have minigames and basically it's Virtua Tennis.
3758000	3764000	It has achievements on Xbox 360 that are named after older Sega games.
3764000	3770000	And you can play as a bunch of the Sega feet.
3770000	3774000	So that's pretty cool.
3774000	3777000	Cool.
3777000	3781000	You know, actually, it's kind of interesting.
3781000	3787000	Nolan Bushnell, you might remember him for making the game Pong, among other things.
3787000	3793000	And he is now working on an MMO-based title.
3793000	3798000	No real clear answer on what exactly he's working on.
3798000	3805000	They're going to be competing, obviously, with World of Warcraft.
3805000	3813000	It's unavoidable that the social and massively multiplayer games have become important.
3813000	3818000	Basically, I don't know, very vague on what he's working on.
3818000	3821000	So, new multiplayer game, cool.
3821000	3823000	What it is, no idea.
3823000	3826000	Didn't he, like, retire from the industry or something?
3826000	3828000	And he opened up his restaurant.
3828000	3830000	Nolan Bushnell brought a pizza hand here.
3830000	3832000	Which was Chuck E. Cheese.
3832000	3835000	And so did I.
3835000	3837000	Interesting.
3837000	3840000	He was off the topic and he had stolen the right thing.
3840000	3845000	They joke, though, in the article that it's massively multiplayer online Pong.
3845000	3847000	I doubt that.
3847000	3848000	That would be pretty awesome.
3848000	3851000	I don't think that would be possible.
3851000	3854000	So, the drug is called Levaquin.
3854000	3855000	I looked it up.
3855000	3857000	And I just realized it's non-formulary.
3857000	3858000	That's why I pay it so much.
3858000	3863000	So I see my doctor kind of prescribing me something that doesn't pay too much money for it.
3863000	3865000	Sorry, I just didn't get that out there.
3865000	3868000	Who cares about Pong guys and MMOs?
3868000	3870000	Oh, that Chuck E. Cheese is kind of awesome.
3870000	3872000	Have you been to a Chuck E. Cheese lately?
3872000	3874000	They're really horrible now.
3874000	3876000	Decent salad bar, though.
3876000	3882000	But, you know, when I was little, I had a Chuck E. Cheese that was massive.
3882000	3884000	We had a big theater room.
3884000	3888000	It was this room that looked like a foyer to the bathroom that had glowing walls and shit.
3888000	3890000	It had hands and feet on the walls that would clap.
3890000	3892000	And it had a party room with hippopotamus chicken.
3892000	3896000	Have you ever been to Bullwinkle's in the Bay Area?
3896000	3897000	No.
3897000	3900000	It's like the old school Chuck E. Cheese.
3900000	3903000	At least, I hope it still is.
3903000	3906000	Last time I was there, which was a long time ago, it still was.
3906000	3913000	And these were when Chuck E. Cheese was starting to do the new super neon edgy Chuck E. Cheese shit.
3913000	3918000	It was still like the 1980s Chuck E. Cheese Bullwinkle.
3918000	3921000	But they have a little section where you can sit down.
3921000	3928000	And they have almost like one of those mini Vegas water show things where they have the fountain doing a little choreography and stuff like that.
3928000	3929000	Awesome.
3929000	3930000	That's pretty cool.
3930000	3938000	I don't know how big Bullwinkle's of a chain they are, but, you know, I guess Rocky and Bullwinkle aren't that popular.
3938000	3941000	I kind of want to go check it out now.
3941000	3943000	That'd be pretty cool.
3943000	3945000	Let me see if they're still even open.
3945000	3948000	Of course, there's always John's incredibly shitty pizza.
3948000	3950000	You know what? I like some of his pizza.
3950000	3953000	No, I know. It's a funny name. It's not a bad place.
3953000	3956000	But I really like having rice inside of a place.
3956000	3957000	That is pretty fun.
3957000	3960000	Anyhow, one thing I like seeing inside a place is Street Fighter IV.
3960000	3962000	Unfortunately, I haven't seen any yet.
3962000	3964000	But if you live in some places, they have been popping up.
3964000	3971000	And over at Wired.com, they did a pretty lengthy piece on Street Fighter IV's nostalgic allure, is what they called it.
3971000	3979000	But one interesting portion of it talked about that there is a possibility if and when there's console versions,
3979000	3982000	possibly that some other characters may come in.
3982000	3984000	You don't say bonus characters and console versions.
3984000	3985000	We haven't seen that before.
3985000	3987000	But who they name is very interesting.
3987000	3992000	Sakura could come over from Street Fighter Alpha or Ibuki from Street Fighter III.
3992000	3994000	So that would be kind of interesting.
3994000	3996000	Why not both?
3996000	3997000	Why not both?
3997000	4001000	Or do the old one on the Xbox, one on the PlayStation 3. That's always fun.
4001000	4004000	I miss the old times unlock stuff.
4004000	4005000	I thought that was cool.
4005000	4010000	Because when I told the story before, I used to work for an AMCO arcade.
4010000	4013000	And when we had Tekken 3, that would be like, who's next?
4013000	4015000	And have an outline of them.
4015000	4019000	Because I was keeping up with the overseas releases.
4019000	4022000	I would come back and tell my boss who is next.
4022000	4025000	And I found that they switched the order for the US version.
4025000	4026000	Interesting.
4026000	4028000	So it was pretty funny.
4028000	4035000	I hope that if they're going to have release characters in this, they do something like that.
4035000	4041000	So you sort of have to guess who it is or anticipate something that would add a little bit more excitement to it.
4041000	4042000	You know what I mean?
4042000	4049000	Well, some new characters are already being spotted in Street Fighter IV arcade machines that are out there in the wild in the testing regions.
4049000	4057000	And Sagat and Balrog have now shown up in the game to only add bosses like old school Street Fighter II who cannot select them on the main select screen.
4057000	4059000	So, kind of interesting.
4059000	4063000	And by Balrog, it's who we had in Vega over here.
4063000	4068000	I'm not sure because I believe it is Boxer Balrog.
4068000	4072000	Because one of these machines I believe is in North America and that's one of the games that's in Street Fighter IV.
4072000	4073000	And Sagat?
4073000	4074000	Yeah.
4074000	4076000	I was looking at the little video.
4076000	4078000	No, if you're right, it's the US version.
4078000	4082000	So unfortunately, the link will just close down apparently.
4082000	4092000	It got converted into a night club called the Backbeat in late 1990s and it was closed in the mid 2000s.
4092000	4095000	It was in Santa Clara, California.
4095000	4099000	Animatronic animals are not really high-end of animals.
4099000	4103000	There are some restaurants outside of California.
4103000	4117000	There's one in Wilsonville, Oregon, Cary, North Carolina, Richmond, Virginia, Miamiburg, Ohio, and early North Carolina.
4117000	4119000	Hey, it was a cool place.
4119000	4120000	It was pretty awesome.
4120000	4123000	They had a ton of cool stuff there.
4123000	4131000	Also, just want to say really quickly, all those screenshots you can see in Street Fighter IV, they all seem like they're in that upgraded version of the Chun-Li phase.
4131000	4133000	So there are some of the battle locations out there.
4133000	4134000	Here's what's showing up.
4134000	4140000	A drive-in at night, a beautiful day in South Asia, and an inland jungle in South America.
4140000	4143000	So some more battle regions are showing up.
4143000	4146000	I was looking at the movie that's up.
4146000	4151000	It's the Sagat versus UNDF and just watching how fluid it is.
4151000	4152000	It's really cute.
4152000	4157000	It really looks like it's captured a lot of the old feel of the older games.
4157000	4158000	I'm excited.
4158000	4161000	I'll definitely be checking this out when it comes out.
4161000	4162000	Arcade and console.
4162000	4164000	Now please let me know that I'm not at all excited about.
4164000	4165000	What's that?
4165000	4167000	It's Road Rash.
4167000	4169000	Because I hate Road Rash.
4169000	4171000	But my husband loves Road Rash.
4171000	4190000	So there has been a little bit let out that the Electronic Arts CEO is talking about doing another Road Rash, which is basically a game where your own motorcycles beat each other up.
4190000	4196000	Like we had that scene in Final Fantasy VII, where you go and beat people up.
4196000	4197000	Yeah, get in a Road Rash.
4197000	4200000	I remember that.
4200000	4206000	So someone actually let a few things slip about it coming out.
4206000	4209000	And that was actually in Road Sebastian Box.
4209000	4219000	At a classic metal show, he said that one of his recent songs is going to be in...
4219000	4222000	And to quote Ashley said, it's a super heavy song.
4222000	4224000	It just got picked up for some video game.
4224000	4229000	Road Rage or Road Rash or something like that.
4229000	4234000	Dude, who would have thought that a big scoop in gaming would have come from Sebastian Bach?
4234000	4242000	And EA actually said that Road Rash is not currently in development.
4242000	4246000	But Road Rage, that's a whole different story.
4246000	4252000	Sebastian Bach is posturing me because he was rich.
4252000	4253000	He did do a good rest.
4253000	4255000	Probably not deep.
4255000	4259000	And actually, it also is coming to the PlayStation Store as well.
4259000	4261000	It's from Capcom.
4261000	4266000	And it looks like it's going to be available for 800 Microsoft points or $10
4266000	4270000	or just $10 of real money on the PlayStation Network.
4270000	4272000	I haven't heard too much about this game.
4272000	4274000	It doesn't look that great.
4274000	4277000	But I don't know.
4277000	4281000	Tread them, at least.
4281000	4283000	All right.
4283000	4286000	This story is so cruel.
4286000	4287000	I don't know.
4287000	4290000	I feel like these parents, there's going to be a special place in hell for them.
4290000	4292000	But apparently, here's what's happened.
4292000	4294000	There's this YouTube floating around.
4294000	4299000	And there's this kid who got so excited because on Christmas Day,
4299000	4305000	he opened up his presents under the tree and he got an Xbox 360.
4305000	4308000	But unfortunately, here's what happened.
4308000	4314000	The Xbox 360 just was a box that was stuffed with clothes.
4314000	4317000	So the kid got clothes in an Xbox 360 box.
4317000	4320000	Yes, there is video.
4320000	4321000	This is so cruel.
4321000	4323000	I actually haven't even watched it.
4323000	4324000	He's all excited.
4324000	4326000	It makes you want to cry.
4326000	4327000	Poor kid.
4327000	4329000	He opens up the thing.
4329000	4332000	He's like, oh, my God.
4332000	4334000	Xbox 360.
4334000	4336000	Hell, yeah.
4336000	4340000	Of course, I love you anyways, though.
4340000	4342000	Oh, I'm going to open it up.
4342000	4344000	He's so excited.
4344000	4350000	Are you serious?
4350000	4358000	This is so wrong.
4358000	4367000	I forget which blog, but they suggested a pile of parenting books shaped like a car.
4367000	4368000	And they're all laughing.
4368000	4372000	And the parents are laughing at the kid.
4372000	4377000	And we wonder why our kids end up so screwed up in school.
4377000	4379000	That's fucked up.
4379000	4380000	But it is very fucked up.
4380000	4382000	I don't know if you've heard about the news on this.
4382000	4387000	In Gadget, they've offered to find the kid and they're going to give him a real life box 360.
4387000	4390000	If he gets emancipated.
4390000	4393000	I threw the last part in there, but seriously.
4393000	4395000	That's fucked up.
4395000	4399000	This kid's going to be in the news later on after playing the Xbox 360.
4399000	4404000	Later on, he's going to kill his parents in the middle of the night because, you know, they're fucked up.
4404000	4407000	And she's like, oh, I can't afford an Xbox 360.
4407000	4414000	Yet you're an asshole enough to go out there and find an empty Xbox 360 box to fill clothes with.
4414000	4416000	And they put it on the internet.
4416000	4418000	Oh, that's just fucked up.
4418000	4423000	Ag Def says, man, those parents are douches.
4423000	4426000	Frisbee says, look at me, I'm a big man, I can laugh at my own kid.
4426000	4428000	Ha ha ha ha.
4428000	4429000	Jamie, you're being awfully quiet.
4429000	4431000	I know you got a comment.
4431000	4434000	What do you think?
4434000	4435000	Disgusting.
4435000	4436000	Yeah.
4436000	4441000	I don't think there's anything at all funny about it.
4441000	4444000	That's just really disgusting.
4444000	4450000	This is why we have kids that are just like, go to school and be done shit.
4450000	4451000	You know?
4451000	4453000	Because their parents teach it to them.
4453000	4455000	I mean, what's a kid gonna think?
4455000	4458000	Seriously, my parents are assholes, that's what you're gonna think.
4458000	4464000	I mean, unless they just punked him with this and then like, you know, gave him the Xbox, you know, afterwards.
4464000	4466000	You know, like pretend to always can't afford it.
4466000	4473000	That's what I'm wondering is that maybe there's a second half where he actually got the Xbox later that none of us are seeing, but I don't know.
4473000	4475000	I doubt it.
4475000	4476000	Still.
4476000	4477000	Still.
4477000	4479000	All right.
4479000	4485000	So that's all I have to say on that story.
4485000	4490000	Well, that's just, I mean, I really am absolutely disgusted by that.
4490000	4493000	I mean, really disgusted by that.
4493000	4497000	Anyway, in happier moods, I should say.
4497000	4511000	Penny Arcade is, they announced that Penny Arcade Xbox X is going to be August 21st, 2008 with the DigiPen Institute of Technology.
4511000	4520000	So they're looking for ten independent developers that are being viewed by attendees and media and publishers.
4520000	4538000	And there's actually a panel of 50, I guess, industry top people who will be selecting the ten submissions they consider going to be the best based on gameplay and fun factor.
4538000	4542000	And there's also going to be one that the audience gets to vote on.
4542000	4545000	An Audience Choice Award.
4545000	4546000	That's kind of a neat idea.
4546000	4550000	I like the whole idea of bringing some independent stuff to the forefront.
4550000	4551000	It's pretty nice.
4551000	4552000	Yeah.
4552000	4553000	Props to these folks.
4553000	4557000	I would love to go to Penny Arcade Expo someday.
4557000	4559000	Maybe this will be my year.
4559000	4560000	Who knows?
4560000	4561000	We'll see.
4561000	4562000	I'll try.
4562000	4563000	All right.
4563000	4564000	We're going to open up the Skype line very soon.
4564000	4566000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4566000	4569000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4569000	4573000	But first, one more story.
4573000	4578000	I know this story is going to come as a shock to people.
4578000	4584000	If it's seriously breaking news, folks, you're going to want to listen in.
4584000	4586000	There's been a study.
4586000	4593000	A study has been done that shows men like video games.
4593000	4594000	Shocking, I know.
4594000	4596000	You don't say.
4596000	4598000	Absolutely shocking.
4598000	4604000	There's been a study, research that has been done by Frank N.
4604000	4607000	Looks like a legit associate.
4607000	4614000	I thought men like fixed cars and went to baseball games and that's what men did.
4614000	4617000	I always thought video games were like a female thing.
4617000	4621000	Didn't Oprah bring video games on her show and stuff?
4621000	4623000	I don't know.
4623000	4624000	Interesting.
4624000	4636000	It says, you know, apparently the study of 1,864 Americans showed that among males, overall
4636000	4641000	console gaming came in third behind using the internet and watching TV.
4641000	4646000	I might have the internet and TV for both watching porn.
4646000	4652000	Among males 12 to 34, console gaming came in first and then dropped dramatically in
4652000	4653000	older demographics.
4653000	4658000	I've been playing games until I die.
4658000	4663000	The research shows women overall would rather talk on the phone, watch the DVD, listen to
4663000	4666000	music or read a book before playing console games.
4666000	4669000	Oh, no.
4669000	4675000	There is an odd spike among 18 to 24-year-old females for console gaming.
4675000	4680000	Three web-based games did better with females, particularly among women of mature age.
4680000	4683000	No real shocking revelations, of course.
4683000	4686000	Act-deaf-con-chat says, LOL stereotypes.
4686000	4689000	It makes me want to go play some fucking Half-Life.
4689000	4693000	Son-of-tat says, where was masturbation on the list?
4693000	4696000	That must have been number four.
4696000	4699000	No, that just is included with all the topics.
4699000	4704000	Yeah, you have to understand, they do everything alphabetically, so it's mad and then masturbation.
4704000	4709000	Janai says, read a book, read a book.
4709000	4712000	It's almost like reading a book.
4712000	4718000	I'm thinking that there's probably a lot of women out there who like video games, too,
4718000	4721000	and I think there's also a lot of men who don't like video games.
4721000	4723000	I know that might be a shock to some people.
4723000	4727000	All right, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4727000	4728000	His name is Skype.
4728000	4729000	Orange Mountain Radio.
4729000	4731000	But first, we have some voicemails to catch up on.
4731000	4735000	Sometimes when we're not live, some of the folks who like to listen to our podcasts and
4735000	4737000	so on, they like to leave us voicemails.
4737000	4742000	So, we want to get some of those out of the way real quick, so I'm going to start with this one.
4742000	4744000	Hi, guys.
4744000	4750000	I don't have a screening on your forum, but I'm known as Bezineater on the PlayStation Network,
4750000	4756000	and I'm also known as De'arra on Final Fantasy XI.
4756000	4759000	I just want to say to you guys, that's a great show.
4759000	4764000	I test it every week, and I think it has a couple of questions to you.
4764000	4773000	First of all, if you're going to see any kind of rumors, it's equal to Final Fantasy XI,
4773000	4779000	and if you provide any details, if you know any.
4779000	4766380	Secondly, I heard that
4783000	4786000	survival is a really great game and whatnot.
4786000	4790000	We have something like 20 million players, give or take.
4790000	4795000	But the thing is, though, I want to play it, but I don't have PC.
4795000	4802000	Is there any sense in how that he'll be coming to consoles anytime soon,
4802000	4806000	specifically PlayStation 3?
4806000	4814000	If he does, it'll be great, because right now my button-ups and my modes are really limited.
4814000	4818000	Any insights you guys have would be great. Thank you.
4818000	4821000	Thank you very much for the voicemail.
4821000	4826000	I'm thinking that where you're getting the impression that developers are working on the sequel
4826000	4831000	is because it has come out that the people behind Final Fantasy XI, that team, is working on another MMO,
4831000	4833000	but it hasn't been said what it is they're working on.
4833000	4836000	I think a lot of people are assuming it's Final Fantasy XI too,
4836000	4840000	but I honestly think if they are going to make another MMO,
4840000	4844000	it's not going to be Final Fantasy XIV or any of that.
4844000	4849000	They may make a new MMO with some of the same concepts, but I don't know.
4849000	4852000	Would it sell as well without a Final Fantasy name? I don't know.
4852000	4855000	A Kingdom Hearts MMO? Maybe. Who knows.
4855000	4858000	But there's nothing out there concrete at this time.
4858000	4864000	You can probably bet that they'll try to crank at least one more expansion out of Final Fantasy XI before it's done.
4864000	4869000	I know some people said this last one that came out, the...
4869000	4874000	the Prime one, not Precious of Honor again, but the one that just came out. Why can't I remember the name?
4874000	4876000	Williams of the Goddess?
4876000	4878000	Thank you very much. Williams of the Goddess.
4878000	4880000	A lot of people said this in the last one. I don't know.
4880000	4885000	I think if they did like 12 expansions forever, but I think they could get at least one more out of this, I think.
4885000	4890000	At least to hold the Final Fantasy XI fans over until the real sequel comes out, but I don't know.
4890000	4897000	Nothing concrete isn't said. Anything you hear out there is speculation alone.
4897000	4900000	One more voice mail for you guys.
4927000	4930000	I miss you guys. It was a plus.
4930000	4934000	Oh, and here's what I did on Sunday since I couldn't listen.
4934000	4940000	I... I had an equation set up at the clock and I said it was eight my time.
4940000	4948000	So I threw a random episode in my playlist and listened to it like I was listening to it.
4948000	4955000	I... I can't really recall the episode number up here, but it was fucking hilarious.
4955000	4961000	I'm thinking he has the reverse cage match in it.
4961000	4963000	This show's never coming.
4963000	4966000	I'm sure many of you know what it is.
4966000	4971000	I'm kind of paranoid that somebody's going to jack my computer while I'm not looking.
4971000	4977000	So I'm going to go ahead and say bye and with luck I should see you all on Sunday. Bye!
4977000	4979000	Couple comments from chat. Rama says,
4979000	4981000	Sounds like she's walking and talking. I kind of agree.
4981000	4985000	Sj100matt says, Is Misty the first PSP Sky caller? I believe she is.
4985000	4988000	I was trying to be number one, but I had the wrong...
4988000	4991000	You got beat!
4991000	4995000	No, that's definitely one reason I wanted to play that is because that would be the first PSP call we've gotten.
4995000	4997000	So there you have it.
4997000	4999000	Unless she was lying.
4999000	5000000	No, I don't think she's lying.
5000000	5003000	Because it came through with her name. She definitely made that call on Skype.
5003000	5006000	And from the way it sounded, she was definitely outdoors. She was not by a computer.
5006000	5008000	That was pretty bad quality for her.
5008000	5011000	Yeah, it wasn't bad quality for a call.
5011000	5015000	A. I think it's cute she was nerdy. I love it when people get nervous and they don't know what to say.
5015000	5019000	Because I'm like, we're just dumb kids like all the rest of you, so I don't know why.
5019000	5022000	But I guess sometimes it's hard when you're not getting the feedback.
5022000	5027000	Or at least our live callers get that live feedback where we can kind of tell them.
5027000	5030000	But yeah, I think that's really neat that she puts on the old episodes.
5030000	5032000	We do need to release more of the old episodes.
5032000	5036000	One of those projects I'll never get to.
5036000	5039000	Anyhow, let's open up the Skypline for all y'all.
5039000	5041000	It's now wide open for everybody to call in.
5041000	5047000	Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5047000	5048000	username on Skype once again.
5048000	5050000	Orange Lounge Radio.
5050000	5055000	And after we do the Skypline tonight, we'll be getting some last minute phone calls.
5055000	5059000	Not last minute phone calls, last minute stories.
5059000	5060000	I've been doing this far too long.
5060000	5062000	Last minute stories you need?
5062000	5063000	Yeah.
5063000	5065000	Let's go ahead and take a call.
5065000	5067000	Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
5067000	5068000	Legend of Dr.
5068000	5071000	I love Legend of Dr. What's on your mind?
5071000	5076000	Nah, just chillin' right here recovering from the heat that I got from clubbin' like a saint.
5076000	5079000	But that's besides the point.
5079000	5091000	Just wanted to probably point out the whole clusterfuck that Nintendo has created as a result of their attempts to create an online multiplayer.
5091000	5093000	What is your thoughts on that?
5093000	5095000	It's just bullshit, man. It's not bad.
5095000	5108000	I mean, it's bad enough when people like me have to wait in front of like 10, 20, 30 guys outside of Nintendo World every morning just to get the school week.
5108000	5119000	And then, you know, if you take it home, you realize that, you know, there's barely an online multiplayer experience to begin with.
5119000	5122000	But what about the children, Daku? What about the children?
5122000	5127000	Well, that's playing through the Disney book. You know, the soccer mom book.
5127000	5128000	But, you know...
5128000	5130000	Who is buying Wii's, Daku? Soccer mom?
5130000	5133000	Of course. That's the demographic.
5133000	5151000	And they're playing the Disney card because, you know, think about what would happen, you know, if someone were to catch them off guard by trying to do something that allowed, you know, the other players to basically, you know, to curse in a magic standard like they do on Xbox Live.
5151000	5153000	It would be a shit-toll.
5153000	5158000	You know, Xbox News, for example, would just, you know, spin the shit out of the Wii image.
5158000	5166000	The dark side of the Nintendo Wii, where these young children are being, their eyes are being raped by the hideous voice chat inside Mario Kart Wii.
5166000	5170000	How do these raise your children tonight on Fox?
5170000	5181000	If you're basically playing Mario Kart, you know, with voice chat or anything like that, you know, the only thing I'm worried about is ad-hoc.
5181000	5185000	And, you know, ad-hoc is just ruining the experience for everyone.
5185000	5197000	But at the same time, you know, it's like, if you put the right security measures on it, like, you know, I am totally fine with Nintendo saying, no communication between strangers, period.
5197000	5207000	But with the whole Franco thing, you know, I would think that, you know, once you have the Franco, then you should be able, if you want to say fucking shit, you should be able to do that.
5207000	5221000	Right, I mean, I don't know. I guess that kind of, you know, that kind of goes, you know, kind of basically takes away, if not, you know, goes in a different direction in terms of, you know, the typical matchmaking done on other places.
5221000	5228000	Yeah, I mean, yeah, that might be one thing, but I don't know if it'd be enough to throw the fuse or something.
5228000	5230000	Okay, quick question, Zach, and quick question, then we gotta wrap up.
5230000	5244000	G.S. 68 says, and he's quoting something he said earlier in chat, he said, you say the Xbox Live, they say, you know, N-I-G, blah, blah, blah, F-A, blah, blah, blah, and all that they say on Xbox Live, yet you bitch about Nintendo's online.
5244000	5250000	So, what's the answer? Because Xbox is too much, Nintendo is not enough. What's the answer?
5250000	5268000	I don't know, I mean, look, think about it. I mean, you can mute, in Xbox Live, I know you can mute people, right, and even though Nintendo is basically doing the mute for you, you don't even have that option to sign with other, like, rude, obnoxious players.
5268000	5283000	I mean, it's just basically, it's boiled down to a Disney-type level, where it's just, you know, this is what you can't, you know, these are the phrases you can't, you know, you can't say, and they just, you know, they can only work.
5283000	5294000	Okay, here's my last question for you, Zachu. As much as you or I may hate to admit it, is this change, is this revelation about the online thing and Mario Kart online, is it gonna affect sales?
5294000	5303000	I doubt it. I mean, most people, I mean, you know, most people won't leave it, and I doubt that many people even take advantage of all, you know, the online features anyways.
5303000	5313000	I mean, some will, but I think of Mario Kart as something you would share amongst friends, you know, with food and liquor and stuff like that.
5313000	5323000	And it's not just a social video game conference, that's, you know, that's ahead of the fields of your audience and the 360 and PS3 combined.
5323000	5332000	Right. I think you are right, Zachu. I don't think it's gonna affect sales at all. We gotta let you go, Zachu. Thank you so much for the call. Good to hear from you.
5332000	5336000	I hope you heard the bonus statement tonight, by the way. There was some very exciting news for you in there.
5336000	5344000	1-877-GAMEL, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
5344000	5346000	Hi, this is Act Deaf in Chat.
5346000	5349000	Hi, Act Deaf in Chat. How are you? What's on your mind, buddy?
5349000	5360000	Just talking about, everyone talk about the thing you talked about in the bonus segment about the March Madness, the DMN is urbanizing?
5360000	5365000	Yes, and just so our podcast listeners know, since they don't always get to hear the bonus statement, because we do something bonus.
5365000	5374000	DMN, one of our weeknight shows, I believe there's a show on Wednesdays, The Insanest Hour, he is putting together the top 64.
5374000	5380000	He's doing this March Madness thing with the 64 games, going face-off against each other, all the listeners submitted in their list.
5380000	5383000	And during the bonus segment tonight, the hosts voted on their favorite.
5383000	5386000	So that being said, I just want to get some background there, Act Deaf. What did you want to say on that?
5386000	5399000	You and Loki made a vote for one of the brackets. It was Ocarina of Time and Derby Superstar.
5399000	5400000	Yes.
5400000	5410000	I want to say that I'm with you. So not for the same reason, but just because I do think that Derby Superstar is a better game than Ocarina of Time.
5410000	5415000	Yeah, here's the thing. Loki and I made a controversial vote during the bonus segment and this whole thing.
5415000	5427000	We voted for Kirby Superstar over Ocarina of Time, and both of us said it's because basically we both agree that Ocarina of Time is one of the most, by the gaming community in general, overrated games there is.
5427000	5430000	I've tried playing it and I can't stand it.
5430000	5434000	When Zelda wins 3D for me, it just didn't work.
5434000	5440000	Even Wind Waker, or not Wind Waker. Wind Waker is fine. I like Wind Waker and I like Zelda for the DS.
5440000	5443000	But I don't like, you know...
5443000	5446000	It's not that I think it's a bad game.
5446000	5457000	I don't care for the more mature looking Link. I don't like the 3D ones that are on Nintendo 64 and I didn't really get into...
5457000	5463000	And I just love the Super Nintendo ones so, so much. It's one of my favorite games of all time. Seriously.
5463000	5479000	Maybe it's not solid talking but for me Kirby Superstar is the better game there because Kirby Superstar is like many games in one. Many adventure games, also multiplayer games.
5479000	5494000	And basically, although the story in it, or many stories in it, aren't as deep as Ocarina of Time, so you can have a better time playing it.
5494000	5500000	And even replaying it, like Great Table Planet is one of the games there.
5500000	5505000	It's basically an adventure game that you find treasures.
5505000	5516000	I think there's like 100 treasures you have to find and it's very difficult to do it in one simple run. You have to replay it again and again to get there.
5516000	5521000	Act out, but maybe you just want to admit that maybe a little bit you're just a Kirby fanboy.
5521000	5528000	Maybe. So, I do like Ocarina of Time and maybe it's one of my favorite games of all time but...
5528000	5535000	I just want to make that point that maybe Ocarina of Time is not that great of a game.
5535000	5539000	It's not all that in a bag of chips.
5539000	5548000	I'm sure there's many people out there that disagree, but you know what? That's the reason I love doing this show is because everybody has a different opinion.
5548000	5555000	And we have ours and I'm sure many of you have been asked in emails we did this week about how we hate Ocarina of Time. It isn't true. We like it.
5555000	5558000	Yeah, different strokes for different people.
5558000	5560000	Exactly. If you want to put it that way, then fine.
5560000	5564000	Alright, Act out any other comments you have for our listeners tonight.
5564000	5571000	I want to say that I already got my ticket for video games live, so in two weeks I'm going to see it.
5571000	5574000	Will we expect a full report?
5574000	5575000	You will.
5575000	5578000	Alright, sounds good. Take care Act out, have fun with video games live. We don't talk to you before that.
5578000	5579000	Same.
5579000	5586000	If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call. 877-GAMELAR.
5586000	5589000	The call's coming back to back tonight. Hi, Aaron. Who's this?
5589000	5590000	Hey, hey, it's Ronald.
5590000	5599000	Wow, you got through. What do you own in Zaku and Raven's Dolphin? What is it that you guys have to get you in the chat before anybody else?
5599000	5600000	A fast trigger finger.
5600000	5604000	I guess so. You guys are good. Alright, well what's on your mind, Ronald?
5604000	5621000	Well, a couple of things about the whole of Nintendo online thing. Well, I don't blame them for setting up the preset text chat and all that, but when friends get together and play, it is the most rowdy-ness ever.
5621000	5630000	I mean, really, if I'm going to play Mario Kart Wii online with my friends, I'm left to curse like a sailor. I want to say this, I want to say that.
5630000	5631000	Me too.
5631000	5633000	Yes, I would.
5633000	5644000	Me too. The weird thing is that thanks to technology, I'm still going to do that, whether it be this whole Ventrilo thing or the, I love the idea of, I think it was even Loki or Chatter that said it.
5644000	5651000	You sign on to the Xbox 360 and do your chat on the 360 and then play the Wii.
5651000	5659000	Well, for me, I'll just bring my laptop next to the Wii and I'll just put my headset on and just like, everyone goes back there. Let's just go, you know?
5659000	5667000	Do you think maybe that's it? Do you think Nintendo maybe knows that, you know what, those people don't fucking care. They're all about, you know, coddling the family to make sure.
5667000	5669000	I'm just trying to be double-degged.
5669000	5676000	I think it tends to be on the fact that they're a quote-unquote family company, family gaming console and stuff like that, you know?
5676000	5679000	They're scared shitless about online is what it is.
5679000	5685000	It's pretty genuine chat, but it's more fun when it's multiplayer offline.
5685000	5702000	Honestly, when I get Mario Kart Wii, I'm going to be too busy hosting racing parties at my house and trying to get my Wii online and sit in a lobby, call my friends and get into the chat room and to the lobby where we can all play together.
5702000	5707000	You know what though, I gotta say though, Janine, sometimes that's not an option though.
5707000	5716000	You know, one of the beautiful things about the internet is that it brings you together. One reason I'm so obsessed with WoW to the point you guys make fun of me over it is that I get to play with some of my friends I don't see on a regular basis.
5716000	5723000	For instance, one of my closest friends lives in Kansas, so we play that way and we also have a guy in our guild who's from Idaho who's hilarious.
5723000	5729000	And yeah, there's a bunch of local people on there too, but we have a good time, you know, just laughing and playing the game and all that.
5729000	5741000	You know, a lot of our listeners, you know, we get to play games on DS sometimes, I get to play with people in New York City and all that stuff. So, you know, sometimes the internet really helps fill in that void and you can't have people on the couch.
5741000	5742000	True, true.
5742000	5745000	Alright, any other thoughts, Rambo, before I let you go?
5745000	5750000	Yeah, a couple of things, but number one, remember when you said earlier about a Hello Kitty PlayStation 3?
5750000	5751000	Yes.
5751000	5754000	I thought you had a thing for Batch Maroon.
5754000	5764000	It is the Batch Maroon thing, not a Hello Kitty thing, but I've just accepted the fact that people are just going to loop it all in the same thing and when I say Batch Maroon is Sanrio, they're going to go, oh, you like Hello Kitty.
5764000	5768000	Plus there's the whole fact that I have the toaster and the coffee maker, which doesn't help.
5768000	5776000	They don't make, like, if they came out with a Batch Maroon toaster, I would sell that thing, my Hello Kitty wanted to garage sale so quick and replace it, but they just, they don't do it.
5776000	5778000	No love for penguins.
5778000	5785000	So does my sister, they had the Hello Kitty AR-15 that came back.
5785000	5788000	You know, I was surprised no one got me the waffle maker for Christmas.
5788000	5794000	So many people said they were going to give me the waffle maker, but it was one of those things where I think no one wanted to buy it because they all thought everyone else was getting it.
5794000	5797000	Which is funny.
5797000	5811000	And before I go, when I went to chapter five a couple of weeks ago, a couple of interesting things. Number one, in the game room, they had a 32 inch HDTV set up, went to the Atari 7800, playing Mario Brothers.
5811000	5824000	That's fucking hardcore. You know, I have to admit, I have to admit, when I was at the record store this weekend that also sells the old games, and I saw some of the games that they had on the 2600, like combat and warlords and all that stuff.
5824000	5832000	And I was like, man, how fun would it be just for one day to hook up the Atari 2600 games to the TV, the big HDTV, and just have a brawl.
5832000	5833000	Brawl.
5833000	5834000	What?
5834000	5835000	Come over.
5835000	5837000	We'll hook up the 5200.
5837000	5839000	Let's just TV that shit.
5839000	5847000	I want to actually have the 5200 hooked up because even though the controllers broke really easily, I would totally love to get like a Kix game going on.
5847000	5850000	Oh, good times.
5850000	5852000	I want some epic Kaboom.
5852000	5854000	Actually, not a game, I really love.
5854000	5856000	I want some HD Kaboom.
5856000	5859000	I love kangaroo.
5859000	5860000	We need to do that one weekend.
5860000	5861000	And leave us.
5861000	5865000	I think one weekend, we need to just marathon the shit out of old school Atari games.
5865000	5869000	Why don't we do this? How about twice a month, or you know, we can manage the time.
5869000	5873000	We pick an old console, hook that shit up and play it.
5873000	5875000	You're talking old console, or you're talking twice a month.
5875000	5878000	You're talking about my, you know, vault in my house.
5878000	5879000	Yeah, I know.
5879000	5880000	It does need to get played.
5880000	5881000	It does.
5881000	5884000	I think we can do it for click-a-vision and television.
5884000	5888000	Let's make it happen. Let's not let this go the way the Super Metroid thinks.
5888000	5890000	We set a time, we set a date, and we do it.
5890000	5893000	I bring it over to Justin's TV cam so the chatters can enjoy it too.
5893000	5895000	We'll point it at the TV and just go to town.
5895000	5896000	Let's do it.
5896000	5897000	Let's do it. When?
5903000	5909000	Okay, we can't set a time right now because we have to consult our calendars, but Rama, you're in charge of bitching at us until it happens.
5909000	5911000	Well, this isn't early April.
5911000	5912000	All right.
5912000	5913000	We will do.
5913000	5914000	We have to wait that long?
5914000	5915000	Well, because I'm not able to do with content.
5915000	5916000	Oh, that's right.
5916000	5919000	And I'm getting shot in the head next, not just right at the neck.
5919000	5922000	All right, so Rama, you stay on our asses until it happens, all right?
5922000	5924000	That's what I will do.
5924000	5925000	All right.
5925000	5926000	We gotta let you go, Rama.
5926000	5929000	All right, most of our game is in the game room.
5929000	5930000	My match club is Brawl.
5930000	5934000	Out of all the hot games, everybody was online from Brawl.
5934000	5936000	All my best friends came and were screaming.
5936000	5937000	Oh, my God.
5937000	5938000	Brawl was so good.
5938000	5939000	It was so good.
5939000	5941000	I'm like, dude, relax.
5941000	5942000	Over your room.
5942000	5943000	Change your underwear.
5943000	5945000	Go back to play, okay?
5945000	5946000	Relax.
5946000	5949000	The line was like going all over the place.
5949000	5950000	Yes, you had data.
5950000	5953000	Everybody was there to play Brawl.
5953000	5955000	This game isn't clear.
5955000	5957000	At least 500 copies per se.
5957000	5959000	But you know what?
5959000	5964000	You were looking at Brawl's target audience at that place, you know what I mean?
5964000	5968000	Of course, all the people that go to anime concerts are excited about Brawl.
5968000	5970000	Most of them are Nintendo fanboys.
5970000	5975000	But still, I mean, you have people my age going, let's go to the forest.
5975000	5977000	It's gonna be huge, stellar.
5977000	5978000	I'm not doubting you on that, Rama.
5978000	5979000	It's gonna be huge, stellar.
5979000	5980000	We gotta let you go.
5980000	5981000	This call's going on for very, very long.
5981000	5983000	But thank you so much, as always.
5983000	5984000	Take care, everybody.
5984000	5985000	Sorry.
5985000	5986000	This is getting to seven minutes.
5986000	5989000	I'm trying to keep them at four minutes now.
5989000	5990000	One more call.
5990000	5991000	We're wrapping up.
5991000	5992000	Let's see.
5992000	5993000	How far are we in the show?
5993000	5994000	I think we gotta wrap up.
5994000	5995000	That's just part B.
5995000	5996000	Cause the bonus there.
5996000	5997000	Bonus statement tonight was 15 minutes.
5997000	5998000	It's 9.30 here.
5998000	5999000	We gotta end this shit.
5999000	6000000	So, that being said, quickly, Loki, any last minute stories?
6000000	6001000	Yes.
6001000	6002000	I have last minute stories for you.
6002000	6003000	Alright.
6003000	6004000	Okay.
6004000	6005000	Lego MMO.
6005000	6006000	We know and love that they have coming out.
6006000	6007000	What's cool about it is if you build stuff in the game, you can actually hit a button,
6007000	6008000	much like you can in Spore, and they will spit out a kit that will actually be shipped
6008000	6009000	to your house where you can build stuff in the game.
6009000	6023000	That's pretty awesome.
6023000	6027000	Wow.
6027000	6030000	That's kinda neat.
6030000	6033000	You don't know Jack has become part of Yahoo Games.
6033000	6036000	Oh, I'm so sad that missed the cut tonight.
6036000	6038000	That is very exciting news.
6038000	6039000	I'm very excited about that.
6039000	6040000	Is it up now?
6040000	6041000	Can you play it?
6041000	6042000	Yes, it is up now.
6042000	6043000	Shut up.
6043000	6044000	I don't know what I'm doing tonight.
6044000	6045000	I'm not sure.
6045000	6051000	Resident Evil Zero is coming to the Wii in Japan to support the GameCube thing and much
6051000	6052000	like...
6052000	6053000	Yeah.
6053000	6054000	Anyway.
6054000	6060240	A Finnish company, or Finnish stopper company, called FutureMark Game Studio has filed papers
6060240	6062240	to trademark pwnage.
6062240	6066000	Yes, they're trying to trademark pwnage.
6066000	6068000	Was they gonna put it on shirts and stuff?
6068000	6070000	I don't know why.
6070000	6071000	Interesting.
6071000	6072000	Let's see.
6072000	6077000	Then, the PlayStation Store is apparently gonna be overhauled in April.
6077000	6083000	It's gonna look more like the Things Store, which, you know, a little different, a little
6083000	6084000	bit easier to navigate.
6084000	6085000	So that's kinda cool.
6085000	6088000	So we'll get for that in April there.
6088000	6093000	And this will be Arcade Stage 4 is headed to PS3.
6093000	6094000	That's pretty cool.
6094000	6095000	Wow.
6095000	6096000	This is not a game I'm gonna be importing, though.
6096000	6097000	I learned my lesson the first time.
6097000	6098000	Did the other Initial D games come out on console?
6098000	6099000	I don't think they ever did.
6099000	6100000	They're not here.
6100000	6101000	Even here.
6101000	6102000	And they have Initial D on the PSP as well.
6102000	6103000	Strange.
6103000	6104000	And lastly...
6104000	6105000	I have a PS3 one.
6105000	6106000	Hmm.
6106000	6116000	Lastly, to piss off people even more, a guy named Vandal had an Xbox 360 which he had
6116000	6121000	signed by team members from the budget staff, Xbox 360 team members.
6121000	6125000	There's even a sketch of Spartans done by the Rooster Teeth guy.
6125000	6132000	Anyways, his 360 died and had the free ring, so he sent it in to get sick.
6132000	6136000	He even, you know, took precautions of asking them, hey, you know, can you send this back
6136000	6137000	to me in the same case?
6137000	6141000	If not, you know, can you make sure you put the new case on the new system?
6141000	6142000	That kind of stuff.
6142000	6144000	Well, he gets it back.
6144000	6150000	Serial numbers match and everything, but they rubbed off the Sharpie, you know, drawing
6150000	6151000	was on the case.
6151000	6152000	It's not a new case.
6152000	6155000	It's actually the old case and they literally rubbed it off.
6155000	6158000	You can see parts where the Sharpie marker is still there.
6158000	6159000	Somebody didn't get the memo.
6159000	6162000	Why would they do that in the first place?
6162000	6164000	Why would you rub something off?
6164000	6169000	I mean, that's just being a dick is what that is.
6169000	6173000	And no one else that didn't make a cut.
6173000	6180000	The singing store is also going to be getting 67 songs in the next update, which I believe
6180000	6182000	is supposed to happen in April as well.
6182000	6187000	The only problem is those 67 songs weren't all the other King Star games, so it's nothing
6187000	6188000	new.
6188000	6193000	Alright, well, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
6193000	6195000	George Parker, we'll start with you tonight.
6195000	6196000	Your final thoughts.
6196000	6197000	Tired.
6197000	6200000	My final thought is wine is good.
6200000	6202000	Plum wine was good.
6202000	6203000	What's your final thought?
