2639	15507	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 2nd of 2008, where we're taping episode number 269 of Orange Lounge Radio live, as we do here every Sunday night, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
15547	18329	In part A, you missed a whole bunch of Sony news.
18349	24393	We talked about Metal Gear Solid 4, some of the new bundles that are coming out, the departure of Phil Harrison, just a lot of that.
24493	27055	Now we're going to get into some Nintendo news in this segment.
27075	29036	Yes, Loki?
29056	29116	Yes.
29736	32278	Now, of course, like most things, you know,
36277	58791	We Date, but that doesn't mean that retailers haven't figured out when it's coming out, including such wonderful websites as Gamefly, GameStop, Circuit City, and I think a few others, have it listed as April 27th, that's two days before Grand Theft Auto 4, and that would also be a Sunday.
60372	61713	Is this going to happen or not?
62433	63094	Who knows?
68963	69563	All right.
70724	73906	Do you think they're doing that to specifically get the jump on Grand Theft Auto 4?
74046	76607	Or is it kind of one of those, eh, I don't really have a clue.
76627	79528	I think they're going to be out of, you know, they need to press them.
79608	82370	They need to have enough time to press those discs.
83330	88613	And also, the other thing that's really going to hamper that game is the production of those fucking wheels.
89953	91414	It's absolutely retarded.
91574	93655	But if you were a bet,
99585	100505	Very good odds on that bet.
100605	101946	All right.
102766	108147	You know, maybe one thing that the game has been put, because it was originally supposed to come out late last year, right?
108167	110528	Wasn't it originally a Christmas release that got put back a little bit?
110548	111868	Something like that, our first quarter?
111908	112208	I don't know.
112468	115669	Well, anyhow, perhaps one reason they pushed it back is because, guess what, guys?
116189	119870	Mario Kart Wii, it looks like Nintendo has finally caught on.
120170	123531	Mario Kart Wii is going to have online chat in it.
124318	125219	It's about time.
125279	127401	I mean, Xbox has been doing this for years, right?
128642	130924	Oh, I see.
131384	134847	Mario Kart Wii will be supporting online text chat.
135527	136068	That's right.
136348	141873	You'll be able to send text messages to your friends over Mario Kart Wii.
141913	146617	Provided that they are on your friends list, you have their friend codes and all that stuff, you will be able to text.
147397	148778	You can do it before matches.
148899	150440	It's assumed you can do it after matches.
166515	169097	or, you know, Good Game and stuff like that.
169637	170738	Oh my god, for real?
171079	171599	For real.
172880	175141	Yeah, it's not like as cool as you would think.
175241	179084	It's their way, I think, of trying to control the game right now.
179525	180926	It's like the Disney MMO.
180986	185869	I'm sorry, the news must have changed slightly since the initial release that IGN did or whatever.
185929	189352	So, okay, so now it's been... It's like the Disney MMOs.
189632	191753	Like, if you've ever played, what is that, Toontown, I think it is?
192093	194195	You only have a list of preselected phrases you can use.
198527	200429	SAD, SAD, SAD
224634	236977	RansteelUT, their names are very similar tonight, I think that's Ranma under another name, RansteelUT says, text chat, better than hearing F-M-G and N-I-M-E-R and all that stuff while playing.
238097	251240	You know, I think that, in one respect I think it's a good idea, you know, because they are trying to make an effort to protect
252000	254061	Their intended group, I should say.
255082	264769	Which was why, you know, Publins just needed the same thing with theirs, because they don't want something with their name on it, for lack of a better description, corrupted by the people playing it, you know.
266210	269112	So, in that way, I think it was smart.
269532	271814	It's just plain waste, damn safe, that's all it is.
272543	279429	Yeah, and Ran still, if he continues in our chatroom, chat.roman.com, but if you're playing online with friends, then you should be allowed to say whatever you want.
279569	289857	You know, I would like to see a mode where, you know, okay, yeah, maybe it's off by default, but maybe I can go in there and turn it on or something, where, you know, if I want to call my friends gay while I'm playing, I should have the right.
289877	293120	Well, here's a thought, I don't know, maybe filter the obscenities.
293580	295482	Oh my god, that's so hard.
295502	299225	It's like, it's stupid is what it is.
300268	308490	It's absolutely stupid that you should jump through all these hoops to just friggin' play the game with your friends, and then after all that stuff, why even include text chat?
309330	314811	You know, basically, as so they can put a big sticker on the box, supports online chat.
315091	323012	As to, yeah, IGN did a report on this, and basically, you know, selected limited selections, automated statements, or responses while playing the game.
323052	326493	Like, hello, I'm sad, I'd say welcome, you know.
327495	332759	RossDLUT asks, and yes, this time it is RossDLUT, asks in chat room, why even make the stupid game online?
333079	336001	Well, you know, for me, it's kind of like the DS games.
336121	340384	I mean, how often do you go on a DS game and somebody is already there online waiting for you?
340404	341104	That doesn't happen.
341384	345667	You prearrange those matches over the internet on AIM, or you prearrange them over the telephone.
345968	350871	So I'm thinking, fire up, guys, there's voice chat.
350951	353413	Okay, here's another thought, and this is the kind of,
355660	356320	Final Fantasy XI
382711	388956	You know, supporting that feature, because this may be also the chat with the other people, not necessarily your friends that you're playing with as well.
389716	395841	I just wish they would also have normal chatting in there as well on top of this stuff, but whatever.
398655	408002	I'm looking at the Justin TV chat for a minute and usually I don't take a chance to read it, but our old buddy Akuma JP is in there and says, type while driving better.
409282	412885	As if talking on your cell phone while driving wasn't bad enough, now you can type while driving.
413966	417748	Hey, well, it's a wee remote, you know, you really only need one hand to kind of do that.
418489	420130	Can I put on my makeup while I drive too?
420730	421071	Alright.
421791	422832	Oh my god, that'd be an awesome one.
429174	432816	Woman driver of the game.
434356	435797	Okay, drag queen driver.
435837	436897	Okay, that's better.
437037	440418	That has to be kind of hot.
440618	444019	You've got to put on your makeup and your stilettos while you're trying to drive.
445600	447260	Put on your furry costume on the way there.
447300	448240	And change the radio.
448320	449881	Hey, Mr. DJ.
449941	450861	There you go.
451121	452202	Can we move on, please?
453062	453122	Um...
454378	462727	Well, something that is actually fairly cool about Mario Kart Wii is that there is an 8-finger fast mode, which is pretty cool.
463568	466912	So, it looks like you'll be able to...
470180	471720	I can't wait for Mario Kart.
471800	474121	I'm more excited about this game than Brawl.
474141	474521	Why is that?
474541	477281	Because I'm not really into the fighting games.
477301	481582	Mario Kart, I love Mario Kart.
481682	485023	I bought every game system or every Nintendo system for Mario Kart.
485043	485883	Wait, even Double Dash?
498601	499961	Yes, I even bought Double Dash.
500461	501722	But did you like Double Dash?
503062	503922	It was okay.
503942	507543	The Battle Mode in Double Dash really sucks balls, but, you know.
507983	510504	Well, sorry, Jamie, but what do you think of 8-Player Battle Mode?
510664	512884	I mean, is that a game-selling thing for you, or?
512904	520626	Well, I was probably going to get it anyway, but I think that that's very cool, especially since I know enough people who have a Wii to facilitate that much play.
522046	523266	I just wish it would, you know.
523546	526807	I was thinking what you could do is have a laptop in with Ventriload.
527935	529135	and then do your snack talking.
530156	530636	That's true.
531136	535478	But, you know, I don't, like, for me, my computer is all the way out here in the dungeon, a.k.a.
535518	536518	garage, a.k.a.
536678	540219	OLR makeshift studio, and then the Wii is all the way in there.
540619	541740	So I can't really do that.
541860	542920	I'm just here for myself.
543100	543800	I've got my laptop.
543840	544981	You've got your MacBook.
545081	545701	Sorry.
563365	567228	Can you come over and set that all up?
568049	569110	There's too many wires.
571231	574013	Maybe I can get the Best Buy people to install it for me.
575214	576595	Here's what I wanted to do.
576635	577496	You were like, huh?
578517	579538	Did we cover that story?
579578	580839	I think it got cut from the show.
582180	590086	At Best Buy, there was a sticker on an Xbox 360 game that said, have Geek Squad install this game on your Xbox 360.
590126	590706	I've seen that.
595725	598567	That's just somebody got sticker happy and put stickers on the wrong things.
598587	601950	That's cool.
602711	608536	Eject, put the game in, drop it down, push eject button again, game goes in.
608576	609557	Okay, that'll be $50.
610698	611038	Nice.
612299	617583	Now, maybe the PlayStation 3 installation, that might be something because it takes so long for some of those games.
618424	621827	Alright, well we'll be battling it out.
621847	622848	That's my full cry.
624466	632188	There's a game that I played a while back, and I think maybe during one of these shows back at our old apartment we were off, but it's a game called Defend Your Castle.
632668	640709	It's a little flash game where you defend your castle against stick figures, and you get archers and all sorts of things to defend them.
641070	647531	And also, basically what you do is you use your mouse to throw the stick figures away to keep them away from your castle.
648051	652752	Well, now this is going to be coming to the WiiWare service as well.
653374	660247	It's actually going to be completely from the ground up, and it's only $5 for 500 Wii Points, which is pretty awesome.
661268	664294	And of course, they've built some new features into it as well.
665196	666578	And apparently, unlimited levels.
671145	673226	That's pretty awesome.
673326	675267	I love games like that.
675447	678168	The old school Atari 2600 games never ended.
678228	678888	Like Kaboom.
679828	681549	It didn't end until something was Kaboom.
681569	683450	There was no ending.
683470	684370	It was going faster.
684390	687851	That's pretty awesome.
687972	694274	Another game that they've already announced coming to the service a while back was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles My Life as a
701915	716362	Wee Point, and we'll be joining some other games as well, including, of course, Defender, Castle, and this one didn't make the list, but the major league eating the game, which looks like a piece of shit, and that will be But that's not what you're eating.
716602	720384	No, it's not a piece of shit that you're eating, but the game looks like looks like pooey.
721104	722665	Like dump on your wee.
723185	725427	No one likes dump on their wee.
725487	728448	I've never heard poo like an adjective, but there you go.
728948	730429	And it's coming out May
732938	738042	I don't know about that, but they need to figure out something with the whole Wii memory shit.
738102	739904	You know, if you can put these on
757710	763054	I would like to think that maybe they can do an upgrade right when the WiiWare comes out and then you can start using flashcards, but who knows.
764343	770468	One thing that Nintendo can get right, though, is the peripherals, I mean, they will crank out those Wii wheels for Mario Kart.
771188	776032	Here's the thing, though, that's kind of weird, is that it will actually be sold separately other places.
776492	783277	Famitsu over in Japan has revealed that Nintendo is going to be selling the Wii wheels separately for about $11.
783658	791063	No word yet if we're going to get that separately as well, but you know that if Nintendo doesn't officially put them out themselves, which they probably will,
791303	794245	You're going to have third-party developers of the Wazoo doing this.
794285	799409	Because it does kind of make sense to have the separate Wii wheels because, you know, the same reason you have separate DDR pads.
799429	800770	Sometimes you want to play two-player.
801671	805173	They will be coming out separately here at the same time as Mario Kart.
805393	805914	Oh, really?
806174	806374	Yes.
806674	807715	And you know this to be fact.
807895	808656	I know.
808676	810157	Well, there you have it then.
810297	814860	And it's the same reason why because little Screaming Billy wants fucking, you know, his own wheel.
814880	817102	He doesn't want to share it with his sister or something like that.
817142	818743	He has to buy two fucking plastic wheels.
819087	823248	They're just plastic wheels, folks, and seriously, you can buy them now.
823368	828009	I mean, just third-party things, and it's completely, absolutely useless.
828129	830150	I mean, you don't need this thing to play the game.
830290	830950	I love this.
830970	832650	This is my favorite comment in a while.
832990	838692	Rob says, guys, save that the DDR pad has functionality and the Wii is a dumbass wheel.
841553	842233	Touche.
843953	844513	Touche.
845153	847514	I just like the fact that this game controls with as many
856957	862279	DarkTsuyu says, I wish there was a wheel that let the Wiimote fit vertically so I could use it on Need for Speed Carbon.
862599	863580	Well, that's the thing, too.
863620	865701	That's the other thing that pisses me off about this game.
865821	875265	If you've ever played one of these games that uses the wheels sideways like Mario Kart does or like, say, like some of these other games that use the wheels, it's really
880363	882485	In related news, I still kinda like Excite Truck.
882525	884667	And they need to fucking make a new one!
900768	903449	My wife has finished the game.
903489	907591	For the love of God, give Loki's wife a game to get excited about.
907791	910332	Make poor tracks if you don't want to make a new game.
910472	911152	I don't care.
911212	914094	I will buy them for whatever price you want to charge.
914494	915854	I just need some more Excite Trucks.
915894	918735	I don't want to have to buy Motorstorm 2.
918775	919776	1 wasn't very impressive.
919796	921216	That and custom soundtrack.
921496	923077	I mean, Excite Truck was kind of neat.
924597	934146	I can understand Excite Truck, that's fine, because that game really does need custom soundtracks, but Endless Ocean, what the fuck?
934487	936489	You don't need custom soundtracks in that game.
936849	939952	You can't swim through the ocean and rob zombies.
939972	940773	It's just not right.
940793	941494	It's too slow.
941974	943015	Excite Truck is fucking awesome.
944897	948941	You could play through Excite Truck for the multi, not only the long.
961308	963209	I know it's funny, but you know what?
963309	971394	Every time I hear a Justin Timberlake song now, I think of Excite Truck, and, you know, I used to play it to, like, you know, really cool shit.
971474	973556	Oh, yeah, that thing is hilarious, that commercial.
973616	974936	I just, I don't know.
991025	996827	What if they were to do, like, a different type of vehicle for an Excite something game?
997587	998768	As long as they just say, I don't care.
999188	1000248	Excite Boat.
1000348	1001249	Excite ATV.
1001269	1003530	That would be Moon Frasier.
1003550	1003930	Here you go.
1004030	1005670	Excite ATV on the Moon.
1006891	1008792	Well, they didn't have a space level.
1009032	1010092	You remember Nebula?
1010152	1010852	I know, it's true.
1012593	1013153	Alright, okay.
1013454	1019576	Now we've turned in our most current news thing about Mario Kart Wii into Excite Truck Remedy thing somehow, so
1024013	1031198	I have some Wii-related stuff, only it's more for a virtual console, and specifically for our friends in the UK.
1031918	1044127	The games that are coming out this week from HAL region is Super Turrican, that was the Super Nintendo game, and Psychosis, that was on the TurboGrafx-16.
1045348	1047209	Factor 5 made Super Turrican.
1047289	1048230	It's 800 points.
1048750	1051372	It uses the classic and GameCube controller in Psychosis.
1052173	1060195	It's set under B-Point and it also uses the classic and cube heads and also uses the V-Mode.
1060355	1066097	And for anyone who hasn't heard of Psychosis, because I know that TurboGrafx tends to be on the obscure end, it's a side-scrolling shooter.
1067958	1074199	You can also position satellites around your ship and kill stuff with them.
1076500	1078201	Killing with satellites is awesome.
1078301	1079261	Hooray, killing!
1081616	1087919	So if you don't want to mod your Wii, there are other options now for you to be able to play in-court games.
1088159	1096664	Thanks to the freeloader, of course you may remember that from the GameCube as being able to play wonderful in-court games then.
1097865	1101006	Kojilskis is now offering a freeloader for the Wii.
1101366	1103127	It's going to do a bunch of other things, though.
1103387	1105348	It's going to be for $19.99 in the U.S., U.K.
1105369	1107109	for $9.99 pounds, I believe.
1110883	1114587	and it's going to allow a couple different things to happen.
1114767	1119971	One, it will stop any updates that are on the game disc so you don't end up with duplicate channels.
1120412	1122353	You know, you import stuff, that's kind of what happens.
1122674	1124215	Not a big deal, but annoying.
1124956	1136326	And it will also be kind of invisible to your console so that, you know, they hope that there will be no updates to destroy it like they did with the GameCube one.
1138604	1144430	It is available now, and hopefully it won't be broken soon.
1147773	1161447	So, you know, we had a little bit of controversy last week, and I'm sure it's going to continue on into our Mailbag and Skype segments this week, but would you say there is a legitimate, non-shady purpose for this?
1165405	1169309	Like on my GameCube, I had Phil Caliber 2, and I also had one of the Battletoe Fighters.
1187062	1190343	you know, back before they decided to release them, all of them over here.
1190443	1198027	You know, if this was more like, you know, the DS or something like that, where it was region-free, I think you'd see a lot more people buying games for other reasons, you know.
1198527	1207791	Here's my crowd, or here's my question to the crowd, about, you know, because we had kind of two different, very opposite sides talking about whole modding and all that stuff last week.
1207811	1216134	My question is, to the people that are not, that do not support mod chips and piracy and all that stuff, is the freeloader ethical?
1216772	1217492	That's my question.
1217532	1218313	I'm kind of curious.
1218353	1220574	Like, are you okay with the freeloader?
1221034	1222935	Seeing that there is a very legitimate purpose to it.
1222955	1225357	I would think so because you can't pirate games with it.
1226017	1226577	Ah, okay.
1226958	1233381	You know, as far as we're aware, I mean, you can't pirate games with it, but... Is it one of those it's just a matter of time things?
1233961	1234422	Who knows?
1234542	1241386	I mean, with the freeloader, I mean, I don't think... He can change the region on it, so... Who knows?
1241566	1245688	I mean, because it's obviously tricking the console into thinking something that, you know...
1246614	1257938	My thing would be, like I said, you know, because now we're getting these staggered release dates, you know, like Mario Kart in the UK is coming out, you know, a couple weeks before, you know, the US release.
1258018	1262580	I mean, if you really wanted to, you could actually get that name early in English and be able to play it.
1262640	1263520	Comments from chat.
1263540	1266522	Ross DLUT says, well, if you can't pirate games, then by all means.
1266862	1269043	Son of Dad says, yes, I just want to play the games.
1269803	1272824	DJ Janai says, yes, I want to play all games no matter what.
1273143	1288297	There's another thing, too, that actually was mentioned on the blurb on the freeloader sales area, was that for people who have non-region systems, that this is a way to play local games.
1288337	1292121	Like, I've, you know, I actually have key friends who, you know,
1293138	1293699	All right.
1312182	1326513	Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing some feedback with some of our listeners, because I know we have a lot of listeners that are into import gaming, because we're one of the fewer gaming podcasts that actually cover kind of the import scene outside of just America, so I'm kind of curious what one of our listeners, some of our listeners should use this.
1326533	1328654	Are you getting one, Loki, or are you not bothering to get one?
1328714	1333678	I'm not bothering, but I have a bodship, so... DarkSakura, you are thinking of getting one, right?
1333878	1335039	I am going to get one next payday.
1335399	1336160	Let me know what you think.
1336240	1340103	Yeah, because, I mean, there's... I don't have any import games, because that's not except for my game people.
1340403	1341444	Thank you for borrowing this match, brother.
1347312	1349574	I don't get into import games enough to get one.
1349594	1353017	The only import game I've ever really gone crazy for was BVNia 2DX.
1353858	1360684	I said you forget crazy all the time on PS2, but you know, even a little quick thing is, you know I had to get Bust Move back in the day.
1361104	1362545	Yeah, I actually had a Japanese PlayStation 2.
1362625	1363046	I still do.
1363066	1363866	I wonder if it worked.
1364006	1365087	I have a Japanese Dreamcast.
1365528	1371693	For some reason I decided that Wangan Midnight for the PS3, that was a mistake, and I thought, I won't import any more PS3 games.
1371713	1372454	Was it not good?
1373154	1374035	It was shit.
1374555	1375116	Does it play?
1375560	1376581	Yeah, I played this fine.
1376601	1378984	We've played Region 3 here, Region 3, so.
1381126	1382147	Alright, anyhow.
1383268	1386992	Let's move on, because speaking of the mailbag, I know we want to get there, and it's coming right up.
1387012	1391877	But real quick, I want to give you one more Wii story, and that's about Wii Fit.
1392698	1394820	Wii Fit has been given a price in Europe.
1394860	1397963	If you're going to buy the game in the UK, it's going to be $50.
1400265	1402226	I'm thinking, I'm thinking, um...
1428137	1428858	Thank you for watching!
1446442	1447142	I'd buy that for $89.99.
1448343	1449323	All right, well, anyhow.
1450443	1455205	But, you know, in Europe, unfortunately, you are paying more for games usually.
1455265	1460226	So while we might get it for $89.99, might get it for $89.99, we possibly will get it for $89.99.
1460826	1465087	You guys will have to pay $89.99, which is considerably more.
1467568	1468308	Sorry to break it to you.
1469349	1470029	All right, anyhow.
1471238	1472659	Let's open up the old mailbag.
1472719	1477121	We love to hear from our listeners, and every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelongradio.com.
1477381	1483203	DarkSakura likes to dive in the mailbag headfirst and pull out some of her favorite emails, and she's going to read them right now.
1483243	1484424	I have my snorkel ready.
1486885	1487605	And your rubber glove?
1489586	1491687	Yeah, I'm wearing a snorkel.
1491947	1493388	Just in case it's by Ambrex.
1495408	1496329	Uh, can I draw?
1498152	1500934	I think I have, well, no, no, no, no, no, I have something far better.
1501094	1504336	I'm talking about bad 80s bands, not the, uh... I like Anthrax!
1505656	1506237	Alright, sorry.
1506377	1510999	Excuse me, Anthrax and Public Enemy is like the best combination ever, hi!
1512921	1520665	Speaking of great bands of the past, do you know what band really needs to, I've decided after all the commercials on TV, do you know what band really needs to come to Rock Band?
1527617	1535046	You need to see the Lost Odyssey commercial with the White Rabbit music, it's pretty awesome
1545911	1549232	This is why we don't have text chat in Mario Kart.
1576724	1582569	I was wondering what other good games are on there that I should get.
1582589	1584230	Thanks guys, you get me through the week.
1584250	1585631	Dude, you did not get Super Metroid!
1585651	1585852	Get it!
1609721	1611462	No, it was Alien Crush, sorry.
1611482	1613223	Guardian, or Gunstar Heroes.
1613264	1614584	Gunstar Heroes, Alien Crush.
1614985	1616526	Yeah, your list needs more Sega.
1617547	1619968	I think that there was not enough Sega in the list.
1620489	1621730	Was there more like 3 hours?
1622230	1623631	Uh, yeah, I think they all are.
1623651	1625892	Mario Kart, 64.
1627394	1628354	Mario 64.
1629355	1631737	Maybe Mario Kart, like, yeah, there's another Mario Kart.
1631837	1633938	Oh, I bet there's something more Mario Kart we've got here.
1634979	1635279	I bet.
1636060	1637541	Do you want Super Metroid now?
1641818	1644820	DarkSakura, chat room wanted to see if you would get this reference.
1647022	1649384	The bass line is opening the...
1676648	1681772	No, I don't really like that song.
1681812	1683054	But it does have a sweet bass word.
1683514	1685876	The bass word is what made me think of that word, actually.
1686136	1686516	Oh, okay.
1689439	1696505	I did just see this really awful band, and we went outside, and their bass line, it was a band called 8-Bit.
1697365	1698106	They weren't very good.
1699407	1700688	They were rapping, wearing hazmat suits.
1703553	1707917	But we were coming back from drinking at the Pyramid across the street.
1707937	1710119	This is at the Gilman in Berkeley.
1710679	1714502	And we came back and stood outside and their bass line was the Legend of Zelda theme.
1714903	1716044	Their bass line was.
1717705	1719907	Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
1719927	1720227	Yeah.
1720347	1720627	Nice.
1720788	1723470	They were awful, though.
1723750	1725952	I thought it was awful.
1725992	1728994	But Babyland played that show, so Babyland, Ricky, did the whole thing.
1729155	1729455	All right.
1729955	1730396	Moving on.
1733484	1738166	Okay, it seems like there's some head tracking popping up lately in console world.
1739086	1746969	Everyone keeps looking at Sony One at GEC and I'm surprised nobody knows what the track are that's been going around for years.
1747409	1748830	I have one and it works great.
1750550	1752471	It is only for the PC though.
1752511	1755432	It has six degrees of movement and you can use it as
1756405	1760226	A mouse control that you can use with any game that doesn't have direct support for the track IR.
1760966	1763647	It's really huge for racing and flight games.
1763847	1769549	There is one FPS game that it does support, and that's from Pendragon.
1770309	1773310	I guess this game should be used for Marvel Madness.
1774730	1776890	Heck yeah, that's a game we need to do.
1777131	1778311	Or even better, to watch
1791287	1809044	Loki, DarkSakura, and Skye, with regards to the call in last episode about system hacking, I have to comment, true, if there was some of the content that it hacked from or allows you to play games without paying for them, even though this can be seen as wrong, I think that it's kind of funny that they can do this in the first place.
1809545	1815369	But some of the firmware is better than the proper firmware.
1815409	1824155	For example, a Skype program is only for thin TFCs if they can get to work on 6 TFCs more power to them, as it is more fair if everything works on those systems.
1824816	1829519	Also, if they can get 3 games that people make to work as cool as handmade games are good.
1830171	1836375	I also believe that if you do stop talking about hacks, then you would miss out on a huge part of the gaming world.
1836395	1839997	And I'm just saying this only as a reply to the call, I know you won't.
1841038	1847062	Secondly, you often talk about how the PlayStation 3 is a giant letdown, but I have to say this
1848240	1858623	Fearplay, that there are a lot more games in the Xbox 360, but I am the only person in my group of friends to have a PS3, and I will think every single one of the others' Xboxes have three rings at one point or the other.
1860184	1863165	Finally, keep up the good show and help Sky feel better, like Anna.
1865540	1865980	Well, thank you.
1866041	1866841	I am feeling better.
1867001	1878153	And, you know, you do bring up an issue about the whole, you know, the firmwares definitely do serve a legitimate purpose.
1878173	1884279	And I think that's how kind of a lot of people get away with this and get them to the radar because there is a legitimate purpose for a lot of this.
1884579	1887522	But I think it just becomes a moral issue about how you choose to use it.
1887932	1909936	I mean, if you choose to use it to get Skype on your PSP, which is free anyway, that whole thing, you know, I don't think that's as big of a moral problem, so to speak, as, you know, getting this on there so you can hacksore all the NES games from your past, or, you know, better yet, download all the PlayStation 1 games you always wanted to play and all that, or PSP games.
1909976	1913237	So, you know, that's just a moral question.
1913257	1915257	I'm not saying one's right or wrong, because there's a lot, you know,
1916497	1919080	A lot of people steal music like there's no tomorrow.
1919240	1928989	Well, there's a lot of legitimate things that they've started in homebrew that I think Sony has saw and they're like, hey, let's throw that into an official release.
1929369	1931852	Like, for example, internet streaming radio.
1931972	1936256	That's been available on the homebrew scene for a long time now.
1936676	1940680	And then they, what, last up, they finally implemented some of that stuff.
1942921	1943221	I don't know.
1943241	1944561	There's a lot of stuff that comes out there.
1944581	1948162	They have YouTube stuff that you can view now straight on your PSP.
1949623	1956965	They had stuff that hooked up to your GPS a while back, even before they had the GPS for the PSP.
1957205	1957825	There's a lot of stuff.
1957885	1959666	And now they're coming out with purple.
1959686	1961946	They're like tilt-centered stuff at Chromebook.
1962887	1964587	Basically, you have the force.
1964707	1967448	It's your choice if you wish to choose to turn to the dark side.
1967788	1968048	Yeah.
1968068	1969448	All right.
1970409	1971049	Next email?
1971409	1971689	Sure.
1972694	1976236	Hey OLR Crew, I was just emailing to give my side of the modding talk.
1976736	1986962	I was apparently crucified simply for asking about the illegitimate question by Rosso UT Hold up, is this the email, this is the one that Rosso UT had called in to respond to last week, same person, I'm assuming?
1988103	1989064	I think so, yeah.
1990765	1992125	I think so, yeah, yeah.
1992145	1994126	Okay, just curious, just wanted to get that out there.
1996108	2001811	Um, because he doesn't agree with modding, modchips are part of gaming culture and community just because they can
2002332	2003033	What did I do?
2003053	2003533	Okay, whatever.
2025020	2026201	I think he must have typed this immediately.
2026241	2028262	He probably typed this right as he was listening to the call.
2028602	2030924	So, give it a little flex.
2031004	2035827	Not all of the people who did mod are people who sit behind our computers wearing ski masks trying to steal games from the internet.
2036387	2041570	People back up their DVDs and music CDs, so I've seen their reason why it's such a gray area when it comes to games.
2042552	2049596	Some people use modchips to preserve their investments, others are interested in the technical aspect of it, and yet they are a group who simply wish to steal games.
2050116	2056280	I like hearing Loki's talk about him trying to fix his 360 and all the modifications he does to it, along with his V-Mod.
2056840	2060282	It's just part of gaming culture, and I'm glad OLR doesn't filter topics like this.
2060762	2064244	I just wish that someone would jump down the throat for people who are interested in modding.
2064584	2069287	Next time my $50 game gets destroyed out of my hands, I'll send you anti-modder for the bill.
2070103	2072204	and Loki, you helped me a lot with your tips.
2072304	2076326	I got my chip successfully installed so no more coasters for me.
2076426	2076866	Epic win.
2076946	2078327	I hope you feel better this week, Rob.
2078367	2083509	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.
2084630	2086311	You need to have Olive Garden night pretty soon.
2087071	2088912	Or some real Italian food for once.
2090253	2090793	I don't know, though.
2091073	2094014	I can actually go to the Olive Garden.
2094134	2095355	I just ate there a couple days ago.
2100370	2101031	Here's the deal.
2101631	2107394	I totally agree with what he's saying about that it is a part of gaming culture and that's what we're all about.
2107414	2108655	That's why we need to cover it on the show.
2109435	2113137	I think he made some good points.
2113197	2114337	I think the cog made some good points.
2116178	2116539	and so on.
2133835	2134055	and so on.
2157737	2184308	Here, I don't know, kind of taking it a step further, as long as this stuff continues, it's going to be interesting because I think the game industry has the potential to turn into almost kind of what the music industry is doing, where I think especially through things, that's why I said last week, I think that XNA thing is such huge news, because I think in the future you're going to start seeing a lot more download your games onto the, you know, and indie developers making things in-house that you download, you know, just kind of like music is turning into, where, you know, in
2184873	2187035	More stuff is getting out there because of iTunes and stuff.
2187436	2190599	But, I mean, I think we're about five, maybe even ten years away from that.
2190659	2193702	But, anyhow, that's my ramble.
2195083	2197666	Yeah, my little ramble.
2197886	2198947	There's no easy solution.
2198967	2201990	There's nothing any of us are going to say that's going to please both sides of it.
2202250	2205734	I think, though, we're doing a disservice by ignoring it.
2206172	2208293	So, ignoring it's not going to make it go away.
2208693	2213015	Well, personally, I have no problem with that, that someone wants to do.
2213095	2216236	I mean, it's not my place to tell anybody what they can or can't do.
2216256	2219938	It's just up to them if they want to deal with the consequences of being caught.
2220098	2221299	Right, and here's one thing.
2221379	2221919	Realize
2222319	2228560	At any time, one of these companies may come up with a magic patch that's going to nerf your Wii if you mod it.
2229000	2230440	And there's going to be no choice.
2230460	2232981	You're going to have to install the thing to play the latest game or something.
2233021	2235601	And it's not just going to render the game in Apple.
2235621	2237442	It's going to completely nerf your freaking Wii.
2237742	2239402	Your freaking iPhone.
2239422	2239782	Exactly.
2240102	2241802	Your freaking iPhone and all that stuff.
2241822	2243083	So that's the chance you take.
2243403	2244903	Someday your thing is going to get bricked.
2245803	2248364	And, you know, that's the chance you took.
2248904	2249144	So.
2250124	2250244	Yep.
2251212	2251592	Mary Allen.
2252333	2252714	That's it.
2253855	2255056	For me.
2255096	2255717	Next email.
2256357	2257859	Hi, Skye, Loki, and DarkSakura.
2257879	2262423	I'm emailing on behalf of the semi-obliterated PS2 sitting in a bag in my room.
2262924	2270632	The other day I arrived at school suspecting it would be like any other day when one of my friends informed me in his wisdom that the PS2 stopped working the previous afternoon.
2270712	2273595	And actually, he took a hammer to the case and smashed it open.
2274329	2285113	The irony here is that before the fan had only chipped a few teeth, and now the cage is bent forward, the metal things on the inside are bent and the laser may be broken, but I'm not sure, and one of the ribbons has been damaged.
2285634	2293797	I've taken the console from him, and I was just wondering whether any of you know a good site that I could get spare parts from, and particularly if Loki knew a fairer way to test the laser.
2294197	2295638	With love, Heart's Lonely Nagel.
2296978	2299059	I mean, you can order replacement parts from Tony.
2299659	2301180	Well, you could for the older stuff, huh?
2302000	2304141	I don't know if you can still order stuff from him.
2304568	2312872	but I was going to say, I don't know, the only way to test the laser I would think is to put a game in it and actually test it.
2313632	2318354	For spare parts though, you might be able to check out llama.com.
2318454	2321135	I've gotten some Xbox 360 mod stuff from there.
2322275	2324797	I don't know if they carry Playstation 2 stuff anymore, I think they do.
2326217	2333060	Do they have like official, I'm sorry, did they have like official Sony repair centers like they have for some other types of products?
2333356	2336898	Like, maybe there's a place you can take your PS2 and get just the laser thingy tweaked?
2337638	2338338	Um, maybe.
2339079	2341460	Uh, I don't know.
2341480	2342820	How old, I'm sorry, I might have missed it.
2342860	2344361	How old did you say the PlayStation 2 was?
2344381	2345701	Did you say it was like an old school one?
2346442	2347402	Uh, maybe they did not say.
2347962	2359267	You know, if it's one of the old school, you know, huge, uh, you know, PlayStation 2s, the old model, it might just be time, because obviously by the time you fix some of this stuff, you're practically paying what you pay for a PS2 mini.
2359527	2362049	People put broken ones on eBay, though, too, don't they?
2362429	2362689	Yeah.
2363735	2372581	Yeah, you can, I mean, they're kind of getting cheap now, and you can probably find a cheap PS2 for, you know, nothing.
2372842	2376664	I mean... Let's test the theory.
2377005	2382929	If the system isn't too bashed up, you can get it fixed at www.oldschoolgamer.ca, but that indicates it's Canadian.
2383029	2384710	I don't know if that would work.
2385391	2388753	Here's an example.
2389394	2392096	Your cables and stuff, your ribbon cables, those are about $10,
2393651	2395973	Um, and then the lens is about $40.
2396433	2400957	So right there at $50 is half the price of your PS2, mine is $5.
2401077	2407962	Okay, I'm looking on, um, GameStop's website, and I need, I don't know, we can go and buy from GameStop.
2408763	2417650	Um, but the, um, the, the, uh, old style PS2 refurb is $79.99, so the new style is $99.99.
2418691	2423234	So, and you'll, and if you find them at just the used ones, they'll be cheaper than that.
2423530	2428191	and some of that is pointing out that Target was actually having a sale on PS2s last week for 99 new.
2428712	2434173	So, there you go.
2434433	2436754	Keep an eye on those websites.
2436814	2438995	I'm sure that's not the answer you wanted to hear that we're telling you.
2439035	2440315	Basically, go buy a new PS2.
2441456	2446517	But keep an eye on those websites like CheapAssGamer and some of those other video game deals websites too.
2446537	2448178	Once in a while something might pop up there.
2448198	2449318	So, always keep an eye on it.
2449618	2452139	But if you do want to get your old system fixed,
2452868	2456829	Um, there are ways that you might have to have a professional step in, or you're gonna void your warranty.
2457009	2459330	It just might as well at this point just to buy a new one.
2459450	2464171	I mean, there's a point you gotta say, well, it's expensive to fix it, just buy a new one.
2464671	2466992	But, uh, Ross, CLUT, and Chaperones have a good point.
2467112	2470773	Uh, what if he's a Final Fantasy XI player, then EPS2 won't support the HDD.
2471533	2472394	Then buy an older one.
2473054	2474054	And quit Final Fantasy XI.
2474074	2475435	I'm just kidding.
2475495	2476855	I'm just kidding.
2477495	2478656	Oh yeah, you gotta go with PC version.
2478776	2479596	Alright, anyhow, sorry.
2479656	2480076	More email?
2480954	2485436	Hey, I was a controller player on this game.
2485496	2487056	I don't know how you even play that game on controller.
2487096	2487636	Just call me Joy.
2487796	2492898	I know, I just, and it was designed for controllers, the hilarious thing, but I cannot play that game on anything but a keyboard.
2492918	2494339	The macros are so easy with triggers.
2494479	2495219	They're really easy.
2495359	2495739	But anyway.
2495759	2496439	Alright, hang on.
2496799	2499740	Um, hey everyone, before I begin, there's a couple things I must say.
2499760	2501121	First of all, hail Jamie Worship.
2501721	2501901	Yes.
2501941	2502401	Who is this?
2503442	2503802	Baja.
2504042	2504622	Oh, okay.
2505122	2506563	I've got me some new shoes.
2507223	2507423	Anyway.
2508134	2514360	Secondly, I want to say that I look forward to each episode of Sunday Night and the podcasts that get me through my daily commute to and from work.
2515161	2517383	Now that the formalities are out of the way, just let me say this.
2518465	2526713	As I listen to Roscoe UT's Thoughts on Mining, I can tell that you, Rob, weren't too happy about that.
2526793	2528215	I can tell in your voice that you...
2529853	2531174	weren't that happy about that.
2531534	2535137	Let me just say that my PS2 has been modded for three plus years.
2535637	2538579	During that time, I have over a thousand dollars worth of bootleg games.
2539160	2539380	Why?
2539440	2542542	Simply put, I do not have the money to shell out each week to buy these titles.
2543142	2544203	But all isn't lost.
2544443	2549847	On the positive side, playing copied games allowed me the chance to play and try out some of the games and see if I like it.
2549927	2554810	Honestly, no one here wants to drop 40 bucks on a PS2 game and find out later that the game sucks and it's a waste.
2555311	2558033	Having a modded console allows me to check out imported games as well.
2559426	2566170	When I write this, I tend to think of myself as a hypocrite because my real substance is to fix some computers with bootleg software.
2566630	2578176	I tell customers not to use bootleg enterprise corporate software as well as software that belongs to a friend of theirs, but alas, some will not listen, and unlike also UT, I do not take this to heart.
2578916	2581578	Overall, I do not see a problem with modding consoles.
2581618	2587721	Mods allow us to break things with consoles, not just copies slash burned games.
2588197	2592361	Now, if I download a game that's really good and I would go out and buy it, case in point, Kingdom Hearts 2.
2592802	2601651	As a friend who is in the gaming industry that gives me grief about copy games, to say that, I say to her, are you going to buy me this game?
2601731	2602211	No, you're not.
2602272	2604794	Plus, I want to see if the game is actually worth buying.
2605134	2606196	And if it is, I'll buy it.
2606456	2607677	In the meantime, leave me be.
2609819	2610320	Overall,
2610925	2612126	Roughly Pete, shut up.
2612967	2614088	Leave us modders alone.
2614128	2616530	We are not damaging the gaming industry at all.
2616830	2622916	From my knowledge, there's no proof of that as either.
2623376	2632304	There's usually what it comes down to, and this is the same argument with MP3 downloading and stuff like that, is everyone... That's the recycle thing.
2632324	2633205	It's just the recycle.
2633245	2634166	Well, it's not that.
2634326	2635167	It's just people...
2636892	2642394	The industry doesn't actually lose money from these people because these people are never going to buy the product in the first place.
2642854	2645955	So you didn't miss out on a sale because they were never going to buy it.
2645995	2649096	Same with people downloading import games or something like that.
2649116	2650636	They weren't going to buy it in the first place.
2650696	2656238	So the modern thinking is it's not going to hurt anybody.
2656298	2661259	I mean, obviously, still, they could import it and spend the money and do that kind of stuff.
2661279	2662940	But I don't know.
2663120	2665801	It's immoral, maybe.
2667102	2668864	is it really hurting the industry?
2669885	2685800	Maybe, not quite, I don't know, I mean stuff like say for example a lot of people are burning copies of Halo 3 or something like that, yeah that's going to hurt the sales of that game, especially if they were intending on buying it in the first place, I don't know.
2687362	2688563	That's why a lot of companies
2700525	2708332	And here's another thing, maybe, you know, people will respect your games more, like, you know, stop putting out shovelware.
2708853	2709913	Looking at you, Destineer.
2711055	2720163	Uh, and just to address the part of the letter that talked about me, uh, getting kind of, um, I don't know what he said about the call, but I was... He didn't seem happy about it.
2720183	2721043	I didn't seem happy about it.
2721304	2725167	Here's the thing, well, A, I was sick last week, so cut me some slack, and so that kind of, um,
2725700	2727461	Lens My Sense of Professionalism
2748248	2749149	I kind of knew.
2749969	2753312	And that's interesting in a way, it's part of the charm of the show.
2753632	2761978	We open up the sky's line, anybody can call about anything, you don't know what it's going to be, and we're going to deal with it and talk about it on air.
2762078	2763719	It's kind of part of what makes the show unique.
2763979	2769783	But when the call came in, I kind of knew that it was opening a can of worms, and that's why I wasn't happy.
2769803	2773426	Not that I wasn't happy with the opinion or whatever, I wasn't happy because I was just kind of like...
2774166	2778850	Oh boy, I know there's going to be emails on this next week, and probably some more calls later on tonight.
2778890	2784936	I don't know if this was an epic battle I was awaiting.
2786337	2788038	The rest of this email.
2788079	2797767	Thanks for reading my letter on air, and Rob, I apologize for using your show to call out a fellow OLR listener, but I do not reject and allow a travesty of a comment of rawful UT's to go by unnoticed.
2798291	2800332	Rock on and have a most triumphant week.
2800532	2801913	It's DJ Ranma S. P.S.
2802354	2807897	If roughly you two want to comment back, by all means, my email, Addie, is listed, and I guess you can P.S.
2808077	2808237	me.
2808257	2809498	Yeah, they're both in chat right now.
2809518	2810358	Hug it out, boys.
2810398	2811039	Hug it out.
2811399	2814461	And he wants me to plug his podcast, so I am.
2814641	2815962	Okay, fair enough.
2815982	2820625	Anime Jam Session at DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam.
2822166	2825128	Go listen to it, but not right now, because we're live.
2825388	2825588	All right.
2827008	2828068	Any other emails, or was that it?
2828149	2828589	There's more.
2828789	2831470	Oh, dang, we've got talent emails tonight.
2831650	2831990	I know.
2832030	2833451	All right, let's get through them.
2833491	2835612	Hey, OLR crew, I have a question for DarkSakura.
2835792	2836432	Hey, cool.
2837072	2842055	You said months ago that you put Pump Up the Volume on hold after your laptop got fried.
2842075	2843595	No, it was after my PC got fried.
2844236	2845156	How is that coming along?
2845216	2847697	It would be great to listen to Pump Up the Volume again someday.
2847757	2852179	It's nice break from what the 24-7 stream provides on GS68.
2853500	2855601	Actually, there's progress in this today.
2857811	2867677	I had a computer that I could use, but the problem is that I want something with a bit more on the graphic capabilities side, just for the sake of all the other projects I do.
2868577	2873040	And I have been using my laptop, but my laptop likes to run really friggin' slow.
2873800	2875882	I think I'm actually going to replace all the memory in it.
2878043	2884908	But we have gutted out one of the VAIOs sitting in our garage.
2885468	2901119	And although one of them is promised, that sort of leaves the other one up in the air because it might be promised as well, we are looking into putting a VAMP graphics card in it, my old hard drive, basically building a frankie-cooter for me.
2901139	2905943	That wasn't, you know, what my old computer was, sort of a Frankenstein of parts, but...
2906764	2910848	Pump Up the Volume, it all goes to plan.
2910969	2915914	I'm looking for a return of Pump Up the Volume soon.
2916134	2922641	However, I'm also going back to college, which I don't know if I've mentioned to my co-hosts here.
2923802	2929088	But I am planning on going back to school and I'm finishing a degree this year and finishing one next year too.
2936911	2945875	I am a year away from an AA.
2946716	2951978	I'm another year away from another AA.
2952058	2952979	And then I can gloat.
2953219	2959042	By the way, for those that may not know, because we do have the podcast, but when she speaks to Pump Up the Volume, she's talking about one of her weeknight shows.
2959422	2961663	Yeah, it was last night, and it didn't stop.
2962438	2965759	And we do have a couple of weeknight shows, just a handful right now.
2965999	2972460	And I've got to be honest, if I didn't have a full-time job, just trying to manage all that stuff is difficult.
2973061	2974901	So I don't know.
2975021	2985924	We may soon try to hire for the pay is great, nothing, but some type of director of weeknight programming that could get some of these great podcasts that deserve to be heard on the live stream.
2986324	2988204	Just to try to sort that all out.
2988444	2990365	But then we have our website needs to get updated too much time.
2990385	2990725	No time?
2991716	2992577	Hey, good news.
2992657	2994358	Cheeseburger is taking our advice.
2994818	2997540	What's that?
2998161	2999022	Oh, buying Super Mentor?
2999062	2999142	Yep.
2999882	3000683	Swell.
3001303	3002124	Alright, one more email.
3004366	3005266	Last email.
3005286	3008269	Dun dun dun.
3008289	3014253	This is worth it, because this is our buddy, Warrior Bob.
3015734	3016034	Yay.
3018956	3019876	Hi, emailer.
3020276	3023857	It's so good to hear you mentioning the old Apogee and Epic software games last week.
3024177	3027458	Brings back good memories from times when computer games looked like computer games.
3028058	3031199	This is a topic that's been coming up recently in looks to my friends and me.
3031860	3041702	Back when these games were the forefront of computer entertainment, back when Windows had version numbers, PR made adventure games and Duke Nukem games were named after the development time.
3042662	3045603	I see what you did there.
3046223	3048364	There was a certain look and feel to computer games.
3048849	3057377	Visual animations and effects were the product of teams of technical artists so much as they were the result of clever programming tricks done by empty people.
3057758	3065685	Things like single pixel particle effects, characters made of multiple sprites, color cycling distortions, that sort of thing.
3066266	3068989	I feel that it's kind of gone now and I realize I missed it.
3069660	3072082	Don't get me wrong, I love the new ideas too.
3072283	3079589	I wanted to see games like Shadows of Clocks and Rock Band ever since I was a little kid with a bunch of game design scribbles in my notebook.
3080270	3088938	But at the same time, the only recent game I can think of that had the same computerized feel I grew up on was Cave Story, a freeware indie title.
3090239	3094803	Entrenched as you all are in the video game scene, have you come across any games that still embody this aesthetic?
3095652	3099455	I find I play games more for the experience than the challenge these days.
3100156	3106201	And so I'd love to find something like this and see what people with new ideas have done with old styles.
3106521	3107522	Thanks again, as always.
3107562	3108743	Keep up the excellent show.
3108763	3109323	Warrior Bob.
3109723	3109904	P.S.
3109924	3110364	Hi, Dan.
3110764	3111985	I guess he meant that for my hoodie.
3112446	3114247	He was supposed to be on the show this week, too.
3114968	3116269	That's why I think he put that.
3117129	3120172	I know, and the head didn't come, so whatever.
3120933	3125076	Here's my crazy thought, is that they don't make these games anymore because they just didn't sell?
3127392	3135475	I have to say this, is that, and for lack of a, you know, I'm not trying to be mean to anybody, but honestly, the market today is a lot more fickle.
3136295	3138756	They want it to look pretty, you know.
3139877	3143618	They don't care as much about the game, you know, the way the game plays.
3143738	3146119	They don't care as much about the experience of the game.
3146439	3150000	They want it to be pretty, and automatically, if it's not pretty, it's shit.
3150700	3152981	So, that's what's happened.
3153441	3155482	They're playing to a superficial market.
3156335	3157136	I think you're kind of right.
3157716	3158997	I think that is kind of what it boils down to.
3159017	3162200	That's when computer games kind of lost their distinctive look, so to speak.
3162400	3167204	But then I look at a game like Sam & Max and to me that game is like a, it's almost a throwback in a way.
3167264	3172108	It is kind of like those old LucasArts games, but in a newer cartoony, visual-ish style.
3172468	3177552	So, I mean, they're out there, but yeah, it's not like it used to be then.
3177572	3185358	I remember walking into Egghead Software and you'd have like, you know, Legend of Kyrandia and King's Quest and all this stuff for sale and
3185745	3189068	You know, those were the days, but, you know, then again, a fake headstopper went out of business.
3189288	3196114	So that tells me that, or at least they're online now or whatever, so that tells me that, you know, they just must not have been selling as well as consoles really took off.
3196535	3197456	I love Kyra India.
3197796	3198316	Me too!
3199197	3203241	My sister still plays, in fact, she is playing King's Quest 7 right now.
3203341	3204502	I'll tell you what was funny.
3205103	3205403	Hmm.
3205723	3208366	Is, uh, I can't very close to downloading money.
3214389	3216850	There's people who still do them.
3216870	3222834	There's BBSs set up so people can play Legend of the Red Dragon still online, which is like hard.
3222894	3223394	And The Pit.
3223734	3226576	Dude, we need an OLR BBS so we can play The Pit.
3226736	3230378	You know what my first, I would have to say, real MMO was?
3230698	3231198	Gemstone 3.
3232499	3232839	Awesome.
3233420	3234480	It was all text.
3235481	3237262	Dude, how can we set up an OLR BBS?
3237362	3239503	I know it's going to be possible if we tell them that or something.
3240363	3241204	How can we make that happen?
3242697	3243177	That shouldn't be.
3243197	3244958	Somebody email me if you know how to make that happen.
3245478	3247760	I wouldn't think that would be too bad.
3247900	3249000	I know, it's all on our BBS.
3249020	3250741	We're going to play The Pit with our listeners.
3250781	3254363	That would be bomb.
3254443	3257745	Warrior Bob is actually in chat right now and says, see, yeah, that's just it.
3257785	3259826	Famimax looks like a new 3D game.
3259886	3262267	No big pixels or clever animation anywhere.
3262887	3267030	Oh, yeah, I think just the market big pixels didn't sell, I guess.
3267050	3271112	Well, I mean, if you want
3273786	3279708	I'm playing Ragnarok online, and honestly, I've read up on Ragnarok 2.
3280588	3286889	And while, yeah, it's cool facial animation, I like my cutesy sprites.
3287389	3288170	I think it's cool.
3288430	3295632	I like that I can play it on a system that I'll have to have a whole bunch of crap for, because it still plays pretty damn fun.
3296712	3297732	And I like Lume.
3299252	3299853	I love Lume.
3299893	3301133	Lume is such a good game.
3301193	3301393	Lume.
3302594	3307896	And I miss my old, um, pixel-y, um, games like Doom and Hexen.
3308176	3308837	I love Hexen.
3309657	3310497	I've covered Hexen.
3310757	3311298	Good times.
3311678	3312618	But that's it for now.
3313198	3313578	Alright.
3314639	3315539	Get a piece of the war.
3315639	3317520	Dang it, there was a lot of mailbags this week.
3317760	3318380	I know.
3318620	3322042	Mailbag to OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send your emails.
3322782	3323302	Get them!
3323963	3325623	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.
3325643	3326904	The segment's running low tonight.
3326964	3327444	I know.
3329725	3331626	Oh yeah, that would be News Witness.
3332006	3332166	No.
3339595	3348499	So this whole Activision Blizzard merger thing happened a little bit ago, you know, when they merged with NVIDIA.
3349280	3353862	And because of that, some investors think that they're getting the bum end of the deal.
3354583	3358905	And in fact, actually, it's an Activision investor who sued over the entire merger.
3360287	3368130	Their complaint was that NVIDIA actually comes out on top of the merger with a 50% majority ownership of Activision.
3370931	3378014	And because of this, didn't think of the stockholders, or didn't think of the stockholders when they accepted the deal.
3378214	3382996	So, that is their complaint, and now they're pissed off about it.
3383676	3384877	I don't know, I mean, shit.
3385606	3390489	Well, we must live in a sue happy world because that wasn't the only lawsuit that happened this week.
3390509	3393851	Capcom officially got sued by the MKR Group.
3406232	3411874	over the game Dead Rising because the MKR group, they own the rights to the movie Dawn of the Dead by George Romero.
3412134	3419396	And even though Dead Rising has a big old thing on it that says not Dawn of the Dead, essentially, I can't come back to it.
3419436	3425997	And it's interesting because I don't think they're going to win because of the fact that, I mean, can they really do 4 AM?
3427178	3430418	But they're zombies in a mall is a very narrow market.
3430478	3431619	There's just not room for both.
3431899	3432459	Yeah, yeah.
3432847	3442252	Well, the lawsuit states, quote, in both, that the recreational activities of the zombies and absurdly grotesque kill scenes provide unexpected comedic relief.
3445534	3445855	Nice.
3447495	3454079	But yeah, I kind of agree with what most of the people in chat are saying, is that they're zombies and they're in a mall.
3454359	3454920	That's it.
3455080	3460403	I mean, the characters aren't the same, the plot's not really the same, it's just zombies in a mall.
3462898	3472905	Okay, here's my other thought, is that if Capcom hadn't put that thing on the box that says it has nothing to do with Dawn of the Dead, do you think they would have gotten sued in the first place?
3475207	3481992	Because my thing is that by putting that thing on there, it's almost like they admit, yeah, there's a similarity here, but we don't intend it.
3485014	3485395	I don't know.
3485875	3486976	I think they're, you know,
3487588	3500979	because then they could claim that they were trying to trick the consumer into thinking it was a Dawn of the Dead type thing, but this is just them kind of trying to, they were trying to be preventative about it and cover their ass saying, no, this is not what it is.
3501439	3504581	They think it's one more than Dawn of the Dead.
3504641	3510766	Here's my other thing, is that, I mean, if somebody buys Dead Rising, are they not going to buy Dawn of the Dead?
3511907	3513789	You know, is that, and because, you know, to sort of,
3514828	3518369	SSJ100 Matt says, why can't they make something original like zombies eating someone's neighbors?
3518389	3518689	Oh wait.
3518709	3521690	Well the next game supposedly wasn't going to be in a mall.
3545832	3549476	No, not Zombies on a Plane, Zombies on a Train?
3549716	3550497	Zombies on Moon.
3551438	3554080	Yes, exactly, Zombies on Moon.
3554140	3560927	Well, anyway, this whole Sue happy world we live in just makes me angsty, and people just need to get over themselves, so I think we need to
3582633	3585755	It's a big SU toward drama and death.
3588456	3589056	And tragedy.
3591558	3593759	I have friends that are going through some crap.
3593899	3598521	So a big SU to the crap they're going through and the sources of said crap.
3599582	3601483	Is that it?
3601503	3601663	Yeah.
3601683	3601843	Okay.
3606052	3609296	That was a pretty heavy FU though, so not that I'm wanting there to be more.
3609857	3611539	Alright, Loki.
3611879	3615223	FU to Microsoft, and you know, kind of a little bit of rant.
3616502	3629592	I'm sure everybody's heard about the digital rights management, how it's all fucked up, where you have a console that's basically free-ringed on you, and content you purchased on there, now you can no longer use on your new console unless you're logged in live.
3630052	3632254	It's really retarded that they do that in the first place.
3632934	3640440	I've had that problem because, of course, I have a new console, even though I fixed my old console, and it's funny, it still doesn't work on my old console now either.
3641261	3641361	Um...
3645598	3647521	Why hasn't there been a lawsuit over that?
3647681	3655553	That doesn't seem actually legitimate that they can have a lawsuit over it instead of complaining about live outages or the three rings of death or whatever.
3655813	3660420	I think that they should sue them over this digital rights management stuff because if you've got content
3661090	3668414	OnLive, and now you can't use it because your system broke because they're faulty, and Microsoft isn't doing anything about it.
3669034	3669795	Absolutely nothing.
3669835	3672176	There's countless stories on the internet about this stuff.
3672256	3674557	So, why isn't anyone suing them over that?
3674638	3675418	That's what I want to know.
3678007	3681771	I just want to give an FU to the antibiotic I'm on this week.
3681811	3682872	I can't remember the name of it.
3682932	3686715	It's like Levvaquim or Leptixim or I don't know what it's called.
3686735	3689037	Some antibiotic the doctor gave me.
3689057	3693121	A, it's a brand name drug, so I have to pay more for it because they don't make a generic of it.
3693241	3696083	And B, it's the slowest antibiotic I've ever had.
3696364	3702029	I'm allergic to penicillin, so also FU to the fact that I'm allergic to penicillin because then I can just take that and I'd be better in no time.
3703436	3711283	but the antibiotic I'm on now is the slowest one I've ever taken and it was more expensive than C-Pro or any of the other ones I've taken before that are just fine.
3711804	3720853	And I know you're not supposed to take the same antibiotic as any buildup of an antibody, blah blah blah, but... No, we just now have a drug-resistant bacteria.
3721613	3722414	Is that it?
3722514	3723115	Lepoquine?
3723215	3723535	Is that it?
3723615	3725437	I don't know what the hell it's called, I can't remember.
3726538	3728420	So, F-U to my slow antibiotic, so...
3730519	3731780	And that's all my FUs of the week.
3732241	3733101	Now you can go, Jamie.
3734142	3734663	Okay.
3735604	3736464	Well, I love Sega.
3736504	3740348	I mean, if you don't love Sega, you probably have something wrong with your head.
3741469	3747994	So, this is good news for people, is that Sega Superstars Tennis will be a week early.
3748214	3753379	It was supposed to be on March 20th, and it's going to be out a week before that.
3753479	3757783	So, you have minigames, and basically it's Virtua Tennis.
3759162	3761124	It has achievements on Xbox 360.
3761164	3763546	They're named after older Sega games.
3764527	3769753	And you can play as a bunch of the Sega geeks.
3770194	3771355	So that's pretty cool.
3774418	3776420	Cool.
3777582	3780064	You know, actually, it's kind of interesting.
3793346	3798108	No real clear answer on what exactly he's working on.
3798148	3811715	They're going to be competing, obviously, with World of Warcraft and it's unavoidable that the social and massively multiplayer games have become important.
3813016	3817658	Basically, I don't know, very vague on what he's working on.
3817698	3820039	So, new multiplayer game, cool.
3821616	3822757	What it is, no idea.
3822797	3827519	Didn't he like retire from the industry or something and he opened up his restaurant?
3827539	3833602	No, he just went and bought a pizza time theater, which was Chuck E. Cheese and Showtime.
3835402	3835903	Interesting.
3836463	3838864	He had also a project anyway.
3840545	3844907	They joke though in the article that it's massively multiplayer online pong.
3845587	3847688	Yeah, that would be pretty awesome.
3847708	3849549	I don't think that would be possible.
3851616	3853837	So the drug is called Levaquin.
3854498	3855078	I looked it up.
3855379	3857100	And I just realized it's non-formulary.
3857160	3858080	That's why I paid so much.
3858120	3862083	So I have to get my doctor to try to prescribe me something that I wasn't paying too much money for.
3862103	3864264	Sorry, I just had to get that out there.
3865145	3866606	Who cares about Ponguy's MMO?
3868467	3870068	Although Chuck E. Cheese is kind of awesome.
3870268	3871529	Have you been to a Chuck E. Cheese lately?
3872030	3873411	They're really horrible now.
3882014	3883536	We had a big theater room.
3883897	3887702	It was this room that looked like a foyer to the bathroom that had glowing walls and shit.
3888002	3891687	It had hands and feet on the walls that would clap, and it had a party room with hippopotamus chickens.
3891707	3896173	Have you ever been to Bullwinkle's in the Bay Area?
3896193	3896433	No.
3897134	3899738	It's like the old school Chuck E. Cheese's.
3907406	3912087	I don't know how big goal ankles of a chain they are, but you know
3935652	3938034	I guess Rocky and Rowling aren't that popular.
3938154	3941036	I kind of want to go check it out now.
3941056	3944799	Let me see if they're still even open.
3945579	3947441	Of course, as always, John's Incredibly Shitty Dita.
3948291	3948832	You know what?
3949132	3950213	I like some of their pizza.
3950273	3950693	No, I know.
3950754	3951775	It's a funny name.
3952095	3952796	It's not a bad place.
3952916	3953636	It's just funny.
3953656	3955859	But I really like having rides inside of the place.
3955879	3956639	That is pretty fun.
3956940	3957460	Alright, anyhow.
3957901	3960103	One thing I like seeing inside a place is Street Fighter 4.
3960143	3961464	Unfortunately, I haven't seen any yet.
3961684	3963927	But if you live in some places, they have been popping up.
3964047	3966810	And over at Wired.com, they did a pretty lengthy...
3967486	3967986	Why not both?
3996212	3996893	Why not though?
3997213	4000115	Or do the old one on the Xbox, one on the Playstation 3.
4000155	4001356	That's always fun.
4001517	4004019	I missed the old Times Unlocked stuff.
4004099	4004919	I thought that was cool.
4005060	4008262	I know I've told this story before.
4008302	4009763	I used to work for an Amco arcade.
4010404	4013306	And when we had Tekken 3, it would be like, who's next?
4013807	4014828	And have an outline of them.
4015048	4021353	And because I was keeping up with the overseas releases, I would come back and tell my boss who was next.
4022274	4023655	And I found that they switched the order for
4029062	4034624	I hope that they're going to have release characters in this.
4034684	4041347	They do something like that, so you sort of have to guess who it is or anticipate something that would add a little bit more excitement to it.
4041367	4041987	You know what I mean?
4042447	4049370	Well, you know, some new characters are already being spotted in Street Fighter 4 arcade machines that are out there in the wild in the testing region.
4049850	4054992	And Sagat and Balrog have now shown up in the game, but only as bosses, like old school Street Fighter 2.
4055212	4057093	You cannot select them on the main select screen.
4058510	4059511	So, kind of interesting.
4060152	4063315	And by Balrog, it's who we have in Vega over here.
4063636	4068181	I'm not sure, because I believe it is Boxer Balrog.
4068641	4073526	Because one of these machines, I believe, is in North America, and that's where they gave this information from.
4073546	4076289	I was looking at the little video.
4076309	4078091	No, you're right, it's the US version.
4078312	4079213	So, unfortunately...
4099241	4102724	There are some restaurants outside of California.
4102764	4115272	One in Wilsonville, Oregon, Cary, North Carolina, Richmond, Virginia, Miamisburg, Ohio, and Irving, South Carolina.
4115472	4118875	It was a cool place.
4119035	4119695	It was pretty awesome.
4119715	4120256	They had a
4121607	4130252	Also, just wanted to say really quickly, all those screenshots you can see in Street Fighter 4, they all seem like they're in that upgraded version of the Chun-Li stage.
4130552	4132734	Just so you know, there are some other battle locations out there.
4132774	4133514	Here's what's showing up.
4133594	4139377	A drive-in at night, a beautiful bay in South Asia, and an inland jungle in South America.
4140038	4141979	So some more battle regions are showing up.
4142822	4146263	I was looking at the movie that's up.
4146523	4150605	It's the Cybot vs. NGS and just watching how fluid it is.
4151285	4152485	It's really cute.
4152645	4156767	It really looks like it captured a lot of the old feel of the older games.
4156967	4157567	I'm excited.
4158507	4160128	I'll definitely be checking this out when it comes out.
4160228	4161128	Arcade and console.
4161428	4163989	Now I'll tell you something that I'm not at all excited about.
4164409	4164910	What's that?
4165810	4166470	It's Road Rash.
4167190	4168131	Because I hate Road Rash.
4169571	4170832	But my husband loves Road Rash.
4171352	4171532	So...
4172972	4189880	There has been a little bit let out that the Electronic Arts CEO is talking about doing another Road Rash, which is basically a game where you're on motorcycles beating each other up.
4190620	4195963	Like we had that scene in Final Fantasy 7, where you go and beat people up.
4196003	4197423	Yeah, get a Road Rash, I remember that.
4200430	4209554	So, someone actually let a few things slip about it coming out, and that was actually Skid Row Sebastian Bach.
4209654	4225760	At a classic metal show, he said that one of his recent songs is going to be in, and to quote, actually said, it's a super heavy song, it just got picked up for some video game, Road Rage or Road Rash or something like that.
4227281	4227421	So...
4229178	4233482	Dude, who would have thought that, like, a big scoop in gaming would have come from Sebastian Bach?
4234643	4240007	And, um, EA actually said, um, uh, that Road Rash is not currently in development.
4242149	4244911	But Road Rage, that's a whole different story.
4246172	4249035	You know what, Sebastian Bach gets props for me because he was red.
4251937	4253038	He did do a good job.
4253218	4254019	By Nazis.
4254819	4255480	And, um,
4257315	4268425	PlayStation Store as well from Capcom and looks like it's going to be available for 800 Microsoft points or $10 or just $10 in real money on the PlayStation Network.
4270387	4271848	I haven't heard too much about this game.
4271868	4274971	It doesn't look that great, but I don't know.
4276793	4277554	Tread them, I believe.
4280717	4281057	All right.
4287108	4289829	There's going to be a special place in hell for them.
4290189	4291649	But apparently, here's what's happened.
4291689	4304132	There's this YouTube floating around, and there's this kid who got so excited because on Christmas Day, he opened up his presents under the tree, and he got an Xbox 360.
4304872	4307033	But unfortunately, here's what happened.
4307913	4311334	The Xbox 360 just was a box that was stuffed with clothes.
4313669	4317051	So the kids got clothes in an Xbox 360 box.
4317391	4318632	Yes, there is video.
4319932	4320593	This is so cool.
4320773	4323014	I actually haven't even watched it.
4323174	4325055	It makes you want to cry.
4326176	4326436	Poor kid.
4326476	4327917	He opens up the thing.
4329438	4330578	He's like, oh my god.
4331859	4333200	Xbox 360.
4334080	4335061	Hell yeah.
4335761	4336702	It's a core system.
4336762	4337822	I love you anyways, though.
4340124	4341284	Oh, I'm going to open it up.
4341464	4342325	He's so excited.
4343686	4344406	Are you serious?
4349610	4350990	This is so wrong.
4357815	4365019	Darketsuya in chat says, I forget which blog, but they suggested a pile of parenting books shaped like a car.
4372839	4376481	and we wonder why our kids end up so screwed up in school.
4377162	4378482	That's fucked up.
4378843	4387448	But, I don't know if you've heard about the news on this, Engadget, they've offered to find the kid and they're going to give him a real Xbox 360.
4387568	4388748	If he gets emancipated.
4391250	4393391	I threw the last part in there.
4393411	4394112	That's fucked up.
4394352	4401516	This kid's going to be in the news later on after playing the Xbox 360, later on he's going to kill his parents in the middle of the night because, you know,
4402458	4403258	You're fucked up.
4404099	4407139	And she's like, oh, I can't afford an Xbox 360.
4407340	4413922	Yet you're an asshole enough to go out there and find an empty Xbox 360 box to fill clothes with.
4414082	4415342	And they put it on the internet.
4415842	4416703	And they put it on the internet.
4416723	4417303	And it's on the internet.
4417623	4418823	Oh, that's just fucked up.
4418983	4421204	Actdeft says, man, those parents are douches.
4423125	4424065	Frisbee says, look at me.
4424085	4424625	I'm a big man.
4424665	4425405	I can laugh at my own kid.
4425425	4426566	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
4428526	4429607	Jamie, you're being awfully quiet.
4429627	4430467	I know you've got a comment.
4431997	4432537	What do you think?
4434498	4435198	Disgusting.
4435818	4436098	Yeah.
4436978	4439099	I don't think there's anything at all funny about it.
4442039	4443440	That's just really disgusting.
4446160	4449641	This is why we have kids that are just like, go to school and do dumb shit.
4449821	4450121	You know?
4450381	4452022	Because their parents teach it to them.
4453382	4454762	I mean, what's a kid gonna think?
4454782	4455343	Seriously.
4455663	4456623	My parents are assholes.
4456643	4458003	That's what you're gonna think.
4458383	4461324	Unless they just punked him with this and then like, you know...
4466422	4473204	That's what I'm wondering, is that maybe there's a second half where he actually got the Xbox later that none of us are seeing, but I don't know.
4473884	4474344	I doubt it.
4474964	4475264	Still.
4476405	4476765	Still.
4477925	4478285	Alright.
4479325	4480886	So that's all I have to say on that story.
4484967	4485807	Well, that's just
4486571	4487432	Penny Arcade Expo 10
4503822	4511544	is going to be August 29th through 31st, 2008 with the DigiPen Institute of Technology.
4511624	4519426	So they're looking for 10 independent developers that want to do their games by attendees and media and publishers.
4520946	4523686	And there's actually a panel of 50, I guess,
4527776	4536645	The industry top people who will be selecting 10 submissions they consider are going to be the best based on gameplay and length factor.
4538347	4543211	And there's also going to be one that the audience gets to vote on, an audience choice award.
4545373	4546374	That's kind of a neat idea.
4546595	4549738	I like the whole idea of bringing some independent stuff to the forefront.
4550138	4550759	That's fine.
4550799	4551460	That's pretty nice.
4551680	4551860	Yeah.
4552486	4555087	Props to these folks.
4555407	4557707	I would love to go to Penny Arcade Expo someday.
4557747	4558867	Maybe this will be my year.
4559428	4559848	Who knows?
4560908	4561288	We'll see.
4561368	4561808	I'll try.
4561828	4565629	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line very soon.
4565649	4569170	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4569570	4571770	But first, one more story.
4573871	4577232	I know this story is going to come as a shock to people.
4578032	4579292	Is this seriously breaking?
4586816	4591378	A study has been done that shows men like video games.
4593539	4594039	Shocking!
4594419	4594640	I know.
4594660	4595520	You don't say.
4596520	4597741	Absolutely shocking.
4597761	4601143	Because this study, research that has been done by
4603628	4614251	I thought men like fixed cars and went to baseball games and that's what men did.
4614271	4617212	I always thought video games were like a female thing.
4617532	4620533	Doesn't Oprah bring video games on her show and stuff?
4622094	4627776	I don't know, but it says, you know, apparently...
4632956	4640783	34 Americans showed that among males, overall console gaming came in third behind using the internet and watching TV.
4641363	4643665	I might add the internet and TV for both watching porn.
4645707	4652833	Among males 12 to 34, console gaming came in first and then dropped dramatically in older demographics.
4653833	4655775	I will be playing games until I die.
4658174	4668617	The research shows women overall would rather talk on the phone, watch a DVD, listen to music, or read a book before playing console games.
4669298	4674539	There is an odd spike among 24-year-old females for console gaming.
4675120	4679941	Three web-based games did better with females, particularly among women of mature age.
4680701	4682522	No real shocking revelations, of course.
4684059	4686801	Actdeft in chat says, LOL stereotypes.
4687921	4693484	Son of Pat says, where was masturbation on the list?
4693504	4694725	That must have been number four.
4696946	4699307	No, that just isn't included with all the topics.
4699387	4704310	You have to understand, I do everything alphabetically, so it's Matt and then masturbation.
4704450	4706491	Janai says, read a book, read a book.
4714080	4721326	I'm thinking that, you know, there's probably a lot of women out there who like video games too, and I think there's also a lot of men who don't like video games.
4721386	4723027	I know that might be a shock for some people.
4723888	4731173	Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR using Skype or Zones Radio, but first, we have some voicemails to catch up on.
4732281	4737602	Sometimes when we're not live, some of the folks who like to listen to our podcast and so on, they like to leave us voicemails.
4737762	4739882	So we want to get some of those out of the way real quick.
4739942	4741263	So I'm going to start with this one.
4742583	4743863	Hi, guys.
4744643	4755385	I don't have a thing on your forums, but I'm known as Vaginator on the PlayStation Network, and I'm also known as Deere on Final Fantasy XI.
4756405	4759306	I just want to say, yes, guys, that's a great show.
4759346	4760346	I kiss it every week.
4761218	4764860	and I did have a couple questions to you.
4764880	4778746	First of all, if you've ever seen any kind of rumors as to a sequel to Final Fantasy XI and could you provide any details if you know any?
4779867	4786129	Secondly, I heard that Survival was a really great game and what not.
4786290	4789191	We had something like 20 million players give or take.
4790674	4794356	But the thing is though, I want to play it, but I don't have the PC.
4794856	4802160	Is there any chance in hell that you'll be coming to consoles anytime soon?
4802180	4804722	Specifically, PlayStation 3?
4806423	4807743	If you don't, it'll be great.
4808464	4812346	Because right now my MMOs are really limited.
4813447	4816909	Any advice you guys have would be great.
4817089	4817409	Thank you.
4818657	4819998	Thank you very much for the voicemail.
4820978	4833244	You know, I'm thinking that where you're getting the impression that developers are working on the sequel is because it has come out that the people behind Final Fantasy XI, that team, is working on another MMO, but it hasn't been said what it is they're working on.
4833304	4843288	I think a lot of people are assuming it's Final Fantasy XI too, but I honestly think if they are going to make another MMO, it's not going to be Final Fantasy XIV or any of that.
4843628	4845489	I think they may make
4846256	4848257	A new MMO with some of the same concepts.
4848277	4848797	But I don't know.
4849037	4851057	Would it sell as well without the Final Fantasy name?
4851217	4851697	I don't know.
4851817	4852898	A Kingdom Hearts MMO?
4852938	4853318	Maybe.
4853618	4854098	Who knows?
4855058	4857299	But there's nothing out there concrete at this time.
4857539	4863800	You can probably betcha that they'll try to crank at least one more expansion out of Final Fantasy XI before it's done.
4864100	4866121	I know some people said this last one that came out, the...
4868669	4872712	Not the time one, not Treasures of Otter again, but the one that just came out.
4873172	4874113	Why can't I remember the name?
4874774	4875614	Wings of the Goddess?
4875714	4876635	Thank you very much.
4876655	4877315	Wings of the Goddess.
4877956	4879897	A lot of people said this is the last one.
4879957	4880398	I don't know.
4880718	4885041	You'd think if they did like 12 expansions for EverQuest, they could get at least one more out of this, I think.
4885401	4889204	At least to hold the Final Fantasy XI fans over until the real sequel comes out.
4889604	4890085	But I don't know.
4891206	4896930	Nothing concrete is that anything you hear out there is speculation alone.
4897569	4899250	One more voice mail for you guys.
4900310	4901311	Hey, it's Missy.
4902952	4907014	It's Wednesday, and I'm waiting for my mom at work, so I'm bored.
4907034	4915338	Plus, I got the TFP script stuff for the holiday, so I thought I'd call, test it out, maybe be the first.
4918019	4919019	I ordered a modem.
4919300	4924042	It hasn't shipped yet, but it's shipping from Memphis, so when it does, it should get to me quick.
4927550	4933475	I miss you guys, plus, oh, and guess what I did on Sunday since I couldn't listen?
4934535	4949006	I didn't have any questions up at the clock, even though it was 8 my time, so I ran an episode in my playlist and listened to it like I was listening to it live.
4949266	4951888	I can't really recall the episode number of it,
4952682	4954824	But it was fucking hilarious.
4955244	4957807	I think he had the reverse cage match in it.
4961310	4962151	It should never happen.
4962491	4964093	I'm sure many of you know what it is.
4964113	4970979	I'm kind of paranoid that somebody's going to eject my computer while I'm not looking.
4971359	4975703	So I'm going to go ahead and say bye, and with luck I should see y'all live Sunday.
4975983	4976304	Bye!
4977657	4978497	Couple comments from chat.
4978537	4980518	Ranma says, sounds like she's walking and talking.
4980578	4981259	I kind of agree.
4981619	4984340	SJ100 Matt says, is Misty the first PSP Sky caller?
4984380	4985881	I believe she is.
4986181	4990223	I was trying to be number one, but I had the wrong... You got beat!
4991464	4995506	No, that's definitely one reason I wanted to play that, is because that would be the first PSP call we've gotten.
4995546	4996126	So there you have it.
5027077	5030019	But yeah, I think that's really neat that she puts on the old episodes.
5030039	5031821	We do need to release more of the old episodes.
5032621	5034483	One of those projects I'll never get to.
5036224	5038666	Anyhow, let's open up the skyline for all y'all.
5038726	5040787	It's now wide open for everybody to call in.
5040887	5043629	Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OL
5063476	5064396	Let's go ahead and take a call.
5064676	5065576	Hi everyone, Tom's Radio.
5065596	5065957	Who's this?
5067157	5067917	Legend of Zaku.
5068177	5069097	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
5069117	5069737	What's on your mind?
5070838	5075239	Nah, just chilling right here recovering from the hickeys I got from clubbing last night.
5075939	5078479	But that's besides the point.
5078719	5090782	Just wanted to, you know, probably point out, you know, the whole clusterfuck that's basic, you know, that Nintendo has created as a result of their attempts to create an online multiplayer game.
5094378	5095539	And it got bad.
5095559	5107768	I mean, it's bad enough when people, like, they have to wait in front of, like, 10, 20, 30 guys outside of Nintendo World every morning just to get to school a week.
5108308	5118375	And then, you know, you take it home, you realize that, you know, there's barely an online experience to begin with.
5119136	5121097	But what about the children, Daku?
5121117	5122178	What about the children?
5122639	5124963	Well, that's playing to the Disney vote.
5125084	5126967	You know, the Soccer Mom vote.
5127468	5129311	But who's buying weed, Zach?
5129351	5130353	Who's Soccer Mom?
5131054	5131575	Of course.
5131616	5132898	That's your demographic.
5133359	5151124	And they're playing the Disney card because, you know, think about what would happen if someone were to catch them off guard by trying to do something that allowed the other players to basically curse in a madness tangent like they did on Xbox Live.
5151664	5152664	It would be a shitstorm.
5152704	5157566	Fox News for example would just spin the shit out of the Wii's image.
5161969	5166190	Their eyes are being raped by the hideous voice chat inside Mario Kart Wii.
5166670	5169150	How do these rape your children tonight on Fox?
5169310	5180513	If you're basically playing Mario Kart or, you know, voice chat or anything like that, the only thing I worry about is ActHeft.
5181313	5184373	And, you know, ActHeft just ruining the experience for everyone.
5185273	5185654	I don't know.
5185714	5188074	But at the same time, you know, it's like, put me
5192569	5196911	with Nintendo saying, no communication between strangers, period.
5198312	5207236	But with this whole friend code thing, you know, I would think that, you know, once you have a friend code thing, you should be able, if you want to say fucking shit, you should be able to do that.
5208157	5216641	Right, I mean, I don't know, I guess I kind of, you know, I kind of go, you know, kind of basically take the way, if not, you know, go
5219179	5227664	I mean, yeah, that might be one thing, but I don't know if it would be enough to fill the fears of the software market.
5227764	5230306	Okay, quick question, Zach, a quick question, then we've got to wrap up.
5230666	5244454	GS68 says, and he's quoting something you said earlier in chat, he says, you say that Xbox Live, they say, you know, N-I-G, blah, blah, blah, F-A, blah, blah, blah, and all that they say on Xbox Live, yet you bitch about Nintendo's online.
5248646	5249886	Not enough, what's the answer?
5250366	5251987	I don't know, I mean, look, think about it.
5252347	5257068	I mean, you can mute, in Xbox Live, I know you can mute people, right?
5257848	5267591	And even though Nintendo is basically doing the mute for you, you don't even have that option to decide whether they're, like, rude, obnoxious players.
5283851	5285471	Here's my last question for you, Zaku.
5285711	5293835	As much as you or I may hate to admit it, is this change, is this revelation about the online thing and Mario Kart Online, is it going to affect sales?
5294645	5303173	I doubt it, I mean, most people, you know, most people will even, I doubt that many people will even take advantage of all, you know, the online features anyway.
5303333	5313401	I mean, some will, but I think it's more important in that sense that some people will share amongst friends, you know, with, you know, with food and liquor and stuff like that.
5313461	5318706	It's not that the Wii is a social video game conference that's, you know, that's going to have that
5326001	5334146	I hope you heard the bonus statement tonight, by the way.
5334166	5337127	There was some very exciting news for you in there.
5337147	5340049	1877-GAME-OL, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
5340069	5340870	Let's go to another call.
5340910	5341830	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5341850	5342090	Who's this?
5342111	5345693	Hi, this is Actdeft in chat.
5345913	5347014	Hi, Actdeft in chat.
5347054	5347374	How are you?
5347394	5348114	What's on your mind, buddy?
5350095	5350996	Just fucking out.
5351116	5352017	I want to talk about...
5353564	5353904	Thank you.
5353924	5360207	Talk up in the bonus segment about the March Madness that DMN is organizing.
5360387	5374693	Yes, and just so our podcast listeners know, because they don't always get to hear the bonus segment, because we do something bonus, DMN, one of our weeknight shows, I believe it is the shows on Wednesdays, the Insanest Hour, he is putting together the Top 64.
5374773	5379355	He's doing this March Madness thing with the 64 games going face-off against each other.
5379395	5380675	All the listeners submitted in their list.
5380956	5382016	And during the bonus segment tonight, the
5387930	5393752	You and Loki made a vote for one of the brackets.
5394653	5399295	It was Ocarina of Time and Kirby Superstar.
5399355	5399675	Yes.
5400616	5410400	I want to say that I'm with you, though not for the same reason, but just because I do think that Kirby Superstar is a better game than Ocarina of Time.
5410871	5411711	Yeah, here's the thing.
5411731	5414973	Loki and I made a controversial vote during the bonus segment of this whole thing.
5415093	5418115	We voted for Kirby Superstar over Ocarina of Time.
5418595	5426519	And both of us said it's because basically we both agree that Ocarina of Time is one of the most, by the gaming community in general, overrated games there is.
5426760	5430141	Yeah, I've tried playing it and I can't stand it.
5430542	5433603	When Zelda went 3D for me, it just didn't work.
5433643	5435224	Even Wind Waker, or not Wind Waker.
5435264	5436125	Wind Waker is fine.
5436145	5437766	I like Wind Waker and I like the
5443124	5445005	It's not like I think it's a bad game.
5445065	5450488	I don't care for the more mature-looking length.
5450508	5460133	I don't like the 3D ones that are on the Nintendo 64, and I didn't really get into... And I just love the Super Nintendo ones so, so much.
5460153	5462714	That's one of my favorite games of all time, is Link to the Past.
5462734	5463154	Seriously.
5463474	5466076	Okay, maybe it's more solid talking about...
5467246	5475074	For me, Charity Superstar is the better game there because Charity Superstar is like many games in one.
5475554	5478277	Many adventure games, also multiplayer games.
5479638	5484943	And basically, although the story in it, or the many stories in it,
5485868	5499479	aren't as deep as Ocarina of Time, so you can have a better time playing it, and even replaying it, like Great Table Sense of Death is one of the games there.
5500199	5504602	It's basically an adventure game that you gotta find treasures.
5505683	5512809	I think there's like 100 treasures you have to find, and it's very difficult to do it in one simple run.
5512829	5515611	You have to replay it again and again to get
5516238	5520000	Actdeft, but maybe you just want to admit that maybe a little bit you're just a Kirby fanboy.
5521321	5521721	Maybe.
5522081	5525063	So, I do like Ocarina of Time.
5525103	5535128	Maybe it's one of my favorite games of all time, but I just want to make that point that maybe Ocarina of Time is not that great of a game.
5535248	5536769	It's not all that in the bag of chips.
5537890	5539751	I'm sure there's...
5548732	5555255	and we have ours and I'm sure many of you have been asked the emails we get this week about how we hate Ocarina of Time, which isn't true, we like it.
5555295	5557215	Yeah, different show port, different port.
5557295	5557695	Exactly.
5557756	5559456	If you want to put it that way, then fine.
5559476	5562477	Alright, Actdeft, any other comments you have for our listeners tonight?
5564278	5569300	Just, I want to say that I already got my ticket for Video Game Scribe, so in two weeks,
5574587	5575348	Alright, sounds good.
5575368	5577049	Take care Actdeft, have fun at Video Games Live.
5577089	5582973	If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call, 877-GAME-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1
5603852	5607934	Well, a couple of things about the whole Nintendo Online thing.
5607954	5620939	Well, I don't blame them for saying it like the preset text chat and all that, but when friends get together and play, it is the most rowdiness ever.
5621139	5627882	I mean, really, if I'm going to be playing Mario Kart Online with my friends, I don't want to curse like a sailor.
5627962	5628662	I want to say this.
5628723	5629703	I want to say that.
5630443	5630843	You do.
5630863	5631344	I want it.
5633021	5651992	Me too, and the weird thing is that thanks to technology, I'm still going to do that, whether it be this whole Ventrilo thing, or the, I love the idea of, I think it was even Loki or a chatter that said this, you sign on to the Xbox 360, and do your chat on the 360, and then play the Wii.
5652032	5656214	For me, I'll just bring my laptop next to the Wii, and I'll just put my headset on, and just like,
5669520	5675946	I think it depends on the fact that they're a quote-unquote family company, family gaming console and stuff like that, you know?
5676226	5679950	They're scared shitless about online, is what it is.
5680370	5684054	Janai in chat says, but it's more fun when it's multiplayer offline.
5685435	5690340	Oh, yeah, I mean, honestly, when I get Mario Kart Wii, I'm going to be busy the whole time.
5691114	5695899	I gotta say though, Jani, sometimes that's not an option though.
5695919	5700664	You know, one of the beautiful things about the internet is that it brings people together.
5700684	5703246	One reason I'm so obsessed with WoW to the point you guys make fun
5713564	5716225	You know, I get to play with some of my friends I don't see on a regular basis.
5716265	5719746	For instance, one of my closest friends lives in Kansas, so we play that way.
5719826	5723027	And, you know, we also have a guy in our guild who's from Idaho who's hilarious.
5723327	5725128	And, yeah, there's a bunch of local people on there, too.
5725168	5728649	But we have a good time, you know, just laughing and playing the game and, you know, all that.
5728669	5732830	And then there's, you know, a lot of our listeners, you know, we get to play games on DS sometimes.
5732850	5734831	I get to play with people in New York City and all that stuff.
5734871	5740253	So, you know, sometimes the Internet really helps fill in that void that we can't have people on the couch.
5741013	5741493	True, true.
5742853	5744534	All right, any other thoughts, Ranma, before we let you go?
5745274	5745995	Yeah, a couple things.
5746035	5749497	Number one, remember what you said earlier about a Hello Kitty PlayStation 3?
5749877	5750157	Yes.
5751458	5753339	I thought you had a thing for Batch Maroon.
5754292	5760476	It is the Batsamaru thing, not a Hello Kitty thing, but I've just accepted the fact that people are just going to loop it all on the same thing.
5760516	5764198	And when I say Batsamaru is Sanrio, they're going to just go, oh, you like Hello Kitty.
5764558	5767940	Plus there's the whole fact that I have the toaster and the coffee maker, which doesn't help.
5767960	5775145	They don't make, like, if they came out with a Batsamaru toaster, I would sell that thing to my Hello Kitty one at a garage sale so quick and replace it.
5775165	5776246	But they just, they don't do it.
5776306	5777406	No love for paint ones.
5777526	5777967	No love.
5778007	5781509	So that's my, so that's my, they have the Hello Kitty.
5785546	5788109	You know, I was surprised no one got me the waffle maker for Christmas.
5788129	5790191	So many people said they were going to give me the waffle maker.
5790211	5793815	But it was one of the things where I think no one wanted to buy it because they all thought everyone else was getting it.
5794496	5797899	Which is funny.
5797999	5802364	And before I go, when I went to Capcom a couple of weeks ago, a couple of interesting things.
5802664	5804386	Number one, the game room.
5804667	5807730	They had a 32-inch HD TV set up.
5808191	5811032	What's an Atari 7800 playing Mario Brothers?
5811533	5812953	That is fucking hardcore.
5813033	5831962	You know, I have to admit, I have to admit, when I was at the record store this weekend that also sells the old games, and I saw some of the games that they had on the 2600, like Combat and Warlords and all that stuff, I was like, man, how fun would it be just for one day to hook up the Atari 2600 games to the TV, the big HD TV, and just have a brawl?
5832543	5834245	Rob, come over.
5834705	5836427	We'll hook up the 5200.
5836527	5837928	Let Justin TV that shit.
5838569	5846757	I want to actually have the 5200 hooked up, because even though the controllers broke really easily, I would totally love to get a Kix game going on.
5846817	5849519	I want some epic kaboom.
5850040	5851261	I want some HD kaboom.
5852122	5853403	I love Kangaroo.
5859315	5861677	We need to do that one weekend.
5861857	5865259	I think one weekend we need to just marathon the shit out of old school Atari games.
5865439	5866520	Why don't we do this?
5866580	5867821	How about twice a month?
5867841	5869883	You know, we can manage the time.
5869923	5874486	We pick an old console, hook that shit up, and play it.
5874506	5877909	You're talking about my, you know, vault in my house.
5877949	5878489	Yeah, I know.
5878629	5880671	Well, if we can get the time, we can do it.
5880851	5881211	It does.
5881451	5883673	Do you have to bring over Clicovision and television?
5884926	5885746	Let's make it happen.
5885806	5888167	Let's not let this go the way the Super Mentor would think.
5888188	5889968	We set a time, we set a date, and we do it.
5890028	5892870	I bring over the Justin TV cam so the chatters can enjoy it too.
5892910	5895571	We'll point it at the TV and just go to town.
5895851	5896251	Let's do it.
5896471	5896871	Let's do it.
5896911	5897172	When?
5900613	5908877	Um... Okay, we can't set a time right now because we have to consult our calendars, but Ranma, you're in charge of bitching at us until it happens.
5909357	5910318	Let's do it in early April.
5911078	5911358	Alright.
5911458	5913239	We have to wait that long?
5913703	5914343	Oh, that's right.
5914363	5917825	Alright, so Ranma, you stay on our asses until it happens, alright?
5917885	5918165	Alright.
5918185	5919565	We gotta let you go, Ranma.
5940578	5945219	Relax, go to your room, change your underwear, and go back to play, okay?
5945419	5946480	Relax.
5946620	5949140	The line was like going all over the place.
5949180	5953261	Yes, you had to go to rock and roll, but everybody was there to play Brawl.
5953742	5955102	This is being clear.
5955162	5957743	Each 500 copies per se.
5957883	5959463	But, you know what?
5959523	5963684	You were looking at Brawl's target audience at that place.
5963704	5964264	You know what I mean?
5965825	5968486	Of course, a lot of people that go to anime cons are excited about Brawl.
5968506	5969706	Most of them are Nintendo fanboys.
5971837	5975260	But still, I mean, you've got people my age going that's over four.
5976080	5977522	It's going to be a huge dollar.
5977582	5978542	I'm not doubting you on that, Ranma.
5978562	5979343	It's going to be a huge dollar.
5979503	5980024	We've got to let you go.
5980044	5981445	This call's going on for very, very long.
5981465	5982926	But thank you so much as always.
5983226	5984087	Take care, buddy.
5984727	5986409	Sorry, this is getting to seven minutes.
5986809	5988731	I'm trying to keep them at four minutes now.
5989191	5990592	One more call, we're wrapping up.
5990612	5991633	Let's see, how far are we in the show?
5991653	5992814	Oh my God, almost two hours.
5992834	5994055	I think we've got to wrap up.
5994215	5997898	That's just part B. Because the bonus, our bonus statement tonight was 15 minutes.
5997918	5998578	It's 9.30 here.
5998618	6000480	We've got to end this shit.
6001069	6004174	So, that being said, quickly, Loki, any last-minute stories?
6004935	6007699	Yes, I have last-minute stories for you.
6007739	6008039	Alright.
6008640	6011985	Okay, LEGO MMO, we know and love that they
6030173	6033175	You Don't Know Jack has become part of Yahoo Games.
6033655	6037117	Resident Evil Zero is coming to the Wii in Japan to support the NQ thing.
6037177	6038317	A Finnish company...
6057861	6063063	Game Studio, has filed papers to trademark Pwnage.
6064184	6066104	Yes, they're trying to trademark Pwnage.
6066284	6067885	What, they can put it on shirts and stuff?
6068245	6068866	I don't know why.
6069246	6069746	Interesting.
6071807	6072407	Let's see.
6072887	6077229	Then, the PlayStation Store is apparently going to be overhauled in April.
6077249	6085732	It's going to look more like the Thing Store, which, you know, a little different, a little bit easier to navigate, so that's kind of cool.
6085752	6087153	We'll look for that in April there.
6088284	6092187	Um, Initial D Arcade Stage 4 is headed to PS3.
6092227	6093848	That's pretty cool.
6094428	6094789	Wow.
6094929	6096510	Not a game I'm going to be importing, though.
6096530	6097651	I learned my lesson the first time.
6097671	6100192	Did the other Initial D games come out on consoles?
6100272	6102114	I don't think they ever did.
6102134	6103094	They're not here.
6103274	6105296	And they had an Initial D on the PSP as well.
6105316	6107177	I had a PSP one.
6108118	6110159	Lastly, to piss off people even more,
6121229	6125090	There's even a sketch of a Spartan done by the Rooster Teeth guys.
6126371	6131512	Anyways, his 360 died and has a free ring, so he sent it in to get fixed.
6131572	6137534	He even, you know, took precautions of asking them, hey, you know, can you send this back to me in the same case?
6137775	6140756	If not, you know, can you make sure you put the new case on the new system?
6141176	6142016	That kind of stuff.
6142656	6143917	Well, he gets it back.
6143937	6145077	His serial number is mapped.
6160664	6162646	Why would they do that in the first place?
6162706	6164227	Why would you rub something off?
6165147	6168049	I mean, that's just being a dick, is what that is.
6170131	6172192	And I know one that also didn't make a cut.
6173713	6181039	The singing store is also going to be getting 67 songs in the next update, which I believe is supposed to happen in April as well.
6182099	6183000	No problem with those 67.
6190146	6193206	Alright, well, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
6193646	6194947	DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight.
6194967	6195587	Your final thoughts.
6195807	6196327	Tired.
6197347	6200428	My final thought is wine is good.
6200448	6201489	Plum wine was good.
6201829	6202629	Loki, your final thought.
6202889	6204569	My final thought is I'm still working on that 360.
6204970	6207310	It's still being done.
6208110	6215232	Alright, well, after our amazing February of fail, we hope March has been a good month to you guys so far.
