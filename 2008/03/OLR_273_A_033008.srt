00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:23,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 30th, 2008, Gamers4Hackers get the SmackDown from Microsoft, Rockband is announced for the Wii, and is another PSP redesign on the way?

2
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:37,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:44,323
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:45,683
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:50,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:50,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Roar.

7
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:51,767
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

8
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, I'm scared.

9
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:53,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Roar.

10
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Things going good for you?

11
00:00:58,952 --> 00:00:59,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly decently.

12
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:00,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah.

13
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:03,587
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

14
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:25,629
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the announcement about, you know, I had to make decisions about what the hell's going to happen with the show, the station going offline.

15
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the show, but the station going offline in a couple weeks.

16
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:29,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow I did the math wrong when I looked at the calendar.

17
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:33,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought tonight was the last show on Life is Five, but it's actually next Saturday.

18
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:33,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Or next...

19
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently I still can't read a calendar.

20
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:40,094
[SPEAKER_05]: It's next Sunday is going to be the last show on Life's Easy Five.

21
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I somehow missed that there was one more week in March.

22
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:43,417
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever.

23
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:44,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we are on March 30th.

24
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:48,460
[SPEAKER_05]: April 6th will be the last show on LifeEasyFive.com.

25
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And then April 13th, something else, which we'll get to in a little bit.

26
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:54,644
[SPEAKER_05]: The future of Orange Lounge Radio.

27
00:01:55,024 --> 00:02:00,748
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about that in a little bit, but I wouldn't want to get away from how we usually start things off with.

28
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:01,709
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

29
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

30
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:07,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very Ragnarok-ing, as usual.

31
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:17,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I turned on my DS to play some Final Fantasy VI, and then turned it off promptly, because I ran out of time.

32
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was pretty much it.

33
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:27,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and we were going to be able to get another pinball machine, but that fell through.

34
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:30,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Which pinball machine?

35
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:31,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Attack from Mars.

36
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:33,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I like that one.

37
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:34,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and Will to buy it, um...

38
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:03,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Bang Bar, the Uber Rare Table, what pinball table would you like to own more than anything?

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I actually have a pan list of a couple.

40
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:43,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one of them would actually be, um, Black Knight 2000.

41
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have actually a Black Knight right now that we're borrowing.

42
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:51,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh god, I know what this is called.

43
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,512
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, um, it's one that's like an airplane theme, like a jet theme.

44
00:03:55,172 --> 00:04:00,275
[SPEAKER_02]: They had it, um, at Pentagogo, and it was, um, the whole game was like nothing but ramps.

45
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:01,396
[SPEAKER_02]: WorldCupSoccer94

46
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,011
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the machine to me.

47
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:30,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the one I want.

48
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,072
[SPEAKER_05]: And the husband's not allowed to sell that ever.

49
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:32,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.

50
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:37,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have the other one that I really like, which is Twilight Zone.

51
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:38,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cool.

52
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:43,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So those two were up there for my two favorite tables.

53
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually are still trying to get me a Doctor Who.

54
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:47,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

55
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost bought the TARDIS out of a Doctor Who on eBay.

56
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:51,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, like,

57
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:55,437
[SPEAKER_04]: A Tommy machine wouldn't be bad.

58
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:56,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a giant pinball on top.

59
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the Jurassic Park pinball.

60
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:17,006
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one I was like, because the big dinosaur came down and ate your ball.

61
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,908
[SPEAKER_05]: But my favorite table ever was that in the family game.

62
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:20,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that one.

63
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:23,210
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a Simpsons pinball party.

64
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:24,951
[SPEAKER_02]: That machine's a bitch.

65
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:26,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?

66
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:26,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.

67
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:28,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, is that one hard.

68
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:31,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan got rid of my Rocky and Bullwinkle, which I really liked.

69
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:36,179
[SPEAKER_02]: But Stern is bringing out a new Indiana Jones table.

70
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I mentioned that.

71
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:39,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

72
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think last week.

73
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:40,562
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's cool.

74
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:41,543
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

75
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:41,863
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

76
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:43,590
[SPEAKER_02]: The market's still there.

77
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,091
[SPEAKER_05]: There definitely is still a market for pinball.

78
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:48,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun, and there's still rabid fans for that.

79
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:50,573
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're getting off base.

80
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:52,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone's playing Klonoa 2.

81
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:52,954
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

82
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:57,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone in chat's playing Klonoa 2, and that game's fucking awesome and very depressing.

83
00:05:57,596 --> 00:06:04,100
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what would bring pinball back is if they made a way to make it competitive against a couple teams.

84
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually had sort of like a cocktail machine that had two sides on it.

85
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:19,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at Classic Gaming Expo, and I think I've seen it there, and at Pentagogo, they have the versus tables, but those are, they're not very fun.

86
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:27,514
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join our chat room so Jamie can have random outbursts at the games you're playing this week, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go do it.

87
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:33,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, Loki, I'm thinking you're going to bring us back to console games with your gaming week.

88
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:33,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

89
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:39,405
[SPEAKER_04]: This week I played Crisis Core, so that was pretty cool.

90
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:44,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely a lot different than, say, your typical Final Fantasy RPG.

91
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it's too similar to 12.

92
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:50,827
[SPEAKER_04]: The combat system's sort of real-time, I guess.

93
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:54,988
[SPEAKER_04]: You run around and you kind of mash buttons, but it's okay.

94
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:55,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

95
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:58,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Very linear so far, but like I said, I'm not that far in the game.

96
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:03,217
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it continues the way it is, it's a very linear game.

97
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,238
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's fun so far.

98
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Love the cutscenes, though.

99
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,160
[SPEAKER_04]: The cutscenes are pretty awesome.

100
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've also played Saints Row, actually the single player, because I'm trying to finish it before Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out.

101
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:17,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost done with the game, though.

102
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:18,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on the last third.

103
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:29,369
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I played just some weird stuff that we'll be probably getting into later like that Romjack Fail and Tetroid 2012.

104
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,551
[SPEAKER_04]: That game's weird.

105
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:36,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Tetris and Silent Hill with Arkanoid.

106
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:43,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to see this because when Loki says it's Tetris meets Silent Hill I'm like what the hell is that supposed to mean?

107
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:43,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

108
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:44,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird though.

109
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

110
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,720
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta check it out.

111
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I will.

112
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:47,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

113
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:50,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's pretty much it.

114
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:54,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I may have played a little bit of Brawl in there, too, at some point.

115
00:07:55,528 --> 00:08:05,792
[SPEAKER_04]: The cool thing, though, because mainly this entire week I've been busy trying to get that stupid 360 working, the second one that went down, and finally fixed it, actually.

116
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:13,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, at a certain point, it's always when I just say, okay, fuck it, it's not going to work ever again, I'm just going to go all out and, you know.

117
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,325
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

118
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:49,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have one more to go, but this one was a lot easier because I bought a replacement warranty sticker, so I'm going to slap that on there and put the old case back on there and send it to Microsoft.

119
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:51,138
[SPEAKER_04]: This one, no work involved.

120
00:08:51,738 --> 00:09:00,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, three out of six have broken, but I fixed two out of the three, so that's not bad so far.

121
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:03,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

122
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:04,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else to report?

123
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:05,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing else?

124
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:05,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

125
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:07,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much it.

126
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:11,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we'll have some cool stuff to show Justin.TV later.

127
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:11,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

128
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:14,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, that's about it.

129
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:17,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Justin.TV, we do have a webcam feed of our show.

130
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:18,648
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of crap tonight.

131
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:18,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

132
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:19,909
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wi-Fi is kind of...

133
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,388
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

134
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:49,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've played the game a million times, but it's still one of my favorites from, you know, way back yonder.

135
00:09:49,671 --> 00:10:03,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was playing like Root Beer Tapper, Tempest, and some of the other things on Xbox Live that are, you know, they're not like scream up and down and shout and type wonderful games, but, you know, they are classics.

136
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:06,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them, I don't even like the upgraded versions of some of them.

137
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:10,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't think I like the upgraded version of Tempest nearly as much as the original.

138
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:14,331
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if it's just like, I can't see as much of what's going on or what have you, but

139
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:18,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I got like some old achievements that for some reason I never got.

140
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:20,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was kind of fun.

141
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:31,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also checked out that new release, Tikal or Tikal, Tikal, whatever that new puzzle game is on Xbox Live this week, which is OK.

142
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:40,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like Tetris meets Luminous, sort of like you have to make the little blocks that you do in Luminous, but you make them with Tetris shaped pieces in different colors.

143
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not just two colors.

144
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,441
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like four different colors.

145
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:44,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of.

146
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,890
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:08,360
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet, I don't believe this game is a PopCap game.

148
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's made by somebody else.

149
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the game itself has nothing to do with Zuma.

150
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the games themselves are completely separate, except for the fact they're both puzzle-ish games.

151
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,648
[SPEAKER_04]: They have that other one, too, that's just like kind of Zuma, or the same tribal thing.

152
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, um... Not Crystal Quest.

153
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,453
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, um... Oh, Miss, uh, Magnetica.

154
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:29,514
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.

155
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:30,475
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not like Zuma.

156
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:31,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the tribal thing.

157
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:32,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an Xbox Live Arcade game.

158
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:34,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, uh, Jewel Quest.

159
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:35,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Jewel Quest, yeah.

160
00:11:35,138 --> 00:11:35,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

161
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:42,318
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jewel Quest is like bejeweled with one little twist to it.

162
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:43,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

163
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:48,960
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't end up really buying the full version of it because the demo gives you a really good taste of the game.

164
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I don't know.

165
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:56,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't keep justifying these little $5 and $10 purchases for games I'm not going to play more than a couple times.

166
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:58,744
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that.

167
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:02,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Some days I do wish Xbox Live would switch to that model of you just pay...

168
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Tickle Tickle

169
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:28,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Tickle.

170
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:31,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Tickle.

171
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:32,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Gerardimo says Tickle.

172
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,765
[SPEAKER_05]: A mashup of good puzzle games.

173
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did you expect it to be decent?

174
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I like puzzle games.

175
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:39,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say it's decent.

176
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It just didn't wow me.

177
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:43,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the first time I played Luminous, I was like, this game is the shit.

178
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:44,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this game.

179
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:48,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't wow me, but it wasn't horrible either.

180
00:12:49,653 --> 00:13:00,696
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I did during my gaming week, you know I'm like, I think I mentioned this a couple weeks ago on the show, I've been really late to the Steam bandwagon, you know, on the PC, getting Steam and checking that out, which is kind of like,

181
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:06,736
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Fire meets Xbox Live meets an online-type store kind of thing on your PC.

182
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:11,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded that a couple weeks ago, and I finally bought a game this week.

183
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:20,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And the game I bought was Portal, because Loki finally took his copy of the Orange Box back a little while ago, and I was very sad I couldn't play that on an Xbox 360 anymore.

184
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:24,723
[SPEAKER_05]: But the only game in there I was really, really missing and wanting to play again was Portal.

185
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:26,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you what.

186
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:28,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Big difference.

187
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:38,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know this is like a classic debate, but it's not something I often think about because I do most of my gaming on console and, you know, World of Warcraft on the PC and a couple other things here and there.

188
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:45,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't often think about this, but there really is a world of difference between keyboard and mouse and two analog sticks.

189
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:52,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I actually do a lot better with a keyboard and mouse than I do analog sticks.

190
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:53,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a classic debate.

191
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,412
[SPEAKER_05]: People say, this is better, this is better.

192
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:58,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I might actually be a little better at Halo if I could use a keyboard and mouse in it.

193
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I know I could get Halo 2 and Vista, but I don't have Vista.

194
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:10,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can also get one of the, they have the T-Mix Acuter stuff that you can buy that you can hook up a keyboard and mouse and do it that way.

195
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:15,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like how you actually fire the portal gun with a PC, your left or right click.

196
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:18,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a little bit more intuitive.

197
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:19,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

198
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:26,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like the feel of it on the PC a little better than I did on the Xbox 360.

199
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:32,647
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the Xbox 360, I could still play that on my big screen TV, and it was loud, and it was nice.

200
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:37,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one, whereas I have a widescreen monitor out here, it's not very big, but it's still pretty.

201
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:39,533
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, same game.

202
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:42,180
[SPEAKER_05]: You know we love Portal here at Orange Lounge Radio.

203
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a lot to say about the game, but just kind of making that transition was very interesting because it's the exact same game, just playing it two different ways.

204
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:51,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I actually do a lot better with the mouse.

205
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:59,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think part of what Jamie said has a lot to do with that, just the way you control the firing and just the movement is different and all that.

206
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,528
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me a minute to get used to moving, though.

207
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:08,536
[SPEAKER_05]: because sometimes with the whole WASD, I think if you hit two of them at the same time, it gets confused.

208
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little unlike World of Warcraft, which also does a WASD, but anyway.

209
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:20,501
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I will say about the difference on there too, just for perspective, I get more motion sick watching it on a TV.

210
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:26,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it because it's just bigger, and so more of your vision is taken up by the images?

211
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:28,664
[SPEAKER_01]: That could possibly be it.

212
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:32,326
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was watching on a widescreen laptop before.

213
00:15:34,581 --> 00:16:01,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Ross Steel UT in chat says Street Fighter would be an atrocity on a keyboard and mouse yeah I remember an old actually I had Street Fighter 2 Turbo Super Duper whatever it was the last big one they did they had a computer version of it on CD that had Redbook audio for the different stages like redone music and so yeah I had that on the PC and I played it on the keyboard and it's just not the same it's just not the same and then I go way way back and I think about Stick Fighter

214
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick Fighter is fucking awesome.

215
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:04,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody ever play Stick Fighter?

216
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:06,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that game back in the day?

217
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:11,596
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've never played Stick Fighter, it's got to be out there on the internet somewhere.

218
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of those like back in the shareware days.

219
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:16,718
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably have to get a slowdown program to make it work okay.

220
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:22,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine it's like way, but Stick Fighter was a Street Fighter 2 clone, but it used nothing but stick figures.

221
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,281
[SPEAKER_05]: But they actually stole voice samples out of the game in some of the later versions.

222
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:26,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

223
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:28,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.

224
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:29,542
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

225
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:34,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into tonight's housekeeping since we're done with our gaming weeks.

226
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:36,190
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into housekeeping tonight.

227
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:47,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the question on everybody's mind is, okay, we dropped that bombshell last week that Orange Lounge Radio is going to be closing its doors as a live 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week station as of April 12th.

228
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:49,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, April 3rd.

229
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, April 12th is our last broadcast today.

230
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:55,700
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

231
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:20,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to kind of thank everybody that sent us emails this week and sent us private messages and all of that sort and posts on forums and things with suggestions for us.

232
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:23,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I got told to check out about 10 different websites.

233
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:28,599
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple people actually offered to host a streaming thing for us.

234
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't able to do a lot of research on that, but I think that's very cool that people would do that.

235
00:17:35,327 --> 00:18:04,869
[SPEAKER_05]: but ultimately we decided to take things in a different direction and it was kind of the first thing that came it was the first idea that we had here at Orange Lounge Radio to do with the future of the show and um and first let me say this as well chat it's not April Fool's okay it just so happens live 365 you know if you've listened to the show long enough you know we freaking hate April Fool's Day okay so the last thing we would do is do something crappy like that for April Fool's Day this is not an April Fool's joke okay so um

236
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:06,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I lost my train of thought.

237
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:07,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn you, chat.

238
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:07,952
[SPEAKER_05]: What was I saying?

239
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:08,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

240
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:12,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first idea that came to our minds is the one we decided to go with.

241
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:20,219
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we emailed some people and did some talking and looks like everybody's on board.

242
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:22,160
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is what's going to happen, folks.

243
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:32,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting April 13th, that's episode number 275 of our show, we will now be officially a part of allgames.com.

244
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:40,685
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to merge, essentially, some of our shows from our station with the operations they have over at allgames.com.

245
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:53,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a way, I've been kind of joking all week long, it's creating a Voltron of independent podcasting, and that's kind of what I really believe in what's going to happen.

246
00:18:53,607 --> 00:19:01,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Because while we could have set up our own feed and taken one of these offers to set up our own thing and run our own music feed and live thing,

247
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:04,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Music and all that stuff takes a long time to set up.

248
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:08,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more than just putting MP3s at random, trust me for this.

249
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:14,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's kind of like...

250
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:26,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would we want to do that and run this whole separate thing when there's this perfectly established station going on over there that we already have a good relationship with because our show's been syndicated over on the network?

251
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,254
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the people there.

252
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:28,475
[SPEAKER_05]: We like the people over there.

253
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:31,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of something different-ish on the network.

254
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a type of show they don't have otherwise.

255
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Why go run off and do our own thing when we can instead come together and form...

256
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:42,042
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

257
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:12,165
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's the fact that you can listen to it on your PSP now.

258
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:19,790
[SPEAKER_05]: If you check out allgames.com on your PSP and I believe it's in the... It's one of the preset stations in the PSP as well.

259
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:24,013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a good thing.

260
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:27,395
[SPEAKER_05]: The more and more I kind of think about it, the more I think this is like the right idea for us.

261
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:33,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Here also, I have no announcements at this time as far as our other shows go.

262
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Travis Donovan and DMN.

263
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:37,502
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

264
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:43,399
[SPEAKER_05]: We are in talks to have that be a part of the merge, and they didn't say no.

265
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:45,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now that's all in limbo.

266
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:53,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nothing further to say at this time, but that is exciting that some of our other stuff will probably go over there as well if everybody's happy.

267
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:55,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put it that way.

268
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:57,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be good, though.

269
00:20:58,545 --> 00:20:59,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be a great thing.

270
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you guys want to add?

271
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:02,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I got nothing to add.

272
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:03,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing to add?

273
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:04,467
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

274
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:05,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I like pastrami.

275
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:06,228
[SPEAKER_05]: You like pastrami?

276
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:10,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

277
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:23,424
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we're not going to.

278
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we might do some aesthetic type changes with this move.

279
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:32,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we might take the opportunity to clean up our album art, maybe do a different audio.

280
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:34,891
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we might make some small aesthetical changes.

281
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:40,174
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as the content that you're actually going to hear in the show, nothing's going to change in that regard.

282
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:42,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Macquarie and Jamie, there will be more pastrami.

283
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:45,086
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

284
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:11,465
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, you're not going to have to change your subscription or anything like that.

285
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:12,606
[SPEAKER_05]: You're still going to get the podcast.

286
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:14,527
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like nothing ever happened for you guys.

287
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,449
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've never listened to us live, it's going to be like nothing ever happened.

288
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate to say it, even though the sound may be in higher quality, the show will not.

289
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:21,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the show will not be in higher quality.

290
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:22,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to say.

291
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:24,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So there it is.

292
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:26,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

293
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:27,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else to add?

294
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:28,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else we should say?

295
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:30,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

296
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm out of soda.

297
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:31,904
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not good.

298
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:52,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

299
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:05,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's about it

300
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:37,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I need it easier than that.

301
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:39,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Bookmark it.

302
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what else to tell you.

303
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:46,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Zlatan asks, will it be 30 seconds behind like Live 365?

304
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:56,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not think the buffer will be as great because I think we're having to say, because right now we send from my computer to Live 365 who encodes it to their server.

305
00:23:57,153 --> 00:23:59,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's going to be as much of a delay.

306
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:05,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there will still be a delay, but that's inevitable because of the encoding process, but it won't be like 30 seconds.

307
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:07,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be an hour.

308
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:10,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, BlackWolf, Bobby BlackWolf is in chat helping to clear the air right now.

309
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:10,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Bobby.

310
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:13,086
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually says it still will be 30 seconds.

311
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:16,929
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just inevitable, I mean, because it's buffer and all that stuff, so.

312
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Ross Steel, UT, says, fuck that, bring BlackWolf on and make fun of him.

313
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:22,813
[SPEAKER_05]: We just might do that, actually.

314
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:24,514
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we love Bobby, of course.

315
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:28,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby has actually been very instrumental in making this happen, so we love Bobby.

316
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:33,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that's another really good thing is because when we're live on Sunday nights...

317
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:39,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby's show airs at 5 o'clock and he says that he's going to keep his show to an hour.

318
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:43,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe occasionally he'll run over, but very little.

319
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:49,806
[SPEAKER_05]: But the nice thing is that instead of having music as a lead-in, we're going to have a really good quality show.

320
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:55,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like being on a real television network where you have a quality show as a lead-in to your show.

321
00:24:56,312 --> 00:24:56,953
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be great.

322
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:59,293
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think the listeners are really going to benefit.

323
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:03,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're all going to benefit because we'll get some of Bobby's people, he'll get some of our people.

324
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:05,897
[SPEAKER_05]: That all goes into the Voltron of independent podcasting.

325
00:25:06,217 --> 00:25:11,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when they have heroes on and then they have Chuck and then everyone turns the TV off when Chuck comes on.

326
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm hoping it doesn't go like that, but maybe.

327
00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:15,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

328
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:16,202
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

329
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:16,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it blend?

330
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:19,925
[SPEAKER_05]: It may indeed blend.

331
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:21,385
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

332
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:27,822
[SPEAKER_05]: WetWeToo in chat says, as usual, OLR is the gamer tech podcast.

333
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:29,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened to OLR Food Network?

334
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:31,247
[SPEAKER_05]: OLR Food Network is still here.

335
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:33,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Pastrami, Jamie?

336
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:34,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yum.

337
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:35,033
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

338
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,476
[SPEAKER_02]: With cheese and grilled onions.

339
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:37,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And no burger!

340
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:38,744
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

341
00:25:38,824 --> 00:25:39,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so mad.

342
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:07,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And they also have talk radio that plays throughout the day, which I think is highly entertaining.

343
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And you never know what might happen in the future.

344
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:10,462
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

345
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:18,667
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to free all of us up to kind of be working towards a more common goal now and working on, you know, kind of the visibility of the same radio station.

346
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:19,908
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a good thing.

347
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:20,929
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'll shut up.

348
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:21,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stop talking about it.

349
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,090
[SPEAKER_05]: We're beating this topic into the ground.

350
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:25,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki.

351
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:37,659
[SPEAKER_04]: A few tracks that will be available for, I guess, fans of Aerosmith.

352
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:47,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, included in these are Make It, Uncle Salty, Draw the Line, No Surprise, and Sweet Emotion.

353
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:50,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's kind of neat.

354
00:26:51,286 --> 00:26:54,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's going to be, I guess, 40 plus songs in the game.

355
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:59,911
[SPEAKER_04]: 60% of it, of course, I guess, will be devoted to Aerosmith.

356
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:01,572
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, actually, I saw like...

357
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:04,269
[SPEAKER_04]: The way they kind of have it set up is neat.

358
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,253
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be doing different sets, I guess, follow their career a little bit.

359
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:20,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll have two songs that are openers that are from a different band, and then they'll have three Aerosmith songs, maybe like a bonus song or something like that, and they're going to have different sets set up like that.

360
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:24,046
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as it's better than Guitar Hero Rocks the 80s, right?

361
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:26,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it will be, I mean...

362
00:27:27,452 --> 00:27:27,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve Tyler's Lips

363
00:27:46,722 --> 00:27:48,344
[SPEAKER_05]: and those big ol' lips are on the cover.

364
00:27:48,764 --> 00:27:51,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that going to be enough, do you think, to sell this game?

365
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, but here's the thing.

366
00:27:54,031 --> 00:28:01,160
[SPEAKER_04]: The easiest way to decide if you want this game or not is to wait until they get down to the point where they announce the entire soundtrack to the game.

367
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just, okay, is that something that you want or not?

368
00:28:05,913 --> 00:28:08,394
[SPEAKER_04]: My guess is they're not going to have download content for this game.

369
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:12,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably just going to be, you know, these songs and that's it.

370
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:15,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, why would they cut into their Guitar Hero 3 download content?

371
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:18,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, of course, is still going to be going on until Guitar Hero 4 comes out.

372
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

373
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:42,595
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these music games are really starting to milk it to the point of getting sick of this.

374
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:53,398
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we'll be getting to some other stuff later like SingStar, which... I'm thinking part of the reason that makes this so alluring is that it looks like they're just using the same damn engine from Guitar Hero 3.

375
00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:55,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It's updated a little bit.

376
00:28:55,238 --> 00:28:57,198
[SPEAKER_04]: The engine itself is actually upgraded a bit.

377
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:58,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Define a little bit.

378
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:02,539
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics are a little bit better, animations are recaptured and they're a lot smoother.

379
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff like that, but...

380
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's basically Guitar Hero 3.

381
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:12,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Gerardimo in chat, chat.orange.com, suggests Guitar Hero ABBA mix.

382
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:14,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be down with that.

383
00:29:14,812 --> 00:29:16,452
[SPEAKER_02]: But do they use any real guitar?

384
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:21,673
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but you know, they have an opening for a drummer, so there might be Drum Hero.

385
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,613
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I had to laugh, though.

386
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:23,573
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to love this.

387
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:33,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to laugh because on the trailer, you know how they have all the little logos of the different people that have products in the game and stuff like that, and Gibson was on there?

388
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:35,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, that's funny.

389
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:36,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the irony.

390
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:37,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Ironic.

391
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:39,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Very ironic.

392
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:41,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Ray Yane.

393
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:49,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll hear more about Guitar Hero Aerosmith in the future, I'm sure, as we get closer to the release date.

394
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:55,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Another game we're hearing more and more about is Ninja Gaiden 2, which looks bloody fantastic.

395
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:57,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Emphasis on bloody.

396
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:58,627
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks wonderful.

397
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:03,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninja Gaiden 2, if you want to see all that blood, the demo is going to be coming in May.

398
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:08,550
[SPEAKER_05]: May is going to be the delivery of the Ninja Gaiden 2 demo.

399
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,271
[SPEAKER_05]: That is according to Microsoft's Ninja Gaiden 2 website.

400
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:18,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently there's also supposed to be some exclusive content beginning on April 15th.

401
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:26,134
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's anything like previous exclusive content, it's probably crappy gamer picks and crappy themes and maybe some cool looking trailers.

402
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:27,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninja Gaiden Hi-Rez

403
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:52,700
[SPEAKER_05]: PENNY ARCADE ADVENTURES ON THE RAINSLICK PRECIPICE OF DARKNESS

404
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:27,624
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a price out for it now, $19.95, which would be about half that numeric value in pounds for our UK listeners.

405
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:31,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just for the Windows, Mac, and Linux version of the game.

406
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:33,966
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be released on Linux, that's cool.

407
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:41,068
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an Xbox Live Arcade version that will have a simultaneous launch, no price released yet.

408
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:45,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Five to ten hours of playing for you, so that's pretty cool.

409
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:48,106
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's weird.

410
00:31:48,166 --> 00:32:03,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that they were saying that the Xbox Live Arcade version was going to be $20, which I thought was kind of surprising, seeing as they haven't really had a game that was spent $20.

411
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:10,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think most was like Luminous with $15 and stuff, but $20 for that game is really expensive.

412
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:11,882
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little steep.

413
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:15,304
[SPEAKER_05]: This game better be epic as well.

414
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:16,347
[SPEAKER_05]: For $20.

415
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:18,530
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to pay that much money, I'll just get it on Windows.

416
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,234
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, I was going to say, you know, $20 is kind of the average.

417
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:26,317
[SPEAKER_05]: $19.95 is what you pay for a low-budget Windows game.

418
00:32:26,357 --> 00:32:28,780
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it really that obscene of a price on Xbox Live?

419
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

420
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:32,423
[SPEAKER_05]: But as long as the game is quality, that's what's important.

421
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:35,366
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it has a great tie-in, you know,

422
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:40,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know a lot of gamers who don't love Penny Arcade, or at least like and respect it a lot.

423
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:47,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know it's going to be at least the quality there, it's just the question of, but will it be, it's kind of like that question, will it blend?

424
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it blend into a game?

425
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:50,761
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

426
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:53,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

427
00:32:53,703 --> 00:33:02,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Now a game that we're probably not going to get over here, unfortunately, Raiden Fighters Aces has gotten a demo on the Japanese Xbox Live.

428
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:03,526
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX Live Accounts

429
00:33:34,232 --> 00:33:45,421
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was, back in the day on the PlayStation, there was just, for the first two write-in games, before these came out, there was a compilation on there.

430
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:48,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see one that's all of them.

431
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:51,566
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a big compilation.

432
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:53,247
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a very big compilation.

433
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:54,188
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be epic.

434
00:33:54,585 --> 00:33:55,886
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what that compilation's called?

435
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:56,386
[SPEAKER_04]: MAME.

436
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:05,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the boards for the first three Raiden games have been intensely difficult for them to crack.

437
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:11,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they've only gotten... They haven't... As far as I know, they haven't cracked Raiden DX yet.

438
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:12,835
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was fun.

439
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:13,936
[SPEAKER_04]: We had that at our roundtable.

440
00:34:14,296 --> 00:34:19,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I like the electric one that latches on and does the swirly bit.

441
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:19,959
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my favorite one.

442
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:20,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

443
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,381
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need them all.

444
00:34:24,611 --> 00:34:36,478
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, talking about, you know, games coming from Japan and shooter games, you know, I guess somebody out there was just thinking to themselves, like, you know, we don't have enough shoot-em-up games on Xbox Live.

445
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:37,159
[SPEAKER_05]: We really don't.

446
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:37,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more.

447
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And luckily, though, one of the granddaddies of shoot-em-up games is on its way to Xbox Live Arcade.

448
00:34:44,523 --> 00:34:45,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Ikaruga.

449
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we can make room for that.

450
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,606
[SPEAKER_05]: We can find room in there somewhere.

451
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:53,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, we've been having rumors about this game for a couple weeks now.

452
00:34:53,749 --> 00:34:58,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And the latest one, I think last week we had the month nailed down as April.

453
00:34:58,132 --> 00:35:06,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this week, thanks to Japan's version of Xbox.com, we now know that the release date is set to be April 9th.

454
00:35:07,718 --> 00:35:13,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, of course, all these types of things are always subject to change, and who knows, the Japanese website could have been wrong, but...

455
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:20,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It does look pretty likely it's going to be out in early April rather than later, which isn't a bad thing because Ikaruga is pretty awesome.

456
00:35:20,603 --> 00:35:21,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty awesome.

457
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:25,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we can make room for one more shooter if it's Ikaruga.

458
00:35:25,184 --> 00:35:28,225
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I would rather see than Ikaruga?

459
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:28,505
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

460
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:29,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Radiant Silvergun.

461
00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:31,266
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

462
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:32,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish.

463
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:37,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in other...

464
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:48,107
[SPEAKER_02]: News as far as games to be out, and this is actually more of a leak from the ESRB, and this would be also for Xbox Live.

465
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:54,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Darwinia is supposed to be coming out, and it actually was confirmed.

466
00:35:55,311 --> 00:36:07,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually listed as Darwinia Plus, Survival of the Flat, which is, okay, from what I'm understanding on here, it's a multiplayer version, Multiwinia, Survival of the Flattest.

467
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:13,131
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fairly interesting, and we've had a lot of people tell us about this game, that it's supposed to be really good.

468
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:17,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's actually a demo out for Windows, Mac, and Linux right now.

469
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:24,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Quiltipo in chat says, Screw Darwinia, I want Darwin Awards the game.

470
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:28,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that just pain on PlayStation Network?

471
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:28,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

472
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:30,648
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds sort of like it.

473
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:34,044
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, Darwinia, I've heard nothing but good things about Darwinia.

474
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:39,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of neat that these little games are getting this more massive distribution.

475
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:48,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm assuming from the whole plus in the name, there's going to be a lot of extra features, which probably will, you know, be justifying the cost of it on Xbox Live.

476
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:50,707
[SPEAKER_05]: But I look forward to an easy way to check it out.

477
00:36:51,027 --> 00:36:57,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if anyone wants to check out the demo, go to introversion.co.uk slash Darwinia.

478
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can download the demo there.

479
00:37:01,297 --> 00:37:03,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a headache.

480
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:36,847
[SPEAKER_04]: No interest from me whatsoever, but hey, I know a lot of people liked it.

481
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:41,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it once, and I know it has a rabid fan base because of its quirky sense of humor.

482
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

483
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:47,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you're looking forward to it, I would say probably going to see it in November.

484
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:51,638
[SPEAKER_05]: How highly anticipated do you think this game is?

485
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:55,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, one thing I also know about Banjo-Kazooie is it's been a long time since there's been a game in this series.

486
00:37:55,721 --> 00:38:00,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they teased it at E3 last year, but that's probably the last we've heard of it.

487
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:01,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

488
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:03,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

489
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:03,869
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be neat.

490
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:09,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they need some good family games, I guess, because Viva Pinata's not that great.

491
00:38:10,393 --> 00:38:11,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no offense.

492
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:11,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

493
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:13,515
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people that love Viva Pinata.

494
00:38:13,555 --> 00:38:18,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the wrong people that Microsoft thought were going to get into Viva Pinata got into Viva Pinata.

495
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:19,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

496
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:24,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they should take a note from it that they need a good sim game on the Xbox 360, okay?

497
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:29,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, what they should do, though, Viva Pinata, though, it's...

498
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:33,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold Banjo in chat says Banjo Kazooie is awesome, that's what my screen name is named after

499
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:00,292
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

500
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:20,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the deal.

501
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:26,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft has been going through and finding people who have been cheating in games.

502
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:28,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing save game hacks.

503
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:30,796
[SPEAKER_05]: How do people cheat their gamerscore?

504
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:31,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you ought to know this stuff.

505
00:39:32,057 --> 00:39:33,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would I know this stuff?

506
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:34,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I know you would know this stuff.

507
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:44,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there's some workarounds that they can actually do where it hacks their actual profile that you don't even need to play the game to get the achievement points from.

508
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:45,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

509
00:39:45,974 --> 00:39:48,356
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they're really cracking down on, is stuff like that.

510
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:49,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

511
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:53,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can't do the save stuff anymore.

512
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:58,784
[SPEAKER_04]: They have that stupid digital rights management thing that they threw in there to fuck everybody over with everything.

513
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:03,988
[SPEAKER_04]: That stopped people from save swapping and stuff like that.

514
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:10,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And not all the games worked with save swapping, so it was very unreliable stuff.

515
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,001
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

516
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:35,782
[SPEAKER_05]: So now these folks basically get the scarlet question mark, or it's more the orange question mark on their profile that labels them as a cheater.

517
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:49,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait because, you know, I'm not too optimistic on Microsoft in picking people that cheat, and I have a feeling they're going to make some mistakes in there, and they're going to pick people that, like, did not cheat, and they're going to mark them as cheaters, and that's going to have a whole backlash thing.

518
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:52,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would just ban these people from Xbox Live.

519
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:53,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't they just doing that?

520
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:55,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they seem to do that with everything else.

521
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:58,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why they just have to... Making examples of them.

522
00:40:58,675 --> 00:40:59,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's fine.

523
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:06,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem with them making examples out of them, but I have a feeling that they're going to get some people that really didn't cheat.

524
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Why's it got to be an orange question mark?

525
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:09,681
[SPEAKER_05]: What's wrong with orange?

526
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:11,742
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a problem with orange, Microsoft?

527
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:12,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Why's it got to be an orange question mark?

528
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:13,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Jerks?

529
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:15,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's kind of a gold orange.

530
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:16,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

531
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:25,016
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think at the same time Microsoft is like running rampant accusing everybody of being a witch, you know?

532
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:25,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Witch!

533
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:27,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheetah!

534
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:29,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Burn the cheetah!

535
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:31,618
[SPEAKER_05]: We found a witch, may we burn her?

536
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:35,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Microsoft is running through the village accusing everybody of being a witch.

537
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:39,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they just targeted some of the high profile people like

538
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Strip Club, GJ, you know that guy.

539
00:41:43,242 --> 00:41:57,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know him because he actually messaged me once because I got DDR Universe the day it came out and I was playing it like all day long and I had like 500 gamerscore and I must have had one of the higher gamerscores out of anybody that day because he messaged me and he was like, how was the game?

540
00:41:57,824 --> 00:41:58,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it good?

541
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it easy to get the gamerscore?

542
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:08,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So I remember him because I laughed my ass off when I saw I was getting this message from him and I heard he was one of the people that got caught with this and sure enough, yes he is.

543
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost have 10,000 gamer points.

544
00:42:10,082 --> 00:42:12,044
[SPEAKER_05]: No thanks to my friend playing Rock Band for me.

545
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:27,238
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not cheating in the sense of Microsoft cheating.

546
00:42:27,638 --> 00:42:29,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Sire Ran says, how do you know it's a cheater?

547
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like one!

548
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,441
[SPEAKER_03]: They turned me into a Yaris.

549
00:42:32,822 --> 00:42:36,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Turned me into a... I got better.

550
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:39,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Strip Club DJ made me play Yaris.

551
00:42:41,248 --> 00:42:42,428
[SPEAKER_06]: That's punishable by death.

552
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Burn him!

553
00:42:45,455 --> 00:42:46,496
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you know they're a cheater?

554
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:47,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Build a game out of them!

555
00:43:13,032 --> 00:43:14,333
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

556
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know, which is a very broad term.

557
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:45,362
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what we're parrying here, Jamie.

558
00:43:45,382 --> 00:43:54,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, a, uh, a Goomba hunt.

559
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,491
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be a release dates.

560
00:43:58,312 --> 00:43:59,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, how about that?

561
00:44:00,193 --> 00:44:02,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some release dates right here, okay?

562
00:44:02,595 --> 00:44:02,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

563
00:44:03,716 --> 00:44:04,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have four.

564
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:07,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And two of them are the same game.

565
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:08,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what's that?

566
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

567
00:44:10,621 --> 00:44:16,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Baroque on the first for PS2 and Wii and Kingdom 2 Bloodshot on Xbox 360 and PS3.

568
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:18,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

569
00:44:18,944 --> 00:44:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Now how can she predict the future about all these games coming out in the UK?

570
00:44:22,765 --> 00:44:23,665
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because she's a witch!

571
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:24,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Witch!

572
00:44:25,385 --> 00:44:27,626
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's because I have reliable sources.

573
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:29,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

574
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:30,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Reliable witch sources!

575
00:44:31,758 --> 00:44:37,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked into my cauldron and lit some charcoal and read it in the smoke.

576
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:41,845
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I want the Witch Hunt joke to die now before it gets too old.

577
00:44:41,985 --> 00:44:43,186
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a wiki on it now.

578
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:47,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the OLR wiki more than anything.

579
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:48,449
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so great.

580
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:49,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, as is it.

581
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,032
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, what's going on in the U.S.?

582
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:56,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot of good stuff, unfortunately.

583
00:44:57,415 --> 00:45:01,118
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this time around we get some crap, including...

584
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:08,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Rafa Nadal, Tennis on the DS I think that came out already, but eh, whatever.

585
00:45:09,365 --> 00:45:12,308
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably a GameStop exclusive, but that's okay, it sucks.

586
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:16,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Octomania got delayed, I guess, a week or so.

587
00:45:17,392 --> 00:45:22,816
[SPEAKER_04]: That's now coming out on the Wii, $19.99 for Puzzle Game, and it has online, so that's not bad.

588
00:45:23,237 --> 00:45:24,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's Atlus, you gotta support Atlus.

589
00:45:25,899 --> 00:45:28,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And, let's see, Monochemia, uh,

590
00:45:29,147 --> 00:45:34,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Alchemist of Al Rivas, and that's a new Koei RPG for the PlayStation 2.

591
00:45:36,272 --> 00:45:39,814
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a game called Toy Shop, which is coming out on the DS.

592
00:45:39,994 --> 00:45:42,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's like a sim Toy Shop game.

593
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see here, Call of Duty 4, Game of the Year Edition.

594
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:49,420
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming out on the 1st as well.

595
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,784
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a re-release of Call of Duty 4 with the downloadable map pack, or token for that.

596
00:45:56,445 --> 00:45:58,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't have it yet, that's probably the way you want to go.

597
00:46:00,435 --> 00:46:02,637
[SPEAKER_04]: and let's see here.

598
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:07,919
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also World Championship cards on the PSP.

599
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,322
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's pretty much it.

600
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Eye of Judgment, Nintendo Wii,

601
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:38,086
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very slow week in Japan as far as the next-gen systems go.

602
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:48,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, on the PlayStation 2, you get Pro Yaku Spirits 5 comes out, which is another baseball simulator game.

603
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that, I suppose, to look forward to.

604
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:53,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see if there's anything on the handhelds.

605
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:55,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Surely there's got to be something on the Nintendo DS.

606
00:46:56,254 --> 00:46:57,194
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's really not.

607
00:46:57,955 --> 00:46:59,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, on April 3rd, there is some stuff coming out.

608
00:47:04,107 --> 00:47:10,371
[SPEAKER_05]: One High Ten Fun by Igaizu Zunikakuru DS Detective Conan

609
00:47:15,988 --> 00:47:17,149
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new game coming out there.

610
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:21,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And this game coming from a group called FonFon is the publisher for this one.

611
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:27,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Kuchan no Shiwase Kantan Oryuri Recipe comes out.

612
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:31,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like a cooking game or it could be, I don't think it's cooking.

613
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:33,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is actually like a virtual cookbook.

614
00:47:34,183 --> 00:47:36,685
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it has like 300 recipes in a little virtual cookbook.

615
00:47:36,705 --> 00:47:39,807
[SPEAKER_05]: They were supposed to release something like that out here, but they never did.

616
00:47:40,268 --> 00:47:44,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can import this one, except I hope you can read Japanese or it's really not going to do you a lot of good.

617
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:46,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you probably aren't going to be able to do it.

618
00:47:47,934 --> 00:47:49,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything on the PSP?

619
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:54,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Star Ocean Second Evolution comes out on the Sony PSP from Squeenix.

620
00:47:54,636 --> 00:47:55,216
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.

621
00:47:55,316 --> 00:47:57,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so that would probably be one of the bigger releases in Japan this week.

622
00:47:58,017 --> 00:47:59,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, you've got to really wait until next week.

623
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:02,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of big releases in Japan this week.

624
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:08,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's a slow week all around, but probably because we're kind of in a little bit of a slow period until we get into, like, the summer games.

625
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:11,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll see a lot of stuff.

626
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:12,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

627
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:25,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of curiosity, real quick, before we get into the next story, because Summer Games reminded me, there's the Olympics this year, yet outside of Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, I haven't heard of a lot of, like, Beijing video games.

628
00:48:25,814 --> 00:48:26,494
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with that?

629
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:28,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it seems like every year there's an Olympics.

630
00:48:28,494 --> 00:48:29,174
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some horrible games.

631
00:48:29,194 --> 00:48:31,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega is putting out an Olympics game in June.

632
00:48:31,615 --> 00:48:32,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

633
00:48:33,015 --> 00:48:33,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Beijing Olympics.

634
00:48:34,296 --> 00:48:34,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait.

635
00:48:35,836 --> 00:48:36,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

636
00:48:37,016 --> 00:48:37,816
[SPEAKER_04]: There is one coming.

637
00:48:38,176 --> 00:48:38,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it coming on the Wii?

638
00:48:39,397 --> 00:48:40,497
[SPEAKER_04]: PS3 and Xbox 360.

639
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,591
[SPEAKER_05]: No Wii.

640
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, maybe they don't want it to interview with Mario and Sonic at the Olympics one.

641
00:48:46,953 --> 00:48:47,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

642
00:48:47,673 --> 00:48:50,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that, but there is one coming.

643
00:48:51,756 --> 00:48:52,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

644
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:54,837
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you giggling about over there, dare I ask?

645
00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:02,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the listener profiles on our wiki, and while Steel U teases, great.

646
00:49:03,962 --> 00:49:04,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor guy.

647
00:49:04,823 --> 00:49:05,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I'm sorry.

648
00:49:05,763 --> 00:49:06,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop picking on him.

649
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:08,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to pick on him, but I just...

650
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Did not expect it.

651
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:13,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, okay.

652
00:49:14,623 --> 00:49:16,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Gerardimo said, Sky, why is that bad?

653
00:49:17,025 --> 00:49:17,966
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily bad.

654
00:49:18,006 --> 00:49:20,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious.

655
00:49:20,348 --> 00:49:23,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually these Olympic games are fucking horrible anyway.

656
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:29,896
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just curious because I was surprised I haven't heard a lot about tie-in games when the Beijing Olympics are kind of a big deal.

657
00:49:30,236 --> 00:49:31,577
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to hear something weird?

658
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:32,117
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

659
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:33,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally off topic here, but...

660
00:49:34,614 --> 00:49:40,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, there's a game, or not next week, but the week after next, there's a game on the DS coming out called Plushies.

661
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:41,936
[SPEAKER_04]: That reminds me of, like, furries.

662
00:49:42,797 --> 00:49:43,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

663
00:49:44,477 --> 00:49:45,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my ferret, Rob.

664
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:46,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the jokes begin.

665
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my ferret.

666
00:49:48,898 --> 00:49:49,619
[SPEAKER_05]: You want the ferret?

667
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:50,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

668
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:52,219
[SPEAKER_05]: We might be able to make that happen.

669
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,080
[SPEAKER_05]: But not unless you read us more news.

670
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some news.

671
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:00,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony has said they're sorry.

672
00:50:00,742 --> 00:50:03,423
[SPEAKER_02]: We already knew they were sorry, but they've also apologized, too.

673
00:50:05,732 --> 00:50:28,996
[SPEAKER_02]: they now have some updates to the PS3 store and one of them is Gran Turismo 5 Prologue which for the UK is $24.99 with UEFA Euro 2008 demo and Unreal Tournament 3 for free and Turok Map Packs for $1.99 and the Eye of Judgment Bio Rebellion card set for $6.99 also PS1 Realfishing

674
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,271
[SPEAKER_02]: has been added for $3.49 to PS3 and PSP stores.

675
00:50:36,331 --> 00:50:44,295
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also trailers on the PS3 store for Everybody's Golf World Tour, Eye of Judgment...

676
00:51:01,147 --> 00:51:04,169
[SPEAKER_02]: GT5 Prologue, Dark Sector, and Dynasty Warriors 6.

677
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:12,053
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sony said, we sorry, poo, poo on us.

678
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:16,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow I don't think they phrased it quite like that.

679
00:51:16,591 --> 00:51:24,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to quote, as previously mentioned, we unfortunately experienced some last-minute technical difficulties and weren't able to publish the new content as planned.

680
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:33,041
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we have been working hard to resolve these issues and are pleased to be able to let you know that basically they're all live on the UK store.

681
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:35,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is specific, by the way, to the UK store.

682
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:42,767
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Pal is out, so if you want to play an extended demo, go for it.

683
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:50,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, also in the U.S., they made some announcements of upcoming stuff, not necessarily anything coming out right away.

684
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:58,422
[SPEAKER_04]: But late April, we're going to be getting the Pixel Junk Monsters Encore, which is an expansion pack to, of course, Pixel Junk Monsters.

685
00:51:59,403 --> 00:52:05,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Early May, we'll be getting Echo Chrome, and in May sometime, Elefunc.

686
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:34,906
[SPEAKER_04]: and then late May or early June Wipeout HD so that's pretty cool they had some pretty interesting videos for Wipeout some Omega Pack or something that got released had some really trippy kind of like cartoony tracks I don't know so definitely check those out if you own Wipeout Pulse on the PSP it should be on the Playstation Store you can download those okay some other fun stuff

687
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:37,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, guess what?

688
00:52:37,593 --> 00:52:41,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby said he didn't need to make one creative change to our show, and that is that no more ferret.

689
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:44,275
Ferret, no.

690
00:52:45,155 --> 00:52:46,616
[SPEAKER_05]: The batteries are going to die in that thing.

691
00:52:46,816 --> 00:52:49,457
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that we've had that thing for as long as we've been doing this show?

692
00:52:49,577 --> 00:52:50,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mascot.

693
00:52:50,077 --> 00:52:51,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Those batteries are going to die someday.

694
00:52:52,198 --> 00:52:53,638
[SPEAKER_02]: The ferret is eternal.

695
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:54,278
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they won't.

696
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,499
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't understand, Rob.

697
00:52:56,819 --> 00:52:59,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You can rip them open and put new batteries in.

698
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,220
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I got those other ones to work.

699
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you have to fucking tell her how to do it?

700
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how to do it.

701
00:53:04,372 --> 00:53:07,594
[SPEAKER_05]: You could smile and nod and say, yes, Rob, the ferret will die.

702
00:53:08,294 --> 00:53:11,216
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, you have to say, oh, we can give it a lobotomy.

703
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:15,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, there's almost a bald spot now from where I've been pressing it in the same spot.

704
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,501
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ferret abuse.

705
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:20,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, are we a video game podcast?

706
00:53:20,982 --> 00:53:22,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I was getting confused.

707
00:53:22,063 --> 00:53:23,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was going to get into a story.

708
00:53:23,684 --> 00:53:24,985
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the food and ferret cast.

709
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:30,889
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you had to mention Bobby and it halted the show.

710
00:53:31,756 --> 00:53:34,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so Grand Theft Auto 4.

711
00:53:35,117 --> 00:53:38,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they like to innovate with each new release that they're coming out.

712
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:40,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is something very interesting.

713
00:53:40,578 --> 00:53:45,419
[SPEAKER_04]: What they're actually going to incorporate into Grand Theft Auto 4 is real-world music downloads.

714
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be tied in with Amazon.com.

715
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:54,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the way this works is in the game, you can actually call an in-game service called Zit on your mobile phone.

716
00:53:55,602 --> 00:53:59,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get text messages with song and artist names.

717
00:53:59,693 --> 00:54:25,406
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as an email if you're a member of the Rockstar Social Club and then when you download tracks or whatever they're going to be about 89 cents to 99 cents and they'll actually of course they're DRM free because they're MP3s but I guess you can download them in game and you'll also get them in the real world so that's pretty cool that you'll be able to download some music

718
00:54:28,922 --> 00:54:33,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody by the nickname of Beatmania Slot Machine in our chatroom says, Orange Ferret Foodio.

719
00:54:34,923 --> 00:54:37,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I misunderstood this a little bit.

720
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:45,645
[SPEAKER_04]: The way this works is the soundtrack for the game, so the music actually inside the game, not additional music.

721
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:52,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you hear a song you like on the radio or something like that, you can dial that service in the game and then get the MP3 sent to you.

722
00:54:53,406 --> 00:54:55,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have to make a comment to Beatmania Slot Machine.

723
00:54:55,747 --> 00:54:56,067
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

724
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:58,287
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually not a slot machine, it's Apache Slot

725
00:54:59,249 --> 00:55:00,170
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll get to that later.

726
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't spoil the upcoming news stories.

727
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:03,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't spoil them.

728
00:55:03,752 --> 00:55:04,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

729
00:55:05,193 --> 00:55:14,680
[SPEAKER_04]: But I assume since this is an Xbox 360 game and a PS3 game that you'll be able to put your own music in there anyway, so that'd be cool.

730
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't they doing this in real cars, too?

731
00:55:17,322 --> 00:55:19,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least I know there's that whole cell phone thing.

732
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:27,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't there a commercial on TV for Verizon or something where you hold up your cell phone and it will recognize the song and download it for you or something like that?

733
00:55:27,249 --> 00:55:29,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's stuff like that out there.

734
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:29,450
[SPEAKER_05]: www.DarkSakura.com

735
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:56,180
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not physically taking the money out of your wallet and handing it to somebody or your purse or whatever.

736
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,540
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not handing it to somebody.

737
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, it's so much easier to make these stupid impulse buys.

738
00:56:02,243 --> 00:56:09,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this whole feature, while it's interesting and kind of cool, I guess, for a video game, is kind of capitalizing on that.

739
00:56:09,926 --> 00:56:15,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know there are going to be a lot of people that buy this game, and there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be like, Ooh, I like this game.

740
00:56:16,029 --> 00:56:16,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Click!

741
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:17,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I just spent a dollar.

742
00:56:18,092 --> 00:56:19,213
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just a dollar.

743
00:56:19,393 --> 00:56:20,454
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I hate about iTunes.

744
00:56:20,494 --> 00:56:21,734
[SPEAKER_05]: But I click 20 times.

745
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, iTunes is almost the same type of thing.

746
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,017
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was saying.

747
00:56:26,297 --> 00:56:27,178
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I hate about iTunes.

748
00:56:27,478 --> 00:56:28,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially since it's on my damn phone!

749
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:33,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gone how many years without buying a damn thing on iTunes until I got my phone?

750
00:56:51,195 --> 00:56:53,296
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I probably... I'm still okay.

751
00:56:53,336 --> 00:56:55,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I've probably only bought like 25 songs total.

752
00:56:55,718 --> 00:56:56,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that convenience.

753
00:56:56,879 --> 00:56:57,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you.

754
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:58,800
[SPEAKER_05]: We're such a lazy society.

755
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:05,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not necessarily a... Like, I'm not saying like, oh, you're bad or, you know, oh, you're... But it's just kind of where we are.

756
00:57:05,144 --> 00:57:12,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more putting the temptation in there because honestly, and this is how me personally I am, I believe that the things worth having are worth working for.

757
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:13,509
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

758
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,059
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I'm putting a giant cookie.

759
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,320
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I got it.

760
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:20,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm putting a giant piece of pastrami in your hands.

761
00:57:20,264 --> 00:57:22,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that big on pastrami.

762
00:57:23,862 --> 00:57:27,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted pastrami today, so I got pastrami.

763
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:28,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fine.

764
00:57:28,265 --> 00:57:29,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Press button, get pastrami.

765
00:57:29,526 --> 00:57:29,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

766
00:57:29,886 --> 00:57:32,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I put a big bottle of Goldschlager in your hand.

767
00:57:32,267 --> 00:57:32,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Goldschlager.

768
00:57:32,928 --> 00:57:34,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, well, goddammit, what is something you like?

769
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:35,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I want.

770
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I like sushi.

771
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:38,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sushi.

772
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:42,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I put a big piece of sushi in your hand, and I say, hold on to this for a little bit.

773
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:47,336
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, if you eat that, you can eat it, but it will cost you a couple bucks.

774
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:48,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to go, gulp.

775
00:57:48,837 --> 00:57:50,118
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, oh, it's just a couple bucks.

776
00:57:50,178 --> 00:57:50,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Gulp.

777
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, here, hold this piece too.

778
00:57:53,941 --> 00:57:56,823
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like hotel rooms at, you know, more upscale.

779
00:57:56,843 --> 00:57:57,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously they don't have it at Motel 6.

780
00:57:58,724 --> 00:58:04,768
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, you know, the more upscale type motels, they'll have all the candy and shit sitting out right there on the table.

781
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:07,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, you know, hey, if you open it, two bucks.

782
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:11,152
[SPEAKER_05]: What a terrible thing if you brought kids on the trip.

783
00:58:11,212 --> 00:58:12,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know what I do?

784
00:58:12,673 --> 00:58:14,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to a grocery store down the street and buy me a bottle.

785
00:58:14,894 --> 00:58:15,755
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you gotta do.

786
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:17,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sorry, tangent.

787
00:58:18,437 --> 00:58:19,557
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we without our tangents?

788
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:20,498
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

789
00:58:22,216 --> 00:58:28,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say I want a service on Xbox Live where I can pay for a pizza with Microsoft Points.

790
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:29,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Slash pizza?

791
00:58:30,722 --> 00:58:32,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

792
00:58:32,623 --> 00:58:34,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Why shouldn't I be able to get... Wait!

793
00:58:34,725 --> 00:58:37,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet that type of stuff is only a matter of time away.

794
00:58:38,287 --> 00:58:38,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Only a matter of time.

795
00:58:39,028 --> 00:58:43,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to stop, pause my game for a second, order a pizza.

796
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:47,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I could just call up a pizza place and play the game at the same time.

797
00:58:47,994 --> 00:58:49,675
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about integration, so why not?

798
00:58:50,956 --> 00:58:54,697
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you get sick of pizza, I mean, I worked at a pizza place.

799
00:58:54,737 --> 00:58:55,718
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't get sick of pizza.

800
00:58:55,738 --> 00:58:57,278
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I love internet TV.

801
00:58:58,099 --> 00:59:03,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because me and every, I've made it perfectly clear, I hate being a slave to my television.

802
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:11,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate having to, and you know, I don't see any money of paying for a DVR when I can just go online and watch whatever.

803
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:12,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to hear something that's going to be really bad?

804
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:19,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait till Spore comes out and they have that service where you can create your character and then get a figurine of it.

805
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:21,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that looks awesome!

806
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Figuring, figuring, figuring!

807
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:27,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And they deliver this giant crate of figures for your house.

808
00:59:27,923 --> 00:59:29,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, I actually would do that.

809
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:34,006
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I also go back and have drawn fan art of my PSO character in the past.

810
00:59:34,627 --> 00:59:37,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do it too, and I like crappy things made by me, that's why.

811
00:59:40,029 --> 00:59:43,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody, pay me 20 bucks and I'll draw your RPG character.

812
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:45,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have another thought you were trying to finish, Jamie?

813
00:59:45,052 --> 00:59:45,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

814
00:59:49,664 --> 00:59:55,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this comment from RossDLUT in regards to the pizza being sold on Xbox Live Marketplace.

815
00:59:56,026 --> 01:00:00,627
[SPEAKER_05]: But then the pizza would be DRM protected and you'd not be able to eat it if something went wrong before it got delivered.

816
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:01,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember what I was saying.

817
01:00:03,508 --> 01:00:09,190
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was saying is that as long as you have a computer near you, anything is convenient.

818
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:14,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like I was saying, I don't watch TV, but I'll watch whatever I can on the internet and do all of my other stuff.

819
01:00:14,707 --> 01:00:14,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Better.

820
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Go out and get it.

821
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:48,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Better yet, you order like Pizza Hut or something like that because, you know, they're kind of affiliated with, I know, I know, I'd prefer Roundtable, but that's regional and, you know, Pizza Hut, they did the whole affiliation with, you know, Xbox and stuff like that.

822
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:55,469
[SPEAKER_04]: So you order like a Pizza Hut pizza and they have a card from Microsoft Points taped to the top of the box.

823
01:00:55,869 --> 01:00:58,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'd be cool, like, you know, 500 points or something like that.

824
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:01,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Pizza Hut Outfit Pizza in Game

825
01:01:20,506 --> 01:01:21,246
[SPEAKER_04]: That's integration.

826
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:24,508
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to hire us as marketing consultants.

827
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:27,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to bring a soundboard with us to all games.

828
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:27,969
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

829
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:30,790
[SPEAKER_05]: You think Bobby would love that, if we take a soundboard with us to all games?

830
01:01:30,871 --> 01:01:31,791
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fantastic.

831
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:34,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, Gerardimo, Papa John's got me through college.

832
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:37,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need an actual soundboard first.

833
01:01:38,134 --> 01:01:38,754
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll work on it.

834
01:01:42,406 --> 01:01:47,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to go crazy with it, because I don't want to go crazy with a soundboard, but sometimes it's just too good.

835
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:49,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, sorry, back to video gaming news.

836
01:01:50,634 --> 01:01:56,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, I wouldn't say this is gaming news, Morris, it is gaming rumor, that is big, big rumor.

837
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the achievements for Grand Theft Auto 4 have hit the internet.

838
01:02:01,423 --> 01:02:06,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Two different websites have posted the 50 different achievements that are supposed to be in the game.

839
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:16,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the achievements are supposed to include things like hidden packages, doing types of stunt jumping, completing certain mission, beating minigames.

840
01:02:16,937 --> 01:02:18,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the other features, though, are a little weird.

841
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:21,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some sample achievements.

842
01:02:22,682 --> 01:02:24,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Manhunt will get you 15 gamerscore.

843
01:02:25,064 --> 01:02:28,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Complete the most wanted side missions from the police computer.

844
01:02:29,808 --> 01:02:30,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Warm coffee.

845
01:02:31,229 --> 01:02:33,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Successfully date a girl to be invited into her house.

846
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:38,330
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's true, that's a pretty bold achievement.

847
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:39,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Warm coffee.

848
01:02:41,893 --> 01:02:43,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Let sleeping rock stars lie.

849
01:02:44,415 --> 01:02:45,436
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 gamers score.

850
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:48,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill a rock star developer in a ranked multiplayer match.

851
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:50,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see that.

852
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,641
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a couple games that have things like that.

853
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:54,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill the creator or something like that.

854
01:02:54,763 --> 01:02:55,924
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be sweet.

855
01:02:56,224 --> 01:02:56,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

856
01:02:56,604 --> 01:02:58,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they kind of sound legitimate.

857
01:02:58,686 --> 01:02:59,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's legit.

858
01:02:59,967 --> 01:03:01,568
[SPEAKER_04]: The gamer...

859
01:03:02,691 --> 01:03:03,151
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

860
01:03:28,379 --> 01:03:30,140
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of knew a lot of that stuff was coming, though.

861
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:30,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

862
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City had a lot of that video stuff.

863
01:03:34,122 --> 01:03:37,304
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome, and when this game comes out, I'll just have to become a hermit for a while.

864
01:03:38,045 --> 01:03:38,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice knowing you.

865
01:03:42,127 --> 01:03:54,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of people, you know, have been waiting, you know, for the Gran Turismo 5 prologue, but they're going to have to wait even longer for the actual thing, because they're saying it's still about a year away.

866
01:03:56,216 --> 01:03:56,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

867
01:03:57,992 --> 01:04:05,254
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want any type of Gran Turismo 5 at all, your best bet is to get the Glorified demo on April 17th.

868
01:04:05,934 --> 01:04:15,336
[SPEAKER_04]: My problem with the fact that this game is a year away is, assuming that they're using the same engine, and I hope to God that they're not by the time we get around to that, it's going to be so outdated.

869
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:21,777
[SPEAKER_04]: By that time, you're going to have Forza 3 and so many other games that do what they do a lot better.

870
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:23,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

871
01:04:23,597 --> 01:04:25,938
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of not worth it at this point.

872
01:04:26,778 --> 01:04:36,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does it take them so long to model cars when, you know, fucking Project Gotham and all these other games, you know, have cars that look good as well, and they're well modeled.

873
01:04:36,908 --> 01:04:40,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand what's taking them so long to get this game done.

874
01:04:40,652 --> 01:04:42,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like everyone seems to be doing it a lot faster.

875
01:04:43,114 --> 01:04:44,676
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a quote Hippo asks in chat.

876
01:04:44,696 --> 01:04:47,879
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, why the hell do these Gran Turismo games take so damn long?

877
01:04:47,899 --> 01:04:49,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it take that long to sample engine noises?

878
01:04:50,140 --> 01:05:01,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the game looks good, don't get me wrong, but it's just, it's not that much better than, like, Project Gotham or Forza, I mean, or even there's, like, Grid coming out that looks pretty awesome.

879
01:05:02,487 --> 01:05:17,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I don't see what, you know, they're putting a lot of time in, you know, it's kind of like Duke Nukem Forever type, I mean, not so bad, but, you know, Duke Nukem Forever, they're putting all this effort and time into it, and then by the time it comes out, it's just going to be kind of, it'll be good, but it won't be, like,

880
01:05:18,553 --> 01:05:21,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, awesome!

881
01:05:21,934 --> 01:05:29,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Gran Turismo 5 I'm sure will be really big for PlayStation, but will it really be that big of an achievement?

882
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

883
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:40,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't understand why it's taking them so long for this game when Microsoft and other companies can push out these games really quick.

884
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:41,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Just my thing.

885
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:44,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just kind of

886
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:48,475
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

887
01:06:05,185 --> 01:06:05,365
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP Slim

888
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:48,194
[SPEAKER_04]: After all, they were talking that it was going to be a 10-year life cycle for this portable system, so I can see them making some more revisions, but I think it's kind of interesting.

889
01:06:48,214 --> 01:06:52,699
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of sucks for people that bought the Slim and the original and stuff like that, now they have to buy a third one.

890
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:55,003
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

891
01:07:17,415 --> 01:07:18,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have this system.

892
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:21,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, it hasn't released yet, but we're already doing a revision on it.

893
01:07:21,578 --> 01:07:24,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, I'm just going to wait until the new one comes out.

894
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And then no one bought it.

895
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:30,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I got to wonder, like, you know, Nintendo kind of does the same thing.

896
01:07:30,624 --> 01:07:37,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but at the same time, I mean, here's the only difference between, I think, the DS Lite and the PSP.

897
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:42,990
[SPEAKER_04]: The PSP Slim, it limits you to what options you have available for you when you're playing it.

898
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:49,753
[SPEAKER_04]: There's certain applications that you cannot use on the fatter PSP.

899
01:07:49,933 --> 01:07:54,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, the newer PSPs have more RAM and other stuff like that.

900
01:07:54,055 --> 01:07:55,796
[SPEAKER_04]: In short, the battery life.

901
01:07:56,777 --> 01:07:58,277
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the battery life is just the same.

902
01:07:58,317 --> 01:08:00,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think a little bit more improved.

903
01:08:00,198 --> 01:08:04,060
[SPEAKER_04]: But the fact is that... Well, your friend's wrong.

904
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:05,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

905
01:08:07,244 --> 01:08:13,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have, you know, the DS Lite, it basically is a bit slimmer and has a brighter screen.

906
01:08:13,147 --> 01:08:14,107
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's about it.

907
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:20,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, most things that run on the DS Lite will also run on the original DS as well.

908
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:26,452
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not anything that says, okay, you have to have this version of the hardware in order to be able to play this.

909
01:08:27,773 --> 01:08:28,773
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my only thing.

910
01:08:29,254 --> 01:08:31,835
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there were three different versions of the Game Boy Advance.

911
01:08:32,355 --> 01:08:34,276
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that first one that wasn't backlit.

912
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:37,120
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the second one that came out that was backlit.

913
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was the real miniature one that could go on like your keychain.

914
01:08:42,203 --> 01:08:43,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a micro.

915
01:08:43,323 --> 01:08:46,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the Game Boy Advance, the SP, and the micro.

916
01:08:46,686 --> 01:08:48,407
[SPEAKER_05]: The SP was on, and then the micro, yeah.

917
01:08:48,487 --> 01:08:49,948
[SPEAKER_02]: The micro got me through many a line.

918
01:08:51,949 --> 01:08:54,030
[SPEAKER_05]: But the micro didn't do very well overall.

919
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:55,151
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I love it.

920
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:59,994
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem it sucked for is playing... RPGs or anything with text?

921
01:09:00,514 --> 01:09:02,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, even text wasn't so bad.

922
01:09:02,516 --> 01:09:04,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It was playing any type of shooter.

923
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:08,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

924
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:15,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's inevitable they're going to need to update the system since they're not going to just come out with the PSP 2 yet.

925
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:20,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But that kind of still sucks for someone that just bought the system.

926
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:23,448
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be used to it by now.

927
01:09:23,468 --> 01:09:25,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure this PSP 3000 will be unhackable.

928
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:27,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely unhackable in any way.

929
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:38,216
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, let's move on to another Sony-related story, and that has to do with a much-anticipated title, Metal Gear Solid 4.

930
01:09:39,057 --> 01:09:50,444
[SPEAKER_05]: The pre-order DVDs are shipping, and they come with that Metal Gear Online beta keys, and it does announce that the beta is going to begin on April 21st.

931
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:59,490
[SPEAKER_05]: You can download the Metal Gear Online beta on April 17th, so I guess they're giving a little bit of time so that maybe the servers don't all get hammered at once, which probably isn't a bad idea.

932
01:10:00,423 --> 01:10:02,525
[SPEAKER_05]: May 5th is when the beta runs until.

933
01:10:02,885 --> 01:10:04,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So that actually isn't a whole lot of time.

934
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:11,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot I downloaded, well I haven't quite downloaded it yet, but I'm in the Battlefield Bad Company beta.

935
01:10:12,311 --> 01:10:13,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I hear wasn't very good.

936
01:10:13,932 --> 01:10:16,634
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still haven't got a chance to play it yet.

937
01:10:16,814 --> 01:10:19,335
[SPEAKER_04]: But hopefully next week I'll be able to talk about it a little bit.

938
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was another one that was interesting.

939
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:25,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be very curious to hear from some of our listeners who are in on this.

940
01:10:25,562 --> 01:10:34,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't ordered this because I don't really follow Metal Gear Online quite rapidly, but I'd be really curious to hear from some of our fans how this goes, how the online beta is.

941
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:41,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there will be plenty of YouTubes and all that stuff, but I like to hear the first-hand experiences.

942
01:10:42,518 --> 01:10:49,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Well for our listeners in Europe there actually may be an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 out by this summer.

943
01:10:51,125 --> 01:11:04,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now there's only the 40 gigabyte version but there is a little bit of talk going around that indicates there is going to be an 80 gigabyte model coming out.

944
01:11:04,795 --> 01:11:10,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far Sony isn't really doing a good job at saying no about it so maybe it is.

945
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:17,020
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's actually no comment if it's going to even be backwards compatible or anything else good.

946
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:22,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess and say it probably will be as backwards compatible as the 80s over here.

947
01:11:23,163 --> 01:11:25,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Now my question for Europe is, do you want it?

948
01:11:27,526 --> 01:11:28,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, do you really want it?

949
01:11:29,747 --> 01:11:41,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Here would be my thing for Europe, okay, they just announced that they're going to release the 80 gig system there and I mean, they're kind of doing a new one for us with the Metal Gear Solid bundle and I know the same thing in Japan but

950
01:11:43,123 --> 01:11:49,087
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just wait a few more months, I will bet you anything in the fall they will announce yet another SKU.

951
01:11:49,408 --> 01:11:55,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, just like we were talking about before with the PSP and stuff, just wait a little longer.

952
01:11:55,772 --> 01:12:02,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because unless there's something you really need to play right away, you can probably wait a few more months for the better games to be coming out towards the falls.

953
01:12:03,378 --> 01:12:08,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And by that time you can get probably a newer system with better features for either the same price or less.

954
01:12:09,042 --> 01:12:12,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that would be my recommendation.

955
01:12:14,505 --> 01:12:39,451
[SPEAKER_04]: another game you should definitely wait on buying is Eye of Judgment and actually the Eye of Judgment expansion has been having some delays coming to retail and the reason for this Sony says is transportation issues so they're having some problem I guess getting it from Wizards of the Coast to retailers

956
01:12:41,348 --> 01:12:43,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I've Judgment, Byleth, Rebellion 2 Trading Cards

957
01:13:07,106 --> 01:13:13,590
[SPEAKER_04]: and they have yet to set a new launch date for the software and cards but plan to do so in the near future.

958
01:13:16,212 --> 01:13:16,772
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

959
01:13:17,252 --> 01:13:21,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone can buy the expansion because there's not a lot of people that own the game.

960
01:13:21,555 --> 01:13:24,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if anyone at Wizards of the Coast has heard of the Loki bit.

961
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:26,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone really care?

962
01:13:27,018 --> 01:13:27,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, yes.

963
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:29,280
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of our listeners seem to care.

964
01:13:30,681 --> 01:13:31,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is.

965
01:13:32,382 --> 01:13:34,543
[SPEAKER_04]: But Wizards of the Coast couldn't give a rat's ass.

966
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:35,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

967
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:38,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

968
01:13:39,295 --> 01:13:42,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Eye of Judgment plus Let's Ride Friends Forever equals Tingle.

969
01:13:42,902 --> 01:13:46,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheeseburger's a reminder that we also get to count the sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever.

970
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:48,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all five of those.

971
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:50,328
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

972
01:13:50,388 --> 01:13:54,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys, this segment, before we get into the classic game of the week.

973
01:13:54,752 --> 01:13:59,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And those of you guys that remember the good old days of OLR, you can appreciate this.

974
01:13:59,156 --> 01:14:07,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And something that was alluded to a little bit earlier, there is now a Pichi slot machine, which really kind of looks like a slot machine to me.

975
01:14:08,025 --> 01:14:12,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And, oh, I was going to play the video for you guys, but it just got the smackdown taken off of YouTube.

976
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:13,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got another one.

977
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:14,810
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright, don't worry about it.

978
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:17,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Video doesn't do very good over the radio anyway.

979
01:14:17,872 --> 01:14:25,096
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically what happens, I watched it earlier, it looked like a slot machine to me, like one of those more video slot machines you'd see in the casinos.

980
01:14:26,116 --> 01:14:31,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, when the slots come down, when certain symbols come up, you play like a Beatmania bonus game.

981
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:36,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And you use the buttons on the thing to control Beatmania.

982
01:14:37,503 --> 01:14:40,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what, there's something else that's kind of cool.

983
01:14:41,126 --> 01:14:42,947
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the only game that's gotten a...

984
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer

985
01:15:03,257 --> 01:15:03,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Foxhunt Foxhunt

986
01:15:33,393 --> 01:15:33,733
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

987
01:15:55,632 --> 01:15:59,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I bring up slot machines and all that because you know Konami makes a lot of slot machines.

988
01:15:59,776 --> 01:16:02,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the ones you see over here, they make quite a few of those slot machines.

989
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:04,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like another business of theirs we never really talk about.

990
01:16:04,341 --> 01:16:08,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see many of their franchises go into those slot machines and Apache slots.

991
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:11,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly.

992
01:16:11,248 --> 01:16:11,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

993
01:16:12,729 --> 01:16:12,930
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

994
01:16:14,645 --> 01:16:16,766
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week

995
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:52,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is actually one of my favorite RPGs ever, except honestly, it's actually one of the few that I've played quite a bit through in Japanese, until I had a little problem playing through it.

996
01:16:53,289 --> 01:17:02,337
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is Grandia, which is one of the pinnacle, I would say, of Sega Saturn role-playing, you know, for their RPG series.

997
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:05,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Also...

998
01:17:07,265 --> 01:17:21,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It did have quite a few sequels, one of them notably being Grandia 2 that was on Dreamcast that I remember bringing up on the show years ago because I thought it was cool that my Japanese save file worked on the US version.

999
01:17:22,354 --> 01:17:24,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was like, I put it and I was like, where am I?

1000
01:17:24,696 --> 01:17:26,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what anybody's talking about.

1001
01:17:26,917 --> 01:17:28,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, Grandia is...

1002
01:17:30,996 --> 01:17:31,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1003
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:44,917
[SPEAKER_02]: and so it'll follow with you.

1004
01:17:44,937 --> 01:17:48,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a word of warning, the camera works so much better in the Saturn one.

1005
01:17:48,460 --> 01:18:03,592
[SPEAKER_02]: You also get much more of the playfield open than you do with the PlayStation one, which is actually, the 3D looks better in the Saturn one, which is completely baffling to me, you know, since the Saturn didn't have, you know, that tremendous of a 3D processor.

1006
01:18:04,507 --> 01:18:06,428
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have a compass to show you where you go.

1007
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You get treasure chests inside.

1008
01:18:08,729 --> 01:18:10,930
[SPEAKER_02]: A fun story to it, too.

1009
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:16,872
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have skill points that you use to learn your abilities.

1010
01:18:17,233 --> 01:18:20,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a rotational roster for your characters.

1011
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:22,855
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick different ones to have in.

1012
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:27,117
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different types of weapon classes, like swords, maces, whips.

1013
01:18:27,777 --> 01:18:28,558
[SPEAKER_02]: That sort of thing.

1014
01:18:29,518 --> 01:18:35,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And you actually learn your magic as you go through the game by recovering these mana eggs.

1015
01:18:36,343 --> 01:18:37,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

1016
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:39,845
[SPEAKER_02]: The combat system though is what I like best.

1017
01:18:40,025 --> 01:18:41,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you played Evolution, didn't you?

1018
01:18:42,707 --> 01:18:42,867
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1019
01:18:43,207 --> 01:18:43,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you did.

1020
01:18:44,688 --> 01:18:47,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Evolution is another game art title.

1021
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:52,133
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way that the combat works in here is that it's on...

1022
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:55,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can... It's like in Chrono Trigger.

1023
01:18:55,177 --> 01:18:56,579
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the enemies on the screen.

1024
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,503
[SPEAKER_02]: If they see you, they'll rush towards you.

1025
01:18:59,963 --> 01:19:05,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, you can try to avoid them and they'll run into you, but then when you're in combat, it goes overhead.

1026
01:19:06,493 --> 01:19:08,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has...

1027
01:19:10,848 --> 01:19:15,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at it more of as initiative-based, you know, like if you were playing D&D or something.

1028
01:19:16,672 --> 01:19:21,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody has their own sort of speed that their initiative moves at.

1029
01:19:21,716 --> 01:19:25,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll have your slower characters taking longer, your faster ones being faster.

1030
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And you choose your attacks as you're going through.

1031
01:19:30,403 --> 01:19:34,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when that turn comes up, they'll hit and then the enemy will go back and forth.

1032
01:19:34,906 --> 01:19:35,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty...

1033
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:41,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to say it's fairly more realistic than the turn-based style for Final Fantasy games, if you know what I mean.

1034
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob, you're watching it, what do you think?

1035
01:19:44,775 --> 01:19:45,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very interesting.

1036
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:47,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always heard a lot about this game.

1037
01:19:47,337 --> 01:19:49,038
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one of those games I just never got around to playing.

1038
01:19:49,058 --> 01:19:55,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, there were a lot of games, especially this was the period when I was in college, so I didn't play a lot of games.

1039
01:19:55,243 --> 01:19:58,426
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of the one time in my life when I wasn't as into video games as I was the rest of it.

1040
01:19:59,346 --> 01:20:00,647
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks like a lot of fun.

1041
01:20:00,687 --> 01:20:05,571
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to say a sequel of Grandia's is available on GameTap, I want to say.

1042
01:20:05,591 --> 01:20:06,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say, like, Grandia 2 is on there.

1043
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:08,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Grandia 2 was a good one.

1044
01:20:08,073 --> 01:20:12,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was a Grandia 3 and I think a Grandia Extreme, which I haven't played the latter ones.

1045
01:20:13,437 --> 01:20:13,638
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1046
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:15,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing to me.

1047
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Grandia is probably up there in my list.

1048
01:20:18,742 --> 01:20:26,165
[SPEAKER_02]: This would actually, I even like this better than Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VI, if that's an indication of how much I like it.

1049
01:20:26,225 --> 01:20:28,946
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I got my Saturn version was very fun.

1050
01:20:29,487 --> 01:20:33,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the time I got my Saturn version, they were going for about $80 to $100 a piece.

1051
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:36,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought one for $15 that said the discs were damaged.

1052
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:38,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like I'll just rip them and re-burn them, right?

1053
01:20:39,484 --> 01:20:56,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, I, I, this is at Anime Expo, probably the last year I went, and I was going in to watch the Utena movie, and ended up just sitting out in the hall waiting for it to be over, and as I sat and tried to clean the discs, um, I realized that it was, the discs weren't scratched, they actually had stuff on them.

1054
01:20:57,550 --> 01:21:02,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So I cleaned off the discs, it was just like, it looked like, like hot glue.

1055
01:21:03,831 --> 01:21:07,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And cleaned it all off, and lo and behold, I had perfect copies for 15 bucks.

1056
01:21:08,553 --> 01:21:08,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1057
01:21:09,384 --> 01:21:13,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, this did have a PlayStation release that is not nearly as good.

1058
01:21:13,246 --> 01:21:17,749
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the only way you can play it in English is on PlayStation.

1059
01:21:17,909 --> 01:21:20,370
[SPEAKER_02]: And I warn you, it is highly, highly censored.

1060
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:22,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the part where they go in the bar.

1061
01:21:24,132 --> 01:21:27,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's really, really good.

1062
01:21:27,954 --> 01:21:28,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I say give it a try.

1063
01:21:28,775 --> 01:21:32,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, your classic game of the week, boys and girls, Grandia.

1064
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:41,254
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a series I know a lot of people really have a lot of love for so I'm sure that's not going to be disputed by many as a classic game.

1065
01:21:41,474 --> 01:21:44,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, real quick though, I do have the series.

1066
01:21:45,377 --> 01:21:52,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Grandia 2 and Grandia 3 and then the spin-offs were Grandia Digital Museum which is basically a bunch of artwork and voice files and stuff that went with it.

1067
01:21:53,463 --> 01:21:58,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Grandia Parallel Trippers and Grandia Extreme and Grandia Online which I'm going to play Grandia Online.

1068
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:00,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like fun.

1069
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:06,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well that's going to bring part A of our show to a close, but hey, stay tuned.
