00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Mojo.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, March 30th, 2008, gamerscore hackers get the Smackdown from Microsoft,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Rock Band is announced for the Wii, and is another PSP redesign on the way.

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only, DarkSakura.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Roar.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How are you doing? Ah, I'm scared.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Roar.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Are things going good for you?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Fairly decently.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ah, alright. That's good to hear.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How are you doing, Loki?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm fine.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Alright, glad to hear it.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Cool, cool.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, let's start off tonight's show, which is not our last show on lifethusts5.com.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I did a boo-boo in the math last week.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know how I did this, but you know, we got the announcement about, you know,

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
how to make decisions about what the hell is going to happen with the show, the station going offline.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Not the show, but the station going offline in a couple of weeks.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Somehow, I did the math wrong when I looked at the calendar.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I thought tonight was the last show on lifethusts5, but it's actually next Saturday.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Or next...

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Apparently, I still can't read a calendar.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's next Sunday is going to be the last show on lifethusts5.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I somehow missed that there was one more week in March.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So, whatever.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, here we are on March 30th.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
April 6th will be the last show on lifethusts5.com.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then April 13th, something else, which we'll get to in a little bit.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The future of Orange Lounge Radio.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We'll talk about that in a little bit, but I wouldn't want to get away from how we usually start things off with.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
How was your gaming week?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It was very Ragnarok-ing, as usual.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And then I turned on my DS to play some Final Fantasy VI and then turned it off promptly because I ran out of time.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And that was pretty much it.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And we were going to be able to get another pinball machine, but that fell through.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Which pinball machine?

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Attack from Mars.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, I like that one.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
One of the pinball 2000 ones.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, that's one with the holograms in it. I love that one.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But we were sort of dicked around on it, so it fell through.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We played one of those at, like, Huzar one time.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We put rubber bands on the side so that the ball can't fall down.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, lots of fun.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, we were somehow going to get it for $1500 because the guy was selling that and Adam's family and two other machines.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And then the people who were going to go in with Dan and Will to buy it ended up not doing it.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So it was like, oh, yeah, one of the other machines was, like, Fish Tales, which I've never heard of.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And I was like, who owns a fishing pinball machine?

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, yeah.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So it was almost eventful in the realm of pinball.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But, you know, obviously anybody who's been listening to this show for any significant amount of time knows that you have a love obsession with pinball.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Besides Big Bang Bar, the Uber Rare table, what pinball table would you like to own more than anything?

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I actually have a pan list of a couple.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
One of them would actually be Black Knight 2000 because we have actually a Black Knight right now that we're borrowing.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, God, I know what this is called.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's one that's like an airplane theme, like a jet theme.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They had it at Pin-A-Go-Go and it was, the whole game was, like, nothing but ramps, pretty much.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Cool. Fun.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll have to find the name of it.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How about an old school original pinbot? That's what I want more than anything.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The Bride of Pinbot.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The Bride of Pinbot's pretty rad, but I want old school original pinbot.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The one I'm thinking of, though, is Theater of Magic.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Theater of Magic, maybe Addams Family, but Theater of Magic would definitely be on the top of my list.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I mean, I have the machine I want most.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I have World Cup Soccer 94.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That is the machine to me. I have the one I want.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And the husband's not allowed to sell that ever.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ever.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And I have the other one that I really like, which is Twilight Zone.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, cool.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, those two were up there for my two favorite tables.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You know Dr. Who's pinball?

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We actually are working on Still Trying to Get Me a Dr. Who.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Very cool.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I almost bought the TARDIS out of a Dr. Who on eBay, and then I was like, but it's not...

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I remember, like, working, like I said, working in Qzart and it had that yelling in the background

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
because there's just being a little demo loop with EXTERMINATE!

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's like, okay, enough of that.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A Tommy machine wouldn't be bad.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Tommy, can you hear me?

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It has the giant pinball on top.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I like the Jurassic Park pinball.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's when I was like, because the big dinosaur came down and ate your ball.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But my favorite table ever was Addams Family game.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I love that one.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We have a Simpsons pinball party.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That machine's a bitch.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why is that?

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's hard.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh my god, is that the one I...

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And Dan got rid of my Rocky and Bullwinkle, which I really liked.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Aww.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But Stern is bringing out a new Indiana Jones table.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know if I mentioned that.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So that's pretty cool.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, I think last week.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So that's cool.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's pretty cool.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
All right.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sorry.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The market's still there.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There definitely is still a market for pinball.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's fun, and there's still rabid fans for that.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But we're getting off base.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you play for Klonoa 2?

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's that?

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Someone in chat's playing Klonoa 2, and that game's fucking awesome and very depressing.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know what would bring pinball back is if they made a way to make it competitive

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
against, you know, a couple tables.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They've had...

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've actually had sort of like a cocktail machine that had two sides on it.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
At Classic Gaming Expo, and I think I've seen it there, and at Pinagogo, they have the versus

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
tables.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But those are...

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They're not very fun.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If you want to join our chat room so Jamie can have random outbursts at the games you're

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
playing this week, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go do it.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Meanwhile, Loki, I'm thinking you're going to bring us back to console games with your

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
gaming week.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This week I played Crisis Core, so that was pretty cool.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's definitely a lot different than, say, your typical Final Fantasy RPG.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm not sure if it's too similar to 12.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The combat system's sort of real time, I guess.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You run around and you kind of mash buttons, but it's okay.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's very linear so far, but like I said, I'm not that far in the game.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But if it continues the way it is, it's a very linear game.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But it's fun so far.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I love the cutscenes, though.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The cutscenes are pretty awesome.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Then I've also played Saints Row, actually the single player, because I'm trying to finish

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
it before Grand Theft Auto IV comes out.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Almost done with the game, though.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm on the last third.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And then I played just some weird stuff that we'll be probably getting into later, like

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
that Romjek Fail and Tetroid 2012.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That game's weird.

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's like Tetris and Silent Hill with Arkanoid.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I have to see this, because when Loki says, it's Tetris meets Silent Hill, I'm like, what

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the hell is that supposed to mean?

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's weird, though.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
All right.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You've got to check it out.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
All right.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I will.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's pretty much it.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I think I may have played a little bit of Brawl in there, too, at some point.

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The cool thing, though, because mainly this entire week I've been busy trying to get that

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
stupid 360 working, the second one that went down, and finally fixed it, actually.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Basically at a certain point.

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's always when I just say, okay, fuck it.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's not going to work ever again.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm just going to go all out.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What I did was I took the heat gun and really concentrated it on the GPU chip or whatever,

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and I got a different error code.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I found out that the error code means that the RAM has a bad solder joint, and there's

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
a way to fix that.

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You just put a couple washers on there, and you're supposed to superglue them or adhere

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
them to it.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I did that, and then tightened it up, and sure enough, it worked just fine.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now we have one more to go, but this one, that was a lot easier, because I bought a

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
replacement warranty sticker, so I'm going to slap that on there and put the old case

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
back on there and send it to Microsoft.

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I pray it works.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This one didn't work at all.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So far, three out of six have broken, but I fixed two out of the three, so that's not

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
bad so far.

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Nice.

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Is there anything else to report?

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Nothing else?

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's pretty much it.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hopefully we'll have some cool stuff to show Justin.tv later, but right now, that's about

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
it.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,680
Speaking of Justin.tv, we do have a webcam feed of our show.

186
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
It's kind of crap tonight.

187
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,800
I don't know, the Wi-Fi is kind of in and out tonight, so it's been cutting in and out,

188
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,680
but if you want to check it out, www.Justin.tv slash Orange Launch Radio is where our cam

189
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
is at.

190
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,520
Meanwhile, my gaming week, I kind of had a retro week.

191
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
I don't know what it is.

192
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,440
I fired up Xbox Live one day, and I was just like, I'm going to go through and play all

193
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,240
these old games again.

194
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,760
Sometimes you get in that mood for retro, at least I do.

195
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,440
I get in those moods where I want to play Root Beer Tapper today.

196
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,680
Yeah, I've played the game a million times, but it's still one of my favorites from way

197
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
back yonder.

198
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,280
So I was playing Root Beer Tapper, Tempest, and some of the other things on Xbox Live

199
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:04,280
that are not like scream up and down and shout and type wonderful games, but they are classics.

200
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,480
Some of them, I don't even like the upgraded versions, and some of them, I don't think

201
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,280
I like the upgraded version of Tempest nearly as much as the original.

202
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,360
I don't know if it's just like, I can't see as much of what's going on or what have you,

203
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
but whatever.

204
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,720
I got some old achievements that for some reason I never got, so it was kind of fun.

205
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,900
Also checked out that new release, T-Quall, whatever that new puzzle game is on Xbox Live

206
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,280
this week, which is okay.

207
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,280
It's kind of like Tetris meets Luminous, sort of.

208
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,440
You have to make the little blocks that you do in Luminous, but you make them with Tetris

209
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
shaped pieces in different colors.

210
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,580
And it's not just two colors, it's like four different colors.

211
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,480
It's kind of different.

212
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,600
There's a lot of different power ups.

213
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,940
It's interesting though because the presentation of the game, the whole fact that it's kind

214
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,280
of like that tribal jungle Amazon type thing really reminds me of Zuma.

215
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
Yeah, I was going to say that.

216
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,560
No other game has.

217
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,700
It seems like some of the sound effects are ripped right out of Zuma, but yet I don't

218
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,360
believe this game is a PopCap game.

219
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,000
I believe it's made by somebody else.

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
Now the game itself has nothing to do with Zuma.

221
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
I mean, the games themselves are completely separate except for the fact that they're

222
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,660
both puzzle-ish games.

223
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,700
They have that other one too that's just like kind of Zuma or the same tribal thing.

224
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,840
It was, not Crystal Quest.

225
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
It was...

226
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Oh, Magnetica.

227
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,200
No, no, no, no, not like Zuma, I'm talking about the tribal thing, it's an Xbox Live

228
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Arcade game.

229
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Oh, Jewel Quest.

230
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,980
Jewel Quest, yeah.

231
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,760
And Jewel Quest is like bejeweled with one little twist to it.

232
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,840
It's interesting.

233
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,880
But I didn't end up really buying the full version of it because the demo gives you really

234
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,860
good taste of the game and I just, I don't know, I can't keep justifying these little

235
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,480
five and ten dollar purchases for games I'm not going to play more than a couple times.

236
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,460
So that's that.

237
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,680
Some days I do wish Xbox Live would switch to that model of you just pay a point, there's

238
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,480
so many points, just play the game a couple times, you know what I mean?

239
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Like a rental?

240
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,580
Like a regular arcade or a rental, I don't know.

241
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,080
But that'll never happen.

242
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
So.

243
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,440
Gerardimo in chat says, Tikal, or Tikal, how in the hell are you supposed to pronounce

244
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
that even?

245
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Tikal?

246
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
I would guess it would be Tikal.

247
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Tikal?

248
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,320
I think it would be Tikal because the U would not give, there's no U there.

249
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Yeah, all right, Tikal.

250
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,760
It means like T-qual, like Tiki or Tikal.

251
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
I like Tikal.

252
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,680
Gerardimo says Tikal, a mashup of good puzzle games, why did you expect it to be decent?

253
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,040
Because I like puzzle games.

254
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,400
And I would say it's decent, it just didn't, like it didn't wow me.

255
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,720
Like the first time I played Luminous I was like, this game is the shit, I love this game.

256
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,680
It didn't wow me, but it wasn't horrible either.

257
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,200
The other thing I did during my gaming week, you know I'm like, I think I mentioned this

258
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,040
a couple weeks ago on the show, I've been really late to the Steam bandwagon, you know,

259
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,960
on the PC, getting Steam and checking that out, which is kind of like XFire meets Xbox

260
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,640
Live meets an online type store kind of thing on your PC.

261
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,440
I downloaded that a couple weeks ago and I finally bought a game this week.

262
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,840
And the game I bought was Portal, because Loki finally took his copy of the Orange Box

263
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,400
backs a little while ago, and I was very sad I couldn't play that on Xbox 360 anymore.

264
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,280
But the only game in there I was like really, really missing and wanting to play again was

265
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Portal.

266
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,960
And I'll tell you what, big difference, and I know this is like a classic debate, but

267
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,960
it's not something I often think about because I do most of my gaming on console and, you

268
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,080
know, World of Warcraft on the PC and a couple other things here and there, I don't have

269
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,280
to think about this, but there really is a world of difference between keyboard and mouse

270
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,920
and two analog sticks.

271
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Like, I think I actually do a lot better with the keyboard and mouse than I do analog sticks,

272
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
you know?

273
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,720
And, you know, I know it's a classic debate, people say this is better, this is better.

274
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,800
I might actually be a little better at Halo if I could use a keyboard and mouse in it.

275
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,960
And yes, I know I could get Halo 2 and Vista, but I don't have Vista, so.

276
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,240
Well, you can also get one of the, they have the T-mix, the cuter stuff that you can buy

277
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,800
that, you know, can hook up a keyboard and mouse and do it that way.

278
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,040
I do like how you actually fire the portal gun with a PC, your left or right click.

279
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Yeah.

280
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,640
I see, I think that that's a little bit more intuitive.

281
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,440
Yeah, I don't know, I just, I like, I kind of like the feel of it on the PC a little

282
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
better than I did on the Xbox 360.

283
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,080
You know, the Xbox 360, I could still play that on my big screen TV and it was loud and

284
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,320
it was nice, you know, and this one, whereas I have a wide screen monitor out here, it's

285
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,300
not very big, but it's still pretty, so, you know, same game.

286
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,200
You know we love Portal here at Orange Launch Radio, I don't have a lot else to say about

287
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,040
the game, but just kind of making that transition was very interesting, because it's the exact

288
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,160
same game, just playing it two different ways, and I think I actually do a lot better with

289
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,140
the mouse, and I think part of what Jamie said has a lot to do with that, just the way

290
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,920
you control the firing and just the movement is different and all that, so.

291
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,040
It took me a minute to get used to moving, though, because sometimes with the whole WASD,

292
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,680
like I think if you hit two of them at the same time, it gets confused, like, you know,

293
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,160
it's a little unlike World of Warcraft, which also does WASD, but anyway.

294
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,960
One thing I will say about the difference on there, too, just for perspective, I get

295
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,360
more motion sick watching it on a TV.

296
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,300
Is it because it's just bigger, and so more of your vision is taken up by the images?

297
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:34,600
That could possibly be it, but I was watching on a wide screen laptop before.

298
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,560
RossdielUT in chat says, Street Fighter would be an atrocity on a keyboard and mouse.

299
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,680
Yeah, I remember an old, actually, I had Street Fighter II Turbo, Super Duper, whatever it

300
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,560
was, the last big one they did, they had a computer version of it on CD that had Redbook

301
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,480
audio for the different stages, like redone music, and so yeah, I had that on the PC,

302
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,100
and I played it on the keyboard, and it's just not the same, it's just not the same.

303
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,360
And then I go way, way back, and I think about Stick Fighter.

304
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Stick Fighter is fucking awesome.

305
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,680
If you've ever played Stick Fighter, remember that game back in the day?

306
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,560
If you've never played Stick Fighter, it's gotta be out there on the internet somewhere.

307
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,720
It was one of those, like, back in the shareware days.

308
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,960
You probably have to get a slowdown program to make it work okay, I imagine it's like,

309
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,000
way, but Stick Fighter was a Street Fighter II clone, but it used nothing but stick figures,

310
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,360
but they actually stole voice samples out of the game and some of the later versions,

311
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
it was great.

312
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
That was great.

313
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,160
All right, let's get into tonight's housekeeping, since we're done with our gaming weeks, we'll

314
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,440
get into housekeeping tonight, and I know the question on everybody's mind is, okay,

315
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,920
we dropped that bombshell last week, that Orange Lounge Radio is going to be closing

316
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,840
its doors as a live 24 hour a day, seven day a week station as of April 12th.

317
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm sorry, April, yeah, no, April 12th is our last broadcast day.

318
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,020
So you know, there's been a lot of question, and this all came up very last minute for

319
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,020
us last week.

320
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,200
Apparently, we found out about it like 45 minutes before we went live.

321
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,360
So we really had to kind of scramble to figure out what we were going to do.

322
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,680
I want to kind of thank everybody that sent us emails this week and sent us private messages

323
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,960
and all of that sort and posts on forums and things with suggestions for us.

324
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,400
I think I got told to check out about 10 different websites.

325
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,600
A couple people actually offered to host a streaming thing for us.

326
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,280
I wasn't able to do a lot of research on that, but I think that's very cool that people would

327
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,420
do that.

328
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,240
But ultimately, we decided to take things in a different direction, and it was kind

329
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,660
of the first thing that came, it was the first idea that we had here at Orange Lounge Radio

330
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,020
to do with the future of the show.

331
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:51,680
And first, let me say this as well, chat, it's not April Fool's, okay?

332
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,320
It just so happens live 365.

333
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,920
You know, if you've listened to this show long enough, you know we freaking hate April

334
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Fool's Day, okay?

335
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,080
So the last thing we would do is do something crappy like that for April Fool's Day.

336
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,940
This is not an April Fool's joke, okay?

337
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,960
So now I lost my train of thought.

338
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Damn you, chat.

339
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
What was I saying?

340
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Oh, yes.

341
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,760
So the first idea that came to our minds is the one we decided to go with.

342
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,900
So we emailed some people and did some talking, and it looks like everybody's on board.

343
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,840
So this is what's going to happen, folks, starting April 13th, that's episode number

344
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,200
275 of our show, we will now be officially a part of AllGames.com.

345
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,240
We are going to merge, essentially, some of our shows from our station with the operations

346
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,800
they have over at AllGames.com.

347
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:49,160
And in a way, I've been kind of joking all week long, it's creating a Voltron of independent

348
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,080
podcasting, and that's kind of what I really believe in what's going to happen.

349
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,920
Because while we could have set up our own feed and taken one of these offers to set

350
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,800
up our own thing and run our own music feed and live thing, music and all that stuff takes

351
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,240
a long time to set up.

352
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,520
It's more than just putting MP3s at random, trust me for this.

353
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:18,340
So it's kind of like, why would we want to do that and run this whole separate thing

354
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,200
when there's this perfectly established station going on over there that we already have a

355
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,360
good relationship with because our show's been syndicated over on the network.

356
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,880
We know the people there, we like the people over there, we're kind of something different-ish

357
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,380
on the network, it's a type of show they don't have otherwise.

358
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:41,900
Why go run off and do our own thing when we can instead come together and form a bigger

359
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,920
and better station?

360
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,880
Because look at all the experience that's going to be going into this.

361
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,800
You've got All Games, they've been up for what, 10, 11 years, like a shitload long time.

362
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,320
We've been running for five and a half years.

363
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
You take all that experience and bring it together, that's going to be awesome.

364
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,440
And here, let me tell you guys the perks as far as live listener goes.

365
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,320
This means no more registering to sign up to listen up, no more listener caps.

366
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,920
I think there is a listener cap on All Games, but it's like 1,000 or some ungodly number

367
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,760
will never hit.

368
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,600
There's the fact that you can listen to it on your PSP now.

369
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,760
If you check out allgames.com on your PSP, and I believe it's one of the preset stations

370
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,160
in the PSP as well.

371
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,320
It's going to be a good thing.

372
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,280
The more and more I think about it, the more I think this is the right idea for us.

373
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:34,560
Here also, I have no announcements at this time as far as our other shows go, speaking

374
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:42,260
of Travis Donovan and DMN, however, we are in talks to have that be a part of the merge,

375
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,320
and they didn't say no.

376
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Right now, that's all in limbo.

377
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,120
I have nothing further to say at this time, but that is exciting that some of our other

378
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,720
stuff will probably go over there as well if everybody's happy.

379
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,560
Let's put it that way.

380
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,480
I think it'll be good though.

381
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,160
I think it's going to be a great thing.

382
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Anything else you guys want to add?

383
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I got nothing to add.

384
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Nothing to add?

385
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Dark Sakura?

386
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
I like pastrami.

387
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
You like pastrami?

388
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,720
Yes, none of the content of our show is going to change, and that's the other great thing

389
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,340
about this mergingwithallgames.com is that they know our shtick.

390
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,480
They know what we do.

391
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,160
They don't want us to change anything, so we're not going to.

392
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,180
We might do some aesthetic type changes with this move, like we might take the opportunity

393
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,140
to clean up our album art, maybe do a different audio.

394
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,860
We might make some small aesthetical changes, but as far as the content that you're actually

395
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,120
going to hear in the show, nothing's going to change in that regard.

396
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,120
According to Jamie, there will be more pastrami.

397
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,240
There may be more pastrami.

398
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,440
We'll have to work on that, but nothing's going to change.

399
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,100
As far as podcasts go, if you guys are listening on the podcast only and you've never been

400
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,480
able to join us for the live experience, not a damn thing's going to change for you, really.

401
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,520
We might experiment with some different sound qualities because we're actually going to

402
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,040
be broadcasting a higher quality over on allgames.com than we were here, so we might change some

403
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,400
things in the way we're distributing the podcast, but honestly, you're not going to have to

404
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,600
change your subscription or anything like that.

405
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,880
You're still going to get the podcast.

406
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,560
It's like nothing ever happened for you guys if you've never listened to us live.

407
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
It's going to be like nothing ever happened.

408
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,480
I hate to say it, even though the sound may be in higher quality, the show will not.

409
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,520
Yes, the show will not be in higher quality, I'm sorry to say.

410
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
There it is.

411
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
I don't know.

412
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,760
Is there anything else to add?

413
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Anything else we should say?

414
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
I don't think so.

415
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm out of soda.

416
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
That's not good.

417
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,840
When I say no content change, that also means everything the live folks are used to, like

418
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,340
the little special thing we do after the show that we call the afterbirth, that is actually

419
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,600
not going away, and I was very surprised.

420
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,000
I thought we might have to make some changes to that, but they were very open, and we don't

421
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,040
have to change anything about our afterbirth.

422
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Very excited.

423
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,360
We don't have to change anything.

424
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,320
Oh, well, maybe we'll have to remove the segment of Make Fun of Bobby Black Wolf.

425
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,440
Oh, yeah, we will have to get rid of the Make Fun of Bobby Black Wolf segment, probably,

426
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,760
but that's all right.

427
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,520
I think that's about it.

428
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,300
Nothing else to say, so I guess we're going to move into... I'm wondering if there's

429
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,880
any other questions in chat.

430
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
Let's see.

431
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,720
Am I still able to tune in with iTunes and WinApp?

432
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,880
Yes, and you'll be able to do it a whole lot easier, actually, because you don't have to

433
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:26,720
register for Light

434
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:35,480
of the Week.

435
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,600
I need it easier than that.

436
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
I don't.

437
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,680
Bookmark it.

438
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,960
I don't know what else to tell you.

439
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,040
Zlatan asks, will it be 30 seconds behind Live 365?

440
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,580
I do not think the buffer will be as great, because I think we're having to... Because

441
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,600
right now we send from my computer to Live 365, who encodes it to their server that's

442
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,720
in... I don't think it's going to be as much of a delay.

443
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,960
I think there will still be a delay, but that's inevitable because of the encoding process,

444
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,240
but it won't be like 30 seconds.

445
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
It'll be an hour.

446
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,400
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf is in chat helping to clear the air right now.

447
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Thank you, Bobby.

448
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,920
He actually says it still will be 30 seconds, but that's just inevitable, because it's buffer

449
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
and all that stuff.

450
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,320
Rasteel UT says, fuck that.

451
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,740
Bring Black Wolf on and make fun of him.

452
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,920
We just might do that, actually.

453
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,680
No, we love Bobby, of course.

454
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,960
Bobby has actually been very instrumental in making this happen, so we love Bobby.

455
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,080
Actually, that's another really good thing, is because when we're live on Sunday nights,

456
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,940
Bobby's show airs at 5 o'clock, and he says that he's going to keep his show to an hour.

457
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,440
Maybe occasionally he'll run over, but very little.

458
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,800
The nice thing is, is that instead of having just kind of like music as a lead in, we're

459
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,440
going to have a really good quality show.

460
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,760
It's almost like being on a real television network, where you have a quality show as

461
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,400
a lead in to your show.

462
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,880
It's going to be great, and I think the listeners are really going to benefit, and we're all

463
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,660
going to benefit, because we'll get some of Bobby's people, he'll get some of our people.

464
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,400
That's all goes into the Voltron of independent podcasting, the future.

465
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,640
It's like when they have heroes on, and then they have Chuck, and then everyone turns the

466
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,320
TV off when Chuck comes on.

467
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,160
Well, I'm hoping it doesn't go like that, but maybe.

468
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Rob.

469
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
What?

470
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,000
Will it blend?

471
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,080
It may indeed blend.

472
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,080
We'll see.

473
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,080
We2 in chat says, as usual, OLR is the gamer tech podcast, whatever happened to OLR Food

474
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
Network.

475
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,920
OLR Food Network is still here.

476
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,520
Pastrami, Jamie?

477
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
Yum.

478
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
All right.

479
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,920
With cheese and grilled onions, and no burger.

480
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
All right.

481
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
I'm so mad.

482
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,760
So this is going to be a good thing, but regardless, we really appreciate those of you guys that

483
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,520
have supported our own live feed over the past five and a half years of our music feed.

484
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,380
I know some of you guys were listening to us at work, but now you have allgames.com

485
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
to listen to.

486
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
You always did.

487
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,060
They play music during the day.

488
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,640
They play a different mix of video game music than we did, but it's a good mix of music.

489
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,040
It's a little more current mix of music in some regards, and they also have talk radio

490
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,400
that plays throughout the day, which I think is highly entertaining, and you never know

491
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
what might happen in the future.

492
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
You never know.

493
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,680
This is going to free all of us up to kind of be working towards a more common goal now

494
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,080
and working on kind of the visibility of the same radio station.

495
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
It's going to be a good thing.

496
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
All right.

497
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
I'll shut up.

498
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
I'll stop talking about it.

499
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
We're beating this topic into the ground.

500
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,640
Let's get into tonight's gaming news.

501
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Loki.

502
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,320
Speaking of beating stuff into the ground, Activision's Guitar Hero Aerosmith has announced

503
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,580
its first few tracks that will be available for, I guess, fans of Aerosmith.

504
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:46,480
Of course, included in these are Make It, Uncle Salty, Draw the Line, No Surprise, and

505
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,080
Sweet Emotion.

506
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
That's kind of neat.

507
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,840
There's going to be, I guess, 40 plus songs in the game.

508
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,760
Sixty percent of it, of course, I guess, will be devoted to Aerosmith.

509
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,560
In fact, actually, I saw the way they kind of have it set up is neat.

510
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,240
You're going to be doing different sets, I guess, follow their career a little bit.

511
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,620
They'll have two songs that are openers that are from a different band, and then they'll

512
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,880
have three Aerosmith songs, maybe a bonus song or something like that, and they're going

513
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,400
to have different sets set up like that.

514
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,240
As long as it's better than Guitar Hero Rocks the 80s, right?

515
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,720
I think it will be.

516
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
What do you think?

517
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,980
What do you think is the sellability of a game like this that really focuses on one

518
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,980
band?

519
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,120
I know, yeah, they might have songs from other bands in it, like I heard they're going to

520
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:44,240
have Lenny Kravitz and people that have worked with Aerosmith, but Aerosmith's name is on

521
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
the cover.

522
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
It's Steve Tyler's lips.

523
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,800
Yes, and those big old lips are on the cover.

524
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,160
Is that going to be enough, do you think, to sell this game?

525
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,400
Maybe, but here's the thing.

526
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,100
I would just, the easiest way to decide if you want this game or not, just wait until

527
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:05,960
they get down to the point where they announce the entire soundtrack to the game.

528
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,720
My guess is they're not going to have download content for this game.

529
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,100
It's probably just going to be these songs and that's it, because why would they cut

530
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,020
into their Guitar Hero 3 download content, which of course is still going to be going

531
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,600
on until Guitar Hero 4 comes out.

532
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,880
If it's just something that sounds like you may like, if you're a fan of Aerosmith, great.

533
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,720
It's more power to you.

534
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,040
If you hate Aerosmith, you probably won't buy this game.

535
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,960
I think we can all be in agreement.

536
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,220
A lot of these music games are really starting to melt, get to the point of getting sick

537
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,220
of this.

538
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,400
In fact, we'll be getting to some other stuff later, like Sing Star.

539
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,300
I'm thinking part of the reason that makes this so alluring is that it looks like they're

540
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,220
just using the same damn engine from Guitar Hero 3.

541
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,280
It's updated a little bit.

542
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,520
The engine itself is actually upgraded a bit.

543
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,000
Define a little bit.

544
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,840
The graphics are a little bit better, animations are recaptured and they're a lot smoother.

545
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Stuff like that.

546
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,080
But yeah, it's basically Guitar Hero 3.

547
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,400
Gerardimo in chat, chat.orangewellandshare.com, suggests Guitar Hero ABBA mix.

548
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
I'd be down with that.

549
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,760
But do they use any real guitar?

550
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,600
No, but you know, they have an opening for a drummer, so they might be Drum Hero.

551
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
No, I have to laugh though.

552
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
You're going to love this.

553
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,760
Well, I have to laugh because on the trailer, you know how they have all the little logos

554
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,920
of the different people that have products in the game and stuff like that, and Gibson

555
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
was on there?

556
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,480
I'm like, oh, that's funny.

557
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Oh, the irony.

558
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Ironic.

559
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,400
Very ironic.

560
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
It's like Ray-Ain.

561
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:48,540
Well, we'll hear more about Guitar Hero Aerosmith in the future, I'm sure, as we get closer

562
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,540
to the release date.

563
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:57,000
Another game we're hearing more and more about is Ninja Gaiden 2, which looks bloody fantastic.

564
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Emphasis on bloody.

565
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It looks wonderful.

566
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,420
Ninja Gaiden 2, if you want to see all that blood, the demo is going to be coming in May.

567
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,420
May is going to be the delivery of the Ninja Gaiden 2 demo.

568
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,840
That is according to Microsoft's Ninja Gaiden 2 website.

569
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,880
And apparently, there's also supposed to be some exclusive content beginning on April

570
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
15th.

571
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,360
But if it's anything like previous exclusive content, it's probably crappy gamer picks

572
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,200
and crappy themes, and maybe some cool-looking trailers.

573
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,960
But I wouldn't expect that there's going to be like, you know, a pre-demo.

574
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,840
I mean, I don't think you can have it.

575
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,680
So I'm pretty sure it's just gamer picks and stuff.

576
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,940
The game, by the way, comes out on June 3rd, and I think there's a lot of folks that are

577
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,940
very excited about it.

578
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Ninja Gaiden Hi-Rez.

579
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:48,880
I miss, what was her name from Ninja, Irene.

580
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,320
I miss her from the original game.

581
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,760
Remember the CIA agent or whatever she was?

582
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,680
Those cutscenes were so frickin' epic back then in the NES days.

583
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,780
Now you expect cutscenes in your games.

584
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,800
Back then, epic.

585
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Just epic.

586
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:09,080
Well, one thing that we've talked about on the show before is the Penny Arcade game that's

587
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:15,600
supposed to be, well, an episodic series, Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice

588
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
of Darkness.

589
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,200
There is a price out for it now, $19.95, which would be about half that numeric value in

590
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,880
pounds for our UK listeners, and that's just for the Windows, Mac, and Linux version of

591
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
the game.

592
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,000
It's going to be released on Linux, that's cool.

593
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,720
There is an Xbox Live Arcade version that will have a simultaneous launch, no price

594
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
released yet.

595
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,360
Five to ten hours of playing for you, so that's pretty cool.

596
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,120
Ninja Gaiden No, it's weird.

597
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,880
I thought that they were saying that the, I want to say that the Xbox Live Arcade version

598
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:01,780
was going to be $20, which I thought was kind of surprising, seeing as they haven't really

599
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,720
had a game that would spend $20.

600
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,560
I think the most was like Luminous with $15 and stuff, but $20 for that game is really

601
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
expensive.

602
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,760
Penny Arcade It is a little steep.

603
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,040
Ninja Gaiden This game better be epic as well, for $20.

604
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,800
Penny Arcade I'm going to pay that much money, I'll just

605
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
get it on Windows.

606
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,000
Ninja Gaiden But, yeah, I was going to say, you know, $20

607
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,400
is kind of the average of your $19.95 is what you pay for a low budget Windows game, so

608
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,920
is it really that obscene of a price on Xbox Live?

609
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,460
Not really, you know, but as long as the game is quality, that's what's important.

610
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:38,100
You know it has a great tie-in, you know, I don't know a lot of gamers who don't love

611
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,020
Penny Arcade, or at least like and respect it a lot, so you know it's going to be at

612
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,840
least the quality there, it's just the question of, but will it be, it's kind of like that

613
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,440
question, will it blend?

614
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Will it blend into a game?

615
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
We'll see.

616
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,760
Ninja Gaiden Yeah, now a game that we're probably not

617
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:01,560
going to get over here, unfortunately, Raiden Fighters Aces has gotten a demo on the Japanese

618
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Xbox Live, of course I think some of us who have Xbox Live accounts in Japan might be

619
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,680
able to download that, I haven't tried it yet though.

620
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:16,360
Now Raiden Fighters Aces is, I believe, just a collection of the three Raiden Fighters

621
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:24,400
games, of course Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, Operation Helldive, and Raiden Fighters

622
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:34,240
Jet, or actually all three of those from the late 90s, and great top-down shooter games.

623
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,240
You know, there was, back in the day on the Playstation, there was just, for the first

624
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,840
two Raiden games, you know before these came out, there was a compilation on there, I would

625
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,560
like to see one that's all of them.

626
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,560
That would be a big compilation.

627
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,520
That would be a very big compilation.

628
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,640
That would be epic.

629
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,120
You know what that compilation's called?

630
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
MAME.

631
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:04,840
Actually, the boards for the first three Raiden games have been intensely difficult for them

632
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
to crack.

633
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,480
I think that they've only gotten, they haven't, as far as I know they haven't cracked Raiden

634
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
DX yet.

635
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,480
That game was fun, we had that at our round table.

636
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,120
I like the electric one that latches on and does the swirly bit.

637
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
That was my favorite one.

638
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Yeah.

639
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,760
Very cool.

640
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,400
Alright, well, talking about games coming from Japan and shooter games, you know, I

641
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,360
guess somebody out there was just thinking to themselves, like, you know, we don't have

642
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,520
enough shoot-em-up games on Xbox Live.

643
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
We really don't.

644
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
We need more.

645
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,920
And luckily, though, one of the granddaddies of shoot-em-up games is on its way to Xbox

646
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Live Arcade.

647
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
It's Ikaruga.

648
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,280
So I guess we can make room for that.

649
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,120
We can find room in there somewhere.

650
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,080
And of course, we've been having rumors about this game for a couple weeks now, and the

651
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,600
latest one, I think last week we had the month nailed down as April, well, this week, thanks

652
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:06,040
to the Japan's version of Xbox.com, we now know that the release date is set to be April

653
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
9th.

654
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,880
Now, of course, all these types of things are always subject to change, and who knows,

655
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,400
the Japanese website could have been wrong, but, you know, it does look pretty likely

656
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,280
it's going to be out in early April rather than later, which isn't a bad thing because

657
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Ikaruga is pretty awesome.

658
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,600
It is pretty awesome.

659
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,240
So I guess we can make room for one more shooter if it's Ikaruga.

660
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,680
You know what?

661
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,320
You know what I would rather see than Ikaruga?

662
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
What?

663
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,520
Radiant Silver Gun.

664
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
You never know.

665
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
I wish.

666
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:44,560
Well, in other news as far as games to be out, and this is actually more of a leak from

667
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:53,400
the ESRB, and this would be also for Xbox Live, Darwinia is supposed to be coming out

668
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
and it actually was confirmed.

669
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,440
It's actually listed as Darwinia Plus, Survival of the Flat, or, which is, okay, from what

670
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,780
I'm understanding on here, it's a multiplayer version, Multiwinia, Survival of the Flattest,

671
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,160
so it's fairly interesting.

672
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,600
We've had a lot of people tell us about this game that it's supposed to be really good,

673
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:20,120
but there's actually a demo out for Windows, Mac, and Linux right now.

674
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:25,200
Quel Tipo in chat says, screw Darwinia, I want Darwin awards the game.

675
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,240
Isn't that just pain on PlayStation Network?

676
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
I'm not sure.

677
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,000
That sounds sort of like it.

678
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,040
But no, Darwinia, I've heard nothing but good things about Darwinia, so it's kind of neat

679
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,640
that these little games are getting this more massive distribution, and I'm assuming from

680
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,960
the whole Plus in the name, there's going to be a lot of extra futures, which probably

681
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,200
will be justifying the cost of it on Xbox Live, but I look forward to an easy way to

682
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
check it out.

683
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:58,480
Well, if anyone wants to check out the demo, go to introversion.co.uk slash Darwinia, and

684
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,480
you can download the demo there.

685
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Very cool.

686
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,400
Another game we can look forward to around Christmas this year, of course, for whatever

687
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,880
reason, Microsoft likes to release at least one family game around that time.

688
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,640
This year, instead of, and I can only hope that's instead of, Viva Pinata and Viva Pinata

689
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:27,520
Party Animals, and probably another Viva Pinata sequel, we get Banjo Kazooie 3, and to be

690
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,920
honest, I had never played the original game.

691
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,840
It's a headache.

692
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,560
No interest from me whatsoever, but hey, I know a lot of people liked it.

693
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,280
I played it once, and I know it has a rabid fan base because of its quirky sense of humor.

694
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Yes.

695
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,860
If you're looking forward to it, I would say you're probably going to see it in November.

696
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,480
How highly anticipated do you think this game is?

697
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,920
One thing I also know about Banjo Kazooie is that it's been a long time since there's

698
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,420
been a game in this series.

699
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:02,720
They teased it at E3 last year, but that's probably the last we've heard of it.

700
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
I don't know.

701
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
It'll be neat.

702
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,640
I mean, they need some good family games, I guess, because Viva Pinata's not that great.

703
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
No offense.

704
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
No, no, no.

705
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
There's people that love Viva Pinata.

706
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,960
I think the wrong people that Microsoft thought were going to get into Viva Pinata got into

707
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Viva Pinata.

708
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Here's the thing.

709
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,200
They should take a note from it that they need a good sim game on the Xbox 360, okay?

710
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,600
Then what they should do, though, Viva Pinata, though, it's not like your traditional platform

711
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
gamer game.

712
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,960
I think that's going to appeal to a lot of people because they like their Marios and

713
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
stuff like that.

714
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,760
But I think Banjo Kazooie is going to have kind of the same effect as Ratchet and Clank

715
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,380
and that kind of stuff.

716
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,520
Maybe not so popular, but it'll still be pretty decent.

717
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,200
Hopefully decent enough for Banjo Kazooie 4 for fans of the series.

718
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,260
So we'll see.

719
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,240
Gold Banjo in chat says Banjo Kazooie is awesome.

720
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,960
That's what my screen name is named after.

721
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,020
So if you want to know where the Banjo in Gold Banjo comes from, there it is.

722
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,020
I was not aware of that.

723
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,440
I was not either, but now I know.

724
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
The more you know.

725
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
All right.

726
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
I know it's half the battle.

727
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Something else you should be aware of.

728
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,220
If you are cheating on Xbox Live, you're about to get spanked by Microsoft because you've

729
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,100
been very, very naughty.

730
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,400
Here's the deal is that Microsoft has been going through and finding people who have

731
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,880
been cheating in games doing save game hacks and how do people cheat their game or score?

732
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Loki, you ought to know this stuff.

733
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,120
Why would I know this stuff?

734
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,240
Just because I know you would know this stuff.

735
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,900
Well, apparently there's some workarounds that they can actually do where it hacks their

736
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,720
actual profile that you don't even need to play the game to get the achievement points

737
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
from.

738
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Wow.

739
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,840
That's what they're really cracking down on is stuff like that.

740
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Interesting.

741
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Well.

742
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,080
Because you can't do the save stuff anymore.

743
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,820
They have that stupid digital rights management thing that they threw in there to fuck everybody

744
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,440
over with everything.

745
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,440
That stopped people from save swapping and stuff like that.

746
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,640
And not all the games worked with save swapping, so it was very unreliable stuff.

747
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,400
Well, here's the thing is that now for these people, their score is getting zapped to zero.

748
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,680
Their gamer score is getting completely erased, gone.

749
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,360
And if you look at their profile on Xbox.com, there's a big old little question mark on

750
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,960
their profile and it says, what happened to their gamer score?

751
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,920
They've been caught cheating.

752
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,800
So now these folks basically get the scarlet question mark, or it's more of the orange

753
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,680
question mark on their profile that labels them as a cheater.

754
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,000
I can't wait because I'm not too optimistic on Microsoft and picking people that cheat.

755
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,800
And I have a feeling they're going to make some mistakes in there and they're going to

756
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,860
pick people that did not cheat and they're going to mark them as cheaters and that's going

757
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,120
to have a whole backlash thing.

758
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,880
I mean, I would just ban these people from Xbox Live.

759
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Why aren't they just doing that?

760
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,240
Because they seem to do that with everything else.

761
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,200
I don't understand why they just have to...

762
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,480
Making examples of them.

763
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,520
Well, that's fine.

764
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,040
I have no problem with them making examples of them, but I have a feeling that they're

765
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,940
going to get some people that really didn't cheat.

766
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,960
Why's it got to be an orange question mark?

767
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
What's wrong with orange?

768
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,480
You got a problem with orange, Microsoft?

769
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
Why's it got to be an orange question mark?

770
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Jerks.

771
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,920
Well, it's kind of a gold orange.

772
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Shut up.

773
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,440
But, no, I don't think at the same time Microsoft is like running rampant accusing everybody

774
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
of being a witch.

775
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
You know?

776
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
Witch!

777
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
Cheetah!

778
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Burn the cheetah!

779
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
We found a witch.

780
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
May we burn her?

781
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,520
I don't think Microsoft is running through the village accusing everybody of being a

782
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
witch.

783
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,720
I think they just targeted some of the high profile people like Strip Club GJ.

784
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,120
You know, that guy.

785
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,720
And I just know him because he actually messaged me once because I got DDR universe the day

786
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,640
it came out and I was playing it all day long and I had like 500 gamer score and I must

787
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,920
have had one of the higher gamer scores I had had anybody that day because he messaged

788
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,880
me and he was like, how was the game?

789
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
Is it good?

790
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,560
Is it easy to get the gamer score?

791
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,320
So I remember him because I laughed my ass off when I saw I was getting this message

792
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,840
from him and I heard he was one of the people that got caught with this and sure enough,

793
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
yes he is.

794
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Oh, he was?

795
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Yes, he was.

796
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:16,320
And he's got the profile on Xbox.com and he's got the, he's a witch, witch, witch, witch,

797
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
burn him!

798
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,960
I almost have 10,000 gamer points.

799
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,880
No thanks to my friend playing Rock Band for me.

800
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,720
But that's not cheating in the sense of Microsoft cheating.

801
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,720
Sairan says, how do you know it's a cheater?

802
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
It looks like one!

803
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
They turned me into a Yaris.

804
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,560
Turned me into a- I got better.

805
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,440
Trip Club DJ made me play Yaris.

806
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,360
That's punch like that.

807
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,360
Burn him!

808
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,000
How do you know they're a cheater?

809
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Build a game out of them!

810
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,900
Let's just hope it doesn't become a witch hunt but Microsoft's been pretty good about

811
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,600
covering their ass because they're saying like, you know, what if somebody calls them

812
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,360
and said my brother did it?

813
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,400
Then Microsoft already has it out there.

814
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,280
Too bad because it's in the terms of agreement.

815
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,680
You're not supposed to share your gamertag with other people.

816
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,680
So nah, nah, nah, nah.

817
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,480
What if you didn't share it but they didn't put any sort of password protection on the

818
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,480
account and when you weren't there, someone used your account and cheated.

819
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
Witch!

820
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,160
Because you're a witch and you share your account, evil witch.

821
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,600
Well it's just like- Not all witches are evil!

822
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,480
Just like if your thing read rings or whatever and you happen to have plugged it into a surge

823
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
protector.

824
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,040
You're like, oh see, that's why.

825
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,520
That's why our graphics chip fucked up.

826
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,200
It's because you plugged it in a surge protector.

827
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,200
That's true.

828
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,080
We wouldn't want to forget about Glenda the Good Witch.

829
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
No.

830
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,080
I know.

831
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,360
Nowadays, being a witch is religious.

832
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,760
I know, I know.

833
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,920
Witch is a very broad term.

834
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,400
You know what we're parodying here, Jamie.

835
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:56,120
It should be a Goomba hunt.

836
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,760
It should be a release date!

837
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,920
Yeah, how about that?

838
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,760
I got some release dates right here, okay?

839
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,560
Um, I have four.

840
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,880
And two of them are the same game.

841
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,640
Alright, what's that?

842
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:16,640
So, um, Baroque on the first for PS2 and Wii, and Condemned 2 Bloodshot on Xbox 360 and

843
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
PS3.

844
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,640
And that's it.

845
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,440
Now, how can she predict the future about all these games coming out in the UK?

846
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,240
It's because she's a witch!

847
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,240
No.

848
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,240
Witch!

849
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,800
No, it's because I have reliable sources.

850
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Oh, okay.

851
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
So, no.

852
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
Reliable witch sources!

853
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,040
Alright, let the joke die, Jesus.

854
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,240
And lit some charcoal and read it in the smoke.

855
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,400
No, I want the witch hunt joke to die now before it gets too old.

856
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,040
Just watch, there's going to be a wiki on it now.

857
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,560
I love the OLR wiki more than anything.

858
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
It's so great.

859
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,560
Sorry.

860
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Alright, uh, Loki, what's coming out in the US?

861
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,960
Not a whole lot of good stuff, unfortunately.

862
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:05,840
No, this time around we get some crap, including Rafa Nadal Tennis on the DS.

863
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,440
I think that came out already, but eh, whatever.

864
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,400
It's probably a GameStop exclusive, but that's okay, it sucks.

865
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,600
Octomania got delayed, I guess, a week or so.

866
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,280
That's now coming out on the Wii, $19.99 for a puzzle game, and it has online, so that's

867
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
not bad.

868
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,040
And it's Atlus, you gotta support Atlus.

869
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:34,360
And let's see, Mana Kima Alchemist of Aurovis, and that's a new Koei RPG for Playstation

870
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,420
2.

871
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,120
There's a game called Toy Shop, which is coming out on the DS, I guess it's like a sim toy

872
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,240
shop game.

873
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,520
And let's see here, Call of Duty 4 Game of the Year Edition, that's coming out on the

874
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,700
first as well.

875
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:56,080
That's just a re-release of Call of Duty 4 with the downloadable map pack, or token for

876
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,080
that.

877
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,080
So if you don't have it yet, that's probably the way you want to go.

878
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:14,520
And let's see here, there's also World Championship cards on the PSP, but that's pretty much it.

879
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,760
Let's head on over to Japan and look at the release dates over there, really nothing to

880
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,720
look forward to on Xbox 360, I'm sorry to say.

881
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:27,280
There is stuff on Playstation 3, if you like Eye of Judgment, you can get some of the expansions

882
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,520
over there, that's about it.

883
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,880
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, gosh, really not a lot there as well.

884
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,360
This is a very slow week in Japan as far as the next gen systems go.

885
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:47,160
Well on the Playstation 2 you get Pro Yaku Spirits 5 comes out, which is another baseball

886
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,160
simulator game, so there's that, I suppose, to look forward to.

887
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,440
And let's see if there's anything on the handhelds, surely there's got to be something on the

888
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,440
Nintendo DS.

889
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,320
No, there's really not.

890
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:02,640
Oh, on April 3rd there is some stuff coming out.

891
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:11,400
Let's see, there's One High Ten Fun de Igaju Zunikakuru DS, from Bondi comes a game called

892
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
Detective Conan.

893
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,120
That's an interesting and old school anime series.

894
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:21,100
There's a new game coming out there, and this game coming from a group called FonFon, is

895
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:28,160
the publisher for this one, Kuchan no Shiwashi Kantan Oriuri Recipe comes out, and it looks

896
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,240
like a cooking game, or it could be, I don't think it's cooking, I think this is actually

897
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,240
like a virtual cookbook.

898
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,560
It looks like it has like 300 recipes in a little virtual cookbook.

899
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,360
They were supposed to release something like that out here, but they never did.

900
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,320
Well you can import this one, except I hope you can read Japanese, or it's really not

901
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,760
going to do you a lot of good.

902
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,160
Well then you probably aren't going to be able to do it.

903
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,720
Anything on the PSP?

904
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,440
Yes, Star Ocean Second Evolution comes out on the Sony PSP from Squeenix.

905
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
That's pretty cool.

906
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,280
Yeah, so that would probably be one of the bigger releases in Japan this week, otherwise

907
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,640
you've got to really wait until next week.

908
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,540
Not a lot of big releases in Japan this week, I guess it's a slow week all around, but probably

909
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:07,800
because we're kind of in a little bit of a slow period until we get into like the summer

910
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,760
games, then we'll see a lot of stuff.

911
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,100
Out of curiosity real quick before we get into the next story, because summer games

912
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,800
reminded me, there's the Olympics this year, yet outside of Mario and Sonic at the Olympics,

913
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,920
I haven't heard of a lot of like Beijing video games.

914
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,920
What's up with that?

915
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,520
It seems like every year there's an Olympics, there's some horrible games.

916
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,320
Sega is putting out an Olympics game in June.

917
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,320
Is there?

918
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,320
Oh, okay.

919
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,200
Beijing Olympics, oh wait, so yeah, there is one coming.

920
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,200
Is it coming on the Wii?

921
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,720
PS3 and Xbox 360.

922
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,720
No Wii.

923
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,160
Oh, maybe they don't want it to interview with Mario and Sonic at the Olympics one.

924
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,160
Interesting.

925
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,560
I don't know about that, but there is one coming.

926
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,960
Interesting.

927
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,400
What are you giggling about over there, dare I ask?

928
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,840
I'm looking at the listener profiles on our wiki, and while still you tease is great.

929
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,640
Poor guy.

930
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,640
I know, I'm sorry.

931
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,760
Stop picking on him.

932
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:14,560
I didn't want to pick on him, but I just did not expect it, so I was like, okay.

933
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,100
Gerardimo said, Sky, why is that bad?

934
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:22,800
It's not necessarily bad, I'm just curious, and usually these Olympic games are fucking

935
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,960
horrible anyway, but I'm just curious, because I was surprised I haven't heard a lot about

936
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,320
tie-in games when the Beijing Olympics are kind of a big deal.

937
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,880
You want to hear something weird?

938
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,880
What's that?

939
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,480
That's a tough topic here, but next week there's a game, or not next week, but the week after

940
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,600
next there's a game on the DS coming out called Plushies.

941
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,480
That reminds me of like, Furries.

942
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
Oh no.

943
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,880
I want my ferret, Rob.

944
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,880
Let the jokes begin.

945
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,920
I want my ferret.

946
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,920
You want the ferret?

947
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,920
Yeah.

948
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,440
We might be able to make that happen, but not unless you read us more news.

949
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,520
I have some news.

950
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,760
Sony has said they're sorry.

951
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,760
We already knew they were sorry, but they've also apologized too.

952
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:12,060
They now have some updates to the PS3 store, and one of them is Gran Turismo 5 Prologue,

953
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:21,320
which for the UK is $24.99, with UEFA Euro 2008 demo and Unreal Tournament 3 for free,

954
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:29,960
and Turok Map Packs for $1.99, and the Eye of Judgment Bio-Rebellion card set for $6.99.

955
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:39,800
Also PS1 Reel Fishing has been added for $3.49 to PS3 and PSP stores.

956
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:47,280
Oh, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, give me.

957
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
Hi ferret.

958
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,880
It has a ferret now.

959
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,960
Yes, I found the damn ferret.

960
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,860
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

961
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:59,920
There's also trailers on the PS3 store for Everybody's Golf World Tour, Eye of Judgment,

962
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:14,720
GT5 Prologue, Dark Sector, and Dynasty Warriors 6, and Sony said, we sorry, poo, poo on us.

963
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,440
Somehow I don't think they phrased it quite like that.

964
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,200
To quote, as previously mentioned, we unfortunately experienced some last minute technical difficulties

965
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,960
and weren't able to publish the new content as planned.

966
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,160
However, we have been working hard to resolve these issues and are pleased to be able to

967
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,240
let you know that basically they're all live on the UK store.

968
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,880
Yeah, this is specific, by the way, to the UK store.

969
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:42,320
But hey, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue PAL is out, so if you want to play an extended demo,

970
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,320
go for it.

971
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:49,040
I was going to say also in the US, they made some announcements of upcoming stuff, not

972
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,180
necessarily anything coming out right away.

973
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,280
But late April, we're going to be getting the Pixel Junk Monsters Encore, which is an

974
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,520
expansion pack to, of course, Pixel Junk Monsters.

975
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,120
Early May, we're going to be getting Echo Chrome, and in May sometime, Elephunk.

976
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,160
And then late May, or early June, Wipeout HD.

977
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,160
So that's pretty cool.

978
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,040
They had some pretty interesting videos for Wipeout, some of them make a pack or something

979
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,040
that got released.

980
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:22,240
They had some really trippy, kind of like cartoony tracks, I don't know.

981
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:28,560
So definitely check those out if you own Wipeout Pulse on the PSP, it should be on the Playstation

982
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
store.

983
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,680
You can download those.

984
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,880
Okay.

985
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,440
Some other fun stuff, of course...

986
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,560
Hey, guess what?

987
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,400
Bobby said he didn't need to make one creative change to our show, and that is that no more

988
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,400
ferret.

989
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,400
Ferret, no.

990
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,840
The batteries are going to die in that thing.

991
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,560
You know that we've had that thing for as long as we've been doing this show?

992
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,560
It's mascot.

993
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,200
Those batteries are going to die someday.

994
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,880
The ferret is eternal.

995
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,880
No they won't.

996
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,880
You don't understand, Rob.

997
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,320
You can rip them open and put new batteries in, that's how I got those other ones to work.

998
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,840
Why do you have to fucking tell her how to do it?

999
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:08,400
Like seriously, you could smile and nod and say, yes, Rob, the ferret will die.

1000
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,720
But no, you have to say, oh, we can give it a lobotomy.

1001
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,760
There's almost a bald spot now from where I've been pressing it in the same spot.

1002
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,760
That's ferret abuse.

1003
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,960
I'm sorry, are we a video game podcast?

1004
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,040
We're the food and ferret cast.

1005
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,840
But then you had to mention Bobby and it, you know, halted the show.

1006
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:38,080
Anyways, so Grand Theft Auto IV, of course they like to innovate with each new release

1007
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,080
that they're coming out.

1008
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,680
Now this is something very interesting.

1009
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,760
What they're actually going to incorporate into Grand Theft Auto IV is real world music

1010
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,900
downloads, and it's going to be tied in with Amazon.com.

1011
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,920
Now the way this works is in the game, you can actually call an in-game service called

1012
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:59,960
Zit on your mobile phone, and you get text messages with song and artist names, as well

1013
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,880
as an email if you're a member of the Rockstar Social Club.

1014
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:10,600
And then when you download tracks or whatever, they're going to be about 89 cents to 99 cents,

1015
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,720
and they'll actually, of course they're DRM free because they're MP3s, but I guess you

1016
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,860
can download them in-game and you also get them in the real world.

1017
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:29,160
So that's pretty cool that you'll be able to download some music.

1018
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,080
Somebody by the nickname of Beatmania Slot Machine in our chat room says, Orange Ferret

1019
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,080
Fudio.

1020
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,240
Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood this a little bit.

1021
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,340
It's actually, okay, the way this works is the soundtrack for the game, so the music

1022
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:47,760
actually inside the game, not additional music, so if you hear a song you like on the radio

1023
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,400
or something like that, you can dial that service in the game and then get the MP3 sent

1024
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,400
to you.

1025
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,840
I do have to make a comment to Beatmania Slot Machine.

1026
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
What's that?

1027
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,300
It's actually not a slot machine, it's a Pachi slot.

1028
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,520
But we'll get to that later.

1029
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,920
Don't spoil the upcoming news stories.

1030
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,920
Don't spoil them.

1031
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,920
I'm just kidding.

1032
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,760
But I assume since this is an Xbox 360 game and a PS3 game that you'll be able to put

1033
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,640
your own music in there anyways, so that'd be cool.

1034
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,400
Aren't they doing this in real cars, too, or at least I know there's that whole like

1035
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,000
cell phone thing, like isn't there a commercial on TV for like Verizon or something where

1036
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,320
like you hold up your cell phone and it will recognize the song and download it for you

1037
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,320
or something like that?

1038
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,920
Yeah, there's stuff like that out there.

1039
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,520
Of course they want people to have the big red button.

1040
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,520
What is that?

1041
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,520
Staples?

1042
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,720
Is that the chain that has the commercials with the big easy button that you just press

1043
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,240
it and it does things for you?

1044
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,400
Of course retailers want that with your shopping, one button shopping, because how easy is it

1045
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,560
to push a button to get something?

1046
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,240
Because there's that whole mental thing of instant gratification, which is what this

1047
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,920
whole society is about.

1048
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,320
You're not physically taking the money out of your wallet and handing it to somebody

1049
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,320
or your purse or whatever.

1050
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,080
You're not handing it to somebody.

1051
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,300
Therefore it's so much easier to make these stupid impulse buys.

1052
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,320
And I think this whole feature, while it's interesting and kind of cool, I guess, for

1053
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:11,320
a video game is kind of capitalizing on that, because you know there are going to be a lot

1054
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,680
of people that buy this game and there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be

1055
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,160
like, oh, I like this game, click, oh, I just spent a dollar.

1056
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,160
But it's just a dollar.

1057
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,560
That's what I hate about iTunes.

1058
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,400
But I clicked 20 times.

1059
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,080
Well, iTunes is almost the same type of thing.

1060
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,080
That's what I was saying.

1061
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,860
That's what I hate about iTunes, especially since it's on my damn phone.

1062
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:34,280
But at the same time, I like iTunes, but it's a love-hate relationship.

1063
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:40,920
I love iTunes, I love the way it organizes my music and everything, but I do find myself,

1064
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,440
it's far too easy to just go, oh, it's just 99 cents for a song, 300 songs later, oh,

1065
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,440
I'm broke.

1066
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,280
I've gone how many years without buying a damn thing on iTunes until I got my phone?

1067
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,800
And then I probably, I'm still okay, I probably only bought like 25 songs total.

1068
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,840
It's that convenience.

1069
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,840
I'm telling you.

1070
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,840
We're such a lazy society.

1071
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:04,320
I mean, it's not necessarily like, I'm not saying like, oh, you're bad or, you know,

1072
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,320
oh, you're, but it's just kind of where we are.

1073
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,640
I think it's more putting the temptation in there because honestly, and this is how me

1074
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:14,160
personally I am, I believe that the things worth having are worth working for, you know.

1075
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,360
It's like, it's like I'm putting a giant cookie, no, no, I got it.

1076
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,160
I'm putting a giant piece of pastrami in your hands.

1077
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,440
I'm not that big on pastrami.

1078
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,080
I wanted pastrami today.

1079
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,080
So I got pastrami.

1080
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,080
Okay, finally.

1081
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,080
Press button.

1082
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,080
Get pastrami.

1083
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,080
Fine.

1084
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,080
Then I put a big bottle of Goldschlager in your hand.

1085
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,080
I don't like Goldschlager.

1086
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,080
And I say, well, God damn it.

1087
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,080
What is something you like?

1088
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,080
Here's what I want.

1089
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,080
I like sushi.

1090
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,080
Okay.

1091
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,080
Sushi.

1092
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,720
I put a big piece of sushi in your hand and I say, hold on to this for a little bit.

1093
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,900
By the way, if you eat that, you can eat it, but it will cost you a couple bucks.

1094
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,900
And you're going, gulp.

1095
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,280
You're like, oh, it's just a couple bucks, gulp.

1096
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,000
Look, here, hold this piece too.

1097
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,360
It's like hotel rooms at more upscale, I mean, obviously they don't have it at Motel 6, but

1098
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:04,040
the more upscale type motels, they'll have all the candy and shit sitting out right there

1099
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,040
on the table.

1100
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,120
And it's like, hey, if you open it, two bucks.

1101
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,120
What a terrible thing if you brought kids on the trip.

1102
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,120
It's a freaking minibar.

1103
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,120
So you know what I do?

1104
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,120
Mm-hmm.

1105
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,040
I go grocery store down the street and buy me a bottle.

1106
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,040
That's what you got to do.

1107
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,040
All right.

1108
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,040
Sorry.

1109
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,040
Tangent.

1110
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,220
What are we without our tangents?

1111
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,220
That's right.

1112
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:27,400
I was just going to say, I want a service on Xbox Live where I can pay for a pizza with

1113
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,480
Microsoft points.

1114
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,480
Slash pizza?

1115
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,480
Yeah.

1116
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,200
But why shouldn't I be able to get one?

1117
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,200
Wait.

1118
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,400
I bet that type of stuff is only a matter of time away.

1119
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,400
Only a matter of time.

1120
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,760
I want to be able to stop, pause my game for a second, order pizza.

1121
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,060
I guess I could just call up a pizza place and play the game at the same time, but we're

1122
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,020
talking about integration, so why not?

1123
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,860
But once you get sick of pizza, I mean...

1124
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,860
I worked at a pizza place.

1125
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,860
No, I don't get sick of pizza.

1126
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:00,120
This is why I love internet TV, you know, because me and every...

1127
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,040
I've made it perfectly clear, I hate being a slave to my television.

1128
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,880
I hate having to...

1129
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,760
And you know, I don't see any money of paying for a DVR when I can just go online and watch

1130
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,760
whatever.

1131
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,360
You want to hear something that's going to be really bad?

1132
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,280
Wait till Spore comes out and they have that service where you can create your character

1133
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,320
and then get a figurine of it.

1134
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:25,280
Like, oh my god, that looks awesome, figurine, figurine, figurine, and they deliver this

1135
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,720
giant crate of figures for your house.

1136
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:32,260
Nope, I actually would do that, but then again, I also go back and have drawn fan art of my

1137
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,520
PSO character in the past, so...

1138
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,320
I'll do it too, and I like crappy things made by me, that's why.

1139
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:43,200
Hey everybody, pay me 20 bucks and I'll draw your RPG character.

1140
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,000
Did you have another thought you were trying to finish, Jamie, I'm sorry.

1141
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Dot dot dot.

1142
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,120
I love this comment from rawstealut in regards to the pizza being sold on Xbox Live Marketplace,

1143
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,520
but then the pizza would be DRM protected and you'd not be able to eat it if something

1144
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,520
went wrong before it got delivered.

1145
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,520
I remember what I was saying.

1146
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,520
Okay.

1147
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:08,560
What I was saying is that, you know, as long as you have a computer near you, anything

1148
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,200
is convenient, because like I was saying, I don't watch TV, but I'll watch whatever

1149
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:17,760
I can on the internet and do all of my other stuff, and I've ordered stuff through online

1150
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:23,240
services before, you know, like, you know, if we were going to order from, like, say

1151
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,000
if Dan and I wanted pizza, you can order online at some places while I'm doing plenty of other

1152
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
things.

1153
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,360
So, I mean, really, this whole society is about nothing but convenience, and I'm like,

1154
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,440
dude, just go out and get it.

1155
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,440
Better yet.

1156
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,460
You order, like, Pizza Hut or something like that, because they're kind of affiliated with,

1157
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:44,040
I know, I know, I prefer Roundtable, but that's regional, and, you know, Pizza Hut, they did

1158
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,760
the whole affiliation with, you know, Xbox and stuff like that.

1159
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:54,320
So, you order, like, a Pizza Hut pizza, and they have a card from Microsoft Points taped

1160
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,040
to the top of the box, and that'd be cool, like, you know, 500 points or something like

1161
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,520
that.

1162
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,960
That would give me the order more Pizza Hut.

1163
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,960
We'll see.

1164
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,940
RawsteelUT says, why stop at pizza?

1165
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,680
Order sushi, Chinese, and hamburgers.

1166
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,360
Or even better, you order the past day and you get a downloadable content or something

1167
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:16,640
like that for Grand Theft Auto, where you can actually have, you know, your Pizza Hut

1168
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,680
outfit for your character, and you get a pizza in-game.

1169
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,680
That's integration.

1170
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,520
They need to hire us as marketing consultants.

1171
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,560
I want to bring a soundboard with us to all games.

1172
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,560
What do you think?

1173
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,560
You think Bobby would love that?

1174
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,960
If we take a soundboard with us to all games?

1175
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:31,960
That would be fantastic.

1176
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,880
And hey, Geronimo, Papa John's got me through college.

1177
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,200
I think we need an actual soundboard first, you know.

1178
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,200
We'll work on it.

1179
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,560
I just don't want to go crazy with it because, you know, I don't want to go crazy with a

1180
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,720
soundboard, but sometimes it's just too good.

1181
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,720
All right.

1182
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,720
Anyhow, sorry.

1183
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,720
Back to video gaming news.

1184
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,800
Well, actually, I wouldn't say this is gaming news, Morris.

1185
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,200
It is gaming rumor.

1186
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,480
That is big, big rumor.

1187
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,520
Apparently the achievements for Grand Theft Auto IV have hit the internet.

1188
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,640
Two different websites have posted the 50 different achievements that are supposed to

1189
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,500
be in the game.

1190
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,280
Some of the achievements are supposed to include things like hidden packages, doing types of

1191
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,080
stunt jumping, completing certain missions, beating mini games.

1192
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,720
Some of the other features, though, are a little weird.

1193
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,920
Here's some sample achievements.

1194
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,460
Manhunt will get you a 15 gamer score.

1195
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:29,960
Complete the most wanted side missions from the police computer.

1196
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,840
Warm Coffee, successfully date a girl to be invited into her house.

1197
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:42,040
That's true, that's a pretty bold achievement, Warm Coffee.

1198
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,960
Let Sleeping Rockstars Lie, 10 gamer score.

1199
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,480
Kill a rockstar developer in a ranked multiplayer match.

1200
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,480
I can see that.

1201
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,320
There's just been a couple games that have things like that, Kill the Creator or something

1202
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,320
like that.

1203
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,320
That would be sweet.

1204
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,320
I don't know.

1205
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,840
I mean, like, they kind of sound legitimate, but she...

1206
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,840
I think it's legit.

1207
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:07,320
The gamer, you know, the profile that they show the gamer score for is one of the rockstar

1208
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:13,160
internal gamer tags or whatever like that, so I'd buy it.

1209
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:18,040
And it sounds legit, and I think that something by now would be leaked out, and who cares?

1210
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,040
It's just gamer score.

1211
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,880
It's not like it's spoiling the game or anything.

1212
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,880
True.

1213
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,920
Although they had some interesting things in there, like you can play pool, there's

1214
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,440
an arcade game that's built into it, and you can bowl, so...

1215
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,080
I kind of knew a lot of that stuff was coming, though, because Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice

1216
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,080
City had a lot of that.

1217
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,440
I think it's going to be awesome, and when this game comes out, I'll just have to become

1218
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,160
a hermit for a while, so...

1219
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,440
Nice knowing you.

1220
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:50,000
Well, a lot of people have been waiting for the Gran Turismo 5 prologue, but they're going

1221
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,760
to have to wait even longer for the actual thing, because they're saying it's still

1222
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,200
about a year away.

1223
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:03,840
So, if you want any type of Gran Turismo 5 at all, your best bet is to get the glorified

1224
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,360
demo on April 17th.

1225
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,600
My problem with the fact that this game's a year away is, assuming that they're using

1226
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:14,200
the same engine, and I hope to God that they're not by the time we get around to that, it's

1227
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,480
going to be so outdated.

1228
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,680
By that time, you're going to have like, Forza 3, and so many other games that do what they

1229
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,040
do a lot better.

1230
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,840
I don't know, it's just kind of like, not worth it at this point.

1231
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:32,680
Why does it take them so long to model cars when, you know, fucking Project Gotham and

1232
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,840
all these other games, you know, have cars that look good as well, and they're well modeled?

1233
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,160
I don't understand what's taking them so long to get this game done.

1234
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,200
It's like everyone seems to be doing it a lot faster.

1235
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,180
That's a quilt Hippo asks in chat, he says, why the hell do these Gran Turismo games take

1236
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,180
so damn long?

1237
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,080
Does it take that long to sample engine noises?

1238
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,520
I mean, the game looks good, don't get me wrong, but it's just, it's not that much better

1239
01:04:54,520 --> 01:05:00,200
than like, Project Gotham or Forza, I mean, or even there's like Grid coming up that looks

1240
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,360
pretty awesome.

1241
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:06,520
I just, I don't see what, you know, they're putting a lot of time in it, you know, it's

1242
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:11,700
kind of like Duke Nukem Forever type, I mean, not so bad, but, you know, Duke Nukem Forever,

1243
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,000
they're putting all this effort and time into it, and then by the time it comes out, it's

1244
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,480
just going to be kind of, it'll be good, but it won't be like, whoa, awesome, you know,

1245
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:27,320
I just, you know, Gran Turismo 5 I'm sure will be really big for PlayStation, but will

1246
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,200
it really be that big of an achievement?

1247
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,560
I mean, I don't know.

1248
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:37,840
I just don't understand why it's taking them so long for this game when, you know, Microsoft

1249
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:43,240
and other companies can push out these games really quick, is my thing.

1250
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:49,720
Well, it's just kind of, I don't know, I hope it's worth the wait for the fans of the series.

1251
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,640
I really hope it is.

1252
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:58,320
So there's an interesting rumors going around by, about a possible redesign and the newer

1253
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,200
PSP.

1254
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:05,720
Of course, you may remember the original PSP, which is known as the 1000 series, and the

1255
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,280
newer PSP Slim, which is the 2000 series.

1256
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:15,840
Well, apparently there is a third design in the works, and actually as part of an online

1257
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:25,160
document for, you know, PlayStation.net, they actually have an image for the 3000 series.

1258
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:31,680
So apparently it does exist, or it will be coming, so there will be yet maybe another

1259
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,380
redesign to the PlayStation portable console, and I mean, after all, they were talking that

1260
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:44,120
it was going to be a 10 year life cycle for this portable system, so I can see them making

1261
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:48,120
some more revisions, but I think it's kind of interesting.

1262
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,120
Kind of sucks for people that bought, you know, the Slim and the original and stuff

1263
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,120
like that.

1264
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,120
Now they have to buy a third one.

1265
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,840
Seriously, this news alone is making me contemplate not getting, because I was thinking about

1266
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,260
getting the Slim just because I wanted the video out, and you know, my PSP is getting

1267
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,640
kind of old, and I kind of wanted to get a newer one.

1268
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:07,120
They're coming down a lot in price, but now that I'm like, oh, there's another one that's

1269
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,760
going to come out, I'm kind of like, well, maybe I ought to wait.

1270
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,360
Remember some other company that did the exact same thing, the Gizmondo?

1271
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,240
Remember how they're like, hey, you know what, we're going to have this system.

1272
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,760
Oh, by the way, it hasn't released yet, but we're already doing a revision on it, and

1273
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,520
you're like, eh, I'm just going to wait until the new one comes out, and then no one bought

1274
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,520
it.

1275
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,360
But, you know, I've got to wonder, like, you know, Nintendo kind of does the same thing.

1276
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:34,680
Yes, but at the same time, I mean, here's the only difference between, I think, the

1277
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,000
DS Lite and the PSP.

1278
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,800
The PSP Slim, it limits you to what options you have available for you when you're playing

1279
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,800
it.

1280
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:49,280
Like, there's certain, you know, applications that you cannot use on, you know, the fatter

1281
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:54,760
PSP, and also, the newer PSPs have more RAM and other stuff like that, whereas the DS

1282
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,760
...

1283
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,760
And shorter battery life.

1284
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,280
No, the battery life is just the same, and actually, I think a little bit more improved,

1285
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,720
but the fact is that...

1286
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,360
Well, your friend's wrong.

1287
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:11,120
Anyway, so they have, you know, the DS Lite, it basically is a bit slimmer and has, you

1288
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,320
know, a brighter screen, but that's about it.

1289
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:21,240
I mean, most things that run on the DS Lite will also run on the original DS as well.

1290
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,800
There's not anything that says, okay, you have to have this, you know, version of the

1291
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,960
hardware in order to be able to play this.

1292
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:28,960
That's my only thing.

1293
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,400
You know, there were three different versions of the Game Boy Advance.

1294
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,440
There was that first one that wasn't backlit, there was the second one that came out that

1295
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,840
was backlit, and then there was the real miniature one that could go on, like, your keychain.

1296
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,840
So...

1297
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,840
I have a micro.

1298
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,720
Yeah, the Game Boy Advance, the SP, and the micro.

1299
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,720
That's it.

1300
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,720
The SP was ill, and then the micro, yeah.

1301
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,320
The micro got me through many a line in E3.

1302
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,960
The micro was such a waste of time.

1303
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,360
But the micro didn't do very well overall, you know.

1304
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,360
No, but I love it.

1305
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,280
The only problem it sucked for is playing...

1306
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,280
RPGs or anything with text?

1307
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,520
Well, no, even text wasn't so bad.

1308
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:07,520
It was playing any type of shooter.

1309
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,520
I don't know.

1310
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,360
I think it's, I guess it's, you know, inevitable that they're going to need to update the system

1311
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:16,520
since you're not going to just come out with a PSP2 yet.

1312
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,460
But I don't know, that kind of still sucks for someone that just bought the system.

1313
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,460
But...

1314
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,080
You should be used to it by now.

1315
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:28,520
I'm sure this PSP 3000 will be unhackable, completely unhackable in any way.

1316
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:35,840
All right, well let's move on to another Sony related story, and that has to do with a much

1317
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,080
anticipated title, Metal Gear Solid 4.

1318
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:46,080
The pre-order DVDs are shipping, and they come with that Metal Gear Online beta keys,

1319
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:50,560
and it does announce that the beta is going to begin on April 21st.

1320
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,720
You can download the Metal Gear Online beta on April 17th, so I guess they're giving a

1321
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,680
little bit of time so that maybe the servers don't all get hammered at once, which probably

1322
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,960
isn't a bad idea.

1323
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:05,500
May 5th is when the beta runs until, so that actually isn't a whole lot of time, but...

1324
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:10,240
I forgot, I downloaded, well I haven't quite downloaded it yet, but I'm in the Battlefield

1325
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:16,000
Bad Company beta, which I hear wasn't very good, but I still haven't got a chance to

1326
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
play it yet.

1327
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Hopefully next week I'll be able to talk about it a little bit, but that was another one

1328
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
that was interesting.

1329
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,400
I'll be very curious to hear from some of our listeners who are in on this.

1330
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:31,000
I haven't ordered this because I don't really follow Metal Gear Online quite rapidly, but

1331
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,360
I'd be really curious to hear from some of our fans on how this goes, how the online

1332
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,080
beta is.

1333
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:40,200
I'm sure there will be plenty of YouTubes and all that stuff, but I like to hear the

1334
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,160
first-hand experiences.

1335
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:51,200
Well, for our listeners in Europe, there actually may be an 80GB PlayStation 3 out by this summer.

1336
01:10:51,200 --> 01:11:00,880
Right now there's only the 40GB version, but there is a little bit of talk going around

1337
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,560
that indicates there is going to be an 80GB model coming out.

1338
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:13,080
So far Sony isn't really doing a good job at saying no about it, so maybe it is.

1339
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,620
And there's actually no comment if it's going to even be backwards compatible or anything

1340
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,620
else good.

1341
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:21,620
I'm going to guess and say it probably will be as backwards compatible as the 80s over

1342
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,180
here.

1343
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,400
Now my question for Europe is, do you want it?

1344
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,600
I mean, do you really want it?

1345
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,880
Here would be my thing for Europe, okay?

1346
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:37,040
They just announced that they're going to release the 80GB system there, and they're

1347
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,640
kind of doing a new one for us with the Metal Gear Solid bundle, and I know the same thing

1348
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:47,080
in Japan, but if you just wait a few more months, I will bet you anything in the fall

1349
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:52,520
they will announce yet another SKU, so just like we were talking about before with the

1350
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:57,580
PSP and stuff, just wait a little longer, because unless there's something you really

1351
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:01,360
need to play right away, you can probably wait a few more months for the better games

1352
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:06,200
to be coming out towards the falls, and by that time you can get probably a newer system

1353
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:14,660
with better features for either the same price or less, so that would be my recommendation.

1354
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:20,720
Another game you should definitely wait on buying is Eye of Judgment, and actually the

1355
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:26,720
Eye of Judgment expansion has been having some delays coming to retail, and the reason

1356
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:36,360
for this, Sony says, is transportation issues, so they were having some problem, I guess,

1357
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:41,400
getting it from Wizards of the Coast to retailers.

1358
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,800
Hear that, or someone hijacked the trucks?

1359
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,800
Was that you?

1360
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,780
Were you trying to get sales to not go up?

1361
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,400
That wasn't me at all.

1362
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:58,280
Actually it was, according to them, was it, the North American delay can be blamed on

1363
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:05,720
transportation delays from European distributors of Eye of Judgment Byleth Rebellion 2 trading

1364
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:12,280
cards, and they have yet to set a new launch date for the software and cards, but plan

1365
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:16,400
to do so in the near future.

1366
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,760
That's okay, everyone can buy the expansion because there's not a lot of people that own

1367
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,760
the game.

1368
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,160
I wonder if anyone at Wizards of the Coast has heard of the Loki bet.

1369
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,480
Does anyone really care?

1370
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,440
Sadly, yes, a lot of our listeners seem to care.

1371
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,440
Well, they care.

1372
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,440
I don't know what it is.

1373
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,640
But Wizards of the Coast couldn't give a rat's ass.

1374
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,720
Probably not.

1375
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,040
Let's see.

1376
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:44,240
Eye of Judgment plus Let's Ride Friends Forever equals Tingle, Cheeseburger's reminder that

1377
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,280
we also get to count the sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever in the deck.

1378
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,000
Yeah, all five of those.

1379
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,040
All right, anyhow, one more story for you guys this segment before we get into the classic

1380
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,040
game of the week.

1381
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,200
And those of you guys that remember the good old days of OLR, you can appreciate this.

1382
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,880
It's something that was alluded to a little bit earlier.

1383
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:08,120
There is now a Pochi slot machine, which really kind of looks like a slot machine to me.

1384
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,200
And oh, I was going to play the video for you guys, but it just got the SmackDown taken

1385
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,200
off of YouTube.

1386
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,200
I've got another one.

1387
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,080
That's all right, don't worry about it.

1388
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,000
Video doesn't do very good over the radio anyway.

1389
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,600
But basically what happens, and I watched it earlier, it looked like a slot machine

1390
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,480
to me, like one of those more like video slot machines you'd see in the casinos.

1391
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,800
Basically with the slots coming down, when certain symbols come up, you play like a Beat

1392
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:37,600
Mania bonus game, and you use the buttons on the thing to control Beat Mania.

1393
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,600
And you know what?

1394
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,320
Here's something else that's kind of cool.

1395
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,240
That's not the only game that's gotten a slot version as well.

1396
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,240
Well, what else?

1397
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,240
Ridge Racer!

1398
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,920
Yeah, that was also on Kotaku this week.

1399
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,800
Did you get to control that?

1400
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,800
I don't know.

1401
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:01,360
But they should have like, you know, Kran eating Ken come out and yell, Ridge Racer!

1402
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,040
There's also an Evangelion one.

1403
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:08,880
Well, there are 11 different songs on 3 different difficulties, Easy, Medium, and Hard.

1404
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,840
So it's certainly not as comprehensive as a new Beat Mania 2DX mix, but nevertheless

1405
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:19,360
it is kind of interesting to see the world of Beat Mania and slot machines combined.

1406
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:23,760
There's also a Parodius Apache slot that I think I've talked about before.

1407
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,600
You ever play like slot machines that they have?

1408
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,000
Because you don't really gamble, do you?

1409
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
You don't really play slot machines.

1410
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,880
I used to play that Fox Hunt one.

1411
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,880
Fox Hunt?

1412
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,460
That was at the place.

1413
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:37,800
When I was in Reno last, the one I played a lot of was called the Frog Prince.

1414
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,200
You know, and it's basically one where the bonus level is that you kiss different frogs

1415
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,480
and you try to find the one that becomes a prince?

1416
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,720
It was the dumbest game, but it was for some reason making me a lot of money that night.

1417
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:53,760
Well, I was playing pennies, so it was making me a few dollars, which is a lot in pennies,

1418
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,160
so that's why I stuck with it.

1419
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:59,400
But I bring up slot machines and all that, because you know Konami makes a lot of slot

1420
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,400
machines.

1421
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,240
Even the ones you see over here, they make quite a few of those slot machines.

1422
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,160
It's like another business of theirs we never really talk about.

1423
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:09,040
So I see many of their franchises go into those slot machines and Apache slots.

1424
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:14,720
I mean, honestly.

1425
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,240
So how about we get into the Classic Game of the Week?

1426
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,240
That sounds like a plan.

1427
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,480
All right, you know what we do here at Orange Launch Radio at the end of Part A when our

1428
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,880
show is winding down here?

1429
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:30,560
We like to pay tribute and respect to gaming's classics, and DarkSakura likes to look through

1430
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,780
her archive of games and pick a classic one for you every week.

1431
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:37,840
We call it DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1432
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,880
What classic game should the kids be playing this week, DarkSakura?

1433
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,920
Well, this is actually one of my favorite RPGs ever, except honestly it's actually one

1434
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:51,320
of the few that I've played quite a bit through in Japanese, until I had a little problem

1435
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,320
playing through it.

1436
01:16:53,320 --> 01:17:01,400
The game is Grandia, which is one of the pinnacle, I would say, of Sega Saturn role-playing for

1437
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,320
their RPG series.

1438
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:13,640
So it did have quite a few sequels, one of them notably being Grandia 2 that was on Dreamcast

1439
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:18,880
that I remember bringing up on the show years ago, because I thought it was cool that my

1440
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:23,880
Japanese save file worked on the US version, because I put it in and I was like, where

1441
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,880
am I?

1442
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,960
I don't know what anybody's talking about.

1443
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:38,760
So anyway, Grandia has 3D maps with 2D sprite characters, think like Ragnarok I guess, but

1444
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:44,280
it rotates with your movement, it's from an angled third person perspective, and so it'll

1445
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,280
follow with you.

1446
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,960
Just a word of warning, the camera works so much better in the Saturn one, you also get

1447
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:55,400
much more of the playfield open than you do with the Playstation one, which is, actually

1448
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:00,800
the 3D looks better in the Saturn one, which is completely baffling to me, since the Saturn

1449
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,560
didn't have that tremendous of a 3D processor.

1450
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,640
You also have a compass to show you where you go, you get treasure chests inside.

1451
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:17,320
A fun story to it too, you also have skill points that you need to learn your abilities,

1452
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:22,360
and you have a rotational roster for your characters, you can pick different ones to

1453
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:27,880
have in, there are different types of weapons and classes, like swords, maces, whips, that

1454
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:34,120
sort of thing, and you actually learn your magic as you go through the game, by recovering

1455
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:38,000
these mana eggs, it's pretty cool.

1456
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,440
The combat system though is what I like best, Rob, you played Evolution, didn't you?

1457
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,440
No.

1458
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:50,280
I thought you did, well, Evolution is another game art title, but the way that the combat

1459
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:55,560
works in here is that it's on, well you can, it's like in Chrono Trigger, you can see the

1460
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:01,280
enemies on the screen, if they see you, they'll rush towards you, or you can try to avoid

1461
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:07,520
them and they'll run into you, but then when you're in combat it goes overhead, and it

1462
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:16,720
has, I look at it more of as initiative based, like if you were playing D&D or something,

1463
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:22,240
then everybody has their own sort of speed that their initiative moves at, so you'll

1464
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:27,000
have your slower characters taking longer, your faster ones being faster, and you choose

1465
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,360
your attacks as you're going through, and then when that turn comes up, they'll hit

1466
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,760
and then the enemy will go back and forth, it's pretty, I have to say it's fairly more

1467
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,520
realistic than the turn based style for Final Fantasy games, if you know what I mean.

1468
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,200
And Rob, you're watching it, what do you think?

1469
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,920
It looks very interesting, I've always heard a lot about this game, it's just one of those

1470
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,200
games I just never got around to playing, because there were a lot of games, especially

1471
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:55,400
this was the period when I was in college, so I didn't play a lot of games, that was

1472
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,600
kind of the one time in my life when I wasn't as into video games as I was the rest of it,

1473
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:04,200
but it looks like a lot of fun, and I want to say, a sequel of Grandia's is available

1474
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,040
on GameTap, I want to say, I want to say like Grandia 2, is it on there?

1475
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,080
Well, Grandia 2 was a good one, then there was a Grandia 3 and I think a Grandia Extreme,

1476
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:17,360
which I haven't played the latter ones, but nothing to me, I mean, Grandia is probably

1477
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,040
up there in my list, this would actually, I even like this better than Final Fantasy

1478
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:26,240
7, and Final Fantasy 6, if that's an indication of how much I like it.

1479
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:31,240
The way I got my Saturn version was very fun, because at the time I got my Saturn version

1480
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:35,700
they were going for about 80 to 100 bucks a piece, I bought one for 15 that said the

1481
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:40,080
discs were damaged, so I was like, I'll just rip them and re-burn them, right?

1482
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:45,040
So this is at Anime Expo, probably the last year I went, and I was going in to watch the

1483
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,200
Utena movie, and I ended up just sitting out in the hall waiting for it to be over, and

1484
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:55,880
as I sat and tried to clean the discs, I realized that the discs weren't scratched, they actually

1485
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:04,680
had stuff on them, so I cleaned off the discs, it looked like hot glue, and cleaned it all

1486
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:08,680
off and lo and behold, I had perfect copies for 15 bucks.

1487
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:09,680
Nice.

1488
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:14,360
Like I said, this did have a Playstation release that is not nearly as good, however, the only

1489
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:20,360
way you can play it in English is on Playstation, and I warn you, it is highly, highly censored,

1490
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:24,200
especially the part where they go in the bar.

1491
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:29,680
So it's really, really good, I say give it a try.

1492
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:34,560
Alright, your classic game of the week boys and girls, Grandia, which is a series I know

1493
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,680
a lot of people really have a lot of love for, so I'm sure that's going to be a, that's

1494
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,360
not going to be disputed by many as a classic game.

1495
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:47,200
Oh, real quick though, I do have the series, it was Grandia 2 and Grandia 3, and then the

1496
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,460
spinoffs were Grandia Digital Museum, which is basically like a bunch of artwork and voice

1497
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:56,440
files and stuff that went with it, Grandia Parallel Trippers, and Grandia Extreme, and

1498
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,280
Grandia Online, which I'm going to play Grandia Online.

1499
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,280
Sounds like fun.

1500
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:06,520
