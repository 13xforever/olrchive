Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Mojo.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, March 9th, 2008, is Smash Bros malfunctioning on some Wii's?

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
More car and track information is released for Gran Turismo 5.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Spore gets a port to an unlikely gaming platform.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and, wait for it, the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Hi.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
And how are you, Miss Summers?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Meaty.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Meaty? Mmm, so meaty.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
What exactly are you eating tonight?

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm eating a protein-style cheeseburger from In-N-Out.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Mmm, yum.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
This isn't my mic.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah, I think you have Loki's. That's alright.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hey.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
You know, the technical difficulties just couldn't end with last week.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I feel better.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Alright, there you go. You feel complete now?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I do.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, well let me introduce Tech Master Loki real quick and then we'll talk about last week.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, now with proper mic.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes, I have the proper mic.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
How are you, Loki?

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Good. I'm just untangling the mic on the mixing board so I don't pull it and it turns all the knobs on there.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
I know. We have to be like ultra, like, make sure everything is in its proper place tonight after last week.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Alright, so yeah, I'm sure you guys all heard the epilogue at the end of last week's Part A.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Those of you guys that were listening on the podcast anyway, those of you guys that are live tonight, Sunday,

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
joining us in our chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com, nothing happened for you.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
You guys heard the show as always, but unfortunately the folks who listened to us on the podcast,

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
they didn't get Part B last week because right after it was done and we were in our final segment,

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
the computer got unplugged, I made a boo-boo and zapped the temp file so we couldn't really save it.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Now, what's kind of cool though is that one of our listeners, this is J100Matt,

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
actually was able to retrieve the audio directly out of the Justin TV cam, but the quality kind of stinks

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
because it's all based off the iSight cam that we use for Justin TV, which is a completely different computer.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
It's actually a laptop, and you can't really hear Jamie at all because Jamie, well, I mean you can,

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
but she's just really quiet because she's the furthest away from it, and yeah, I don't know.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
That may be a positive or a minus depending.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Jamie, rebuttal.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
No.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
All right.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Loki gets smacked with a large trout or whatever the old MIRC thing is.

02:41.000 --> 02:50.000
Anyhow, so yeah, we'll release the kind of cruddy audio part B like on our Facebook and MySpace and all that stuff.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
I'll try to get that up tomorrow just for those folks that really want to hear it,

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
but for the rest of you guys, it's just another broken show, what can we say?

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
But we're hoping tonight is working.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
We're back to our normal selves.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
It's a new month.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
The weather's getting warmer again.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
We're off to a good start because the network is actually working the way it's supposed to.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
We didn't have to jerry-rig a whole second network setup,

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
so we're hoping we are ready to talk games for our full part A and part B tonight,

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
so I will shut up and turn it over to DarkSakura who will talk about her gaming week.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
My gaming week was almost nonexistent except for, of course, Ragnarok

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
because I've been very busy trying to get a few things ready and had a few hang-ups come in the way,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
but I think I'm going to actually be able to play more stuff next week.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
That's good. Sometimes real life gets in the way of gaming. That's okay.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Sometimes people can't hold the controller.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Gotcha.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Well then, Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It was okay.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
I played Orange Box on the PC because I have had it for a while and I haven't actually tried it.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
It looks nice on the PC, but it's exactly the same.

04:04.000 --> 04:16.000
So, yeah. Mainly Portal, because that's actually all I got, so it's just Portal.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
And then I've been playing a little bit of Smash Bros. Brawl.

04:21.000 --> 04:30.000
I'm 30% way through the subspace emissary, so that's pretty fun.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
And then, what else? I think I may have played some Patapon. That's about it.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Tell me a little bit more about Patapon because I was reading some stuff about it

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
and it actually sounds like something I kind of want to play. Sounds kind of cool.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
It's kind of neat. It's basically, I mean, sort of, it's not really a rhythm music game,

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
but you have to keep rhythm with these drums and depending on what four-note sequence you play,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
they will do different things.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
Like if you have an attack sequence, you have march forward, retreat, that kind of stuff.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
So you just kind of strategize with that and keep in time at the same time.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
The other thing that I did wasn't really playing games, but I got to view a lot of games

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
and that was we had our Eidos rep come out and talk to us a bit about the stuff that they covered

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
during Destination PlayStation.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
And we got to see some really cool stuff including an unreleased trailer for Tomb Raider Legends,

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
or not Tomb Raider Legends, Tomb Raider Underworld with gameplay footage on it and it looks awesome.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Absolutely awesome. They did some new motion capturing for everything.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
Really? Because, pardon my skepticism, but I have failed to get excited about Tomb Raider in about ten years.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
It's about as awesome as Uncharted, maybe.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
I don't know. I'm not that excited about Uncharted, but it really does look good.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
I can't get excited about Tomb Raider because it's just not my thing, but it looks good.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
I don't know. I wouldn't buy it though, but it looks good for people who like Tomb Raider.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Not me. I don't like Tomb Raider.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
I like throwing her off a cliff and killing her and that's about it.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
But I'm sure you can do that and it will look much nicer.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
So that's it.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
Other cool stuff I saw. There's a game. I hope I get the title right.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
I think it's called Little Ninjas and it looks really cool.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
It's kind of a cross between almost like Okami and...

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
I don't really know what else. Maybe Pirates vs. Ninjas or something like that.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Volleyball or Dodgeball or whatever.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Very cute little ninjas and they're fighting bad guys and stuff like that.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
All kind of cel-shaded. It looks really neat.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
So that will be coming out next year, unfortunately.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
And then I got to see some gameplay of the new Death Junior that they're doing for the Wii.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
It actually looks pretty good.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Hopefully it won't suck like the rest of them, but I'm pretty confident.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And then the one I was kind of excited about for the...

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Wait, I have a quick question. I thought Death Junior was a Konami license.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Why is Eidos doing it now?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Different publisher. It's the company owned...

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh, gotcha. Sorry. Yeah, that's right. Konami just published someone else's game.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
I wonder why they decided not to do this one.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
I don't know. Maybe the last two sucked for them and they dropped the publisher and Eidos picked them up. Who knows.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
I also got to see some pretty cool footage of Gauntlet for the DS.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
That's going to be cool. I wish they'd put it on live.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
But it's like a cross between the original Gauntlet and Gauntlet Legends.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
It's still top-down like the original Gauntlet, but it's all 3D and stuff like Legends was.

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
The cool thing about it though, four-player Wi-Fi co-op and there's voice chat involved with that as well.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
So at least they're doing that right. So that'll be a pretty good purchase.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
I've got to catch up on some comments from Chat Room because we have lots of good stuff tonight.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
chat.orangelaunchrader.com if you want to join us.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
DKJunior92 says, Uncharted is way better than Tomb Raider and you can kill him.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
DMN says, Gauntlet DS equals sex. I will make love to it.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
GS68 says, too many gaming publications credit the publisher and not the developer.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
And you're right. I just made the same mistake. I'm sorry.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
It's okay. Then there's some other cool stuff I wasn't aware of like the series and stuff like Shell Shock 2 they showed us.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Which I guess that's like a survivor horror game set in NOM. It's like Condemned in NOM, I guess.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
And then there's this other Looney Tunes game that was a complete rip-off of Elite Beat Agents.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
I mean, completely a rip-off of Elite Beat Agents. Except I don't know about the music though.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
The music is like out of Looney Tunes so it's all that orchestrated stuff.

08:48.000 --> 09:00.000
Not necessarily that but I think it did look kind of hard but it's exactly like Elite Beat Agents.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
I mean, if you play Elite Beat Agents this will be easy for you.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
So that's pretty much it. That was my gaming week. It was kind of exciting though to get to see everything.

09:09.000 --> 09:18.000
And I got to talk to her but she offered us, well at least me and my co-worker, to go tour Eidos.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Let's see if I can drag other people on.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Aren't they going to make you sign all kinds of papers where you can't talk about it here though?

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
No, they're just like... She was talking about, for example, showing us storyboards for Tomb Raider and stuff like that.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
That's cool.

09:32.000 --> 09:40.000
I don't know. All the stuff was pretty much announced. Obviously I don't have the trailer for Tomb Raider Underworld or anything like that.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
That's the stuff that wasn't shown. I mean, kind of shown behind closed doors type thing.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
I don't know. It looks pretty good. I don't know. Just Cause 2 looks exciting.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
But I like the first one so I'm looking forward to those Grand Theft Auto type of games.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Alright. Sounds like there's a lot coming out for you.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
Good fourth quarter for them. That's pretty good because Eidos in the past has been a few games.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Been a little bit iffy.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
It's been a rough ride.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
It's been a rough ride?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Well good. I'm glad to see them getting back on track.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
Hey Jamie, I got a question for you because I know you're a fan of Elite Beat Agents, right?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
What do you think about the whole Looney Tunes franchise completely knocking it off?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I think it's stupid.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
You think it's stupid? Too much of a good thing?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Well...

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
It's a copy of a copy?

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Yeah. I think that if they were going to do something it would be better for them to do something original.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
But who knows? I mean obviously it can't be just a straight up rip off, right Loki?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's got to have some original stuff in it.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
Basically what it does is it recreates the different cartoons. Like very famous cartoon scenes or whatever.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And so you're playing the music though with the cartoon.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
That's kind of cool.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Oh okay. That might actually be kind of neat.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
I mean if you've got like the whole thing going on there where the cartoon's going on.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
Because Elite Beat Agents is kind of like that in a way, but it's different.

10:58.000 --> 11:06.000
It just kind of controls exactly the same. Like if you looked at the interface and how the different spots where you tap and stuff, it looks exactly the same.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
And who knows? I haven't looked at the developer. Maybe it's the same developer. You never know.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Well GS68 in our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com, sums it up.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Looney Tunes Oh and Don, do not want...

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
That's what a GS68 says in our chat.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Going on to my gaming week, I've been playing lots of World of Warcraft.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Because I'm addicted.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And our guild has been just tearing the shit out of Karazhan.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Which is our new thing is that we've been raiding Karazhan.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Trying to slowly clear our way through it.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
And I think we're doing pretty well for a group of noobs.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I think we've cleared like seven of the bosses.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
So we're almost there.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
Also in other gaming news, of course, I also played the hell out of Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
When did we get that? Wednesday?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
So we were lucky enough to get it a couple days early.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And was playing it a little bit on Justin.tv.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
So those of you guys that keep an eye on what we're doing.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Got a little sneak peek on Wednesday.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
And goddamn, I'm having a lot of fun with Super Smash.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
But now that I can actually understand it, as opposed to the Japanese version, like what's going on.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I'm having a lot of fun.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
What I do think is interesting is that whole subspace emissary mode.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Obviously I don't want to spoil a whole lot of what's going on.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
But I think what's interesting is that the cutscenes use no dialogue whatsoever.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
There's no dialogue whatsoever in the cutscenes.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Everything is more of an emotional reaction.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
There's no words.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Which is very interesting.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
The whole story is kind of told with the music.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. It's just interesting.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
It's a cost saving thing.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
It is totally a cost saving thing.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
So they don't have to pay voice actors and they don't have to pay other voice actors to translate what they're saying.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
I gotta say though, I am pretty freaking impressed that it has a pretty fairly fleshed out single player mode.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Melee had its own kind of single player mode that was kind of cool.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
And certainly I remember when I played that first world in the single player mode, the Mushroom Kingdom thing,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I was like, they need to do a Mario game just like this on the GameCube.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And of course they never did.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Well, I don't know, Paper Mario on the Wii is kind of rad like that, but I don't know.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
But just seeing what they did with the single player mode here and really making it a game.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
It's not like the greatest single player game ever.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
And you sort of have to really suspend disbelief to make the story work.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Because they really did kind of have to put all these characters in a blender and kind of pull a story out of their butts.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
But it works.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
It does the fanboy service and that's really what this game is all about.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
And I'll tell you what, it's very comprehensive fanboy service.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Because not only do you have all these characters, you have all the stickers.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
Which, I mean, I think I got a sticker today for Mouser, one of the bosses in Super Mario 2.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I mean, there's some obscure shit in those things.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Like, I was getting things from Advance Wars I never even heard of because I didn't play a lot of that series.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
It's just Nintendo fanboy wet dream, this game is.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
And you know what, even if you're not like a Super Nintendo fanboy, it's a great party game.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Which, duh, it's a Wii game.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And the Wii has a lot of great party games and this is no exception.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Because I was playing a little bit, three players the other night.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Which is funny because one of us was on the Wii with Nunchuck.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
One of us was on the Wii with Classic Controller and the other one was using a GameCube controller.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
So it's kind of fun.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Online mode I haven't gotten to test a whole lot.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Because obviously nobody had it on Wednesday, which is when I did most of my playing.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
I tried to add one of our other folks here on Orange Launch Radio who also had the game.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
But it wasn't working, I don't know why.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Maybe it wasn't, maybe it wasn't up and running, I don't know.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
But I will, I want to point out that we have a friend code thread over on our forums.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I'm going to add everybody on there later today.

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
And try to maybe bring out Justin.tv this evening and try to fight some folks, Orange Launch Radio listeners.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Yes, and we can use my map if I can swap it with somebody.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Because, you know, I made a cool map.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It's called the Cage Match.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Nice, I see what you did there.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
Alright, let's see, what else do I want to talk about in my gaming week?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Really quickly, I want to mention Trigger Heart Excellica.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Because I think a lot of people totally skipped this game.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Because it was an Xbox Live Arcade release.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
But I'll tell you what, if you like your Japanese shooters, this is as cliche of a Japanese shooter as they come.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I mean, this is, which is a good thing for the Xbox 360.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
Because, you know, I think about, hmm, what good like Japanese influenced shooter games are there on the Xbox 360?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And you know what, I come up short.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
So Trigger Heart Excellica certainly fills a void.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
It's actually based off a arcade game, which I hadn't heard of.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Because I don't play a lot of games in these types of series.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I had it on soundtrack, so I knew it existed.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
But it's fun.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I mean, bullets everywhere.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I mean, like your typical Japanese shooter.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Bullets everywhere.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
You play a lot of Japanese shooters?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Dark Sakura?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Do you play one?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
I did.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Have you ever heard of this one, Trigger Heart Excellica?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Yes.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, it's good times.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
If you like that, I was going to say in April there's Castle of Shikigami 3 is coming out in the Wii.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
So, that would be another good one.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I think it's definitely worth a look, Trigger Heart Excellica.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
I did not spend the money on the full purchase, but I might later on.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
Now I'm kind of at the point with Xbox 360 arcade games where like either I'm going to buy the damn thing when it comes right out.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm not going to buy it.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
Or I'm going to wait for them to do a price reduction because now they've shown that they're willing to do that later.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I bought a bunch of tracks on Rock Band this week.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I'm like, what?

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
Because I, well, I bought a bunch of the older stuff because I wanted some other...

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
I left it in my work now, and we have it all set up there so we can play at any time.

16:17.000 --> 16:27.000
I'm actually buying the official, like, well someone made them their official drum silencer thing so the drums aren't so loud.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
I tried making my own out of mouse pads.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
The funny thing about mouse pads is they soak up super glue pretty easy so it doesn't stick very well.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
So, I'm ripping those off and then trying these official ones out.

16:43.000 --> 16:52.000
Because while they stuck, they were working pretty good, but it's just, you know, after you hit them about 20 times, they fell right off.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh well.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Alright.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my gaming week that I want to talk about.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I don't think there is.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I think that's really it.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Obviously Smash Brothers took a large chunk of my time.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
As I'm sure for many of you out there who own a Wii, it's taking up a lot of your time as well.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
I love the demos that they have for the virtual console games.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
I'd laugh though because I was just, you know, they show you how long the demo is for each one.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Ice Climbers, 40 seconds.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
That's all you get to play of Ice Climbers is 40 seconds.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
But you can do a lot in 40 seconds in Ice Climbers.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
40 seconds is long enough to beat the first level.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I thought the demos were a nice touch.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I was kind of hoping you would unlock more.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
I don't know if you do yet.

17:33.000 --> 17:33.000
I do.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Do you?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Yeah.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Oh, I haven't seen, because one of my friends marathoned it last night.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I haven't seen if he unlocked anything else.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I imagine you have to unlock a couple others.

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
I have to look at my Japanese one too because I've got, I think, Mother 2 or Mother 3.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Not Mother 3, but Mother 2 I think is still on there.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Huh.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
That may be cool because that means we might have Earthbound on ours.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
No.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Damn it.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
That was exclusive for Japan.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Alright.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Well then we should get something exclusive.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
That's not fair.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Nintendo.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Alright.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
That's, I mean...

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Metal Gear Solid.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
It's kind of shown though that they can't, I mean, they can do a virtual console demo.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Time limited, but it works, right?

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah, they're just assholes, that's all.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Alright.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Anyhow, let's see.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Let's get to tonight's housekeeping before we get to tonight's news.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
And I guess I already said the one thing I wanted to say on housekeeping tonight.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
We do have a friend code thread going on on the forums at orangelaunchradio.com.

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
So we will be having some OL Army tournaments and things like that because, you know, lots of people love Smash Brothers.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
I know lots of our listeners are into this series.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I'm sure tons of you have picked up the game.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
So check it out at orangelaunchradio.com.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Click on the forums.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
And you can probably get 64 friend codes all on that list.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
And make sure if you are adding people on Brawl that you're also adding them on your system.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Just in case we want to swap levels around.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Because as far as I'm aware, I'm not sure if...

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
You can drop them onto, you know, the SD memory cards.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
But I don't know if those things are linked to a certain system or not because Nintendo is an asshole.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
So, you know, they really don't want, you know, anything to work correctly.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
So, you know, in a perfect world you should be able to drop it onto an SD memory card and throw it up on the internet and people can download it and that kind of crap.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
But something tells me it won't work that way.

19:16.000 --> 19:23.000
Because they're afraid that someone is going to make a penis out of blocks or something in fucking Smash Brothers.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
We'll save that for later this week.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Alright.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
DMN wants me to plug something he's doing too which is the OLR March Madness.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
We'll be talking more about that during the live only bonus segment tonight.

19:35.000 --> 19:43.000
But if you want to participate in choosing the best video game of all time, as chosen by our listeners, check out our forums as well in the STFU forum.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
That's DMN's show and there's more information on how you can send your votes in and all that good stuff.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
So, are we ready to get into some gaming news?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Why not?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Alright, I think so.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Why don't you start us off, Logie?

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
Alright, this isn't a big surprise because the same thing happened in Japan when Smash Brothers was released there.

19:59.000 --> 20:11.000
Some Wii systems are having trouble reading Smash Brothers Brawl because, first off, it's the first dual layer Wii game on the system.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
And there was an update, I believe, on the disc to update your system to be able to play those dual layer discs.

20:18.000 --> 20:28.000
And because of that, it takes a little bit more refined laser to see the data on the disc.

20:28.000 --> 20:35.000
And they're claiming that some of the Wii systems are kind of dusty and dirty, so they will not be able to play Brawl.

20:35.000 --> 20:45.000
So if you run into that problem, you're supposed to send your system in to Nintendo and they will fix the problem or clean your disc dry or something like that.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Vacuum out the insides of your Wii or something?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Something to that effect.

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
Do you think there might be any, I mean, you're the type of, you know, you're a homebrew kind of guy, do you think there's any home remedies that someone could try that...

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
I mean, obviously, you know, don't void your warranty or whatever.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
But if somebody out there happens to be getting this problem, is there anything they could try that wouldn't damage their Wii?

21:04.000 --> 21:11.000
It'd be hard because that disc drive's kind of funky. Maybe like a CD cleaner or something like that, or DVD cleaner.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
How effective are those CD cleaner things?

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
I don't think they're very effective. It's just basically a CD with brushes on it, I mean.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
No, no, I was just thinking, does the Wii even play CDs? It doesn't, does it?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
No.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
I don't know. I don't know why I was thinking that. I'm just kind of like, I don't think it plays CDs at all.

21:26.000 --> 21:35.000
Well, I don't know. My system wasn't dusty at all, and I mean, to be honest, there isn't really a lot of places for it to get dusty.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
I mean, that drive isn't really open that much, and there's just, there's, you know, kind of some sort of, like, brushes on it.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah, there's little microbrushes on them.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Yeah, microbrushes on it, so it does a pretty good job of keeping it clean.

21:48.000 --> 21:56.000
But, I mean, if you're maybe a chain smoker, and you're just like, take a hit off this Wii, you know, and stuff like that, I mean, maybe, maybe then your Wii's kind of fucked up.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Trying to store some weed in your Wii?

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
Yeah, you're trying to, like, fill the Wii with smoke or something, and I don't know, maybe that will cause it to break, but...

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
You bust it open and take a shot back after it.

22:06.000 --> 22:23.000
Really, there isn't a whole lot of, you know, intake. I mean, there's, like, a tiny little fan in that thing anyways, and I don't really see how there could be a lot of dust sitting on your laser, unless you're putting in discs that have been sitting out in the air and just, like, are caked with dust and you throw it in your system.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
Then that's your own damn fault. Either way, it's probably your own damn fault that they don't play, so...

22:28.000 --> 22:49.000
That's pretty much it. And Nintendo, of course, they don't want you trying to fix it yourself, but I don't know, they have a process, I guess, you can fill out a form on Nintendo's website for sending your system in to get it, you know, cleaned, I guess.

22:49.000 --> 23:05.000
I want to mention this comment in chat. It's completely random, but when you talk about smoke, I couldn't help but think about the Rock Band Stage Kit. Maybe you don't want to use too much of that around your Wii, but according to SSJ100Matt in chat, he says, Loki, apparently the Rock Band Stage Kit doesn't hook up to the Wii.

23:05.000 --> 23:23.000
Wrong, it does. See, here's why. Because it doesn't have anything to do with the 360 or the Wii itself, it just hooks up to audio cables, so in theory, you could throw it onto your stereo system and it would work just fine. That's how it's able to work with both systems.

23:23.000 --> 23:31.000
So if I want to get some of my ABBA karaoke CDs and put them on my CD player and use the Rock Band Stage Kit to do, like, an epic version of Chikikita, I could do that?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yes, you can.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
That would be cheap.

23:36.000 --> 23:48.000
Alright, also, speaking of epic on your Wii, we love it when new channels come out for the Wii. Too bad this wasn't for us. It's for the folks in Japan. It's the Terribinotomo channel. That would be TV Friend.

23:48.000 --> 24:03.000
The TV Friend channel came out on the Wii this week. It's basically, like, imagine the TV Guide channel on American TV. That's kind of what they're getting on the Wii, hence why they say it may not come out here, because of the fact that, you know, here in America, on your cable, you already have a TV Guide channel.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
It is pretty cool, though.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
And, you know, we have TV Guide and all that stuff. And plus now with TiVo and, you know, cable's got it built in and all that stuff.

24:10.000 --> 24:27.000
The thing about this, though, that was really cool, at least from the video that I saw of it, is that you can look at multiple days, so you can see what's on, you know, a whole week. Usually some of those, you know, you have to kind of keep progressing hour by hour and kind of, you know, moving along the thing to see what's on the next day and stuff like that.

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
This, you can, it'll be like a whole 3D thing and it'll turn it to the side and you can select different days, like, out and stuff like that.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
That's kind of cool. Does it have a globe I can spin?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
No.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
Because that was the best part of the forecast channel and the news channel, was the spinning globe with the, you know, music. I love the music and the weather channel.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
But, you know, we could go to the grocery store and buy a TV Guide, too, if we wanted an alternative.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
We could, but that's money. And then I have to read.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
This is free.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I'm just kidding.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
So is the internet.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
So are you anti-TV friend channel? You do not want to be TV friend's friend?

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
I don't think that it's necessary. I'm glad that they have it over there, but we don't really need it here. It'd be neat, but...

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Couldn't you say the same thing about the news channel, though? And the forecast channel, really?

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
Is that, you know, you can get all that shit on the internet or you can, you know, watch the nightly news or you can, I don't know, read a newspaper.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
It just depends on what you use more.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I guess that's true.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Now, did you see the other cool thing you can do with this?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
What?

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
When you find your channel or whatever, you can actually use your Wii Remote as a universal remote with your TV.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
I know. I was going to get to that, but that's all right. No. Yeah, the Wii Mode is going to be like a universal remote.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
You can also change channels, do the volume and all that stuff. You can switch between Wii and TV inputs.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
But it's some type of, like, hack that you use with the sensor bar.

25:46.000 --> 25:57.000
Basically, I think what it does is it, I don't know if it causes the IR to bounce off of the sensor bar and bounce off your head or something like that.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
But when I say hack, it's an official Nintendo thing. It's not like, you know, people are hacking their systems to do it.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
It's a Nintendo-endorsed hack.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
So that's kind of neat, though, that they're hacking their own stuff to do weird purposes.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
I don't know why. That strikes me as so amusing, but it does.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
So there you go.

26:14.000 --> 26:24.000
Also, what's kind of interesting, you can stamp programs that you're interested in and then you can share them with either other Wii users or you can send them to Wii Friends.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
And Nintendo calculates popularity scores based on what's been bookmarked.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So, kind of interesting.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
I do like the fact that they are kind of trying to turn the Wii into a one-stop shop.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
Even though news and forecast and, you know, TV and all that is something you can get on the computer anyway,

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
I kind of think it's a neat idea to have it, like, all right there on your TV. It's interesting.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
And, I mean, I know it's something that's available out there right now and other things, but it's free.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
So, I mean, even if you don't use it, it's at least there for you.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Yeah.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
Same with, like, the news channel. I don't read it at all, but, you know, if you want to, you can.

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
It's better, too, to have more stuff to fill your little blank TV screens with on your Wii.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Doesn't that feel good, to fill in those screens?

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
No, I'm almost out of memory on my Wii system.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
What happens when we run out of space? Because you only get four screens to play with.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
I'm like, I'm seriously, I probably have maybe ten screens left. Really?

27:21.000 --> 27:28.000
Yeah, you have to delete stuff or, and then when you run out of space on the actual unit, you have to put stuff on SD memory cards.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I bet you anything Nintendo is going to do something about the memory space this winter.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
They have to for all this WiiWare stuff coming out.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Right. I don't think so.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
No, they're stubborn bastards. They won't do it.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Yeah, Frisbee says external hard drive channel.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
External hard drive channel?

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
Exactly. The SD card management channel, even though it's in the system.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
But something that can, like, just...

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
It would not be that hard to have the Wii read off the SD card just like it does its own internal memory.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
Well, if you want to do something even more annoying, then you can also make this free or possibly as a service.

28:00.000 --> 28:10.000
You can make it like one of those Yahoo internet drives where you can store stuff on a web server and download it to your system that way.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
I know Nintendo says, hey, you can go in the shop channel any time and redownload this stuff for free.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
You don't have to pay for it again.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
But I'm like, I don't know if it's just me. I think the Wii shop channel is slow and clunky.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
It's slow as shit.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Like, I would not have to want to go in there every time.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
It brings me back to the days of the Super Nintendo and 20-

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Do it.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Yeah, it brings me back to the days of Prodigy, okay?

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
That's what the Wii shop channel feels like is Prodigy online.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Eww, blow blow.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
I know.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
You want to know a true story about Prodigy?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
What?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Prodigy is where it all started for me, dude.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
If I did not have Prodigy, the show would not exist.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
That was my first gateway drug to the internet was Prodigy.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
I remember Prodigy.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
I used to have on the forums, I actually had a Nintendo help thread and I would help kids with their video games.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I was like 12 or 13 when this was all going on.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
One time on Prodigy, we decided, me and my friend, there's a joke channel or something like that and you can submit jokes.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
So we thought it would be funny to submit really shitty jokes.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
And we wasted like an hour doing that and then my mom got the phone bill and it was like hundreds of dollars.

29:17.000 --> 29:25.000
When they introduced Prodigy Chat, I got in big trouble because Prodigy Chat was a plus channel and my parents got like a $90 bill.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Needless to say, I wasn't able to use Prodigy for a little while.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Oh yes, Dark Sakura.

29:29.000 --> 29:36.000
Well, I started off on AOL but also after my first year on that, I ended up being a chat host for Cartoon Network.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
So I got a free account.

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
I had an overhead account for a long, long time and then when I quit doing that, they didn't change me back for years.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
So I actually spent like maybe five or six years not being charged for AOL.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
AOL was always kind of the devil to people on Prodigy.

29:53.000 --> 30:00.000
And if anyone wants to know who I was, I was CNW Allura for the Cartoon Network chat back in the day.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
Do you think someone's honestly going to listen to this and be all like, I remember her?

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
Hey, watch. I did a whole bunch on that. So I don't care who knows it was me.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
Dartitsuyen Chat says, Sky, you wanted to grow up to be a Nintendo game counselor?

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
Dude, wasn't that like all of our dreams in junior high school until we realized...

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
No.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Kind of a fancy call center with that guy.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Ever.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
But you could play video games for a living.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Yeah.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
And get paid for it.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
No.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Alright, let's go ahead and move on.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I'm trying to help stupid people get through the game.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
How'd I get more into the jump?

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
Push the B button, or the A button.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
It's not working.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
I bet there's...

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Turn on your system.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
It is.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I bet there were some real dopes that called in. Anyway, sorry.

30:47.000 --> 30:56.000
For more Wii news and not AOL or Prodigy, which we, you know, we called... Nevermind.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
I love that we are on the cutting edge of technology here on this show.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Remember Prodigy?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Sorry.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Comp you suck.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I need people who use that.

31:08.000 --> 31:16.000
Anyway, Okami Wii is actually getting a later release date than was anticipated.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
They originally said March 25th that it's going to be April 15th.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
So, get ready to play it then.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Capcom doesn't really want to tell us why.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
No.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
Is it? Well, I mean, you know, it's not like there isn't a version of Okami already out there.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
So, I think a little weight won't kill anybody.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
I'll tell you why it's not coming out on the 25th, because it's not done. I don't know.

31:41.000 --> 31:49.000
You know why games get delayed surprisingly or something? They fail the little seal of approval check and all that stuff.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah, the seal of approval of anything.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
No, but don't the games have to be ok?

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Xbox 360 games have to go through a Microsoft certification process.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
Nintendo games have to go through something similar. Maybe it failed.

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
Really? You mean they actually put these shitty Destiny games through that same Nintendo seal of approval?

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
Someone actually ok's this shit to come out?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah, that's one.

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
Yes and no. I have heard of the fact that sometimes gaming companies say they don't want these games to come out on their system.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
I've heard of that happening.

32:20.000 --> 32:27.000
But the other thing is that for every Xbox game, you have to refer to the little X button as the guide button.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Your A's have to be colored like the A button and all that stuff.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Somebody actually goes through and makes sure the game is compliant.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
So I bet you anything with Okami, somebody missed something and a Playstation 2 character came over and they had to go back and fix it.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
Oh, I'm glad that they fixed those little details.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I have absolutely nothing to back that up.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
But sometimes these are why games get unexpectedly delayed.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
And if they're not saying anything about it, you never know.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
Who cares? I mean, eh.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
There's nothing coming out in April anyways. At least not in the first half.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
So it's the only thing.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Is the top title of the first half of April now?

33:01.000 --> 33:07.000
I'm going over to chat at chat.orangelaundraider.com and just a completely random comment out of thin air.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
I guess it must have been on another topic.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
gripper01 in chat says, I'm stuck on the second boss on Lost Odyssey.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
It's hard.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
And Lost Odyssey does have some pretty tough bosses in it.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
But you know what's really funny?

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
You'll notice in my gaming week, as much of a love fest as I was having with Lost Odyssey last week, I didn't even play it.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
I didn't touch it this week.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
My roommate comes up to me yesterday and goes, did you stop playing Lost Odyssey?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
It's like I wanted to see more of it.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
I can't remember if I played Lost Odyssey or not because I'm still fighting with that fucking 360 that does not want to work.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
I'm going to throw it away one of these days.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
No, I do fully intend to go back and play more Lost Odyssey.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
It's just I got tied up in Hello.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
I mean, Smash Brothers came out this week and Warcraft Addiction and all that other stuff.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
Some of my other online games got in the way this week too.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Second boss of Lost Odyssey, I'm trying to think.

33:53.000 --> 34:00.000
Yeah, you just have to keep casting spells against it.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
I think it's based on fire, so water spells maybe?

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
Yeah, water spells.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
I don't remember.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
And then after you kill the first one, there's a second one that comes.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
Alright, well let's go ahead and move on with the news.

34:14.000 --> 34:20.000
There's another channel coming soon once Mario Kart is released.

34:20.000 --> 34:26.000
When you get your copy of Mario Kart, it will actually install a new channel called the Mario Kart Wii Channel.

34:26.000 --> 34:33.000
And it will include wonderful things, including an online leaderboard, I believe.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
Global Friend View allows you to see where your friends are located and their online status.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Maybe you can spin that globe, Rob.

34:42.000 --> 34:52.000
Spectator Mode, as well as there's going to be some other cool stuff you can do, like being able to download ghost data.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
Daily Missions, kind of like the mission mode in Mario Kart DS.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
And, what else? Let's see.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
That's pretty much it.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
But I like the fact that you can do Spectator Mode while you're waiting for races and stuff. That's kind of neat.

35:09.000 --> 35:17.000
I think it's interesting, Nintendo's strategy here, to create a whole separate channel dedicated to one of their games.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I actually think it's kind of a neat idea.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
You've got to hand it to Nintendo at least for this much.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
As pretty rad as the Xbox 360 is with its online stuff, it doesn't have a lot like this.

35:29.000 --> 35:37.000
With the exception of stuff like Halo 3 that has their very comprehensive website with obscenely detailed game statistics.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
It's kind of neat to see Nintendo doing something actually integrated on the Wii.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
Hey, they can't do something integrated on the whole system.

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
I don't care if each one of these games has another channel that adds on to it.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
That's fine with me, because I'm not playing 20 games at a time.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Especially the AAA titles that you know tons of people are getting.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
I don't know what you guys have heard about the midnight launches from around the country,

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
but just looking on some of the various gaming blogs, talking to one of my friends that was working at one of the stores,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
it sounds like... packed.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
It sounds like these midnight sales are absolutely packed for Smash Brothers.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
Actually, Dan, of course you know my husband manages a game crazy,

36:17.000 --> 36:23.000
and he was saying that what was packed was the tournament he ran and not so much the midnight sale.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
So people were just going for the tournament and didn't even bother to buy the game?

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Pretty much.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
That's weird.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
I don't know. I think he'll pick it up eventually.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
He said it really thinned out when it came time for the launch.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Huh.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Maybe it was past all their bedtimes. Maybe they're coming back today.

36:39.000 --> 36:45.000
Maybe. I mean, I'd just say it doesn't matter what time they do a launch, pre-order your copy. You'll get it.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
True.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Maybe they didn't have money at the time. Maybe they're just waiting to pick it up later on,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
because it's not like it's going to be hard to find, I don't think.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
I hate calling it pre-ordering, because really you're just reserving.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
It's a deposit.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Ordering. Reserve your copy.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
Let's Have Tea says there were over 300 kids at the one I went to.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
GS68 says I was at the GameStop in Santa Clara this morning and the line was going around the store.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Hmm.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Sounds like things are pretty packed.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
I would say it's definitely Nintendo's version of, you know, it's their Halo.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
It's their, you know, big, big triple-A title that causes people to come out like this.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
And they've got some good stuff coming up, you know, with Mario Kart next.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
I mean, it's not a bad thing to follow.

37:26.000 --> 37:33.000
Alright, well anyhow, moving on with some more Wii news, and of course we'll be talking about other systems later on throughout Part A and Part B,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
but we'll focus on the Wii for a little bit.

37:35.000 --> 37:42.000
I want to talk about WiiWare, and one of the new titles that's going to be coming to WiiWare is a survival horror puzzler.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Yes, that's right, it's a survival horror puzzler, and that actually sounds kind of rad.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
It's coming from WayForward Technologies.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
They made the game Shantae, or Shantae.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Shantae is like somebody's name.

37:54.000 --> 38:01.000
Shantae on Game Boy Color, and it's a game called Lit, and it's being made for WiiWare.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
Lit is going to be about this character Jake, and he's trapped in a high school,

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
and there's evil creatures all around the high school, and he's trying to find his girlfriend Rachel.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
This is WayForward's first original IP since Shantae.

38:13.000 --> 38:20.000
Lit is going to have horror elements, boss battles, and the developers are expecting this to be a big game.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
And the concept art looks kind of neat.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
I'm curious how a survival horror puzzler plays out, but those are two of my favorite genres,

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
so the marriage of them can't be entirely a bad thing, right Jamie?

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
It's going to have cutscenes where you walk through and you meet a zombie that says,

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
Hey, let's puzzle to get past this door.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Is that...

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Like in Kirby's Avalanche.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Or like Puzzle Quest.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
It's like playing Puyo Puyo.

38:44.000 --> 38:51.000
Yes, as if a puzzle quest survival horror game I'm sure would be well accepted.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
So wait, how would Resident Evil puzzler work?

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
Solve this puzzle or Chainsaw Man is going to come after you?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
It's like Puzzle Pirates.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Silly Rob, there's no Chainsaw Man.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Yeah, there is, isn't there?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Yeah, hello?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
This is like the scariest guy in the game.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
The guy with the chainsaw on the first stage that runs up to you and just chops your head right off.

39:09.000 --> 39:15.000
They should totally make another puzzle fighter game and just throw in characters from Resident Evil in there,

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
and you can have Chainsaw Man all chibi style.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
We need Silent Hill vs. Resident Evil the fighting game.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
That'd be rad.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Akdefta dares to say that Pac-Man is a survival horror puzzler.

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
I mean, you do have to solve the puzzle of every maze and you are running from ghosts, right?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Ba dum bum.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Oh!

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
That reminded me of something.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
What's that?

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
I just noticed this while we were watching Tron last week.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
That you can see Pac-Man in the background of one of the levels with Sark.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
End of line.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Sorry, I had to mention that.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Oh, that's fine.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
I always appreciate the random Tron reference.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
I was saying random video game reference, but still.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Did anyone pick up Discs of Tron?

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
No.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
I played the demo and I was like, God damn, this game was cool, and I was seven.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I know, right?

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
And it still wasn't as cool as the other one.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Yeah.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Discs of Tron was better in the movie.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Although, I am still all for it.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Was that you who said that on the show or Jamie?

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
I remember.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Somebody said they should make it a ride at Disneyland.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Discs of Tron should be a ride at Disneyland.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
That's probably Jamie.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Will you fall through the floor?

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
I think I was talking about the people who were having the Tron part.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Why can't they do it with the Wii?

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
Like, you know, you could use your Wii remote like throwing a Frisbee or something.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
That would be cool.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
I know, right?

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
That would be awesome, which is why it will never exist.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
Alright, let's move on.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
So, Tron is coming out.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
No, I'm kidding.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
How do you suggest a ride for Disneyland?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Does Disneyland have a suggestion box?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I think you have to be an Imagineer.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Who's an Imagineer at Disneyland?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
We know people that work for Disney.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Listen to this program.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Because every time Jamie and I talk about our big Disney whoredom.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
Okay, so like Disney Friends of Orange Lawn's radio, you have to make this happen.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
We want a Tron experience.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
I don't care if the movie is like 20 years old.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
It's still all kinds of rad.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
I have a Tron shirt.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Exactly.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Tron is rad.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
The eighties are coming back.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
All they'll do is they'll just like,

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
what the trend has been lately is updating their rides with different movies tied to them.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
You know, like the whole, the old submarine ride.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
It's now like little Nemos.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
So, instead of soaring over California, it'll be like soaring over the light cycles or something?

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Not little Nemos.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Finding Nemos like, or Nemos something or other.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
That would be all kinds of rad if they were placed somewhere.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Oh, come on.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
The submarines needed an overhaul.

41:37.000 --> 41:43.000
What they need to do, what they'll do is they'll just like convert over the teacups to, you know, the discs of Tron.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
You know what?

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
The teacups are like a sacred ride to me, so I almost want to punch you for saying that,

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
but it actually might be kind of cool.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
SSJ100Matt, in response to how to make rides at Disney in chat, says,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Sky, you need a special degree in fun.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
They didn't offer fun as a major in my college.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I'm kind of disappointed.

42:03.000 --> 42:09.000
Rob says, Rob2B says, teacups of Tron.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Okay, we're getting too random.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Please, Jamie, give us a story.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Like I said, Tron's coming out on the Nintendo DS.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
No, I'm kidding.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Shut up!

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
Famitsu has said that Tron, I can't do that.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Okay.

42:21.000 --> 42:29.000
Famitsu reported that Disgaea will be out on the Nintendo DS in Japan,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
titled Disgaea Prince of the Demon World.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
There's not much really else about it,

42:36.000 --> 42:45.000
but it's been rumored that it's actually a port of the original Disgaea Hour of Darkness.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
And apparently unlockable in it is the teacups of Tron.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
Shut up!

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I guess that's kind of cool, though, Disgaea on the DS,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
because now you can take it with you everywhere you go.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
And you can touch them.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
And in order to level up to 9,999 levels, which is an insane amount,

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
you probably would have to take it with you everywhere you go.

43:08.000 --> 43:22.000
The Japanese WeWear promo page has been launched,

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
and they're showing off, I guess, the 11 launch titles that they're going to have for it,

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
including Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Young King, and The Promised Land,

43:32.000 --> 43:38.000
Star Soldier R, a remake of Star Soldier, which looks pretty awesome,

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
World Puzzle Mojipitan...

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
I don't even know how to pronounce that.

43:43.000 --> 43:51.000
Mojipitan Wii, Pokemon Ranch, Dr. Mario's Virus Buster, which looks kind of neat.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
I don't know, I guess you shoot blocks or something.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
I don't know.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
Or I'm thinking it might just be a port of Dr. Mario that might be playable online.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
It looks like you're firing something.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I don't know.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
But, cool.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Let's see, Marubo Shikaku.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I have no idea what that is.

44:11.000 --> 44:17.000
Magnetica, which was that rip-off of Zuma.

44:17.000 --> 44:24.000
Bomberman, looks like Ookiraku Ping Pong Wii.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
And Angel's Solitaire.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Ooh, hooray, ping pong on the Wii.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
I'm so excited.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
That's never been done.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
And Joy Sound Wii.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I have no idea what that is either.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Maybe a music-based game for the Wii?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
I don't know, it makes sense.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Maybe.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
I don't know.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
But they had some screenshots of some different things.

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
Looks like the Dr. Mario game looks pretty cool.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I guess that's Star Soldier, the one that...

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
That middle one is Star Soldier.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
And then the bottom one's Magnetica.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Does the website have any information about...

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
I don't know where you're going to store all this stuff?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
I don't know.

45:03.000 --> 45:09.000
I heard a rumor, though, that Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game was going to take

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
up all your memory.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
I don't know.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
It's stupid, though.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
It's so crazy.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
Oh my god, that's creepy, that Pokemon game.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
I know.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
Oh my god.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
It's so creepy-looking.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
But, yeah, some of the other games, like, I don't know what that puzzle game is.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
There's another one that kind of looks like Sudoku, but it's not.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Crystal Chronicles looks good.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
I don't know.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I'm pretty impressed so far.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
I'm actually sort of looking forward to Star Soldier R, but really there's only one good

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
thing to me that has come out of the Star Soldier franchise.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Which is?

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Star Parodia.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
You and your Parodius love.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
No, it's not Parodius.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Oh.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
I thought it was related.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
This is probably going to end up being a game of the week, but it was a game that was on

45:50.000 --> 45:57.000
PC Engine, where you played either as Bomberman, or the ship from Star Soldier, or a flying

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
PC Engine, and the PC Engine would shoot cue cards and CDs.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Interesting.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
Well, another game we know Jamie loves is Pac-Man Versus.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.400
Pac-Man Versus was a game where you could, like, its big niche was that you could actually

46:11.400 --> 46:13.000
play as the ghost.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.800
Well, somebody else has kind of taken an idea like that.

46:15.800 --> 46:18.380
Let's take a classic arcade game, but, like, reverse it.

46:18.380 --> 46:20.200
And the classic game is Space Invaders.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.200
Rad.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.600
Now, here's the thing.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.000
Space Invaders Extreme is actually kind of sexy.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.560
Like, I don't know if you've played it, like, I remember Loki brought on the show.

46:28.560 --> 46:32.880
Space Invaders Extreme is kind of like Luminous meets Space Invaders, which is, like, really

46:32.880 --> 46:33.880
cool.

46:33.880 --> 46:37.740
And so now it's kind of caused a resurgence of Space Invaders, which was always really

46:37.740 --> 46:38.740
popular in Japan.

46:38.740 --> 46:42.400
I mean, Space Invaders was always way more popular in Japan, probably, than it even was

46:42.400 --> 46:43.400
here.

46:43.400 --> 46:46.800
What's interesting is that Taito is going to be making an update to the game called

46:46.800 --> 46:49.700
Space Invaders Get Even.

46:49.700 --> 46:55.560
And in this game, you will be in control of up to 300 Space Invaders, and you get to do

46:55.560 --> 46:57.360
death and destruction on human people.

46:57.360 --> 46:59.000
Looks like Pikmin, sort of.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.240
I guess, yeah.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.920
It's been compared to Pikmin and Rampage.

47:01.920 --> 47:04.180
Oh, wow, they're all sprite-y.

47:04.180 --> 47:08.640
No idea yet if it is an actual game, like, disc game, or if it's a WiiWare game, but

47:08.640 --> 47:14.120
either way, I say yes to more Space Invaders nostalgia, because they really did a good

47:14.120 --> 47:17.680
job of the extreme, and this looks kind of fun, too.

47:17.680 --> 47:21.640
So I'm all for some human killing in Space Invaders.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.120
It should be fun.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.120
Do you approve Dark Sakura?

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
Oh, hell yeah.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.120
All right.

47:26.120 --> 47:28.160
Well, there's other things that I approve of.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.160
What's that?

47:29.160 --> 47:32.560
That's actually the UK Virtual Consoles stuff that's coming out.

47:32.560 --> 47:35.320
That's awfully nice of you to approve of that when you can't download them here.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.320
So?

47:36.320 --> 47:37.320
We will eventually.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.320
Yeah, I guess that's true.

47:38.320 --> 47:43.200
I mean, we pretty much mirrored, you know, eventually what comes out there in here.

47:43.200 --> 47:44.200
True.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.200
And vice versa.

47:45.200 --> 47:51.640
So what's coming out is Kirby 64, the Crystal Shards, which, like the title suggests, is

47:51.640 --> 47:52.880
a Nintendo 64 game.

47:52.880 --> 48:00.520
It's a thousand Wii points, or seven pounds, and it's a lot of Kirby 3D joy and running

48:00.520 --> 48:05.160
around and, you know, sucking, I guess.

48:05.160 --> 48:17.040
So also coming out is Psychosis, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, 600 Wii points.

48:17.040 --> 48:24.480
And basically, now this game had a really cool premise, I thought, that you were entering

48:24.480 --> 48:31.440
your own mind as a spaceship to get rid of something that's invaded your mind.

48:31.440 --> 48:32.440
So it's sort of like R-Type.

48:32.440 --> 48:33.440
Interesting.

48:33.440 --> 48:42.960
However, it's got this sort of surrealist pattern to it.

48:42.960 --> 48:44.960
It's pretty cool.

48:44.960 --> 48:47.000
Huh.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.160
Are these games that you would pay money to re-download?

48:49.160 --> 48:51.800
Well, Psychosis maybe.

48:51.800 --> 48:54.160
Oh, and there's another one there that I'd probably get.

48:54.160 --> 48:55.160
What's that?

48:55.160 --> 48:59.360
Super Turrican, which was an SNES game.

48:59.360 --> 49:07.840
It's 800 points for a virtual console, and it's basically just run-and-shoot stuff.

49:07.840 --> 49:08.840
It's a side-scroller.

49:08.840 --> 49:10.760
Wasn't that this week's release here, Loki?

49:10.760 --> 49:12.000
I can't remember.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.600
Actually, the lists I've got are just ones coming out this month.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.380
That's all right.

49:17.380 --> 49:21.200
This month, at least from Sega, we're going to get two titles from them.

49:21.200 --> 49:26.120
One is Puyo Puyo 2, so that should be pretty cool.

49:26.120 --> 49:33.560
And the other one is Powerball, which does not have anything to do with the lotto, unfortunately.

49:33.560 --> 49:37.920
It's like a hybrid of rugby and football.

49:37.920 --> 49:39.960
So interesting.

49:39.960 --> 49:41.280
That's kind of neat, I guess.

49:41.280 --> 49:46.600
Both those, I believe, were Genesis titles, so if I remember correctly, I think it's like

49:46.600 --> 49:47.600
800 points.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.600
Puyo Puyo 2.

49:49.600 --> 49:51.480
Ravenstaufen makes a good point.

49:51.480 --> 49:55.440
Super Turrican was one of the Super Nintendo games that actually supported Dolby Surround

49:55.440 --> 49:57.720
. There were a handful of games that did that.

49:57.720 --> 49:58.720
That's cool.

49:58.720 --> 50:01.960
I want to ask you, Dark Soccer, because I know you gave a big woohoo when we heard about

50:01.960 --> 50:02.960
Puyo Puyo 2.

50:02.960 --> 50:08.200
I know the original Puyo Puyo was kind of what we know over here as Dr. Robotnik's

50:08.200 --> 50:12.280
Mean Bean Machine, the Kirby game, Kirby Avalanche, right?

50:12.280 --> 50:13.280
Kirby's Avalanche.

50:13.280 --> 50:16.200
What makes Puyo Puyo 2 so woohoo-worthy?

50:16.200 --> 50:18.840
It's Puyo Puyo.

50:18.840 --> 50:24.280
For puzzle games, the Puyo Puyo series is my favorite of all time.

50:24.280 --> 50:29.160
I could sit and play this for hours, and I can get through this more than I can get through

50:29.160 --> 50:30.160
Tetris.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.160
I'll put it that way.

50:31.160 --> 50:37.000
And I was really, really addicted and good at Tetris, but Puyo Puyo is like...

50:37.000 --> 50:43.040
It's just the whole, you know, not only do you have to just, you know, make lines and

50:43.040 --> 50:51.640
get rid of stuff, but you have to use strategy to, you know, cripple your opponent, too.

50:51.640 --> 50:56.040
I mean, it's the same concept you get in Puzzle Fighter, which is why I also like Puzzle Fighter

50:56.040 --> 50:57.440
a whole lot.

50:57.440 --> 51:05.960
But my very first Puyo Puyo that I played was Kirby's Avalanche, and it was just...

51:05.960 --> 51:09.240
I still have my copy, my original copy, that I bought when it was new.

51:09.240 --> 51:12.280
I think I do, in my big gaming archive somewhere.

51:12.280 --> 51:17.880
But I mean, as far as puzzlers go, I think that was one of the big ones to really, you

51:17.880 --> 51:21.800
know, make that competitive, fun edge in a puzzle game.

51:21.800 --> 51:25.920
DJ Dark Knight in chat says, I wish the newer Puyo Puyo for the DS was stateside.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.240
I thought we did have a DS Puyo Puyo.

51:28.240 --> 51:30.400
Or is there, like, a newer version that came out in Japan?

51:30.400 --> 51:31.400
I guess there must be.

51:31.400 --> 51:34.240
Well, we got Puyo Pop, I think.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.760
Yeah, which is okay.

51:36.760 --> 51:42.800
I still actually need to go back and get Puyo Puyo Sun on Saturn, because that one's supposed

51:42.800 --> 51:44.120
to be really, really good.

51:44.120 --> 51:47.680
Oh, DJ Dark Knight says the newer one is on Wi-Fi.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.000
That's pretty rad.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
That's really cool.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
That is very cool.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.080
Well, since we talked about virtual console releases, let's talk about some things that

51:54.080 --> 51:57.720
are going to be sold in a more traditional format this week and travel around the world

51:57.720 --> 51:59.080
and talk about the release dates.

51:59.080 --> 52:00.760
I'll start off with Japan tonight.

52:00.760 --> 52:06.200
Xbox 360 in Japan is getting Skate on March 13th from Electronic Arts.

52:06.200 --> 52:10.400
Moving on to other systems in Japan, PlayStation 3 also getting Skate, but they're also getting

52:10.400 --> 52:14.040
Winning Post 7 Maximum 2008.

52:14.040 --> 52:16.080
I'm not actually sure what kind of sport that is.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.080
Winning Post?

52:17.080 --> 52:18.080
It's horse racing.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.440
Yeah, I was going to say.

52:20.440 --> 52:26.720
It's still not Derby Owners Club or Final Furlong, which will always be one of my favorite

52:26.720 --> 52:27.720
arcade games.

52:27.720 --> 52:28.720
Final Furlong is Hump A Horse.

52:28.720 --> 52:33.960
I thought they had some horse racing games on the Wii in Japan.

52:33.960 --> 52:35.120
I wish those were coming over here.

52:35.120 --> 52:36.120
That'd be funny.

52:36.120 --> 52:39.400
Well, I'm assuming that there must be six other games in this particular series, seeing

52:39.400 --> 52:41.120
as they have a seven in it.

52:41.120 --> 52:47.360
All right, well anyway, on the Nintendo Wii, also Winning Post 7 Maximum 2008, which must

52:47.360 --> 52:51.960
be kind of fun on the Wii, I imagine, if the Wii controls are what I imagine they are,

52:51.960 --> 52:54.320
where you actually would get to whip your horse with the remote.

52:54.320 --> 52:55.320
Mush!

52:55.320 --> 52:58.260
I remember when you had Politary.

52:58.260 --> 52:59.260
The horse?

52:59.260 --> 53:00.260
Yeah.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.260
Oh, Derby Owners Club.

53:01.260 --> 53:02.260
Good times.

53:02.260 --> 53:03.260
I miss that game.

53:03.260 --> 53:04.260
Speaking of which, I didn't even mention this during the gaming week.

53:04.260 --> 53:05.680
I'm going to take a tangent real fast.

53:05.680 --> 53:06.680
I don't care.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.480
You know how we were going to go play DDR on, I think it was Wednesday night, right?

53:09.480 --> 53:10.480
Yeah.

53:10.480 --> 53:11.480
We were going to play DDR.

53:11.480 --> 53:15.320
Well, and then you had to cancel because you had other things going on, but William and

53:15.320 --> 53:17.760
I went down there anyway, just to check it out.

53:17.760 --> 53:20.400
It's frickin' Arcade Mania on Wednesday nights.

53:20.400 --> 53:22.360
Let's go on Thursdays and stuff.

53:22.360 --> 53:23.360
Bleh.

53:23.360 --> 53:24.360
And I think they...

53:24.360 --> 53:25.880
I don't remember seeing the Derby Machine.

53:25.880 --> 53:27.520
I don't know if they got rid of it.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.520
No!

53:28.520 --> 53:29.520
I think it might still be there.

53:29.520 --> 53:30.520
I don't want to cause a panic yet.

53:30.520 --> 53:32.520
They put it in the bathroom or something.

53:32.520 --> 53:33.520
Probably.

53:33.520 --> 53:34.520
Anyway, sorry.

53:34.520 --> 53:38.440
What would this show be without my random tangents?

53:38.440 --> 53:39.440
Come on.

53:39.440 --> 53:43.280
Transformers the Game also coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan.

53:43.280 --> 53:47.480
If you haven't heard yet, you shouldn't buy this game, because it sucks.

53:47.480 --> 53:51.000
Well, here's something that they're saying does not suck, and it's actually all kinds

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
of cool.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.760
Baroque on the Wii makes its way in Japan this week, and that is our role-playing game

53:56.760 --> 53:58.440
that's going to be pretty hot.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.280
A few more weeks, we're going to get that too.

54:00.280 --> 54:03.680
Yeah, it is coming out here, but if you want to get an early sneak peek and you can understand

54:03.680 --> 54:05.600
Japanese, you might want to import that.

54:05.600 --> 54:07.600
Or if you live in Japan, check it out.

54:07.600 --> 54:11.600
PlayStation 2, guess what, winning post 7, also on PlayStation 2.

54:11.600 --> 54:17.040
Also this week on March 13th, where would we be without a Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle

54:17.040 --> 54:18.040
Orchestra?

54:18.040 --> 54:19.040
Woohoo!

54:19.040 --> 54:20.640
Oh, it's actually just a price reduction.

54:20.640 --> 54:21.640
It's not a new release.

54:21.640 --> 54:22.640
My bad.

54:22.640 --> 54:26.760
They should do like a new Owen Dunn-type game with Evangelion.

54:26.760 --> 54:27.760
What's that?

54:27.760 --> 54:29.240
I have one of the Evangelion games.

54:29.240 --> 54:31.440
See, I'm so glad I'm not the only one that does tangents.

54:31.440 --> 54:32.800
Yes, Jamie, you have one of the games.

54:32.800 --> 54:33.800
What is it?

54:33.800 --> 54:38.400
It's on Saturn, not the Steel Girlfriend, but the other one that came out.

54:38.400 --> 54:41.440
And all it is, is really confusing.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.320
It's like a dating sim.

54:43.320 --> 54:48.160
If this one's like the others, it's like a dating sim where you play as, I guess you

54:48.160 --> 54:52.960
play as Shinji and then you choose different things in battle, then really it's just, oh

54:52.960 --> 54:53.960
look, it's shooting.

54:53.960 --> 54:54.960
Bang.

54:54.960 --> 54:55.960
Oh look, the creature falls.

54:55.960 --> 54:56.960
Bang.

54:56.960 --> 55:01.080
How could you think about dating now when the world is ending?

55:01.080 --> 55:04.080
I don't know, we've seen End of Evangelion.

55:04.080 --> 55:08.720
Alright, if I may move on with the releases, there is a new release on PlayStation 2, and

55:08.720 --> 55:11.440
it even comes with a limited edition if you want to get it.

55:11.440 --> 55:17.320
12 Riven, the psi criminal of Intergal, that's the name of the games coming out in Japan.

55:17.320 --> 55:22.440
Let's see, check out the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, Call of Duty 4.

55:22.440 --> 55:26.440
I didn't know they had to wait for this game, Contra Dual Spirits finally comes out in Japan

55:26.440 --> 55:28.140
this week.

55:28.140 --> 55:35.580
Jewel Love, Kosuru Otome wa Shiori no Joshin comes out as well.

55:35.580 --> 55:39.320
Lots of titles this week, more stuff in the Simple DS series.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.320
Yu-Gi-Oh!

55:40.320 --> 55:48.360
Spirit Summoner gets a price reduction, and Koinu no Heya, and Kantan Tanoshi Okuyashi

55:48.360 --> 55:51.720
Navi DS comes out from Koi.

55:51.720 --> 55:56.800
And oh, this is kind of rad, The Legend of Kage 2, Kage Densetsu comes out.

55:56.800 --> 56:00.320
I forgot that they were, I remember now hearing a story about that they were making a sequel

56:00.320 --> 56:01.320
to The Legend of Kage.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.200
That's kind of rad.

56:03.200 --> 56:06.920
So that will be coming out on the Nintendo DS, and lastly, let me see if there's anything

56:06.920 --> 56:14.720
of note on the PSP, oh, Dark Sakura, Parodius Portable gets a price reduction this week.

56:14.720 --> 56:15.720
Woo-hoo!

56:15.720 --> 56:16.720
You want to check that out?

56:16.720 --> 56:17.720
Time to import.

56:17.720 --> 56:19.640
Same thing with the Salamander Portable, and Twinbee Portable.

56:19.640 --> 56:20.640
Woo-hoo!

56:20.640 --> 56:21.640
Jamie, you need to go on a shopping spree.

56:21.640 --> 56:22.640
Really time to import.

56:22.640 --> 56:23.900
You need to go on a shopping spree.

56:23.900 --> 56:25.720
No new games, but easy.

56:25.720 --> 56:29.320
I love Twinbee and Parodius and Salamander.

56:29.320 --> 56:34.200
Some accessories come out like Easy Pouch Portable and Inner Pouch Portable.

56:34.200 --> 56:41.320
If you ever wanted to camouflage Inner Pouch, here's your chance.

56:41.320 --> 56:42.320
Let's move on.

56:42.320 --> 56:43.320
Please.

56:43.320 --> 56:51.040
We've got our UK releases on the 13th is Sam and Max episode 204, Chariots of the Dogs

56:51.040 --> 56:52.380
on PC.

56:52.380 --> 56:57.000
And the 14th, Rob's favorite, Build-a-Bear Workshop on the DS.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Oh, hooray.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
The 14th is...

56:59.000 --> 57:01.600
That is coming for Wii sometime soon, too.

57:01.600 --> 57:02.600
Yay!

57:02.600 --> 57:13.360
The 14th is CSI Hard Evidence, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker on DS, Fish Tycoon, Flat Out

57:13.360 --> 57:24.480
Head On, Jumper on Wii, Master of Illusion on DS, No More Heroes on Wii, Star Trek Conquest,

57:24.480 --> 57:29.740
which will be PS2 and Wii, The Spiderwick Chronicles on DS, and Turning Point Fall of

57:29.740 --> 57:33.240
Liberty on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.400
There's another Star Trek game coming out?

57:35.400 --> 57:38.320
Please tell me it doesn't suck, like the last one that came out on 360.

57:38.320 --> 57:39.320
I still wouldn't.

57:39.320 --> 57:40.320
On 360?

57:40.320 --> 57:41.320
Yeah.

57:41.320 --> 57:42.320
There was a...

57:42.320 --> 57:43.320
What was it, Armada or whatever it was called?

57:43.320 --> 57:44.320
There was a game that came out.

57:44.320 --> 57:47.040
It was on the Wii and...

57:47.040 --> 57:48.280
I think it was on the Wii.

57:48.280 --> 57:49.280
The Wii and PS2.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.280
Oh, that's right.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.280
That's right.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.280
It came out around November for us.

57:52.280 --> 57:54.000
I'm waiting for the Star Trek anime, though.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.120
That's going to be fun.

57:56.120 --> 57:57.120
I hope it happens.

57:57.120 --> 57:58.120
I know it keeps changing.

57:58.120 --> 57:59.120
Anyway, sorry.

57:59.120 --> 58:00.120
Okay.

58:00.120 --> 58:05.800
In the US, we're getting some good stuff this week.

58:05.800 --> 58:10.760
Of course today, Smash Brothers, if you haven't picked it up yet, or just, I don't know, maybe

58:10.760 --> 58:17.080
you haven't heard over the last six months that it's coming out today, it has.

58:17.080 --> 58:21.080
Later this week, though, we've got some cool stuff, including Condemned 2, Bloodshot, that's

58:21.080 --> 58:25.480
coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

58:25.480 --> 58:29.400
If you're in the mood for a light gun game for the Wii, we've got House of the Dead 2

58:29.400 --> 58:33.680
and 3 Returns for a whopping $29.99.

58:33.680 --> 58:35.000
Not bad.

58:35.000 --> 58:39.560
And let's see, also Insecticide is going to be on the DS.

58:39.560 --> 58:43.520
That was supposed to be one of those adventure games, almost kind of like a LucasArts type

58:43.520 --> 58:46.480
thing from Gamecock.

58:46.480 --> 58:55.760
And Pro Evo 2008, that's on almost every system out there, Konami's a soccer game.

58:55.760 --> 59:02.480
Buzz Junior RoboJam, if you have preschoolers, they might like that.

59:02.480 --> 59:09.760
Nano Straight 2 on the DS, that's a good shooter game, if you like some of those Japanese-style

59:09.760 --> 59:10.760
ones.

59:10.760 --> 59:17.640
Wild Arms XF, a really cool game from XSeed, that's on PSP.

59:17.640 --> 59:26.400
There's also a collection of previously released wrestling games, WWE Smackdown vs Raw Super

59:26.400 --> 59:34.920
Star series, and I believe the last three games are released in that.

59:34.920 --> 59:40.760
Buzz The Hollywood Quiz, that's on PlayStation 2 as well this week.

59:40.760 --> 59:46.900
Also Ratchet and Clank Size Matters on PlayStation 2, and let's see, World Championship Cards

59:46.900 --> 59:48.400
on PSP.

59:48.400 --> 59:52.760
That's, I don't know, looks kind of boring.

59:52.760 --> 01:00:01.600
You can't wait for the wireless nunchuck adapter, they've got the cord-free wireless adapter

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.160
for your existing nunchucks, so until the actual wireless nunchuck comes out, that'll

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.780
I guess have to do.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:17.900
And then, unfortunately, I have to mention this, but I believe, no actually that may

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:22.880
be Monday, whatever, but coming out next week, or the week after next I should say, I had

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.160
judgment, BioLith Rebellion 2 booster pack.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.560
There's cards for that.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:33.500
We need a million copies to sell, folks!

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:38.480
And no, we will not be including the booster packs, I'm afraid.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.680
Aww, jerk.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.680
Never mind, don't buy it.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.720
Alright, but didn't we get to include the sales of some other game?

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.640
Was it Let's Be Friends Forever?

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.800
I don't remember.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.720
Was it Let's Ride Friends Forever?

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.720
Maybe, I don't remember.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.160
I think it may have been Let's Ride Friends Forever, I don't know.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.840
Just gotta keep track of all these games.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.080
Alright, that are part of the bet.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.220
Well, one game definitely wasn't a part of the bet because it probably would have sold

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:08.540
tons of copies and Loki would be running around in a tingle suit before we know it, is Bully.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:13.160
But some people who bought the new version of Bully on the 360 this week apparently were

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.160
left pretty disappointed.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.960
Basically the game came out and it was buggy.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.520
There's audio glitches, frame rate problems, crashes.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:28.600
This game definitely did not really do very well in QA or something, or I don't know if

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600
they were asleep or what.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.320
Or they just said, release it, we'll fix it in a week.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320
Well, who knows?

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.320
I mean, I don't know.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.480
I don't know who's to blame for this.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.200
Maybe they were doing it on dev kits or something and something changed.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.200
I don't know.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.120
But regardless, a Rockstar Games has basically come out and made a public apology.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.440
Really just a giant, my bad.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.680
But they are going to be doing a title update via Xbox Live.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.320
They are going to release a patch sometime in the next week.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.720
No word yet if Rockstar is actually going to be offering a complete replacement program

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.600
kind of like had to happen for Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.120
Probably not, because they're fixing it.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.240
They can patch it on 360.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.000
The Wii doesn't really have anything built in the place where they can patch that stuff,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.960
so that's why they did the full replacements.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.520
Did you pick up Bully by chance?

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.600
Do you own any version of Bully?

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.200
No, I don't own Bully.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.040
I think I may try it on the Wii.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.120
I don't know, we'll see.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.080
Does the Wii have all the waggle controls and all that good stuff?

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.080
It does.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.080
And I don't know.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.680
I'm not, I don't really have time to play it right now, that's the problem.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.960
Maybe later I'll pick it up when it drops in price some more.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.080
Boy, our chat room is full of comedians tonight.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:41.240
Rob with 2B says maybe Bully was a typo for Buggy.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:49.480
And Tigerclaw says the 360 has been bullied from the sounds of it.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.720
No two drink minimum here, folks.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.040
All for free in chat.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.920
Well, how about a little bit of better news?

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:01.460
This is for people who, like me, have an iPhone.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.640
There are games coming out on the iPhone, finally.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:13.760
And among them is an adaptation of Spore for iPhone, and Super Monkey Ball, with updated

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.880
graphics and everything, going to be on the iPhone.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:22.720
There's also the actual first game is going to be called Touch Fighter, which you use

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.800
as a, I guess like a steering wheel.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.640
The note on here says it took two weeks to develop, so it probably isn't going to be

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.360
all that great.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:42.680
And then there's also some talk about worms, possibly a port of worms and a few other things.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:49.000
And Apple's going to be making 30% of every sale, so that's going to be good news for

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.800
them.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.440
I'm going to have some Monkey Ball.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.840
That sounds so wrong.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:03.960
Gold Banjo calls it Eye Spore, and oh man, we unleashed a beast, because me reading jokes

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.760
in chat, just now everything's going downhill now.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.120
Son of Dad says, Eye Spore would be an eye sore.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:18.200
Oh my God, he did not say that, did he?

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.200
Yes.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.200
Startezia, no.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.200
What?

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.360
I can't talk to you, you don't have an iPhone.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.440
One of Extrofer's quotes, I was in one of his YouTubes.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.400
It's funny stuff, anyway, tangent, hello.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.400
That's us, the tangent cast.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:41.400
So Bungie, after hearing the story last week about a kid who sent in his Xbox 360, that

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:49.600
had been signed by various members of the Bungie team and also from Rooster Teeth, the

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:57.160
folks who do Red vs. Blue, having it come back completely wiped clean, Bungie has actually

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:03.640
rallied together to kind of, I don't know, make up for Microsoft's mistake.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.040
And they've, I think, gone a little bit above and beyond.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:15.360
They sent him a full, I don't know, swag box, basically, with a signed Halo 3 helmet signed

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:24.920
by the entire team of Bungie and just a whole bunch of other swag from Halo 3, including

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:31.360
the limited edition controllers, the Tom McFarland figurines, faceplates, wall graphics, just

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.480
everything.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.360
So good job, Bungie.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.840
I thought that was really cool of them, too.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.860
They didn't have to, it wasn't their fault, but they made good on it.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:47.020
Achievement unlocked, as successfully kissed.

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:49.480
I don't have the little noise, sorry.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.200
You need to get on that.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.720
I know, I will work on that.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.800
Maybe for part B I will get the achievement unlock noise for you guys.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.840
One thing that is probably inevitable that's going to happen at some point is that Microsoft's

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:07.080
going to want to upgrade those hard drives that are custom to come with the 3, I'm sorry,

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.400
is the show boring you, Dark Soccer?

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.400
No.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.400
Just let out a big old yawn.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.880
I don't know if the mic picked that up.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.880
I don't know.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880
I needed oxygen.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880
All right.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.880
No, that's all right.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.240
Anyhow, apparently Microsoft is going to be getting rid of the 20 gigabyte hard drive

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.760
that it currently comes with the core system, but no worries, it's actually something better

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.760
that's going to happen.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.800
They're going to get a 60 gigabyte system.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.360
So the core system is going away, and instead you're going to get a pro system.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:37.960
So that's coming from a site named Trusted Reviews, and they seem pretty sure about this

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.200
new world exclusive they've got.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:46.720
And usually we don't trust no-name sites, but then again, what are we, right?

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.840
Here's my thought on it.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.080
It makes sense.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.600
I guess it makes sense.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.120
I don't think they're going to get rid of the core system, because they still have that

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.120
argument.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.120
I'm sorry.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.120
I meant premium, not core.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.120
What the hell was I thinking?

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.120
Thank you, chat.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:04.400
The premium system, what they may do, because the cost of storage is obviously coming down,

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:10.560
is they may just start replacing the 20s with 60s, so eventually they won't be selling the

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.840
20 gig hard drive anymore.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.840
It'll just come with a 60 gig hard drive, probably for the same price.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.520
Or hey, maybe they'll include a price drop in that at the same time.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.200
Wouldn't that be awesome?

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.840
But I doubt it.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.600
This would make a lot of sense, though, that this is just a matter of time before this

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.320
comes out, so we shall see.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:40.160
Well, as far as other things to see, and this makes me happy, there is going to be, finally,

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:47.840
a Doctor Who game coming out for the DS, PS2, and PC, and that makes me very, very, very

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.200
happy.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:53.400
And I'm assuming that you'd probably play as the 10th Doctor.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.760
I mean, I would just assume, although it'd be kind of cool if you get your choice, you

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:03.600
know, or if you, like, play as a Dalek and exterminate everything in your path, I think

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.600
that that would be awesome.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:09.640
And you know, there were Doctor Who games, like, you know, back in, you know, the early

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.680
80s, I think, but this just makes me happy.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:19.120
It would be kind of cool, though, if you could play as a Cyberman and upgrade everybody.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.280
Any details about, like, what exactly the game's going to tell?

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:25.580
Because I seem to remember we had this announcement on the show before, but it was, like, a rumor,

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:28.600
so I'm just kind of curious, like, did we get any bonus information, or is this just

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.160
people wanting us to remember that it is coming soon?

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:37.720
Eidos is bringing it out, and the quote is not too far away as far as the release date,

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.400
so it gets the soon category.

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.880
So it will be coming soon.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.400
I would say probably later than soon.

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.620
Well, congratulations, DarkSakura, you have successfully worked a Doctor Who reference

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:50.620
into our program.

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:51.620
Woohoo!

01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:52.620
There you go.

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.200
I told you I'd find the noise at some point.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.200
Good job.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.200
Good job.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.200
Now, Loki, if you...

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.760
He's keeping track of our achievement points, chat room.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:12.620
Now, Loki, if you can successfully read the next story with no boo-boos, 30 gamerscore.

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:18.120
So Sega made an announcement basically this week saying that they're not interested in

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.720
a buyout from EA.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.720
So basically they had an interview with Rooters, and the Sega Sammy CEO Simon Jeffries said

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.800
his company is eager to ride the industry's recent wave of consolidation.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.640
That's not an area we want to play in right now.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.560
He said we have no interest in being acquired, we are very happy with our position right

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.140
now.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.160
My thought on this is, who asked you?

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.160
I mean, no one's trying to buy Sega right now, so...

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.560
Well, Loki, tell us what you really think.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.800
Well, we don't want to be bought out right now.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.100
That's okay, we don't want to buy you right now either, so...

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.320
That's exactly what Ross Steel, UT, and chat says.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:02.160
Who the hell wants to buy Sega Sammy?

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.560
That's kind of sad.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.920
I know, I know, but you know, it's just kind of like, well, we don't want to be bought

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.920
out, see?

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.440
It's not like they're not getting offered to be bought out, it's just like, well, even

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.760
if we were offered we'd say no, so...

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:20.000
And Ranma and chat says, leave Sega alone!

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.760
They don't have to make games for you!

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:36.200
I mean, if they did buy Sega, you would get the rights to the official Beijing 2008 Olympics

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.200
game.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.200
Ooh, maybe.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.640
Didn't Sega make the Mario Sonic game, or did somebody else make that?

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.880
Sega made the Mario Sonic game.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.720
And you know, the Mario Sonic game did pretty well.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.960
It sold 5 million worldwide.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:46.960
That's right.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.960
Man, a lot of people are suckers.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.960
I think that was one of the stories that was lost in our Part B destroyage last week, but

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960
you know.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:58.720
Well, you know, EA and Sega could team up, you know, possibly on The Sims 3, because

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.320
The Sims 3, you know, has been actually announced that it is coming, and here's the thing about

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:10.240
The Sims 3, here's the big twist, in The Sims 3 you will be going outside.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:16.280
Now not in real life, unfortunately, but The Sims 3 will focus a little more on outdoor

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280
life.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.000
It's supposed to have a more large, and like, just a gigantic neighborhood, where if you

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.360
actually leave your house, you get into a much bigger area that you can kind of play

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360
with.

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.920
And kill Sims.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.920
Hopefully.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:34.980
So, Sims mood, Sims motives, that whole thing is changing.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.720
Players are going to be encouraged to just, you know, be more social.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.600
It's going to be more of a social game, as opposed to you getting your points for, you

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:46.240
know, remembering to eat and sleep and poop and all that stuff, so.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:51.640
Speaking of which, there will be no more P meter in The Sims.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.560
They are getting rid of that in The Sims 3.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.900
Here's a quote from the latest issue of Games for Windows magazine, quote, the biggest change

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:02.620
to The Sims 3 is that it takes place in a wide open, constantly changing neighborhood,

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:06.520
a much bigger sandbox, if you will, and a much more complex situation.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.640
The town and park you see on the cover image to the right exists in the same seamless space

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.640
as your Sims household, and what you do outside your home now matters as much as what you

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.640
do within.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.640
And somewhere in the-

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.640
So you can't let yourself in front of people?

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.640
Unfortunately, no.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:27.800
Dude, the best thing was to send somebody on a date and ignore their P meter?

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.840
I think the best thing was my old roommate, Billy, did the best house ever, it was hilarious.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.120
He had seven gay guys all in a house, and you know, he had them all making out with

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.880
each other or whatever, and then there was one woman that lived there.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.000
Well somewhere along the line, he forgot to build a bathroom, so the poor woman just had

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.040
to clean up all the guys' messes, and eventually she died of fatigue, it was really sad.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.000
But she could never go to bed, because she always had to-

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.560
Julie made the death house, which had like a swimming pool with no ladder, and had flammable

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.000
objects, and she wouldn't teach them how to cook, but she'd make them cook.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.280
The thing is, they won't jump into the pool unless you put a ladder in.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.280
Well that's right, but you take it out.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.680
Yeah, you take it out once they're in the pool, and then they don't know how to get

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.320
out of the pool without a ladder.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.000
I love it.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.880
It's like, you know, ordinary people can climb out of a pool without a ladder, but oh, the

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.480
Sims just can't do it.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:28.480
And then you'd make like cells, you know, where you put them in the room and then you

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.080
remove the door, so they're just trapped in the room.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:35.600
You trap them in the wall and you put a table with a radio on it, full blast, next to them.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.880
And she had like a full graveyard in the backyard.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.480
You know, I'm thinking we have issues.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.800
Like seriously, issues.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.200
I like snatching people off the street in debug mode and throwing them into my house

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:53.680
and they're never to be seen ever again.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:54.680
This is so wrong!

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.680
Alright.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.680
That's beautiful.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.080
I like your psychosis there.

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:04.120
Dark Sakura, we really need you to bring some sanity back to the show.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.040
Dude, I was bringing the insanity.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.120
And well, I guess it's only going to continue because this is the part of the show we like

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:16.120
to call Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.120
I have a game.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.840
Please say you've picked something relatively sane for the listeners tonight.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.160
Hell no!

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.760
I've picked something intensely insane.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.200
I have VibRibbon as our game of the week, which is quite insane.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.960
Now, this would have nothing to do with the fact that you have kind of like brought up

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:37.080
this game and referenced it on previous shows.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.800
I just wanted to pick it.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.800
Oh, okay.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.800
Well, you can do whatever you want.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:50.720
But we need to play the intro for everybody so they know how to play it.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:59.720
The game sings to you to tell you how to play it.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:04.200
The whole tutorial is sung to you by the stupid little rabbit and the game's all vector, which

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.840
I think is pretty freaking fantastic.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:12.080
Well, not like true vector, but it's like a simple line and a line-drawing bunny that

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.720
you play as.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:22.080
The game was developed by Matsuura Masaya, who was the guy who brought us Parappa and

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.080
Umjiramalani.

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:31.440
Basically, Vibri, who is the main character, if you do badly, well, let me start off how

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.440
to play it.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.720
First of all, you've got obstacles that are in the way.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:40.360
You have a block or a loop or a wave or a pit.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:45.200
And you have to press a different button to bypass this as you're going along on basically

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.160
this continuous line.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:55.960
And the way that it goes is, you know, if you don't go over the obstacles by pressing

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.940
the right button, you will get hurt.

01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:04.120
And the more you get hurt, you change forms and you can turn from a rabbit into a frog

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.800
and then a worm and then you just die.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.880
However, if you do really well, you eventually turn into a fairy princess.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:15.360
Loki, this sounds like your kind of game.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.640
You can be a fairy princess.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.680
Oh yeah, totally.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.160
Right now.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:29.480
But the other thing about this is that there are six, I believe, no, there's a few songs

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:35.200
that are, yeah, six songs that are included in the game itself.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.400
However you can put in your own CDs and play whatever you want to, which we've tried to

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.720
do to like a whole bunch of old Beatmania stuff, but I found the best thing ever.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.600
Let me actually play this for you guys.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.640
I know this makes horrible radio when you can't actually see the video, but I think

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.940
you'll see why this is so epic when I load this here, what somebody actually did this

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.280
YouTube here.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:03.120
The username on YouTube is 725Natsuko and 725Natsuko put in a very familiar song in

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.400
the VIB ribbon.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:20.400
That's right, it's VIB ribbon to Dragon Force.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.400
And Dragon Force, of course, makes any game epic.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:29.400
Well, a little bit more as you go into this game, just a few more details, is that some

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.320
of your other obstacles are combinations of your basic core obstacles, so you have to

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.720
press the combination of the two buttons that would have been for the individual obstacle,

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.480
which is where I was getting hung up.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:44.600
And then you have different levels of gameplay where you'll have your obstacles coming at

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:52.760
you, but then as you go through harder levels, they'll cross over each other so you really

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.960
don't know, you know it's coming up, but you don't know that that's the next one.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:01.040
It's like the obstacles are coming towards you at different speeds, and you can also

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:05.280
play it straight forward, as in you're just staring at it across the screen, but as you

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:12.480
play harder levels, you're playing at it from different angles, so it gets quite a bit harder.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:18.640
And like I said, the guy that brought this out gave us Krappa and Umjumma Lamy, but there's

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.640
also sequels.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:25.280
There's Moja Ribbon, which I think I'm actually still going to pick up, but Moja Ribbon, you

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:31.520
basically are, it's almost like you're rapping, but you're playing kanji.

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.120
I played it once, it is fascinating.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.760
It's so different than Vib Ribbon.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.120
There's a third Vib Ribbon series.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.240
There's Vib Ripple that came out as well.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:49.120
Vib Ripple is supposed to be done with different images that are loaded into the game that

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.120
you play with.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:59.120
Also, there is talk of making a remake of Vib Ribbon for PS3 that will be out via the

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:05.520
PlayStation Network, and the quote is saying we're discussing the possibility of making

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:11.320
a downloadable version of Vib Ribbon for Sony, but I don't know yet, so that would be really

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.320
cool.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.120
And actually, this game came out in Japan and came out in Europe, but we never got it

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.120
in America.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:22.920
And it was so weird to see the intro in English when I looked at this YouTube, I was like,

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.400
oh yes, right, they got this game in Europe, because I've only ever played the Japanese

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.400
one that you had.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.560
That's why I linked it to you so that you could see, because it has this, and it's not

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.720
an exact translation, but I love Vibri.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.560
I love Vibri, okay, Vibri is great.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.560
Excellent stuff.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:43.440
Oh, and also when you get the high score in this game, he sings a little song to you.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:46.440
There should be a link up there of the song he sings when you get a high score, but it's

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:52.920
just this little dance that says, yay, you got a high score, let me serenade you.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920
This game is great.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.720
Look, he's a fairy princess now.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:00.400
A lovely dose of insanity courtesy of Dark Sakura from the ever-so-cracked-out, you've

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:04.480
got to check the searches on YouTube, look at the videos, it's awesome, Vib Ribbon, that's

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:09.120
V-I-B Ribbon is the name of the game, check that out.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.040
It's this week's Classic Game of the Week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.000
Good pick, Dark Sakura.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.280
Predictable, but good.

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.280
I approve.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280
It was a matter of time.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.800
I knew it was just a matter of time.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:23.080
All right, well, that's going to do it here for Orange Lounge Radio Part A, but we will

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:27.640
be back in a little while with more of Orange Lounge Radio on Part B of our podcast.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:30.320
