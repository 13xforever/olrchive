00:13.979 --> 00:17.123
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 9th, 2008, is Smash Bros.

00:17.163 --> 00:18.605
[SPEAKER_00]: malfunctioning on some Wii's?

00:19.045 --> 00:22.549
[SPEAKER_00]: More car and track information is released for Gran Turismo 5.

00:23.110 --> 00:26.034
[SPEAKER_00]: Spore gets a port to an unlikely gaming platform.

00:31.448 --> 00:36.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.210 --> 00:43.493
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and, wait for it, the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.913 --> 00:44.913
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:44.953 --> 00:48.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.075 --> 00:49.295
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

00:49.835 --> 00:50.575
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are you, Ms.

00:50.595 --> 00:50.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Summers?

00:51.275 --> 00:51.596
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaty.

00:52.056 --> 00:52.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaty?

00:52.976 --> 00:53.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, so meaty.

00:55.137 --> 00:56.417
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly are you eating tonight?

00:56.817 --> 01:00.779
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm eating a protein-style cheeseburger from In-N-Out.

01:01.192 --> 01:01.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, yum.

01:02.713 --> 01:04.074
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't my mic.

01:04.094 --> 01:05.015
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you have Loki's.

01:06.055 --> 01:06.496
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

01:07.116 --> 01:07.336
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.

01:08.137 --> 01:10.598
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the technical difficulties just couldn't end with last week.

01:10.618 --> 01:10.979
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel better.

01:11.179 --> 01:11.839
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there you go.

01:12.139 --> 01:12.960
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel complete now?

01:13.160 --> 01:13.440
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

01:13.921 --> 01:17.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well let me introduce Tech Master Loki real quick and then we'll talk about last week.

01:17.583 --> 01:20.205
[SPEAKER_03]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, now with proper mic.

01:20.505 --> 01:21.566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have the proper mic.

01:21.766 --> 01:22.386
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, Loki?

01:22.987 --> 01:23.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

01:23.547 --> 01:27.730
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just untangling the mic on the mixing board so I don't pull it and it turns all the knobs on there.

01:28.038 --> 01:28.939
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:52.233 --> 01:53.834
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:08.322 --> 02:09.743
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, Rebuttal Jamie, Rebuttal

02:37.396 --> 02:41.099
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki gets smacked with a large trout or whatever the old MIRC thing is.

02:41.619 --> 02:50.565
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, so yeah, we will release the kind of cruddy audio part B like on our Facebook and MySpace and all that stuff.

02:50.585 --> 02:53.787
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to get that up tomorrow just for those folks that really want to hear it.

02:54.567 --> 02:58.270
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, for the rest of you guys, it's just another broken show.

02:58.290 --> 02:58.770
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we say?

02:58.810 --> 03:01.612
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're hoping tonight is working.

03:02.132 --> 03:03.453
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back to our normal selves.

03:03.513 --> 03:04.293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new month.

03:05.034 --> 03:06.515
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather's getting warmer again.

03:07.510 --> 03:10.452
[SPEAKER_03]: We're off to a good start because the network is actually working the way it's supposed to.

03:10.472 --> 03:13.013
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have to jerry-rig a whole second network setup.

03:13.574 --> 03:18.297
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're hoping we are ready to talk games for our full Part A and Part B tonight.

03:18.337 --> 03:21.999
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will shut up and turn it over to DarkSakura who will talk about her gaming week.

03:23.760 --> 03:32.205
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was almost non-existent except for, of course, Ragnarok because I've been very busy trying to get a few things ready and had a few...

03:34.173 --> 03:37.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang-ups come in the way, but I think I'm going to actually be able to play more stuff next week.

03:39.896 --> 03:40.197
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

03:40.257 --> 03:41.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes real life gets in the way of gaming.

03:41.858 --> 03:42.358
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

03:42.698 --> 03:44.299
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people can't hold the controller.

03:46.000 --> 03:46.380
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

03:47.241 --> 03:47.541
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:48.281 --> 03:49.262
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then, Loki, we'll go to you.

03:49.302 --> 03:49.962
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

03:51.403 --> 03:51.903
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.

03:52.304 --> 03:58.987
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Orange Box on the PC because I have had it for a while and I haven't actually tried it.

03:59.888 --> 04:01.509
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks nice on the PC, but...

04:03.114 --> 04:06.856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly the same, so, you know.

04:07.396 --> 04:15.081
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, oh yeah, mainly Portal, because that's actually all I got, so, which is Portal.

04:16.261 --> 04:20.164
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've been playing a little bit of Smash Bros.

04:20.244 --> 04:20.584
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl.

04:20.644 --> 04:28.028
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like 30% way through the Subspace Emissary, so that's pretty fun.

04:30.049 --> 04:31.450
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, what else?

04:33.012 --> 04:37.034
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I may have played some Patapon, but that's about it.

04:37.434 --> 04:41.997
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me a little bit more about Patapon, because I was reading some stuff about it, and it actually sounds like something I kind of want to play.

04:42.237 --> 04:43.818
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds kind of cool.

04:43.958 --> 04:54.724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically, I mean, sort of, it's not really a rhythm music game, but you have to keep rhythm with these drums, and depending on what four-note sequence you play, they will do different things.

04:54.904 --> 05:00.867
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you have an attack sequence, you have march forward, retreat, that kind of stuff.

05:02.455 --> 05:07.156
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just kind of strategize with that and keep in time at the same time.

05:08.337 --> 05:20.120
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I did wasn't really playing games, but I got to view a lot of games, and that was we had our Eidos rep come out and talk to us a bit about the stuff that they covered during Destination PlayStation.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.942
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to see some really cool stuff, including an unreleased trailer for Tomb Raider Legends, or not Tomb Raider Legends, Tomb Raider Underworld,

05:30.106 --> 05:32.708
[SPEAKER_02]: with gameplay footage on it, and it looks awesome.

05:33.108 --> 05:33.848
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely awesome.

05:33.888 --> 05:37.451
[SPEAKER_02]: They did some new motion capturing for everything.

05:38.152 --> 05:38.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

05:40.433 --> 05:44.697
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon my skepticism, but I have failed to get excited about Tomb Raider in about 10 years.

05:44.837 --> 05:46.939
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about as awesome as Uncharted, maybe.

05:47.119 --> 05:47.459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

05:47.539 --> 05:52.243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that excited about Uncharted, but it really does look good.

05:52.603 --> 05:57.847
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get excited about Tomb Raider because it's just not my thing, but it looks good.

05:58.911 --> 05:59.251
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

05:59.612 --> 06:00.532
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't buy it though.

06:00.832 --> 06:03.434
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks good for people who like Tomb Raider.

06:03.614 --> 06:03.954
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me.

06:04.234 --> 06:05.015
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Tomb Raider.

06:05.455 --> 06:07.977
[SPEAKER_02]: I like throwing her off a cliff and killing her and that's about it.

06:09.218 --> 06:11.899
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure you can do that and it will look much nicer.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.821
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's it.

06:15.642 --> 06:16.723
[SPEAKER_02]: Other cool stuff I saw.

06:16.803 --> 06:17.443
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a game.

06:17.463 --> 06:19.664
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I get the title right.

06:20.665 --> 06:22.126
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's called Little Ninjas.

06:23.107 --> 06:24.207
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks really cool.

06:24.227 --> 06:28.130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a cross between almost like Okami and

06:29.537 --> 06:30.398
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know what else.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.659
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Pirates vs. Ninjas or something like that.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Volleyball or dodgeball or whatever.

06:36.002 --> 06:39.585
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cute little ninjas and they're fighting bad guys and stuff like that.

06:39.765 --> 06:41.826
[SPEAKER_02]: All kind of cel-shaded and it looks really neat.

06:42.827 --> 06:45.109
[SPEAKER_02]: So that will be coming out next year, unfortunately.

06:45.870 --> 06:51.294
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got to see some gameplay of the new Death Junior that they're doing for the Wii.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.555
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually looks pretty good.

06:53.575 --> 06:55.597
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it won't suck like the rest of them.

06:56.425 --> 06:57.825
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm pretty confident.

06:57.925 --> 07:01.126
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the one I was kind of excited about for the... Wait, wait, I have a quick question.

07:01.227 --> 07:02.207
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Death Jr.

07:02.227 --> 07:03.167
[SPEAKER_03]: was a Konami license.

07:03.227 --> 07:04.267
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is Eidos doing it now?

07:04.808 --> 07:05.448
[SPEAKER_02]: Different publisher.

07:05.688 --> 07:07.528
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the company-owned... Oh, gotcha.

07:07.568 --> 07:08.109
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry.

07:09.309 --> 07:09.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

07:09.809 --> 07:11.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami just published someone else's game.

07:11.830 --> 07:11.990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

07:12.010 --> 07:12.290
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

07:12.790 --> 07:14.130
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder why they decided not to do this one.

07:14.711 --> 07:15.091
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

07:15.251 --> 07:19.112
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the last two sucked for them, and they dropped the publisher, and Eidos picked them up.

07:19.132 --> 07:19.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

07:20.272 --> 07:25.574
[SPEAKER_02]: I also got to see some pretty cool footage of Gauntlet for the DS.

07:26.791 --> 07:27.611
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be cool.

07:28.372 --> 07:29.592
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they'd put it on live.

07:30.553 --> 07:34.674
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like a cross between the original Gauntlet and Gauntlet Legends.

07:36.695 --> 07:42.097
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still top-down, like the original Gauntlet, but it's all 3D and stuff, like Legends was.

07:42.497 --> 07:49.239
[SPEAKER_02]: The cool thing about it, though, four-player Wi-Fi co-op, and there's voice chat involved with that as well.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.280
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least they're doing that right.

07:51.660 --> 07:52.841
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be a pretty good purchase.

07:54.005 --> 07:57.646
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to catch up on some comments from chat room because we have lots of good stuff tonight.

07:58.707 --> 08:00.787
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to join us.

08:00.867 --> 08:05.809
[SPEAKER_03]: PKJr92 says, Uncharted is way better than Tomb Raider and you can kill him.

08:07.470 --> 08:09.630
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN says, Gauntlet DS equals sex.

08:09.770 --> 08:10.691
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make love to it.

08:11.611 --> 08:15.912
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, Too many gaming publications credit the publisher and not the developer.

08:15.972 --> 08:17.353
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're right, and I just made the same mistake.

08:17.393 --> 08:17.733
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

08:19.474 --> 08:19.754
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

08:21.892 --> 08:29.814
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other cool stuff I was unaware of, like the series and stuff, like Shellshock 2 they showed us, which I guess that's like a survivor horror game set in NOM.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.415
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like condemned in NOM, I guess.

08:33.635 --> 08:35.976
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, what other cool stuff?

08:36.836 --> 08:40.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's this other Looney Tunes game that was a complete ripoff of Elite Beat Agents.

08:40.237 --> 08:43.118
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, completely a ripoff of Elite Beat Agents.

08:43.458 --> 08:44.898
[SPEAKER_02]: Except, I don't know about the music though.

08:44.918 --> 08:47.599
[SPEAKER_02]: The music is like out of Looney Tunes, so it's all that orchestrated stuff.

08:48.288 --> 09:00.074
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Not necessarily that, but I think it did look kind of hard, but it's exactly like Elite Beat Agents.

09:00.355 --> 09:03.556
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you play Elite Beat Agents, this will be easy for you.

09:05.057 --> 09:06.038
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty much it.

09:06.218 --> 09:07.118
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my game week.

09:07.278 --> 09:17.404
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of exciting, though, to get to see everything, and I got to talk to her, but she offered us, well, at least me and my co-worker, to go tour Eidos, but...

09:18.254 --> 09:20.396
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll see if I can drag other people along.

09:20.436 --> 09:23.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't they make you sign all kinds of papers where you can't talk about it here, though?

09:24.179 --> 09:31.104
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're just like, she was talking about, for example, showing us storyboards for Tomb Raider and stuff like that.

09:31.144 --> 09:31.805
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

09:32.305 --> 09:32.666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.628
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this stuff is, all this stuff was pretty much announced.

09:35.688 --> 09:39.751
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you know, I don't have the trailer for Tomb Raider Underworld or anything like that.

09:40.232 --> 09:41.893
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the stuff that wasn't shown.

09:42.193 --> 09:46.237
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, kind of shown behind closed doors type thing, but I don't know.

09:46.257 --> 09:47.177
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty good.

09:47.538 --> 09:47.898
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just

09:49.228 --> 09:56.253
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Cause 2 looks exciting, but I like the first one, so looking forward to those Grand Theft Auto type of games.

09:56.393 --> 09:59.535
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like there's a lot coming out for you.

09:59.676 --> 10:01.117
[SPEAKER_02]: Good fourth quarter for them.

10:01.337 --> 10:08.602
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good, because Eidos, in the past, it's been a rough ride.

10:08.622 --> 10:09.402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a rough ride?

10:09.743 --> 10:09.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

10:10.023 --> 10:10.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.624
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to see them getting back on track.

10:11.977 --> 10:15.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Jamie, I got a question for you, because I know you're a fan of Elite Beat Agents, right?

10:15.659 --> 10:15.819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

10:15.839 --> 10:19.141
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about the whole Looney Tunes franchise completely knocking it off?

10:19.801 --> 10:20.601
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's stupid.

10:21.382 --> 10:22.002
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's stupid?

10:22.162 --> 10:22.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much of a good thing?

10:24.383 --> 10:25.444
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a copy of a copy?

10:26.124 --> 10:30.026
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that if they were going to do something, it would be better for them to do something original.

10:31.047 --> 10:31.467
[SPEAKER_03]: But who knows?

10:31.507 --> 10:34.809
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously, it can't be just a straight-up rip-off, right, Loki?

10:34.849 --> 10:36.529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to have some original stuff in it.

10:36.709 --> 10:41.652
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, what it does is recreates the different cartoons, like very famous cartoon scenes or whatever.

10:42.290 --> 10:45.271
[SPEAKER_02]: and so you're playing the music though with, you know, the cartoon.

10:45.772 --> 10:46.492
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that might actually be kind of neat.

10:49.894 --> 10:58.058
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you got like the whole thing going on there where the cartoon's going on, that's kind of, I mean, because The Leaping Ages is kind of like that in a way, but, you know, it's different.

10:58.078 --> 11:00.239
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of, it controls exactly the same.

11:00.279 --> 11:06.682
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you looked at the interface and how, like, the different spots where you tap and stuff, it looks exactly the same.

11:07.082 --> 11:07.642
[SPEAKER_02]: And who knows?

11:07.882 --> 11:09.043
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't looked at the developer.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's the same developer.

11:10.564 --> 11:10.964
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

11:11.485 --> 11:15.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, GS68 in our chat room, chat.orangenlaunchradio.com, sums it up.

11:15.932 --> 11:18.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Looney Tunes, Owen Don, do not want.

11:19.343 --> 11:19.924
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

11:42.043 --> 11:42.844
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Smash Bros Brawl

11:58.633 --> 12:01.134
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, goddamn, I'm having a lot of fun with Super Smash.

12:01.154 --> 12:06.117
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that I can actually understand it, as opposed to the Japanese version, like, you know, what's going on, I'm having a lot of fun.

12:06.297 --> 12:09.479
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I do think is interesting is that whole, uh, subspace emissary mode.

12:09.779 --> 12:15.282
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously I don't want to spoil a whole lot of what's going on, but I think what's interesting is that the cutscenes use no dialogue whatsoever.

12:15.722 --> 12:17.703
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no dialogue whatsoever in the cutscenes.

12:17.783 --> 12:22.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is more of an emotional reaction, you know, or it's, it's, everything is, there's no words.

12:23.464 --> 12:24.865
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:53.228 --> 12:55.649
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to do a Mario game just like this on the GameCube.

12:55.669 --> 12:56.629
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course they never did.

12:57.369 --> 12:58.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

12:58.730 --> 13:00.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper Mario on the Wii is kind of rad.

13:00.430 --> 13:00.770
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that.

13:00.810 --> 13:01.210
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

13:01.831 --> 13:05.272
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, just seeing what they did with the single player mode here and really making it a game.

13:05.292 --> 13:07.872
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not like the greatest single player game ever.

13:08.293 --> 13:12.214
[SPEAKER_03]: And you sort of have to really suspend disbelief to make the story work.

13:12.534 --> 13:16.455
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they really did kind of have to put all these characters in a blender and kind of pull a story out of their butts.

13:16.915 --> 13:17.675
[SPEAKER_03]: But it works.

13:18.055 --> 13:22.097
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets... It does the fanboy service.

13:22.277 --> 13:22.957
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really...

13:23.410 --> 13:28.137
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what this game is all about and I'll tell you what it's it's very comprehensive fanboy service because not only do you have all these

13:28.493 --> 13:36.039
[SPEAKER_03]: These characters, you have all the stickers, which, I mean, like, I think I got a sticker today for Mouser, one of the bosses in Super Mario 2.

13:36.419 --> 13:38.641
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's some, like, obscure shit in those things.

13:38.661 --> 13:43.245
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was getting things from Advance Wars I'd never even heard of, because I didn't play a lot of that series.

13:43.425 --> 13:46.368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just Nintendo fanboy wet dream, this game is.

13:46.508 --> 13:49.971
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what, even if you're not, like, a Super Nintendo fanboy, it's a great party game.

13:50.231 --> 13:54.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, duh, it's a Wii game, and the Wii has a lot of great party games, and this is no exception.

13:54.815 --> 13:56.496
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was playing a little bit, three players...

13:56.860 --> 13:57.641
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

14:22.074 --> 14:25.495
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to point out that we have a friend code thread over on our forums.

14:25.535 --> 14:34.398
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to add everybody on there later today and try to maybe bring out Justin TV this evening and try to fight some folks, Orange Launch Radio listeners.

14:34.698 --> 14:40.220
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and we can use my map if I can swap it with somebody because, you know, I made a cool map.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.421
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Cage Match.

14:42.861 --> 14:43.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, nice.

14:43.581 --> 14:44.322
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what you did there.

14:44.982 --> 14:45.242
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

14:46.066 --> 14:48.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see, what else do I want to talk about my game of the week?

14:48.949 --> 15:02.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quickly, I want to mention Triggerheart Excelica, because I think a lot of people, like, totally skipped this game, because it was an Xbox Live Arcade release, but I'll tell you what, if you like your Japanese shooters, this is as cliche of a Japanese shooter as they come.

15:02.522 --> 15:03.023
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is...

15:03.363 --> 15:03.683
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

15:33.763 --> 15:34.444
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.

15:34.984 --> 15:36.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever heard of this one, Trigger Heart Accelica?

15:36.725 --> 15:36.945
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

15:37.865 --> 15:38.346
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good time.

15:38.386 --> 15:44.829
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like that, I was going to say in April there's Castle of Shikigami 3 is coming out on the Wii.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.910
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be another good one.

15:47.450 --> 15:49.832
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's definitely worth a look, Trigger Heart Accelica.

15:50.152 --> 15:52.893
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not spend the money on the full purchase, but I might later on.

15:53.433 --> 15:58.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm kind of at the point with Xbox 360 arcade games where either I'm going to buy the damn thing when it comes right out

15:58.752 --> 16:04.634
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to buy it, or I'm going to wait for them to do a price reduction, because now they've shown that they're willing to do that later.

16:04.654 --> 16:06.695
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a bunch of tracks on Rock Band this week.

16:07.555 --> 16:07.855
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what?

16:08.015 --> 16:17.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I, well, I bought a bunch of the older stuff, because I wanted some other, I left it in my work now, and we have it all set up there so we can play it anytime.

16:17.759 --> 16:26.282
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually buying the official, like, well, someone made them, their official, like, drum, you know, silencer thing, so the drums aren't so

16:27.765 --> 16:30.366
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried making my own out of mouse pads.

16:31.526 --> 16:36.627
[SPEAKER_02]: The funny thing about mouse pads is they soak up super glue pretty easy, so it doesn't stick very well.

16:37.948 --> 16:43.189
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm ripping those off and then trying these official ones out.

16:43.389 --> 16:51.531
[SPEAKER_02]: Because while they stuck, they were working pretty good, but after you hit them about 20 times, they fell right off.

16:52.951 --> 16:53.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.

16:57.583 --> 16:57.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

17:00.005 --> 17:03.388
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my gaming week that I want to talk about.

17:03.408 --> 17:03.968
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there is.

17:04.048 --> 17:04.769
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really it.

17:05.470 --> 17:07.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously Smash Brothers took a large chunk of my time.

17:07.551 --> 17:11.174
[SPEAKER_03]: As I'm sure for many of you out there who own a Wii, it's taking up a lot of your time as well.

17:11.214 --> 17:14.637
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the demos that they have for the virtual console games.

17:15.217 --> 17:19.621
[SPEAKER_02]: I laugh though because they show you how long the demo is for each one.

17:20.109 --> 17:21.411
[SPEAKER_02]: Ice Climbers, 40 seconds.

17:21.451 --> 17:22.952
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you get to play of Ice Climbers.

17:23.593 --> 17:25.636
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do a lot in 40 seconds in Ice Climbers.

17:25.856 --> 17:27.318
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 seconds is long enough to beat the first level.

17:28.379 --> 17:30.281
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the demos were a nice touch.

17:30.561 --> 17:32.243
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of hoping you would unlock more.

17:32.323 --> 17:33.104
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you do yet.

17:33.705 --> 17:33.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

17:34.025 --> 17:34.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

17:34.466 --> 17:35.267
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I haven't seen...

17:35.674 --> 17:37.895
[SPEAKER_03]: because one of my friends marathoned it last night.

17:37.915 --> 17:39.235
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen if he unlocked anything else.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.756
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine you have to unlock a couple others.

17:40.776 --> 17:46.498
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to look at my Japanese one, too, because I've got, I think, Mother 2 or Mother 3.

17:47.598 --> 17:49.459
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Mother 3, but Mother 2, I think, is on there.

17:49.639 --> 17:49.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

17:50.499 --> 17:52.760
[SPEAKER_03]: That may be cool because that means we might have Earthbound on ours.

17:53.240 --> 17:53.460
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

17:53.900 --> 17:54.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

17:54.380 --> 17:55.821
[SPEAKER_02]: That was exclusive for Japan.

17:55.981 --> 17:56.281
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

17:56.921 --> 17:58.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we should get something exclusive.

17:58.462 --> 17:59.442
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not fair.

17:59.462 --> 18:01.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

18:01.563 --> 18:01.843
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

18:02.969 --> 18:03.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid!

18:04.790 --> 18:08.512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of shown, though, that they can do a virtual console demo.

18:09.133 --> 18:11.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Time limited, but it works, right?

18:11.294 --> 18:12.614
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're just assholes, that's all.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.345
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's see.

18:18.405 --> 18:21.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to tonight's housekeeping before we get to tonight's news.

18:21.248 --> 18:24.571
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I already said the one thing I wanted to say on housekeeping tonight.

18:24.871 --> 18:29.075
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a friend code thread going on on the forums at orangelaunchradio.com.

18:29.455 --> 18:34.880
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be having some OL Army tournaments and things like that because lots of people love Smash Brothers.

18:35.220 --> 18:36.762
[SPEAKER_03]: I know lots of our listeners are into this series.

18:36.802 --> 18:38.103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure tons of you have picked up the game.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.245
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out at orangelaunchradio.com.

18:40.285 --> 18:40.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on the forums.

18:41.624 --> 18:44.125
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can probably get 64 friend codes on that list.

18:44.185 --> 18:50.328
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure if you are adding people on Brawl that you're also adding them on your system in case we want to swap levels around.

18:50.668 --> 19:07.255
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as far as I'm aware, I'm not sure if you can drop them onto the SD memory cards, but I don't know if those things are linked to a certain system or not because Nintendo is an asshole, so they really don't want anything to work correctly, so

19:08.109 --> 19:08.790
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

19:27.682 --> 19:31.785
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN wants me to plug something he's doing too, which is the OLR March Madness.

19:32.085 --> 19:35.227
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking more about that during the live-only bonus segment tonight.

19:35.587 --> 19:43.692
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to participate in choosing the best video game of all time, as chosen by our listeners, check out our forums as well in the STFU forum.

19:43.732 --> 19:47.754
[SPEAKER_03]: That's DMN's show, and there's more information on how you can send your votes in and all that good stuff.

19:49.175 --> 19:50.756
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we ready to get into some gaming news?

19:51.456 --> 19:51.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

19:52.037 --> 19:52.897
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I think so.

19:52.917 --> 19:54.198
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you start us off, Loki?

19:54.887 --> 19:58.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this isn't a big surprise, because the same thing happened in Japan when Smash Bros.

19:58.550 --> 19:59.531
[SPEAKER_02]: was released there.

20:00.471 --> 20:03.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Wii systems are having trouble reading Smash Bros.

20:03.914 --> 20:22.528
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl, because, first off, it's the first dual-layer disc for, or dual-layer Wii game on the system, and there was an update, I believe, on the disc to update your system to be able to play those dual-layer discs, and because of that, you know, it takes a little bit more, I guess...

20:23.058 --> 20:34.932
[SPEAKER_02]: Refine Laser to see the data on the disc and they're claiming that some of the Wii systems are kind of dusty and dirty so they will not be able to play Brawl.

20:35.873 --> 20:43.182
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you run into that problem you're supposed to send your system in to Nintendo and they will fix the problem or clean your disc.

20:43.832 --> 20:44.774
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive or something like that.

20:44.934 --> 20:47.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Vacuum out the insides of your Wii or something.

20:47.659 --> 20:48.641
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to that effect.

20:48.881 --> 20:52.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there might be any... I mean, you're the type of... You're a homebrew kind of guy.

20:52.507 --> 20:56.254
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there's any home remedies that someone could try that... Now, obviously, you know...

20:56.874 --> 20:58.194
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't void your warranty or whatever.

20:59.655 --> 21:03.376
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody out there happens to be getting this problem, is there anything they could try that wouldn't damage their Wii?

21:03.596 --> 21:05.637
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be hard because that disk drive is kind of funky.

21:06.377 --> 21:08.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a CD cleaner or something like that.

21:08.998 --> 21:10.459
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a DVD cleaner.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.019
[SPEAKER_03]: How effective are those CD cleaner things?

21:12.079 --> 21:16.201
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just basically a CD with brushes on it.

21:16.221 --> 21:17.641
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I was just thinking?

21:17.661 --> 21:19.122
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the Wii even play CDs?

21:19.422 --> 21:20.142
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't, does it?

21:20.803 --> 21:21.063
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

21:22.783 --> 21:23.784
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I was thinking that.

21:23.804 --> 21:24.764
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of like, I don't think it

21:26.804 --> 21:27.124
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

21:28.485 --> 21:30.366
[SPEAKER_02]: My system wasn't dusty at all.

21:30.466 --> 21:35.029
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, to be honest, there isn't really a lot of places for it to get dusty.

21:35.069 --> 21:36.851
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that drive isn't really open that much.

21:36.891 --> 21:38.912
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just there's, you know, kind of.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.866
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:04.212 --> 22:06.114
[SPEAKER_01]: You bust it open and take a shot back after it.

22:06.594 --> 22:09.436
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, there isn't a whole lot of intake.

22:10.037 --> 22:23.108
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a tiny little fan in that thing anyways, and I don't really see how there could be a lot of dust sitting on your laser unless you're putting in discs that have been sitting out in the air and just like are caked with dust and you throw it in your system.

22:23.388 --> 22:24.629
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that's your own damn fault.

22:24.810 --> 22:29.754
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, it's probably your own damn fault that they don't play, so that's...

22:30.236 --> 22:32.458
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to mention this comment in chat.

22:32.498 --> 22:38.883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely random, but when you talk about smoke, I couldn't help but think about the Rock Band Stage Kit.

22:57.384 --> 22:58.085
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

23:20.885 --> 23:23.147
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it's able to work with both systems.

23:23.187 --> 23:30.772
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I want to get some of my ABBA karaoke CDs and put them on my CD player and use the Rock Band Stage Kit to do like an epic version of Chiquiquita, I could do that?

23:31.052 --> 23:31.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.

23:31.753 --> 23:32.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

23:36.619 --> 23:41.522
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, also, speaking of epic on your Wii, we love it when new channels come out for the Wii.

23:41.582 --> 23:43.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad this wasn't for us, it's for the folks in Japan.

23:43.983 --> 23:47.806
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Teribi Notomo channel, that would be TV Friend.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.247
[SPEAKER_03]: The TV Friend channel came out on the Wii this week.

23:50.307 --> 23:55.270
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically, like, imagine the TV Guide channel on American TV, that's kind of what they're getting on the Wii.

23:55.770 --> 24:03.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Hence why they say it may not come out here, because of the fact that, you know, here in America, on your cable, you already have a TV Guide channel.

24:03.615 --> 24:04.175
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pretty cool, though.

24:04.195 --> 24:05.876
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we have TV Guide and all that stuff.

24:06.571 --> 24:10.274
[SPEAKER_03]: and plus now with TiVo and cables got it built in.

24:10.294 --> 24:18.940
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about this though that was really cool at least from the video that I saw of it is that you can look at multiple days so you can see what's on a whole week.

24:19.160 --> 24:27.166
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually some of those you have to kind of keep progressing hour by hour and kind of move along the thing to see what's on the next day and stuff like that.

24:27.526 --> 24:33.410
[SPEAKER_02]: This you can be like a whole 3D thing and it'll turn it to the side and you can select different days out and stuff like that.

24:33.470 --> 24:33.890
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

24:34.631 --> 24:35.832
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it have a globe I can spin?

24:36.693 --> 24:37.713
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:00.228 --> 25:02.149
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that it's necessary.

25:02.649 --> 25:04.810
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that they have it over there, but we don't really need it here.

25:04.830 --> 25:08.032
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be neat, but... Couldn't you say the same thing about the news channel, though?

25:08.992 --> 25:10.113
[SPEAKER_03]: And the forecast channel, really?

25:10.473 --> 25:16.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that you can get all that shit on the internet, or you can watch the nightly news, or you can, I don't know, read a newspaper.

25:17.676 --> 25:19.397
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on what you use more.

25:20.958 --> 25:21.458
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.599
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the other cool thing you can do with this?

25:23.839 --> 25:23.979
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

25:25.365 --> 25:30.609
[SPEAKER_02]: When you find your channel or whatever, you can actually use your Wii Remote as a universal remote with your TV.

25:32.730 --> 25:35.152
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to get to that, but that's alright.

25:35.633 --> 25:37.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Wii Remote is going to be like a universal remote.

25:37.734 --> 25:40.697
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also change channels, do the volume and all that stuff.

25:40.717 --> 25:42.458
[SPEAKER_03]: You can switch between Wii and TV inputs.

25:43.219 --> 25:46.321
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's some type of hack that you use with the sensor bar.

25:47.542 --> 25:52.967
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I think what it does is it... I don't know if it causes the...

25:54.449 --> 25:54.689
[SPEAKER_02]: I.R.

25:54.709 --> 25:57.670
[SPEAKER_02]: to bounce off of the sensor bar and bounce off your head or something like that.

25:57.710 --> 26:00.551
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I say hack, it's an official Nintendo thing.

26:00.591 --> 26:03.091
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like people are hacking their systems to do it.

26:03.171 --> 26:04.432
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Nintendo-endorsed hack.

26:04.932 --> 26:09.973
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat, though, that they're hacking their own stuff to do weird purposes.

26:10.233 --> 26:13.054
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why that strikes me as so amusing, but it does.

26:13.614 --> 26:14.214
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

26:15.055 --> 26:23.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, what's kind of interesting, you can stamp programs that you're interested in, and then you can share them with either other Wii users or you can send them to Wii Friends.

26:25.038 --> 26:28.381
[SPEAKER_03]: and Nintendo calculates popularity scores based on what's been bookmarked.

26:29.101 --> 26:30.342
[SPEAKER_03]: So, kind of interesting.

26:30.703 --> 26:40.670
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like the fact that they are kind of trying to turn the Wii into a one-stop shop, even though news and forecast and TV and all that is something you can get on the computer anyway.

26:41.111 --> 26:44.253
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think it's a neat idea to have it all right there on your TV.

26:44.713 --> 26:45.414
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

26:45.594 --> 26:50.938
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I know it's something that's available out there right now and other things, but it's free.

26:51.198 --> 26:54.541
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, even if you don't use it, it's at least there for you.

26:55.582 --> 26:56.563
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the news channel.

26:56.683 --> 27:00.865
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't read it at all, but if you want to, you can.

27:03.206 --> 27:07.509
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better, too, to have more stuff to fill your little blank TV screens with on your Wii.

27:07.549 --> 27:09.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't that feel good, to fill in those screens?

27:10.190 --> 27:13.892
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm almost out of memory on my Wii system.

27:13.992 --> 27:15.313
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens when we run out of space?

27:15.473 --> 27:17.414
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you only get four screens to play with.

27:17.514 --> 27:20.996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm seriously, I probably have maybe ten screens left.

27:21.076 --> 27:21.336
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

27:21.356 --> 27:21.476
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

27:21.803 --> 27:28.465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you have to delete stuff, and then when you run out of space on the actual unit, you have to put stuff on SD memory cards.

27:28.485 --> 27:31.586
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you anything Nintendo is going to do something about the memory space this winter.

27:31.626 --> 27:33.686
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to for all this WiiWare stuff coming out.

27:33.706 --> 27:34.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

27:34.247 --> 27:35.487
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

27:35.547 --> 27:37.147
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're stubborn bastards.

27:37.167 --> 27:37.668
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't do it.

27:37.828 --> 27:40.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Frisbee says external hard drive channel.

27:41.169 --> 27:43.189
[SPEAKER_03]: External hard drive channel.

27:44.270 --> 27:44.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.811
[SPEAKER_03]: The SD card management channel, even though it's in the system.

27:48.131 --> 27:49.291
[SPEAKER_03]: But something that can just...

27:50.217 --> 27:55.499
[SPEAKER_03]: It would not be that hard to have the Wii read off the SD card just like it does its own internal memory.

28:04.056 --> 28:05.036
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:33.047 --> 28:36.770
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's what the Wii Shop channel feels like, is Prodigy Online.

28:36.790 --> 28:38.151
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, low blow.

28:38.451 --> 28:38.791
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.874
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know a true story about Prodigy?

28:43.394 --> 28:43.674
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

28:43.734 --> 28:45.496
[SPEAKER_03]: Prodigy's where it all started for me, dude.

28:45.516 --> 28:48.298
[SPEAKER_03]: If I did not have Prodigy, this show would not exist.

28:48.458 --> 28:51.520
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my first gateway drug to the internet, was Prodigy.

28:51.620 --> 28:52.581
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Prodigy.

28:54.802 --> 28:58.905
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have on the forums, I actually had a Nintendo Help thread, and I would help

28:59.451 --> 29:00.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Prodigy Chat Prodigy Chat

29:24.963 --> 29:25.063
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

29:25.083 --> 29:25.163
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

29:25.183 --> 29:25.263
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

29:25.523 --> 29:25.623
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.902
[SPEAKER_03]: No, AOL was always kind of the devil to people on Prodigy.

29:53.302 --> 29:59.567
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anyone wants to know who I was, I was CNW Allura for the Cartoon Network chat back in the day.

29:59.967 --> 30:03.489
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think someone's honestly going to listen to this and be all like, I remember her?

30:04.090 --> 30:04.890
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, watch.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.291
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a whole bunch on that.

30:06.631 --> 30:07.112
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't care.

30:07.132 --> 30:07.992
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows it was me?

30:09.733 --> 30:13.836
[SPEAKER_03]: Dartitsuya in chat says, Sky, you wanted to grow up to be a Nintendo game counselor?

30:14.176 --> 30:18.720
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, wasn't that like all of our dreams in junior high school until we realized...

30:19.699 --> 30:21.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Never have that dream.

30:22.421 --> 30:22.721
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

30:23.281 --> 30:25.563
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can play video games for a living.

30:27.044 --> 30:28.324
[SPEAKER_03]: And get paid for it.

30:29.345 --> 30:29.865
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

30:32.147 --> 30:33.287
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go ahead.

30:33.327 --> 30:35.369
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to help stupid people get through the game.

30:35.669 --> 30:36.730
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I get more?

30:36.990 --> 30:39.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Push the A button.

30:40.872 --> 30:41.893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not working.

30:42.133 --> 30:43.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn on your system.

30:43.654 --> 30:45.475
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet there were some real dopes that called in.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.155
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

30:46.696 --> 30:47.016
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

30:47.831 --> 30:55.737
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for more Wii news and not AOL or Prodigy, which we, you know, we called, um, never mind.

30:56.338 --> 30:59.200
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that we are on the cutting edge of technology here on this show.

30:59.581 --> 31:00.761
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, Prodigy?

31:03.163 --> 31:03.404
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry?

31:04.925 --> 31:05.625
[SPEAKER_01]: CompuSuck.

31:06.526 --> 31:07.767
[SPEAKER_01]: And any people who use that.

31:10.527 --> 31:15.730
[SPEAKER_01]: Okami Wii is actually getting a later release date than was anticipated.

31:16.150 --> 31:19.572
[SPEAKER_01]: They originally said March 25th, but it's going to be April 15th.

31:20.752 --> 31:22.413
[SPEAKER_01]: So get ready to play it then.

31:23.394 --> 31:25.275
[SPEAKER_01]: Capcom doesn't really want to tell us why.

31:29.657 --> 31:29.777
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

31:30.017 --> 31:32.259
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like there isn't a version of Okami already out there.

31:32.819 --> 31:35.000
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a little wait won't kill anybody.

31:36.186 --> 31:39.868
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you why it's not coming out on the 25th, because it's not done.

31:40.169 --> 31:40.589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

31:41.670 --> 31:49.155
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, you know what, you know why games get delayed, surprisingly, they fail QA, or they fail the little seal of approval check and all that stuff.

31:49.315 --> 31:51.076
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the seal of approval of anything.

31:51.116 --> 31:59.642
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but, no, these games, don't the games have to be okay, like, Xbox 360 games have to go through, like, a Microsoft certification process, Nintendo games have to go through something similar, maybe it failed.

32:00.042 --> 32:00.462
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

32:00.482 --> 32:01.003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

32:01.463 --> 32:06.166
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean they actually put these, like, shitty Destiny games through that same, you know, Nintendo seal of approval?

32:06.286 --> 32:06.969
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

32:12.944 --> 32:13.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.

32:14.165 --> 32:19.467
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard of the fact that sometimes gaming companies say they don't want these games to come out on their system.

32:19.507 --> 32:20.368
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of that happening.

32:20.648 --> 32:28.492
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing is that for every Xbox game, you have to refer to the little X button as the guide button.

32:28.572 --> 32:31.053
[SPEAKER_03]: Your A's have to be colored like the A button and all that stuff.

32:31.093 --> 32:33.234
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody actually goes through and makes sure the game is compliant.

32:33.455 --> 32:38.137
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bet you anything with Okami, somebody missed something and a PlayStation 2 character came over and they had to go back and fix it.

32:38.397 --> 32:41.039
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm glad that they fixed those little details.

32:41.079 --> 32:49.903
[SPEAKER_03]: I have absolutely nothing to back that up, but sometimes these are why games get unexpectedly delayed, and if they're not saying anything about it, you never know.

32:50.123 --> 32:50.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

32:50.984 --> 32:52.625
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, eh.

32:53.325 --> 32:56.507
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing coming out in April anyways, at least not in the first half.

32:57.361 --> 32:58.241
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the only thing.

32:58.541 --> 33:01.822
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the top title of the first half of April now.

33:02.062 --> 33:06.963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going over to chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and just a completely random comment kind of out of thin air.

33:07.003 --> 33:08.223
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it must have been on another topic.

33:08.723 --> 33:12.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Gripper01 in chat says, I'm stuck on the second boss on Lost Odyssey.

33:12.304 --> 33:12.724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.

33:13.124 --> 33:15.884
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lost Odyssey does have some pretty tough bosses in it.

33:15.904 --> 33:21.265
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what's really funny is like you'll notice in my gaming week, as much of a love fest as I was having with Lost Odyssey last week, I didn't even play it.

33:21.305 --> 33:22.145
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't touch it this week.

33:22.565 --> 33:26.406
[SPEAKER_03]: My roommate comes up to me yesterday and goes, did you stop playing Lost Odyssey?

33:27.392 --> 33:28.132
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:57.259 --> 34:00.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you just have to keep casting spells against it.

34:00.103 --> 34:03.547
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's based on fire, so water spells maybe?

34:04.788 --> 34:05.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

34:06.130 --> 34:07.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, water spells.

34:07.291 --> 34:07.892
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.435
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after you kill the first one, there's a second one that comes.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.220
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, let's go ahead and move on with the news.

34:15.834 --> 34:16.154
[SPEAKER_02]: Spectator Mode

34:45.203 --> 35:00.110
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as there's going to be some other cool stuff you can do like being able to download ghost data, daily missions, kind of like the mission mode in Mario Kart DS, and what else?

35:00.211 --> 35:00.791
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

35:03.092 --> 35:04.133
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

35:04.453 --> 35:08.575
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the fact that you can do spectator mode while you're waiting for races and stuff.

35:08.595 --> 35:09.115
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

35:11.713 --> 35:16.877
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's interesting, Nintendo's strategy here, to create a whole separate channel kind of dedicated to one of their games.

35:16.957 --> 35:18.238
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think it's kind of a neat idea.

35:19.479 --> 35:19.699
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

35:19.799 --> 35:28.846
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you gotta hand it to Nintendo at least for this much, is that as pretty rad as the Xbox 360 is with its online stuff, it doesn't have a lot like this.

35:29.086 --> 35:30.107
[SPEAKER_03]: With the exception of

35:30.894 --> 35:37.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff like Halo 3 that has their very comprehensive website with obscenely detailed game statistics.

35:38.260 --> 35:41.243
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat to see Nintendo doing something actually integrated on the Wii.

35:41.503 --> 35:42.043
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat.

35:42.203 --> 35:47.068
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't do something integrated on the whole system.

35:47.228 --> 35:51.131
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if each one of these games has another channel that adds on to it.

35:51.718 --> 35:55.200
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine with me, because I'm not playing like 20 games at a time.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.462
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially the AAA titles, you know, that you know tons of people are getting.

35:58.702 --> 36:08.407
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what you guys have heard about the midnight launches from around the country, but just looking at some of the various gaming blogs, talking to one of my friends that was working at one of the stores, it sounds like packed.

36:08.548 --> 36:10.929
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like these midnight sales are absolutely packed for Smash Bros.

36:12.120 --> 36:23.527
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Dan, of course you know my husband manages a game, Crazy, and he was saying that what was packed was the tournament he ran and not so much the midnight sale.

36:24.388 --> 36:26.789
[SPEAKER_03]: So people were just going for the tournament and didn't even bother to buy the game?

36:27.370 --> 36:27.710
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.

36:27.950 --> 36:28.491
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.

36:30.052 --> 36:30.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

36:31.052 --> 36:32.333
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he'll pick it up eventually.

36:32.633 --> 36:34.895
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it really thinned out when it came time for the launch.

36:35.555 --> 36:35.815
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

36:36.376 --> 36:37.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was past all their bedtimes.

36:37.676 --> 36:38.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're coming back today.

36:39.204 --> 36:39.544
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

36:39.564 --> 36:44.286
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just say it doesn't matter what time they do a launch, pre-order your copy, you'll get it.

36:45.066 --> 36:45.266
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

36:45.306 --> 36:50.688
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they didn't have money at the time, maybe they're just waiting to pick it up later on, because, I mean, it's not like it's going to be hard to find, I don't think.

36:50.828 --> 36:54.069
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate calling it pre-ordering, because really you're just reserving.

36:54.769 --> 36:55.529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a deposit.

36:55.669 --> 36:56.009
[SPEAKER_01]: Ordering.

36:56.309 --> 36:57.410
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, reserve your copy.

36:57.930 --> 37:01.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's Have Tea says, there were over 300 kids at the one I went to.

37:02.071 --> 37:06.172
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, I was at the GameStop in Santa Clara this morning and the line was going around the store.

37:07.553 --> 37:07.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

37:09.804 --> 37:12.147
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've got some good stuff coming up, you know, with Mario Kart next.

37:12.167 --> 37:13.589
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not a bad thing to follow.

37:27.659 --> 37:28.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Survival Horror Puzzler

37:42.170 --> 37:42.670
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

37:59.830 --> 38:01.171
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's being made for WiiWare.

38:01.251 --> 38:08.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Lit is going to be about this character Jake and he's trapped in a high school and there's evil creatures all around the high school and he's trying to find his girlfriend Rachel.

38:09.276 --> 38:12.238
[SPEAKER_03]: This is WayForward's first original IP since Shantae.

38:13.199 --> 38:19.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Lit is going to have horror elements, boss battles and the developers are expecting this to be a big game.

38:20.244 --> 38:21.865
[SPEAKER_03]: And the concept art looks kind of neat.

38:23.722 --> 38:31.347
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious how a survival horror puzzler plays out, but those are two of my favorite genres, so the marriage of them can't be entirely a bad thing, right Jamie?

38:31.708 --> 38:36.991
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna have cutscenes where you walk through and you meet a zombie that says, hey, let's puzzle to get past this door.

38:37.011 --> 38:39.793
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in Kirby's Avalanche.

38:39.873 --> 38:40.934
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like Puzzle Quest.

38:41.935 --> 38:43.616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like playing Puyo Puyo.

38:44.502 --> 38:51.085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, as if, you know, a puzzle quest survivor horror game, I'm sure would be well accepted.

38:51.286 --> 38:54.307
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wait, how would, like, Resident Evil puzzler work?

38:54.347 --> 38:57.949
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, solve this puzzle, or a chainsaw man's gonna come after you?

38:57.969 --> 38:58.950
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Puzzle Pirates.

39:01.585 --> 39:02.885
[SPEAKER_01]: Silly Rob, there's no chainsaw.

39:03.025 --> 39:03.805
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is, isn't there?

39:03.986 --> 39:04.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hello.

39:04.786 --> 39:06.206
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the scariest guy in the game.

39:06.246 --> 39:09.627
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy with the chainsaw on the first stage that runs up to you and just chops your head right off.

39:09.647 --> 39:17.348
[SPEAKER_02]: They should totally make another puzzle fighter game and just throw in characters from Resident Evil in there and you can have a chainsaw man, old chibi style.

39:18.349 --> 39:20.889
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be awesome.

39:21.389 --> 39:23.550
[SPEAKER_01]: We need Silent Hill vs. Resident Evil, the fighting game.

39:24.670 --> 39:25.170
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be rad.

39:26.221 --> 39:29.643
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft dares to say that Pac-Man is a survival horror puzzler.

39:30.163 --> 39:34.046
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you do have to solve the puzzle of every maze, and you are running from ghosts, right?

39:37.448 --> 39:37.548
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

39:39.069 --> 39:40.029
[SPEAKER_01]: That reminded me of something.

39:40.169 --> 39:40.510
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

39:40.990 --> 39:47.274
[SPEAKER_01]: I just noticed this while we were watching Tron last week, that you can see Pac-Man in the background of one of the levels of Sark.

39:47.634 --> 39:48.174
[SPEAKER_03]: End of line.

39:48.535 --> 39:49.475
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I had to mention that.

39:49.675 --> 39:50.176
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's fine.

39:50.536 --> 39:52.437
[SPEAKER_03]: I always appreciate the random Tron reference.

39:53.838 --> 39:54.158
[SPEAKER_01]: I just...

39:54.924 --> 39:57.366
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying random video game reference, but still.

39:57.386 --> 39:59.528
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anyone pick up Disks of Tron?

39:59.808 --> 40:00.108
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

40:01.109 --> 40:04.472
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the demo, and I was like, God damn, this game was cool, and I was seven.

40:04.952 --> 40:05.853
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?

40:06.513 --> 40:08.815
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still wasn't as cool as the other one.

40:09.535 --> 40:09.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

40:10.676 --> 40:14.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Disks of Tron was better in the movie, although I am still all for it.

40:14.359 --> 40:15.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that you who said that on the show, or Jamie?

40:15.860 --> 40:16.241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

40:16.461 --> 40:18.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said they should make it a ride at Disneyland.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Disks of Tron should be a ride at Disneyland.

40:20.184 --> 40:20.884
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably Jamie.

40:20.904 --> 40:22.325
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you fall through the floor?

40:22.345 --> 40:23.166
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never say anything like that.

40:24.315 --> 40:26.895
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was talking about the people who were having the Tron part.

40:27.236 --> 40:28.516
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't they do it with the Wii?

40:28.856 --> 40:32.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you could use your Wii remote like throwing a Frisbee or something.

40:33.257 --> 40:34.037
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

40:34.237 --> 40:35.037
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

40:35.697 --> 40:38.298
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome, which is why it will never exist.

40:39.998 --> 40:40.958
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

40:42.538 --> 40:43.539
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tron is coming out.

40:43.579 --> 40:43.979
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

40:45.199 --> 40:46.999
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you suggest a ride for Disneyland?

40:47.119 --> 40:48.660
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Disneyland have a suggestion box?

40:48.920 --> 40:50.300
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you have to be an Imagineer.

40:51.656 --> 40:53.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's an Imagineer at Disneyland?

40:53.377 --> 40:58.141
[SPEAKER_03]: We know people that work for Disney and listen to this program because every time Jamie and I talk about our big Disney whoredom.

40:58.421 --> 41:02.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so like Disney friends of Orange Lounge Radio, you have to make this happen.

41:02.044 --> 41:03.405
[SPEAKER_03]: We want a Tron experience.

41:03.445 --> 41:05.727
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if the movie's like 20 years old.

41:06.108 --> 41:06.888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still all kinds of rad.

41:06.908 --> 41:07.709
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Tron shirt.

41:08.510 --> 41:08.930
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

41:08.970 --> 41:09.570
[SPEAKER_03]: Tron is rad.

41:10.671 --> 41:12.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you have to get it in the vault.

41:12.693 --> 41:19.238
[SPEAKER_02]: All they'll do is they'll just like, what the trend has been lately is updating their rides with different movies tied to them.

41:19.278 --> 41:20.199
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the whole

41:20.819 --> 41:22.980
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

41:52.801 --> 41:58.685
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt in response to How to Make Rides at Disney in chat says, Sky, you need a special degree in fun.

41:59.826 --> 42:01.647
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't offer fun as a major in my college.

42:01.667 --> 42:02.528
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of disappointed.

42:03.689 --> 42:06.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob says, Rob with two B's says, Teacups of Tron.

42:09.252 --> 42:10.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're getting too random.

42:10.453 --> 42:11.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, Jamie, give us a story.

42:12.134 --> 42:12.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Save us.

42:12.555 --> 42:14.496
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, Tron's coming out on the Nintendo.

42:14.556 --> 42:14.916
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

42:14.976 --> 42:15.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

42:16.097 --> 42:20.180
[SPEAKER_01]: Famitsu has said that Tron... I can't do that.

42:20.300 --> 42:20.500
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

42:20.520 --> 42:20.600
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

42:21.670 --> 42:32.656
[SPEAKER_01]: Famitsu reported that Disgaea will be out on the Nintendo DS in Japan, titled Disgaea Prince of the Demon World.

42:32.756 --> 42:43.882
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much really else about it, but it's been rumored that it's actually a port of the original Disgaea Hour of Darkness.

42:45.703 --> 42:49.985
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently unlockable in it is, you know, the teacups of Tron.

42:50.871 --> 42:51.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

42:54.293 --> 42:57.776
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's kind of cool though, Disgaea on the DS, because now you can take it with you everywhere you go.

42:58.236 --> 42:59.117
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can touch them.

42:59.397 --> 43:05.541
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to level up to 9,999 levels, which is an insane amount, you probably would have to take it with you everywhere you go.

43:08.403 --> 43:12.505
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese, what, sorry, Ross Steel UT in chat made it funny.

43:12.846 --> 43:17.769
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, in other news, Disgaea has been announced for cell phones, Xbox 360s, and teacups.

43:19.361 --> 43:46.885
[SPEAKER_02]: The Japanese WiiWare promo page has been launched, and they're showing off, I guess, the 11 launch titles that they're going to have for it, including Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Young King, and The Promised Land, Star Soldier R, a remake of Star Soldier, which looks pretty awesome, World Puzzle Mojipitan, I don't even know how to pronounce that, Mojipitan Wii, Pokemon Ranch,

43:47.679 --> 43:51.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mario's Virus Buster, which looks kind of neat.

43:51.281 --> 43:51.601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

43:51.641 --> 43:54.182
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you shoot blocks or something.

43:54.202 --> 43:54.683
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

43:54.823 --> 43:58.985
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'm thinking it might just be a port of Dr. Mario that might be playable online.

43:59.205 --> 44:01.806
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you're firing something.

44:02.526 --> 44:02.867
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

44:03.847 --> 44:04.387
[SPEAKER_02]: But cool.

44:06.088 --> 44:06.609
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

44:06.829 --> 44:08.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Marubo Shikaku.

44:08.810 --> 44:10.270
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what that is.

44:10.911 --> 44:14.773
[SPEAKER_02]: Magnetica, which was that ripoff of Zuma.

44:16.874 --> 44:17.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomberman.

44:18.943 --> 44:25.865
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Okiraku Ping Pong Wii, and Angel Solitaire.

44:26.005 --> 44:27.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, hooray, ping pong on the Wii.

44:27.766 --> 44:28.506
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited.

44:28.706 --> 44:29.507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never been done.

44:30.087 --> 44:32.508
[SPEAKER_02]: And Joy Sound Wii.

44:33.208 --> 44:34.268
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what that is either.

44:35.028 --> 44:36.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a music-based game for the Wii?

44:37.269 --> 44:37.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

44:38.170 --> 44:38.490
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

44:38.830 --> 44:42.291
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had some screenshots up of some different things.

44:44.052 --> 44:44.532
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like...

44:47.850 --> 44:49.531
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mario game looks pretty cool.

44:50.071 --> 44:51.251
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's Star Soldier.

44:51.291 --> 44:53.732
[SPEAKER_02]: That middle one is Star Soldier.

44:54.132 --> 44:55.812
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the bottom one is Magnetica.

44:57.012 --> 45:00.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the website have any information about where you're going to store all this stuff?

45:02.054 --> 45:02.434
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

45:03.074 --> 45:09.695
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a rumor, though, that Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game was going to take up all your memory.

45:10.316 --> 45:10.636
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

45:10.676 --> 45:11.336
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid, though.

45:11.396 --> 45:11.976
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so crazy.

45:13.432 --> 45:14.532
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that's creepy.

45:14.692 --> 45:15.873
[SPEAKER_02]: That Pokemon game.

45:16.393 --> 45:17.053
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

45:17.633 --> 45:19.174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so creepy looking.

45:20.934 --> 45:23.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other games, I don't know what that puzzle game is.

45:23.595 --> 45:26.075
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one that kind of looks like Sudoku, but it's not.

45:27.215 --> 45:28.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Crystal Chronicles looks good.

45:28.416 --> 45:28.976
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

45:29.076 --> 45:30.596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty impressed so far.

45:31.476 --> 45:37.898
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually sort of looking forward to Star Soldier R, but really there's only one good thing to me that has come out of the Star Soldier franchise.

45:38.138 --> 45:38.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is?

45:38.658 --> 45:39.358
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Parodia.

45:40.959 --> 45:42.059
[SPEAKER_03]: You and your Parodius love.

45:42.398 --> 45:43.038
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac-Man vs. Pac-Man

46:07.499 --> 46:12.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man Versus was a game where you could like its big niche was that you could actually play as the ghost.

46:13.402 --> 46:15.643
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, somebody else is kind of taking an idea like that.

46:15.683 --> 46:17.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a classic arcade game, but like reverse it.

46:18.305 --> 46:20.306
[SPEAKER_03]: And the classic game is Space Invaders.

46:20.966 --> 46:21.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad.

46:21.487 --> 46:22.107
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here's the thing.

46:22.367 --> 46:25.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders Extreme is actually kind of sexy.

46:25.229 --> 46:26.329
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if you've played it.

46:26.449 --> 46:28.110
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I remember Loki brought on the show.

46:28.410 --> 46:31.632
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders Extreme is kind of like Luminous meets Space Invaders, which is

46:31.952 --> 46:33.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders Get Even

46:49.654 --> 46:57.160
[SPEAKER_03]: and in this game you will be in control of up to 300 Space Invaders and you get to do death and destruction on human people.

46:57.260 --> 46:58.961
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Pikmin, sort of.

46:59.201 --> 47:00.062
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, yeah.

47:00.202 --> 47:02.024
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been compared to Pikmin and Rampage.

47:02.124 --> 47:03.325
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow, they're all sprightly.

47:04.165 --> 47:16.315
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea yet if it is an actual game, like disc game, or if it's a WiiWare game, but either way I say yes to more Space Invaders nostalgia, because they really did a good job with Extreme, and this looks kind of fun too.

47:17.636 --> 47:19.237
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm all for a

47:19.741 --> 47:20.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Kirby 64 The Crystal Shards

47:49.651 --> 47:52.793
[SPEAKER_01]: which like the title suggests was a Nintendo 64 game.

47:52.813 --> 47:56.215
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thousand Wii points or seven pounds.

47:57.596 --> 48:03.359
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot of Kirby 3D joy and running around and, you know, sucking, I guess.

48:05.080 --> 48:13.946
[SPEAKER_01]: So also coming out is Psychosis, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, 600 Wii points.

48:14.006 --> 48:14.106
[SPEAKER_01]: And

48:18.277 --> 48:31.289
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, this game had a really cool premise, I thought, that you were entering your own mind as a spaceship to get rid of something that's invaded your mind.

48:31.389 --> 48:32.570
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of like R-Type.

48:34.051 --> 48:41.338
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's got this sort of surrealist pattern to it.

48:42.899 --> 48:43.440
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

48:44.561 --> 48:44.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

48:46.957 --> 48:48.758
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these games that you would pay money to re-download?

48:49.878 --> 48:51.739
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Psychosis, maybe.

48:51.959 --> 48:53.819
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and there's another one that I'd probably get.

48:54.079 --> 48:54.380
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

48:54.580 --> 48:59.061
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Turrigan, which was an SNES game.

48:59.261 --> 49:07.124
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 800 points for a virtual console, and it's basically just run-and-shoot stuff.

49:07.744 --> 49:08.524
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a side-scroller.

49:08.744 --> 49:10.745
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that this week's release here, Loki?

49:11.365 --> 49:11.865
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

49:12.025 --> 49:15.146
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the lists I've got are just ones coming out this month.

49:15.167 --> 49:15.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's all right.

49:17.270 --> 49:20.533
[SPEAKER_02]: This month, at least from Sega, we're going to get two titles from them.

49:21.153 --> 49:25.497
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is Puyo Puyo 2, so that should be pretty cool.

49:25.957 --> 49:33.743
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one is Powerball, which does not have anything to do with the lotto, unfortunately.

49:34.684 --> 49:36.666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a hybrid of rugby and football.

49:39.028 --> 49:39.548
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

49:39.768 --> 49:40.969
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat, I guess.

49:41.189 --> 49:45.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those, I believe, were Genesis titles, so if I remember correctly, I think like 800 Wii points?

49:47.256 --> 49:48.097
[SPEAKER_01]: Puyo Puyo 2

50:17.971 --> 50:18.471
[SPEAKER_01]: Puyo Puyo

50:44.782 --> 50:51.604
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to use strategy to, you know, cripple your opponent, too.

50:51.705 --> 50:56.566
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the same concept that you get in Puzzle Fighter, which is why I also like Puzzle Fighter a whole lot.

50:57.286 --> 51:00.648
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I, my very first P.O.P.O.

51:00.668 --> 51:09.151
[SPEAKER_01]: that I played was Kirby's Avalanche, and it was just... I still have my copy, my original copy, that I bought when it was new.

51:09.331 --> 51:12.892
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I do in my big gaming archive somewhere, so...

51:13.700 --> 51:21.502
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, as far as puzzlers go, I think that was one of the big ones to really, you know, make that competitive fun edge in a puzzle game.

51:22.162 --> 51:25.903
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Dark Knight in chat says, I wish the newer Puyo Puyo for the DS was stateside.

51:25.923 --> 51:27.663
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we did have a DS Puyo Puyo.

51:28.223 --> 51:30.224
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is there like a newer version that came out in Japan?

51:30.444 --> 51:31.024
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there must be.

51:31.884 --> 51:33.964
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got Puyo Pop, I think.

51:34.204 --> 51:36.785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which is okay.

51:36.865 --> 51:41.106
[SPEAKER_01]: I still actually need to go back and get Puyo Puyo Sun on Saturn.

51:41.586 --> 51:41.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

51:43.858 --> 51:47.106
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Dark Knight says the newer one is on Wi-Fi.

51:47.588 --> 51:48.209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty rad.

51:48.831 --> 51:49.472
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.

51:49.653 --> 51:50.255
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very cool.

51:51.196 --> 51:58.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since we talked about virtual console releases, let's talk about some things that are going to be sold in a more traditional format this week and travel around the world and talk about the release dates.

51:59.282 --> 52:00.583
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start off with Japan tonight.

52:00.724 --> 52:05.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360 in Japan is getting Skate on March 13th from Electronic Arts.

52:06.068 --> 52:12.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to other systems in Japan, PlayStation 3 also getting Skate, but they're also getting Winning Post 7 Maximum 2008.

52:12.633 --> 52:15.955
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not actually sure what kind of sport that is.

52:15.975 --> 52:16.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning Post?

52:16.976 --> 52:17.576
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horse racing.

52:17.596 --> 52:18.157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say.

52:19.478 --> 52:19.618
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

52:20.543 --> 52:27.090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still not Derby Owner's Club or Final Furlong, which will always be one of my favorite arcade games.

52:27.110 --> 52:29.132
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Furlong is Hump a Horse.

52:29.152 --> 52:32.415
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they had some horse racing games on the Wii in Japan.

52:32.435 --> 52:34.978
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish those were coming over here.

52:34.998 --> 52:35.418
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be funny.

52:35.538 --> 52:40.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm assuming that there must be six other games in this particular series, seeing as they have a seven in it.

52:43.124 --> 52:49.108
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Nintendo Wii, also winning post-7 maximum 2008, which must be kind of fun on the Wii, I imagine.

52:50.249 --> 52:54.352
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii controls are what I imagine they are, where you actually would get to whip your horse with the remote.

52:54.833 --> 52:55.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Mush!

52:56.054 --> 52:57.555
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when you had Politary.

52:58.215 --> 52:58.616
[SPEAKER_03]: The horse?

52:58.836 --> 52:59.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

52:59.436 --> 53:00.717
[SPEAKER_03]: Derby Owners Club, good times.

53:01.037 --> 53:01.618
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss that game.

53:02.179 --> 53:02.820
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:23.234 --> 53:24.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Transformers The Game Nintendo Wii Japan

53:43.229 --> 53:47.592
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't heard yet, you shouldn't buy this game, because it sucks.

53:47.752 --> 53:51.395
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's something that they're saying does not suck, and it's actually all kinds of cool.

53:51.735 --> 53:58.560
[SPEAKER_03]: Baroque on the Wii makes its way in Japan this week, and that is our role-playing game that's going to be pretty hot.

53:58.700 --> 54:00.061
[SPEAKER_03]: A few more weeks, we're going to get that, too.

54:00.081 --> 54:05.485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is coming out here, but if you want to get an early sneak peek and you can understand Japanese, you might want to import that.

54:05.565 --> 54:06.866
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you live in Japan, check it out.

54:07.486 --> 54:08.907
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2, guess what?

54:08.967 --> 54:10.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning post 7, also on PlayStation 2.

54:11.489 --> 54:12.390
[SPEAKER_03]: Also this week on March 13th.

54:13.556 --> 54:17.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would we be without a Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle Orchestra?

54:18.037 --> 54:19.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

54:19.157 --> 54:20.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's actually just a price reduction.

54:20.558 --> 54:21.338
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a new release.

54:21.518 --> 54:21.858
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

54:21.998 --> 54:26.459
[SPEAKER_02]: They should do like a new Owen Dunn type game with Neon Genesis.

54:26.619 --> 54:26.999
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

54:27.399 --> 54:29.180
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of the Evangelion games.

54:29.540 --> 54:31.320
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm so glad I'm not the only one that does tangents.

54:31.480 --> 54:32.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Jamie, you have one of the games.

54:32.941 --> 54:33.141
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?

54:33.161 --> 54:34.381
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of the ones on Saturn.

54:34.561 --> 54:37.862
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the Steel Girlfriend, but the other one that came out.

54:38.322 --> 54:41.323
[SPEAKER_01]: And all it is is really confusing.

54:41.363 --> 54:42.363
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a dating sim.

54:43.475 --> 54:51.598
[SPEAKER_01]: If this one's like the others, it's like a dating sim where you play as Shinji and then you choose different things in battle.

54:51.758 --> 54:53.659
[SPEAKER_01]: Then really it's just, oh look, it's shooting.

54:53.819 --> 54:54.159
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang.

54:54.479 --> 54:55.640
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh look, the creature falls.

54:55.820 --> 54:56.180
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang.

54:56.980 --> 54:59.822
[SPEAKER_02]: How could you think about dating now when the world is ending?

55:01.362 --> 55:01.842
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

55:02.182 --> 55:03.543
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen End of Evangelion.

55:04.485 --> 55:06.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, if I may move on with the releases.

55:06.608 --> 55:11.013
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a new release on PlayStation 2 and it even comes with a limited edition if you want to get it.

55:11.794 --> 55:13.997
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 Riven, the Psy Criminal of Integral.

55:14.958 --> 55:15.759
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the name of the game.

55:15.779 --> 55:16.640
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out in Japan.

55:17.933 --> 55:20.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS.

55:21.095 --> 55:22.135
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty 4.

55:22.755 --> 55:24.136
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know they had to wait for this game.

55:24.176 --> 55:26.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Contra Dual Spirits finally comes out in Japan this week.

55:28.077 --> 55:28.918
[SPEAKER_03]: Dual Love.

55:28.998 --> 55:34.040
[SPEAKER_03]: Kosuru Otome wa Shiori no Joshin comes out as well.

55:35.480 --> 55:36.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of titles this week.

55:36.621 --> 55:38.241
[SPEAKER_03]: More stuff in the Simple DS series.

55:39.282 --> 55:39.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Yu-Gi-Oh!

55:39.982 --> 55:41.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Spirit Summoner gets a price reduction.

55:42.703 --> 55:43.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Koinu no Heia.

55:45.996 --> 55:50.978
[SPEAKER_03]: and Kantan Tanoshi Okiyashi Navi DS comes out from Koei.

55:51.618 --> 55:54.139
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh, this is kind of rad, The Legend of Kage 2.

55:55.359 --> 55:56.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Kage Densetsu comes out.

55:56.959 --> 56:00.861
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot that they were, I remember now hearing a story about that they were making a sequel to Legend of Kage.

56:01.201 --> 56:01.821
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of rad.

56:03.181 --> 56:05.482
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that will be coming out on the Nintendo DS.

56:05.522 --> 56:08.623
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, let me see if there's anything of note on the PSP.

56:10.284 --> 56:11.324
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Dark Sakura.

56:12.277 --> 56:14.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Parodius Portable gets a price reduction this week.

56:15.500 --> 56:16.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out.

56:16.941 --> 56:19.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with Salamander Portable and Twinbee Portable.

56:20.404 --> 56:22.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you need to go on a shopping spree.

56:22.226 --> 56:23.387
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to go on a shopping spree.

56:23.927 --> 56:28.511
[SPEAKER_01]: No new games, but... I love Twinbee and Parodius and Salamander.

56:29.192 --> 56:34.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Some accessories come out like Easy Pouch Portable and Inner Pouch Portable.

56:34.637 --> 56:37.899
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever wanted to camouflage Inner Pouch, here's your chance.

56:39.461 --> 56:39.541
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

56:41.052 --> 56:41.832
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's move on.

56:42.673 --> 56:43.053
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

56:44.113 --> 56:45.754
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our UK releases.

56:45.894 --> 56:51.656
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 13th is Sam & Max episode 204, Chariots of the Dogs, on PC.

56:52.316 --> 56:56.517
[SPEAKER_01]: And 14th, Rob's favorite, Build-A-Bear Workshop on the DS.

56:56.577 --> 56:57.238
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hooray.

56:58.218 --> 57:00.679
[SPEAKER_02]: That is coming for Wii sometime soon, too.

57:00.719 --> 57:01.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

57:03.598 --> 57:15.151
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI Hard Evidence, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker, Fish Tycoon, FlatOutHeadOn, Jumper on Wii,

57:19.500 --> 57:32.686
[SPEAKER_01]: Master of Illusion on DS, No More Heroes on Wii, Star Trek Conquest which will be PS2 and Wii, The Spiderwick Chronicles on DS and Turning Point Fall of Liberty on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC.

57:33.146 --> 57:34.587
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another Star Trek game coming out?

57:35.287 --> 57:35.787
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

58:02.213 --> 58:05.034
[SPEAKER_02]: In the U.S., we're getting some good stuff this week.

58:05.794 --> 58:14.495
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, today, Smash Bros., if you haven't picked it up yet, or just, I don't know, maybe haven't heard over the last six months, that's coming out today.

58:14.915 --> 58:15.255
[SPEAKER_02]: It has.

58:16.916 --> 58:20.836
[SPEAKER_02]: Later this week, though, we've got some cool stuff, including Condemned 2, Bloodshot.

58:20.876 --> 58:24.777
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

58:25.457 --> 58:30.338
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the mood for a light gun game for the Wii, we've got House of the Dead 2 and 3 Returns.

58:31.269 --> 58:32.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Wappen2999 Insecticide ProEvo2008 BuzzJrRoboJam

58:58.609 --> 59:00.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Nanostray 2 Wild Arms XF Wrestling Games

59:24.708 --> 59:32.552
[SPEAKER_02]: WWE Smackdown vs. Raw Superstar Series Buzz, The Hollywood Quiz, Ratchet & Clank Size Matters, World Championship Cards on PSP

59:52.465 --> 01:00:02.988
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't wait for the wireless Wii nunchuck adapter, they've got the cord-free wireless adapter for your existing nunchucks.

01:00:03.068 --> 01:00:07.909
[SPEAKER_02]: So until the actual wireless nunchuck comes out, that'll, I guess, have to do.

01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:18.412
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, unfortunately, I have to mention this, but I believe... No, actually, that may be Monday.

01:00:18.512 --> 01:00:21.393
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, but coming out next week, or the week after next, I should say,

01:00:22.503 --> 01:00:25.484
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Judgment, Biolith, Rebellion 2, Booster Pack.

01:00:26.024 --> 01:00:27.125
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice cards for that.

01:00:27.525 --> 01:00:29.486
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a million copies to sell, folks.

01:00:33.427 --> 01:00:37.589
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, we will not be including the Booster Packs, I'm afraid.

01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:39.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, jerk.

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:43.531
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind, don't buy it.

01:00:43.551 --> 01:00:45.252
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't we get to include the sales of some other game?

01:00:47.459 --> 01:00:48.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Let's Be Friends Forever?

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.141
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

01:00:49.722 --> 01:00:51.784
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Let's Ride Friends Forever maybe?

01:00:51.824 --> 01:00:52.325
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

01:00:52.405 --> 01:00:54.428
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it may have been Let's Ride Friends Forever.

01:00:54.448 --> 01:00:56.050
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:57.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Just got to keep track of all these games.

01:00:57.792 --> 01:00:58.072
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:00:58.653 --> 01:00:59.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Better part of the bet.

01:01:00.646 --> 01:01:08.013
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one game definitely wasn't a part of the bet because it probably would have sold tons of copies and Loki would be running around in a tingle suit before we know it, is Bully.

01:01:08.413 --> 01:01:14.119
[SPEAKER_03]: But some people who bought the new version of Bully on the 360 this week apparently were left pretty disappointed.

01:01:14.839 --> 01:01:17.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the game came out and it was buggy.

01:01:17.842 --> 01:01:21.686
[SPEAKER_03]: There's audio glitches, frame rate problems, crashes.

01:01:22.447 --> 01:01:25.710
[SPEAKER_03]: This game definitely did not really...

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:29.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Do very well in QA or something, or I don't know if they were asleep or what.

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:32.057
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they just said, release it, we'll fix it in a week.

01:01:32.557 --> 01:01:33.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, who knows?

01:01:33.297 --> 01:01:34.058
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

01:01:34.118 --> 01:01:35.238
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who's to blame for this.

01:01:35.298 --> 01:01:38.179
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they were doing it on dev kits or something and something changed.

01:01:38.299 --> 01:01:38.720
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:43.242
[SPEAKER_03]: But regardless, Rockstar Games has basically come out and made a public apology.

01:01:43.902 --> 01:01:45.343
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically just a giant my bad.

01:01:45.863 --> 01:01:48.644
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are going to be doing a title update via Xbox Live.

01:01:48.664 --> 01:01:51.165
[SPEAKER_03]: They are going to release a patch sometime in the next week.

01:01:52.246 --> 01:01:52.366
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

01:01:53.290 --> 01:02:00.394
[SPEAKER_03]: No word yet if Rockstar is actually going to be offering a complete replacement program kind of like had to happen for Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii.

01:02:00.414 --> 01:02:01.894
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not, because they're fixing it.

01:02:02.115 --> 01:02:03.115
[SPEAKER_02]: They can patch it on 360.

01:02:03.175 --> 01:02:10.679
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii doesn't really have anything built in the place where they can patch that stuff, so that's why they have to do full replacements.

01:02:12.239 --> 01:02:14.501
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you pick up Bully by chance?

01:02:14.521 --> 01:02:15.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you own any version of Bully?

01:02:17.142 --> 01:02:18.082
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't own Bully.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.243
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I may try it on the Wii.

01:02:20.744 --> 01:02:21.104
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:02:21.164 --> 01:02:21.484
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

01:02:22.988 --> 01:02:26.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the Wii have all the waggle controls and all that good stuff?

01:02:26.071 --> 01:02:28.032
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, and I don't know.

01:02:28.212 --> 01:02:30.734
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have time to play it right now.

01:02:30.794 --> 01:02:31.495
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe later I'll pick it up when it drops in price some more.

01:02:34.937 --> 01:02:37.079
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, our chat room's full of comedians tonight.

01:02:37.139 --> 01:02:40.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob with 2B says, Maybe Bully was a typo for Buggy.

01:02:41.202 --> 01:02:45.645
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tigerclaw says, The 360 has been bullied from the sounds of it.

01:02:49.468 --> 01:02:50.769
[SPEAKER_03]: No two-drink minimum here, folks.

01:02:50.989 --> 01:02:51.069
[SPEAKER_01]: Mmm.

01:02:51.678 --> 01:02:52.479
[SPEAKER_03]: All for free in chat.

01:03:17.319 --> 01:03:45.466
[SPEAKER_01]: um there's also the the actual first game is going to be called Touch Fighter which you use um as a uh I guess like a steering wheel the note on here says it took two weeks to develop so it probably isn't going to be all that great um and then um there's also uh um some talk about worms possibly a port of worms and a few other things so and Apple's going to be making 30 percent of uh

01:03:46.181 --> 01:03:49.222
[SPEAKER_01]: Every sale, so that's going to be good news for them.

01:03:50.902 --> 01:03:52.403
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have some monkey ball.

01:03:54.343 --> 01:03:55.283
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds so wrong.

01:03:55.804 --> 01:03:57.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Gold Banjo calls it eyespore.

01:04:00.145 --> 01:04:06.426
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh man, we unleashed a beast because me reading jokes in chat, just now everything's going downhill now.

01:04:07.647 --> 01:04:10.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of Dad says eyespore would be an eyesore.

01:04:11.808 --> 01:04:11.888
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah!

01:04:14.941 --> 01:04:17.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, he did not say that, did he?

01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:18.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:04:18.502 --> 01:04:19.702
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkTetsuya, no.

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:20.643
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:04:20.763 --> 01:04:22.723
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't talk to you, you don't have an iPhone.

01:04:23.343 --> 01:04:25.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, one of Extrofer's quotes?

01:04:25.184 --> 01:04:26.204
[SPEAKER_03]: That was in one of his YouTubes.

01:04:27.105 --> 01:04:28.225
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's funny stuff.

01:04:28.405 --> 01:04:30.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Tangent, hello.

01:04:31.186 --> 01:04:31.686
[SPEAKER_01]: That's us.

01:04:32.686 --> 01:04:33.646
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tangent cast.

01:04:34.327 --> 01:04:42.309
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Bungie, after hearing the story last week about a kid who sent in his Xbox 360 that had been signed by

01:04:43.101 --> 01:04:51.587
[SPEAKER_02]: Various members of the Bungie team and also from Rooster Teeth, the folks who do Red vs. Blue.

01:04:52.868 --> 01:05:02.775
[SPEAKER_02]: Having it come back completely wiped clean, Bungie has actually rallied together to kind of make up for Microsoft's mistake.

01:05:03.515 --> 01:05:05.957
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've, I think, gone a little bit above and beyond.

01:05:06.017 --> 01:05:10.320
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent him a full, I don't know, swag...

01:05:10.902 --> 01:05:32.275
[SPEAKER_02]: Box, basically, with a signed Halo 3 helmet signed by the entire team of Bungie and just a whole bunch of other swag from Halo 3, including the limited edition controllers, the Tom McFarlane figurines, faceplates, wall graphics, just everything.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:34.397
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Bungie.

01:05:35.437 --> 01:05:37.018
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was really cool of them, too.

01:05:37.859 --> 01:05:38.679
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have to.

01:05:38.719 --> 01:05:39.840
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't their fault, but

01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:41.211
[SPEAKER_01]: They made good on it.

01:05:42.392 --> 01:05:43.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Achievement unlocked.

01:05:43.794 --> 01:05:44.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Ass successfully kissed.

01:05:57.762 --> 01:06:06.707
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that is probably inevitable, it's going to happen at some point, is that Microsoft's going to want to upgrade those hard drives that are custom to come with the three.

01:06:06.727 --> 01:06:08.268
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, is the show boring you, DarkSakura?

01:06:08.348 --> 01:06:08.528
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:10.149
[SPEAKER_03]: She just let out a big old yawn.

01:06:10.189 --> 01:06:11.370
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the mic picked that up.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:13.831
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was, I needed oxygen.

01:06:15.352 --> 01:06:15.612
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:16.453
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's all right.

01:06:17.635 --> 01:06:25.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, apparently Microsoft is going to be getting rid of the 20GB hard drive that currently comes with the core system, but no worries, it's actually something better that's going to happen.

01:06:25.358 --> 01:06:27.419
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to get a 60GB system.

01:06:27.739 --> 01:06:31.481
[SPEAKER_03]: So the core system is going away, and instead you're going to get a pro system.

01:06:32.281 --> 01:06:39.564
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's coming from a site named Trusted Reviews, and they seem pretty sure about this new world exclusive they've got.

01:06:40.044 --> 01:06:44.766
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, usually we don't trust no-name sites, but then again, what are we, right?

01:06:45.846 --> 01:06:47.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, here's my thought on it.

01:06:47.788 --> 01:06:48.488
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.

01:06:49.129 --> 01:06:50.090
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it makes sense.

01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:53.873
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think they're gonna, um, get rid of the core system.

01:06:54.033 --> 01:06:56.795
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because they still have the... I'm sorry, I meant premium, not core.

01:06:56.815 --> 01:06:57.615
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell was I thinking?

01:06:57.655 --> 01:06:58.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, chat.

01:06:59.177 --> 01:07:08.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the premium system, what they may do, because, you know, the cost of storage is obviously coming down, is they may just start replacing the, you know, 20s with 60s.

01:07:08.204 --> 01:07:11.887
[SPEAKER_02]: So, eventually, you know, they won't be selling the 20 gig hard drive anymore.

01:07:11.907 --> 01:07:14.849
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just come with a 60 gig hard drive, probably for the same price.

01:07:16.795 --> 01:07:19.456
[SPEAKER_02]: Or hey, maybe they'll include a price drop in that at the same time.

01:07:19.616 --> 01:07:20.456
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

01:07:21.096 --> 01:07:21.596
[SPEAKER_02]: But I doubt it.

01:07:23.657 --> 01:07:30.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this would make a lot of sense, though, that this is just a matter of time before this comes out, so we shall see.

01:07:32.139 --> 01:07:42.501
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as far as other things to see, and this makes me happy, there is going to be, finally, a Doctor Who game coming out for...

01:07:43.607 --> 01:07:46.348
[SPEAKER_01]: The DS, PS2, and PC.

01:07:46.488 --> 01:07:48.289
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes me very, very, very happy.

01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:53.492
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm assuming that you'd probably play as the 10th Doctor.

01:07:53.892 --> 01:07:56.934
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would just assume, although it would be kind of cool if you get your choice, you know.

01:07:57.894 --> 01:08:01.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you, like, play as a Dalek and exterminate everything in your path.

01:08:03.377 --> 01:08:04.537
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that would be awesome.

01:08:04.778 --> 01:08:10.761
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there were Doctor Who games, like, you know, back in, you know, the early 80s, I think.

01:08:11.281 --> 01:08:11.521
[SPEAKER_01]: But

01:08:12.051 --> 01:08:13.371
[SPEAKER_01]: This just makes me happy.

01:08:15.172 --> 01:08:18.333
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be kind of cool, though, if you could play as a Cyberman and upgrade everybody.

01:08:19.073 --> 01:08:21.253
[SPEAKER_03]: Any details about what exactly the game's going to tell?

01:08:21.273 --> 01:08:24.934
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I seem to remember we had this announcement on the show before, but it was like a rumor.

01:08:25.534 --> 01:08:32.116
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just kind of curious, did we get any bonus information, or is this just people wanting us to remember that it is coming soon?

01:08:32.296 --> 01:08:36.937
[SPEAKER_01]: Eidos is bringing it out, and the quote is not too far away as far as a release date.

01:08:37.657 --> 01:08:39.638
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets the soon category.

01:08:41.337 --> 01:08:42.697
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will be coming soon.

01:08:43.017 --> 01:08:44.898
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say probably later than soon.

01:08:45.878 --> 01:08:47.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, congratulations, DarkSakura.

01:08:47.458 --> 01:08:50.459
[SPEAKER_03]: You have successfully worked a Doctor Who reference into our program.

01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:51.259
Woohoo!

01:08:52.039 --> 01:08:52.459
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

01:08:53.639 --> 01:08:55.360
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you I'd find the noise at some point.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:57.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.961
[SPEAKER_01]: He's keeping track of our achievement points, chat room.

01:09:00.901 --> 01:09:06.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Loki, if you can successfully read the next story with no boo-boos, 30 gamerscore.

01:09:10.823 --> 01:09:10.903
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

01:09:12.552 --> 01:09:20.354
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sega made an announcement basically this week saying that they're not interested in a buyout from EA.

01:09:21.655 --> 01:09:31.377
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically they had an interview with Reuters and the Sega Sammy CEO Simon Jeffrey said his company is eager to ride the industry's recent wave of consolidation.

01:09:32.597 --> 01:09:34.578
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not an area we want to play in right now.

01:09:34.618 --> 01:09:36.718
[SPEAKER_02]: He said we have no interest in being acquired.

01:09:36.778 --> 01:09:38.819
[SPEAKER_02]: We are very happy with our position right now.

01:09:41.283 --> 01:09:44.105
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my thought on this is, who asked you?

01:09:44.425 --> 01:09:59.052
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no one's trying to buy Sega right now, so Well, Loki, tell us what you really think Well, we don't want to be bought out right now That's okay, we don't want to buy you right now either, so That's exactly what Ross Steel UT in chat says Who the hell wants to buy Sega, Sammy?

01:10:01.993 --> 01:10:03.034
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of sad

01:10:03.712 --> 01:10:08.176
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, but, you know, it's just kind of like, you know, well, we don't want to be bought out.

01:10:08.296 --> 01:10:12.179
[SPEAKER_02]: See, it's not like, you know, it's not like they're not getting offered to be bought out.

01:10:12.279 --> 01:10:15.281
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, well, even if we were offered, we'd say no, so.

01:10:15.641 --> 01:10:19.144
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ranma in chat says, leave Sega alone!

01:10:22.167 --> 01:10:24.468
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to make games for you!

01:10:24.488 --> 01:10:32.615
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they did buy Sega, you would get the rights to the official...

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:34.950
[SPEAKER_02]: Beijing 2008 Olympics Game

01:10:53.924 --> 01:10:57.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, EA and Sega could team up, you know, possibly on The Sims 3.

01:10:58.428 --> 01:11:02.431
[SPEAKER_03]: Because The Sims 3, you know, has been actually announced that it is coming.

01:11:02.991 --> 01:11:04.733
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the thing about The Sims 3.

01:11:05.073 --> 01:11:05.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the big twist.

01:11:05.874 --> 01:11:08.456
[SPEAKER_03]: In The Sims 3, you will be going outside.

01:11:10.237 --> 01:11:12.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, not in real life, unfortunately.

01:11:13.701 --> 01:11:14.482
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:11:43.461 --> 01:11:45.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Sleep and Poop and all that stuff.

01:11:45.184 --> 01:11:51.557
[SPEAKER_03]: So, speaking of which, there will be no more P-Meter in The Sims.

01:11:51.597 --> 01:11:53.421
[SPEAKER_03]: They are getting rid of that in The Sims 3.

01:11:54.404 --> 01:12:20.514
[SPEAKER_03]: here's a quote from the latest issue of Games for Windows magazine quote the biggest change to The Sims 3 is that it takes place in a wide open constantly changing neighborhood a much bigger sandbox if you will and a much more complex situation the town and park you see on the cover image to the right exists in the same seamless space as your Sims household and what you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within so you can't let yourself in front of people unfortunately no

01:12:21.687 --> 01:12:24.507
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the best thing was to send somebody on a date and ignore their pee meter.

01:12:27.848 --> 01:12:32.589
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the best thing was my old roommate, Billy, did the best house ever.

01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:33.389
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hilarious.

01:12:33.789 --> 01:12:40.370
[SPEAKER_03]: He had seven gay guys all in a house, and he had them all making out with each other or whatever, and then there was one woman that lived there.

01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:50.072
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, somewhere along the line, he forgot to build a bathroom, so the poor woman just had to clean up all the guys' messes, and eventually she died of fatigue.

01:12:50.112 --> 01:12:50.992
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really sad.

01:12:51.949 --> 01:13:05.654
[SPEAKER_01]: but she could never go to bed because she always had to... Julie made the Death House which had like a swimming pool with no ladder and had flammable objects and she wouldn't teach them how to cook but she'd make them cook.

01:13:06.254 --> 01:13:10.255
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is they won't jump into the pool unless you put a ladder in.

01:13:10.295 --> 01:13:11.076
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you take it out.

01:13:11.096 --> 01:13:14.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you take it out once they're in the pool and then they don't know how to get out of the pool without a ladder.

01:13:15.597 --> 01:13:16.137
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:20.759
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, ordinary people can climb out of a pool without a ladder.

01:13:21.488 --> 01:13:23.869
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the Sims can't do it.

01:13:24.369 --> 01:13:30.852
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd make like cells, you know, where you put them in the room and then you lock, and then you remove the door so that they're just trapped in the room.

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:35.074
[SPEAKER_02]: You trap them in the wall and you put a table with a radio on it, full blast.

01:13:35.554 --> 01:13:37.755
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had like a full graveyard in the backyard.

01:13:37.815 --> 01:13:39.736
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm thinking we have issues.

01:13:40.377 --> 01:13:42.057
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, seriously, issues.

01:13:42.838 --> 01:13:49.040
[SPEAKER_02]: I like snatching people off the street in debug mode and throwing them into my house and they're never to be seen ever again.

01:13:49.961 --> 01:13:50.101
[SPEAKER_02]: Shh.

01:13:52.483 --> 01:13:53.884
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week

01:14:16.298 --> 01:14:17.059
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a game.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:20.481
[SPEAKER_03]: Please say you've picked something relatively sane for the listeners tonight.

01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:21.441
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no!

01:14:22.262 --> 01:14:24.303
[SPEAKER_01]: I've picked something intensely insane.

01:14:25.904 --> 01:14:30.227
[SPEAKER_01]: I have VidRibbon as our game of the week, which is quite insane.

01:14:30.527 --> 01:14:36.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this would have nothing to do with the fact that you have kind of like brought up this game and referenced it on previous shows.

01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:38.552
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to pick it.

01:14:39.472 --> 01:14:39.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

01:14:39.733 --> 01:14:40.533
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can do whatever you want.

01:14:40.553 --> 01:14:43.375
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to play the intro for everybody so they know how to play it.

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:58.943
[SPEAKER_01]: The game sings to you to tell you how to play it.

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:05.986
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole tutorial is sung to you by the stupid little rabbit, and the game's all vector, which I think is pretty freaking fantastic.

01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:12.709
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not like true vector, but it's like a simple line, and a line-drawing bunny that you play as.

01:15:13.545 --> 01:15:22.749
[SPEAKER_01]: And the game was developed by Matsura Masaya, who was the guy who brought us Parappa and Jermalani.

01:15:24.450 --> 01:15:31.794
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, Vibri, who is the main character, if you do badly, well, let me start off how to play it.

01:15:32.034 --> 01:15:33.634
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, you've got obstacles that are in the way.

01:15:33.674 --> 01:15:36.976
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a block or a loop.

01:15:37.631 --> 01:15:39.272
[SPEAKER_01]: or a wave or a pit.

01:15:40.192 --> 01:15:46.474
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to press a different button to bypass this as you're going along on basically this continuous line.

01:15:49.055 --> 01:15:59.739
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that it goes is, you know, if you don't go over the obstacles by pressing the right button, you will get hurt.

01:15:59.859 --> 01:16:06.182
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more you get hurt, you change forms and you can turn from a rabbit into a frog and then a worm and then you just die.

01:16:06.733 --> 01:16:10.096
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you do really well, you eventually turn into a fairy princess.

01:16:13.798 --> 01:16:15.299
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, this sounds like your kind of game.

01:16:15.319 --> 01:16:16.600
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be a fairy princess.

01:16:17.021 --> 01:16:17.981
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, totally.

01:16:18.682 --> 01:16:19.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now.

01:16:20.003 --> 01:16:31.111
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other things about this is that there are six, I believe, no, there's a few songs that are, yeah, six songs that are included.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.127
[SPEAKER_01]: in the game itself.

01:16:35.167 --> 01:16:40.959
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you can put in your own CDs and play whatever you want to, which we tried to do to like a whole bunch of old...

01:16:41.832 --> 01:16:44.193
[SPEAKER_01]: Beatmania stuff, but I found the best thing ever.

01:17:16.363 --> 01:17:18.164
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's Bib Ribbon's Dragon Force.

01:17:20.326 --> 01:17:22.447
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dragon Force, of course, makes any game epic.

01:17:22.808 --> 01:17:32.415
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a little bit more as you go into this game, just a few more details, is that some of your other obstacles are combinations of your basic core obstacles.

01:17:32.935 --> 01:17:37.879
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to press the combination of the two buttons that would have been for the individual obstacle, which is where I was getting hung up.

01:17:38.419 --> 01:17:42.302
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have different levels of gameplay where you'll have your...

01:17:43.547 --> 01:17:53.415
[SPEAKER_01]: Obstacles coming at you, but then as you go through harder levels, they'll cross over each other, so you really don't know.

01:17:53.756 --> 01:17:55.997
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's coming up, but you don't know that that's the next one.

01:17:56.017 --> 01:17:58.840
[SPEAKER_01]: So the obstacles are coming towards you at different speeds.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:08.187
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also play it straightforward, as in you're just staring at it across the screen, but as you play harder levels, you're playing at it from different angles.

01:18:08.888 --> 01:18:11.390
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite a bit harder.

01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:11.450
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

01:18:13.263 --> 01:18:17.164
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, the guy that brought this out, Gaze, that's Krapa and M. General Lamy.

01:18:17.744 --> 01:18:19.284
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also sequels.

01:18:19.304 --> 01:18:24.065
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Mojibribin, which I think I'm actually still going to pick up.

01:18:24.265 --> 01:18:31.267
[SPEAKER_01]: But Mojibribin, you basically are... It's almost like you're rapping, but you're playing kanji.

01:18:31.587 --> 01:18:32.567
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it once.

01:18:32.767 --> 01:18:33.987
[SPEAKER_03]: It is fascinating.

01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:35.588
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so different than Vibribin.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:36.788
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a third Vibribin, too.

01:18:36.848 --> 01:18:37.888
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Vibripple.

01:18:38.188 --> 01:18:39.088
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:18:39.168 --> 01:18:40.669
[SPEAKER_01]: That came out as well.

01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:42.229
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibripple is...

01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:49.211
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be done with different images that are loaded into the game that you play with.

01:18:49.871 --> 01:19:00.134
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there is talk of making a remake of the ribbon for PS3 that will be out via the PlayStation Network.

01:19:00.414 --> 01:19:00.914
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

01:19:02.615 --> 01:19:09.136
[SPEAKER_01]: And the closest thing we're discussing the possibility of making a downloadable version of the ribbon for Sony, but I don't know yet.

01:19:10.077 --> 01:19:11.017
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be really cool.

01:19:11.829 --> 01:19:17.651
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, this game came out in Japan and came out in Europe, but we never got it in America.

01:19:19.092 --> 01:19:22.433
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so weird to see the intro in English when I looked at this YouTube.

01:19:22.533 --> 01:19:26.015
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh yeah, that's right, they got this game in Europe, because I've only ever played the Japanese one that you had.

01:19:26.055 --> 01:19:31.797
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I linked it to you so that you could see, because it has this, and it's not an exact translation, but I love the little, I love Vibri.

01:19:31.817 --> 01:19:32.757
[SPEAKER_03]: Close enough, close enough.

01:19:32.837 --> 01:19:34.018
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Vibri, okay?

01:19:34.038 --> 01:19:34.898
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibri is great.

01:19:36.499 --> 01:19:37.059
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent stuff.

01:19:38.483 --> 01:19:41.706
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and also when you get the high score in this game, he sings a little song to you.

01:19:43.348 --> 01:19:45.970
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be a link up there of the song he sings when you get a high score.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:50.675
[SPEAKER_01]: He does this little dance and says, Yay, you got a high score, let me serenade you.

01:19:52.837 --> 01:19:53.738
[SPEAKER_01]: This game is great.

01:19:53.758 --> 01:19:55.420
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, he's a fairy princess now.

01:19:55.897 --> 01:20:00.221
[SPEAKER_03]: A lovely dose of insanity courtesy of DarkSakura from the ever so cracked out.

01:20:00.261 --> 01:20:00.982
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to check it.

01:20:01.042 --> 01:20:01.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Search this on YouTube.

01:20:01.983 --> 01:20:02.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the videos.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:03.004
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:04.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Vib Ribbon.

01:20:04.305 --> 01:20:07.268
[SPEAKER_03]: That's V-I-B Ribbon is the name of the game.

01:20:07.708 --> 01:20:08.309
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out.

01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:11.892
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this week's classic game of the week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:12.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Good pick, DarkSakura.

01:20:13.914 --> 01:20:15.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Predictable, but good.

01:20:15.055 --> 01:20:16.497
[SPEAKER_03]: I approve.

01:20:16.537 --> 01:20:17.538
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a matter of time.

01:20:18.198 --> 01:20:19.420
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was just a matter of time.

01:20:20.222 --> 01:20:27.306
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, that's going to do it here for Orange Lounge Radio Part A, but we will be back in a little while with more of Orange Lounge Radio on Part B of our podcast.

01:20:27.326 --> 01:20:30.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we are hoping we will have a Part B this week.

01:20:30.167 --> 01:20:31.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is arranged so that should happen.

01:20:31.968 --> 01:20:33.469
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned.

01:20:33.509 --> 01:20:35.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Part B will be coming at you in just a few days.

01:20:36.691 --> 01:20:37.571
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see you then.

01:20:38.112 --> 01:20:43.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

01:20:43.535 --> 01:20:47.857
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
