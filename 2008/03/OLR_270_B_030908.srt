1
00:00:00,885 --> 00:00:01,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:29,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than Steam, you can now buy the, or soon, you will be able to buy the components of the Orange Box separately.

3
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:33,193
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be hitting retail stores on April 9th.

4
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:38,437
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to buy Portal for $19.99 and then, of course, Half-Life 2 Episode 1 and 2 for $29.99 and Team Fortress 2 for $29.99.

5
00:00:38,477 --> 00:00:40,538
[SPEAKER_03]: All sold separately now.

6
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:41,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So, awesome.

7
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:42,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

8
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Half-Life 2, I don't think, was that expensive to begin with.

9
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:56,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you might as well just buy them all.

10
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:07,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a really good way for people who haven't seen Portal yet to get it, because I know people that would consider that $60 for Portal was a decent buy, and you got all these other cool games free.

11
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:15,423
[SPEAKER_06]: So, honestly, this is an excellent... I mean, not to knock the other games, because the Orange Box is a great combo package, but certainly there's a lot of people that want to see Portal by itself.

12
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:21,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you've owned... if you already owned, like, Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, although if you buy the Episode Pack, you're getting one all over again, so...

13
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:23,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

14
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:25,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, go ahead.

15
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:28,018
[SPEAKER_10]: That whole bunch of Half-Life is just epic.

16
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:29,819
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very epic.

17
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I never realized you were quite the Half-Life fan, DarkSakura, but during our bonus segment tonight, which only the live listeners heard, you're quite a Half-Life fan.

18
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:38,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize.

19
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:43,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, keep in mind, I can't really play them because I get bad motion sickness when I play them.

20
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:45,389
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean you don't recognize a good game when you see one.

21
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, right.

22
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,591
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love the story for Half-Life, too.

23
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Half-Life was sort of like...

24
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:53,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you crawl through some pipes and you kill some aliens.

25
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:59,436
[SPEAKER_10]: But I thought that Half-Life 2 had a very, actually a really involved story.

26
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:00,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was very good.

27
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:02,218
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very rad.

28
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:08,361
[SPEAKER_10]: I was basically loading up everything on my iPhone and listening to it on YouTube at my desk at work.

29
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:12,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Steel UT has some advice, and I'm kind of curious if it actually would work or not.

30
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:13,764
[SPEAKER_06]: He says play on a smaller screen.

31
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:14,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that help?

32
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:14,524
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

33
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:15,308
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

34
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:15,948
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

35
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:19,529
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually has gotten a little bit better since we started playing on the widescreen.

36
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

37
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:26,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I have a 50-inch widescreen TV, and it was a lot worse on our old CRT, which was smaller.

38
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:27,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

39
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of get the logic behind what he's suggesting, though.

40
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,352
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of weird that it's the reverse.

41
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:33,132
[SPEAKER_10]: The flatter the screen, the less sick I get.

42
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:34,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

43
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:40,354
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also get less eye strain on my old Trinitron versus my old CRT screen.

44
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the eye strain might be...

45
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:44,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

46
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,764
[SPEAKER_10]: But it still is bad, no matter what, it still is bad.

47
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:50,809
[SPEAKER_10]: However, nothing makes me as freaking motion sick as GoldenEye64 did.

48
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:52,212
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

49
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyhow, moving on.

50
00:02:54,424 --> 00:03:00,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of splitting up, Ziff Davis Media owns a lot of stuff, and after this, they might have to split some of it off.

51
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,090
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

52
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:10,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not here yelling doom and gloom, but certainly that's what a lot of people are speculating after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week.

53
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:11,017
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

54
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:13,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Ziff Davis filed for bankruptcy earlier this week.

55
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:17,822
[SPEAKER_06]: They had $390 million in debt since last August.

56
00:03:18,963 --> 00:03:21,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if this bankruptcy is actually approved by the bankruptcy courts...

57
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:22,585
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

58
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,711
[SPEAKER_06]: They are saying that all the video game stuff, it should be business as usual.

59
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:59,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason Young, who is the CEO of Ziff Davis, has this quote, quote, Today's restructuring agreement goes a long way towards resolving the burdens of a debt load and capital structure established seven years ago during a leveraged buyout of the company.

60
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's Chapter 11, right?

61
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:01,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

62
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

63
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:12,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, Chapter 11 is just strictly for businesses only, because we actually, at my work, we occasionally get a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in for...

64
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:15,830
[SPEAKER_10]: for multifamily homes, basically apartments, condos, that type of thing.

65
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:22,596
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is basically done for the purpose of paying back and restructuring their debt.

66
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:25,558
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to give the company a chance to make a fresh start.

67
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:27,160
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

68
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see what happens.

69
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:33,765
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, people are screaming doom and gloom, and our chat room is no different.

70
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:36,247
[SPEAKER_06]: PKJr92 says, does this mean 1UP will die?

71
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:37,568
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

72
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:38,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Doubt it.

73
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's one of their more successful properties, right?

74
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill something.

75
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:47,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the bad thing about Chapter 11 is that it's actually really bad for their stockholders.

76
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:48,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

77
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:55,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if their debts exceed their assets, then when the bankruptcy is done, all of their rights and interests are terminated.

78
00:04:57,028 --> 00:05:02,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, all the creditors have a new business to start with, nothing on the books.

79
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,092
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says, if Davis going bankrupt could mean the end of digital life.

80
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:11,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that because they were a major sponsor, but I don't know.

81
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:13,907
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

82
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's too bad, though, for them, I guess.

83
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

84
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Sucks to be stockholders first.

85
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:25,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Business sucks sometimes, so hopefully this will be a nice fresh start for them.

86
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:30,975
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you can usually tell if there's rumors going out about a company going under when people start selling off their stock.

87
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:31,796
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

88
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:34,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

89
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:34,917
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I got.

90
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how about something that's just a little bit happier, huh?

91
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:39,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

92
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:40,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Midway!

93
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:42,533
[SPEAKER_10]: We like Midway.

94
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:45,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Except Midway's been losing some money, too.

95
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:53,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, more around the amount of $97.4 million last financial year.

96
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:02,323
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're trying to cater more towards the casual gamer by having an online portal for

97
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,040
[SPEAKER_10]: and a lot of those games that are out.

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, basically, it's just... Well, I just completely lost my train of thought.

99
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:10,965
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

100
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Midway owns the rights to a lot of classic franchises though, right?

101
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:15,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

102
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:20,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Midway... It was... Wasn't it Midway that brought us out like Mortal Kombat?

103
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

104
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:28,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I'm going even further back than that because I'm thinking about those like classic packs with like Robotron and Joust and you know, all that.

105
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,021
[SPEAKER_06]: They've rehashed that stuff a thousand times.

106
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:32,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if this is kind of a part of

107
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,463
[SPEAKER_06]: How they're going to launch a more casual games portal.

108
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:44,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, because, you know, I can think of casual games as old school games that were very simple, or I can think of them as, you know, pop cap type casual games, like Bejeweled and stuff.

109
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,911
[SPEAKER_06]: That, again, you know, very easy to pick up and play type games.

110
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:53,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go in probably with the older games, and say like the re-release that shit over and over and over and over and over again.

111
00:06:54,156 --> 00:07:00,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, basically, they're only saying that two titles have been out that's used any of the different type of...

112
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:01,708
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com.

113
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:26,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

114
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:44,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I heart classic games though and if the portal is built good where it does online high score boards and maybe some achievement point type thing and some clever new little innovative things that make it stand out, I would probably check it out.

115
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:51,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we're coming up on the 10th anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast and

116
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:59,198
[SPEAKER_03]: To commemorate that, Sega of Japan has updated their Dreamcast.com website with a question.

117
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still own a Dreamcast?

118
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

119
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:16,527
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do, what you can do is submit your serial number, and they will basically register an account with you with user.dreamcast.com, and you'll get an email, which is your serial number at dreamcast.com.

120
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,962
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is that going to do for me?

121
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:28,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I could register both of mine.

122
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,458
[SPEAKER_06]: There's hardcore Sega people out there.

123
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:32,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Hard fucking core Sega people out there.

124
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie's kind of borderline one of them, I think.

125
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I have two Dreamcasts.

126
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I should register mine so I can have another spam email address.

127
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:40,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

128
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:41,265
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be fun.

129
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:42,105
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird, though.

130
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,346
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have your serial number.

131
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:49,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it almost makes me wonder, like, wow, could they release an email program for the Dreamcast or something really weird all these years later?

132
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,031
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the Dreamcast came out, what, 9-9-99?

133
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:53,592
[SPEAKER_06]: But I imagine it was a little bit before that in Japan.

134
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:54,393
[SPEAKER_06]: We're bringing it back.

135
00:08:54,853 --> 00:08:59,177
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that I got my other one in, I want to say April?

136
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:01,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was probably a few months earlier in Japan.

137
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because I had my Dreamcast way early.

138
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:05,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Why couldn't they?

139
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:06,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that would be kind of cool to bring it back.

140
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:11,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, you know, make it all open source type stuff.

141
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:12,489
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

142
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:17,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they already have a pretty big open source community for homebrew stuff, but...

143
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:22,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, a lot of these portable game systems, even like the DS and stuff, aren't that powerful.

144
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:28,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could probably do a lot on the Dreamcast that you could do on those systems, so... Why not?

145
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:32,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see what happens, see what this develops into.

146
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:35,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we haven't heard the last of the Dreamcast.

147
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:41,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's something, I mean, obviously we don't expect a lot, but even something little, I think them putting out some type of, like...

148
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:42,648
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

149
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:09,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, technology has come a long way since the days of the Dreamcast.

150
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:12,730
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, now we have the Xbox 360, which are on live and all that stuff.

151
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:19,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you know it, it didn't take too long before we have yet another story coming from a CBS news station.

152
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:27,996
[SPEAKER_06]: WCBS-TV in New York is reporting, and this is the headline, alarming trend, online video game predators.

153
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,201
[SPEAKER_06]: The Predator's Story

154
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:51,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

155
00:10:51,262 --> 00:11:03,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's what happened is that, according to the story, apparently things were going fine, and then this guy crashed into somebody, and the webcam picture came back, and it was a butt.

156
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:07,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody put their butt on the webcam.

157
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:16,039
[SPEAKER_06]: But it actually, I don't know, it gets a little sick, because Najee's father, whose name is Charles Johnson, said that the image showed a lot more than just a butt.

158
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:20,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a picture of the guy mooning the camera, and you could actually see his genitals.

159
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:21,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Gross!

160
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:23,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you send that picture over?

161
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:31,513
[SPEAKER_03]: That takes talent, too, because the camera takes the picture pretty quick, so you'd have to crash your car in, like, I don't know.

162
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:34,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you'd have to have your friend standing there, waiting to go.

163
00:11:35,677 --> 00:11:36,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go, yeah.

164
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:38,215
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

165
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:56,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And as sensationalist as the story is, it does make some decent points.

166
00:11:57,837 --> 00:12:04,981
[SPEAKER_06]: The father said that he thought it would be fine to play because the game is rated E for everyone, or E10+, or whatever.

167
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:07,423
[SPEAKER_06]: However, of course, the ESRB does have that warning.

168
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,944
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the beginning of the fucking game.

169
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:13,106
[SPEAKER_03]: For a second there, and you have to hit a button to go past it.

170
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:13,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

171
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,868
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, I understand that, but at the same time,

172
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:19,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, what fucking moron did this?

173
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:29,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to show your butt to your friends is one thing, but to show it to complete strangers when it might be 12-year-old kids playing the game, it's kind of messed up.

174
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,811
[SPEAKER_06]: and causes things like this to happen where now the media runs with it and talks about sexual predators.

175
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,052
[SPEAKER_06]: They were probably high.

176
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're sexual predators.

177
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:41,153
[SPEAKER_06]: They're probably drug users.

178
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:42,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that that makes it right.

179
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:44,374
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because media has nothing to talk about.

180
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:45,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a perfect example.

181
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:52,916
[SPEAKER_03]: We were watching the local news yesterday and they were talking about a fire that happened in North Carolina.

182
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:54,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We live in California.

183
00:12:55,357 --> 00:13:00,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how fucking slow is the news if you're talking about a building fire in another state?

184
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then they proceed to show a, what was it, a chicken sledding.

185
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:09,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how slow the news was.

186
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:13,063
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they run with this crap, because they can spin it, and it's an interesting story.

187
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:18,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll put some, not really put asses in seats, but you know what I mean, tunes people in.

188
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:23,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob with two Bs pours a little salt in the wound, says California has enough of its own fires.

189
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:24,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

190
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:26,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Not right now, they don't.

191
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:27,985
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in between Fire Seas.

192
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:33,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Pendro in chat says this, you should be able to rate people as you play them, like feedback on eBay or something.

193
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the 360 has a system kind of like that.

194
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:37,029
[SPEAKER_06]: But what about PS3?

195
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

196
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe.

197
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:47,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there needs to be a way where something can be done a little more immediately.

198
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:51,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know on Xbox 360, they swear up and down, they do review that stuff.

199
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:52,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

200
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you have to pay people.

201
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:03,210
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, dude, it's a person's ass.

202
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like you're scarred for fucking life.

203
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but I kind of see it.

204
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,254
[SPEAKER_06]: That is kind of nasty.

205
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:15,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you're a 12-year-old kid, because they're saying it's not just his butt, but I guess the whole naughty bits were dangling there, too.

206
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know.

207
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

208
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm so sorry.

209
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:23,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, tomorrow they're going to go out and murder people because they've been severely scarred.

210
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:23,805
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

211
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:28,969
[SPEAKER_03]: You better watch your kids now because now they're going to go on a murderous rage and go and rape and pillage and fucking...

212
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,911
[SPEAKER_03]: The world is over for you and your family.

213
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well, you know, leave the country.

214
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:39,655
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

215
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:42,997
[SPEAKER_06]: He also says you're overreacting.

216
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:46,439
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you're awfully quiet.

217
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,319
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on this?

218
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,702
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a butt, and it's, you know, dingley bits, I guess.

219
00:14:53,590 --> 00:15:00,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're saying, you know what, maybe we should just stop being so freaking sensitive to... I really think that's it.

220
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:04,238
[SPEAKER_10]: If people didn't make a big deal out of this crap, then it wouldn't, you know, be such an issue.

221
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:05,579
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

222
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you have some feedback, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.

223
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:18,669
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, you know what, thinking about that this guy was so stupid to do this to strangers kind of pisses me off and makes me a little bit angsty that this guy was such a moron.

224
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,231
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's time to have the FUs of the week.

225
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I have a few FUs to compile.

226
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, my first one goes, of course, to Daylight Savings Time, because I went to bed at 4.30am, and of course woke up at 1.30am.

227
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:48,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

228
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:59,319
[SPEAKER_10]: My next one goes towards the guy who was driving the red pickup truck, which, by the way, was a Ford, and Ford stands for Fix Off and Repair Daily.

229
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:10,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I was in the left lane, and he was in the right lane, and then he just cut out in front of me, like, literally, with inches to spare, to get into the turning lane on the left side of me.

230
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:13,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, dude, where'd you learn how to drive?

231
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:16,763
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, oh, I'm sorry, you did learn how to drive, if you're driving like that.

232
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate stupid people who drive.

233
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:19,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

234
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:30,081
[SPEAKER_10]: and also another F you goes to my cat for throwing up in an inappropriate place.

235
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:31,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

236
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:34,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Although she's a cute baby and I forgive her.

237
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:35,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

238
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:48,407
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to this guy named Michael T something or I don't remember his last name but apparently I knew enough because we sat there at dinner on Saturday no, Friday, I'm sorry

239
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:54,557
[SPEAKER_03]: and this guy went on and on and on and on about his fucking life next to us.

240
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:57,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently this couple was on their first date or whatever.

241
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel sorry for the woman because this guy just went on and on.

242
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one time I had a felony, but they cleared it, so it's all good now.

243
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:11,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I took in my truck because I'm a... What was it?

244
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:12,855
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a plumbing inspector.

245
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:42,815
[SPEAKER_03]: and I took in my truck one time and they gave me a loaner car and it was an undercover cop car and so I drove through the ghetto and everyone was like oh my god it's the cops went on and on for two hours and he was still talking the entire time I don't think the woman got a word in so sucks for don't meet people on MySpace this is what happens alright my FUs of the week go to also Daylight Savings Time I think it's horrible and you know losing sleep sucks I hate that

246
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,820
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, gosh, I can't really think of a lot else.

247
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:49,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I think just Daylight Saving Time makes up the bulk of my FUs this week.

248
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's unnecessary.

249
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:52,723
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a necessary FU.

250
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when you lose sleep, there's never a good thing to come out of that.

251
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:58,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you have it.

252
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:00,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Our FUs of the week.

253
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:03,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to point this out real quick.

254
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:08,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin is in our JustinTV chat and says that the whole Dreamcast thing

255
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,162
[SPEAKER_06]: It says this is a scam, and gives me a link to the NeoGAF forums that isn't loading for me right now.

256
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:21,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm timing out, so I can't read you the full text of what it says, but apparently that Dreamcast thing may not be legitimate.

257
00:18:21,744 --> 00:18:22,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, who cares?

258
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:22,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care.

259
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:24,804
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking Dreamcast.

260
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:26,285
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they going to do with my serial number?

261
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:27,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

262
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:29,046
[SPEAKER_06]: What can they do with the serial number?

263
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides maybe send spam.

264
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:31,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to give me your email address?

265
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:33,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

266
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:37,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't signed up the site's down, so... Oh, maybe it got taken down for being a big scam!

267
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,279
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's an error thing.

268
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just too many people trying to access it at one time.

269
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:45,464
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

270
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:51,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go ahead and get back into some gaming news.

271
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, no, we're going to go and actually check out the mailbag.

272
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,043
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

273
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,942
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, we are going to open up the mailbag because we did get at least a couple emails, right?

274
00:19:30,523 --> 00:19:30,943
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple.

275
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's enough for us to open up the mailbag and jump on in.

276
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:35,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So fill up the mailbag.

277
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:37,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Give Jamie a lot of work to do next week.

278
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:38,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLingerie.com.

279
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:39,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

280
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:53,620
[SPEAKER_10]: The first email of the week is actually from Cheeseburger asking us to play the intro to Castlevania 64.

281
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:53,740
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

282
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Make me play the intro from a good game and we'll do it.

283
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:00,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha.

284
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:03,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he actually emailed us.

285
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, no, I take that back.

286
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:06,925
[SPEAKER_10]: That wasn't from Cheeseburger.

287
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:10,946
[SPEAKER_10]: It was from... God, now I have to go in that folder to find out who it was.

288
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:14,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he emailed something else, but I can't read half of it on the air.

289
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:16,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

290
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:20,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it involves finding a broken DS and using their serial number to replace it.

291
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:22,529
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're not going to do that.

292
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, snap.

293
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:25,710
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to do that.

294
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

295
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:29,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Not after the debates we've been in the past couple weeks.

296
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe that email's best unread.

297
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:36,953
[SPEAKER_10]: But also he's saying something about, do Koopa and Purin exist in Super Smash Bros.

298
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:37,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Melee?

299
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:38,174
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he means Brawl.

300
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:50,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, he was saying that if you change the language, Bowser becomes Koopa and Jigglypuff becomes Purin, which was their original names, and then you can save them that way?

301
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,463
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you mean, so sorry.

302
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:57,896
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only other email.

303
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:04,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, that one that I lost was from somebody named Jake.

304
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:06,862
[SPEAKER_06]: You lost an email?

305
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:10,344
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's, he didn't put a signature on there.

306
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:14,507
[SPEAKER_10]: The one that I mistakenly gave to Cheeseburger.

307
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:15,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

308
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:17,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

309
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,350
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

310
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,831
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get any like real email.

311
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:21,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Weak.

312
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:25,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for some spam that I'm deleting right now that's titled LOL.

313
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:29,022
[SPEAKER_10]: And Rob did it.

314
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:31,344
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

315
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:33,646
[SPEAKER_10]: It's titled LOL and you laughed.

316
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:34,167
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

317
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:34,687
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

318
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:35,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

319
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:36,288
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

320
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:36,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Lost.

321
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Weak mailbag.

322
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:40,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm disappointed in all of you.

323
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:45,376
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I blame not having a part B last week where we actually had a mailbag to remind you that you can send us emails.

324
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So send us emails.

325
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:47,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at originalsradio.com.

326
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:50,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a hardcore gamer?

327
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:50,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

328
00:21:51,152 --> 00:21:53,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you downloaded the hardcore gamer pack yet?

329
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:53,654
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

330
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:55,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Well then you're not really a hardcore gamer.

331
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, how dare you!

332
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:58,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

333
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:12,105
[SPEAKER_03]: On Xbox Live Marketplace, there is a brand new hardcore gamer picture pack featuring such wonderful pictures as Proud to be a Noob, Camper, Respawn, a little target symbol, and Teabag.

334
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:13,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Teabagged.

335
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:15,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

336
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:15,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

337
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,190
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to buy this, it's only $1.25.

338
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:25,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, all people know that you're truly hardcore if you buy this and display them proudly.

339
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:31,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I would like to point out that for free, you can download community gamer picks.

340
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:34,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're in pack number two of the community gamer picks.

341
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:36,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a little pick that says OLR.

342
00:22:37,178 --> 00:22:41,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you put that on your gamer tag, at least we'll know you're hardcore, as will all the rest of the OLR army.

343
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't download this crap.

344
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:45,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't pay for this.

345
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:47,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, these look really stupid.

346
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:50,490
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt sums up my thoughts exactly.

347
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do they need to endorse stupidity that is teabagging?

348
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:53,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

349
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should ask disruptive media publishers.

350
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:57,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should.

351
00:22:58,174 --> 00:22:59,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a telephone number?

352
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:00,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's call them right now.

353
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:00,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they're there.

354
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:01,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

355
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:02,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get on that.

356
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:05,577
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll send them an email maybe this week.

357
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:06,498
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

358
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:11,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to download the hardcore gamer picks, Loki?

359
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:14,147
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm doing it right now.

360
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:14,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

361
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:15,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

362
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:23,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's pretty hardcore as well is proposing to your significant other over a video game.

363
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:24,914
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you know what's really hardcore?

364
00:23:24,954 --> 00:23:26,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember last year we had this story.

365
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:27,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we had a Viva Pinata story.

366
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:29,997
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an Animal Crossing story, I want to say.

367
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:32,699
[SPEAKER_06]: And this time, this is kind of interesting.

368
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,462
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually made a homebrew version of...

369
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,628
[SPEAKER_06]: of his significant other's favorite game, which was Bejeweled.

370
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,476
[SPEAKER_06]: He made a homebrew version of this on the DS.

371
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:47,378
[SPEAKER_06]: And this guy, Bernie, he's actually a user on Zanga.

372
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,203
[SPEAKER_06]: What he did, he spent a few weeks actually making this Nintendo DS version of Bejeweled completely from the ground up.

373
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:59,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happens is that once the game gets to a certain score, the screen clears.

374
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:03,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what would happen is that a ring of the jewels comes up on the screen.

375
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:12,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And what he did is that when his girlfriend was playing the game and then got on the special screen, Bernie actually had a real ring there and proposed.

376
00:24:13,356 --> 00:24:31,467
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody aww sorry hairball but no that's definitely dedication to build a game to propose to your significant other with that's pretty hardcore so

377
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:33,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

378
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:54,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, if you would like to email Disruptive Media Publishers and tell them how crappy those hardcore gamer pics are, you can email them at info at DisruptivePublishers.com I also have a mailing address on DisruptivePublishers.com Check it out.

379
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:54,943
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in Washington.

380
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:56,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Bellingham, Washington.

381
00:24:56,643 --> 00:25:00,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Ossifer in chat suggests teabag your girlfriend for instant marriage.

382
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,701
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have a Facebook community, too.

383
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:04,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Let her know you're hardcore.

384
00:25:04,782 --> 00:25:06,243
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the cool kids are on Facebook now.

385
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:06,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Teabagger.

386
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:10,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, DarkSakura?

387
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,567
[SPEAKER_06]: If Dan teabagged you in Halo, that's love, right?

388
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:17,630
[SPEAKER_10]: My silence is my answer.

389
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting blinked at.

390
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:20,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps we should move on, then.

391
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:28,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for anyone who's a fan of Undertow, there is an expansion out that it costs...

392
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:30,324
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

393
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:59,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's five levels, you have a new alien race called The Elect, wow, and four multiplayer maps, so there's no other details than that.

394
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,541
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it's been fixed.

395
00:26:04,122 --> 00:26:04,322
Huh.

396
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:14,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was free for, I mean, the game was free for a while, you know, to make up for Xbox Live outages, although I'm not sure if that's really more of a punishment for us or for, you know,

397
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:15,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

398
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:21,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say I was an Undertow fan, but, you know, it's hard to bitch when something's free.

399
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,235
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really hard to complain.

400
00:26:23,655 --> 00:26:30,278
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I think about Totem Ball and Yaris, and there's been some real shit free games on Xbox Live.

401
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,900
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, like, Agent's Wing wasn't bad.

402
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,461
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.

403
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,382
[SPEAKER_06]: It was no Yaris.

404
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:37,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

405
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:40,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

406
00:26:40,643 --> 00:26:41,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Yaris is unforgivable.

407
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:43,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I will never buy a Yaris because of that.

408
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:46,443
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah, they suck.

409
00:26:47,804 --> 00:26:59,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a rumor that there's going to be a price cut coming for European Xbox 360s and apparently the price cut is supposed to happen on March 14th.

410
00:26:59,691 --> 00:27:05,694
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a price cut of 50 euros and I guess we'll see if this actually happens.

411
00:27:05,814 --> 00:27:12,458
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being reported by TechRadar and apparently they got the news of a new SKU

412
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:19,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Numerous well-placed game industry sources, they said, have confirmed it.

413
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would bring the price, I guess, of the 360 to 250 euros for the arcade pack, and around 150 euros for the 360, and then the arcade would be 197 euros.

414
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:35,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

415
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:42,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that happens, but I guess we'll find out soon if that's the case.

416
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:44,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, price cuts aren't a bad thing.

417
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:48,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I cannot think of a story where we've talked about a price cut and it was a bad thing.

418
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So... I'm thinking.

419
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:56,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Loki, the devil's advocate here on the program, trying to think of something.

420
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:57,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's the chat as well.

421
00:27:57,965 --> 00:28:00,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you think about that while I report on this.

422
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:02,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Other worldly news.

423
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Asia is finally going to be getting Guitar Hero.

424
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:08,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's kind of interesting...

425
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard is actually going to be helping the game actually come to Asia, because you know how Activision just recently combined with Blizzard?

426
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:23,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Blizzard has the institutional expertise to bring Guitar Hero to places like China and Korea.

427
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:26,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you kind of think about it, Blizzard did launch World of Warcraft.

428
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:27,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how they're doing it.

429
00:28:27,712 --> 00:28:27,912
[SPEAKER_03]: How?

430
00:28:28,212 --> 00:28:33,195
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have it where if you play the game well enough, you gain experience in World of Warcraft on your account.

431
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:33,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

432
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:34,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

433
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:35,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

434
00:28:36,508 --> 00:29:05,841
[SPEAKER_06]: apparently the Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has also said this he's brought up the possibility of maybe putting other instruments in Guitar Hero which would be no surprise if you remember our story on DJ Heroes I've got a totally great idea this has never been attempted ever before we're gonna put singing and drums in the game and guess what we also may put keyboards never been done before in the face of the earth we are the first and then we're gonna have a turntable and five to seven keys they need a zither hero

435
00:29:07,338 --> 00:29:08,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want Sitar Hero.

436
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:11,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are our awards for originality and innovation?

437
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me Didgeridoo Hero.

438
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,121
[SPEAKER_06]: That's original.

439
00:29:21,704 --> 00:29:22,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Didgeridoo Hero would rock.

440
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:23,845
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know it.

441
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:26,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

442
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:28,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Clarinet Hero.

443
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,812
[SPEAKER_10]: to continue on though with Guitar Hero information for Guitar Hero 3 in time for St.

444
00:29:35,852 --> 00:29:59,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Patrick's Day there is going to be a pack with stuff by Dropkick Murphys which is pretty cool there will be Famous for Nothing Flanagan's Ball and Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya so that's pretty cool and also right now there's a Modern Metal pack out though that has some cool stuff on it too how very holiday appropriate

445
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:04,580
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an interesting... I like Dropkick Murphys, but I like Flogging Molly better.

446
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:06,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would have gone with them.

447
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:14,911
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was on YouTube looking for didgeridoo clips so I could, you know, hypothesize what didgeridoo hero might sound like.

448
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:19,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, I've never heard this, but this says didgeridoo techno.

449
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:20,957
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be horrible.

450
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:23,795
That's pretty sweet.

451
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:24,695
That's actually pretty fucking rad.

452
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:25,315
That is really cool.

453
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:28,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, this aboriginal guy on the streets, he actually, this is live.

454
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:30,997
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually has a little techno thing and he's playing the tree doodles.

455
00:30:31,017 --> 00:30:31,297
I'd buy that.

456
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:32,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I would buy that in a heartbeat.

457
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:55,575
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fucking sweet.

458
00:30:55,655 --> 00:30:56,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So hardcore.

459
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:57,356
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

460
00:30:57,596 --> 00:30:58,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that song.

461
00:30:58,396 --> 00:30:59,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I am going to link that YouTube.

462
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:00,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Search for it.

463
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:02,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Didgeridoo Techno on YouTube.

464
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:03,158
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty sweet.

465
00:31:03,198 --> 00:31:10,160
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know how to spell Didgeridoo, D-I-D-G-E-R-I-D-O-O I'm going to put that in my favorites on YouTube.

466
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was pretty rad.

467
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll actually put that in the OLR favorites right now.

468
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:15,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Check that out.

469
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,062
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.

470
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:22,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sorry, we can go back to real gaming news now.

471
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll stop the didgeridoo.

472
00:31:25,098 --> 00:31:27,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, man, this guy needs to put out a fucking album.

473
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, we need to get him on the show.

474
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:36,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a new, I mean, with all due respect to Middy Head and the great OLR theme he made us, he's an awesome guy.

475
00:31:36,783 --> 00:31:42,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think it's time to maybe get a fresh Orange Lounge Radio theme in here and I demand didgeridoo in the theme.

476
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:43,466
[SPEAKER_10]: And auto-harp.

477
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody needs to make that happen.

478
00:31:47,308 --> 00:31:48,829
[SPEAKER_06]: That is fucking awesome.

479
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:49,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

480
00:31:50,794 --> 00:31:54,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, with Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.

481
00:32:10,492 --> 00:32:10,892
[SPEAKER_03]: PS3, SingStar Volume 2

482
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:40,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So Australia may see another SingStar game.

483
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:43,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we over here in the United States are still waiting for the first SingStar game.

484
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:46,426
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have a clip of one of the new songs from SingStar.

485
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,408
Okay, I promise that's the last time.

486
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:48,609
Um...

487
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,585
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

488
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:32,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, snap, because, you know, have you heard that?

489
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:36,667
[SPEAKER_06]: That the ESRB, actually, the publishers send information to the ESRB.

490
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:37,848
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't always play the games.

491
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:40,329
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of, I swear that's how it works.

492
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:40,829
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very interesting.

493
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:42,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know they can't play it all the way through.

494
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:51,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually they get a clip or a video of, like, gameplay footage that's, you know, supposed to be the most violent or, you know, obscene stuff in the game.

495
00:33:51,455 --> 00:33:51,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

496
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:54,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'd make their ratings based on that.

497
00:33:54,511 --> 00:33:58,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is why things like Hot Coffee were so controversial, because that was omitted.

498
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:01,135
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, we're not going to go over that whole thing again.

499
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:02,676
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyhow, here's the other big thing.

500
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:10,682
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy also says that sequels are not judged on their own merits, but rather the merits of the games before it.

501
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:13,246
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

502
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:40,631
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be a huge kick in the face if a lot of this is true.

503
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:43,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've already come out and said, oh, well, blah, blah, blah.

504
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,254
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't support his views and all that stuff.

505
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,814
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the ECB.

506
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:48,415
[SPEAKER_03]: We're awesome.

507
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:49,175
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of thing.

508
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:51,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Those sound like fair requests to me, though.

509
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:54,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's just me, but it sounds very fair to me.

510
00:34:54,097 --> 00:34:56,218
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about those revelations, DarkSakura?

511
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:57,619
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is this going to— I'm not at all surprised.

512
00:34:58,299 --> 00:34:59,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but, I mean—

513
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:07,866
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of rely on the ESRB as gamers when these games come out and all these horrible things happen.

514
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:09,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the butt story from Burnout earlier.

515
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:13,048
[SPEAKER_06]: We go, well, the ESRB did say the rating is subject to change.

516
00:35:13,308 --> 00:35:17,770
[SPEAKER_06]: But if the ESRB gets discredited with stuff like this, this really screws us in a way.

517
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:18,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

518
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:19,891
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of sad.

519
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:25,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly think it's sort of a corrupt institution anyway.

520
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:29,015
[SPEAKER_06]: RawSteelUT has said that Patricia Vance has already come out and denied it.

521
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:29,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

522
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:31,909
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems like a given, though.

523
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:35,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, take it as a rumor for now, but it certainly is a question.

524
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:44,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I have heard from inside folks, and I'm pretty sure it's out there on the internet also, that ESRB doesn't necessarily play through the games.

525
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:47,793
[SPEAKER_06]: They will rate based on stuff that you send them.

526
00:35:48,334 --> 00:35:49,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

527
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:54,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember overhearing at a trade show once about people, and I think you were there too, Loki.

528
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:59,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you ever heard this same conversation, but about how a particular game I'm thinking of, a particular game

529
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:03,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even want to say because I don't want people to speculate.

530
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:14,363
[SPEAKER_06]: But a particular game, I heard the developer joking with another really big industry press person about how they got this through the ESRB with a particular rating.

531
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:16,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I just was kind of shocked to hear that kind of talk.

532
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:18,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

533
00:36:25,512 --> 00:36:28,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to move away from the ESRB and how crappy they are.

534
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:28,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's.

535
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:29,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please.

536
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:33,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Skype is actually coming out on Japanese PSPs this month.

537
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:34,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

538
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:42,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So it will be on March 18th, and it's only, of course, for the Slim PSP, the newer one.

539
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:45,575
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's supposed to be a month later over here in the U.S.

540
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:53,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, the microphone attachment is going to be 2,500 yen, or two for 4,000.

541
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:54,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

542
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:57,863
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's not bad.

543
00:36:58,564 --> 00:36:59,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad at all.

544
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:02,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that Japanese PSP users will get to use this.

545
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:03,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Good call.

546
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:05,870
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll be able to do it a month later.

547
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,111
[SPEAKER_06]: We already have it.

548
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:12,313
[SPEAKER_06]: We got our first call last week on the Skype line from a Skype PSP user.

549
00:37:16,074 --> 00:37:25,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is going to be due out here next month and they have released the full list of cars and tracks that are going to be included in that.

550
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:28,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of different stuff you can pick from.

551
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe

552
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:48,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it, I want to say like 65 cars and 6 tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit, the Eiger Nordwand, Fuji Speedway, London City Track, Daytona International Speedway, and the High Speed Ring.

553
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:53,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bunch of different cars, I don't even know what to even cover on that, but

554
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:58,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of stuff to keep you satisfied until the full game comes out.

555
00:37:58,614 --> 00:38:06,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it's going to have a brand new drift mode for the US version, as well as the ability to fine-tune your car, and two-player split-screen racing.

556
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I guess, a new set of events.

557
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:11,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad for $40.

558
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:18,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not just Prologue, that's the full game, right?

559
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:19,607
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's Prologue.

560
00:38:20,288 --> 00:38:21,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's just Prologue.

561
00:38:21,388 --> 00:38:21,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

562
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:22,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

563
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:22,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

564
00:38:22,588 --> 00:38:23,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

565
00:38:53,072 --> 00:38:53,973
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

566
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Although my dentist is pretty cool.

567
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:26,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how much money I would pay for a YouTube of Loki playing All-Star Cheer Squad?

568
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:28,389
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no money in the world.

569
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that'll be the next bet.

570
00:39:31,851 --> 00:39:38,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever we find another bet for Loki to take on, we'll get him to play All-Star Cheer Squad in the Tingle outfit.

571
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:44,257
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to make this happen somehow.

572
00:39:44,895 --> 00:39:48,577
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be opening the Skype line after this next story.

573
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:52,379
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

574
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and give us a call after this story.

575
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:12,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for people who were fans of the Castlevania series and collect action figures, it doesn't look like we're going to really be getting the new figures that they were discussing.

576
00:40:12,471 --> 00:40:12,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

577
00:40:14,143 --> 00:40:30,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, basically, they were saying, they were asked if there were going to be any more in that Castlevania line and it was reported that there were no plans at all and no news on Castlevania figures and that they will not be revisiting the license.

578
00:40:32,911 --> 00:40:33,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's kind of a bummer.

579
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:35,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a Richter figure, dang it.

580
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:36,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Richter.

581
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:39,514
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to say it, you have to say it right.

582
00:40:39,714 --> 00:40:40,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Richter.

583
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:40,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Richter.

584
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:43,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Skypline is open.

585
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:45,585
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

586
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:48,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

587
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,928
[SPEAKER_06]: While we're waiting for some calls, how about some last-minute stories?

588
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything for us tonight, Loki?

589
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't.

590
00:40:58,311 --> 00:40:58,591
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

591
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:00,272
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually covered everything?

592
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:03,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I'm sure there's some other stuff.

593
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:04,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank God a call's coming in.

594
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:07,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

595
00:41:07,816 --> 00:41:08,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

596
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:11,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Ross TLUT.

597
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:13,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me shut the speakers down.

598
00:41:13,444 --> 00:41:13,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.

599
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:14,625
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's all right.

600
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:15,726
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, Ross TLUT?

601
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:17,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

602
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:24,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to talk about the whole thing with the guy whose 360 got wiped clean.

603
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:28,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then Bungie actually had to fix it and all that stuff.

604
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:29,975
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your thoughts on that?

605
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:34,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, much love to Bungie, but where the fuck is Microsoft?

606
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:38,220
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they were going to help the guy, and then we haven't heard from them since.

607
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:38,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

608
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:42,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but isn't Bungie, like, oh no, because they split.

609
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:56,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep wanting to say, oh, but Bungie is partially... Well, they split, but still, it wasn't Bungie's fault, it was the... And that's the thing, this wasn't, this isn't some sort of little casual accident, because, from what I understand, the console was marked as permanent marker.

610
00:41:57,418 --> 00:42:03,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you had to, whoever did this had to really, you know, get in there, you know what I mean?

611
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:06,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I always thought that they just gave the console a different shell.

612
00:42:07,954 --> 00:42:10,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they all go through some sort of power wash.

613
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:41,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a high pressure wash.

614
00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:43,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's going to make your Xbox look new again?

615
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:44,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

616
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:45,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, yeah.

617
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,224
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

618
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:49,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if... Oh my gosh.

619
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:53,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, and you can see... Oh, thanks for the link to the blog.

620
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:54,068
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

621
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:56,609
[SPEAKER_06]: You can totally see how some of the ink is just like rubbed off.

622
00:42:57,398 --> 00:43:01,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's like how you might put like your ring or something.

623
00:43:01,181 --> 00:43:07,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm thinking last weekend I watched my friend get her engagement ring washed and they have like a machine that does it, you know, make it look new again.

624
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:10,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like kind of that type of thing, make sure Xbox 360 look new again.

625
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:11,609
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird.

626
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

627
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not surprised by Microsoft having incompetent tech support.

628
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:25,780
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, after I had my 360 sent in early November and I got a refurb and it took me...

629
00:43:26,913 --> 00:43:30,696
[SPEAKER_08]: 4 months to finally get my XBLA games revalidated to the console.

630
00:43:31,357 --> 00:43:34,239
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, neither of them ever buying anything off the marketplace again.

631
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:35,340
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a big mess.

632
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:43,427
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when I sent my Xbox 360 back, thankfully I only had two arcade games purchased at the time, and they're not ones I play super... Well, I take that back.

633
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:47,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Joust was one, I haven't played that in a while, but Geometry Wars was the other.

634
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:52,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, I haven't had much issues, because since it is tied to your Xbox Live name, it recognizes me, you know, and all that stuff.

635
00:43:53,455 --> 00:43:56,916
[SPEAKER_06]: and it lets me play the full version but I do have to wait like a couple seconds.

636
00:43:56,976 --> 00:44:04,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean obviously I'm not going to get frustrated over a couple seconds but I'm just thinking like I've heard of other people who've lost a lot more than two arcade games and it's just a pain in the ass.

637
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:11,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Well the problem with XBLA is that you cannot play your stuff offline if you do a refurb.

638
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:13,941
[SPEAKER_08]: You know...

639
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:16,602
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to be online at all times.

640
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:19,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And like a couple of days ago, my internet was on the fritz and I couldn't do that.

641
00:44:19,543 --> 00:44:24,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, there goes Geometry Wars, there goes Symphony of the Night, Contra, you know, a few others.

642
00:44:24,604 --> 00:44:25,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

643
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:28,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkTetsuya points out that this isn't just a Microsoft thing.

644
00:44:28,725 --> 00:44:31,365
[SPEAKER_06]: He says in chat, it's the same with Virtual Console.

645
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,486
[SPEAKER_06]: When I got my Wii back, I had to re-download them, but they didn't cost extra.

646
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:35,406
[SPEAKER_06]: They were free to replace.

647
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not so bad.

648
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:37,587
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it worked then.

649
00:44:37,647 --> 00:44:40,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, at least you can use them without being online.

650
00:44:40,307 --> 00:44:41,127
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the important thing.

651
00:44:41,187 --> 00:44:42,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

652
00:44:42,048 --> 00:44:44,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if I got to download it again, sure, whatever.

653
00:44:45,129 --> 00:44:57,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but this just struck me as an especially evil thing to do to somebody, you know, because there's no reason to do that, especially as the guy said, hey, I don't want my, um, I don't want my thing cleaned, you know?

654
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:11,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I would understand, like, if Microsoft did this whole, like, power wash thing, and, you know, they didn't, you know, I could understand how they might miss the special request, and just everything goes on the assembly line, they don't pay really any attention to it, it's, you know, fixed line, fixed...

655
00:45:12,111 --> 00:45:15,993
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Microsoft should at least come out and let us know publicly that that's what happened.

656
00:45:16,453 --> 00:45:19,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Microsoft is so out there in the community.

657
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:20,354
[SPEAKER_06]: They worked really hard.

658
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:24,476
[SPEAKER_06]: They have Gamerscore Blog, Major Nelson, and all these people.

659
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:29,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure these people are aware of this negative story being out there on the blog.

660
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:34,580
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really think Microsoft will say something about it eventually and kind of admit, oops, my bad.

661
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,461
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is that Microsoft...

662
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:39,738
[SPEAKER_08]: for everything they do in the community.

663
00:45:39,758 --> 00:45:41,439
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a million horror stories.

664
00:45:41,799 --> 00:45:44,340
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the alarming amount of red rings.

665
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:50,823
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the nightmare with getting your stuff validated on your console so you can use it offline again.

666
00:45:51,364 --> 00:45:51,984
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's this.

667
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:57,246
[SPEAKER_08]: It really makes you wonder if the left hand even knows what the right hand is doing.

668
00:45:57,327 --> 00:45:58,467
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to bet, though?

669
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:06,171
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why Bungie did this for this guy is that somebody at Microsoft saw this story on the blogs, their community outreach people, and made a phone call.

670
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:10,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they were like, yeah, could you help us out here?

671
00:46:10,584 --> 00:46:11,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

672
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:12,806
[SPEAKER_06]: We fucked up.

673
00:46:12,826 --> 00:46:13,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you save our ass?

674
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:15,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.

675
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:29,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, on better Microsoft news, the Financial Times is reporting that Microsoft might be considering more Blu-ray support.

676
00:46:30,131 --> 00:46:32,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people have even speculated a Blu-ray draw for the 360.

677
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:43,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I have heard about that, that Microsoft is supposedly in talks with Sony about the whole Blu-ray add-on, which is a very strange kind of marriage, but I guess one step that Microsoft might have to make at this point.

678
00:46:43,897 --> 00:46:44,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, might have to make.

679
00:46:44,997 --> 00:46:45,978
[SPEAKER_08]: They do have to make.

680
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:47,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, do they?

681
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:53,981
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to understand the majority of people on a console at the end aren't going to be online.

682
00:46:56,144 --> 00:46:58,407
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to have the offline option.

683
00:46:58,627 --> 00:47:00,049
[SPEAKER_06]: How come the Wii doesn't have to do it?

684
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the Wii is not being marketed as a media center.

685
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:08,321
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had this conversation before.

686
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:08,782
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being...

687
00:47:10,176 --> 00:47:13,298
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being marketed on, oh, look at the cute little novelty controller, you know.

688
00:47:13,378 --> 00:47:25,827
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, as you start adding in, you know, the forecast channel, the news channel, the weather, I'm sorry, I just said the same thing, the TV guide channel, all this other stuff, it's a different type of center of sorts.

689
00:47:27,768 --> 00:47:28,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

690
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:37,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't see the marketing in the sort of multimedia center of the home thing, you know.

691
00:47:38,052 --> 00:48:06,845
[SPEAKER_08]: and I agree with Frisbee I don't need it to be but you know it's you know also Microsoft but it makes it appealing the reason that might stop this is that Microsoft doesn't want to be seen as admitting picking a losing side you know they pretty much had to give away those HD DVD add-ons which I thought was funny you know what I gotta wrap up so we can get some other calls but here's the thing I would kind of close on this I would bet that Microsoft doesn't end up doing it and they'll just build it into their next system

692
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:14,211
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my guess, the 720 would be... I mean, I would imagine both the 720 and the PS4 would be Blu-ray.

693
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:17,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and we're probably years off from both, but I think you're right.

694
00:48:17,753 --> 00:48:22,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if they do talk to him about Blu-ray, I think it'll wait until the next Xbox system.

695
00:48:24,577 --> 00:48:25,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

696
00:48:25,158 --> 00:48:28,900
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to let you go, Rusty, because we've got to get some other calls, but thanks so much for your call.

697
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:29,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

698
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:30,581
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, have a good one.

699
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:31,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

700
00:48:32,062 --> 00:48:33,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

701
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:37,986
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

702
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,463
[SPEAKER_06]: That call was seven minutes.

703
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to limit him to about four.

704
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:42,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

705
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:42,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

706
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, it's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.

707
00:48:45,328 --> 00:48:45,608
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?

708
00:48:45,648 --> 00:48:47,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore from Ultimate Quest.

709
00:48:47,249 --> 00:48:49,131
[SPEAKER_06]: How are things doing on the Ultimate Quest, Xenocore?

710
00:48:49,972 --> 00:49:01,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've been sort of hectic considering we've been on and off on our weekends, mainly because I went to MegaCon this last weekend up in Orlando and doing a little bit of coverage here and there.

711
00:49:02,102 --> 00:49:04,784
[SPEAKER_00]: My first one, actually, I just popped a conch area on MegaCon.

712
00:49:05,845 --> 00:49:06,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that out.

713
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:06,886
[SPEAKER_00]: What an interesting...

714
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:09,561
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the website again for folks who want to check out that?

715
00:49:11,262 --> 00:49:12,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the convention or for our show?

716
00:49:13,103 --> 00:49:13,503
[SPEAKER_00]: For the show.

717
00:49:14,664 --> 00:49:16,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the show is at ultimatequest.net.

718
00:49:18,447 --> 00:49:20,908
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear about something on it last week since I missed recording.

719
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get back till late this evening.

720
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,292
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, man, Megacon was something else.

721
00:49:26,352 --> 00:49:26,912
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness.

722
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you called in to talk about tonight was Megacon?

723
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:29,114
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

724
00:49:29,894 --> 00:49:30,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.

725
00:49:30,575 --> 00:49:35,478
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on top of that, they had the first Smash Brothers tournament I happened to catch, which is kind of interesting.

726
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:38,038
[SPEAKER_00]: The cosplayers, man.

727
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:42,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't ready for that level of dedication at all.

728
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, there's some cosplayers that are so good at what they do.

729
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:47,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It is astounding.

730
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,383
[SPEAKER_06]: That's love right there.

731
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:51,085
[SPEAKER_06]: What were some of the cool cosplays you saw, Xenocor?

732
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:54,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got to mention this one that stood out for everything.

733
00:49:54,406 --> 00:50:01,050
[SPEAKER_00]: A 14-year-old girl doing the Mighty Edward from Cowboy Bebop in character all three days.

734
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Laptop on her head the entire time.

735
00:50:04,712 --> 00:50:04,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

736
00:50:04,872 --> 00:50:05,492
[SPEAKER_00]: That was impressive.

737
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:06,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Lost Odyssey

738
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:20,807
[SPEAKER_00]: We on our show did not.

739
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:24,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Henderson Man actually spoke up for the show to review that one.

740
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't grabbed it yet.

741
00:50:26,811 --> 00:50:30,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kind of curious because I know you guys kind of specialize in the role-playing games.

742
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:34,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious, and maybe I'll have to wait until you guys tape a future episode.

743
00:50:34,257 --> 00:50:40,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious of your general thoughts on the game because the critics overall kind of dogged it a little bit, but I'm in love with it.

744
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a fantastic game.

745
00:50:43,471 --> 00:50:49,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the main thing that caught my attention is something Henderson mentioned, is that you can't out-level the bosses in Lost Odyssey.

746
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:54,663
[SPEAKER_00]: The bosses level according to what level you are, so the bosses are always difficult.

747
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:55,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

748
00:50:55,364 --> 00:50:57,066
[SPEAKER_06]: No wonder there's such pains in the ass.

749
00:50:57,306 --> 00:50:57,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

750
00:50:58,307 --> 00:50:58,888
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't level.

751
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,378
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't level?

752
00:51:00,678 --> 00:51:07,562
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because there's actually some guides out there, the Prima guides and stuff, that tell you what level you should be at to play the boss.

753
00:51:07,963 --> 00:51:11,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you would have to grind a little bit, you can't just go from one boss to the next.

754
00:51:11,865 --> 00:51:17,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it maybe because even though the bosses level up, you get more skills, so it makes it easier regardless?

755
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:24,734
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be my thought, is that maybe, yeah, the bosses are leveling up, but since you get more skills, you get power on them that way, if that makes sense.

756
00:51:26,015 --> 00:51:27,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a large part of the game is skills.

757
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:33,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've got so far is based on Henderson Man's review.

758
00:51:34,751 --> 00:51:37,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be playing it myself sooner or later as soon as a budget allows for it.

759
00:51:38,694 --> 00:51:41,356
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, I can only go by word of mouth pretty much.

760
00:51:42,117 --> 00:51:44,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Xenocore.

761
00:51:44,098 --> 00:51:48,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had to ask because it's been a large part of my gaming time lately.

762
00:51:48,702 --> 00:51:49,683
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did you call in to talk about?

763
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:50,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

764
00:51:50,904 --> 00:51:56,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, mainly it was just that I happened to come across my first con and decided to share it with fellow con lovers, so.

765
00:51:57,552 --> 00:52:03,014
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while since I've been to a con, but definitely we have Fanime coming up in May or June, right?

766
00:52:03,034 --> 00:52:03,554
[SPEAKER_06]: When's Fanime?

767
00:52:03,574 --> 00:52:04,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Memorial Day weekend, Fanime?

768
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:06,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is.

769
00:52:06,175 --> 00:52:09,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I'm probably not going this year.

770
00:52:09,736 --> 00:52:11,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is it the same time as your road trip?

771
00:52:12,317 --> 00:52:12,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

772
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:13,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

773
00:52:14,057 --> 00:52:17,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh, well, that's a bummer, because we always do our show there.

774
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,159
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's see.

775
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:22,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's other cons coming up, and I still want to go to that one in Chicago.

776
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:23,880
[SPEAKER_06]: ASIN, is that it?

777
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want to go to ASIN.

778
00:52:25,621 --> 00:52:25,981
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

779
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:26,421
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

780
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,559
[SPEAKER_10]: and I have information on that too.

781
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:30,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

782
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:31,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Later then.

783
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Later it is.

784
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:36,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore, anything else before I let you go?

785
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:41,005
[SPEAKER_00]: That and the largest Yuri-Yowie argument I've ever heard in my entire life.

786
00:52:41,065 --> 00:52:42,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, that was fine.

787
00:52:44,347 --> 00:52:46,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Some things you can never escape at cons.

788
00:52:47,148 --> 00:52:48,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go to YowieCon.

789
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:49,770
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing is an argument.

790
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:54,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore, thanks so much for your call and have a good one and good luck with your own show.

791
00:52:55,748 --> 00:52:56,548
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, take it easy, guys.

792
00:52:56,768 --> 00:52:57,048
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

793
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:57,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

794
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,669
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly is the Yuri-Yowie argument?

795
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:01,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, hold on.

796
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask our next caller.

797
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:03,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

798
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:04,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

799
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:05,491
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

800
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:06,331
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care who it is.

801
00:53:07,391 --> 00:53:08,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care who it is.

802
00:53:08,231 --> 00:53:12,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to ask you, DJ Ranma S, I want to ask you, what is the Yuri-Yowie argument?

803
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.

804
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:20,935
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly is the Yuri-Yowie argument?

805
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:26,313
[SPEAKER_01]: You got these fangirls who argue about what's better, Yuri or Yaoi.

806
00:53:26,653 --> 00:53:28,794
[SPEAKER_01]: They run around with these paddles.

807
00:53:28,814 --> 00:53:32,356
[SPEAKER_01]: They will start smacking you with them if you do not agree with them.

808
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:33,977
[SPEAKER_10]: This is true.

809
00:53:33,997 --> 00:53:38,080
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I said going to YaoiCon is like a whole argument in and of itself.

810
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,563
[SPEAKER_01]: My other friend Jasmine, she has this priestess outfit.

811
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:49,246
[SPEAKER_01]: She walks around with an anti-Yaoi paper fan that she smacks people with.

812
00:53:50,472 --> 00:53:51,973
[SPEAKER_06]: That is nothing short of amazing.

813
00:53:52,053 --> 00:53:53,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how else to describe it.

814
00:53:53,695 --> 00:53:55,696
[SPEAKER_06]: But they yell at each other.

815
00:53:55,716 --> 00:53:59,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this sounds like stupid fun, but they actually get upset over this.

816
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:03,163
[SPEAKER_06]: They really do think they're going to beat it into you to yell at you.

817
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:05,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them do.

818
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:14,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a couple of years back at Animazement, we had like this line of people on one side, you had the ninjas, you had on the other side the pirates.

819
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:18,029
[SPEAKER_01]: We were shouting back and forth, ninjas were better or pirates were better.

820
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:20,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It got to the point where staff had to break us all up.

821
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:27,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe about an hour later, we started a conga line singing ninja rap all throughout the entire convention area.

822
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Cons are so weird.

823
00:54:28,635 --> 00:54:30,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was...

824
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:36,850
[SPEAKER_10]: The funny thing about Anime Expo every year is that wherever they schedule it, they also schedule some sort of religious convention.

825
00:54:37,911 --> 00:54:40,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So you get the people preaching to the cosplayers in line.

826
00:54:42,213 --> 00:54:50,236
[SPEAKER_10]: And one year a bunch of us just started just completely telling them off in various other languages that weren't necessarily Japanese.

827
00:54:52,037 --> 00:54:55,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people that would pay a lot of money to see women beat each other up with paddles.

828
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can get this all for free at your local anime convention.

829
00:55:01,638 --> 00:55:04,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much, and Jamie, there is a voice actor.

830
00:55:04,659 --> 00:55:05,539
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Vic.

831
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:06,879
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like a born-again Christian.

832
00:55:06,899 --> 00:55:08,460
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the voice of Ed from FMA.

833
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:15,722
[SPEAKER_01]: At AnimeCon, he has like a panel of Sunday morning service for con goers to come and arrive for service.

834
00:55:16,742 --> 00:55:18,263
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool.

835
00:55:18,563 --> 00:55:19,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's kind of neat.

836
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:21,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen that happen at various conventions.

837
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:23,784
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for people that want to do that, why not?

838
00:55:24,484 --> 00:55:24,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

839
00:55:26,005 --> 00:55:26,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

840
00:55:27,784 --> 00:55:34,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's another quote that I love from RossDLUT in chat says, This is different from console fanboys how?

841
00:55:36,228 --> 00:55:39,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox, Playstation, Xbox, Playstation, Wii!

842
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:50,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about you guys, but I'd rather see a bunch of girls in cute outfits screaming Yaoi versus Yuri than a bunch of fanboys shouting what console is better, you know?

843
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:51,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to agree with you there.

844
00:55:52,338 --> 00:55:52,558
Yeah.

845
00:55:53,618 --> 00:55:56,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

846
00:55:57,225 --> 00:55:57,866
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things.

847
00:55:58,766 --> 00:56:00,568
[SPEAKER_01]: The 360 with the missing autographs.

848
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:03,710
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was me, I would have bit the bullet and bought a new console.

849
00:56:04,631 --> 00:56:04,851
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

850
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:06,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have done the same thing.

851
00:56:07,673 --> 00:56:09,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly what I would have done.

852
00:56:11,075 --> 00:56:12,737
[SPEAKER_06]: But they gave him back the console.

853
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:14,698
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem wasn't that he didn't have a working console.

854
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:15,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

855
00:56:15,479 --> 00:56:16,860
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't have left that to fate.

856
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not have put in something that valuable in the hands of other people.

857
00:56:20,823 --> 00:56:21,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

858
00:56:21,403 --> 00:56:21,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

859
00:56:22,104 --> 00:56:24,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would never have sent the console in to be repaired in the first place.

860
00:56:25,598 --> 00:56:26,199
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

861
00:56:46,605 --> 00:56:47,246
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

862
00:56:47,306 --> 00:56:50,689
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I got into Prodigy during the age of Windows and stuff like that.

863
00:56:50,749 --> 00:56:51,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

864
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:52,091
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I got into.

865
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:52,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, no.

866
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:53,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Prodigy.

867
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:55,374
[SPEAKER_01]: You go way old school, yeah.

868
00:56:55,494 --> 00:57:00,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I had DOS-based Prodigy, HWPD42B.

869
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:06,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Radio Shack stores had Prodigy set up for people for free to try out and stuff.

870
00:57:06,085 --> 00:57:06,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

871
00:57:06,665 --> 00:57:08,307
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we found out about it the first time.

872
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:11,648
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know what happened to Prodigy, right?

873
00:57:12,649 --> 00:57:16,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they get absolved into, basically they're like an ISP now, aren't they?

874
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:18,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they're a part of Yahoo, aren't they?

875
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:22,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, they're like the red-headed bastard stepchild of AT&T.

876
00:57:23,053 --> 00:57:30,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Like about one or two years ago they were trying to sell off the name of everybody and the whole thing to the highest bidder and they're still trying to do that.

877
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,800
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

878
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,721
[SPEAKER_06]: ColecoVision Adam Which is ironic if people know you very well

879
00:57:58,387 --> 00:57:58,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

880
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:00,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you guys later.

881
00:58:01,651 --> 00:58:02,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, Ranma.

882
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:03,332
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

883
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:03,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

884
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:05,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Or should I say ColecoVision?

885
00:58:05,955 --> 00:58:06,255
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

886
00:58:07,957 --> 00:58:08,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Colecoman!

887
00:58:09,058 --> 00:58:11,100
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call.

888
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,002
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

889
00:58:13,082 --> 00:58:14,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

890
00:58:15,604 --> 00:58:20,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, I did actually get a last-minute news story from somebody.

891
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:22,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is it?

892
00:58:24,677 --> 00:58:35,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Video game companies think they might be able to survive the slowing down of the economy.

893
00:58:35,864 --> 00:58:41,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently video games have defied the sagging retail sales figures of December 2007.

894
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:46,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo actually talked to CNBC, specifically Reggie Fils-Aimé,

895
00:58:46,713 --> 00:58:50,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say I have a couple last minute stories for after this.

896
00:58:50,674 --> 00:58:51,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is Osferd.

897
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:17,131
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's all right.

898
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:37,486
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's just pretty interesting with the whole Yowie Yuri argument, and I'm actually going to be going to my first convention in May, so I'll be sure to look out for that.

899
00:59:38,426 --> 00:59:38,906
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

900
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:42,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just avoid the women that have the Yowie Yuri paddles unless you're into that.

901
00:59:42,627 --> 00:59:43,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And watch out for the free hugs.

902
00:59:43,988 --> 00:59:45,068
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know if they've been tested.

903
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:48,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if somebody's wearing a glomp sign, run the other way.

904
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:54,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to experience full on, so I'm actually going to go run towards them for the heck of it.

905
00:59:55,671 --> 00:59:57,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, don't say we didn't warn you, bud.

906
00:59:57,572 --> 00:59:59,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Rama wants to know what con it is.

907
01:00:00,925 --> 01:00:03,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think it's, I think it's Anime Central.

908
01:00:03,947 --> 01:00:04,708
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in Illinois.

909
01:00:04,728 --> 01:00:05,768
[SPEAKER_10]: That's ASIN.

910
01:00:05,788 --> 01:00:07,169
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one that we're wanting to go to.

911
01:00:07,189 --> 01:00:08,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're thinking about going.

912
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,111
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big one.

913
01:00:10,131 --> 01:00:11,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

914
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:11,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

915
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:12,293
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

916
01:00:12,393 --> 01:00:12,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

917
01:00:12,653 --> 01:00:14,934
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably too late to get a panel on that and all that stuff.

918
01:00:14,954 --> 01:00:15,315
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

919
01:00:15,815 --> 01:00:16,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily.

920
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:17,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

921
01:00:17,216 --> 01:00:18,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we might have to make that happen.

922
01:00:18,797 --> 01:00:22,159
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, we could always do the, uh, OLR Hospitality Suite or something silly.

923
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:22,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

924
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:23,180
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll think of something.

925
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:23,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

926
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:24,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

927
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:24,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

928
01:00:25,592 --> 01:00:28,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just been playing lots of Brawl What are your thoughts on Brawl?

929
01:00:28,153 --> 01:00:28,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they get it right?

930
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:29,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it worth the wait?

931
01:00:29,734 --> 01:00:31,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd say it's definitely worth the wait

932
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:56,536
[SPEAKER_09]: But like really my only frustration is with the online play.

933
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:59,818
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just can't freaking connect and play against anyone.

934
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:03,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your Wii far away from your Wi-Fi router?

935
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:07,503
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's only like 10 feet away from it.

936
01:01:07,924 --> 01:01:08,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, weird.

937
01:01:09,096 --> 01:01:11,237
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I did play online.

938
01:01:11,277 --> 01:01:12,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten the friends thing to work.

939
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:14,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try tonight after the show.

940
01:01:14,959 --> 01:01:23,985
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have heard, or I did play the random people one, which is a little silly because it's just like playing the computer pretty much, except you know somebody real is controlling it.

941
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:25,826
[SPEAKER_06]: But it wasn't bad.

942
01:01:25,866 --> 01:01:27,907
[SPEAKER_06]: It was relatively lag-free, so I was pretty excited.

943
01:01:28,867 --> 01:01:30,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

944
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:37,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I just kept on getting error codes and ads saying, and it would just cut me out, saying the transmission has ended or something like that.

945
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:38,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just like, what the heck?

946
01:01:38,884 --> 01:01:41,446
[SPEAKER_09]: But I haven't actually tried doing it through friend code, so I don't know.

947
01:01:41,486 --> 01:01:42,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that'll work better.

948
01:01:42,747 --> 01:01:43,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

949
01:01:44,169 --> 01:01:44,429
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

950
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:46,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Osfer?

951
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:48,372
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's about it.

952
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:48,952
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

953
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:50,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks so much for the phone call.

954
01:01:50,634 --> 01:01:51,254
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a good week.

955
01:01:51,414 --> 01:01:55,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And try to take that Smash Brothers in limitation.

956
01:01:55,738 --> 01:01:56,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't OD on it, okay?

957
01:01:57,939 --> 01:01:58,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

958
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:58,660
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

959
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

960
01:02:00,401 --> 01:02:00,682
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

961
01:02:00,702 --> 01:02:00,902
[SPEAKER_09]: See you.

962
01:02:01,863 --> 01:02:02,283
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

963
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:04,329
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.

964
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:05,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for your calls.

965
01:02:05,629 --> 01:02:06,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you didn't get through tonight, don't worry.

966
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,010
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always next week.

967
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:10,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can always leave us a voicemail.

968
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:12,232
[SPEAKER_06]: We do play the voicemails once in a while.

969
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:16,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we didn't play them tonight, but we'll probably get to some more next week.

970
01:02:16,094 --> 01:02:17,915
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR whenever we're not live.

971
01:02:18,555 --> 01:02:20,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So you said you had some last-minute stories, Loki.

972
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:22,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, real quick here.

973
01:02:22,677 --> 01:02:23,198
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two things.

974
01:02:24,858 --> 01:02:28,860
[SPEAKER_03]: That show Dexter you may have heard about.

975
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,522
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually now starting to, I guess, replay it on the CVS.

976
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:42,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about a serial killer who, instead of going around killing other people, he goes around killing serial killers.

977
01:02:42,748 --> 01:02:44,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So they kind of fight his urge.

978
01:02:45,209 --> 01:02:48,631
[SPEAKER_03]: It's currently running Showtime, and apparently they're making a game from it.

979
01:02:49,571 --> 01:02:50,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of interesting.

980
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:53,914
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is the game Turning Point.

981
01:02:54,374 --> 01:02:59,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the reviews haven't been too good for it, and according to Turning Point's CEO...

982
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,192
[SPEAKER_03]: of the company Spark Unlimited.

983
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:08,796
[SPEAKER_03]: He's quoted that Turning Point is too high concept for reviewers.

984
01:03:09,876 --> 01:03:14,419
[SPEAKER_03]: They just... It wasn't for the critics, apparently.

985
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:26,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more, I guess, a game that was never meant for core gamers that is meant for those who aren't wanting to look at a game with a critical eye, I guess.

986
01:03:28,288 --> 01:03:28,548
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

987
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:33,616
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically saying that the game reviewers don't know how to review his game.

988
01:03:34,136 --> 01:03:36,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was supposed to be crappy, I guess.

989
01:03:37,257 --> 01:03:37,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

990
01:03:38,137 --> 01:03:38,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

991
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:41,279
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

992
01:03:41,899 --> 01:03:45,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I know his next game that they're doing, was it Legendary?

993
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,321
[SPEAKER_03]: That one that's by Gamecock, I guess?

994
01:03:47,421 --> 01:03:48,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Legendary the Box?

995
01:03:49,082 --> 01:03:50,102
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's just Legendary.

996
01:03:53,904 --> 01:03:54,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

997
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:56,925
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

998
01:03:57,386 --> 01:04:00,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that is going to do it, I guess, for tonight's Last Minute Stories.

999
01:04:00,427 --> 01:04:01,327
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for now.

1000
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:01,947
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1001
01:04:02,027 --> 01:04:05,288
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1002
01:04:05,788 --> 01:04:09,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting Independent Radio.

1003
01:04:09,329 --> 01:04:10,129
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are awesome.

1004
01:04:10,629 --> 01:04:13,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts.

1005
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:15,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And then actually, we're breaking form a little bit tonight.

1006
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:19,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one more story that's very important that we want to do at the very, very end.

1007
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:21,872
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts.

1008
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:22,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1009
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:51,669
[SPEAKER_03]: my final thought is I want to finish Space Emissary mode this week and god damn it I wish my 360 the other one I'm fixing fucking works because it's three ringed and been fixed and three ringed and sort of been fixed for weeks now now it's three ringed right now so I have to heat it up again and I think it's just broken so but I've done so many mods to it that I kind of want it to be fixed because it'll look like a Frankenstein's monster when I'm done this is a long ass final thought

1010
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:57,424
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought Say no to bullshit

1011
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:15,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Really good final thought, appreciate that.

1012
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:30,638
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to close tonight on this, and I hate to end the show on such a downer, but it is very important to acknowledge, and I'm sure if you have an internet connection you've heard about it this week, we have to acknowledge the passing of Gary Gygax, which happened this week.

1013
01:05:30,978 --> 01:05:34,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might not know the name, but you definitely know the legacy he left behind.

1014
01:05:34,942 --> 01:05:37,965
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons and TSR.

1015
01:05:38,485 --> 01:05:43,111
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's face it, without Dungeons & Dragons, you would not have role-playing games like you have today.

1016
01:05:43,191 --> 01:05:47,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, think about all the games that were inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.

1017
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:56,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about everything from old school games like Ultima and the actual Dungeons & Dragons games that were on, you know, the Apple IIe and all that.

1018
01:05:57,339 --> 01:06:01,642
[SPEAKER_06]: and to everything that we have new today, the Final Fantasies of the world, the Warcrafts.

1019
01:06:02,023 --> 01:06:09,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you've actually played D&D, there actually are a lot of similarities between a huge game like World of Warcraft and this.

1020
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So unfortunately, he did pass away this week at the age of 69.

1021
01:06:14,412 --> 01:06:18,575
[SPEAKER_06]: We do want to acknowledge the importance that this man had on the gaming industry.

1022
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:47,602
[SPEAKER_06]: and certainly we not only want to dedicate everything we've done tonight to his memory but we thought we'd close a little bit again kind of breaking form a little bit we thought we'd close tonight with a song because moments of silence are kind of awkward on podcasts so we thought we'd instead play a song and this song is from a game that was definitely you could say directly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons it's the theme to Neverwinter Nights and while we play this song just maybe tip your hat bow your head

1023
01:06:48,228 --> 01:06:52,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Say some final words for Gary Gygax, the creator of Dungeons & Dragons, who passed this week at the age of 69.
