00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, March the 9th of 2008 for this part

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,160
B of our podcast, which we hope we'll actually upload to our feed this week with no problems,

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
unlike last time.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,140
But let me not jinx things, let me shut up and let Loki get back into the gaming news

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,400
this week.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,840
This week, well, of course we knew this was coming, but now, other than Steam, you can

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,720
now buy the, or soon, you will be able to buy the components of the Orange box separately.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,200
You'll be hitting retail stores on April 9th, you'll be able to buy Portal for $19.99, and

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,480
then of course Half-Life 2, Episode 1 and 2 for $29.99 and Team Fortress 2 for $29.99.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,880
All sold separately now, so, awesome.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,720
I don't know, Half-Life 2 I don't think was that expensive to begin with, I mean, might

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,080
as well just buy them all.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,320
I think this is a really good way for people who haven't seen Portal yet to get it, because

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,920
I know people that would consider that $60 for Portal was a decent buy, and you got all

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,700
these other cool games free.

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,000
So honestly, this is an excellent, I mean, not to knock the other games, because the

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,800
Orange box is a great combo package, but certainly there's a lot of people that want to see Portal

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
by itself.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,400
I guess if you've owned, if you already owned like Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, although if

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,680
you buy the episode pack, you're getting one all over again, so, I don't know.

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,240
Oh, go ahead.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,120
That whole bunch of Half-Life is just epic.

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,520
It is very epic.

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,280
I never realized you were quite the Half-Life fan, DarkStalker, but during our bonus segment

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,040
tonight which only the live listeners heard, you're quite a Half-Life fan, I didn't realize.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,480
Well, keep in mind, I can't really play them because I get bad motion sickness when I play

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
them.

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,800
That doesn't mean you don't recognize a good game when you see one.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,720
That's right, and I, you know, I love the story for Half-Life 2, I mean, Half-Life was

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,360
sort of like, oh, you crawl through some pipes and you kill some aliens, but I thought that

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,640
Half-Life 2 had a very, actually a really involved story, I thought it was very good.

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
It is very rad.

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,720
I was basically loading up everything on my iPhone and listening to it on YouTube at my

34
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
desk at work.

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,520
RossdillUT has some advice, and I'm kind of curious if it actually would work or not.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,800
He says play on a smaller screen.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Would that help?

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
No?

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
That's too bad.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
It actually has gotten a little bit better since we started playing on the widescreen.

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
Huh.

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,600
Because I have a 50-inch widescreen TV, and it was a lot worse on our old CRT, which was

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
smaller.

44
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Weird.

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,800
I kind of get the logic behind what he's suggesting, though.

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
It's kind of weird that it's the reverse.

47
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,680
The flatter the screen, the less sick I get.

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Huh.

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,360
And I also get less eye strain on my old Trinitron versus my old CRT screen.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Yeah, the eye strain.

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,720
Or my standard monitor.

52
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Interesting.

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,600
But it still is bad.

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,880
No matter what, it still is bad.

55
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,480
However, nothing makes me as freaking motion sick as GoldenEye64 did.

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,280
All right.

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,440
Well anyhow, moving on.

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,040
Speaking of splitting up, Ziff Davis Media owns a lot of stuff, and after this they might

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,920
have to split some of it off.

60
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,120
No, I'm just kidding.

61
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm not here yelling doom and gloom, but certainly that's what a lot of people are speculating

62
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,800
after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week.

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
That's right.

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,960
Ziff Davis filed for bankruptcy earlier this week.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,280
They had $390 million in debt since last August.

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,000
Now, if this bankruptcy is actually approved by the bankruptcy courts, Ziff Davis is going

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,360
to have to restructure some things.

68
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,780
I don't know if that necessarily means they're going to unload some of their properties.

69
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,680
I don't know how that actually works.

70
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm no legal expert.

71
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
Maybe folks in chat can give us some light on that.

72
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,560
But they're going to have to somehow basically rearrange things to pay off this $400 million.

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,000
However, they are saying that all the video game stuff, it should be business as usual.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,360
Jason Young, who is the CEO of Ziff Davis, has this quote, quote, today's restructuring

75
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,340
agreement goes a long way towards resolving the burdens of a debt load and capital structure

76
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,440
established seven years ago during a leveraged buyout of the company.

77
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
That's Chapter 11, right?

78
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Yeah.

79
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Yeah.

80
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,840
Basically, a Chapter 11 is just strictly for businesses only, because we actually, at my

81
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,960
work, we occasionally get a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in for multi-family homes, basically apartments,

82
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,680
condos, that type of thing.

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,360
And this is basically done for the purpose of paying back and restructuring their debt.

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,960
It's to give the company a chance to make a fresh start.

85
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
All right.

86
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
Well, we'll see what happens.

87
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,800
And of course, people are screaming doom and gloom, and our chat room is no different.

88
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,440
P.K. Jr. 92 says, does this mean OneUp will die?

89
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
No.

90
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Doubt it.

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
I mean, it's one of their more successful properties.

92
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
It's one of their more successful properties, right?

93
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,080
Bankruptcy doesn't really kill something, so.

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,440
Well, the bad thing about Chapter 11 is that it's actually really bad for their stockholders.

95
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Gotcha.

96
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,320
Because if their debts exceed their assets, then when the bankruptcy is done, all of their

97
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,320
rights and interests are terminated.

98
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,400
Basically all the creditors have a new business to start with, nothing on the books.

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,440
S.J. 100 Matt says, if Dave is going bankrupt, could mean the end of digital life.

100
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,640
I don't know about that, because they were a major sponsor, but I don't know.

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,360
We'll see.

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,560
I guess that's too bad, though, for them, I guess.

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,680
But business sucks sometimes, so hopefully this will be a nice, fresh start for them.

104
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,340
That's what you can usually tell if there's rumors going out about a company going under

105
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,840
when people start selling off their stock.

106
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
True.

107
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Anyway.

108
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,680
That's all I got.

109
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,480
Well, how about something that's just a little bit happier, huh?

110
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
Sure.

111
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Midway!

112
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:48,760
We like Midway, except Midway's been losing some money, too, about, well, more around

113
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,560
the amount of $97.4 million last financial year.

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:03,280
So they're trying to cater more towards the casual gamer by having an online portal for

115
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,040
a lot of those games that are out.

116
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,520
I mean, basically, it's just, well, I just completely lost my train of thought.

117
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
That's okay.

118
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,400
Midway owns the rights to a lot of classic franchises, though, right?

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Yeah.

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
I mean, Midway, it was, wasn't Midway that brought us out like Mortal Kombat?

121
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Yeah.

122
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Well, I mean, I'm going even further back than that, because I'm thinking about those

123
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,440
like classic packs with like Robotron and Joust and, you know, all that.

124
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,040
They've re-tashed that stuff a thousand times.

125
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,080
I wonder if this is kind of a part of how they're going to launch a more casual games

126
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
portal.

127
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,760
Or, because, you know, I could think of casual games as old-school games that were very simple,

128
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,560
or I could think of them as, you know, PopCap-type casual games, like Bejeweled and stuff, that,

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,040
again, you know, very easy to pick up and play type games.

130
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,120
I would go in probably with the older games and say, like, re-release that shit over and

131
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,040
over and over and over and over again.

132
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,600
Well, basically, they're only saying that two titles have been out that's used any of

133
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,200
the different type of proprietary technology that they've been working on so far today,

134
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
and that was just Stranglehold and Blacksite.

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,080
Well, you know, it's unfortunate for Midway, but the games they've released recently haven't

136
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,560
been anything to really scream about.

137
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
I mean, I guess there was Unreal.

138
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,920
I mean, don't get me wrong, but some of those other games just didn't really live up to

139
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,320
the hype, unfortunately.

140
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Which is a bummer, because Midway's given us a lot of great games, too, but I think

141
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,400
they just had a rough 07.

142
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,800
So who knows, I heart classic games, though, and if the Portal is built good, where it

143
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,420
does online high scoreboards and maybe some achievement point type thing and some clever

144
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:44,960
new little innovative things that make it stand out, I would probably check it out.

145
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:53,640
So I guess we're coming up on the 10th anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast, and to commemorate

146
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,760
that, Sega of Japan has updated their Dreamcast.com website with a question.

147
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,640
Do you still own a Dreamcast?

148
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,840
Yes.

149
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,560
If you do, what you can do is submit your serial number, and they will basically register

150
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,040
an account with you with user.Dreamcast.com, and you'll get an email, which is your serial

151
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,600
number at Dreamcast.com, Gmail account.

152
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,200
What the hell is that going to do for me?

153
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
I don't know.

154
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Maybe there's some more stuff that they're going to do.

155
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,960
Right now, actually, the website's down, so apparently enough people think that that's

156
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
interesting.

157
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,920
I could register both of mine.

158
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,800
There's hardcore Sega people out there, hard fucking core Sega people out there.

159
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,920
Jamie's kind of borderline one of them, I think.

160
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I have two Dreamcasts.

161
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,760
Maybe I should register mine so I can have another spam email address.

162
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Why not?

163
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
It would be fun.

164
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
That's weird, though.

165
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
You just have your serial number.

166
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,940
I mean, it almost makes me wonder, like, wow, could they release an email program for the

167
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,520
Dreamcast or something really weird all these years later?

168
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,320
But yeah, the Dreamcast came out, what, $9,999, but I imagine it was a little bit before that

169
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
in Japan, right?

170
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
We're bringing it back.

171
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,360
I think that I got my other one in, I want to say, April?

172
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,640
Yeah, it was probably a few months earlier in Japan.

173
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,560
Yeah, because I had my Dreamcast way early.

174
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,920
Yeah, well, why couldn't they?

175
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,680
I mean, that would be kind of cool to bring it back, just make it all open source type

176
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
stuff.

177
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
You know what I mean?

178
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,160
I mean, they already have a pretty big open source community for homebrew stuff, but just

179
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,240
a lot of these portable game systems, even like the DS and stuff, aren't that powerful.

180
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,480
I mean, you could probably do a lot on the Dreamcast that you could do on those systems,

181
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,400
so why not?

182
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,960
Well, we'll see what happens, see what this develops into.

183
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,800
I hope we haven't heard the last of the Dreamcast.

184
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,760
Even if it's something, I mean, obviously we don't expect a lot, but even something

185
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,840
little that would be fun, I think them putting out some type of, like, disk image you could

186
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,480
burn and play on your Dreamcast for, like, a 10th anniversary thing would be the cutest

187
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
thing.

188
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
I mean, it would be fun.

189
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
You know we'd all download it and check it out.

190
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,040
Like, a 10th anniversary Choo-Choo Rocket, come on.

191
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Who wouldn't want to check it out?

192
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
You know, I have a press kit for Choo-Choo Rocket.

193
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Do you really?

194
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,520
Yep, somewhere, still complete.

195
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,920
Wow, what kind of special stuff was in it?

196
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,240
Just like pictures and write-ups and stuff about the game.

197
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,040
It was just in a box, a big Choo-Choo Rocket box.

198
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Well, technology has come a long way since the days of the Dreamcast, you know, now we

199
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,800
have the Xbox 360, which are on live and all that stuff, and once you know it, it didn't

200
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,520
take too long before we have yet another story coming from a CBS news station, WCBS-TV in

201
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:28,680
New York is reporting, and this is the headline, Alarming Trend Online Video Game Predators.

202
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,760
Well, here's what the Predators story is about.

203
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,420
It talks about this boy who's 12 years old.

204
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,580
He loves playing the PlayStation 3 game Burnout Paradise, and he says he plays against strangers

205
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,700
he knows only by their username, and when you cause people to crash, the webcam takes

206
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,240
a snapshot of the player's reaction.

207
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,880
I didn't know it did that on the PlayStation 3, too.

208
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,480
Yeah, with their eye camera.

209
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Interesting.

210
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,520
Well, here's what happened, is that according to the story, apparently things were going

211
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,560
fine and then this guy crashed into somebody and the webcam picture came back, and it was

212
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
a butt.

213
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,760
Somebody put their butt on the webcam, but it actually, I don't know, it gets a little

214
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,660
sick because Najee's father, whose name is Charles Johnson, said that the image showed

215
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,380
a lot more than just a butt.

216
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,360
It was a picture of the guy mooning the camera and you could actually see his genitals.

217
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Gross!

218
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,880
Why would you send that picture over?

219
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,520
That takes talent, too, because the camera takes the picture pretty quick, so you'd have

220
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,000
to crash your car in, like, I don't know, you'd have to...

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Or you'd have to have your friends standing there, waiting to go.

222
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,320
Oh, there you go, yeah.

223
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Never thought about that.

224
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Come on!

225
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
Come on!

226
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,480
It's one thing to do that to your friends and people on your friends list and stuff

227
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,040
and people you know very well, but it's another to do it to strangers, especially, you know,

228
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,480
when you consider that it might be a 12-year-old kid who's playing the game.

229
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,800
And as sensationalist as the story is, it does make some decent points.

230
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,000
The father said that he thought it would be fine to play because the game is rated E for

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,720
everyone, or E10 plus or whatever, however, of course, the ESRB does have that warning.

232
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,000
It's in the beginning of the fucking game, for a second there, and you have to hit a

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,040
button to go past it.

234
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,440
But at the same time, I understand that, but at the same time, come on, what fucking moron

235
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
did this?

236
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,760
I mean, to show your butt to your friends is one thing, but to show it to complete strangers

237
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,980
when it might be 12-year-old kids playing the game is kind of messed up, and causes

238
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,040
things like this to happen, where now the media runs with it and talks about sexual

239
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
predators.

240
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,600
It's because the media- They were probably high, I don't think they're

241
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,600
sexual predators, they're probably drug users, not that that makes it right.

242
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,420
It's because the media has nothing to talk about.

243
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,080
I'll give you a perfect example, we were watching the local news yesterday, and they were talking

244
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,240
about a fire that happened in North Carolina.

245
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
We live in California.

246
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,480
I mean, how fucking slow is the news if you're talking about a building fire in another state?

247
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,720
Oh, and then they perceived this show a, what was it, a chicken sledding, and that's how

248
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,260
slow the news was.

249
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,880
That's why they run with this crap, because they can spin it, and it's an interesting

250
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
story.

251
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,560
It'll put some, not really put asses in seats, but you know what I mean, tunes people in.

252
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Rob with two Bs pours a little salt in the wound, says California has enough of its own

253
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
fires.

254
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Oh.

255
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Not right now they don't.

256
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,880
They're in between fires, C, sir.

257
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,640
Pendro in chat says this, you should be able to rate people as you play them, like feedback

258
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
on eBay or something.

259
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,600
And of course the 360 has a system kind of like that, but what about PS3?

260
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,280
I'm not sure.

261
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,400
I don't know, maybe.

262
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,480
I think there needs to be a way where something can be done a little more immediately.

263
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,280
I mean, I know on Xbox 360, they swear up and down, they do review that stuff, but there's

264
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,480
got to be something a little more instantaneous that can be done.

265
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,600
You know what I mean?

266
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
I don't know.

267
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,840
I don't know if you have to pay people.

268
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,120
My God, dude.

269
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
It's a person's ass.

270
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,840
It's not like you're scarred for fucking life.

271
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,960
Well, I kind of see it.

272
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,960
That is kind of nasty, like if you're a 12 year old kid, because they're saying it's

273
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,680
not just his butt, but I guess the whole naughty bits were dangling there too, so you know.

274
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Okay, okay.

275
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Yeah.

276
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
I'm so sorry.

277
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,760
Yeah, tomorrow they're going to go out and murder people because they've been severely

278
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
scarred.

279
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,400
That's right, you better watch your kids now because now they're going to go on a murderous

280
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,340
rage and go and rape and pillage and fucking, the world is over for you and your family.

281
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,320
Might as well, you know, leave the country.

282
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
That's all.

283
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,640
Rasteel UT says, PlayStation 3 lets you block people, but there's no rating system for people.

284
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,800
He also says you're overreacting.

285
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,520
Dark Soccer, you're awfully quiet.

286
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,440
What are your thoughts on this?

287
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,600
It's a butt and it's, you know, dangly bits, I guess.

288
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,720
So you're saying, you know what?

289
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,880
Maybe we should just stop being so frickin' sensitive to...

290
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,480
I really think, that said, if people didn't make a big deal out of this crap, then it

291
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,640
wouldn't, you know, be such an issue.

292
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
All right.

293
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,600
Well, if you have some feedback, you know I sent us an email, mailbagorangelanatrader.com,

294
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,560
but regardless, you know what?

295
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Thinking about that this guy was so stupid to do this to strangers kind of pisses me

296
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,240
off and makes me a little bit angsty that this guy was such a moron, so it's time to

297
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
have the FUs of the week.

298
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:43,000
I have a few FUs to compile.

299
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,120
My first one goes, of course, to Daylight Savings Time, because I went to bed at 4.30am

300
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,960
and, of course, woke up at 1.30am.

301
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,280
My next one goes towards the guy who was driving the red pickup truck, which, by the way, was

302
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,600
a Ford, and Ford stands for Fix-Off and Repair Daily.

303
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,760
Anyway, I was in the left lane and he was in the right lane, and then he just cut out

304
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,560
in front of me, like, literally with inches to spare to get into the turning lane on the

305
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,680
left side of me, and I was like, dude, where'd you learn how to drive, you know?

306
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,160
Oh, I'm sorry, you did learn how to drive, if you're driving like that.

307
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,720
I hate stupid people who drive.

308
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:31,560
And also, another FU goes to my cat for throwing up in an inappropriate place.

309
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Sorry to hear it.

310
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,440
Although, she's a cute baby and I forgive her.

311
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Logie!

312
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,460
FU to this guy named Michael T-something or I don't remember his last name, but apparently

313
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:49,760
I knew enough because we sat there at dinner on Saturday, no, Friday, I'm sorry, and this

314
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,960
guy went on and on and on and on about his fucking life next to us.

315
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,840
Apparently this couple was on their first date or whatever.

316
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,120
I feel sorry for the woman because this guy just went on and on.

317
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah, one time I had a felony, but they cleared it, so it's all good now, and, you know, I

318
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,160
took in my truck because I'm a, what was it, he was a plumbing inspector, and I took in

319
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,440
my truck one time and they gave me a loaner car and it was an undercover cop car, and

320
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,000
so I drove through the ghetto and everyone was like, oh my god, it's the cops, ah!

321
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,520
Went on and on for two hours and he was still talking the entire time.

322
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't think the woman got a word in, so, sucks for, don't meet people on MySpace, this

323
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,960
is what happens.

324
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:41,320
All right, my FUs of the week go to also Daylight Savings Time, I think it's horrible, and losing

325
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,920
sleep sucks, I hate that, and, gosh, I can't really think of a lot else, I think just Daylight

326
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,960
Savings Time makes up the bulk of my FUs this week.

327
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,600
I think it's unnecessary.

328
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,480
It is a necessary FU, because when you lose sleep, there's never a good thing to come

329
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,040
out of that, so, there you have it, our FUs of the week.

330
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,600
I do want to point this out real quick, Toshin is in our Justin TV chat and says that the

331
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:14,040
whole Dreamcast thing, says it's a scam, and gives me a link to the Neo GAF forums that

332
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,440
isn't loading for me right now, I'm timing out, so I can't read you the full text of

333
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,120
what it says, but apparently, that Dreamcast thing may not be legitimate.

334
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,120
Eh, who cares, I don't really care.

335
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,520
It's a fucking Dreamcast, what are they going to do with my serial number?

336
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,680
I guess that's true, what can they do with the serial number?

337
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,000
Besides maybe send spam, do you have to give me your email address?

338
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,800
I don't know, I haven't signed up, the site's down, so...

339
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,520
Well, maybe it got taken down for being a big scam!

340
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,160
No, there's an error thing, I think it's just too many people are trying to access it at

341
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
one time.

342
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Alright.

343
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,320
Well, let's go ahead and get back into some gaming news.

344
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,640
Oh, actually, no, we're going to go and actually check out the mailbag.

345
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,720
Maybe I should pay attention to the schedule once in a while.

346
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Maybe so.

347
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Maybe I should.

348
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Did we get a lot of emails this week?

349
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,440
I didn't see a lot in there earlier.

350
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
You know why?

351
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,360
Because Part B got screwed up, and that's where we had the mailbag last time, so I feel

352
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,280
very sorry for all those people who...

353
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,080
Oh, shoot, I moved all those emails out.

354
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
That's alright.

355
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
No, that's alright.

356
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Just because I read them.

357
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,520
Yeah, because you read them last week, and technically they were on the show, they just

358
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,120
weren't on the podcast, which kind of sucks for those people, so we're very sorry.

359
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,920
You'll have to email us again, or look for The Lost Show or something, I don't know.

360
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,560
But regardless, we are going to open up the mailbag, because we did get at least a couple

361
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
emails, right?

362
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
A couple.

363
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,560
And that's enough for us to open up the mailbag and jump on in, so fill up the mailbag.

364
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,520
Give Jamie a lot of work to do next week.

365
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Mailbag at orangelandarita.com.

366
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Here we go.

367
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
My tongue.

368
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:53,000
The first email of the week is actually from Cheeseburger asking us to play the intro to

369
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,040
Castlevania 64.

370
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,680
Make me play the intro from a good game and we'll do it.

371
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,960
Uh, well, he actually emailed us, actually, no, I take that back, that wasn't from Cheeseburger,

372
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,960
it was from, god, now I have to go in that folder to find out who it was, because he

373
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,280
emailed us something else, but I can't read half of it on the air, because it involves

374
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,960
finding a broken DS and using their serial number to replace it, and we're not going

375
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
to do that.

376
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,360
We're not going to do that, I'm sorry.

377
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,680
Not after the debates we've been in the past couple weeks, I think maybe that email is

378
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
best unread.

379
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,880
But also, he's saying something about, do Koopa and Purin exist in Super Smash Bros.

380
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Melee?

381
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,600
I think he means Brawl, basically, he was saying that if you change the language, Bowser

382
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,480
becomes Koopa and Jigglypuff becomes Purin, which were their original names, and then

383
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,360
you can save them that way?

384
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,860
I don't know what you mean, so, sorry, that's the only other email.

385
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:06,040
And by the way, that one that I lost was from somebody named Jake.

386
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,440
You lost an email?

387
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,960
No, it's, he didn't put a signature on there, the one that I mistakenly gave to Cheeseburger.

388
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Oh.

389
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
So.

390
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
That's it?

391
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,440
We didn't get any, like, real email.

392
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Weak.

393
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,320
Except some spam that I'm deleting right now that's titled LOL.

394
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,080
And Rob did it!

395
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
What's that?

396
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
It's titled LOL and you laughed.

397
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
LOL.

398
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
I did.

399
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
LOL.

400
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Loss.

401
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Weak mailbag.

402
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,800
I'm disappointed in all of you, but then again, I blame not having a Part B last week where

403
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,880
we actually had a mailbag to remind you that you can send us emails, so send us emails.

404
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,520
Are you a hardcore gamer?

405
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
Yes.

406
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Have you downloaded the hardcore gamer pack yet?

407
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
No!

408
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,880
Well then you're not really a hardcore gamer.

409
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,160
Oh my god, how dare you!

410
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Exactly.

411
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,520
On Xbox Live Marketplace, there is a brand new hardcore gamer picture pack, featuring

412
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:11,360
such wonderful pictures as Proud to be a Noob, Camper, Respawn, a little target symbol, and

413
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
T-Bag.

414
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Yes, T-Bag.

415
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Why?

416
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,960
If you really want to buy this, it's only $1.25 and yes, all people will know that you're

417
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,240
truly hardcore if you buy this and display them proudly.

418
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,720
Or I would like to point out that for free, you can download Community Gamer Picks, and

419
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,800
we're in pack number two of the Community Gamer Picks, and there's a little pick that

420
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,760
says OLR, and if you put that on your gamertag, at least we'll know you're hardcore, as will

421
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,320
all the rest of the OLR me.

422
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,960
So don't download this crap.

423
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Don't pay for this.

424
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Yeah, these look really stupid.

425
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,620
SSG100Matt sums up my thoughts exactly.

426
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,440
Why do they need to endorse stupidity that is T-Bagging?

427
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,720
I don't know, maybe we should ask disruptive media publishers.

428
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I think we should!

429
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,480
Do we have a telephone number?

430
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,400
Let's call them right now, I'm sure they're there.

431
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,200
I don't know, let me get on that.

432
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,840
We'll send them an email maybe this week, we'll see.

433
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,440
Are you going to download the Hardcore Gamer Picks, Loki?

434
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,480
No, I'm doing it right now.

435
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Oh wow.

436
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Well, what's pretty hardcore as well is proposing to your significant other over a video game,

437
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,880
but do you know what's really hardcore?

438
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,400
I remember last year we had this story, I think we had a Viva Pinata story, we had an

439
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,440
Animal Crossing story, I want to say, and this time, this is kind of interesting, he

440
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:42,400
actually made a homebrew version of his significant other's favorite game, which was Bejeweled.

441
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,640
He made a homebrew version of this on the DS, and this guy Bernie, he's actually a user

442
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,800
on Zanga, what he did, he spent a few weeks actually making this Nintendo DS version of

443
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,680
Bejeweled completely from the ground up, and what happens is that once the game gets to

444
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,360
a certain score, the screen clears, and then what would happen is that a ring of the jewels

445
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,600
comes up on the screen, and what he did is that when his girlfriend was playing the game

446
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:13,580
and then got on the special screen, Bernie actually had a real ring there and proposed.

447
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,640
Everybody, awww.

448
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,740
Sorry, hairball.

449
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:28,900
But no, that is definitely dedication to build a game to propose to your significant other

450
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,900
with.

451
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,340
hardcore. So, good for you.

452
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,420
That is pretty cool.

453
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,220
I was just going to say, if you would like to email Disruptive Media Publishers and tell

454
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:46,220
them how crappy those hardcore gamer pics are, you can email them at info at disruptivepublishers.com.

455
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:55,820
Also have a mailing address on disruptivepublishers.com, so check it out. They're in Bellingham, Washington.

456
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,060
Ossifer in chat suggests, teabag your girlfriend for instant marriage.

457
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,860
They also have a Facebook community, too.

458
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,740
Let her know you're hardcore.

459
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,460
Because all the cool kids are on Facebook, man.

460
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:15,460
Teabagger. Right, DarkSakura? If Dan teabagged you in Halo, that's love, right?

461
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,700
My silence is my answer.

462
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,660
I'm getting blinked at. Perhaps we should move on, then.

463
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:28,660
Well, for anyone who's a fan of Undertow, there is an expansion out, but it costs. However,

464
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:35,500
it is only 200 Microsoft points, as opposed to 400, so if this is a boo-boo, go ahead

465
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,420
and get it, if you care.

466
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,660
Except I should point out the boo-boo has now been fixed. It's still 400 points now.

467
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,240
Aw, poor babies.

468
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:52,140
At any rate, though, there is some information on an expansion, Path of the Elect. It's five

469
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:58,460
levels, you have a new alien race called the Elect, wow, and four multiplayer maps, so

470
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,460
there's no other details than that. And, yeah, it's been fixed.

471
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,540
Huh. Well, it was free for, I mean, the game was free for a while, you know, to make up

472
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,780
for Xbox Live outages, although I'm not sure if that's really more of a punishment for

473
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,420
us or for, you know, thank you, I don't really...

474
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:21,580
I can't say I was an Undertow fan, but, you know, it's hard to bitch when something's

475
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:27,140
free. It's really hard to complain. Then again, I think about Totem Ball and Yaris, and there's

476
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:33,820
been some real shit free games on Xbox Live, but then, like, Age's Wing wasn't bad. It

477
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,060
wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. It was no Yaris, come on.

478
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:45,460
Yeah, so, I don't know. Yaris is unforgivable. I will never buy a Yaris because of that.

479
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,860
And, yeah, they suck.

480
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:56,180
So, there is a rumor that there's going to be a price cut coming for European Xbox 360s,

481
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,700
and apparently the price cut is supposed to happen on March 14th. It's going to be a price

482
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,940
cut of 50 Euros, and I guess we'll see if this actually happens. It's being reported

483
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:15,620
by TechRadar, and apparently they got the news of a new SKU. So, numerous well-placed

484
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:21,340
game industry sources, they said, have confirmed it. And that would bring a price, I guess,

485
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:31,420
of the 360 to 250 Euros for the arcade pack, and around 100 and... I'm sorry, 250 Euros

486
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:40,060
for the 360, and then the arcade would be 197 Euros. So, I don't know. Hopefully that

487
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,740
happens, but I guess we'll find out soon if that's the case.

488
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,940
Well, price cuts aren't a bad thing. I mean, I cannot think of a story where we've talked

489
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,820
about a price cut and it was a bad thing. So...

490
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
I'm thinking.

491
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,740
I know Loki, the devil's advocate here on the program, trying to think of something.

492
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,180
I'm sure there's the chat as well. Well, you think about that while I report on this. Other

493
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:10,100
worldly news, Asia is finally going to be getting Guitar Hero. And what's kind of interesting,

494
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,060
Blizzard is actually going to be helping the game actually come to Asia, because you know

495
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:18,020
how Activision just recently combined with Blizzard? Well, Blizzard has the institutional

496
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:24,300
expertise to bring Guitar Hero to places like China and Korea. And if you kind of think

497
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,380
about it, Blizzard did launch World of Warcraft.

498
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,300
I know how they're doing it.

499
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,460
They're going to have it where if you play the game well enough, you gain experience

500
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,540
in World of Warcraft on your account.

501
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:41,060
Who knows? Who knows? Apparently, the Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has also said this. He's

502
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:46,300
brought up the possibility of maybe putting other instruments in Guitar Hero, which would

503
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,180
be no surprise if you remember our story on DJ Hero's trademark last week.

504
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,700
I've got a totally great idea. This has never been attempted ever before. We're going to

505
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:58,280
put singing and drums in the game. And guess what? We also may put keyboards. Never been

506
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,580
done before on the face of the Earth. We are the first.

507
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,420
And then we're going to have a turntable and five to seven keys.

508
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,260
They need a Zither Hero.

509
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
I still want Satara Hero.

510
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,340
Where are our awards for originality and innovation?

511
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,060
Give me DigiRedo Hero. That's original.

512
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:21,740
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

513
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,820
DigiRedo Hero would rock. And you know it.

514
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:30,500
Anyway, Clarinet Hero.

515
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:36,180
To continue on, though, with Guitar Hero information, for Guitar Hero 3, in time for St. Patrick's

516
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:43,500
Day, there is going to be a pack with stuff by Dropkick Murphys, which is pretty cool.

517
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,580
There will be Famous for Nothing, Flanagan's Ball, and Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya. So that's

518
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,860
pretty cool.

519
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,020
And also right now there's a modern metal pack out, though, that has some cool stuff

520
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,700
on it, too.

521
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,460
How very holiday appropriate.

522
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,460
That's an interesting...

523
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,780
I like Dropkick Murphys, but I like Flogging Molly better. And I would have gone with them.

524
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,900
So I was on YouTube looking for DigiRedo clips so I could, you know, hypothesize what DigiRedo

525
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:20,180
Hero might sound like. Keep in mind I've never heard this, but this says DigiRedo Techno.

526
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,180
This could be horrible.

527
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,180
It's pretty sweet, actually.

528
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
That's actually pretty fucking rad.

529
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,180
That is really cool.

530
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Oh my god, this Aboriginal guy on the streets, this is live. He actually has a little techno

531
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,180
thing and he's playing the didgeridoo to this.

532
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,180
I'd buy that.

533
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:53,020
I would buy that in a heartbeat.

534
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,740
It's fucking sweet.

535
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,740
So hardcore.

536
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
That's awesome.

537
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,740
I like that song.

538
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,580
I am going to link that YouTube. Search for it. It's Didgeridoo Techno on YouTube.

539
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,580
That's pretty sweet.

540
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:10,140
If you know how to spell didgeridoo. D-I-D-G-E-R-I-D-O-O. I'm going to put that in my favorites on YouTube.

541
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,980
I think that was pretty rad. I'll actually put that in the OLR favorites right now. Check

542
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,020
that out. That's pretty awesome.

543
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:25,060
All right, sorry, we can go back to real gaming news now. I'll stop the didgeridoo.

544
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,540
I'm telling you, man, this guy needs to put out a fucking album.

545
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,540
Seriously.

546
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
That's sweet.

547
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,300
Look, we need to get him on the show. I want a new, I mean, with all due respect to Midi

548
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,900
Head and the great OLR theme he made us, he's an awesome guy. I do think it's time to maybe

549
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,700
get a fresh Orange Lounge Radio theme in here and I demand Didgeridoo in the theme.

550
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,540
And Auto Harp.

551
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
Somebody needs to make that happen.

552
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,980
That is fucking awesome.

553
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:58,180
All right. Orange Lounge Radio, wah, wah, wah, sky, dark, soccer, Loki, wah, wah, wah.

554
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,260
Anyway, sorry.

555
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,260
So, Loki, SingStar.

556
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,940
Sorry, I was so distracted by Didgeridoo stuff.

557
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,740
I know. It has that effect on people.

558
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,540
Even though we still haven't gotten it over here yet, there is a second PS3 SingStar on

559
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,540
the way. But, wait, why is there a second SingStar on the way? Because I thought there

560
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,380
was a whole SingStar with tons of songs that you can download from other SingStar games

561
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
already.

562
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,380
Well, apparently it's just going to be some new content, hopefully, but apparently Aussie

563
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,940
Retail Systems have noticed a new SKU for SingStar Volume 2, which is apparently due

564
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,740
in June. So, Australia may see another SingStar game, although we over here in the United

565
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,140
States are still waiting for the first SingStar game.

566
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,420
We actually have a clip of one of the new songs from SingStar.

567
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:59,980
Okay, I promise that's the last time.

568
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:05,940
The ESRB is taking a little heat this week because one of the ex-employees has come out

569
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,340
and really slammed the ESRB. The guy's name, Jerry Bonner, that's pretty brave to put

570
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,980
your name out there, by the way, when you do this kind of stuff.

571
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,780
He actually was working as a full-time rater person for the ESRB. He worked for six months,

572
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,580
and now he's come out as being critical of the way that the ESRB is doing its job. And

573
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,620
he actually came out and said these are some factors that need changing. He's complaining

574
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,980
that the ESRB needs to actually play the games at rates. Oh, snap, because you know, have

575
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,780
you heard that? That the ESRB actually, the publishers send information to the ESRB, they

576
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,940
don't always play the games. It's kind of, I swear that's how it works. It's very interesting.

577
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,660
I know they can't play it all the way through. Usually they get a clip or a video of like

578
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,380
gameplay footage that's, you know, supposed to be the most violent or, you know, obscene

579
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,600
stuff in the game. And then they make their ratings based on that.

580
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,780
Which is why, you know, things like Hot Coffee were so controversial, because that was omitted.

581
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,140
But I mean, we're not going to go over that whole thing again. But anyhow, here's the

582
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:08,320
other big thing. The guy also says that sequels are not judged on their own merits, but rather

583
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,100
the merits of the games before it.

584
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,460
Okay, that's stupid.

585
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,460
That is crazy. Here's some of the bullet points from what this guy suggests should be changed.

586
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:23,980
Drop the AO rating and add a new rating that's called T16, presumably for 16 years and up.

587
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,780
Play through the games all the way. Stop rating sequels according to the content and their

588
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:37,220
predecessors and be more open and don't be so secretive. And if it's true, that's going

589
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,980
to be a huge kick in the face, if like a lot of this is true.

590
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,100
Well, they've already come out and said, oh, well, blah, blah, blah. You know, we don't

591
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,820
support his views and all that stuff. And we're the ESRB. We're awesome. You know, that

592
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
kind of thing.

593
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,180
Those sound like fair requests to me, though. I don't know if it's just me, but it sounds

594
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,660
very fair to me. What do you think about those revelations, Dark Sakura? I mean, is this

595
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,660
going to...

596
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Not at all surprised?

597
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:04,780
Yeah, but I mean, you know, we kind of rely on the ESRB as gamers when we kind of, you

598
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,380
know, when these games come out and all these horrible things happen. Like, take the butt

599
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,380
story from Burnout earlier. We go, well, the ESRB did say the rating is subject to change.

600
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,500
But if the ESRB gets discredited with stuff like this, this really screws us in a way.

601
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,580
I don't know. It's kind of sad.

602
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,780
It's a... I honestly think it's a sort of a corrupt institution anyway.

603
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,260
Ross Steele UT has said that Patricia Vance has already come out and denied it. Well,

604
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,460
that seems like a given, though. So, I mean, it is kind of a qua... You know, obviously

605
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,380
take it as a rumor for now, but it certainly is a question. I have heard from, you know,

606
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,720
inside folks, and I'm pretty sure it's out there on the internet also, that ESRB doesn't

607
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,300
necessarily play through the games. They will rate based on stuff that you send them. So,

608
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,460
kind of interesting. And I remember overhearing at a trade show once about people, and I think

609
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,940
you were there too, Loki. I don't know if you ever heard this same conversation, but

610
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:02,080
about how a particular game I'm thinking of, a particular game with... I don't even want

611
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,460
to say, because I don't want people to speculate, but a particular game, I heard the two developers

612
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,960
kind of... The developer joking with another really big industry press person about how

613
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,300
they got this through the ESRB with a particular rating. I just was kind of shocked to hear

614
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,300
that kind of talk. So, interesting. Anyhow.

615
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:28,700
Well, there... You know, just to move away from the ESRB and how crappy they are.

616
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Let's.

617
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,820
Yes. Skype is actually coming out on Japanese PSPs this month.

618
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,820
Woohoo!

619
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:43,260
So, it will be on March 18th, and it's only, of course, for the slim PSP, the newer one,

620
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:50,700
and it's supposed to be a month later over here in the US. Also, the microphone attachment

621
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,700
is going to be 2,500 yen, or two for 4,000.

622
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Hmm.

623
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,420
So, that's not bad.

624
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
Not bad at all.

625
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:04,500
I'm glad that Japanese PSP users will get to use this. Good call.

626
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,580
And then we'll be able to do it a month later.

627
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,020
We already have it. We got our first call last week on the Skype line from a Skype PSP

628
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
user.

629
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
Huh.

630
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:20,980
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is going to be due out here next month, and they have released

631
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:27,940
the full list of cars and tracks that are going to be included in that. Tons of different

632
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:38,180
stuff you can pick from, I believe, was it, I want to say like 65 cars and 6 tracks, including

633
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:47,120
the Suzuka Circuit, the Eiger Nordwand, Fuji Speedway, London City Track, Daytona International

634
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,420
Speedway, and the High Speed Ring, and a bunch of different cars. I don't even know what

635
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,920
to even cover on that, but lots of stuff to keep you satisfied until the full game comes

636
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
out.

637
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,980
Also, it's going to have a brand new drift mode for the US version, as well as the ability

638
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,980
to fine tune your car, and two player split screen racing, and I guess a new set of events.

639
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,660
Not bad for 40 bucks.

640
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,860
So that's not just Prologue, that's the full game, right?

641
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,860
No, that's Prologue.

642
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,340
Oh, that's just Prologue.

643
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,340
Yeah.

644
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,500
Okay. What was I going to say? Seems a little weak for the full game. Alright. That's cool.

645
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:33,820
Well, if racing isn't your thing, maybe cheering is. Yay! There is a new cheering game coming

646
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,340
out for the Wii and the DS. It's called All Star Cheer Squad, and it's coming to you from

647
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:44,100
THQ. It's going to be again for the Wii and the DS, and if you're on the Wii, get this,

648
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,200
you get to use the balance board. So you won't just be cheering with your, you can cheer

649
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,300
with your feet and everything. Won't this be fun?

650
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,820
And here's the thing, the game is actually, just to give it authenticity, it's choreographed

651
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:05,660
by Tony Gee, who also choreographed the movie Bring It On. So that actually, you know, I

652
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:13,020
have to admit, it actually sounds kind of fun. Doesn't the All Star Cheer Squad sound

653
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,420
just slightly fun, Dark Sakura?

654
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,420
Slightly.

655
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
Like to play once?

656
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,540
It sounds as much fun as going to the dentist. Although my dentist is pretty cool.

657
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,340
Do you know how much money I would pay for a YouTube of Loki playing All Star Cheer Squad?

658
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,260
There's no money in the world.

659
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:35,580
Maybe that'll be the next bet. Whenever we find another bet for Loki to take on, we'll

660
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:42,340
get him to play All Star Cheer Squad in the Tingle outfit.

661
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,100
We need to make this happen somehow. We will be opening the Skype line after this next

662
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:53,740
story. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Go ahead and give

663
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,020
us a call after this story.

664
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:05,220
Well, for people who were fans of the Castlevania series and collect action figures, it doesn't

665
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:14,060
look like we're going to really be getting the new figures that they were discussing.

666
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:21,300
I mean, basically, they were asked if there were going to be any more in that Castlevania

667
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:28,460
line and it was reported that there were no plans at all and no news on Castlevania figures

668
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,980
and that they will not be revisiting the license.

669
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,380
Well that's kind of a bummer.

670
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,340
I want a Richter figure, dang it.

671
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
Richter.

672
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:42,900
If you're going to say it, you have to say it right.

673
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:49,020
Skype line is open. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. While we're

674
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,620
waiting for some calls, how about some last minute stories? Do you have anything for us

675
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
tonight, Loki?

676
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:57,620
Actually, I don't.

677
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,180
What? We've actually covered everything?

678
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,540
Well, I mean, I'm sure there's some other stuff.

679
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,180
Well, thank God a call's coming in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

680
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:14,020
Hi, this is Ross Steel UT. Let me turn the speakers down. Sorry about that.

681
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,460
No, that's all right. What's on your mind, Ross Steel UT?

682
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:24,020
Not much. I want to talk about the whole thing with the guy whose 360 got wiped clean.

683
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,660
Yeah, and then Bungie actually had to fix it and all that stuff. What's your thoughts

684
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
on that?

685
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,900
Well, much love to Bungie, but where the fuck is Microsoft? They said they were going to

686
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,500
help the guy, and then we haven't heard from them since.

687
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,500
But isn't Bungie like it? No, because they split. I keep wanting to say, oh, but Bungie

688
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
is a person.

689
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,580
Well, they split, but it still wasn't Bungie's fault. That's the thing. This isn't some sort

690
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:56,180
of little casual accident, because from what I understand, the console was marked as permanent

691
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:03,620
marker. Whoever did this had to really get in there, you know what I mean?

692
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:09,460
I always thought that they just gave the console a different shell, but I guess it was actually

693
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,460
real.

694
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:21,580
Actually, if you go to Hard and McBloggy, let me put a link. They show a picture of the

695
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:28,700
console in question, and you'll still see a few little smudge marks. So that is the

696
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,860
console. They just got to work cleaning it off.

697
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
That is so weird.

698
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,820
I think they all go through some sort of power wash.

699
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,580
Like a high pressure wash.

700
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,500
Oh, to make your Xbox look new again?

701
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Yeah.

702
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Basically, yeah.

703
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,700
That's interesting. I wonder if... Oh, my gosh. Oh, yeah, and you can see. Oh, thanks

704
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,700
for the link to the blog. That's interesting. You can totally see how some of the ink is

705
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:01,860
just rubbed off. So that's how you might put your ring or something. I'm thinking last

706
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,860
weekend I watched my friend get her engagement ring washed, and they have a machine that

707
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,980
does it, make it look new again. It's kind of that type of thing. Make your Xbox 360

708
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,980
look new again.

709
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,980
That's weird.

710
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:18,300
Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm not surprised by Microsoft having incompetent

711
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:26,860
tech support. I had my 360 sent in early November, and I got a refurb, and it took me four

712
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:32,740
months to finally get my XBLA games revalidated to the console. Needless to say, I'm never

713
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,300
buying anything off the marketplace again.

714
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,520
That is a big mess. When I sent my Xbox 360 back, thankfully, I only had two arcade games

715
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,160
purchased at the time, and they're not ones I play super... Well, I take that back. Joust

716
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,980
was one. I haven't played that in a while, but Geometry Wars was the other. Thankfully,

717
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,860
I haven't had much issues, because since it is tied to your Xbox Live name, it recognizes

718
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:56,220
me and all that stuff, and it lets me play the full version, but I do have to wait a

719
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,500
couple seconds. Obviously, I'm not going to get frustrated over a couple seconds, but

720
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,300
I'm just thinking I've heard of other people who've lost a lot more than two arcade games,

721
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,300
and it's just a pain in the ass.

722
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:14,700
Well, the problem with XBLA is that you cannot play your stuff offline if you do a refurb.

723
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,740
You have to be online at all times. A couple of days ago, my internet was on the first

724
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,780
time I couldn't do that, so there goes Geometry Wars, there goes Symphony of the Night, Contra,

725
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,780
a few others.

726
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,940
Is this true? Darktitsuya points out that this isn't just a Microsoft thing. He says

727
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,460
in chat, it's the same with Virtual Console. When I got my Wii back, I had to redownload

728
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,460
them, but they didn't cost extra. They were free to replace. Well, that's not so bad.

729
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,580
At least it worked, then.

730
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,140
Well, yeah. At least you can use them without being online. That's the important thing.

731
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,140
I guess that's true.

732
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:49,540
I mean, if I got to download it again, sure, whatever. But this just struck me as an especially

733
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:54,380
evil thing to do to somebody, because there's no reason to do that, especially as the guy

734
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,940
said, hey, I don't want my thing cleaned.

735
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:04,440
I would understand. If Microsoft did this whole power wash thing, I could understand

736
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,480
how they might miss the special request and just everything goes on the assembly line.

737
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,920
They don't pay really any attention to it. It's fix, line, fix. But I think Microsoft

738
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,580
should at least come out and let us know publicly that that's what happened, like I do.

739
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:21,420
Because Microsoft is so out there in the community. They worked really hard. They have, what,

740
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,540
Gamerscore Blog, Major Nelson, and all these people. I'm sure these people are aware of

741
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,540
this negative story being out there on the blog. So I really think Microsoft will say

742
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,620
something about it eventually and kind of admit, oops, my bad.

743
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:40,340
The problem is that Microsoft, for everything they do in the community, there's a million

744
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:46,180
horror stories. There's the alarming amount of red rings. There's the nightmare with getting

745
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,740
your stuff validated on your console so you can use it offline again. And then there's

746
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:57,440
this. It really makes you wonder if the left hand even knows what the right hand is doing.

747
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,660
What do you want to bet, though? I mean, all that aside, what do you want to bet, though,

748
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,660
the reason why Bungie did this for this guy is that somebody at Microsoft saw this story

749
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,300
on the blogs, their community outreach people, and made a phone call.

750
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,540
Oh, I'm sure they were like, yeah, could you help us out here?

751
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:17,100
Yeah, exactly. We fucked up. Can you save our ass? It happens. It happens.

752
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:27,860
Anyway, on better Microsoft news, the Financial Times is reporting that Microsoft might be

753
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,300
considering more Blu-ray support. Some people have even speculated a Blu-ray draw for the

754
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,300
360.

755
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,980
I have heard about that, that Microsoft is supposedly in talks with Sony about the whole

756
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,900
Blu-ray add-on, which is a very strange kind of marriage, but I guess one step that Microsoft

757
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,900
might have to make at this point.

758
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,060
Well, might have to make. They do have to make.

759
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,060
Well, do they?

760
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:54,100
You have to understand the majority of people on a console at the end aren't going to be

761
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,540
online, so you're going to have to have the sort of offline option.

762
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,020
How come the Wii doesn't have to do it?

763
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:07,940
Because the Wii is not being marketed as a media center. We've had this conversation

764
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:14,900
before. It's being marketed on, oh, look at the cute little novelty controller.

765
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:22,220
As you start adding in the forecast channel, the news channel, the TV Guide channel, all

766
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:27,680
this other stuff, it's a different type of center of sorts.

767
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:36,420
I don't know. I just don't see the marketing in the sort of multimedia center of the home

768
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,140
thing.

769
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:44,020
I agree with Frisbee. I don't need it to be, but it's also Microsoft.

770
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:50,140
The only thing that might stop this is that Microsoft doesn't want to be seen as admitting

771
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:56,500
picking a losing side, that they pretty much had to give away those HD DVD add-ons, which

772
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,500
I thought was funny.

773
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,580
You know what? I've got to wrap up so we can get some other calls, but here's the thing.

774
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,220
I would kind of close on this. I would bet that Microsoft doesn't end up doing it, and

775
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,820
they'll just build it into their next system.

776
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:14,540
That's my guess. I mean, I would imagine both the 720 and the PS4 would be Blu-ray.

777
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:18,940
Right. Well, we're probably years off from both, but I think you're right. I think if

778
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,460
they do talk to them about Blu-ray, I think it'll wait until the next Xbox system.

779
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:28,140
We've got to let you go, Rasteel, because we've got to get some other calls, but thanks

780
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,820
so much for your call. Have a good one.

781
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,820
All right. Have a good one.

782
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,820
Take care, buddy.

783
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,820
Bye.

784
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:38,740
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. That

785
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,940
call was seven minutes. I tried to limit him to about four.

786
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,820
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

787
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,860
Yo, it's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest. How you doing?

788
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,380
Xenocore from Ultimate Quest. How are things doing on the Ultimate Quest, Xenocore?

789
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:54,940
Well, we've been sort of hectic considering we've been on and off on our weekends, mainly

790
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:00,500
because I went to Megacon this last weekend up in Orlando. Yeah, doing a little bit of

791
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,940
coverage here and there. My first one, actually, had just popped my contrary on Megacon.

792
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:10,500
Check that out. What's the website again for folks who want to check out that?

793
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,100
Well, for the convention or for our show?

794
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,100
For the show.

795
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:19,980
Oh, well, the show is at UltimateQuest.net. You may hear about something on it last week

796
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,400
since I missed a recording. I didn't get back till late this evening. But, yeah, man, Megacon

797
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,140
was something else, my goodness.

798
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,740
Is that what you called in to talk about tonight was Megacon? What's up?

799
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,180
Well, yeah, I mean, on top of that, they had the first Smash Brothers tournament I happened

800
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:40,820
to catch, which is kind of interesting. But, yeah, the cosplayers, man, I wasn't ready

801
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,700
for that level of dedication at all.

802
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,660
Dude, there's some cosplayers that are so good at what they do. It is astounding. That's

803
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,060
love right there. What were some of the cool cosplays you saw, Xenocore?

804
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:57,140
Well, I got to mention this one that stood out for everything. A 14-year-old girl doing

805
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:03,460
the Mighty Edward from Cowboy Bebop in character all three days. Laptop on her head the entire

806
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,460
time.

807
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,460
Wow.

808
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,460
It was impressive. Yeah.

809
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,580
I thought I was cool when I went as a black mage, even though I borrowed the costume from

810
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,580
Rama.

811
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,620
I got a question for you about role-playing games.

812
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,620
Already?

813
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,740
Have you played Lost Odyssey?

814
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:24,940
We on our show did not. Henderson, man, actually spoke up for the show to review that one.

815
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,660
I haven't grabbed it yet.

816
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,740
I'm just kind of curious, because I know you guys kind of specialize in the role-playing

817
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:34,260
games. I'm kind of curious, and maybe I'll have to wait until you guys take a few trips.

818
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,980
I'm kind of curious of your general thoughts on the game, because the critics overall kind

819
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:43,980
of dogged it a little bit, but I'm in love with it. I think it's a fantastic game.

820
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,940
The main thing that caught my attention is something Henderson mentioned. You can't outlevel

821
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:53,900
the bosses in Lost Odyssey. The bosses level according to what level you are, so the bosses

822
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,900
are always different.

823
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,260
Not really. No wonder there's such pains in the ass.

824
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,940
Not really. They don't level, as far as I'm aware.

825
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,940
They don't level?

826
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:05,500
No, because there's actually some guides out there, the Prima guides and stuff, that tell

827
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,500
you what level you should be at to play the boss. If you would have to grind a little

828
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,860
bit, you can't just go from one boss to the next.

829
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:16,660
Is it maybe because even though the bosses level up, you get more skills, so it makes

830
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:21,500
it easier regardless? That could be my thought, is that maybe, yeah, the bosses are leveling

831
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:26,180
up, but since you get more skills, you get power on them that way, if that makes sense.

832
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:30,580
Because a large part of the game is skills.

833
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,660
Everything I've gotten so far is based on Henderson Man's review.

834
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:39,140
I will be playing it myself sooner or later as soon as the budget allows for it, but until

835
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,460
then I can only go by word of mouth, pretty much.

836
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,540
Well, I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Xenocore. I just had to ask, because it's

837
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:49,900
been a large part of my gaming time lately. What else did you call in to talk about it?

838
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,900
Anything else?

839
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,600
Well, mainly it was just that, that I happened to come across my first con and decided to

840
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,620
share it with some fellow con lovers.

841
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,260
It's been a while since I've been to a con, but definitely we have Fandame coming up in

842
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,100
May or June, right? When's Fandame? Is it Memorial Day weekend, Fandame?

843
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,100
I think it is.

844
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,780
Yeah, but I'm probably not going this year.

845
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:16,220
Oh, is it the same time as your road trip? Oh. Oh. So, oh, well that's a bummer, because

846
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,660
we always do our show there. But, let's see, well there's other cons coming up, and I still

847
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,940
want to go to that one in Chicago, ASIN, is that it?

848
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,660
I really want to go to ASIN.

849
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,060
We'll see, we'll see.

850
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,220
And I have information on that too, later.

851
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,940
Okay. Later then. Later it is.

852
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,860
Xenocore, anything else before I let you go?

853
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:40,740
Just pretty much that, that and the largest Yuri Yowie argument I've ever heard in my

854
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,740
entire life.

855
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,740
No, jeez.

856
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,480
Other than that, that was fine.

857
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,180
Some things you can never escape, but cons.

858
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,820
All right, let's go to YowieCon, the whole thing is an argument.

859
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,260
All right, well Xenocore, thanks so much for your call, and have a good one, and good luck

860
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,260
with your own show, all right?

861
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,820
All right, take it easy, guys.

862
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,720
You too, bye-bye.

863
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,500
What exactly is the Yuri Yowie argument?

864
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,620
Well, hold on, I'm going to ask our next caller.

865
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,300
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio, who's this?

866
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,300
Hey, I'm the family jam sessions, what's up?

867
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,300
I don't care who it is.

868
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:13,420
I want to ask you, DJ Rom S, I want to ask you, what is the Yuri Yowie argument?

869
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:18,580
Oh, man.

870
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,660
What exactly is the Yuri Yowie argument?

871
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,680
You got these fangirls who argue about what's better, Yuri or Yowie.

872
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,340
They run around with these paddles, they will start smacking you with them if you do not

873
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,460
agree with them.

874
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:39,500
This is true, that's why I said going to YowieCon is like a whole argument in and of itself.

875
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:45,260
My friend, my other friend Jasmine, she has this priestess outfit, she walks around with

876
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:50,540
an anti-Yowie paper fan that she smacks people with.

877
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:55,300
That is nothing short of amazing, I don't know how else to describe it, but they yell

878
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,100
at each other, this sounds like stupid fun, but they actually get upset over this.

879
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:04,700
They really do think they're going to beat it into you to like Yowie.

880
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,900
Some of them do, I mean a couple of years back at Animazement, we had this line of people

881
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,420
on one side, you had the ninjas, you had on the other side the pirates, we were shouting

882
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,180
back and forth, ninjas were better or pirates were better, got to the point where staff

883
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:24,340
had to break us all up, and then maybe about an hour later, we started a conga line singing

884
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,780
ninja rap all throughout the entire convention area.

885
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,520
Cons are so weird.

886
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,780
The funny thing about Anime Expo every year is that wherever they schedule it, they also

887
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:40,460
schedule some sort of religious convention, so you get the people preaching to the cosplayers

888
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:48,400
in line, and one year a bunch of us just started completely telling them off in various other

889
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,920
languages that weren't necessarily Japanese.

890
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,220
I know a lot of people that would pay a lot of money to see women beat each other up with

891
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,220
battles.

892
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,820
So you can get this all for free at your local anime convention?

893
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:06,820
Pretty much, and Jamie, there is a voice actor, his name is Vic, he's like a born-again Christian,

894
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:13,180
he's the voice of Ed from FMA, at Anime Conza, he has like a panel of Sunday morning service

895
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,900
for con-goers to come and arrive for service.

896
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,180
That's kinda cool.

897
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,180
That's kinda neat.

898
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,140
I've seen that happen at various conventions.

899
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,580
For people that want to do that, why not?

900
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,580
Why not?

901
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,580
Definitely.

902
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:33,300
Here's another quote that I love from RossioUT in chat, it says, this is different from console

903
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,300
fanboys.

904
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,300
How?

905
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,300
Xbox!

906
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,300
PlayStation!

907
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,300
Xbox!

908
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,300
PlayStation!

909
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,300
Wii!

910
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:45,540
I don't know about you guys, but I'd rather see a bunch of girls in cute outfits screaming

911
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:50,460
yaoi vs yuri than a bunch of fanboys shouting what console is better, you know?

912
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,260
I'd have to agree with you there.

913
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,260
Yeah.

914
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,100
Alright, Rama, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

915
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,100
A couple of things.

916
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,100
Yeah.

917
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,960
The 360 with the missing autographs, if it was me, I would have bit the bullet and bought

918
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,380
a new console.

919
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,380
What?

920
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,260
I would have done the same thing.

921
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,340
Yeah, that's exactly what I would have done.

922
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:14,740
But even, but they gave him back, the problem wasn't that he didn't have a working console,

923
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:15,740
I don't get it.

924
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,900
I wouldn't have left that to fate.

925
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,300
I would not have put something that valuable in the hands of other people.

926
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,300
I get it.

927
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,300
I get it.

928
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,500
So you would never have sent the console in to be repaired in the first place?

929
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Exactly.

930
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,500
Okay, okay.

931
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,500
That's fair.

932
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,500
And Rob?

933
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,500
Yep.

934
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,540
I used to be a member of Prodigy as well.

935
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,540
What was your username?

936
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,500
Do you remember?

937
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,180
I think it was Ronmecoon76 or something like that.

938
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,180
That's not old school.

939
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,180
That's not old school.

940
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,900
You don't have the random letters and numbers?

941
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:51,020
No, no, no, see, I got into Prodigy during the age of Windows and stuff like that.

942
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,020
Oh, no, no, no, no.

943
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,020
That's what I got on.

944
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,020
Oh, no, no, no.

945
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,020
I had Prodigy.

946
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,020
You go way old school, yeah.

947
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:01,100
I had DOS-based Prodigy, HWPD42B.

948
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:05,620
I remember Radio Shack stores had Prodigy set up for people who were free to try out

949
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,620
and stuff.

950
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,620
Yep.

951
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,660
That's how we found out about it the first time.

952
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,780
And you know what happened to Prodigy, right?

953
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,020
Then they get absolved into, basically they're like an ISP now, aren't they?

954
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,660
Or they're a part of Yahoo, aren't they?

955
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,660
Not really.

956
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,160
They're like the red-headed bastard stepchild of AT&T.

957
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,300
Like about one or two years ago, they were trying to sell off the name and everybody,

958
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,380
the whole thing, to the highest bidder, and they're still trying to do that.

959
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,180
Well, they got their asses handed to them by AOL, which is kind of sad because Prodigy

960
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,580
was really rad for a couple of years when they were the only ones that had that DOS

961
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,580
thing.

962
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,580
That was awesome.

963
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,580
That's awesome.

964
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,580
Yeah.

965
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,580
That's awesome.

966
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,180
All right, DJ Romans, we got to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

967
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,180
It's fun as always.

968
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,180
One more thing.

969
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,180
One more thing.

970
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,180
I promise I'm not here.

971
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,180
Hurry.

972
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,940
You'll never guess what my first game console was.

973
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,940
What?

974
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,260
ColecoVision Adam.

975
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,780
Which is ironic if people know you very well.

976
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,780
Mm-hmm.

977
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,820
I'll see you guys later.

978
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,820
Take care, Rama.

979
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,820
All right.

980
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,820
Bye.

981
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:05,820
Or should I say ColecoVision?

982
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,820
All right.

983
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,820
ColecoMan!

984
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,820
If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call.

985
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,820
Maristia2877 specialize.

986
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,820
My name's Maristia2877.

987
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,820
Our user name on Skype is OrangeloungeRadio.

988
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:21,140
Meanwhile, I did actually get a last-minute news story from somebody.

989
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,460
Where is it?

990
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,480
Here it is.

991
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,460
Is the video game industry recession-proof, a story that was run on MSN?

992
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,700
Video game companies think that they might be able to survive the slowing down of the

993
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,700
economy.

994
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:43,260
Apparently, video games have defied the sagging retail sales figures of December 2007.

995
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,620
Nintendo actually talked to CNBC, specifically Reggie Fils-Aime, said that his company in

996
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:52,140
particular was weathering the coming storm and that video games seem to do well in tougher

997
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,140
economic times.

998
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,260
Well, come on, if you're a Nintendo Wii right now, you're one of the few people that's doing

999
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,700
very well, right?

1000
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,940
It's interesting, his MSNBC story kind of gets into talking about the history and all

1001
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,260
this other stuff as well, so check that out if you want to.

1002
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,260
Meantime, we have another call.

1003
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,220
I was going to say I have a couple of last-minute stories after this.

1004
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,340
We'll get to those right after this call.

1005
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,260
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio, who's this?

1006
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,780
Hi, this is Ospurr.

1007
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,260
Ospurr, what's on your mind?

1008
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,500
I always horribly mispronounce your name, apparently.

1009
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:24,260
I always say Ospurr like I'm drunk talking to the policeman, but it's Ospurr.

1010
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,580
It's Ospurr, so my bad.

1011
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,220
So what's on your mind, Ospurr?

1012
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,100
That's all right.

1013
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:33,860
It's just pretty interesting with the whole yaoi-yuri argument, and I'm actually going

1014
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:38,460
to be going to my first convention in May, so I'll be sure to look out for that.

1015
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:42,260
You know what, yeah, just avoid the women that have the yaoi-yuri paddles unless you're

1016
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,260
into that.

1017
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,260
Watch out for the free hugs.

1018
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,260
You don't know if they've been tested.

1019
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:50,980
Yeah, if somebody's wearing a glomp sign, run the other way.

1020
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:54,380
I want to experience full on, so I'm actually going to go run towards them for the heck

1021
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,380
of it.

1022
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,620
Okay, don't say we didn't warn you, bud.

1023
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,420
Rama wants to know what con it is.

1024
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,020
I think it's Anime Central.

1025
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,020
It's in Illinois.

1026
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,020
That's ASEN.

1027
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,260
That's the one that we're wanting to go to.

1028
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,020
Yeah, we're thinking about going.

1029
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,340
That's a big one.

1030
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,740
Oh, that's pretty cool.

1031
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,740
Yeah.

1032
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,740
We'll see.

1033
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,740
I don't know.

1034
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,740
It's probably too late to get a panel on that and all that stuff.

1035
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,740
We'll see.

1036
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,740
Not necessarily.

1037
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:18,740
Hmm.

1038
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,740
Maybe we might have to make that happen.

1039
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,180
If not, we could always do the OLR hospitality suite or something silly.

1040
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,180
I don't know.

1041
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,180
We'll think of something.

1042
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,180
Yeah.

1043
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,940
Yeah, we're still plotting.

1044
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:27,940
I don't know.

1045
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,180
If it doesn't happen this year, then for sure next year, because we definitely want to make

1046
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,180
ASEN a goal of ours.

1047
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,700
We know we have a lot of folks in the Midwest that want to meet us, and I want to meet them.

1048
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,700
So we'll see.

1049
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,700
We'll see.

1050
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,700
Well, good luck at that con.

1051
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:43,300
Anything else you wanted to talk to us about tonight?

1052
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,180
Just been playing lots of Brawl.

1053
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,180
What are your thoughts on Brawl?

1054
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,180
Did they get it right?

1055
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,180
Was it worth the wait?

1056
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:55,640
Yeah, I'd say it's definitely worth the wait, but really my only frustration is with the

1057
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,640
online play.

1058
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,060
So I just can't freaking connect and play against anyone.

1059
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,780
Is your Wii far away from your Wi-Fi router?

1060
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:08,180
No, it's only like 10 feet away from it.

1061
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,180
Oh, weird.

1062
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,220
You know, I did play online.

1063
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,540
I haven't gotten the friends thing to work.

1064
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,220
I'm going to try tonight after the show.

1065
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:20,180
But I have heard, or I did play the random people one, which is a little silly because

1066
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,940
it's just like playing the computer pretty much, except you know somebody real is controlling

1067
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:24,940
it.

1068
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:25,940
But it wasn't bad.

1069
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,860
It was relatively lag-free, so I was pretty excited.

1070
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:35,940
Oh yeah, I just kept on getting error codes and it would just cut me out saying the transmission

1071
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,340
has ended or something like that.

1072
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,960
I was just like, what the heck?

1073
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,940
But I haven't actually tried doing it through friend codes, so I don't know, maybe that'll

1074
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:42,940
work better.

1075
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:43,940
Who knows?

1076
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,180
All right, well anything else on your mind tonight, Ospher?

1077
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,820
No, that's about it.

1078
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,700
All right, well thanks so much for the phone call.

1079
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:56,100
You have a good week, and try to take that Smash Brothers in limitation.

1080
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,500
Don't OD on it, okay?

1081
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,500
Yeah.

1082
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,500
Okay.

1083
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Take care, buddy.

1084
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,500
All right, see ya.

1085
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,500
All right.

1086
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,060
That's going to do it for tonight's Skypline.

1087
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:07,140
Thank you guys so much for your calls, and if you didn't get through tonight, don't worry,

1088
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,260
there's always next week.

1089
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,300
Or you can always leave us a voicemail.

1090
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,300
We do play the voicemails once in a while.

1091
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,260
I know we didn't play them tonight, but we'll probably get to some more next week.

1092
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,580
1-877-GAME-OLR whenever we're not live.

1093
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,780
So you said you had some last minute stories, Lucky?

1094
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,780
Yes, real quick here.

1095
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,020
There's two things.

1096
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:31,620
At show Dexter, you may have heard about, they're actually now starting to replay it

1097
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:40,660
on CVS, but it's about a serial killer who, instead of going around killing other people,

1098
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,820
he goes around killing serial killers.

1099
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,260
So they kind of fight his urge.

1100
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:49,640
It's currently running Showtime, and apparently they're making a game from it.

1101
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,780
So that's kind of interesting.

1102
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,820
The other thing is the game Turning Point.

1103
01:02:54,820 --> 01:03:01,220
Apparently the reviews haven't been too good for it, and according to Turning Point's CEO

1104
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:08,420
of the company Spark Unlimited, he's quoted that Turning Point is too high concept for

1105
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:11,460
reviewers.

1106
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,920
It wasn't for the critics, apparently.

1107
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:23,380
It was more, I guess, a game that was never meant for core gamers, or is meant for those

1108
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:28,360
who aren't wanting to look at a game with a critical eye, I guess.

1109
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:34,360
So he's basically saying that the game reviewers don't know how to review his game, because

1110
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,160
it was supposed to be crappy, I guess.

1111
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,160
I don't know.

1112
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,660
All right.

1113
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:45,680
I know his next game that they're doing, was it Legendary?

1114
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,420
That one that's by Gamecock, I guess?

1115
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,420
Legendary the Box?

1116
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,420
But now it's just Legendary.

1117
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,220
Who knows?

1118
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,420
All right.

1119
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,760
Well that is going to do it, I guess, for tonight's Last Minute Stories.

1120
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,760
That's it for now.

1121
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,760
All right.

1122
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,940
So that's going to bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1123
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:09,380
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting independent radio.

1124
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,440
You guys are awesome.

1125
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,060
I want to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts, and then actually we're breaking

1126
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,060
form a little bit tonight.

1127
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:19,540
I have one more story that's very important that we want to do at the very, very end.

1128
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,820
We're going to go around first and get everybody's final thoughts, Loki.

1129
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:29,700
My final thought is I want to finish Space Emissary Mode this week, and god damn it,

1130
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:35,140
I wish my 360, the other one I'm fixing, fucking works, because it's three-ringed and been

1131
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:39,740
fixed and three-ringed and sort of been fixed for weeks now.

1132
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:43,700
Now it's three-ringed right now, so I have to heat it up again, and I think it's just

1133
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,700
broken.

1134
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,500
But I've done so many mods to it that I kind of want it to be fixed, because it'll look

1135
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,300
like a Frankenstein's monster when I'm done.

1136
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,540
This is a long-ass final thought.

1137
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,300
It's a final muse.

1138
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,740
It's a final rant.

1139
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,180
I'm just messing with you, Loki.

1140
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,980
This show just wouldn't be the same without you.

1141
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,700
You know it.

1142
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,720
My final thought is I cannot wait for Wii Fit.

1143
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,720
I really can't.

1144
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,540
I think it's going to be very interesting.

1145
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,280
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

1146
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,260
Say no to bullshit.

1147
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,260
Really good final thought.

1148
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,200
Appreciate that.

1149
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,760
We are going to close tonight on this, and I hate to end the show on such a downer, but

1150
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,580
it is very important to acknowledge, and I'm sure if you have an internet connection, you've

1151
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:30,200
heard about it this week, we have to acknowledge the passing of Gary Gygax, which happened

1152
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,560
this week.

1153
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,940
You might not know the name, but you definitely know the legacy he left behind.

1154
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:39,980
He was the co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons and TSR, and let's face it, without Dungeons

1155
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,600
& Dragons, you would not have role-playing games like you have today.

1156
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,800
Think about all the games that were inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.

1157
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,360
I'm talking about everything from old school games like Ultima and the actual Dungeons

1158
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:58,680
& Dragons games that were on the Apple IIe and all that, and to everything that we have

1159
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,680
new today.

1160
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:04,320
The Final Fantasies of the World, the Warcrafts, and if you've actually played D&D, there actually

1161
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:10,040
are a lot of similarities between a huge game like World of Warcraft and this.

1162
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,440
Unfortunately, he did pass away this week at the age of 69.

1163
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,440
We do want to acknowledge the importance that this man had on the gaming industry, and certainly

1164
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,360
we not only want to dedicate everything we've done tonight to his memory, but we thought

1165
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,480
we'd close a little bit, again kind of breaking for him a little bit.

1166
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,820
We thought we'd close tonight with a song, because moments of silence are kind of awkward

1167
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:37,300
on podcasts, so we thought we'd instead play a song, and this song is from a game that

1168
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:41,600
was definitely, you could say, directly inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.

1169
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:46,440
It's the theme to Neverwinter Nights, and while we play this song, just maybe tip your

1170
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,680
hat, bow your head, say some final words for Gary Gygax, the creator of Dungeons & Dragons

1171
01:06:51,680 --> 01:07:17,360
who passed this week at the age of 69.

1172
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:48,360
Gary Gygax, the creator of Dungeons & Dragons who passed this week at the age of 69.

1173
01:08:48,360 --> 01:09:02,080
We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
