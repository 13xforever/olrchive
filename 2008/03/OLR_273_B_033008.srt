2
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this Part B of our podcast.

3
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:50,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the things coming to Xbox Live, like Darwinian, some Ikaruga, and the Penny Arcade game.

4
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:53,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're going to get into some Wii news, and we'll start off with Loki.

5
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:55,938
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, if you didn't listen to Part A, then you're a witch!

6
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:57,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you're a witch!

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, damn you.

8
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:03,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming to the Wii, and this is, ooh, big shock here.

9
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:06,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band was announced for the Wii.

10
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:10,750
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be getting the special edition, otherwise known as the one with all the instruments.

11
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is coming to, um...

12
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Retailers June 22nd for the small sum of $170.

13
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's almost the price of a Wii console.

14
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:26,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, there are a few things you should know about it.

15
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:29,419
[SPEAKER_07]: For one, the drum is white.

16
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And number two, it's going to contain five bonus songs.

17
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:40,767
[SPEAKER_07]: That's only because there are absolutely no downloads for this.

18
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:42,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Wah, wah.

19
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:43,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so...

20
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:45,003
[SPEAKER_07]: PlaySation 2

21
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:11,318
[SPEAKER_07]: and it will come with a powered USB hub, much like the Xbox 360 release.

22
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:17,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you really, I mean, honestly, people out there, did you really think that Rock Band on the Wii was going to have download content?

23
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:19,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, did you really think that?

24
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:21,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Because where would they put it?

25
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:23,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

26
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:29,731
[SPEAKER_06]: The only other thing they could do is already have it on the disc and then you, you know, download little unlock codes, but that would piss people off even more.

27
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it would piss people off.

28
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:35,696
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing I would, I don't know, maybe download it to SD memory cards.

29
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:52,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, I think that's what it's going to take, you know, somehow make your own file formats, because I know that Nintendo has their stupid block set up for game saves and stuff like that, but it doesn't necessarily mean programs have to use that.

30
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:55,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you look at it, you know, Smash Bros.

31
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:06,720
[SPEAKER_07]: has its own save data, you know, Excite Truck and Endless Ocean use MP3s, so who's to say that you couldn't make some sort of, like,

32
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:09,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Dream on on all that stuff, by the way.

33
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:09,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Just dream on.

34
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:10,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

35
00:03:36,107 --> 00:03:37,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I was choking on toast.

36
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:42,070
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, honestly, what my honest reaction though was when I heard that news about Rock Band being on the Wii?

37
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually, I was like, I thought it was already on the Wii.

38
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:50,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Because seriously, Rock Band's on like every system, just like Guitar Hero and all this.

39
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:52,755
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought Rock Band was already on the Wii.

40
00:03:53,316 --> 00:04:00,499
[SPEAKER_06]: But I, of course, did not make that my system of choice because I knew it wouldn't have the download songs and I knew it wouldn't be probably quite the graphical quality of the other versions.

41
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait until they shoehorn it onto the DS.

42
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:05,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that's just a matter of time, huh?

43
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:08,635
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be insane.

44
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:10,236
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have to use Wi-Fi, I think.

45
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:12,116
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do the drums with the stylus.

46
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:12,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Tap, tap, tap, tap.

47
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:14,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that would work.

48
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:16,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe make use of that Guitar Hero expansion.

49
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:18,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not, though.

50
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,100
[SPEAKER_06]: You would have a separate guitar that wouldn't be compatible with the other one.

51
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Just you wait.

52
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:31,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if singing is more your thing, it could be very soon that a SingStar-type clone is coming to the Wii.

53
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:32,965
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it's called JoySound.

54
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:38,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently Hudson is making this game called JoySound.

55
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:41,729
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be something you can actually get on WiiWare.

56
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:49,233
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll download this JoySound thing and you get it from a server that's being exclusively set up for that, whatever that is.

57
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:50,993
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the trick with it.

58
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:55,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of having to pay for individual songs, you subscribe to it.

59
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,357
[SPEAKER_06]: They're hoping to release it this summer in Japan.

60
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:04,780
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have 20,000 songs available at launch, 1,000 more every month.

61
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:12,567
[SPEAKER_07]: If they have that, I'm sorry, but that's sad for SingStar, especially when they're touting that they're going to have this huge long thing.

62
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:13,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And Karaoke Revolution.

63
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:14,948
[SPEAKER_07]: And Karaoke Revolution.

64
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, here's the funny thing.

65
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,289
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Hudson that's putting it up there.

66
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:28,412
[SPEAKER_07]: So imagine, if you will, they could do something like this and brand it with Karaoke Revolution, and boom, there you go.

67
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:31,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring that over to the U.S.,

68
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:39,130
[SPEAKER_06]: But with 20,000 songs, I can't help but think it's just going to be like MIDI songs.

69
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:39,990
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

70
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,871
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the quality of the songs is going to be really crap.

71
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:44,392
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be surprised.

72
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:47,113
[SPEAKER_07]: MP3s, I mean, they could do it that way.

73
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that wouldn't be that hard.

74
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:52,975
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

75
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:56,796
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually think it's kind of a neat setup and it's a different way of trying to do things.

76
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:59,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it all depends on price.

77
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

78
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember Iridium very vaguely, but I did play that.

79
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,829
[SPEAKER_09]: You're fighting aliens and stuff.

80
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:10,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And it apparently has elements from Gradius and Defender and a few others that are on there.

81
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:13,434
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's actually 500 Wii points.

82
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:19,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And before I forget to mention, International Karate is also 500 Wii points.

83
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:23,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really curious how those Commodore 64 games are going to translate over on the Wii.

84
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really curious to check that out.

85
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:29,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the other game that is out is Cruisin' U.S.A.,

86
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:33,887
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a Nintendo 64 game for a thousand Wii points.

87
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,772
[SPEAKER_09]: And, well, it's Cruisin' USA.

88
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:44,101
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably still controls just as badly, and it's still just as weird as it was before.

89
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:45,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, was it Cruisin' USA?

90
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:45,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

91
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:50,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to remember Cruisin' USA on Nintendo 64.

92
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:51,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember it was very good.

93
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:52,006
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

94
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:55,508
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68 says I wouldn't buy Cruisin' USA for even 100 Wii Points.

95
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, I'm thinking, I'm sorry, I'm thinking of Rush the Rock.

96
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Rush the Rock was okay.

97
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,951
[SPEAKER_07]: They had that on Nintendo 64, and no, that wasn't very good.

98
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:08,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Cruisin' USA, no, that probably wasn't very good either.

99
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Cruisin' World was a lot better.

100
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:12,655
[SPEAKER_07]: California Speed, not very good either.

101
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:16,257
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, all the games made by Midway that were racing...

102
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:17,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Not very good.

103
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:19,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Hydro Thunder.

104
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Hydro Thunder.

105
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,350
[SPEAKER_07]: The Thunder games are good.

106
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Hydro Thunder was brilliant.

107
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:26,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially on Dreamcast.

108
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:27,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only play that game in the arcades.

109
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:28,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't play it on console.

110
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:28,872
[SPEAKER_06]: No way.

111
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:30,532
[SPEAKER_09]: We had it on Dreamcast.

112
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:31,232
[SPEAKER_06]: No way way.

113
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:34,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what, it sucked on PlayStation.

114
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:36,814
[SPEAKER_09]: It sucked ass on PlayStation.

115
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:40,015
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

116
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:45,816
[SPEAKER_07]: In Japan, you're going to be able to get one of the games that Jamie's been super excited about for a while.

117
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:51,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Rondo of Blood or Dracula X Rondo of Blood is coming to the Japanese Virtual Console.

118
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:54,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that is the Turbo Duo version.

119
00:08:55,227 --> 00:09:00,029
[SPEAKER_07]: No word on how much it's going to cost you, but I mean, hey, that's pretty awesome.

120
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:10,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, I don't think we're going to see it come over here because that would mean it would need to be localized and no one wants to spend any time on something like that.

121
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:15,016
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you can play the Japanese version, awesome!

122
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:20,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, all the cutscenes had a text on them.

123
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:23,130
[SPEAKER_09]: All they'd have to do is just translate the text and not worry about the dialogue.

124
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:33,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's still effort, and you remember they don't want to put effort into these games.

125
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:36,794
[SPEAKER_06]: That is true.

126
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:41,655
[SPEAKER_07]: It is true, and so that wouldn't be that hard, but once again, it takes a little bit of effort to change all the text.

127
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, isn't the PSP version all graphiced up, too?

128
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:44,276
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all...

129
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but don't they have the original one on there too?

130
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:48,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they do.

131
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:49,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

132
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:50,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah.

133
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:50,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they?

134
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

135
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:55,578
[SPEAKER_07]: But they have, I think the original one, wasn't it Dracula X?

136
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:05,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not the new Rondo, or the... Yeah, while these guys get Dracula X Rondo of Blood, you know what we'll get on US Virtual Console?

137
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:06,783
[SPEAKER_09]: The stupid, crappy...

138
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:09,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Pooh version.

139
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,715
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it came out over here as Dracula X on Super Nintendo.

140
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:22,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was our Castlevania V. No, because the Dracula X series doesn't necessarily fall in with the actual Castlevania.

141
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:25,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Only there was a Castlevania V. No, there was a Castlevania V, I swear to God.

142
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:35,741
[SPEAKER_09]: We did get a Castlevania V, but it wasn't Dracula X. Castlevania V, in fact, I do believe it was re-released with the Castlevania Chronicles.

143
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:43,598
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm fairly positive that it was not Dracula X. Then you're right.

144
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:44,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I must be crazy.

145
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have sworn it was Castlevania V we got here.

146
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:49,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

147
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:52,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there was Super Castlevania IV and I don't remember what after that.

148
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:54,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Castlevania V came out on PlayStation if I'm remembering right.

149
00:10:59,307 --> 00:10:59,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Or no.

150
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:01,069
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Castlevania 64. 64.

151
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:04,487
[SPEAKER_06]: That does not exist.

152
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:05,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just crazy.

153
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:06,009
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

154
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:06,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not worth it.

155
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Castlevania 64 does not exist.

156
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,392
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not worth losing sleep over.

157
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not exist to you.

158
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:12,296
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dead to you.

159
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:12,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead to me.

160
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:19,764
[SPEAKER_09]: And to DarkTetsuya, technically Dracula XX was Nocturne in the Moonlight, which we got over here as Symphony of the Night.

161
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:29,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, some other systems games are making its way to the Virtual Console on the Nintendo Wii very soon.

162
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:34,077
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Sega Master System, and we mentioned this a couple shows ago, but now it is official.

163
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:45,143
[SPEAKER_06]: They are making their way to the North American Virtual Console, and they're going to cost 400 points a game, so it makes it the cheapest system of any of them out there, because it's only going to be 4 bucks a game.

164
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,544
[SPEAKER_06]: The NES games are 5 bucks a pop.

165
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:55,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of the first games that are going to be coming out that should be out soon, that probably means any week now, Wonder Boy and Fantasy Zone are going to be the first two that come out.

166
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:57,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantasy Zone, of course, was one of the classic games of the week.

167
00:11:58,223 --> 00:11:58,683
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

168
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:00,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Fantasy Zone's a good game, too.

169
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:08,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know if the Sega Master System port of it's my favorite, but, you know, it is, for four bucks, probably not a bad deal.

170
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,692
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll see what other types of Sega Master System games show up very soon.

171
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to correct myself.

172
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:15,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

173
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Symphony of the Night was X2.

174
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:21,203
[SPEAKER_09]: XX was the Super Nintendo release in Japan.

175
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:23,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Too confusing.

176
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:28,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn them for releasing completely different games over here in the US than they did over there.

177
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:28,567
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

178
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:29,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn them.

179
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn the man.

180
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:32,790
[SPEAKER_09]: They just should have brought it out over here.

181
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so... Well, I've had it on this show before.

182
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,673
[SPEAKER_09]: We hooked it up through the old setup.

183
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:39,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, very few people remember that.

184
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:40,335
[SPEAKER_06]: That was years ago.

185
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:42,376
[SPEAKER_09]: And did screen captures and everything through the webcam.

186
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:45,958
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was the whole German intro and everything.

187
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:50,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I like fantasy, by the way.

188
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:58,039
[SPEAKER_09]: So, another wonderful, wonderful game is going to be remade for WiiWare.

189
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,319
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

190
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:07,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is going to be one of the best pinball simulating games ever is Alien Crush.

191
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:15,022
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can actually download Alien Crush right now and play it on virtual console.

192
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:18,915
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's really, really, really happy.

193
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:22,737
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, there's only, of course, note for it being out in Japan.

194
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:24,258
[SPEAKER_09]: But we could get it.

195
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:27,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hope that we do, because hopefully Hudson loves us.

196
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, honestly, I would prefer to have Devil's Crush myself.

197
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:39,224
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens to... Because I have the original Alien Crush, so I guess I'm just going to have to have two.

198
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:44,246
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm understanding from this screen capture I'm seeing on here...

199
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:51,760
[SPEAKER_09]: is that instead of the top-down view, you actually have a slightly more diagonal overhead.

200
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like more traditional, or I shouldn't say more traditional, more newer.

201
00:13:58,122 --> 00:13:59,063
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

202
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:00,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, our speak grammar good.

203
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:00,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

204
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:05,025
[SPEAKER_06]: The current types of pinball games look like this.

205
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,986
[SPEAKER_09]: You're looking at it from an angled view, like you would be more accurately.

206
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:08,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Like an actual table.

207
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's more of an actual table layout.

208
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:16,500
[SPEAKER_09]: but Alien Crush is still pretty sexy.

209
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,962
[SPEAKER_09]: He played a whole crap load of Alien Crush.

210
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:21,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I think he played that game for an entire day once.

211
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:28,589
[SPEAKER_09]: And I still meant to bring over my Turbo Duo so he could play Devil's Crush at the time, but now it's out.

212
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and now he's not my roommate anymore, so, tear.

213
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:37,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe he'll get a Wii at some point, though, and buy the game to relive those memories all over again.

214
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:38,737
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

215
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:46,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, one thing he's not going to have made available to him is one of the brand new features to Club Nintendo.

216
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:56,639
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a memory card that you can get, an SD memory card, 128 megs worth of music from different Nintendo games.

217
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:08,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the songs that they have on there, of course, songs from Super Mario Sunshine, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Catch Touch Yoshi, that's kind of a weird name,

218
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:35,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendogs, Mario Kart Double Dash, Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker, Pikmin 2 and Super Mario Brothers and of course Club Nintendo is exclusively Japanese and they get all sorts of cool stuff including classic controllers that look like Super Famicom controllers and DS games for the Game & Watch stuff and that stupid Tingle balloon fight game

219
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,599
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is an official Nintendo product.

220
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:39,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

221
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet we know Nintendo kind of hates the SD card.

222
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,120
[SPEAKER_06]: So this thing is so weird to me.

223
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say they hate the SD card.

224
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they put damn SD... But they just use it for the weirdest stuff.

225
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:48,242
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

226
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:52,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, the most obvious things, like extra storage, they don't use it for.

227
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:56,844
[SPEAKER_06]: But this... I mean, like... What would you really use this on?

228
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:57,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, custom songs?

229
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can play these songs in Excite Truck.

230
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:01,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoopee!

231
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,646
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people remember Excite Truck?

232
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:04,386
[SPEAKER_06]: You and who else?

233
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:04,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Me!

234
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:05,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And who else?

235
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:05,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Nelly!

236
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,728
[SPEAKER_06]: KU, your wife, and who else?

237
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:10,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

238
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:15,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I can't help it if Excite Truck is the greatest racing game on the Wii.

239
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:16,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever.

240
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:18,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Until Excite Truck 2 comes out.

241
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:20,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, Nintendo.

242
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:21,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Sooner than later.

243
00:16:24,356 --> 00:16:27,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well guess what kind of story I've got for you guys right now.

244
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:36,063
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, when you hear that music, you know something really tragic has happened.

245
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:40,721
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is that another person has been killed over video games.

246
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:43,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least that's what the media wants you to believe.

247
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:56,254
[SPEAKER_06]: A 15-year-old boy was killed by his 18-year-old friend William Suarez because he refused to hand over the video game he was playing.

248
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,051
[SPEAKER_06]: So what did Suarez do?

249
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:07,140
[SPEAKER_06]: He whipped out a .32 caliber Smith & Wesson from his waistband, not Mommy and Daddy's closet, not under the bed.

250
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,405
[SPEAKER_06]: He whipped it out from his waistband and shot his 15-year-old friend in the head.

251
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:15,710
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this world coming to?

252
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:21,492
[SPEAKER_06]: The killer is 18 years old.

253
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:30,235
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been charged with manslaughter, illegal possession of a firearm, assault with a dangerous weapon, and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of the dwelling.

254
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:31,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Why manslaughter?

255
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:35,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I would think murder, if anything, because he intended to kill him.

256
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:39,178
[SPEAKER_07]: How about a bullet wound to the head?

257
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:40,218
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll scare him.

258
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:41,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give him the chair.

259
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Just give him the chair already.

260
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:53,753
[SPEAKER_06]: A quote from the article, witnesses told authorities that Suarez then put the gun down on the kitchen counter and began saying, this just didn't happen.

261
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:58,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of like he went crazy or something, I don't know.

262
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:03,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's the question, did video games really have anything to do with this?

263
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, no.

264
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,060
[SPEAKER_06]: But yet, here are the headlines that are coming out.

265
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:13,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Family, game led to teen's murder.

266
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Video game linked to fatal shooting in Brockton.

267
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:22,473
[SPEAKER_09]: More like Psycho killed Kid.

268
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:24,253
[SPEAKER_09]: End of story.

269
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:25,914
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sad.

270
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:28,955
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be the same thing as if he had a Furby a few years ago.

271
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:33,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a Tickle Me Elmo or whatever the fuck it was called.

272
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:35,057
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they need to do to this kid?

273
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:37,598
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to burn him.

274
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:38,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he's a witch!

275
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:43,080
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's much, much worse than that.

276
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Being a witch is not bad.

277
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:49,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Being a psycho murderer is.

278
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:59,104
[SPEAKER_07]: You see, I thought he had two lives and so that's why I didn't know he would be dead forever.

279
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you News Media, by the way, for...

280
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:10,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm blowing this story completely out of proportion.

281
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:39,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitch, come back on Imagine Babies.

282
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:40,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

283
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:43,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not funny.

284
00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:44,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not laughing at that, I swear.

285
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:45,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

286
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,919
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it really isn't funny.

287
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:47,859
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

288
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:48,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not funny.

289
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

290
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:52,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sick.

291
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:55,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And it makes me angsty.

292
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:57,842
[SPEAKER_06]: You know after those types of stories.

293
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,562
[SPEAKER_06]: You know this part of the show is coming up.

294
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,643
[SPEAKER_06]: The F-Use of the Week.

295
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And an F you to the ferret?

296
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:23,173
[SPEAKER_09]: The ferret had to get a few things out from being stuck in your closet for how long?

297
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:31,740
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to... Well, I don't really want to say F you to California Burger because really all I wanted was the pastrami.

298
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,982
[SPEAKER_09]: But they didn't give me the burger that was supposed to go with the pastrami.

299
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:36,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel deprived of meat.

300
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:39,385
[SPEAKER_09]: So F you to that.

301
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:46,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to my lack of fundage for the presents.

302
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:50,044
[SPEAKER_09]: A big FU poopy ball to that.

303
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:51,765
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to money.

304
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, money is just FU to lack of money.

305
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:55,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

306
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:56,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

307
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:08,992
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to people who drive big trucks that can't figure out where in the lane they're supposed to be because, you know, for some reason when people need to make a left turn, they start heading towards the right and cutting into my lane and then they make their left turn because their truck's too big.

308
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,773
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my fault you bought a big truck.

309
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:13,114
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't mean you have to run me off the road.

310
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:27,925
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm about to enter my fourth week of having pains that float around my abdomen, my back, my stomach, and no one knows what's wrong with me still.

311
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:30,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a blood test on Tuesday.

312
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:31,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still waiting on the results.

313
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going for Alien Chess Popper.

314
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,148
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I hope not.

315
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:37,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I guess that would be kind of cool.

316
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:40,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if I'm going to go, let's go out with a bang like that.

317
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:41,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not, huh?

318
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But

319
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:44,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have the special?

320
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:45,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have the special?

321
00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:45,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, um...

322
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,991
[SPEAKER_09]: This might still make people angsty.

323
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:07,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, but I didn't make it.

324
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:16,595
[SPEAKER_09]: GameStop is not going to be carrying Game Boy and Game Boy Color stuff, games, systems, crap that goes with it.

325
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Hoping to have it all wiped out by the end of April.

326
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:21,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know they were still carrying Game Boy.

327
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

328
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:24,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not angsty about it.

329
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised they still got it.

330
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can always go to GameCrazy for that stuff.

331
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,272
[SPEAKER_07]: or playing trade or any other mom and pops out there.

332
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Or buy yourself a freaking Game Boy Advance and get with the times already.

333
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:36,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus.

334
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:41,418
[SPEAKER_09]: But there were some really, really good games that were old Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.

335
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:45,100
[SPEAKER_06]: But those old games will work on the Game Boy Advance.

336
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,881
[SPEAKER_09]: They will.

337
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:51,304
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they're not going to be selling the games, you have to go to the little trader places.

338
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:52,125
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

339
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:52,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

340
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:56,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet, I do have to admit, one of the cutest Game Boys I ever had.

341
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I gave it to my sister.

342
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,189
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the stupidest thing I ever did.

343
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:05,212
[SPEAKER_06]: But I had a Game Boy Color that when you turned it on, it had a little Pikachu around the power thing.

344
00:23:05,272 --> 00:23:07,914
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it looked like his cheeks lit up because the power was on.

345
00:23:08,894 --> 00:23:11,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was Pichu, not Pikachu, but you know what I mean.

346
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:14,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a pink Game Boy Advance.

347
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:16,038
[SPEAKER_06]: How girly.

348
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:19,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is me who isn't like the uber girly girl.

349
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I just...

350
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:21,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted a pink one.

351
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:23,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I wanted them because they were hard to get.

352
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine was clear and has no backlight.

353
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:29,013
[SPEAKER_09]: We put a backlight in mine.

354
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:35,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to use those stupid little reading light things that would clip to the top so you could actually see the screen.

355
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:37,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, Nintendo.

356
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:39,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a friend put an afterburner in mine.

357
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:44,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're just happy about having a chance to take apart something technological.

358
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:56,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you may not be able to get Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but one game you will be able to get probably pretty soon is the sequel to 50 Cent Bulletproof.

359
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:57,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's a brand new game.

360
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:03,650
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 Cent to Blood in the Sand.

361
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And my god, is it shit.

362
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,173
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically, if I remember the premise of it correct,

363
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:31,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Fitty goes to the Middle East to perform for somebody and the promoter doesn't have the money to pay him so instead of paying him money he pays him in a diamond encrusted skull which gets stolen by I can only assume terrorists and then it's up to Fitty to get the skull back.

364
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:36,122
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya says, please tell me this is an early April Fool's Day joke.

365
00:24:36,162 --> 00:24:36,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm afraid it's not.

366
00:24:36,862 --> 00:24:38,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost kind of want to agree.

367
00:25:01,805 --> 00:25:02,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, though.

368
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:08,948
[SPEAKER_06]: You do bring up an interesting point, Loki, is that if it's almost like self-parody or something, it's actually kind of funny.

369
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:10,828
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think it is.

370
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:14,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's trying to make it out like, dude, it's 50 Cent fighting terrorists.

371
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,571
[SPEAKER_07]: How much more American do you need?

372
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:20,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he shits red, white, and blue.

373
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,792
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how American it is.

374
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:25,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, no more taking on gangbangers.

375
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:28,774
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now time to take on terrorists.

376
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:30,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Hurrah.

377
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

378
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:35,053
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... And people will buy it!

379
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:45,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the first thing I thought of when I heard there was a sequel to this game is I thought, you mean Bulletproof 1 sold enough copies to necessitate this?

380
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:47,643
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

381
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:54,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just... I wanted to make sure I have the correct, um... What was it?

382
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:57,771
[SPEAKER_07]: The, uh... The correct name for all this stuff.

383
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:58,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think...

384
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:06,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I am pretty positive that was the actual plot to this.

385
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if this is trying to be like, you know how some movies are so bad they're actually kind of good, like Showgirls?

386
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:13,953
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be like the Showgirls of video gaming.

387
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:15,394
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so bad, it's pretty funny.

388
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:15,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Rob.

389
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:16,314
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

390
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:17,655
[SPEAKER_09]: You are a whore.

391
00:26:19,436 --> 00:26:21,197
[SPEAKER_09]: You made me sit down and watch that movie and I love it.

392
00:26:21,237 --> 00:26:22,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's awesome.

393
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:29,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Bulletproof sold, it was a multi-million dollar, or multi-million copy selling game.

394
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember it selling more than one.

395
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's buying it?

396
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

397
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:41,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Blend the Sand is something more exotic, more Hollywood blockbuster.

398
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:50,007
[SPEAKER_07]: This game sets 50s character against a cabal of international gangsters on a far-flung, bullet-ridden adventure.

399
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:54,732
[SPEAKER_07]: It's inspired by Three Kings meets Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.

400
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:56,805
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely a crime story.

401
00:26:58,926 --> 00:27:10,613
[SPEAKER_07]: The developer credited 50 with pushing the game's creators to consider novel locations and said that MC played a big part in crafting the game's still-secret story.

402
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:15,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

403
00:27:15,976 --> 00:27:21,819
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess the game will run on the Unreal 3 engine because every other fucking game on the face of the earth runs on the...

404
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:23,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

405
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:23,795
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

406
00:27:47,355 --> 00:27:51,216
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a lot of games out there for the urban market and stuff like this does do really well actually so it's just crazy.

407
00:28:15,316 --> 00:28:16,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Even this?

408
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:17,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Even this?

409
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:18,237
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing, though.

410
00:28:18,277 --> 00:28:25,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it sounds like that they're actually putting some effort into the game because, I mean, the first one was pretty cinematic.

411
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:26,701
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just kind of retarded.

412
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:32,044
[SPEAKER_07]: But this one, you know, being that it's on the Unreal 3 engine and stuff like that, I mean, I don't know.

413
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:33,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to see how it looks.

414
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:34,685
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, the whole thing sounds ridiculous.

415
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:35,806
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

416
00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:36,766
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

417
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:39,423
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

418
00:28:58,065 --> 00:28:58,646
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

419
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,406
[SPEAKER_06]: as the months will go on.

420
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:22,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So who knows?

421
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,087
[SPEAKER_06]: But I imagine the shirts will be more expensive.

422
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:25,968
[SPEAKER_07]: They should try GameStop.

423
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:30,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know I hate to push GameStop, but I mean... Or other game box stores.

424
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:31,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, gaming chains.

425
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:32,669
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be perfect.

426
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:38,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, I don't know, allow them to be purchased on their website from independent retailers out there.

427
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:41,232
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the way to do it, I would think.

428
00:29:41,952 --> 00:29:42,192
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

429
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:43,176
[SPEAKER_06]: No, only a few.

430
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:43,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Depressing.

431
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, hey, we got some spam in the interim as well.

432
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:13,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray.

433
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,101
[SPEAKER_09]: And another couple emails.

434
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:19,745
[SPEAKER_09]: So actually, I might just be generous and read the two new ones that came in as well.

435
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,469
[SPEAKER_09]: So starting off, this one says, Hi, all.

436
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:30,363
[SPEAKER_09]: First, sorry for not contacting you before, but I've been listening to your show via iTunes podcasts for about 18 months.

437
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:31,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Big fan of DarkSakura.

438
00:30:31,884 --> 00:30:32,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.

439
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And wouldn't like to miss hearing her every week.

440
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:36,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, thank you.

441
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:51,900
[SPEAKER_09]: So on that note, have you ever looked into using, I guess it's ustream.tv, stickcam.com with chat, plus storage for shows and have been used by Leo Laporte for TWIT TV?

442
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,461
[SPEAKER_07]: This week in tech.

443
00:30:54,011 --> 00:30:55,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, okay.

444
00:30:55,432 --> 00:31:01,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, basically, it lists a whole bunch of other things, but as we've announced earlier in the show, we've got our plan.

445
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:07,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and Ustream TV, actually, we actually have a channel on Ustream TV, we just never used it.

446
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we were originally going to go with Ustream TV.

447
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,820
[SPEAKER_06]: We made a last-minute decision to switch to Justin TV.

448
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,101
[SPEAKER_06]: That was after the Operator 11 fallout because I remember we were using them for a little while.

449
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:21,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd actually created the Ustream TV account with the intention of going over there.

450
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:21,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

451
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:24,143
[SPEAKER_06]: There was something about Justin TV I just liked a little better.

452
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:31,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I think I like the way that fans could go in and cut out the highlight clips and you could upload things to YouTube and import things from YouTube.

453
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:34,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt Justin TV had a little more of the functionality.

454
00:31:34,045 --> 00:31:38,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ustream seemed a little too big for me.

455
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:38,790
[SPEAKER_06]: for me.

456
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:39,711
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

457
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,131
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a lot more interactive, I think.

458
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:42,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like Justin TV a little more.

459
00:31:42,952 --> 00:31:44,033
[SPEAKER_06]: We prefer cozy.

460
00:31:44,313 --> 00:31:45,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a little more cozy.

461
00:31:46,294 --> 00:31:46,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

462
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:59,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, just to continue with the email, also TalkShoe.com does a live audio broadcast with chat room, but it needs to be downloaded first order to use the live server, and you can also record the shows as you do them, which are available in the show archive.

463
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:00,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that helps.

464
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:02,823
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, sorry and hope you find a solution soon.

465
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:04,364
[SPEAKER_09]: All the best, Steve in the UK.

466
00:32:05,578 --> 00:32:08,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hopefully you'll be pleased with the earlier news about our solution.

467
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,521
[SPEAKER_06]: We're pretty excited about it.

468
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:10,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Voltron!

469
00:32:10,202 --> 00:32:13,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is pretty much sort of what we had kind of thought already.

470
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:16,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Next email.

471
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:18,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, gentlemen and lady.

472
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I just watched Dead Fantasy 2.

473
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:24,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you guys have seen the first one.

474
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:26,255
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nothing compared to the second.

475
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think that it's amazing that someone could do this in their spare time.

476
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I've looked at it several times now and can't help but wonder what DarkSakura thought.

477
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I haven't seen it yet.

478
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:37,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I know she loves her fighting games in Final Fantasy.

479
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:43,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Monty Ohm has said that there are at least five more in the series.

480
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but I've got a few questions.

481
00:32:47,662 --> 00:32:51,344
[SPEAKER_09]: With the latest surprising characters, who do you think might make an appearance next?

482
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:53,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally, which side will win in the end?

483
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:57,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Seems the Final Fantasy team has an unfair advantage by using both weapons and magic.

484
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:59,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be surprised if they win, though.

485
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:05,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly, I don't have the time to listen to the show live, but I've always downloaded the podcast.

486
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:08,998
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems that there are always regular live listeners to support the show.

487
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,702
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys can find a suitable alternative to Live 365, then how about a fundraiser?

488
00:33:13,302 --> 00:33:20,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it sounds a bit corny, but I've come to like the show very much and would hate to see any changes that would cripple the community that has grown around it.

489
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:22,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be... I'll...

490
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:30,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be more than willing to donate money to keep the show going, and I'm sure most of the live listeners would as well.

491
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for getting me through a rough day.

492
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:33,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from Recymo.

493
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:44,074
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be honest, we disagree with what Live 365 is doing, and it's more or less the point that we don't want to support what they're doing, no matter if we can afford it or not.

494
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:45,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

495
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:46,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, the FU music came in there.

496
00:33:46,915 --> 00:33:47,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

497
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:48,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, where the hell is that music going?

498
00:33:48,937 --> 00:33:50,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's appropriate, so it's alright.

499
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:50,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

500
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:54,123
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, again, thank you for the wonderful offer.

501
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:58,346
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we have another plan that we think will help actually grow our community a little bit.

502
00:33:58,386 --> 00:34:07,252
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Jamie, here's a little sneak peek of Dead Fantasy 2, which shows the... It's basically... I did watch some of it.

503
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:12,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just one giant fanboy orgasm in real form.

504
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... What is it?

505
00:34:14,237 --> 00:34:18,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just special effect after special effect after...

506
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:20,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to watch that one again.

507
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:22,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I see dead or alive people.

508
00:34:35,936 --> 00:34:39,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, it's Dead or Alive characters versus Final Fantasy.

509
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:42,718
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just one giant fanboy orgasm.

510
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:43,759
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

511
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Riku just got thrown in that clip there.

512
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:46,640
[SPEAKER_06]: That's lovely.

513
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry, I know that makes for horrible radio, but I wanted to show Jamie a little clip of that.

514
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:51,901
[SPEAKER_09]: That's completely awesome.

515
00:34:52,982 --> 00:35:01,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And we got an email from HeroAntagonist, which was a link, and it said, this seemed like something you'd want to see if you haven't already.

516
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:05,426
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a bizarre twist between DDR Beatmania and a slot machine.

517
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:09,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I have something for him, that is, if he's still listening to the show.

518
00:35:09,995 --> 00:35:16,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if you've seen this yet, but on YouTube there's a blind gamer who goes by the nickname

519
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:41,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Geniuses Corruption, who has played through Zelda Ocarina of Time, Zelda Twilight Princess, and Castlevania Circle of the Moon, and posted videos of his conquests.

520
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:42,761
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see his page.

521
00:35:43,222 --> 00:35:47,143
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, again, Geniuses Corruption, geniuses being plural.

522
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:56,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Given that he has proven he is blind through the front page video of him beating a boss blindfolded, it just goes to show that even blind gamers can play video games.

523
00:35:56,636 --> 00:35:58,697
[SPEAKER_09]: To Ranma of India, you are not alone.

524
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:03,039
[SPEAKER_09]: There are other gamers out there who were born blind and they play video games, so can you.

525
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:04,700
[SPEAKER_09]: That's from GS68.

526
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched it.

527
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:07,041
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually pretty cool.

528
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:10,923
[SPEAKER_09]: The game he was playing in... Oh, crap.

529
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:11,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I lost the link.

530
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:12,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh...

531
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:14,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I closed it, sorry.

532
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:19,827
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was playing through a GameCube game and doing fairly decently.

533
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:26,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheeseburger sent us a giant ASCII finger that says to live 365.

534
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:29,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Cheeseburger.

535
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,737
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very nice ASCII art.

536
00:36:31,977 --> 00:36:33,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very impressed.

537
00:36:33,678 --> 00:36:37,121
[SPEAKER_09]: J-Rod emailed one of the two that we got recently.

538
00:36:37,944 --> 00:36:40,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi OLR crew, love the show, keep up the awesome job.

539
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:49,195
[SPEAKER_09]: What I was writing about was concerning deeper characters and themes in video games and how long you think it will be before we actually start seeing this type of stuff in games.

540
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:55,041
[SPEAKER_09]: We are recently seeing a much greater character portrayal and writing with emotions like love with games like Mass Effect and others.

541
00:36:55,661 --> 00:37:06,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see deep and mature storylines involving other things and emotions that are quote too hot for video games to deal with like racism, sexism, homosexuality and various other things.

542
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:14,154
[SPEAKER_09]: American History X and Schindler's List are very powerful and well done films that deal with very mature subjects and are in good taste.

543
00:37:14,595 --> 00:37:24,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like companies such as Rockstar putting out games like Manhunt are actually setting us backwards when it comes to being taken seriously compared to other forms of entertainment like movies and books.

544
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:30,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is this email sponsored by Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.

545
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:30,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

546
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:47,196
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good thought.

547
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:49,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Japanese games have been doing it for a while.

548
00:37:49,537 --> 00:37:51,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to play these types of games.

549
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:52,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be a lot of fun.

550
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:59,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, you only really see it in the occasional role-playing game that has the more mature themes, but I think it would be fun.

551
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think they'd sell well is the unfortunate thing.

552
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:10,809
[SPEAKER_06]: In Hollywood, you can make a big budget movie, lots of special effects and explosions.

553
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:14,391
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make a big budget movie, or you can make a small budget movie that costs a lot less to make.

554
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:15,426
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

555
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:44,868
[SPEAKER_06]: A, doesn't get a lot of exposure, and B, usually the indie stuff is innovating on different types of gameplay, not necessarily new themes in game formats that we've already seen, if that makes sense.

556
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:52,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when you talk about exploring those types of themes, well, you can't really do a lot of that in a puzzle game.

557
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:59,220
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about types of games that are really involved with story, so that's basically RPG and those types of games.

558
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:02,103
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't see a lot of really...

559
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,729
[SPEAKER_06]: polished indie efforts in those realms, if that makes sense.

560
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's why you're right.

561
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:11,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a long time, unfortunately, before we see something like this.

562
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:21,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And what it's going to take is it's going to take video games getting even bigger and bigger so that more and more money and there's more budgets for different types of experiments and try things.

563
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:25,983
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it would be great to have some of those things you mentioned.

564
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:33,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, like I said, quite a few games have come out overseas that

565
00:39:33,895 --> 00:39:36,376
[SPEAKER_09]: dealt with deeper topics, but we won't get them over here.

566
00:39:39,016 --> 00:39:45,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Last email from Mr. D. Big wave from across the pond to Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.

567
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:50,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a UK listener who occasionally listens live and am as I write this.

568
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:50,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.

569
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:50,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

570
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:55,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I must be crazy since the show starts about 1 to 2 a.m.

571
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:02,061
[SPEAKER_09]: here, but I often find myself not getting a lot of sleep during the early hours of Monday morning due to having frequent uni deadlines.

572
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:02,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

573
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:05,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Your show keeps me going, so thanks.

574
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:12,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, DarkSakura's talk of Grandia reminded me of something I've been thinking about previously, memorable RPG moments.

575
00:40:12,783 --> 00:40:15,504
[SPEAKER_06]: My memory of... Damn, that was fast.

576
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:18,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you just brought up Grandia like an hour ago.

577
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:20,027
[SPEAKER_06]: That's instant gratification.

578
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:20,527
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

579
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:21,007
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, sorry.

580
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:29,261
[SPEAKER_09]: My memory of Grandia is really patchy, and I found the crossing of the wall that marks the end of the world to be very memorable.

581
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,944
[SPEAKER_09]: What are your most memorable RPG scenes?

582
00:40:32,524 --> 00:40:33,825
[SPEAKER_09]: To stop right there...

583
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:35,913
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of them.

584
00:40:36,093 --> 00:40:42,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the whole ghost ship part in Grandia I thought was really just awesome.

585
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:45,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to be cliche, but come on.

586
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:55,438
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole, you know who... Well, the opera in 6, but the you know who dies in Final Fantasy 7 was really emotional and a really big step in games at that time.

587
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:57,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to be cliche, but that really is the one that comes to mind.

588
00:40:58,019 --> 00:40:59,319
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really emotional for me too, Rob.

589
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,099
[SPEAKER_06]: You emotionally overjoyed.

590
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I cheered so loudly, and I was like, yes!

591
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:17,633
[SPEAKER_09]: and I still to this day have my card with the stupid Hobag's death saved on it because I laughed my ass off and I spent the whole time screaming at Jenova so I can get to that part and watch the death.

592
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give an answer that maybe the guy wasn't looking for, but I'll kind of take it in a different direction.

593
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:26,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say games like World of Warcraft.

594
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:31,669
[SPEAKER_06]: When you do things with your guild, like for instance, I have a guild of mostly people I know offline.

595
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,012
[SPEAKER_06]: We have maybe a handful of OLR listeners in there, but not a few.

596
00:41:35,052 --> 00:41:37,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I've plugged it like a million times, I guess you all don't want to play WoW with us.

597
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:38,334
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

598
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:39,035
[SPEAKER_06]: See if I care.

599
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:47,218
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, we have this guild on there and we're currently raiding Karazhan because we finally have enough people who are level 70 to start doing some of the 10-man raids.

600
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:59,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll tell you what, when we finally get the strategy down to beat one of the bosses, such as Maiden of Virtue, was one of those bosses where like the first couple times we went in there and did it, oh my god, she was so tough.

601
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:02,024
[SPEAKER_06]: But then we were finally able to overcome that and beat her.

602
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:05,745
[SPEAKER_06]: We were like so happy and like so excited because we really accomplished something, you know.

603
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:09,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not like, oh my gosh, I'm going to run out naked through the streets.

604
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:09,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so happy.

605
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:13,897
[SPEAKER_06]: But there definitely is that emotion of, hey, look, we accomplished this together.

606
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:14,518
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty rad.

607
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:19,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess.

608
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:20,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

609
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of a different type of answer.

610
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily a scripted thing, but working together towards a common goal.

611
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:32,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I still laughed my ass off in Final Fantasy VII, by the way.

612
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:34,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you?

613
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:35,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I laughed.

614
00:42:36,986 --> 00:43:03,831
[SPEAKER_09]: to continue with the email personally mine are the Bridge Battle and Shining Force Escaping Midgar in Final Fantasy 7 and the aforementioned Wall at the End of the World in Grandia the Shining Force thing probably doesn't seem all that interesting to most people but that was my first RPG at age 6 in 1993 oh I feel old so it's got a special place in my heart speaking of sentimental games it'd also be cool to know what games are particularly special to you and why keep up the great show Mr. D

615
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:20,703
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as games that are special to me, Super Street Fighter 2 on Super Nintendo because it was my very first Super Nintendo game that was mine and not my brother's on my Nintendo system.

616
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:21,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine.

617
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Me.

618
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:24,787
[SPEAKER_09]: It belonged to me.

619
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:27,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Special games...

620
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:31,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

621
00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:35,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of a whole lot that, like, Super Metroid, I suppose, would be one.

622
00:43:36,652 --> 00:43:38,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I think it's the really greatest game ever.

623
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:49,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to, maybe I would go all the way back to the Atari 2600 and say things like Spider-Man, because those are some of my earliest gaming memories right there, so those games are definitely special.

624
00:43:50,140 --> 00:44:00,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I have, you know, sorry, this really makes me feel old, but I remember being, you know, little, like a first grader,

625
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:11,709
[SPEAKER_09]: and going next door to my friend's house and playing their Odyssey 2 and playing... I want to say it was like a Lord of the Rings game or something.

626
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:12,370
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it wasn't.

627
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:17,394
[SPEAKER_09]: You play either as a fighter, a wizard, a changeling, or something else.

628
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And playing... What was that?

629
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:27,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Casey Munchkin's Crazy Chase that got sued for being like Pac-Man, which I actually still have a copy of it.

630
00:44:27,563 --> 00:44:27,823
[SPEAKER_09]: You know...

631
00:44:29,574 --> 00:44:38,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I kind of have good memories of that, but I also have good memories of playing Kix in elementary school.

632
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:43,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what game I used to freaking love that's very special to me.

633
00:44:43,654 --> 00:44:46,418
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an old-ass computer game called Rogue.

634
00:44:47,076 --> 00:44:50,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you ever played this game, but you control a little happy face looking thing.

635
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all done in ASCII graphics, but it was an actual game.

636
00:44:52,778 --> 00:44:54,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like Epyx or somebody put it out.

637
00:44:54,618 --> 00:44:58,979
[SPEAKER_06]: But you play this little ASCII happy face that went around through these tunnels.

638
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:00,940
[SPEAKER_06]: You were exploring, you know, like a dungeon.

639
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,201
[SPEAKER_06]: And creatures were giant capital letters that would, like a B for bat would attack you and all this stuff.

640
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:10,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like quite a number of the old MUDs I used to have.

641
00:45:10,422 --> 00:45:12,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It was old school, but great.

642
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:19,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, also, I have to say, when I was in second or third grade, we had a Clicca Vision.

643
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:25,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, it was always playing Venture and Mousetrap, which I suck at Venture now.

644
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:34,476
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I guess it's like really a lot, because there's certain games that I would be playing at a time that I'd attach to certain things that were going on in my life at the time.

645
00:45:34,976 --> 00:45:37,298
[SPEAKER_09]: And, like, I think it's entirely hilarious.

646
00:45:37,378 --> 00:45:43,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan was trying to, I guess, catalog things that had happened in his life

647
00:45:43,895 --> 00:45:48,936
[SPEAKER_09]: and, um, he was doing a lot of it by sort of what he was playing at that time and what grade he was in.

648
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:57,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that, you know, honestly, that's sort of how I correlate a lot of stuff happens to me too, because I'll remember, oh, this happened, and at the time I was playing this.

649
00:45:58,238 --> 00:46:00,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I have that kind of memory attachment, I guess.

650
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:03,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

651
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:06,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you're awfully quiet.

652
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:07,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot of special video games for you?

653
00:46:08,279 --> 00:46:09,059
[SPEAKER_06]: He's looking at porn.

654
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not looking at porn, I'm looking at news.

655
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Gal's Panic is not a special game to you?

656
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:15,731
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

657
00:46:17,272 --> 00:46:17,592
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

658
00:46:18,572 --> 00:46:19,252
[SPEAKER_06]: No more emails?

659
00:46:20,573 --> 00:46:20,713
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

660
00:46:20,793 --> 00:46:21,133
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it?

661
00:46:21,453 --> 00:46:21,673
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

662
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:23,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we have one particular attachment.

663
00:46:23,934 --> 00:46:25,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, our names are attached to.

664
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:28,455
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR the game.

665
00:46:29,516 --> 00:46:29,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

666
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:30,636
[SPEAKER_09]: The text game.

667
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:31,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, of course.

668
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:33,417
[SPEAKER_06]: The OLR text game.

669
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:34,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Put that on our wiki, people.

670
00:46:35,898 --> 00:46:36,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is it?

671
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:37,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you still get a copy of that?

672
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:38,318
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be available somewhere.

673
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:39,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've got it somewhere.

674
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:40,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhere.

675
00:46:40,993 --> 00:46:45,175
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

676
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,437
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to get to the Skype line very soon.

677
00:46:47,477 --> 00:46:48,918
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some gaming news first.

678
00:46:49,738 --> 00:46:51,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

679
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,203
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a rumor going around that Def Leppard was going to be in Guitar Hero 4.

680
00:46:58,823 --> 00:47:03,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually ended up turning out that wasn't exactly true.

681
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:07,448
[SPEAKER_07]: It was during an interview with the band on the radio show Rock Align.

682
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:12,284
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess Caller asked why none of their songs have been featured in Guitar Hero or Rockman.

683
00:47:12,824 --> 00:47:20,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, their guitarist, Phil Cullen, replied, revealing at least three of their hits would be featured in Guitar Hero 4.

684
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock of Ages, Animal, and, of course, Photograph.

685
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:28,656
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is, though, it actually isn't going to be featured in Guitar Hero 4.

686
00:47:28,736 --> 00:47:29,316
[SPEAKER_07]: He was wrong.

687
00:47:29,476 --> 00:47:33,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually download content that's going to be coming out soon for Guitar Hero 3.

688
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:34,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

689
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:34,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

690
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:40,316
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be Def Leppard songs, just not in Guitar Hero 4, at least not those songs.

691
00:47:40,616 --> 00:47:41,737
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be Def Leppard.

692
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:45,257
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be fun.

693
00:47:45,978 --> 00:47:51,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I was thinking, we just had a story a couple weeks ago that really made us think that arcades were dying.

694
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:56,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we kind of already kind of knew that sadly arcades are dying and they're just not what they used to be.

695
00:47:56,921 --> 00:48:04,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I think we had another story about, didn't we have the story last week about Namco's doing something with the Wii in their arcades or something, trying to like integrate all that stuff?

696
00:48:04,443 --> 00:48:05,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we talked about it last week.

697
00:48:05,963 --> 00:48:24,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess somebody else has faith in arcade games because apparently Signature Devices, they're hardware and software developers, they have sent word out that they are putting final touches on a new four-player arcade game that will, quote, include several well-known comic book and television superheroes.

698
00:48:25,311 --> 00:48:28,172
[SPEAKER_06]: As to who those are, that's still a mystery.

699
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:29,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be anything.

700
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:35,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it could literally be anything from the Marvel DC world all the way to heroes from NBC, although I kind of doubt that.

701
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:57,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's kind of interesting that all hope is not dead yet for arcades and depending on what names are attached to this game because you know well known quote unquote you know that could be Dora the Explorer as a hero to some and I don't know if that's going to be the one that gets people to come back so hopefully it's the right thing we'll hopefully get more information on that in the coming weeks

702
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:02,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how about some other news then?

703
00:49:03,362 --> 00:49:03,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

704
00:49:04,002 --> 00:49:04,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom!

705
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:06,924
[SPEAKER_09]: As in Capcom's Gamers Day.

706
00:49:08,664 --> 00:49:11,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're letting people who are not the press go.

707
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:14,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Except they're only letting five of them go.

708
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:22,190
[SPEAKER_09]: So, basically, five lucky people are going to be able to get in and they're actually calling it Captivate 08.

709
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:26,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is, I guess, kind of an interesting name.

710
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:28,293
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

711
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:32,092
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're lucky, you get to get in and play with everybody else.

712
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:40,715
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, basically, um, I don't really see, though, anything on here about how it actually is accomplished.

713
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:42,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you have to write them, basically.

714
00:49:42,716 --> 00:49:46,878
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little thingy, email them, saying why you think you should be able to go.

715
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:49,178
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they pick a winner out of that.

716
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, there's actually a link on there afterwards that you basically said it, so there you go.

717
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:56,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Beg!

718
00:49:56,901 --> 00:49:58,362
[SPEAKER_07]: That still sucks, though.

719
00:49:58,968 --> 00:50:00,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Get one and sell it on eBay.

720
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:01,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you should enter the contest.

721
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't tell them you do this show.

722
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:08,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tell them, you know, oh, I grew up on Mega Man and I love Capcom and Street Fighter is so memorable to me.

723
00:50:09,014 --> 00:50:10,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Write something really cheesy and maybe they'll pick you.

724
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:12,076
[SPEAKER_06]: They get to go anyway.

725
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:15,257
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a cool lie to them like that.

726
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:17,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not lying.

727
00:50:17,479 --> 00:50:23,142
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you've got to say that you're part of an independent podcast and that they don't give the little guy a fair shake and then you make them feel bad.

728
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:31,361
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they don't care, then you say, well, fuck, your Mega Man games lately have sucked, so what do I care?

729
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:36,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say you enter it and then you lose because they say, oh, well, you know, you're a podcaster.

730
00:50:37,322 --> 00:50:43,163
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, then that's a double standard because then they're saying, oh, but podcasters and people like that aren't supposed to come to this.

731
00:50:43,403 --> 00:50:44,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So make up your mind.

732
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:45,824
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make any sense, though.

733
00:50:45,884 --> 00:50:49,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Podcasters and people in the media aren't supposed to come to their media event?

734
00:50:49,344 --> 00:50:50,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that sucks.

735
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:51,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

736
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:53,905
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not, you know, IGN or anything, so that's fine.

737
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:55,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

738
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to play Mega Man.

739
00:50:57,271 --> 00:51:01,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Star Force, Zerker X, you know, Sauron or Ninja?

740
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:04,554
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll all be on YouTube the day after anyway.

741
00:51:04,614 --> 00:51:05,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't care.

742
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:08,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just bitter like that.

743
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:09,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know.

744
00:51:09,496 --> 00:51:12,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the Gamer Day events we have gone to in the past have been kind of fun.

745
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:13,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, all two of them.

746
00:51:13,778 --> 00:51:15,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It is kind of thrilling to be there, you know.

747
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:19,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Konami was the only ones that invited us and then they moved away.

748
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,061
[SPEAKER_08]: So, oh, bye-bye.

749
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:22,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

750
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:23,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

751
00:51:24,352 --> 00:51:26,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, there's a game out there.

752
00:51:27,073 --> 00:51:28,313
[SPEAKER_07]: This is free to play, too.

753
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,574
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to go to some stupid gamer's day to play it.

754
00:51:31,474 --> 00:51:32,995
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game called Tetroid 2012.

755
00:51:34,455 --> 00:51:38,696
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a mashup of Tetris and Arkanoid.

756
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:44,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I think a little bit like Silent Hills, especially if you listen to some of the soundtrack for it.

757
00:51:44,238 --> 00:51:45,458
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really trippy.

758
00:51:45,818 --> 00:51:46,939
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's free to download.

759
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:50,400
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually available on... Let's see here.

760
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Come over to the website.

761
00:51:52,828 --> 00:51:55,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a 111 meg download too, if I remember correctly.

762
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:57,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of music and sound effects in there.

763
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:05,091
[SPEAKER_07]: But the website to go check it out, it's entity.be slash entity.

764
00:52:05,752 --> 00:52:08,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's some links to the games that they make.

765
00:52:08,532 --> 00:52:13,414
[SPEAKER_07]: They made, of course, this game and then, I guess, a remake of Tempest.

766
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:16,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're a fan of Tempest, you can check that out as well.

767
00:52:16,555 --> 00:52:17,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I heart Tempest.

768
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:18,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to check that.

769
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:19,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it go Super Zapper Recharge?

770
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but it's very trippy looking.

771
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:27,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Before this, though, from what I remember, I guess that they used to do, like, demo scene stuff.

772
00:52:27,513 --> 00:52:31,255
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, all the, like, encoding graphic little demos and stuff like that.

773
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:34,237
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is a very trippy-looking game.

774
00:52:35,258 --> 00:52:40,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking at that Tetroid 2012 a little bit ago, and it definitely looks interesting.

775
00:52:41,002 --> 00:52:49,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you charge up with, like, a little special meter, and then when you hit the special button, it flips the whole screen upside down, and then you turn into, like, you know, Arkanoid mode or whatever.

776
00:52:49,868 --> 00:52:51,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to admit, that's kind of neat.

777
00:52:52,426 --> 00:52:56,279
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we'll check that out a little later.

778
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:57,904
[SPEAKER_06]: At least maybe I'll download that and check it out.

779
00:52:58,662 --> 00:52:59,103
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

780
00:53:24,245 --> 00:53:27,426
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be Link and you're in the Super Mario Bros.

781
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:29,887
[SPEAKER_06]: world and you're trying to stab at asteroids.

782
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,368
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all of a sudden you're Pac-Man and you're in Arkanoid.

783
00:53:34,268 --> 00:53:36,389
[SPEAKER_07]: It randomly changes your characters too.

784
00:53:36,509 --> 00:53:42,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes you will have the really crappy Space Invaders ship and stuff like that.

785
00:53:44,511 --> 00:53:50,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them can only shoot in one direction and you have to basically play them like their respective games.

786
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:51,231
[SPEAKER_06]: IndieGames.com

787
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,851
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the best name ever, Funk Monkey.

788
00:54:34,465 --> 00:54:41,226
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I made Polychromatic Funk Monkey a tile-based platforming game about building maps for tile-based platforming games.

789
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:52,228
[SPEAKER_06]: In Polychromatic Funk Monkey, the eponymous monkey of funk brings order and rhythm to his chaotic land arranging the blocks he finds into towering staircases and bridges in the sky.

790
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:55,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a riot.

791
00:54:55,169 --> 00:54:56,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's another game called Fishy Fishy.

792
00:54:59,649 --> 00:55:01,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this might be one of my new favorite developers.

793
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:03,150
[SPEAKER_09]: That's

794
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:04,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful.

795
00:55:04,607 --> 00:55:05,628
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get them on the show.

796
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:07,609
[SPEAKER_06]: You should.

797
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I will send an email this week and see what we can do.

798
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:11,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

799
00:55:12,573 --> 00:55:20,498
[SPEAKER_06]: But he'll have to wait because I'm not doing anything special for Life365, so maybe we can have him on our debut all games episode.

800
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:24,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say, though, I watched someone play through a whole game of Romchek fail.

801
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:27,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I was cracking up the entire time.

802
00:55:27,622 --> 00:55:28,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Romchek win.

803
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:30,064
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

804
00:55:30,284 --> 00:55:31,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Win for reals.

805
00:55:32,306 --> 00:55:32,926
[SPEAKER_09]: So guess what?

806
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:34,727
[SPEAKER_09]: We have more news.

807
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:35,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

808
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:39,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Paramount is going to be getting into games.

809
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:47,412
[SPEAKER_09]: They are going to be doing mobile, handheld, casual games because they make money.

810
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:54,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of them are talking about tie-ins between their movie franchises and these games.

811
00:55:55,236 --> 00:55:57,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So hey, that'd be cool.

812
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:00,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the other thing I bet happened.

813
00:56:00,143 --> 00:56:10,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Paramount realized, writer's strike, loss of money, people aren't going to the movies like they used to, video games, money machine.

814
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:12,151
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you do?

815
00:56:12,211 --> 00:56:19,857
[SPEAKER_07]: They also may have realized, hey, Sony, Warner, Vividi, they're all in games as well.

816
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:20,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Vivendi?

817
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:21,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Vivendi.

818
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:22,198
[SPEAKER_07]: You said Vinvidi.

819
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:23,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

820
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Fusion of Vivendi and Invidia.

821
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:27,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Vinvidia.

822
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:29,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Vivendi, whatever.

823
00:56:30,263 --> 00:56:32,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and Disney or Buena Vista.

824
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:34,486
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all in games.

825
00:56:34,927 --> 00:56:37,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So, why not them?

826
00:56:37,969 --> 00:56:38,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray!

827
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:48,878
[SPEAKER_07]: One game that they're not making, but you can get for dirt cheap, at least this week in Steam, has been offering Prey for $4.95.

828
00:56:49,098 --> 00:56:51,240
[SPEAKER_07]: This week and only.

829
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So, apparently if you listen to this on podcast, you've missed out.

830
00:56:54,323 --> 00:56:55,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you bought this already.

831
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:56,004
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh,

832
00:56:57,128 --> 00:57:00,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it now, because you only have a few hours left before this deal is up.

833
00:57:02,213 --> 00:57:18,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And Pray, for those who may not remember, was a 3D Realms game, not Duke Nukem Forever, and involved you, a Native American, to be basically abducted onto a ship where there's a bunch of weird, crazy shit, and you can never die.

834
00:57:20,011 --> 00:57:23,654
[SPEAKER_06]: We can die in the very early levels if you're not good at first-person shooters.

835
00:57:23,734 --> 00:57:26,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I died once in the early levels because I'm horrible at first-person shooters.

836
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:28,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it on the Xbox 360.

837
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not bad, and it has a beautiful soundtrack.

838
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,061
[SPEAKER_06]: It has an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack.

839
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:36,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from the guy who did Oblivion and Guild Wars and all that, so you know the music's good.

840
00:57:36,965 --> 00:57:39,347
[SPEAKER_06]: The game itself, kind of a little short.

841
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:44,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember it kind of just ended suddenly, but definitely made way for a sequel.

842
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:45,992
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

843
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,840
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

844
00:58:15,549 --> 00:58:16,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So give us a call.

845
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,750
[SPEAKER_06]: We're already getting a call.

846
00:58:18,431 --> 00:58:19,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

847
00:58:19,611 --> 00:58:19,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

848
00:58:24,174 --> 00:58:25,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

849
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:25,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

850
00:58:28,656 --> 00:58:31,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're just a little quiet, but maybe that's our studio mic.

851
00:58:31,157 --> 00:58:32,078
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, Zaku?

852
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing much.

853
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:43,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Just trying to... Just trying to go through, you know... It kind of sucks that you have to ditch Live 365, you know...

854
00:58:43,547 --> 00:58:45,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it kind of sucks they had to double their rates.

855
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:46,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, you are really quiet.

856
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:47,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you get closer to your microphone?

857
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:48,552
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just us.

858
00:58:48,852 --> 00:58:50,273
[SPEAKER_06]: You're coming through really quiet on the thing.

859
00:58:51,234 --> 00:58:51,835
Perfect, there you go.

860
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:55,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, much better.

861
00:58:55,538 --> 00:58:56,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Much better.

862
00:58:56,198 --> 00:58:57,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what's on your mind?

863
00:58:57,299 --> 00:58:58,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sucks we have to leave Life 365.

864
00:59:00,622 --> 00:59:10,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see, I was going to get Rainbow Six Vegas, but what I read is that Ubisoft's not doing their job and trying to get the shit out of it.

865
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:15,975
[SPEAKER_02]: all the bugs on the PS3 and 360 that are making me jittery.

866
00:59:16,796 --> 00:59:20,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just making me nervous right now before I even buy the damn thing.

867
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:24,582
[SPEAKER_06]: You said it was Rainbow Six Vegas 2?

868
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:26,223
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, yeah.

869
00:59:26,523 --> 00:59:27,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you played Rainbow Six Vegas 2?

870
00:59:28,345 --> 00:59:29,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like the Tom Clancy games.

871
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:33,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some folks on my Xbox Live list though that have been playing nothing but that lately.

872
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:40,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're lucky enough to do the crap that the current bugs that haven't been fixed yet

873
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you actually buy the game or were you just worried about it?

874
00:59:48,102 --> 00:59:48,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

875
00:59:48,362 --> 00:59:50,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I just read it on Kotaku, that's the thing.

876
00:59:51,223 --> 01:00:01,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I just read it from other folks that the PS3 version of the servers were basically just getting really flaky and just not connecting through games.

877
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:06,132
[SPEAKER_02]: The 360 version was about the same with very noticeable glitches and whatnot.

878
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm waiting right now, so I'm getting paid tomorrow.

879
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:18,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, if there's a patch coming out very soon, that's all I need for me to actually go down to GameStop and buy the game.

880
01:00:20,694 --> 01:00:30,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, is there anybody in chat at our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, that maybe has some suggestions on this game?

881
01:00:30,198 --> 01:00:33,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, is it worth buying it now, or should you wait for a patch, or what?

882
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:39,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, yeah, Loki doesn't play those games, I don't think Jamie's played it, and I have not played it, so I'm kind of curious if anyone in our chat...

883
01:00:40,348 --> 01:00:41,649
[SPEAKER_06]: has anything to say about it.

884
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:43,009
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

885
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:46,570
[SPEAKER_06]: It's part of the beauty of doing this live with the chat room.

886
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,971
[SPEAKER_06]: When we are not familiar with it, hopefully somebody else is.

887
01:00:49,392 --> 01:00:51,532
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is on your mind, Zaku, while we wait for some comments?

888
01:00:53,253 --> 01:01:05,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I don't like to bring up Bomani that much, but EMUs, by now you've probably heard it's already rolling out on somewhat of a national level, although it's in one arcade.

889
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:07,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we covered the one arcade a couple weeks ago.

890
01:01:07,578 --> 01:01:08,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Has it rolled out to more yet?

891
01:01:10,457 --> 01:01:25,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no unlocks so far, so I'm not sure whether, you know, at this rate if we're trying to catch up to Japan in terms of unlocking the games, by the time they're done, we'll be done in like, what, October, November, at that rate?

892
01:01:26,218 --> 01:01:30,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they've only got one arcade working on it.

893
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:31,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we got a response about Vegas 2.

894
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:41,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross2UT says, Well, I got my version of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 exchanged for the 360, and it's fine, aside from the odd frame rate drop, which never becomes unplayable.

895
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:46,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Online co-op is absolutely amazing, especially as you actually go through the story this time.

896
01:01:47,632 --> 01:01:48,073
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it.

897
01:01:49,794 --> 01:01:50,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

898
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a fairly favorable review.

899
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:53,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

900
01:01:54,117 --> 01:01:54,417
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

901
01:01:55,037 --> 01:01:57,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Zaku, anything else before we let you go and take some more calls?

902
01:01:58,441 --> 01:02:05,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Any plans on finding a good replacement for Live 365 that won't involve paying royalties up the ass?

903
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:14,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, listen to Part A. We are going to be merging with AllGames.com and doing our show live on their feed, and you won't have to register or any of that stuff anymore.

904
01:02:14,678 --> 01:02:15,219
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be great.

905
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:21,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in terms of the radio station, that's done for good, right?

906
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:26,674
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as the 24-hour day, 7-day-a-week feed, yes.

907
01:02:27,515 --> 01:02:29,576
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to be operating it on Life 35 anymore.

908
01:02:30,176 --> 01:02:35,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, we're going to be trying to come together with other independent podcasters to create a Voltron network.

909
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really now?

910
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:37,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really.

911
01:02:38,061 --> 01:02:40,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you still be able to play the music eventually?

912
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:42,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing is changing on our show.

913
01:02:42,956 --> 01:02:44,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is staying the same.

914
01:02:44,457 --> 01:02:44,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

915
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to be kept in the loop just like everyone else.

916
01:02:52,325 --> 01:02:56,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got in right now, just playing my 360 up until like an hour ago.

917
01:02:56,749 --> 01:02:57,529
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

918
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, check out part A when it goes up later tonight.

919
01:02:59,852 --> 01:03:00,572
[SPEAKER_06]: How's all the details?

920
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:00,893
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty?

921
01:03:01,753 --> 01:03:02,054
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

922
01:03:02,174 --> 01:03:02,354
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

923
01:03:02,394 --> 01:03:02,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

924
01:03:03,515 --> 01:03:03,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

925
01:03:04,296 --> 01:03:04,576
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

926
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:10,074
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

927
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:10,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take another call.

928
01:03:12,075 --> 01:03:13,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

929
01:03:13,216 --> 01:03:13,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

930
01:03:15,137 --> 01:03:15,857
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68.

931
01:03:16,057 --> 01:03:17,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, GS68.

932
01:03:17,078 --> 01:03:17,878
[SPEAKER_06]: What is on your mind?

933
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:24,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been reading the comments for this one story and thinking about how PC gaming is dying.

934
01:03:25,123 --> 01:03:33,648
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of comments saying about how PC gaming is not dead and how PC gaming is inferior to consoles and crap.

935
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:33,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean...

936
01:03:35,185 --> 01:03:39,771
[SPEAKER_00]: They got me wondering, I mean, aside from the games, what do consoles have on PCs?

937
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:51,907
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and then, like, there's some people talking about how, like, keyboard and mouse, like, goes great with, like, how, like, there should be keyboard and mouse support for every PS3 game, among other things.

938
01:03:54,734 --> 01:03:55,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

939
01:03:55,575 --> 01:03:59,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's a lot of truth to that whole PC gaming is dying.

940
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:04,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's that when a game comes out on the PC and the console, the console tends to do a little better.

941
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:05,238
[SPEAKER_06]: But come on.

942
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,578
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm focusing on.

943
01:04:06,818 --> 01:04:08,599
[SPEAKER_06]: But look at a game like World of Warcraft.

944
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:09,459
[SPEAKER_06]: That's huge.

945
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,740
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

946
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,980
[SPEAKER_06]: That's only on the PC.

947
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:15,541
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to hear... I'm not exactly talking about PC games dying.

948
01:04:15,682 --> 01:04:22,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking about a lot of people saying how PC gaming is superior to console gaming and...

949
01:04:24,045 --> 01:04:37,597
[SPEAKER_00]: How PC can do everything for your homework or browsing the internet and you don't have to buy $500 consoles every few years, just upgraded PCs.

950
01:04:38,298 --> 01:04:43,262
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, what do consoles have on PCs besides the games on them?

951
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:45,670
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

952
01:04:59,076 --> 01:05:01,538
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

953
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:31,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Those that remember when the Commodore 64 was out in this country and it did very well in Europe as well.

954
01:05:31,777 --> 01:05:39,905
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one reason the Commodore 64 did so great is because not only did the Commodore 64 have a monitor it would hook up to, but it also would hook up to your TV.

955
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:44,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a pretty big deal to have a home computer that actually was on your TV as well.

956
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:48,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there really is just that convenience of having it in your living room.

957
01:05:49,952 --> 01:06:03,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even games that normally go on consoles, like 2D platformers and scrolling shooters, I mean, there are... I mean, there are, like, free games that they can download on their PC.

958
01:06:04,016 --> 01:06:08,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, look at Cave Story and, just for Dark Tetsuya, La Milana.

959
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:12,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are great platforms, but they're not on consoles.

960
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:16,120
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're for the PC, and they're free.

961
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:16,480
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean...

962
01:06:19,317 --> 01:06:24,300
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't name any free console games or free indie console games.

963
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you one, and I hate to say it, but Yaris.

964
01:06:28,762 --> 01:06:32,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was also Aegis Wing and a few of those.

965
01:06:32,744 --> 01:06:36,606
[SPEAKER_06]: A very, very few handful available on Xbox Live.

966
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:37,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see more.

967
01:06:38,608 --> 01:06:45,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see a subscription-based available service or some more free perks on the consoles here and there, but

968
01:06:45,595 --> 01:06:46,135
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

969
01:07:10,755 --> 01:07:19,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very easy in comparison to just fire up a coding program and a C++ compiler or whatever language you want to program in and make your game.

970
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:20,041
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

971
01:07:23,783 --> 01:07:31,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's kind of the difference is that it's more accessible to make stuff indie-wise on the PC than it is for consoles who have a very closed authoring format.

972
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:37,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well GS68, do you have anything else you want to share or ask us tonight?

973
01:07:38,582 --> 01:07:39,022
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura

974
01:08:04,215 --> 01:08:04,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the ferret.

975
01:08:05,436 --> 01:08:05,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you do.

976
01:08:06,397 --> 01:08:07,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's on camera.

977
01:08:08,178 --> 01:08:08,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad it's not on the camera.

978
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:10,760
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my ferret headgear.

979
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:13,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I wear the ferret on my head for a little bit on the cam?

980
01:08:13,642 --> 01:08:15,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if Justin TV is working right now.

981
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been very terrible at checking that chat tonight.

982
01:08:18,947 --> 01:08:19,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

983
01:08:19,947 --> 01:08:20,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

984
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Sessions.

985
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hello, DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Sessions.

986
01:08:26,693 --> 01:08:27,013
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

987
01:08:28,072 --> 01:08:33,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much, and that was me that told you that we were doing a live feed of OLR from Anime Boston.

988
01:08:33,934 --> 01:08:34,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it happen?

989
01:08:34,574 --> 01:08:35,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it actually happen?

990
01:08:36,415 --> 01:08:37,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Partially.

991
01:08:37,095 --> 01:08:41,797
[SPEAKER_04]: When we got there, we started setting up, I started the feed, and I'm like, okay, where's the power?

992
01:08:43,004 --> 01:08:43,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the power?

993
01:08:44,345 --> 01:08:46,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I see other dealers, other vendors with power.

994
01:08:47,047 --> 01:08:47,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay.

995
01:08:47,888 --> 01:08:54,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I go over to the convention head, center head to get power.

996
01:08:54,152 --> 01:08:56,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 119 for the full weekend.

997
01:08:56,534 --> 01:08:59,917
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're like – This is a long no answer, isn't it?

998
01:09:00,697 --> 01:09:01,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like, no.

999
01:09:02,178 --> 01:09:07,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ended up having the feed a little bit on Friday and for about a couple of hours on Sunday.

1000
01:09:08,423 --> 01:09:10,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you here for the announcement?

1001
01:09:10,365 --> 01:09:12,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was a heck of a show to be listening to.

1002
01:09:13,831 --> 01:09:20,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I was having a WrestleMania 24 party, but I did hear the announcement about where OLR is heading off to.

1003
01:09:20,576 --> 01:09:24,439
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, I actually know somebody that probably would have kept you guys going for 24-7.

1004
01:09:37,624 --> 01:09:38,225
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

1005
01:09:38,645 --> 01:09:44,406
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a lot of great offers along those types of lines, but we're excited about the powers of Voltron.

1006
01:09:45,267 --> 01:09:47,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see what happens.

1007
01:09:47,707 --> 01:09:48,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be exciting.

1008
01:09:49,128 --> 01:09:50,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what else is on your mind, Ranma?

1009
01:09:51,328 --> 01:09:51,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much.

1010
01:09:51,789 --> 01:10:00,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to basically give you guys a basic con rap of anime Boston, and believe it or not, you want to know what most popular items in the dealer's room was?

1011
01:10:01,871 --> 01:10:03,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy VII related material.

1012
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:04,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1013
01:10:04,974 --> 01:10:09,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Goji is always the number two item sold at dealers rooms.

1014
01:10:10,357 --> 01:10:10,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Dolphins.

1015
01:10:12,178 --> 01:10:12,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1016
01:10:12,759 --> 01:10:13,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet there were some though.

1017
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I did see a couple.

1018
01:10:16,901 --> 01:10:17,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, what?

1019
01:10:17,461 --> 01:10:17,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I give up.

1020
01:10:18,862 --> 01:10:20,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo merchandise.

1021
01:10:20,503 --> 01:10:28,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost every single vendor had all kinds of Super Mario Brothers or standard Nintendo merchandise that was selling like hotcakes.

1022
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:29,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, was WYSIWYG there?

1023
01:10:30,316 --> 01:10:30,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they were.

1024
01:10:31,316 --> 01:10:36,218
[SPEAKER_09]: They are the big culprits for the Nintendo goods, plus they sell Pocky.

1025
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:40,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they weren't selling Pocky at this con, though.

1026
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:40,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad!

1027
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:47,963
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't, because when your convention is in a convention center, according to the contract, you're not allowed to sell food.

1028
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that sucks, because I bought every burger at Faname last year.

1029
01:10:53,263 --> 01:10:54,604
[SPEAKER_09]: is that that candy hamburger stuff?

1030
01:10:54,644 --> 01:11:14,394
[SPEAKER_04]: yes the candy hamburger I love that stuff that stuff is really good well that stuff is fine but you got people you can't sell like Pocky or Ramenade and stuff like that that you can't sell lame yeah yeah I know I know it's kind of crazy though but me and my crew we're trying to figure out like a way around that well good luck to you how was the con?

1031
01:11:14,414 --> 01:11:15,455
[SPEAKER_06]: otherwise good times?

1032
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,401
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

1033
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:23,005
[SPEAKER_04]: The number one problem was the long, long, long, long.

1034
01:11:23,085 --> 01:11:25,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I mention long lines for registration?

1035
01:11:26,488 --> 01:11:27,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, of course.

1036
01:11:27,369 --> 01:11:30,511
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems to be the problem with a lot of anime cons is long registration lines.

1037
01:11:31,172 --> 01:11:35,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but at most cons, it's like you wait no more than an hour to get your badge.

1038
01:11:35,795 --> 01:11:39,718
[SPEAKER_04]: There were people that were waiting anywhere between 5 and 11 hours for their badges.

1039
01:11:40,519 --> 01:11:42,040
[SPEAKER_06]: 11 hours to get a badge?

1040
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm not kidding.

1041
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:44,502
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to be fucking kidding me.

1042
01:11:44,762 --> 01:11:45,323
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.

1043
01:11:45,363 --> 01:11:45,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1044
01:11:47,042 --> 01:11:47,782
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy talk.

1045
01:11:48,583 --> 01:11:51,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they printed them out on these machines and the machines broke.

1046
01:11:51,363 --> 01:11:55,185
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only four people on registration and the lines were going forever.

1047
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:56,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesson learned.

1048
01:11:57,966 --> 01:11:59,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone posted a link.

1049
01:11:59,046 --> 01:12:02,487
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a parody of Still Alive to Still in Line.

1050
01:12:03,267 --> 01:12:03,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1051
01:12:04,388 --> 01:12:13,631
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, and I've been suggesting this for a while now, for conventions they should take the old E3 approach and mail your pass.

1052
01:12:14,818 --> 01:12:16,499
[SPEAKER_04]: or just don't make fancy fucking badges

1053
01:12:37,796 --> 01:12:38,256
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1054
01:12:57,817 --> 01:13:00,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Bulk rate, I guess, would be available for business.

1055
01:13:00,759 --> 01:13:07,964
[SPEAKER_09]: But have them print it out and, you know, you pay like X amount extra to have, you know, your badge mailed to you.

1056
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:10,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's a good thing.

1057
01:13:10,585 --> 01:13:15,108
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I actually know a couple of people that are like reg, throwing heads at worked reg.

1058
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:17,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And they say it just doesn't work that way.

1059
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:18,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't work out.

1060
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,251
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't be all that cost effective.

1061
01:13:20,952 --> 01:13:23,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's the paying a little extra.

1062
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:24,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1063
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:34,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that was the only method that someone wants to avoid the long line, then just say, well, I will pay another $5 for postage and you can mail it to me.

1064
01:13:35,835 --> 01:13:42,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what some cons are doing now, they're offering like two-year badges, three-year badges, lifetime badges, and pre-con night.

1065
01:13:43,138 --> 01:13:53,583
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is, not everybody's going to come up Thursday night for a convention, so to give that option, and a lot of people still do it, but the difference is you show up Thursday, you get your badge under 15 minutes tops.

1066
01:13:54,204 --> 01:14:01,732
[SPEAKER_09]: AX did the day before thing, and it was just as much of a, pardon the expression, clusterfuck as it is doing day of.

1067
01:14:03,293 --> 01:14:03,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1068
01:14:03,754 --> 01:14:07,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, if you're not there by 10 a.m., you're basically SOL.

1069
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:10,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we've got to wrap up, Ranma.

1070
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:16,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely some lessons learned for anybody thinking about throwing on a convention in the near future, but any last-minute thoughts for our folks?

1071
01:14:17,068 --> 01:14:20,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Three links I posted in the chat room, pictures from my website.

1072
01:14:20,851 --> 01:14:26,174
[SPEAKER_04]: One picture is a cart, a facial looking like World 1-1 from Super Mario Brothers.

1073
01:14:26,494 --> 01:14:29,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last two pictures is the old man from The Legend of Zelda.

1074
01:14:31,337 --> 01:14:35,720
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one says, it's dangerous to go alone, take this.

1075
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:40,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second one says, Dodongo dislikes smoke.

1076
01:14:44,116 --> 01:14:45,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured you'd get a kick out of that.

1077
01:14:45,697 --> 01:14:46,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm looking at the picture.

1078
01:14:46,897 --> 01:14:47,598
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

1079
01:14:48,798 --> 01:14:50,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is horrible radio.

1080
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,802
[SPEAKER_06]: But there actually is somebody dressed up holding a big old poster board that says it's dangerous to go alone.

1081
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:55,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Take this.

1082
01:14:55,682 --> 01:14:56,562
[SPEAKER_06]: But where's the sword?

1083
01:14:56,923 --> 01:14:57,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

1084
01:14:57,963 --> 01:15:00,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the cannon.

1085
01:15:00,745 --> 01:15:05,727
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to DJRanmas.net and click on Gallery, you'll see all the pictures from Anime Boston 08.

1086
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:07,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 320 shots I took.

1087
01:15:08,168 --> 01:15:08,509
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1088
01:15:08,689 --> 01:15:09,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like fun.

1089
01:15:09,789 --> 01:15:10,810
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.

1090
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:11,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Take more calls.

1091
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:11,690
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1092
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:12,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, guys.

1093
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:13,211
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1094
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:16,532
[SPEAKER_06]: One more call and we're going to call it a night.

1095
01:15:16,552 --> 01:15:17,272
[SPEAKER_06]: 877-GAME-OLR.

1096
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:19,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1097
01:15:21,053 --> 01:15:23,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And while we wait for a call, Loki, any quick last minute stories?

1098
01:15:23,934 --> 01:15:26,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been gathering stories this entire time.

1099
01:15:26,975 --> 01:15:27,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we got one more.

1100
01:15:29,796 --> 01:15:30,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I love cutting you off.

1101
01:15:31,117 --> 01:15:32,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1102
01:15:32,177 --> 01:15:32,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1103
01:15:33,678 --> 01:15:34,498
[SPEAKER_03]: The ferret's going to go.

1104
01:15:37,813 --> 01:15:39,034
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1105
01:16:07,665 --> 01:16:08,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing much.

1106
01:16:08,626 --> 01:16:11,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been hanging out in your chat room trying to calm everybody's fears.

1107
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:16,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, about like, OMG, we're going to have to suddenly change everything we're doing.

1108
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:20,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm kind of like, have you ever listened to the other shows on allgames.com?

1109
01:16:20,616 --> 01:16:21,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't worry about it.

1110
01:16:23,338 --> 01:16:27,942
[SPEAKER_06]: What would we have to change other than maybe I'll have to bring on a soundboard?

1111
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:29,464
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

1112
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll have to get rid of the ferret.

1113
01:16:31,525 --> 01:16:33,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And the ferret.

1114
01:16:34,246 --> 01:16:44,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to put a big picture on our, big thing on our site, you know, saying, hey, you know, Orange Signs Radio is coming in, we're going to get, like, Tingle, and we're going to Photoshop Loki's head on it, and that's going to be your new logo.

1115
01:16:44,872 --> 01:16:46,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be awesome.

1116
01:16:46,313 --> 01:16:46,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1117
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:47,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't wait.

1118
01:16:48,414 --> 01:16:51,456
[SPEAKER_06]: See, these are all the type of editorial decisions that are being made for us now.

1119
01:16:51,476 --> 01:16:52,737
[SPEAKER_07]: That's as close as you'll ever get.

1120
01:16:55,298 --> 01:16:56,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go buy Eye of Judgment again.

1121
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Neil.

1122
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:00,601
[SPEAKER_06]: How many copies are we up to?

1123
01:17:00,642 --> 01:17:02,703
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't had an update in a long time.

1124
01:17:02,723 --> 01:17:02,923
[SPEAKER_03]: That's...

1125
01:17:04,272 --> 01:17:05,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I want you to look it up.

1126
01:17:05,493 --> 01:17:06,934
[SPEAKER_06]: The listeners demand to know this.

1127
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:08,735
[SPEAKER_06]: What's new in your gaming world, Bobby?

1128
01:17:08,755 --> 01:17:10,656
[SPEAKER_06]: What types of stuff have you been playing lately and enjoying?

1129
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:16,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe it or not, recently I've picked up, I got an old retro Japanese RPG kick.

1130
01:17:17,441 --> 01:17:19,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently started playing the original Suikoden again.

1131
01:17:20,383 --> 01:17:20,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1132
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:26,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was mainly because somebody wrote me on my PS3 saying, why don't you ever play games on your PS3?

1133
01:17:26,526 --> 01:17:27,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm playing Suikoden.

1134
01:17:28,488 --> 01:17:29,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're playing a PS1 game on your PS3, nice.

1135
01:17:30,816 --> 01:17:31,517
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1136
01:17:47,102 --> 01:17:48,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Leading the All Games Radio team.

1137
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:50,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I stopped running that app a long time ago.

1138
01:17:50,323 --> 01:17:56,325
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I get a PlayStation 3, Bobby, we will work together, this Voltron of podcasts, to cure cancer.

1139
01:17:56,345 --> 01:17:57,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Because only Voltron can cure cancer.

1140
01:17:57,646 --> 01:17:58,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's where we're at right now.

1141
01:17:58,886 --> 01:18:01,407
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still at .18 million.

1142
01:18:01,827 --> 01:18:05,368
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problem is it's not tracking the UK sales.

1143
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:09,730
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can guarantee that they're not any more than the US sales.

1144
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:14,371
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if the number were doubled, you would still not be to where you need to be.

1145
01:18:15,952 --> 01:18:16,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Very sad to hear that.

1146
01:18:18,549 --> 01:18:19,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Never going to happen.

1147
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:20,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sad to hear that.

1148
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:30,532
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they only sold, was it week 10, which I guess was last week, they sold 8,627 units in the U.S.

1149
01:18:31,433 --> 01:18:33,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Now how about copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever?

1150
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:35,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even think that's on here.

1151
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:37,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're even tracking that one.

1152
01:18:39,735 --> 01:18:40,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get back to you on that.

1153
01:18:41,015 --> 01:18:42,095
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, please do.

1154
01:18:42,295 --> 01:18:44,416
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not tracking it because it's just too many.

1155
01:18:45,933 --> 01:18:47,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's right.

1156
01:18:47,914 --> 01:18:48,874
[SPEAKER_06]: It blew sales through the roof.

1157
01:18:49,274 --> 01:19:01,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, any other things that our listeners ought to know about this whole all games transition or anything they should know about allgames.com and why it's the place for OLR?

1158
01:19:02,757 --> 01:19:11,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for one, no more ads if you try to listen to the live stream and no more funky players that you have to click through things to get to it.

1159
01:19:11,098 --> 01:19:13,639
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to allgames.com or you go to allgamesradio.com

1160
01:19:14,562 --> 01:19:14,982
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

1161
01:19:37,812 --> 01:19:38,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be very easy.

1162
01:19:38,753 --> 01:19:41,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a higher quality, no more MP3 Pro.

1163
01:19:42,296 --> 01:19:47,460
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't plan to have you guys change anything music-wise or anything.

1164
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know a lot of people are like, well, what about the music and stuff?

1165
01:19:51,624 --> 01:20:01,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob, you know that I'm willing to talk to you about that and maybe even doing a music block from your library or even just merging your library of music into ours during the 24-7 stream.

1166
01:20:02,705 --> 01:20:04,626
[SPEAKER_03]: and bring in some of your other talk programs over.

1167
01:20:04,727 --> 01:20:08,269
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not keeping this only to the Sunday night thing.

1168
01:20:08,609 --> 01:20:09,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1169
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:18,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's part of, you know, why it was a good idea is that, you know, it's not just, you know, that All Games is sucking this show up and tearing it away from what we had.

1170
01:20:18,456 --> 01:20:20,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it is kind of like a, you know...

1171
01:20:21,227 --> 01:20:34,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one way when we were kind of talking about it was that it's now the resources of the three of us that make this show happen and some of the other people behind OLR are now troops in the allgames.com universe and can work towards building good ideas there.

1172
01:20:34,659 --> 01:20:40,564
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's going to be great because I know everybody over there has got ideas and Lord knows we have ideas of our own.

1173
01:20:40,664 --> 01:20:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to keep going from there.

1174
01:20:42,345 --> 01:20:42,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be great.

1175
01:20:43,703 --> 01:20:44,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new chapter.

1176
01:20:45,044 --> 01:20:48,627
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll send the camera crew up there for Loki and the Tingle outfit and everything.

1177
01:20:48,867 --> 01:20:49,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, awesome.

1178
01:20:49,688 --> 01:20:49,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1179
01:20:50,008 --> 01:20:50,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't wait.

1180
01:20:50,949 --> 01:20:53,811
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be awesome whenever that sells a million copies.

1181
01:20:54,872 --> 01:20:55,632
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be at PAX.

1182
01:20:58,374 --> 01:21:01,357
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say this, you know, because I know you're thinking about coming up to PAX.

1183
01:21:01,397 --> 01:21:03,779
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually trying to do something really big at PAX.

1184
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:04,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

1185
01:21:04,339 --> 01:21:05,540
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of live streaming.

1186
01:21:06,521 --> 01:21:07,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going up there.

1187
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:08,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Kropotkin and Hendrix are actually coming out there.

1188
01:21:08,802 --> 01:21:10,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Kropotkin's coming out from the UK.

1189
01:21:10,384 --> 01:21:11,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that is big.

1190
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:11,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Flying to PAX.

1191
01:21:12,683 --> 01:21:16,105
[SPEAKER_03]: and we've got a couple of our, I think, you know, Chatterbox is always up there.

1192
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:20,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Evil Avatar, it's their 10th anniversary for evilavatar.com, so they're doing a big thing as well.

1193
01:21:21,487 --> 01:21:26,189
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Evil Avatar Radio is one of our affiliates and stuff, so we're planning on doing some big stuff at PAX.

1194
01:21:26,529 --> 01:21:26,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1195
01:21:26,789 --> 01:21:32,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to see you guys represented with or without the Tingle outfit, but I think the Tingle outfit would be awesome.

1196
01:21:33,072 --> 01:21:34,432
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mid-August, right?

1197
01:21:35,393 --> 01:21:36,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Last weekend in August.

1198
01:21:36,313 --> 01:21:37,353
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually Labor Day weekend.

1199
01:21:37,734 --> 01:21:38,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

1200
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:41,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means, well, it's the same weekend as DragonCon.

1201
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:44,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for you especially.

1202
01:21:45,093 --> 01:21:45,773
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a bummer.

1203
01:21:46,874 --> 01:21:47,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I chose PAX.

1204
01:21:48,155 --> 01:21:50,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, PAX is more gaming anyway.

1205
01:21:50,356 --> 01:21:53,038
[SPEAKER_06]: DragonCon's a little more D20s and stuff, right?

1206
01:21:54,579 --> 01:21:58,682
[SPEAKER_03]: DragonCon's more, you know, let's all fawn over Joss Whedon and everything he's touched.

1207
01:21:58,842 --> 01:21:59,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Joss!

1208
01:22:00,544 --> 01:22:02,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, DarkSakura might choose to go there.

1209
01:22:03,942 --> 01:22:07,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't phrase it that way.

1210
01:22:07,364 --> 01:22:08,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Josh is the man.

1211
01:22:08,545 --> 01:22:10,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, I haven't been to PAX.

1212
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go.

1213
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:17,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, I like what I'm hearing, and we'll have to see what we can do to make that happen, especially if it's a long weekend and it's that far off.

1214
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:19,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why at least I can't get up there.

1215
01:22:20,391 --> 01:22:23,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, if the monies work out, we can get everybody up there somehow.

1216
01:22:23,713 --> 01:22:24,554
[SPEAKER_06]: We might be able to make it work.

1217
01:22:24,754 --> 01:22:27,155
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to get the wife to agree to let Loki go.

1218
01:22:27,215 --> 01:22:31,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I might actually be able to go because we do our game conferencing at my work,

1219
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:32,199
[SPEAKER_06]: E3 E3

1220
01:22:56,823 --> 01:22:57,143
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

1221
01:23:21,252 --> 01:23:21,572
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.

1222
01:23:21,612 --> 01:23:23,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a lot of stuff that E3 didn't have.

1223
01:23:23,513 --> 01:23:28,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's way more community oriented and it's basically what people thought E3 was.

1224
01:23:28,895 --> 01:23:30,816
[SPEAKER_03]: People who've never been to E3, it's what they thought it was.

1225
01:23:30,836 --> 01:23:32,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like it's going to be a ton of fun.

1226
01:23:32,356 --> 01:23:33,597
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll definitely have to make that happen.

1227
01:23:33,617 --> 01:23:46,362
[SPEAKER_06]: The only reason I didn't go last year, the only thing that stopped me from going last year is that my BFF from college got married that exact same weekend and she said if I did not go to her wedding I would be killed.

1228
01:23:46,422 --> 01:23:48,803
[SPEAKER_06]: But this year no one's getting married that I know of.

1229
01:23:50,184 --> 01:23:50,604
[SPEAKER_03]: No weddings.

1230
01:23:50,624 --> 01:23:51,024
[SPEAKER_03]: They do kill them.

1231
01:23:51,363 --> 01:23:51,883
[SPEAKER_06]: No weddings.

1232
01:23:52,643 --> 01:23:54,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Or don't plan it during PAX because I want to go.

1233
01:23:56,584 --> 01:23:59,804
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be doing live streaming from there, and so we'd love to have you guys as part of it.

1234
01:24:00,124 --> 01:24:00,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

1235
01:24:00,485 --> 01:24:01,425
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what we can do, Bobby.

1236
01:24:01,785 --> 01:24:05,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Bobby, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap this show up before it's getting really late for you guys out there.

1237
01:24:05,765 --> 01:24:06,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to wrap it up.

1238
01:24:07,686 --> 01:24:08,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill the ferret.

1239
01:24:08,526 --> 01:24:08,766
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1240
01:24:08,786 --> 01:24:09,146
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try.

1241
01:24:09,746 --> 01:24:09,986
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1242
01:24:10,786 --> 01:24:11,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, Bobby.

1243
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:15,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And we look forward to being partnered up with you on Sunday nights.

1244
01:24:15,887 --> 01:24:16,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

1245
01:24:17,447 --> 01:24:18,788
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a lot of fun on April 13th.

1246
01:24:19,068 --> 01:24:19,368
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1247
01:24:19,408 --> 01:24:20,128
[SPEAKER_06]: That's D-Day.

1248
01:24:20,568 --> 01:24:21,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, Bobby.

1249
01:24:22,009 --> 01:24:24,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I always enjoy hearing from Bobby.

1250
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:27,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to close up the Skype line now.

1251
01:24:27,932 --> 01:24:30,373
[SPEAKER_06]: We're running a little long here in Part B, which is okay.

1252
01:24:30,713 --> 01:24:34,195
[SPEAKER_06]: We can go as long as we want, and we'll get to continue to go as long as we want on all games.

1253
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:35,695
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not scheduling anything after us.

1254
01:24:35,755 --> 01:24:36,256
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful.

1255
01:24:37,096 --> 01:24:41,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, but Loki did want to get to some last-minute stories, so I suppose we should get those out.

1256
01:24:41,778 --> 01:24:44,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I have a ton of them now, thanks to you cutting me off all the time.

1257
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:45,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Dick.

1258
01:24:46,611 --> 01:24:47,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1259
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:51,834
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just go down the list then of all the wonderful stuff, whether it be important or not.

1260
01:24:53,055 --> 01:25:00,038
[SPEAKER_07]: SOCOM Confrontation comes out on the PSN, or the PlayStation Network, September 16th.

1261
01:25:00,459 --> 01:25:04,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll be a great addition to, I guess, the SOCOM series.

1262
01:25:04,761 --> 01:25:05,441
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty.

1263
01:25:06,221 --> 01:25:09,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, look forward to that in the fall.

1264
01:25:09,723 --> 01:25:11,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Another game coming in the fall, Far Cry 2.

1265
01:25:11,924 --> 01:25:13,945
[SPEAKER_07]: That's coming to consoles or at least Xbox 360 and PS3.

1266
01:25:15,308 --> 01:25:43,290
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as PC no word on exactly when but fall-ish area Madden turns 20 this year and Madden 09 will be coming out August 12th as well as a collector's edition which will feature exclusively NFL Head Coach 09 which I'm glad because that game sucks or at least looks like crap I know the first one didn't sell very well for me and I don't want to push this one so awesome and let's see here

1267
01:25:44,509 --> 01:25:49,191
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a rumor about what Sega will be showing off at their Gamers Day.

1268
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:56,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the stuff rumored in there, a brand new Knights game and also a new Eternal Arcadia game.

1269
01:25:57,994 --> 01:26:02,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other stuff, of course, a preview for Sonic Unleashed, which I think we've all seen that anyways.

1270
01:26:04,096 --> 01:26:04,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

1271
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:05,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoopsie.

1272
01:26:06,057 --> 01:26:07,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And a game called The Crucible, Evil Within.

1273
01:26:07,898 --> 01:26:09,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that's not based off the book.

1274
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:15,534
[SPEAKER_06]: and... You know where I want to go with this and I'm just biting my tongue.

1275
01:26:16,735 --> 01:26:21,939
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is too funny that they are actually thinking about putting a game about witch trials out.

1276
01:26:22,379 --> 01:26:22,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Witch!

1277
01:26:25,301 --> 01:26:26,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's based on that.

1278
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:28,904
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't write that, folks.

1279
01:26:29,084 --> 01:26:29,804
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't write it.

1280
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And Super Monkey Ball for the iPhone.

1281
01:26:33,387 --> 01:26:33,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Tentative.

1282
01:26:34,948 --> 01:26:36,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Samba de Amigo.

1283
01:26:37,209 --> 01:26:39,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, Samba de Amigo on the iPhone?

1284
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:39,990
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1285
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:40,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1286
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,230
[SPEAKER_07]: We.

1287
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:41,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1288
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:42,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1289
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:42,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1290
01:26:43,111 --> 01:26:43,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1291
01:26:43,651 --> 01:26:46,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That's coming out this summer, by the way.

1292
01:26:47,071 --> 01:26:56,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember we talked a little bit a while back about that homebrew game being made, Super Mario Fusion, that's going to have levels featuring Mega Man and Halo and stuff like that?

1293
01:26:56,613 --> 01:27:04,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they have a new video up now that shows one of the new suits you can get from Mario, which is a Mega Man suit with all the sound effects and stuff from Mega Man.

1294
01:27:04,254 --> 01:27:07,955
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also apparently a Halo Spartan suit that you can get from Mario as well.

1295
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:10,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So looking for that game when that comes out eventually.

1296
01:27:11,352 --> 01:27:18,196
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a rumor that some DS-like colors are coming to the UK soon, including green, ice, blue, and red.

1297
01:27:19,117 --> 01:27:23,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not surprised because Nintendo likes to put out a ton of different colors of these things.

1298
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:30,204
[SPEAKER_07]: A French retailer is listing Grand Theft Auto 4 for the DS, although that might be a misprint, but who knows.

1299
01:27:31,104 --> 01:27:32,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here...

1300
01:27:35,509 --> 01:27:40,251
[SPEAKER_07]: EchoChrome's coming to the US like we said, I think sometime in April for $10.

1301
01:27:41,092 --> 01:27:41,832
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's not bad.

1302
01:27:42,713 --> 01:27:50,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now you can actually download on the PlayStation Store R-Type Command if you want to play a demo of that for the PSP.

1303
01:27:50,357 --> 01:27:53,518
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that one that's like a RTS R-Type game.

1304
01:27:55,139 --> 01:27:55,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

1305
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:56,540
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of weird.

1306
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1307
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:02,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Another game coming out in April, Happy Tree Friends False Alarms coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1308
01:28:03,364 --> 01:28:03,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be...

1309
01:28:04,537 --> 01:28:04,937
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX Live Arcade

1310
01:28:34,130 --> 01:29:03,822
[SPEAKER_07]: 3-4 player multiplayer tag battles and single player standard driller single player quest driller 100 puzzles so that's kind of neat let's see here and that's it alright that was a lot of last minute stories there's a lot of late breaking stuff tonight or just stuff we were too lazy to get to otherwise and I'm going to post this in chat room it's a wallpaper featuring portal you know their portal warning signs it's funny

1311
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll check that out.

1312
01:29:07,982 --> 01:29:12,725
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to bring us to the end of our show, except we've got one more thing to do, and that's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1313
01:29:13,045 --> 01:29:14,166
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1314
01:29:15,307 --> 01:29:15,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Ferret.

1315
01:29:19,009 --> 01:29:22,131
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is, why did I go out and get the ferret?

1316
01:29:22,171 --> 01:29:24,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have just told her that I lost it forever.

1317
01:29:25,653 --> 01:29:27,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm nice, that's my final thought.

1318
01:29:27,154 --> 01:29:27,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm super nice.

1319
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:28,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I could have kicked you.

1320
01:29:29,195 --> 01:29:30,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought.

1321
01:29:31,102 --> 01:29:34,445
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I want to get to playing some more games this week.

1322
01:29:34,525 --> 01:29:37,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot on my plate and a lot that I haven't gotten to yet.

1323
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:42,551
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully we'll get some curling action going on after the show.

1324
01:29:43,514 --> 01:29:44,555
[SPEAKER_07]: on JustinTV.

1325
01:30:06,398 --> 01:30:08,020
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something you kind of have to learn.

1326
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:13,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd be pretty pissed off if I didn't have a high-def TV and I was trying to do video out on that stuff.

1327
01:30:13,245 --> 01:30:21,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it works for UMD movies, but why they can't implement that for the composite cables is beyond me.

1328
01:30:21,352 --> 01:30:21,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1329
01:30:21,693 --> 01:30:22,073
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1330
01:30:22,671 --> 01:30:25,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
