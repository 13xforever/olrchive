Mario Kart Wii also gets a date and online texting

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How are you Miss DarkSakura?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm well

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're well, that's good

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, I'm well

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're well, alright

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll explain why momentarily

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But first I have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How are you doing, Loki?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Good

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Alright

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sorry I don't have anything extra for you tonight, but you know, that's what happens

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I gotta say though, very interesting troubleshooting before the show

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We were kind of joking last week on the show that February is the month of Broken here on Orange Lounge Radio

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And unfortunately it looked like March was going to turn out the same way

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because for whatever reason we have a wireless network that sits inside the house here where we tape

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And for whatever reason just last week when we were doing the short show

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It suddenly decided that the strength is not going to be as powerful anymore

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And the Justin TV cam would not see, that runs off an iBook that would no longer see the WiFi network

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And then tonight Jamie's computer decided it wasn't going to see the network either

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I have no idea what's going on with the box

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But very impressed with the technical skills behind

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What did we do? We turned your computer

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We turned my computer into a gateway

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So it's using my wireless internet connection

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But I have an ethernet cable and you ran it to the old router

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So it's bouncing wireless to the router to my laptop, wireless to the other router

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So right now

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We'll do a piggybacking

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam which is back this week

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hi guys

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is going through this router

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That goes through Loki's computer

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That goes through the router in the house which goes to Comcast

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And the internet

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Amazing

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is uber geek tech talk here on Orange Lounge Radio

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's like a wireless orgy

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Alright

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have something for Jamie

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And it's actually her birthday present

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And it's like six weeks early

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Because it's something you have to prepare for

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I'm going to give this to you

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Plus I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So I think this is a good time for me to give this to you

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So here you go

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Open it up and see what they're tickets to

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Alright and hopefully she likes it, I hope

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wow I know they heard this squeak on Justin TV

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yay

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Tell the listeners what I got you

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Rob got me a ticket to see Margaret Cho

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now in here locally

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now I'd also like to point out, look at where the seats are

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Eee

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's like close

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's third row

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Probably look up her nose

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Third row tickets

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So quite excited

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yay

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh my god where is this?

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Davis

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Really?

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So it's not that far at all

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Cool

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There we have it

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So mark that date on your calendar

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's May something something

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm doing that right now

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alright

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There you go

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I thought that would help after a poopy week

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So like I knew I had to tell you

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Or get tickets independently somehow

102
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I didn't even know

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I didn't either, I got an email about it

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So there you go

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I know Jamie loves some Margaret Cho and I do too

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She's pretty funny

107
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hopefully she's not quite so political

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But you know

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She's still somebody I like

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes me and you

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Cool

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alright

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There should be two there

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I was like

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I thought so because I was like

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No you have to take me I'm sorry

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Of course

123
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No this is so cool

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you Rob

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Alright you're welcome

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Now we can get to talking about video games yes?

127
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Alright

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So we're done with Tech Talk

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We're done with Oprah

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now let's talk

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's talk video games

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How was your gaming week

134
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Dark Sakura?

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
My gaming week was

136
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well it was interesting

137
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I picked it up

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then I had other stuff to do

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because I watched Tron earlier in the week

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was like

142
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I love Tron I want to play Kingdom Hearts

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because of the whole Space Paranoids level

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And there was a lot of burnout

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And I watched Dan play a lot of burnout

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I played a lot of Ragnarok

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That was it

148
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Alright

149
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well Loki how was your gaming week?

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
My gaming week was okay

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I played

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I actually picked up Pop Tippon

153
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I've been playing quite a bit of that

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In fact that's what I was playing before the show

155
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's fun

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's different

157
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I like it

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's very easy to play

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But I guess

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It takes some time to build up your armies and stuff

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then I played

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I actually purchased N Plus

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
On Xbox Live Arcade

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And that game is just as fun as the original N

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So thoroughly enjoying that

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Because we were having this party

170
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We have at the end of every month for our work

171
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And this one happened to be leap year themed

172
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And so they wanted Frogger

173
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And they used my system to play Frogger

174
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So I got to play some of that

175
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Because no one else was touching it

176
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And then

177
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So that's actually pretty cool

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I finally got to the point in the game

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Where one of the characters dies

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Not necessarily a main character

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But I was just very surprised

183
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
On how everyone makes that argument

184
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Of video games being art and stuff

185
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Shit I think there's a perfect example right there

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Of how powerful they can make the story

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And it was pretty cool

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm about 11 hours into it now

191
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Still on the first disc though

192
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And just taking my time through that

193
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And

194
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Pretty much that's it I guess

195
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Other than the usual Saints Row

196
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But

197
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No one wants to hear about that

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
For the five billionth time?

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well let's see

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
In my gaming week I also played Lost Odyssey

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And I had much the same experience as you did

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I got to the second disc

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Which means you kind of go through

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Some big plot twists in the first event

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or first disc let's put it that way

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And I'm amazed by the game

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flak

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
As it has been

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Although you know I do understand

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Some of the little complaints about the game

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And even one of them I find to be kind of annoying

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And that is lack of save points

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
One of the things that has been bugging me

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is that sometimes I'll be forced to sit there for an hour

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
While the next part of the game loads

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Or whatever

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I mean it just takes forever

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's crazy

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
To get to the next save point

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
While you watch through all these cut scenes

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I mean it's not like it's bad

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not like you're bored or anything

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Or you're just getting antsy

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because there's lots to do

226
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But sometimes I only want to play in little 30 minute chunks

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It auto saves too for some things

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Some things

230
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
There's checkpoints I guess

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But not a lot

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I haven't had that problem with save points

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What do you think about the difficulty of the game?

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's not that difficult

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Some of the boss battles were surprisingly tough

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you grind some of the way through there

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Because a lot of this game seems like it's very quick

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There's certain areas in the game

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Where there's like two or three sections of the map

240
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And then that's it

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And then you're on to the next section of the world

242
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Or whatever

243
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's very small

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know it wasn't that difficult

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You just grind a little bit

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And get your characters leveled up

248
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it's pretty easy

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Also I have the preorder bonus

250
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So I have an item that gives me

251
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A level 2 guard or whatever

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I can block most of the shots

253
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And it does zero damage to me

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Nice I don't have that

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That was something you got for preorder huh?

256
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hopefully they release that as a download thing later

257
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It will probably come later on

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's go over to the chatroom

259
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The chatroom has their own comments

260
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It only sucks when you die an hour without a save

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Kind of true but there's also some things

262
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Where you go through cutscene cutscene cutscene

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And then you have to fight a big boss battle

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I mean I know you can skip cutscenes

265
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But even then sometimes you have to sit there

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Because some of the cutscenes are rendered with the game engine

267
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So you have to kind of sit there

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And press A A A A A

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can also pause it

270
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And hit the back button

271
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
For the cutscenes but what about the ones where they're actually talking to each other

272
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
With the dialogue boxes

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You have to A A A

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't know

275
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It doesn't matter

276
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's honestly just a tiny little blemish

277
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In what is otherwise a magnificent game

278
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That deserves to be getting more attention than it is

279
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
As far as other games I've been playing this week

280
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm playing Smash Brothers Brawl

281
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Because I was

282
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Loki was kind enough to loan me his Japanese copy

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And the Wii to play it on

284
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So I was checking that out a little bit this week

285
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Didn't understand what I was doing but I was having fun

286
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Playing just the massive

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Free for all mode

288
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So that was pretty cool

289
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Obviously last week I was sick

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
On the show and I'm happy to report I'm better

291
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I did have a sinus infection

292
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So I had to go to a doctor and antibiotics and blah blah blah

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He lent me that as kind of like a get better soon type thing

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Which was very nice

295
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He said I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time

296
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I didn't actually hook that thing up till like Friday

297
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's exactly why I loaded tickets

298
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is exactly what I'm doing

299
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not playing Smash Brothers

300
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well I mean even before Smash Brothers Brawl

301
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I never played Melee very much

302
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Maybe once at a friend's house

303
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The first Smash Brothers Brawl I didn't even touch

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't know

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not really my type of game

306
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's fun

307
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But you know

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I may pick up the US one

309
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Gerardimo in chat says

311
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Rob do you think Brawl lives up to the hype even if it's not in English?

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Kind of

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's hard to tell

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't feel right giving a fair review on a Japanese game

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
When I don't understand how to get into some of the modes

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And look at the extra stuff

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It does

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Lowkey has no problem answering that

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The parts I've seen so far

320
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like Smash Brothers Melee 1.5

321
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
A little bit

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Because it's like the same kind of engine

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The same stuff with just some new characters

324
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But I realize that's not being totally fair

325
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In saying that because I haven't looked at everything outside

326
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Of just the brawling

327
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But it does seem like there's a lot of the stuff they just copied

328
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Right on over from the GameCube version

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So very interesting

330
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Frisbee says

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Halo 3 feels like Halo 2.5

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a little bit that

333
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's a little bit that

334
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But that's what it is

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So that was my gaming week

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So if that's everybody's gaming week

337
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Then we will move on to talking about some news

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But for some housekeeping

339
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Of which we have nothing special of note

340
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What's that?

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What's that?

342
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The award contesting that's going on through all games

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's like three months old

344
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't believe you just saw that

345
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I did just see that

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Hey I don't read

347
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I unfortunately don't read their website

348
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Or their forums

349
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're just too busy

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Doing other things

351
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I will give it a mention on air

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't even know if it's still going on

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I think it's kind of funny that Loki took so long to find it

354
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I posted a link on the forums

355
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let me see

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
December 27th

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I didn't even notice it

358
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
All games

359
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Which our show runs on

360
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We syndicate on their network

361
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They play us Monday nights

362
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And then Tuesday mornings

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
At 9am

364
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No because they do their regular

365
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
All games show at 10 now

366
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings

367
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But I know our show is syndicated on their network

368
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Mondays and Tuesdays supposedly

369
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard

370
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
As a best affiliate podcast

371
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And it's all going on in their forums

372
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The voting

373
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I would think it's already over

374
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Three months ago

375
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But then again the topics are still up

376
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's not closed

377
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So who knows, maybe it's an ongoing thing

378
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
From yesterday to today

379
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They've put the votes as anonymous

380
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So you can't see

381
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What each podcast has

382
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yesterday it didn't have it that way

383
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And Tigerclaw says Sky they still haven't announced the winners

384
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So I guess it is ongoing

385
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
For three months now

386
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And Tigerclaw I know listens to all games

387
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like every other day

388
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't know

389
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I voted for us

390
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well I appreciate the support

391
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I guess for yourself

392
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby

393
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But he bought a knife judgment

394
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I can't support that kind of behavior

395
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's most unfortunate

396
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He also dropped out of the race

397
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
As of like yesterday

398
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Didn't want to play that game huh

399
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Alright well if you want to throw us a vote

400
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's over on forums.allgames.com

401
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will plug the other stuff I know we always got

402
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We have our live general community at Orange Lounge

403
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And our Facebook is the O.L.R.

405
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Be sure to look us up on our social networking sites

406
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Meet other O.L.R. listeners

407
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Look at our posts and clips of the show

408
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
We have on some of those places like MySpace

409
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Tons of fun

410
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Alright let's get into the gaming news. Loki take it away

411
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week

412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
From Destination and Playstation

413
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's the retail only

414
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Conference thing or whatever

415
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I couldn't go but other people from my company did

416
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Bastards

417
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And of course

418
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Some of the news that leaked out

419
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date finally

420
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's officially coming to the U.S.

421
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
On June 12th

422
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And that of course

423
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Not only was leaked out but confirmed

424
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
By Konami

425
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And they also said that if you reserve your copy

426
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Of Metal Gear Solid 4 starting in April

427
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
2008

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You get Metal Gear Saga 2.0

429
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
A DVD to catch you up on all the

430
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Stuff that's going on in the series

431
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
As well as a

432
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Data code for

433
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Metal Gear Online

434
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And then to coincide

435
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
With that and this

436
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't know if this is going to be the official

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You know remember because the 80 gig

438
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Skew for the PS3 was being phased out

439
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well there's a new 80 gig Skew now

440
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Same price but you get

441
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3

442
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Controller all for $4.99

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Which is not a bad deal at all if you don't have

444
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
A PS3 because I know a lot of people

445
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Would be buying a PS3 for that

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And it's nice that they're actually throwing in

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that

448
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Separately

449
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No word on when that's coming out but it's

450
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Supposed to come out around the same time as

451
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 obviously

452
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So June 12th and on

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I guess

454
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Alright

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Well moving on to

456
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Other gaming news although it still

457
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Actually

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Let me back up for just a minute

460
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
How important

461
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is this news to PlayStation

462
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Fans you think?

463
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I think it's very important

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than

465
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The year old MotorStorm

466
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They needed to update that bundle

467
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Anyways because

468
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Shit that game is old now

469
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game

470
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
To throw in there especially now that

471
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with

472
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The DualShock 3 controllers

473
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Probably not the 40 gig for right now

474
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Because there's supposedly

475
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The one right now doesn't have it

476
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And I don't know if they're going to announce a new one

477
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Anytime soon

478
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's important

479
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I think this game is actually one of the first

480
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Major games for the PS3

481
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That you can only get on the PS3

482
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And you know that's

483
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
A little bit of fuel to Sony's Fire

484
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Although this is the first of hopefully many

485
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But

486
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It hopefully does very well

487
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's say

488
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 does not sell

489
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
All that I mean let's say

490
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Obviously the game is going to sell fine

491
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
At least mediocre

492
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But let's say the game does not sell super duper well

493
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And doesn't move all these new bundles

494
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Is that going to be really bad for Sony

495
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Or will they get more chances?

496
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They may have more chances but a lot of the stuff

497
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That they're counting on is like way later on

498
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Killzone 2 will be another one that moves systems

499
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Resistance Fall of Man 2

500
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Maybe MotorStorm 2

501
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then

502
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Final Fantasy 13 that's so far off

503
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That I wouldn't even

504
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Consider that anything to wait for

505
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Right now for the PS3

506
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If you're going to wait that long you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4

507
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But

508
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
At the same time

509
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't know

510
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It should do very well

511
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But once again you know they're also hoping

512
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Like Blu-Ray is going to sell these systems

513
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You know it's a lot of hopes and dreams

514
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But we'll actually have to see what happens

515
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I mean it'll be a very interesting spring

516
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
My parents got a Blu-Ray player

517
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Which kind of surprised me

518
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Because they're not usually on the cutting edge

519
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Of all the technological gadgets

520
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And I was playing with their Blu-Ray player a little bit

521
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And it was slow

522
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It was so slow

523
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And I'm sorry I know sometimes we get the mail

524
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Like you guys only pick on Sony

525
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We hate Sony

526
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Because if we hated Sony we would so have a PSP oriented website

527
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But anyway it's beside the point

528
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But seriously it was slow and clunky

529
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It reminded me

530
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah it's the first generation I kind of think

531
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Okay well the first DVD player we ever had

532
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Was kind of slow and clunky too

533
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I remember when I had a single speed CD-ROM drive

534
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Now that's slow shit right there

535
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well Rob you know what

536
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What?

537
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-Ray player

538
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why?

539
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We got an HD DVD player

540
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Did you? Did you get the one for the Xbox?

541
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes we did, 50 bucks

542
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Nice

543
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh yeah because they're so cheap now

544
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Well the only movie I really want on it is Stardust

545
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So I don't care what else Dan gets

546
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You picked up a couple of movies

547
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I don't really care because that's all I'm getting

548
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
There you go

549
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Nice

550
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Alright well obviously Metal Gear Solid is one thing many PlayStation 3 fans are looking forward to

551
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But there's also Metal Gear Online

552
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And we already talked about

553
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
In a previous show the Metal Gear Online

554
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Starter Pack that's supposed to be going out

555
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
With Metal Gear Solid 4

556
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Well they're going to be beta testing Metal Gear Online

557
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
In late April

558
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But here's the deal

559
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4

560
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You will get guaranteed access

561
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Quote unquote to this limited beta

562
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a little bit reminiscent

563
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It seems to me like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing

564
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think

565
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There you go

566
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But I'm sure most people that would be into Metal Gear Online

567
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4

568
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This is just incentive I guess to get pre-orders out there

569
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Which makes sense to me

570
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That Sony would want that

571
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Because they're going to want strong numbers out the gate

572
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's impossible to try and put next to

573
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Halo 3

574
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And what I'm assuming

575
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Will probably be Smash Brothers numbers

576
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And so on and so on

577
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's kind of like their day one big seller

578
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's going to be the number one game for the console

579
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's just

580
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Halo 3 may have

581
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Been the number one game

582
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
For the Xbox 360

583
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But I don't think it's sold that many systems

584
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I mean I'm sure there's people that waited to buy a system

585
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
For Halo 3

586
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know

587
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game

588
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems

589
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But then again

590
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Their system is still more expensive

591
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And it's a little easier now

592
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
To make that purchase now that we know

593
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That Blu-Ray is going to be the high def format

594
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Of choice

595
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now

596
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And we know when it's coming

597
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And plus now you have

598
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Grand Theft Auto 4 as well

599
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there

600
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But

601
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They can't just rely on these

602
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Couple games to push the sales

603
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They really need to put out a strong library of games

604
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And they have a lot of catching up to do

605
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Alright well

606
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
For you Metal Gear Solid fans

607
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You might want to go pre-order the game if you want to check out the

608
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Online beta

609
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you don't already have it pre-ordered

610
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Which I'm sure many of you do

611
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Well

612
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
There had been talk that Metal Gear Solid

613
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Was going to be ported to Playstation 2

614
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's actually not happening

615
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's just going

616
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That the Metal Gear Solid

617
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Essential Collection is going to be on

618
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Two DVD's

619
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's supposed to be out on

620
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
March 18th for 29.99

621
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Over here in the US

622
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's going to be a Playstation 1 game

623
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's awesome

624
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Well I wouldn't see

625
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
There would be no point to really remake

626
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Metal Gear Solid for Playstation 2

627
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Maybe there were people that were hoping

628
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Because there was the GameCube one

629
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills

630
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
When it came out?

631
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think so

632
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Maybe people were hoping some of those extra frills would come over

633
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm surprised that they didn't put

634
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Metal Gear Solid 1

635
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And then also have VR missions

636
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
As well

637
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Well my theory is that they are going to

638
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This is again just my theory

639
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Because really all

640
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The VR missions was part of Metal Gear Solid Integral

641
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Which was

642
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Basically Metal Gear Solid done as a first person shooter

643
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
All you need to do is put in the camera control

644
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And you can play it that way

645
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So they could easily

646
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Include the VR missions and the

647
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I guess integral mode

648
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Hmm

649
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well it's neat

650
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I mean I guess it's not too

651
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
If this Playstation is backwards compatible

652
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And all that at least what little

653
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Backwards compatibility some of them have

654
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's not surprising that they only need to put it out there

655
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
On Playstation 1 format

656
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Exactly and if I remember correctly

657
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I believe this collection is coming out

658
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
In a couple weeks

659
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Should be able to pick it up soon

660
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And it's cheap 30 bucks

661
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Very cool

662
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
A really cool

663
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well you know not cool for me because I already own

664
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
A couple PSPs but for someone that may not own

665
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
A PSP yet you can get a brand new PSP

666
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Slim that happens to be red

667
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
With a giant head of Kratos

668
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Silk screened on the back

669
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This will actually be replacing

670
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The Star Wars entertainment bundle

671
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That they've had for a while

672
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You can no longer get those unfortunately

673
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And of course it will be coming out

674
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I believe next week

675
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
With the brand new game

676
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Of course God of War Chains of Olympus

677
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And some other cool stuff that will come

678
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
With this entertainment pack

679
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It will come with a copy of

680
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The Superbad UMD

681
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
As well as a voucher to download

682
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Syphon Filter Combat Ops

683
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
From the PC Playstation store

684
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Now here's my only little problem

685
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
With this whole thing

686
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Usually these entertainment packs come with

687
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
A 1 gigabyte memory stick

688
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I have heard no mention of a 1 gigabyte memory stick

689
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
With this so

690
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yay I can download a game to nothing

691
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You have to buy a memory stick separately

692
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Way to go awesome

693
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This might be a bad idea

694
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But do you think we're just supposed to assume

695
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's there anyway?

696
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I don't think it is because they would have mentioned it

697
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It would have been a selling point

698
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Hey surprise me

699
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Maybe it is in there

700
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm just going to take a while to guess

701
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
As they didn't mention it

702
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And I don't think it was in the press release

703
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Although I will double check in just a second here

704
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm pretty sure it does not come with a memory stick

705
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Which is kind of sad

706
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Now Alpha Canagram in chat says

707
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Loki bigger sizes are dirt cheap

708
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
1 gig is useless

709
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That's fine okay

710
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But the fact is it's still stupid to offer

711
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
A free downloadable game

712
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A voucher or whatever

713
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's worth I guess 10 bucks

714
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
When you don't have anything to store it to

715
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Well here's my thought

716
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What about the fact that

717
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
My roommate was hooking up a new printer today

718
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And it didn't come with a USB cable

719
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
To hook it up to the computer

720
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So it's kind of that same logic to me

721
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Batteries not included except now it's other things

722
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Memory not included

723
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I understand

724
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Buying a game console back in the day

725
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Didn't come with a memory card

726
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
To save your games and stuff

727
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's completely optional but

728
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I mean come on

729
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
God of War, Chains of Olympus, Syphon Filter

730
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You're going to need a memory stick

731
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And it's just kind of annoying that you get it all home

732
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Or something you get it for Easter or something like that

733
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And it's like

734
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah I'm ready to play this game

735
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Aw shit I gotta go drive back down to the store

736
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
To pick up my memory stick

737
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I don't know I think it's still kind of cheap

738
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But whatever

739
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I mean if that's kind of your thing

740
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Then go ahead and purchase it

741
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And it'll probably be limited

742
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Since the last one was too

743
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Although I think

744
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Most people that are all crazy about God of War

745
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Most of them probably already have a PSP don't you think?

746
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's always what amazes me about these

747
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Bundles that come out so much later

748
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But oh yeah this is also coming out

749
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
In June-ish I mean that around

750
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That time frame so it's going to be three months after

751
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The game actually comes out

752
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't know it's cool I guess if you don't

753
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Have one yet I mean maybe

754
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You might think about picking this up

755
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But to be honest the only reason I picked up

756
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
My Daxter bundle was because it was the only thing

757
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Available at the time so

758
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It wasn't like I really wanted to play Daxter

759
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Another comment from chat

760
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
From ake ripper I think that is

761
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
A K E ripper

762
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's chat.orngelandstranger.com says

763
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Still one gigabyte you don't get far

764
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You know what

765
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm using my 16 memory

766
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
16 megabyte memory stick

767
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That came with my original PSP

768
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
32 or whatever it is I'm using the old school original

769
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
One from the first PSP bundle

770
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Hey you know what that's fine

771
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's the thing right now

772
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Say you can't

773
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Just throw in a 32 meg one

774
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later

775
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But hey you know what at least it will get you through

776
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Being able to save your game

777
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box

778
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And I'm sure since those

779
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
One gigabyte memory sticks are what 30 bucks

780
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Now the 32 megabyte one should be like 50 cents

781
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
If that

782
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Come on they've got to be sitting on a bunch of them

783
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Just dump that shit

784
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Hey I'm not alone

785
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We have another chatter in chat and I cannot pronounce this name

786
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
For the life of me it's

787
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
TVVICHMAN

788
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I don't know

789
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Says I still use my 32 so I'm not alone

790
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So there you have it

791
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Well you know a lot of people

792
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Very excited about home

793
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Even though it keeps kind of getting pushed back

794
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And pushed back but you know what they say

795
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
As long as there's reason and purpose

796
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Behind pushing it back then sometimes

797
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It isn't all necessarily a bad thing

798
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Apparently

799
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Some big Sony games are going to be integrated

800
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Into home and those games are Warhawk

801
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Uncharted, Drakes, Fortune and Resistance

802
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Fall of Man and assumably these are just

803
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Three to start and you know obviously more would follow

804
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I imagine you know big

805
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Other big titles even from third party publishers

806
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Would be included here too

807
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Warhawk is going to let eight people

808
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Meet in like a war room area

809
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Prior to a match and you can make out

810
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Your strategies on a sand table

811
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That's like a replica of the different levels

812
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
In the game and then you go right from there

813
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Into your match so

814
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Kind of cute and then Resistance and

815
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Uncharted basically your avatars

816
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Can go into levels from those

817
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Games and that would allow you

818
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
To get to parts of the game that are even completely

819
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Unseen now in addition to that

820
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Uncharted is supposed to have a 2D shooter game

821
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That's built into it that launches from home

822
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So that's some cool ideas

823
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That sounds fairly

824
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Generous and kind of neat

825
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You know I imagine the shooter

826
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Is cheesy but it's better

827
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Than nothing and it's probably kind of one of those

828
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Like cool little you know integrations

829
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The news about

830
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Home is very exciting and it makes

831
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Me wish it would have been out a lot sooner but

832
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You know okay if the delays are making it better

833
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Then it's hard to complain right? It's all part of their plan

834
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
To hopefully get more momentum I mean and this is

835
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Also stuff that they can say look here

836
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Live does not have this

837
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This is why you should buy a PS3

838
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
They're giving us reasons now why you should

839
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Own a system which is what they should have been

840
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Doing since the beginning

841
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Frisbee in chat says push it back

842
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Until no one cares am I right?

843
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't know but the more they drop little tidbits

844
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Like this it's hard to ignore

845
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah but at the same time though it's like

846
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You know Duke Nukem Forever

847
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Come on dude I would like to see a little

848
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
More video of this stuff

849
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
In action not just screenshots I mean

850
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You know just because that really

851
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Video helps you get so much more of a sense

852
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Of what it really looks like than pictures

853
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The trophy room thing

854
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's kind of neat I guess but at the same time

855
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm just like whatever

856
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Like I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room

857
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And see a stupid dragon from Lair

858
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'd be like wow

859
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Testament that you played Lair

860
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Man you suck

861
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Well you know what though Xbox is the same thing with the achievements

862
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You know you get certain achievements

863
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Well it's like I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room of like

864
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Achievements that they've earned during like you know

865
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Totem Ball or some shit

866
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You played the game for ten hours or something

867
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Wow you have dedication

868
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You pressed start

869
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Achievement unlocked wasn't that one in the Simpsons game

870
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Madden or

871
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Simpsons maybe or Avatar

872
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You hit something eight times in a row

873
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
1000 points unlocked

874
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I don't know Jamie are you excited about

875
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Home on Playstation 3

876
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Relatively

877
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm excited because it's free if I had to pay for that shit

878
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm not playing in home

879
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Free is a good thing

880
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Then again Yaris was free

881
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Oh that is a good point

882
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Touche from Jamie

883
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record

884
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Well there actually

885
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Is a date now for that

886
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Dual Shock 3

887
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Over here in the US we're getting it on April 15th

888
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
For $54.99

889
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And I don't want that for my birthday

890
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So nobody get it for me

891
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But it's

892
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I mean it's basically

893
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
From what I can tell in here

894
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The 6 axis with vibration

895
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So

896
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So basically it's the controller that should have come out

897
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The first time it's finally coming out

898
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yeah except for all the crappy legal

899
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Problems they were having

900
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
What was the price again on that

901
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That's a $54.99

902
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
$54 bucks for a freaking controller

903
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But then again Xbox is just as bad right

904
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Isn't it like $59 for their wireless

905
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's the same price as their current controllers

906
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
He rumbles $5 extra

907
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I guess

908
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That is too damn much for a controller

909
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Wait no I actually rumble

910
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Well tilt sensors in rumble are $5 extra

911
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Well it is also wireless

912
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But still

913
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah the wireless controller

914
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I don't know

915
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I don't give Xbox a pass here either

916
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I think their controllers are way too expensive too

917
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And then the Wii one is just as bad too

918
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The controllers are way too damn much money

919
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I have to say something though for the Xbox 360

920
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Controllers that the keyboard attachment is cool

921
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Really?

922
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I haven't even really played with one ever

923
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the

924
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Remote nunchuck because the remote is $40

925
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And the nunchuck is $20

926
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So it's $60 all together

927
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I don't know I guess maybe for some reason

928
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I let Nintendo slip by a little more

929
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And I know people want to call it fanboyism

930
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But I don't here's my logic

931
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price

932
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because that controller is

933
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Really kind of like the core of the system

934
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And the motion and everything

935
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But I don't know I guess one could argue that

936
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's the same thing on the Playstation 3

937
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't know what the motion should on the Playstation 3

938
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Is very like kind of

939
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Last minute?

940
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Not really last minute

941
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But just kind of useless I think

942
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I like this comment from Alpha Canagram in chat

943
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
He says Skye wait

944
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube

945
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Was most expensive

946
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That's true because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance

947
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
If you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles

948
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You had to get four of those

949
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You know we actually still kept our Game Boy Advance for that reason

950
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So that we could play Pac-Man vs.

951
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I was going to say I can only think of like

952
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Three games that even use that feature

953
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Not four because there's Animal Crossing was one

954
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And yeah Animal Crossing

955
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Pac-Man vs. Crystal Chronicles

956
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And Zelda for sorts

957
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And that's really it just a handful of games

958
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But Pac-Man vs. is awesome

959
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii

960
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You start to see more of that stuff too

961
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Didn't Pac-Man vs. come out on the Namco Museum DS?

962
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yes that's right

963
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's pretty cool

964
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It is pretty cool

965
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Not enough to get me to buy Namco games all over again

966
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Those classic collections that keep re-releasing

967
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Random thoughts

968
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Speaking of classic collections

969
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It just kind of made me go huh

970
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I was randomly at a record store earlier this week

971
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Because I was gasping shock and awe

972
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Buying a CD I know I know

973
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I was actually buying a CD

974
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And this place sells video games as well

975
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
They sell used video games

976
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I actually saw on the play

977
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And I was actually looking at like old Genesis

978
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything

979
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Like really like cool in the retro stuff

980
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It was all sports

981
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It was all sports stuff like Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL

982
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So that's pretty much all they had

983
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But one thing I noticed on the Playstation 2

984
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Is an Activision anthology

985
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And I never even knew this game existed

986
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Because the Activision releases an anthology

987
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
On every system

988
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You know they had one on Playstation 1

989
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They've had one on the PC

990
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I actually own the one on PC

991
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
They've had a ton of them

992
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I didn't realize they had one on Playstation 2

993
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But I just thought it was funny

994
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Because I'm reading the back of the box

995
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Like all the games that are in it

996
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And like this is how they're selling the game

997
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Is that A it talks about you can do cool effects

998
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
To the games while you're playing

999
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Like you can play Pitfall

1000
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's even an Activision compilation

1001
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Pitfall 2 and some of these other

1002
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Like really obscure Activision games

1003
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure

1004
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The other ones that were listed were very obscure

1005
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Like Bridge

1006
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What's that?

1007
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I think I'm going to order a freeloader

1008
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You're going to order the Activision one?

1009
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
No a freeloader

1010
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Oh freeloader? Oh

1011
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
We'll talk more about that a little later I bet

1012
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So another person jumping from the Sony ship

1013
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Would be Phil Harrison

1014
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
He's actually resigned from

1015
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Sony Computer Entertainment

1016
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Which is sad because that only leaves

1017
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Kaz left and

1018
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Luckily though it's not

1019
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Was it not

1020
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Oh god

1021
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The crazy guy

1022
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Ken Kutaragi

1023
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Thank god he's not the only one left

1024
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Piloting this boat here

1025
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
No that does leave Kaz

1026
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I believe there were some rumors on where

1027
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
He was going to go

1028
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Between Atari

1029
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
To I don't know why he would jump

1030
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
From one ship to another sinking ship

1031
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But whatever

1032
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But sad to see him go because

1033
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
He was actually kind of a voice of logic

1034
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I guess for the company

1035
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But who needs that?

1036
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Really

1037
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know

1038
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But that is weird

1039
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
If it's true he went to Atari

1040
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That's kind of like

1041
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I don't know but maybe he can help fix things there

1042
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That would be nice to see them turn around

1043
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Alright well

1044
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
With all this talk about Lost Odyssey

1045
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And what a great RPG it is

1046
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out

1047
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That were actually really amazing

1048
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
One of them was Persona 3

1049
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And I admit I did not get to really play much of Persona 3

1050
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is

1051
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it

1052
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Because apparently

1053
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Persona FES which is an expansion

1054
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
To Persona 3

1055
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Is coming out here in the US on April 22

1056
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And it will set you back $29.99

1057
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But the cool thing about it

1058
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Obviously this is a Playstation 2 game

1059
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's not in the current gen of consoles

1060
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It's in Playstation 2

1061
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But obviously that's what a lot of people still have

1062
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But for such a low price

1063
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
For such a huge game

1064
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You get both the enhanced version of Persona 3

1065
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And new bonus features

1066
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And a new chapter that is apparently 30 plus hours

1067
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So this is kind of like Oblivion game of the year edition

1068
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But for Persona

1069
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
5 bucks which isn't bad

1070
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
There's still pretty good stuff coming out in the Playstation 2

1071
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And luckily a lot of the people

1072
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That put out really crappy shovelware games

1073
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
For the PS2

1074
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Have now moved to the Wii

1075
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So you get a pretty good crowd

1076
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Although there are still some

1077
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But luckily now they've adopted the price point at $14.99 retail

1078
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Which you can't beat that

1079
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Even if it does suck

1080
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Well you can download a lot of games

1081
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
For five bucks

1082
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So I don't know $14.99 still feels too expensive

1083
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
For me for a crap game

1084
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You know Hannah Montana goes to college

1085
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Or whatever the hell they put out

1086
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't know I pulled that name out of thin air

1087
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You want to know what status I think they would make that game?

1088
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
They just might

1089
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Patent pending

1090
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
She goes to college, she's rich

1091
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana

1092
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Even if I were really rich I would want to be fully educated

1093
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
True

1094
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But then again if you're

1095
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I think in my mind it's the perfect

1096
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
A puppet of Disney then

1097
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
In my mind it's a sitcom

1098
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Just like Saved by the Bell went to college

1099
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
At one point

1100
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney channel stars

1101
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Need to go to college at some point

1102
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That's their exciting surroundings

1103
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
That would have saved Brittany from her fate

1104
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Perhaps

1105
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Goofy goes to college

1106
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Can I read the next story please?

1107
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You may

1108
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Well Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out

1109
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It says it will be out in time

1110
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
For the winter holiday

1111
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
To be

1112
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Politically correct

1113
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm so excited that they're releasing Game On Festivus

1114
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Decemberween

1115
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Gives you something to celebrate

1116
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?

1117
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's island themed

1118
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Which is so, you know

1119
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Wintery

1120
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That might be kind of fun though

1121
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I did think the first one had too much dirt

1122
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
This one seems to have plenty of dirt in it too

1123
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It's in the middle of a desert

1124
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm sorry

1125
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Too much dirt for you

1126
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Although, you know what

1127
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I really have to say that

1128
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The artist's joystick

1129
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Where we got this information from

1130
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Are very creative

1131
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon

1132
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Because I don't think they've done a

1133
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Good off-road moon racing game

1134
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Actually

1135
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
There was Cruise in the World

1136
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX

1137
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Cruise in the World had you go play on the moon

1138
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And then you ran into aliens

1139
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub

1140
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Thank you

1141
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Malholus in chat

1142
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I hope I'm pronouncing that right

1143
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
We have a lot of new chatters tonight

1144
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Malholus in chat says

1145
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Moon Patrol

1146
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Damn straight

1147
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That's all the moon game you need

1148
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?

1149
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I was just thinking

1150
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
There's all these bastardized Atari games

1151
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
From years past

1152
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Why didn't they ever put out a bastardized Moon Patrol?

1153
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That's what I'm curious about

1154
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What picture am I looking for?

1155
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
The screen capture

1156
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
They took a picture from Motorstorm and put

1157
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Microsoft Paint

1158
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I have to show this in the chatroom because it's hilarious

1159
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Oh, I just thought of it

1160
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Hannah Montana

1161
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Goes to her first frat party

1162
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Hannah Montana

1163
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
goes wild

1164
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs

1165
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Hannah Montana gets a podcast

1166
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
They already do crap like that

1167
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's called the evening news

1168
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There you go, Malholus again

1169
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Hannah Montana goes to the moon

1170
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
There it is, right there, two things we need

1171
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Alright, enough of this

1172
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana

1173
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
We do not need more Hannah Montana

1174
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
We need less Hannah Montana

1175
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
What we do need more of

1176
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Is more colors in PS3

1177
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And there is a rumor

1178
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I was just thinking that

1179
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I know, I wasn't

1180
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I can read minds

1181
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's a

1182
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's a skill I learned

1183
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So

1184
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
There is a new SKU coming out for the

1185
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
48 PS3, I know this for a fact

1186
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3

1187
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The Blu-Ray

1188
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Because Sony thinks, you know what

1189
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Blu-Ray is the winning format

1190
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3

1191
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You will just buy your own fucking

1192
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Blu-Ray movies

1193
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So there is going to be a new SKU coming out

1194
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And apparently

1195
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Some Circuit City employees

1196
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Have begun receiving their shipments

1197
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Of these new PS3s

1198
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And on the shipping box there is a model number

1199
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Which is CECHH01

1200
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And for those who may remember

1201
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
A while back when we covered that the FCC

1202
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Had a

1203
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Item filed from

1204
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Sony regarding a white PS3

1205
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
While the item numbers

1206
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Happened to match

1207
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So is it going to be the white system

1208
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Coming out to

1209
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Replace the black one with the

1210
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Spider-Man 3?

1211
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Maybe? I don't know

1212
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
We'll have to see I guess

1213
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
But if that's the case

1214
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's going to be coming soon

1215
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Are there really people that are like

1216
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I mean do these people really really exist

1217
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
That are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3

1218
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Until they release them in white

1219
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Or until they release them in red

1220
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Or what are the colors that we talked about

1221
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The silver thing that we talked about

1222
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
On another show in another country

1223
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Are there really those people

1224
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I don't think that there are

1225
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
People maybe with the DS because it's cheaper

1226
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But I don't think color is really going to

1227
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I don't know

1228
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Sway you on buying the system or not

1229
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
People aren't going to go

1230
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's $400

1231
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
If only it were in white

1232
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I would really just make the purchase

1233
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I just need something that matches the drapes

1234
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And black doesn't do it for me

1235
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I fucking hate when they come out with new system colors

1236
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Because then they have to come out with new accessory colors

1237
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And new everything colors

1238
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And it just sucks

1239
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Lots of comments in chat

1240
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Brad from PodCulture says

1241
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I waited until Blue to get my DS

1242
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
With Nintendo though it's inevitable

1243
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
That they're going to come out in other colors

1244
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
That is still a little crazy

1245
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing

1246
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But you'll notice whatever happened to the pink Wii

1247
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Whatever happened to that

1248
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
They didn't need to do it, that's what I guess

1249
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
SSJ100Matt says

1250
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3

1251
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Damn right, I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3

1252
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
That would be the best

1253
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you'd like to join in

1254
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
We do try to keep an eye on JustinTV's chat room as well

1255
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But sometimes I have a hard time staying on top of that

1256
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Because that's two different chat rooms

1257
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That's a lot

1258
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Something you're going to be able to play on those

1259
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
White PlayStations

1260
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Would be lots and lots of games coming to the PlayStations store

1261
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
25 old school titles have been leaked

1262
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
By the European version of the PlayStations store

1263
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Well also

1264
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
There are some pretty cool titles in there

1265
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
No, there are some very cool titles in there

1266
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That's what makes me think it's probably fake

1267
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's not fake, these are from the European version of the ESRB

1268
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Is where they got these titles from

1269
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I thought it was the store delete

1270
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Well they're coming to the PlayStations store

1271
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The PEGI

1272
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I guess leaked this information

1273
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I thought it was Sony that accidentally somehow made these visible for a minute

1274
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well then I guess it's legit

1275
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And there are some cool games coming out

1276
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Bust a Groove, Holla

1277
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Those folks that like their old school music games and stuff

1278
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Very excited to hear that

1279
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Crash Bandicoot 3

1280
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3

1281
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies

1282
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Everybody's Golf, Klona

1283
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Klonoa, sorry

1284
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Klonoa is like the best game ever

1285
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Kurushi Final, Motortune Grand Prix

1286
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Namco Museum 1, 2 and 4

1287
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I don't know what happened to 3

1288
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Omega Boost, Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4

1289
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Rollcage, Spyro

1290
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Tekken 2, 3

1291
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Twisted Metal, Vib Ribbon

1292
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097

1293
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Vib Ribbon

1294
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
That's pretty awesome

1295
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
That game is crack

1296
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And actually I don't know if a lot of people remember

1297
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Colony Wars is actually pretty decent as far as the space shooter goes

1298
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Same with Cool Borders, that was pretty fun

1299
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Omega Boost was awesome

1300
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Son of Dad says Intelligent Cube please

1301
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
There you go

1302
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
He said don't they have the PSP one?

1303
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Didn't they come out with like a sequel-ish thing to that game?

1304
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah they have a couple of them

1305
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Let's see, Crunky Boy Jr. in chat says

1306
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared it right up

1307
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Hey, Klonoa was a great game

1308
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But it was messed up at the end

1309
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you

1310
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Nice

1311
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So in other bundle-y news

1312
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
In Europe they're going to get a

1313
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Pretty decent bundle I'm going to say

1314
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
That is the

1315
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle

1316
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And it's a 40GB PS3

1317
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm sorry, my apologies

1318
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
80GB

1319
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh sorry, they're doing two of them

1320
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
My apologies

1321
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I was just staring at the red box

1322
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Because it's, well

1323
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Kind of red and black and very cool colored

1324
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And it's got a silver car up on the front of it

1325
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I can't see what it is though

1326
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But they are saying that

1327
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It's going to be

1328
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Out on a

1329
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's going to be

1330
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Out on a

1331
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It's going to be out on a

1332
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It's going to be out on a

1333
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's going to be out on a

1334
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Looks like a

1335
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
March 29th

1336
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And retails for

1337
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
$3.99 Euro

1338
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So that's pretty cool

1339
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I love all this hubble-oo over

1340
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Prologue, it's not even the actual game

1341
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's just prologue

1342
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
You know to be honest I think this game

1343
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Is going to hurt their sales for the full game

1344
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You think? A lot of people like

1345
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
If I were to, if I had to buy

1346
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
A Gran Turismo game I don't think I'd buy the full one

1347
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Because I don't race 200 cars

1348
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You know there's only a few cars

1349
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
That actually probably race

1350
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And you know after I play this game

1351
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You know prologue for however

1352
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Many months until the full game comes out

1353
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'll probably be sick of it

1354
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And just be like okay whatever I'm done

1355
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm not going to spend another $50 or whatever

1356
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
To upgrade to have

1357
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
More cars

1358
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Now the smart thing to do

1359
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Would be to release the retail version

1360
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Of Gran Turismo 5

1361
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And release a $20 update

1362
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That would give you all the additional cars

1363
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And tracks

1364
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
That would never happen though

1365
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
RossdielUT in chat says

1366
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Loki Gran Turismo isn't for you it's for crazed car freaks

1367
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
There's another bundle listed on here too

1368
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
What's that?

1369
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
A blu-ray bundle

1370
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The 40GB PS3

1371
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
With Spiderman 300 and Casino Royale

1372
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
On March 19th

1373
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Now that's reasonable

1374
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That Blu-ray has officially won or whatever

1375
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
That's you know totally understandable

1376
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
There's a lot of people that are going to buy

1377
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
PlayStation 3 just because it plays Blu-rays and games

1378
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people

1379
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
To do that because that's how PlayStation 2 won

1380
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Hey I bought my PlayStation 2

1381
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Well actually no I didn't buy it

1382
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
As a DVD player I just bought it because

1383
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Armored Core was coming out on it

1384
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And I love me some Armored Core

1385
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Except I didn't buy Armored Core 4

1386
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Whatever

1387
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I liked what Akdeft in chat says too

1388
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Gran Turismo 5 prologue, Gran Turismo 5 introduction, Gran Turismo 5

1389
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And then Gran Turismo 5 epilogue

1390
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And yet no Gran Turismo portable for the PSP

1391
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series

1392
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It's like Final Fantasy 7 games now at some point

1393
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And they'll have Final Fantasy

1394
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
You know prologue with cars

1395
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
You know Gran Turismo

1396
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Gran Turismo with dress fears

1397
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
There's different kinds of chocobos

1398
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Do you get to try out different chocobos?

1399
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Well you may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5

1400
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
There are plenty of other games

1401
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
To get your attention this week

1402
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Starting things off we have Bully Scholarship Edition

1403
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360

1404
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Slightly better than I guess the PlayStation 2 version

1405
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Because it has slightly better graphics

1406
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And a few more missions

1407
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Great

1408
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
The game I teased last week

1409
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

1410
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Coming out on the DS

1411
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Worst name ever

1412
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
If you're into baseball

1413
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Or most unintentionally funny name ever

1414
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Depending on how you look at it

1415
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
There's going to be two games for you

1416
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Sony's MLB 08 The Show

1417
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And that's coming on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PSP

1418
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And then MLB 2K8

1419
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360

1420
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
We have Army of Two coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

1421
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Chicken Hunter on the DS

1422
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's a stupid game where you kill chickens

1423
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So it's not just a clever name

1424
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
No, it's very literal

1425
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And imagine Figure Skater

1426
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It is a game where you are a figure skater

1427
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And you get to do little gay ass moves

1428
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yay, Figure Skater

1429
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I'm almost offended by that comment

1430
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to Figure Skater

1431
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah, exactly

1432
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Let's see what else we have here

1433
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Also, Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC

1434
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Awesome

1435
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week

1436
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
God of War Chains of Olympus

1437
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Coming out on the PSP

1438
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
That looks pretty awesome

1439
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Pets Bunnies for the DS

1440
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yes, you too can raise bunnies now

1441
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Hooray

1442
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Let's see

1443
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Just a small little game called Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii

1444
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That will be coming out a week from today

1445
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Hooray

1446
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Ninja Reflex is coming out on the Wii and the DS this week

1447
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
For your Ninja themed party games

1448
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
World Championship Cards for the PSP

1449
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
In case you want to play something other than poker

1450
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Mystery Dungeon Shiren the Wanderer coming out on the DS

1451
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Let's see

1452
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
We've also got Spitfire Heroes Tales of the Royal Air Force

1453
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
That's on DS as well

1454
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And Homies Rollers on the DS

1455
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
You're like Homie the Clown

1456
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures

1457
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
They can get out of those machines for 10 cents

1458
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Oh, my boss used to collect those

1459
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Let's see

1460
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I believe that's it

1461
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Smash Brothers Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week

1462
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance

1463
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
But maybe there's a certain audience for that, I don't know

1464
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I will tell you what

1465
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Uh oh, what

1466
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies

1467
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Oh no, here we go, here we go

1468
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies, yes, what?

1469
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We'll do the whole Tingle thing and we'll burn Eye of Judgment

1470
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
We'll need another game in there, just more of a chance

1471
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?

1472
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah

1473
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Great

1474
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The makers of that game just thanked you for selling like, you know

1475
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
About a hundred additional copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise

1476
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Here, I'll make it even more fair, the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever

1477
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa

1478
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment now

1479
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yes

1480
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell a hundred thousand copies

1481
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Somebody mark the date and time of this

1482
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Oh, it's almost exactly seven o'clock here on Sunday evening, March 2nd

1483
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It will never sell anything, okay, come on

1484
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Well that's something, that's giving the listeners

1485
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
That's for the little meter some of the chatters made up

1486
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that looks like a telethon thing

1487
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And it's like the road to one million copies

1488
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It'll never happen

1489
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Now it gives them something to add to that

1490
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It'll never ever happen

1491
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never ever sell

1492
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Here's the thing, chat room

1493
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You gotta get him, you keep adding games to it

1494
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total

1495
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Oh yeah, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that

1496
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Gold Banjo says another one for the OLR wiki

1497
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I forgot to mention Housekeeping, this would have been good

1498
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio

1499
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And you can wiki stuff on it

1500
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Even though I guess, well we have an official Wikipedia article

1501
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
But now we have our own freaking entire wiki

1502
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really

1503
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
You'd think I wrote it or Loki wrote that article

1504
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
But we've never really worked on that

1505
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It was totally the fans that did that, so that was really cool

1506
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I haven't even seen it

1507
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
On Wikipedia?

1508
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Oh, well I thought you meant, oh you meant on Wikipedia

1509
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia

1510
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
A wiki set up for us

1511
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
But now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki

1512
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
That's what I was talking about

1513
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Yes, that, well I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out

1514
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It's orangeloungeradio.wikia

1515
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
That's W-I-K-I-A dot com

1516
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So check it out, Orange Lounge Radio

1517
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And somebody just linked it in chat as well, so check that out

1518
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Alright, meanwhile, let's go back to traveling the globe

1519
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And looking at upcoming releases

1520
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And we'll start on the Xbox 360 in Japan

1521
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
You get a new version of the console coming out

1522
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
The Xbox 360 Arcade hits Japan

1523
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And with that comes some price reductions, yay

1524
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Including Riot Act, which you might know as Crackdown

1525
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And Saints Row gets some price reductions this week

1526
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
On the Xbox 360 in Japan

1527
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Coming out on the Playstation 3, the DualShock 3 makes its way out there

1528
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
As well as Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock finally comes out in Japan

1529
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
The Satin Silver, that's what I was trying to think of earlier

1530
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
The Satin Silver Playstation 3 comes out as well

1531
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Continuing our trip in Japan on the Nintendo Wii

1532
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Family Jockey comes out in Japan

1533
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Also Metroid Prime 3 Corruption

1534
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I did not realize this game had quite the delay between the US and Japan

1535
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But it is finally coming out in Japan this week

1536
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So I guess we're not the only ones that have to wait for big titles sometimes

1537
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It looks like Japan had to wait for this one

1538
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
That's kind of surprised me

1539
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And I looked to see if it's a price reduction or something like that

1540
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
It's not, it's full price

1541
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So this must be the first time they're getting that

1542
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So that kind of surprised me

1543
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin

1544
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And it comes with a

1545
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Nobunaga's ambition something

1546
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I don't

1547
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Online I think

1548
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
But it comes with what's called a power-up kit

1549
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And I'm not exactly sure what a power-up kit has in it

1550
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So this is something they haven't released yet

1551
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games

1552
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Perhaps

1553
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The same thing with Double Kings or whatever they call that over there

1554
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes

1555
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's drugs

1556
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Perhaps

1557
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But it does look like another version of Nobunaga's Ambition

1558
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Dang, the last time I played this game was on the NES

1559
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And look how far it's come

1560
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It's like Civilization

1561
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I remember Civ I, I have such fond memories

1562
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It has a Nobunaga's Ambition game that came out

1563
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
The beginning of February

1564
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
For PlayStation 2

1565
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore

1566
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
They're too complicated for you

1567
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I'm not smart enough to play those games

1568
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'll admit it

1569
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I think that's just exactly what it boils down to

1570
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
They're too much for me now

1571
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
They get too complicated

1572
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The Nobunaga's Ambition party game

1573
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah, they need like

1574
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
You know how they dumb down Madden for Wii owners?

1575
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
That's what I need

1576
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I need a dumbed down version of Nobunaga's Ambition

1577
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Swing the remote down to conquer Japan

1578
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It's too bad they don't have achievement points

1579
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And I accidentally closed out my list

1580
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So I'll tell you what

1581
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Why don't we go to Europe and then we'll come back to Japan

1582
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Well you know what that actually makes me think?

1583
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Did we ever get a current gen release of Risk?

1584
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Not that I can think of

1585
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?

1586
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It'd be cool if we had Risk and Axis and Allies

1587
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Wouldn't that be cool?

1588
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That would be very cool

1589
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I love games like that

1590
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Oh wait, I got the Japanese release dates back

1591
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Never mind

1592
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Europe can wait a little longer

1593
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
They're used to it

1594
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That was me

1595
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It was

1596
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Below the bell

1597
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I'm sorry

1598
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Party foul

1599
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Dear European listeners

1600
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Please send Rob a smack in the head

1601
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Send me your cards and letters

1602
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Send me your cards and letters

1603
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Whatever, they get Mario Kart early

1604
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That's right

1605
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So, you know, shut up

1606
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Go stuff yourself with a crumpet

1607
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Hey

1608
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I love Britain

1609
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I love all of Europe

1610
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I love France

1611
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I love Spain

1612
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I love them all

1613
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Alright

1614
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
On the PlayStation 2

1615
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well

1616
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And guess what

1617
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
There wasn't enough Pachinko in your life

1618
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Hisou Pachinko Pachi Slot Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well

1619
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of Pachinko

1620
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that

1621
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
On the Nintendo DS

1622
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Bomberman gets a price cut

1623
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Doraemon no Bitaton Midori no Kyojinen DS comes out

1624
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
In other words, it's Doraemon on the DS yet again

1625
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And lastly on the PSP

1626
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And then I promise we can do the Europe dates

1627
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable

1628
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That is a combo kit of those games

1629
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's like an Ultimate Hits

1630
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So there you have it

1631
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And also Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits

1632
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The Lenneth and what was the other one?

1633
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Slo-Mera or whatever it was called

1634
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
They both move into the Greatest Hits collection

1635
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Alright, now that all of Britain hates me

1636
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And Europe in general

1637
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Let's go to their release dates, shall we Jamie?

1638
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Fine

1639
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Well these are all on the 7th

1640
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And one of them pisses me off

1641
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
But I have a certain bias against it

1642
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

1643
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Blacksite Area 51 on PS3

1644
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000

00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Dynasty Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3

00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Jack Keane on PC

1648
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
MX vs ATV Untamed on a bunch of crap

1649
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one

1650
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
The Destiny of Zorro on Wii

1651
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Victorious Boxers on Wii

1652
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K Dawn of War

1653
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?

1654
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Victorious

1655
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Oh Victorious, I thought you said Victorias

1656
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And I'm thinking like, is that like Victoria's Closet for men?

1657
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Like now they're expanding

1658
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls

1659
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
You mean Victoria's Secret?

1660
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
She has a penis?

1661
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
No, I thought you said Victoria's Closet

1662
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Oh maybe

1663
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
That was a really crappy show

1664
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
That was Veronica's Closet, it was Chrissy Alley

1665
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
No, Victoria's Secret

1666
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I thought I heard her say Victoria's Boxers

1667
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Maybe my mind is just focused on underwear right now, I don't know

1668
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
See, you said Victoria's though

1669
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
These boxers are victorious!

1670
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm thinking up Spice Girls

1671
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
If they're a pair of boxers and on the back of them is a big peace sign

1672
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You know, like the V for victory or whatever

1673
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
A hand doing a V

1674
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Please, let's change the topic

1675
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I hate Warhammer 40K

1676
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Why?

1677
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Because I had an ex who did nothing but play Warhammer 40K and paint his retarded little models

1678
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
On and for days at a time

1679
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I tried painting those once and then I saw that they're 6mm tall

1680
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'm like, fuck this, I am not doing this

1681
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And I'm a big gamer, I love gaming

1682
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But there just comes a point where there's this weird obsession with the little figures

1683
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And for building terrain from scratch

1684
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And that's all he ever did

1685
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So yeah, I broke up with him to play with, you know, to hang out with some guy that played rifts

1686
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It was fun though, running over those little figurines with a toy train

1687
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Because, you know, if you're going to build your own landscape

1688
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
You might as well already have a train set and landscape built already for that

1689
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Well, I can understand having a project, that's one thing

1690
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But when your entire life is your project, that's a little something else

1691
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That and you didn't have a job

1692
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Speaking about building little figurines

1693
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spinoffs for different games

1694
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Including Indiana Jones and Star Wars

1695
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo

1696
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue

1697
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
But they have screenshots to prove that it's real

1698
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts

1699
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
But, sure, if you want to believe

1700
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
The minute I saw a headline that said

1701
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was

1702
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I was like, oh, haha, funny, April Fools joke

1703
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I hate April Fools

1704
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
You know

1705
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

1706
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It would be cool if it were real

1707
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I don't think it is

1708
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And I don't think you would try

1709
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It's not, come on

1710
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine

1711
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You know

1712
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And, of course, it's their exclusive, they say

1713
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And stuff like that

1714
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Trust me, if this wasn't a real exclusive

1715
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
1UP.com would be whoring the shit out of this

1716
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Right now, okay

1717
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Because they like to tease their exclusives

1718
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So

1719
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Whatever

1720
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You don't need any more Halo

1721
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Or Lego Halo

1722
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Well, I almost thought this was a joke when I first read about it too

1723
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
But, no, it is true

1724
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And it's one of the more interesting types of development in gaming

1725
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I've heard in a long time

1726
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Okay, here's the thing

1727
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
You know Treasure made a shooter years ago called Bongio

1728
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Bongio

1729
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Bongio

1730
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Which is not a classic game

1731
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah, well, that's right

1732
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
It's coming out on the DS, right

1733
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
As Bongio Spirits

1734
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yay

1735
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
That's not the part I thought was a joke

1736
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Here's the part I thought was a joke

1737
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It uses what's called sound load

1738
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And what you do, you share custom levels

1739
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
High scores and replay videos

1740
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
But you don't do it using the built-in Wi-Fi or any of that

1741
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
No, no

1742
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
It's sound

1743
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That's right

1744
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Because the DS has a microphone and a speaker

1745
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I guess you put the DS's really close to each other

1746
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And what happens is that the data is turned into noises and sound

1747
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And it's played out the speaker of, you know, your DS

1748
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And then your friend picks it up on his microphone

1749
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Or his or her microphone DS

1750
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And turned back into game data

1751
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
What a weird concept

1752
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And the other

1753
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's Treasure

1754
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Treasure's

1755
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And the other thing you can do with this

1756
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Is you can put them in like MP3 format or whatever

1757
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And spread them out on the internet

1758
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So people can download them that way

1759
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's Treasure

1760
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It's kind of neat, I'll admit

1761
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
But I totally, like when I first read this

1762
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm like, this is the weirdest thing I've ever heard

1763
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
But yeah, and then I'm thinking like

1764
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Wow, we could like put a custom level on our podcast

1765
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And be like, okay Bongio owners, turn on your

1766
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
You know, and that's probably exactly what they want

1767
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Which is why this feature's in there, but

1768
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Let's do that

1769
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Because everybody loves listening to the sound of a modem

1770
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
When you pick it up

1771
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Or if you put a CD in a regular

1772
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Or if you put an old CD-ROM in a regular CD player

1773
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And you're like

1774
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It was like

1775
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Did you ever put in the Symphony of the Night CD

1776
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And then listen to the hidden track?

1777
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Yeah, but the thing about PlayStation

1778
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yes, I have done that

1779
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
But the thing about PlayStation discs

1780
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Is for whatever reason

1781
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I don't know if this is the coding or whatever

1782
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
But if you try to play track one on a PlayStation disc

1783
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It's silence

1784
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You won't hear the noise that you will

1785
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
In like an old school

1786
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Like, go find yourself a copy of Encarta

1787
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And put it in a regular CD player

1788
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And if you know what I'm talking about

1789
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You're old school

1790
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Because we did this in junior high

1791
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
We would take a copy of Encarta

1792
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And put it in a regular CD player

1793
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And it makes the most hideous noise

1794
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And what you do is

1795
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It was like the dumbass joke you would play

1796
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Is that you would turn the radio thing up

1797
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Full blast

1798
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Close the door

1799
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And run

1800
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Ah, yes

1801
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I just remember putting them in

1802
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Especially, they'd also do it on PC Engine duo discs

1803
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Who say, this is a game disc

1804
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Do not listen to this

1805
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Or your speakers will die

1806
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
That type of thing

1807
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Very interesting feature

1808
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I almost

1809
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I have to admit

1810
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I kind of

1811
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Like, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought

1812
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
To go run out and buy

1813
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Or even really check out

1814
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Just because there's too many other games on the table, right?

1815
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But now I'm kind of like

1816
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I might have to look at this game

1817
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Just for this feature

1818
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I'll tell you

1819
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
In one word

1820
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Why I'm getting this game

1821
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Why?

1822
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Treasure

1823
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I should have known

1824
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Treasure

1825
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
This whole reason why

1826
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm still looking for Chameleon Twist

1827
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Alright, well

1828
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Let's move on

1829
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
That's all I have to say

1830
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Until the game comes out

1831
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Well, I know that

1832
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Quite a number of our listeners

1833
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Are into Rock Band

1834
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So, something that everyone should be happy about

1835
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Is that there is

1836
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
A Grateful Dead pack

1837
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Coming out for Rock Band

1838
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
That will have

1839
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
China Cat Sunflower

1840
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Casey Jones

1841
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Sugar Magnolia

1842
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Trucken

1843
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Franklin's Tower

1844
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And I Need a Miracle

1845
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I think that that's

1846
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Pretty cool

1847
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Because, you know, Grateful Dead is pretty cool

1848
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Now, I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit

1849
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Because that would be the full dead experience right there

1850
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You know what?

1851
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
You laugh about that

1852
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Apparently

1853
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Okay, one of my customers

1854
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Oh no

1855
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
No, no, no, no

1856
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Not about the weed thing

1857
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
No, one of my customers actually

1858
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Saw the kit set up

1859
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
At one of the Game Stops to guest in

1860
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from

1861
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And it was actually pretty funny

1862
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
He said it just looks like a fog machine with lights

1863
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And the lights basically hook up to your sound

1864
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
They're all sound activated

1865
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Like, you know, your sound out

1866
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Or whatever your stereo system

1867
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And they react to the sound that you do

1868
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So we could do the show

1869
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And it would react to our speaking and stuff

1870
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Just what we need

1871
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And that would be funny

1872
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Alright, I'm sorry though

1873
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Well, there's a little bit more to this story

1874
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Hmm

1875
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
For people who are not so rock band oriented

1876
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented

1877
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Actually, No Doubt's having some releases on there

1878
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Which, No Doubt, cool

1879
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Gwen Stefani's solo, bad

1880
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Because she sucks

1881
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That and she's got mental problems

1882
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But, moving on

1883
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Wow, tell us what you really think

1884
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
What songs are coming out from No Doubt?

1885
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Do we know?

1886
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Don't Speak

1887
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Excuse Me Mister

1888
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And Sunday Morning

1889
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend

1890
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That's the song I love

1891
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
No

1892
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
No Just a Girl

1893
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
No Spiderwebs

1894
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
But, I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list

1895
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So I'm happy

1896
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
What song is that?

1897
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Don't Speak

1898
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Don't Speak

1899
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Alright, let's hear some clips of these songs

1900
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
That are coming to rock band very soon

1901
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Here's a clip of the Grateful Dead

1902
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
So, if you got them, smoke them

1903
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Just kidding that's bad

1904
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in rock band

1905
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And then we have coming to

1906
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Not coming to Grateful Dead

1907
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Coming to Guitar Hero 3

1908
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
We have No Doubt

1909
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak

1910
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So let's play one of the more lesser known songs

1911
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Which would be Sunday Morning

1912
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Sappy Pathetic Little Me

1913
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,000
That was the girl I used to be

1914
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You had me on my knees

1915
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I'm glad I breathed some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and rock band in general

1916
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Rock band, the wheels keep on turning with that game

1917
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Proud Mary keep on burning?

1918
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I don't know

1919
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Not yet, maybe someday

1920
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Anyhow

1921
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And not to be outdone

1922
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
From the studio that brings you Hannah Montana

1923
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Disney has announced a brand new game for the

1924
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert

1925
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
No!

1926
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
It's Ultimate Band

1927
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
You know, fuck this rock band shit

1928
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It's the Ultimate Band

1929
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS

1930
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
One thing though that you will be happy to know

1931
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And maybe this might be a sad thing

1932
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Is that there will not be any peripherals for this game

1933
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
It'll be all with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck

1934
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
So you have to imagine how you're gonna actually play these songs

1935
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
They have a screenshot that shows apparently the guitar portion of the game

1936
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Which looks like it's gonna use the two buttons on the nunchuck as your fret buttons

1937
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
So you have two fret buttons

1938
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
You have one, two, zero, or both

1939
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
This sounds like Ultimate Suck

1940
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You know what?

1941
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I'm gonna say something pretty daring here

1942
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I think this actually isn't a bad idea

1943
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Because think about who this game is aimed at

1944
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It's aimed at kids

1945
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And parents don't want to spend all this freakin' money

1946
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
On all these peripherals that their kids are gonna destroy

1947
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
So you know what? If you've got a Wii

1948
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Why not come out with a game that's very similar to Rock Band

1949
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
But that you don't have to buy all this extra shit for

1950
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And of course I'm not gonna like it

1951
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Probably Jamie, Matt, they're not gonna like it

1952
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It's not really made for us

1953
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I'll try it

1954
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It's a kids game

1955
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I don't think I'd buy this game

1956
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But I'll try it

1957
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays

1958
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And the DS version will have that brand new

1959
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
CD gamer online social network

1960
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Which is sounding pretty awesome

1961
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And I really kind of want to check it out

1962
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But that means I have to buy a Disney DS game

1963
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And I don't know

1964
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
ActDeft in chat says

1965
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Skye speaks the truth

1966
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And GS68 says

1967
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Skye is right

1968
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Ego++

1969
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
The chat room actually just reminded me

1970
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming week

1971
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
What's that?

1972
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Oh I bought Parappa

1973
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Oh rad

1974
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
For $15

1975
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
At a Hollywood going out of business

1976
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Let's see, RasteelUT says

1977
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Skye, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the Flames will disagree

1978
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Yeah well he's a freak

1979
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Hey did I just call a 7 year old a freak?

1980
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Cool

1981
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
That's fine, he's a freak

1982
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Uni in chat says

1983
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Kids already nom nom the hell out of the Wii remote

1984
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii remote and hid it under the couch

1985
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:58,000
If you're 7 year old nom noms the Wii remote and hides it under the couch

1986
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
You got issues

1987
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I don't like that phrase, that's funny

1988
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
What, nom nom?

1989
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Nom nom

1990
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Didn't you hear?

1991
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Everything is Caturday now, everything

1992
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Lolcat speak

1993
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Cronkyboyjr tries to put out a zinger here saying

1994
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You mean we save money on Wii peripherals?

1995
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Ba dum bum

1996
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Get it?

1997
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Because the remotes are so fucking expensive

1998
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
You don't really have real Wii peripherals

1999
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I mean after all there's like what, the classic controller and the nunchuck

2000
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii

2001
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Everything else is plastic shit

2002
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Alright well

2003
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You know a lot of folks are very excited about this

2004
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I'm sure Mo, remember Mo from a couple weeks ago?

2005
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yes

2006
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I'm sure she's very excited about this

2007
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Still Alive is going to be coming to Rock Band

2008
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And Valve threw a little party at Game Developers Conference

2009
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And get this, some guy actually tried to steal the song

2010
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Here's how it worked, Jonathan Colton was up on stage with his band

2011
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
They were playing Still Alive but in Rock Band

2012
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Because apparently he didn't get 100% on vocals

2013
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Which is ironically hilarious

2014
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
But whatever

2015
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So they finish, crowd is cheering

2016
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And what happens is that this guy from the crowd gets up on stage

2017
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Walks over to the 360, pulls out a memory card

2018
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Which I don't know who carries 360 memory cards with them on the go

2019
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I mean back in the day I used to carry a Playstation memory card

2020
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
When I go to the arcade and stuff

2021
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Because DDR machines had the memory card slots

2022
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
You could have two or three of those

2023
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I can't think of any reason why you would put a 360 card in your pocket everywhere you go

2024
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
But whatever, it's Game Developers Conference, whatever

2025
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
So he pulls out this memory card

2026
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
He puts it in, messes around

2027
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And then finally one of the Harmonix guys walks over

2028
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And says what's going on

2029
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And this guy says I'm just grabbing Still Alive

2030
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Everyone needs to be able to play this

2031
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Well the developer took it back

2032
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And deleted the thing off the card

2033
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And all is well

2034
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway

2035
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Because it was probably a dev 360

2036
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild

2037
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It wouldn't have worked anyways

2038
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management

2039
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Which we'll get into later

2040
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Well apparently the guy actually wrote about it

2041
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
The only reason I'm not giving this idiot of the week award

2042
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Or stupid guy of the week

2043
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Or whatever we're calling it in your award

2044
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Is because apparently the guy wrote about it in his live journal

2045
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And I don't know, don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate

2046
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It could be fanfic or some shit

2047
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I don't know

2048
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
But I think it's legit

2049
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
You can check it out on his live journal

2050
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's algorithmancy.livejournal.com

2051
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,000
That's A-L-G-O-R-I-T-A-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com

2052
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
And he writes in this entry on February 21, 2008

2053
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
He writes his side of the story

2054
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And he puts a disclaimer at the end

2055
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
He says don't try this at home

2056
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
The only reason I did

2057
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Because I am an acquaintance of Alex

2058
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Who works at Harmonix

2059
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
As well as good friends with several Harmonix folks

2060
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And game industry friends give each other free swag all the time

2061
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material is theft

2062
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So

2063
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?

2064
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Huh

2065
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
He's got a cool live journal name

2066
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That's it

2067
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
It was kind of a dumb thing to do

2068
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But at least he admits it was a little

2069
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It was a lot of a dumb thing to do

2070
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
At least he kind of admits in his live journal thing

2071
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
That it was a lot of dumb

2072
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
So you know

2073
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I'm not going to stupid award him

2074
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
When he begs for mercy

2075
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
That's what you get when you drink lots of alcohols

2076
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Exactly

2077
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Alcohol bad

2078
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
But still alive

2079
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Good

2080
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Alright, before we wrap up

2081
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Huh, what's that?

2082
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I said quite

2083
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Before we wrap

2084
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in the studio?

2085
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
No

2086
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Did you hear our idea

2087
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I don't remember if this is the week you were gone

2088
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Because February was all fucked up

2089
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
But were you here the week we had the idea

2090
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
That when it comes out

2091
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We'll get Mo back

2092
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
And she'll be our vocalist

2093
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And we'll get Matt to play drums

2094
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
You can play guitar

2095
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
You and I can work out the guitar somehow

2096
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And we'll have an OR band

2097
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
And we'll do our rendition

2098
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
It was mentioned last week

2099
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Was it last week?

2100
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I can't remember

2101
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I'm getting old and the weeks blend together

2102
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
That's okay Rob

2103
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Alright

2104
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Anyhow

2105
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I'm still bringing you your birthday present

2106
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Sweet

2107
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Alright

2108
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Speaking of getting old

2109
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
The older we get

2110
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
The more we reminisce about the classic games

2111
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And that's why we like to pay tribute

2112
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
To the classic game of the week every week

2113
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Dark Sakura likes to respect her elders

2114
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
In the gaming world

2115
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
By paying tribute to old classic games

2116
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
So let's dust off a dusty game

2117
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And see what Dark Sakura's picked

2118
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
For this week's classic game of the week

2119
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
What is it?

2120
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
This is actually one of my favorite arcade games ever

2121
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And I have it on Saturn

2122
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It's Cyber Troopers Virtual On

2123
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Which is a 3D robot fighting game

2124
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Done from a behind the view

2125
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Of your own character who you're playing

2126
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Let's take a listen

2127
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And almost every other sample of it online was horrible

2128
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
So moving forward

2129
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
You basically play as a virtualoid

2130
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
A giant robot controlled by a person

2131
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Which is actually pretty funny

2132
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Because there are little insert things

2133
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Where the pilots go in the back of the market for Saturn

2134
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
In the sequel Virtual On

2135
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Oritario Tangrum was a dreamcast

2136
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Which I have that game too and I got it

2137
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
But you would play as a number of them

2138
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
With different specialties

2139
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Like you have the Temjin

2140
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Which is the balanced one

2141
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
You have the Raiden

2142
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Which is a heavy battle one

2143
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Really strong and heavily armed

2144
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
You have the Amp Arms

2145
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Which is one of the fast ones

2146
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
It uses a tom-po weapon

2147
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
You have Belgor

2148
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Which is a missile launcher

2149
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
The Dorcas

2150
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Which is another pretty heavy one

2151
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
The Viper 2

2152
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
The Basbal Bow

2153
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And my favorite which is the Feiyen

2154
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Which is like the cute world

2155
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
The Mecha

2156
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Which is really fast and nice

2157
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
You have the Z-Grat

2158
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
And then you have the Jaguarladi

2159
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Which is as far as I remember

2160
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I think it was one of the hidden ones

2161
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
But in the arcade you had a 2% set up

2162
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
And it had a dividing wall in between

2163
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
So you were like in the cockpit

2164
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And it used two sticks to control it

2165
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And on Saturn they did release the twin sticks

2166
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And I actually don't have them

2167
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Which makes me very upset

2168
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Because I had a chance to get them

2169
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
They did do an Oratorio Tangram

2170
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
That was on the Dreamcast

2171
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I actually do have the twin sticks for that

2172
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
In fact, you remember your ex-roommate?

2173
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Yes

2174
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
We beat him getting them

2175
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Interesting

2176
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento

2177
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa

2178
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
We're not talking about the one I lived with

2179
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Oh, we're talking about that room

2180
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That roommate

2181
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Wow

2182
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Those were the days, man

2183
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Those were the days

2184
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
The guy who sold it to us

2185
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Ended up being

2186
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
My husband

2187
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Ended up being

2188
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I do believe Mo's manager

2189
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
It's

2190
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
You know, I know

2191
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
We're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town

2192
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
But at any rate

2193
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
We came in

2194
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
We saw the twin sticks for 45 bucks

2195
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Which was astounding at that time

2196
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And like

2197
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
We want to buy these right now

2198
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And I was like

2199
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Okay

2200
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And then

2201
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
A person who's

2202
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
As far as I knew

2203
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
His nickname

2204
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Came from this game

2205
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Came in and we beat him by like 10 minutes

2206
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So

2207
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
There were also other versions

2208
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
There was

2209
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Cyber Troopers

2210
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Virtual on Force

2211
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
That was only in Japanese arcades in 2001

2212
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And

2213
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Virtual on Mars

2214
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Which was

2215
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
The PS2 release

2216
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
So

2217
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
There's also an audio drama for it

2218
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Which is kind of funny

2219
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And then there was a musical one

2220
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Which was the

2221
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
The Feiyun robot singing

2222
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I actually have a Feiyun garage kit that I still have yet to put together

2223
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
That I bought like six years ago

2224
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Nice

2225
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Virtual on's like

2226
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Tops

2227
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Alright

2228
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Well that's going to do it

2229
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Your classic game of the week

2230
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Virtual on

2231
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Here on Orange Lawn's radio

2232
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And on that note

2233
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
We're going to go ahead and take a break

2234
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
It is the end of part A

2235
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
That's right

2236
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It's not a short show this week

2237
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
We're all here

2238
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
It's like you're finally getting a full OLR

2239
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Now it's like three weeks later

2240
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
After

2241
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Jamie being sick

2242
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Us having no show

2243
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And then having a short show

2244
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
The month of February was screwed

2245
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
But there's plenty more of

2246
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Regular

2247
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Good old fashioned

2248
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Hopefully unbroken

2249
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
OLR left

2250
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
To go

2251
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Lots of stories coming up in part B

2252
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
If you thought part A was PlayStation heavy

2253
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Which it was

2254
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Because there was a lot of PlayStation news this week

2255
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Which

2256
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Hopefully those people that email us every now and then say

2257
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You don't show Sony enough love

2258
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
You guys hate Sony

2259
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Hopefully

2260
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
We did you wrong tonight

2261
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
We have plenty of Sony

2262
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Sony stories tonight

2263
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
But in the next segment

2264
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Lots of Nintendo news came out as well

2265
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
So we'll be getting all the Nintendo news in the next segment

2266
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And some other randomness

2267
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Such as

2268
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
What is the guy that created Pong up to now?

2269
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
You might be surprised

2270
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So we're going to take a quick break

2271
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And we'll be right back with more of Orange Lawn's radio

2272
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Right after this

2273
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Orange

2274
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Lawn's

2275
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Radio

2276
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Hi guys

2277
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
It's Rob here with an important footnote

2278
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
For our podcast listeners

2279
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
There's no easy way for me to break the news

2280
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
But part B this week was lost

2281
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
And unfortunately won't be hitting the podcast feed

2282
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
And you won't get that news we promised

2283
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Unless you were listening live

2284
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
And heard all two hours of it being taped

2285
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
So I'm sure you're wondering

2286
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
What happened?

2287
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Well what happened is that we were

2288
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Taping the shows we always do

2289
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
We do a special little show after that called The Afterbirth

2290
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
It's only for live listeners

2291
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And because we play licensed music and stuff

2292
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
That we can't put on the podcast

2293
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And as we were taping that

2294
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Right at the very end

2295
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
We were trying to unjumble some of the chords back here

2296
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
And the power cord to the computer got detached

2297
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And the whole damn thing shut off

2298
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And although Audition keeps a temporary file on hand

2299
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
When I went in to recover the file

2300
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I'm in a mistake and ended up deleting the damn files

2301
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I was trying to make a backup copy of it

2302
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And I've tried everything

2303
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I can't get

2304
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
It's not in the recycle bin

2305
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Picked the chat room's brain on it

2306
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
It's gone

2307
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
It ain't coming back

2308
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
So I'm very sorry

2309
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And just when I was thinking March wouldn't be as broken as February

2310
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Anyhow

2311
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I guess one silver lining to this

2312
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Is that if you do want to hear part B

2313
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
It is still archived on the Justin TV channel

2314
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
So you can go to Justin.tv slash Orange Launch Radio

2315
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
And I believe some of our listeners are trying to make a highlight of the show right now

2316
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Now it's become this big lost archive of the show

2317
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It's like a collector's item of sorts

2318
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
We will try to get an audio rip of that

2319
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
We're probably not going to put it on the podcast feed

2320
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Because the audio quality on Justin TV is not great

2321
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Our microphones don't hook into that

2322
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It simply goes to our webcam

2323
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
And the audio is really not great

2324
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
We'll probably, if anything, if we can get an audio rip of that

2325
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
We'll probably put it on MySpace, Facebook, and all that stuff

2326
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Unfortunately part A, as all the podcast listeners are going to get this week

2327
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I am so sorry

2328
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
In six years that we've been doing this show

2329
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
We've never lost a show like that

2330
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So it's kind of embarrassing

2331
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And a little sad

2332
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Especially off of a few broken weeks in a row

2333
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
But what can you do?

2334
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Life goes on

2335
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I hope everybody has a wonderful week

2336
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Happy gaming

2337
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
And we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week

2338
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
With all new power chords in studio

2339
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Have a good one
