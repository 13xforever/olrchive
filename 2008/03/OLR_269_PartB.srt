00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:15,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 2nd of 2008, where we're taping episode number 269 of Orange Lounge Radio live, as we do here every Sunday night, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:18,329
[SPEAKER_03]: In part A, you missed a whole bunch of Sony news.

3
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:24,393
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about Metal Gear Solid 4, some of the new bundles that are coming out, the departure of Phil Harrison, just a lot of that.

4
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:27,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to get into some Nintendo news in this segment.

5
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:29,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Loki?

6
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:29,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

7
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:32,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, of course, like most things, you know,

8
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:58,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We Date, but that doesn't mean that retailers haven't figured out when it's coming out, including such wonderful websites as Gamefly, GameStop, Circuit City, and I think a few others, have it listed as April 27th, that's two days before Grand Theft Auto 4, and that would also be a Sunday.

9
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:01,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this going to happen or not?

10
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:03,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

11
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:09,563
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

12
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:13,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they're doing that to specifically get the jump on Grand Theft Auto 4?

13
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:16,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it kind of one of those, eh, I don't really have a clue.

14
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:19,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to be out of, you know, they need to press them.

15
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:22,370
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to have enough time to press those discs.

16
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, the other thing that's really going to hamper that game is the production of those fucking wheels.

17
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely retarded.

18
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:33,655
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you were a bet,

19
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:40,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good odds on that bet.

20
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:41,946
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

21
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:48,147
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe one thing that the game has been put, because it was originally supposed to come out late last year, right?

22
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it originally a Christmas release that got put back a little bit?

23
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:51,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that, our first quarter?

24
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:52,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

25
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:55,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, perhaps one reason they pushed it back is because, guess what, guys?

26
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart Wii, it looks like Nintendo has finally caught on.

27
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart Wii is going to have online chat in it.

28
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:05,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about time.

29
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:07,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Xbox has been doing this for years, right?

30
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

31
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:14,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart Wii will be supporting online text chat.

32
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:16,068
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

33
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:21,873
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to send text messages to your friends over Mario Kart Wii.

34
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:26,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Provided that they are on your friends list, you have their friend codes and all that stuff, you will be able to text.

35
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,778
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it before matches.

36
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It's assumed you can do it after matches.

37
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:49,097
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, Good Game and stuff like that.

38
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, for real?

39
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,599
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

40
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not like as cool as you would think.

41
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their way, I think, of trying to control the game right now.

42
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:00,926
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the Disney MMO.

43
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:05,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, the news must have changed slightly since the initial release that IGN did or whatever.

44
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:09,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, so now it's been... It's like the Disney MMOs.

45
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:11,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you've ever played, what is that, Toontown, I think it is?

46
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:14,195
[SPEAKER_03]: You only have a list of preselected phrases you can use.

47
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:20,429
[SPEAKER_03]: SAD, SAD, SAD

48
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:56,977
[SPEAKER_03]: RansteelUT, their names are very similar tonight, I think that's Ranma under another name, RansteelUT says, text chat, better than hearing F-M-G and N-I-M-E-R and all that stuff while playing.

49
00:03:58,097 --> 00:04:11,240
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that, in one respect I think it's a good idea, you know, because they are trying to make an effort to protect

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Their intended group, I should say.

51
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:24,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was why, you know, Publins just needed the same thing with theirs, because they don't want something with their name on it, for lack of a better description, corrupted by the people playing it, you know.

52
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in that way, I think it was smart.

53
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:31,814
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just plain waste, damn safe, that's all it is.

54
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:39,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Ran still, if he continues in our chatroom, chat.roman.com, but if you're playing online with friends, then you should be allowed to say whatever you want.

55
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:49,857
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would like to see a mode where, you know, okay, yeah, maybe it's off by default, but maybe I can go in there and turn it on or something, where, you know, if I want to call my friends gay while I'm playing, I should have the right.

56
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:53,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's a thought, I don't know, maybe filter the obscenities.

57
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that's so hard.

58
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:59,225
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's stupid is what it is.

59
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:08,490
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely stupid that you should jump through all these hoops to just friggin' play the game with your friends, and then after all that stuff, why even include text chat?

60
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,811
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, basically, as so they can put a big sticker on the box, supports online chat.

61
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:23,012
[SPEAKER_03]: As to, yeah, IGN did a report on this, and basically, you know, selected limited selections, automated statements, or responses while playing the game.

62
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:26,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hello, I'm sad, I'd say welcome, you know.

63
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:32,759
[SPEAKER_03]: RossDLUT asks, and yes, this time it is RossDLUT, asks in chat room, why even make the stupid game online?

64
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, for me, it's kind of like the DS games.

65
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:40,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how often do you go on a DS game and somebody is already there online waiting for you?

66
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:41,104
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't happen.

67
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:45,667
[SPEAKER_03]: You prearrange those matches over the internet on AIM, or you prearrange them over the telephone.

68
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:50,871
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking, fire up, guys, there's voice chat.

69
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's another thought, and this is the kind of,

70
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XI

71
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:28,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, supporting that feature, because this may be also the chat with the other people, not necessarily your friends that you're playing with as well.

72
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:35,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish they would also have normal chatting in there as well on top of this stuff, but whatever.

73
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:48,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the Justin TV chat for a minute and usually I don't take a chance to read it, but our old buddy Akuma JP is in there and says, type while driving better.

74
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:52,885
[SPEAKER_03]: As if talking on your cell phone while driving wasn't bad enough, now you can type while driving.

75
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:57,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, well, it's a wee remote, you know, you really only need one hand to kind of do that.

76
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:00,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I put on my makeup while I drive too?

77
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

78
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that'd be an awesome one.

79
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:12,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Woman driver of the game.

80
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:15,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, drag queen driver.

81
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:16,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's better.

82
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:20,418
[SPEAKER_04]: That has to be kind of hot.

83
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:24,019
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to put on your makeup and your stilettos while you're trying to drive.

84
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Put on your furry costume on the way there.

85
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And change the radio.

86
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Mr. DJ.

87
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:30,861
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

88
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:32,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we move on, please?

89
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:33,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

90
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:42,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something that is actually fairly cool about Mario Kart Wii is that there is an 8-finger fast mode, which is pretty cool.

91
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:46,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it looks like you'll be able to...

92
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for Mario Kart.

93
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more excited about this game than Brawl.

94
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:54,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

95
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm not really into the fighting games.

96
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:01,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart, I love Mario Kart.

97
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:05,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought every game system or every Nintendo system for Mario Kart.

98
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:05,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, even Double Dash?

99
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:19,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I even bought Double Dash.

100
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:21,722
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you like Double Dash?

101
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:23,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

102
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:27,543
[SPEAKER_03]: The Battle Mode in Double Dash really sucks balls, but, you know.

103
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sorry, Jamie, but what do you think of 8-Player Battle Mode?

104
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:32,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is that a game-selling thing for you, or?

105
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:40,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was probably going to get it anyway, but I think that that's very cool, especially since I know enough people who have a Wii to facilitate that much play.

106
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:43,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish it would, you know.

107
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:46,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking what you could do is have a laptop in with Ventriload.

108
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:49,135
[SPEAKER_04]: and then do your snack talking.

109
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:50,636
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

110
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:55,478
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I don't, like, for me, my computer is all the way out here in the dungeon, a.k.a.

111
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:56,518
[SPEAKER_03]: garage, a.k.a.

112
00:08:56,678 --> 00:09:00,219
[SPEAKER_03]: OLR makeshift studio, and then the Wii is all the way in there.

113
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't really do that.

114
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just here for myself.

115
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got my laptop.

116
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your MacBook.

117
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:05,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

118
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:27,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you come over and set that all up?

119
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:29,110
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too many wires.

120
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:34,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I can get the Best Buy people to install it for me.

121
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:36,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I wanted to do.

122
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:37,496
[SPEAKER_03]: You were like, huh?

123
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:39,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we cover that story?

124
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:40,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it got cut from the show.

125
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:50,086
[SPEAKER_03]: At Best Buy, there was a sticker on an Xbox 360 game that said, have Geek Squad install this game on your Xbox 360.

126
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:50,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that.

127
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:58,567
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just somebody got sticker happy and put stickers on the wrong things.

128
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:01,950
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

129
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:08,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Eject, put the game in, drop it down, push eject button again, game goes in.

130
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:09,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that'll be $50.

131
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:11,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

132
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:17,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, maybe the PlayStation 3 installation, that might be something because it takes so long for some of those games.

133
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:21,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well we'll be battling it out.

134
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:22,848
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my full cry.

135
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:32,188
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a game that I played a while back, and I think maybe during one of these shows back at our old apartment we were off, but it's a game called Defend Your Castle.

136
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:40,709
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little flash game where you defend your castle against stick figures, and you get archers and all sorts of things to defend them.

137
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:47,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, basically what you do is you use your mouse to throw the stick figures away to keep them away from your castle.

138
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:52,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now this is going to be coming to the WiiWare service as well.

139
00:10:53,374 --> 00:11:00,247
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually going to be completely from the ground up, and it's only $5 for 500 Wii Points, which is pretty awesome.

140
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:04,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they've built some new features into it as well.

141
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, unlimited levels.

142
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:13,226
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

143
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:15,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I love games like that.

144
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:18,168
[SPEAKER_03]: The old school Atari 2600 games never ended.

145
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:18,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Kaboom.

146
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't end until something was Kaboom.

147
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:23,450
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no ending.

148
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It was going faster.

149
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,851
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

150
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:34,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Another game that they've already announced coming to the service a while back was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles My Life as a

151
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:56,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Wee Point, and we'll be joining some other games as well, including, of course, Defender, Castle, and this one didn't make the list, but the major league eating the game, which looks like a piece of shit, and that will be But that's not what you're eating.

152
00:11:56,602 --> 00:12:00,384
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not a piece of shit that you're eating, but the game looks like looks like pooey.

153
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Like dump on your wee.

154
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,427
[SPEAKER_03]: No one likes dump on their wee.

155
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:08,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard poo like an adjective, but there you go.

156
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:10,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's coming out May

157
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:18,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that, but they need to figure out something with the whole Wii memory shit.

158
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:19,904
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you can put these on

159
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:43,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to think that maybe they can do an upgrade right when the WiiWare comes out and then you can start using flashcards, but who knows.

160
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:50,468
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that Nintendo can get right, though, is the peripherals, I mean, they will crank out those Wii wheels for Mario Kart.

161
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:56,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, though, that's kind of weird, is that it will actually be sold separately other places.

162
00:12:56,492 --> 00:13:03,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Famitsu over in Japan has revealed that Nintendo is going to be selling the Wii wheels separately for about $11.

163
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:11,063
[SPEAKER_03]: No word yet if we're going to get that separately as well, but you know that if Nintendo doesn't officially put them out themselves, which they probably will,

164
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:14,245
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have third-party developers of the Wazoo doing this.

165
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:19,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it does kind of make sense to have the separate Wii wheels because, you know, the same reason you have separate DDR pads.

166
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:20,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you want to play two-player.

167
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:25,173
[SPEAKER_03]: They will be coming out separately here at the same time as Mario Kart.

168
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:25,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

169
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:26,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

170
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:27,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know this to be fact.

171
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:28,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

172
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you have it then.

173
00:13:30,297 --> 00:13:34,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same reason why because little Screaming Billy wants fucking, you know, his own wheel.

174
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,102
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't want to share it with his sister or something like that.

175
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:38,743
[SPEAKER_03]: He has to buy two fucking plastic wheels.

176
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:43,248
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just plastic wheels, folks, and seriously, you can buy them now.

177
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:48,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just third-party things, and it's completely, absolutely useless.

178
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you don't need this thing to play the game.

179
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:50,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this.

180
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,650
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my favorite comment in a while.

181
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob says, guys, save that the DDR pad has functionality and the Wii is a dumbass wheel.

182
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Touche.

183
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:04,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Touche.

184
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:07,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like the fact that this game controls with as many

185
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:22,279
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTsuyu says, I wish there was a wheel that let the Wiimote fit vertically so I could use it on Need for Speed Carbon.

186
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the thing, too.

187
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,701
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing that pisses me off about this game.

188
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:35,265
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've ever played one of these games that uses the wheels sideways like Mario Kart does or like, say, like some of these other games that use the wheels, it's really

189
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,485
[SPEAKER_03]: In related news, I still kinda like Excite Truck.

190
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:44,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And they need to fucking make a new one!

191
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:03,449
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife has finished the game.

192
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:07,591
[SPEAKER_03]: For the love of God, give Loki's wife a game to get excited about.

193
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Make poor tracks if you don't want to make a new game.

194
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:11,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

195
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:14,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I will buy them for whatever price you want to charge.

196
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:15,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need some more Excite Trucks.

197
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:18,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to have to buy Motorstorm 2.

198
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:19,776
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 wasn't very impressive.

199
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,216
[SPEAKER_03]: That and custom soundtrack.

200
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:23,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Excite Truck was kind of neat.

201
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:34,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I can understand Excite Truck, that's fine, because that game really does need custom soundtracks, but Endless Ocean, what the fuck?

202
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:36,489
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need custom soundtracks in that game.

203
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:39,952
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't swim through the ocean and rob zombies.

204
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,773
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not right.

205
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:41,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too slow.

206
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Excite Truck is fucking awesome.

207
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:48,941
[SPEAKER_04]: You could play through Excite Truck for the multi, not only the long.

208
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's funny, but you know what?

209
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:11,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I hear a Justin Timberlake song now, I think of Excite Truck, and, you know, I used to play it to, like, you know, really cool shit.

210
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:13,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that thing is hilarious, that commercial.

211
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:14,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I don't know.

212
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:36,827
[SPEAKER_04]: What if they were to do, like, a different type of vehicle for an Excite something game?

213
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:38,768
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as they just say, I don't care.

214
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:40,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Excite Boat.

215
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:41,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Excite ATV.

216
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,530
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be Moon Frasier.

217
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:43,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.

218
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Excite ATV on the Moon.

219
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:48,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they didn't have a space level.

220
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,092
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember Nebula?

221
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:50,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's true.

222
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:53,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, okay.

223
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:59,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we've turned in our most current news thing about Mario Kart Wii into Excite Truck Remedy thing somehow, so

224
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:11,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some Wii-related stuff, only it's more for a virtual console, and specifically for our friends in the UK.

225
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:24,127
[SPEAKER_04]: The games that are coming out this week from HAL region is Super Turrican, that was the Super Nintendo game, and Psychosis, that was on the TurboGrafx-16.

226
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:27,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Factor 5 made Super Turrican.

227
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 800 points.

228
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It uses the classic and GameCube controller in Psychosis.

229
00:17:32,173 --> 00:17:40,195
[SPEAKER_04]: It's set under B-Point and it also uses the classic and cube heads and also uses the V-Mode.

230
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:46,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And for anyone who hasn't heard of Psychosis, because I know that TurboGrafx tends to be on the obscure end, it's a side-scrolling shooter.

231
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:54,199
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also position satellites around your ship and kill stuff with them.

232
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing with satellites is awesome.

233
00:17:58,301 --> 00:17:59,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray, killing!

234
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:07,919
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't want to mod your Wii, there are other options now for you to be able to play in-court games.

235
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:16,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to the freeloader, of course you may remember that from the GameCube as being able to play wonderful in-court games then.

236
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:21,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Kojilskis is now offering a freeloader for the Wii.

237
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,127
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to do a bunch of other things, though.

238
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:25,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be for $19.99 in the U.S., U.K.

239
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:27,109
[SPEAKER_03]: for $9.99 pounds, I believe.

240
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:34,587
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's going to allow a couple different things to happen.

241
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:39,971
[SPEAKER_03]: One, it will stop any updates that are on the game disc so you don't end up with duplicate channels.

242
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,353
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you import stuff, that's kind of what happens.

243
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:44,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big deal, but annoying.

244
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:56,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will also be kind of invisible to your console so that, you know, they hope that there will be no updates to destroy it like they did with the GameCube one.

245
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:04,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It is available now, and hopefully it won't be broken soon.

246
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:21,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we had a little bit of controversy last week, and I'm sure it's going to continue on into our Mailbag and Skype segments this week, but would you say there is a legitimate, non-shady purpose for this?

247
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:29,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Like on my GameCube, I had Phil Caliber 2, and I also had one of the Battletoe Fighters.

248
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,343
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, back before they decided to release them, all of them over here.

249
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:58,027
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if this was more like, you know, the DS or something like that, where it was region-free, I think you'd see a lot more people buying games for other reasons, you know.

250
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:07,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my crowd, or here's my question to the crowd, about, you know, because we had kind of two different, very opposite sides talking about whole modding and all that stuff last week.

251
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:16,134
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, to the people that are not, that do not support mod chips and piracy and all that stuff, is the freeloader ethical?

252
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:17,492
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my question.

253
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:18,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of curious.

254
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:20,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are you okay with the freeloader?

255
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing that there is a very legitimate purpose to it.

256
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think so because you can't pirate games with it.

257
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:26,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay.

258
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:33,381
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as far as we're aware, I mean, you can't pirate games with it, but... Is it one of those it's just a matter of time things?

259
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:34,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

260
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:41,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, with the freeloader, I mean, I don't think... He can change the region on it, so... Who knows?

261
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:45,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because it's obviously tricking the console into thinking something that, you know...

262
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:57,938
[SPEAKER_03]: My thing would be, like I said, you know, because now we're getting these staggered release dates, you know, like Mario Kart in the UK is coming out, you know, a couple weeks before, you know, the US release.

263
00:20:58,018 --> 00:21:02,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you really wanted to, you could actually get that name early in English and be able to play it.

264
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments from chat.

265
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Ross DLUT says, well, if you can't pirate games, then by all means.

266
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:09,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of Dad says, yes, I just want to play the games.

267
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:12,824
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Janai says, yes, I want to play all games no matter what.

268
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:28,297
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another thing, too, that actually was mentioned on the blurb on the freeloader sales area, was that for people who have non-region systems, that this is a way to play local games.

269
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:32,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I've, you know, I actually have key friends who, you know,

270
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:33,699
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

271
00:21:52,182 --> 00:22:06,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing some feedback with some of our listeners, because I know we have a lot of listeners that are into import gaming, because we're one of the fewer gaming podcasts that actually cover kind of the import scene outside of just America, so I'm kind of curious what one of our listeners, some of our listeners should use this.

272
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you getting one, Loki, or are you not bothering to get one?

273
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:13,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not bothering, but I have a bodship, so... DarkSakura, you are thinking of getting one, right?

274
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:15,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to get one next payday.

275
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:16,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you think.

276
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because, I mean, there's... I don't have any import games, because that's not except for my game people.

277
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:21,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for borrowing this match, brother.

278
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get into import games enough to get one.

279
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:33,017
[SPEAKER_03]: The only import game I've ever really gone crazy for was BVNia 2DX.

280
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:40,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I said you forget crazy all the time on PS2, but you know, even a little quick thing is, you know I had to get Bust Move back in the day.

281
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:42,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I actually had a Japanese PlayStation 2.

282
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I still do.

283
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:43,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if it worked.

284
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:45,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Japanese Dreamcast.

285
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:51,693
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason I decided that Wangan Midnight for the PS3, that was a mistake, and I thought, I won't import any more PS3 games.

286
00:22:51,713 --> 00:22:52,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it not good?

287
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:54,035
[SPEAKER_03]: It was shit.

288
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:55,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it play?

289
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I played this fine.

290
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:58,984
[SPEAKER_03]: We've played Region 3 here, Region 3, so.

291
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:02,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow.

292
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:06,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on, because speaking of the mailbag, I know we want to get there, and it's coming right up.

293
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:11,877
[SPEAKER_03]: But real quick, I want to give you one more Wii story, and that's about Wii Fit.

294
00:23:12,698 --> 00:23:14,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Fit has been given a price in Europe.

295
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,963
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to buy the game in the UK, it's going to be $50.

296
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking, I'm thinking, um...

297
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:48,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

298
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:07,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd buy that for $89.99.

299
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:09,323
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, anyhow.

300
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:15,205
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, in Europe, unfortunately, you are paying more for games usually.

301
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:20,226
[SPEAKER_03]: So while we might get it for $89.99, might get it for $89.99, we possibly will get it for $89.99.

302
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:25,087
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys will have to pay $89.99, which is considerably more.

303
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:28,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to break it to you.

304
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:30,029
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

305
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:32,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's open up the old mailbag.

306
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:37,121
[SPEAKER_03]: We love to hear from our listeners, and every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelongradio.com.

307
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:43,203
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura likes to dive in the mailbag headfirst and pull out some of her favorite emails, and she's going to read them right now.

308
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:44,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my snorkel ready.

309
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And your rubber glove?

310
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm wearing a snorkel.

311
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:53,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in case it's by Ambrex.

312
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:56,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, can I draw?

313
00:24:58,152 --> 00:25:00,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have, well, no, no, no, no, no, I have something far better.

314
00:25:01,094 --> 00:25:04,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about bad 80s bands, not the, uh... I like Anthrax!

315
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:06,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sorry.

316
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:10,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, Anthrax and Public Enemy is like the best combination ever, hi!

317
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:20,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of great bands of the past, do you know what band really needs to, I've decided after all the commercials on TV, do you know what band really needs to come to Rock Band?

318
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:35,046
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to see the Lost Odyssey commercial with the White Rabbit music, it's pretty awesome

319
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,232
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why we don't have text chat in Mario Kart.

320
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:22,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering what other good games are on there that I should get.

321
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks guys, you get me through the week.

322
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you did not get Super Metroid!

323
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:25,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it!

324
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:51,462
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was Alien Crush, sorry.

325
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:53,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Guardian, or Gunstar Heroes.

326
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:54,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Gunstar Heroes, Alien Crush.

327
00:26:54,985 --> 00:26:56,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your list needs more Sega.

328
00:26:57,547 --> 00:26:59,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there was not enough Sega in the list.

329
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:01,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there more like 3 hours?

330
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, I think they all are.

331
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:05,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart, 64.

332
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:08,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario 64.

333
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:11,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Mario Kart, like, yeah, there's another Mario Kart.

334
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:13,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I bet there's something more Mario Kart we've got here.

335
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:15,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.

336
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want Super Metroid now?

337
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:24,820
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, chat room wanted to see if you would get this reference.

338
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:29,384
The bass line is opening the...

339
00:27:56,648 --> 00:28:01,772
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't really like that song.

340
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:03,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does have a sweet bass word.

341
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:05,876
[SPEAKER_04]: The bass word is what made me think of that word, actually.

342
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:06,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

343
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:16,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I did just see this really awful band, and we went outside, and their bass line, it was a band called 8-Bit.

344
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:18,106
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't very good.

345
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,688
[SPEAKER_04]: They were rapping, wearing hazmat suits.

346
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:27,917
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were coming back from drinking at the Pyramid across the street.

347
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:30,119
[SPEAKER_04]: This is at the Gilman in Berkeley.

348
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:34,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And we came back and stood outside and their bass line was the Legend of Zelda theme.

349
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Their bass line was.

350
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:39,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

351
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:40,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

352
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:40,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

353
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:43,470
[SPEAKER_04]: They were awful, though.

354
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was awful.

355
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:48,994
[SPEAKER_04]: But Babyland played that show, so Babyland, Ricky, did the whole thing.

356
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:49,455
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

357
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:50,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

358
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:58,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it seems like there's some head tracking popping up lately in console world.

359
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:06,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone keeps looking at Sony One at GEC and I'm surprised nobody knows what the track are that's been going around for years.

360
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:08,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one and it works great.

361
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It is only for the PC though.

362
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:15,432
[SPEAKER_04]: It has six degrees of movement and you can use it as

363
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:20,226
[SPEAKER_04]: A mouse control that you can use with any game that doesn't have direct support for the track IR.

364
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:23,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really huge for racing and flight games.

365
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:29,549
[SPEAKER_04]: There is one FPS game that it does support, and that's from Pendragon.

366
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:33,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess this game should be used for Marvel Madness.

367
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah, that's a game we need to do.

368
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:38,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even better, to watch

369
00:29:51,287 --> 00:30:09,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, DarkSakura, and Skye, with regards to the call in last episode about system hacking, I have to comment, true, if there was some of the content that it hacked from or allows you to play games without paying for them, even though this can be seen as wrong, I think that it's kind of funny that they can do this in the first place.

370
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:15,369
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the firmware is better than the proper firmware.

371
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:24,155
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, a Skype program is only for thin TFCs if they can get to work on 6 TFCs more power to them, as it is more fair if everything works on those systems.

372
00:30:24,816 --> 00:30:29,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if they can get 3 games that people make to work as cool as handmade games are good.

373
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:36,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I also believe that if you do stop talking about hacks, then you would miss out on a huge part of the gaming world.

374
00:30:36,395 --> 00:30:39,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just saying this only as a reply to the call, I know you won't.

375
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:47,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, you often talk about how the PlayStation 3 is a giant letdown, but I have to say this

376
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:58,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Fearplay, that there are a lot more games in the Xbox 360, but I am the only person in my group of friends to have a PS3, and I will think every single one of the others' Xboxes have three rings at one point or the other.

377
00:31:00,184 --> 00:31:03,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, keep up the good show and help Sky feel better, like Anna.

378
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:05,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

379
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:06,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I am feeling better.

380
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:18,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you do bring up an issue about the whole, you know, the firmwares definitely do serve a legitimate purpose.

381
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:24,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's how kind of a lot of people get away with this and get them to the radar because there is a legitimate purpose for a lot of this.

382
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:27,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it just becomes a moral issue about how you choose to use it.

383
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:49,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you choose to use it to get Skype on your PSP, which is free anyway, that whole thing, you know, I don't think that's as big of a moral problem, so to speak, as, you know, getting this on there so you can hacksore all the NES games from your past, or, you know, better yet, download all the PlayStation 1 games you always wanted to play and all that, or PSP games.

384
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:53,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's just a moral question.

385
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:55,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying one's right or wrong, because there's a lot, you know,

386
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,080
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people steal music like there's no tomorrow.

387
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:08,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a lot of legitimate things that they've started in homebrew that I think Sony has saw and they're like, hey, let's throw that into an official release.

388
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, internet streaming radio.

389
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:16,256
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been available on the homebrew scene for a long time now.

390
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:20,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they, what, last up, they finally implemented some of that stuff.

391
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:23,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

392
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,561
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff that comes out there.

393
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:28,162
[SPEAKER_03]: They have YouTube stuff that you can view now straight on your PSP.

394
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:36,965
[SPEAKER_03]: They had stuff that hooked up to your GPS a while back, even before they had the GPS for the PSP.

395
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:37,825
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff.

396
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:39,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're coming out with purple.

397
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:41,946
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like tilt-centered stuff at Chromebook.

398
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:44,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you have the force.

399
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:47,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your choice if you wish to choose to turn to the dark side.

400
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:48,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

401
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,448
All right.

402
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:51,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email?

403
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:51,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

404
00:32:52,694 --> 00:32:56,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey OLR Crew, I was just emailing to give my side of the modding talk.

405
00:32:56,736 --> 00:33:06,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I was apparently crucified simply for asking about the illegitimate question by Rosso UT Hold up, is this the email, this is the one that Rosso UT had called in to respond to last week, same person, I'm assuming?

406
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, yeah.

407
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:12,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, yeah, yeah.

408
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:14,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just curious, just wanted to get that out there.

409
00:33:16,108 --> 00:33:21,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because he doesn't agree with modding, modchips are part of gaming culture and community just because they can

410
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:23,033
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I do?

411
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:23,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, whatever.

412
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he must have typed this immediately.

413
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,262
[SPEAKER_03]: He probably typed this right as he was listening to the call.

414
00:33:48,602 --> 00:33:50,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So, give it a little flex.

415
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:55,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of the people who did mod are people who sit behind our computers wearing ski masks trying to steal games from the internet.

416
00:33:56,387 --> 00:34:01,570
[SPEAKER_04]: People back up their DVDs and music CDs, so I've seen their reason why it's such a gray area when it comes to games.

417
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:09,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people use modchips to preserve their investments, others are interested in the technical aspect of it, and yet they are a group who simply wish to steal games.

418
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:16,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I like hearing Loki's talk about him trying to fix his 360 and all the modifications he does to it, along with his V-Mod.

419
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,282
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just part of gaming culture, and I'm glad OLR doesn't filter topics like this.

420
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:24,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish that someone would jump down the throat for people who are interested in modding.

421
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:29,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time my $50 game gets destroyed out of my hands, I'll send you anti-modder for the bill.

422
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:32,204
[SPEAKER_04]: and Loki, you helped me a lot with your tips.

423
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:36,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my chip successfully installed so no more coasters for me.

424
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:36,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Epic win.

425
00:34:36,946 --> 00:34:38,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you feel better this week, Rob.

426
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:43,509
[SPEAKER_04]: This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.

427
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,311
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have Olive Garden night pretty soon.

428
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:48,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some real Italian food for once.

429
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:50,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, though.

430
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:54,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I can actually go to the Olive Garden.

431
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I just ate there a couple days ago.

432
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the deal.

433
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:07,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally agree with what he's saying about that it is a part of gaming culture and that's what we're all about.

434
00:35:07,414 --> 00:35:08,655
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we need to cover it on the show.

435
00:35:09,435 --> 00:35:13,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he made some good points.

436
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:14,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the cog made some good points.

437
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:16,539
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

438
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:34,055
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

439
00:35:57,737 --> 00:36:24,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I don't know, kind of taking it a step further, as long as this stuff continues, it's going to be interesting because I think the game industry has the potential to turn into almost kind of what the music industry is doing, where I think especially through things, that's why I said last week, I think that XNA thing is such huge news, because I think in the future you're going to start seeing a lot more download your games onto the, you know, and indie developers making things in-house that you download, you know, just kind of like music is turning into, where, you know, in

440
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:27,035
[SPEAKER_03]: More stuff is getting out there because of iTunes and stuff.

441
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,599
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, I think we're about five, maybe even ten years away from that.

442
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:33,702
[SPEAKER_03]: But, anyhow, that's my ramble.

443
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my little ramble.

444
00:36:37,886 --> 00:36:38,947
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no easy solution.

445
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,990
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing any of us are going to say that's going to please both sides of it.

446
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, though, we're doing a disservice by ignoring it.

447
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:48,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So, ignoring it's not going to make it go away.

448
00:36:48,693 --> 00:36:53,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, personally, I have no problem with that, that someone wants to do.

449
00:36:53,095 --> 00:36:56,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not my place to tell anybody what they can or can't do.

450
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:59,938
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just up to them if they want to deal with the consequences of being caught.

451
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:01,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and here's one thing.

452
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:01,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Realize

453
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:08,560
[SPEAKER_03]: At any time, one of these companies may come up with a magic patch that's going to nerf your Wii if you mod it.

454
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be no choice.

455
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,981
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to install the thing to play the latest game or something.

456
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:15,601
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not just going to render the game in Apple.

457
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:17,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to completely nerf your freaking Wii.

458
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:19,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Your freaking iPhone.

459
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:19,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

460
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:21,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Your freaking iPhone and all that stuff.

461
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the chance you take.

462
00:37:23,403 --> 00:37:24,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday your thing is going to get bricked.

463
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:28,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's the chance you took.

464
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:29,144
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

465
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:30,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

466
00:37:31,212 --> 00:37:31,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary Allen.

467
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:32,714
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

468
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:35,056
[SPEAKER_04]: For me.

469
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:35,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email.

470
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:37,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Skye, Loki, and DarkSakura.

471
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:42,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm emailing on behalf of the semi-obliterated PS2 sitting in a bag in my room.

472
00:37:42,924 --> 00:37:50,632
[SPEAKER_04]: The other day I arrived at school suspecting it would be like any other day when one of my friends informed me in his wisdom that the PS2 stopped working the previous afternoon.

473
00:37:50,712 --> 00:37:53,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, he took a hammer to the case and smashed it open.

474
00:37:54,329 --> 00:38:05,113
[SPEAKER_04]: The irony here is that before the fan had only chipped a few teeth, and now the cage is bent forward, the metal things on the inside are bent and the laser may be broken, but I'm not sure, and one of the ribbons has been damaged.

475
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:13,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I've taken the console from him, and I was just wondering whether any of you know a good site that I could get spare parts from, and particularly if Loki knew a fairer way to test the laser.

476
00:38:14,197 --> 00:38:15,638
[SPEAKER_04]: With love, Heart's Lonely Nagel.

477
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:19,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can order replacement parts from Tony.

478
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:21,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you could for the older stuff, huh?

479
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can still order stuff from him.

480
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:32,872
[SPEAKER_03]: but I was going to say, I don't know, the only way to test the laser I would think is to put a game in it and actually test it.

481
00:38:33,632 --> 00:38:38,354
[SPEAKER_03]: For spare parts though, you might be able to check out llama.com.

482
00:38:38,454 --> 00:38:41,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten some Xbox 360 mod stuff from there.

483
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:44,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they carry Playstation 2 stuff anymore, I think they do.

484
00:38:46,217 --> 00:38:53,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have like official, I'm sorry, did they have like official Sony repair centers like they have for some other types of products?

485
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:56,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, maybe there's a place you can take your PS2 and get just the laser thingy tweaked?

486
00:38:57,638 --> 00:38:58,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, maybe.

487
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't know.

488
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,820
[SPEAKER_03]: How old, I'm sorry, I might have missed it.

489
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,361
[SPEAKER_03]: How old did you say the PlayStation 2 was?

490
00:39:04,381 --> 00:39:05,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say it was like an old school one?

491
00:39:06,442 --> 00:39:07,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, maybe they did not say.

492
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:19,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if it's one of the old school, you know, huge, uh, you know, PlayStation 2s, the old model, it might just be time, because obviously by the time you fix some of this stuff, you're practically paying what you pay for a PS2 mini.

493
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:22,049
[SPEAKER_04]: People put broken ones on eBay, though, too, don't they?

494
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:22,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

495
00:39:23,735 --> 00:39:32,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can, I mean, they're kind of getting cheap now, and you can probably find a cheap PS2 for, you know, nothing.

496
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:36,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... Let's test the theory.

497
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:42,929
[SPEAKER_03]: If the system isn't too bashed up, you can get it fixed at www.oldschoolgamer.ca, but that indicates it's Canadian.

498
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:44,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that would work.

499
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:48,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an example.

500
00:39:49,394 --> 00:39:52,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Your cables and stuff, your ribbon cables, those are about $10,

501
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:55,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then the lens is about $40.

502
00:39:56,433 --> 00:40:00,957
[SPEAKER_03]: So right there at $50 is half the price of your PS2, mine is $5.

503
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:07,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm looking on, um, GameStop's website, and I need, I don't know, we can go and buy from GameStop.

504
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:17,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but the, um, the, the, uh, old style PS2 refurb is $79.99, so the new style is $99.99.

505
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:23,234
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and you'll, and if you find them at just the used ones, they'll be cheaper than that.

506
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,191
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of that is pointing out that Target was actually having a sale on PS2s last week for 99 new.

507
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:34,173
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there you go.

508
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep an eye on those websites.

509
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:38,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that's not the answer you wanted to hear that we're telling you.

510
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:40,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, go buy a new PS2.

511
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:46,517
[SPEAKER_03]: But keep an eye on those websites like CheapAssGamer and some of those other video game deals websites too.

512
00:40:46,537 --> 00:40:48,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Once in a while something might pop up there.

513
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:49,318
[SPEAKER_03]: So, always keep an eye on it.

514
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:52,139
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do want to get your old system fixed,

515
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:56,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there are ways that you might have to have a professional step in, or you're gonna void your warranty.

516
00:40:57,009 --> 00:40:59,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It just might as well at this point just to buy a new one.

517
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:04,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a point you gotta say, well, it's expensive to fix it, just buy a new one.

518
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,992
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, Ross, CLUT, and Chaperones have a good point.

519
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:10,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what if he's a Final Fantasy XI player, then EPS2 won't support the HDD.

520
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:12,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Then buy an older one.

521
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,054
[SPEAKER_03]: And quit Final Fantasy XI.

522
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:15,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

523
00:41:15,495 --> 00:41:16,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

524
00:41:17,495 --> 00:41:18,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, you gotta go with PC version.

525
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, sorry.

526
00:41:19,656 --> 00:41:20,076
[SPEAKER_03]: More email?

527
00:41:20,954 --> 00:41:25,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I was a controller player on this game.

528
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:27,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you even play that game on controller.

529
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:27,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Just call me Joy.

530
00:41:27,796 --> 00:41:32,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I just, and it was designed for controllers, the hilarious thing, but I cannot play that game on anything but a keyboard.

531
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:34,339
[SPEAKER_04]: The macros are so easy with triggers.

532
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:35,219
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really easy.

533
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:35,739
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.

534
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:36,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, hang on.

535
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:39,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, hey everyone, before I begin, there's a couple things I must say.

536
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,121
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, hail Jamie Worship.

537
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:41,901
Yes.

538
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:42,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is this?

539
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:43,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Baja.

540
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:44,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

541
00:41:45,122 --> 00:41:46,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got me some new shoes.

542
00:41:47,223 --> 00:41:47,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

543
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:54,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, I want to say that I look forward to each episode of Sunday Night and the podcasts that get me through my daily commute to and from work.

544
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:57,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that the formalities are out of the way, just let me say this.

545
00:41:58,465 --> 00:42:06,713
[SPEAKER_04]: As I listen to Roscoe UT's Thoughts on Mining, I can tell that you, Rob, weren't too happy about that.

546
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:08,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell in your voice that you...

547
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:11,174
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't that happy about that.

548
00:42:11,534 --> 00:42:15,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just say that my PS2 has been modded for three plus years.

549
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: During that time, I have over a thousand dollars worth of bootleg games.

550
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

551
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Simply put, I do not have the money to shell out each week to buy these titles.

552
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:24,203
[SPEAKER_04]: But all isn't lost.

553
00:42:24,443 --> 00:42:29,847
[SPEAKER_04]: On the positive side, playing copied games allowed me the chance to play and try out some of the games and see if I like it.

554
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:34,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, no one here wants to drop 40 bucks on a PS2 game and find out later that the game sucks and it's a waste.

555
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:38,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a modded console allows me to check out imported games as well.

556
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:46,170
[SPEAKER_04]: When I write this, I tend to think of myself as a hypocrite because my real substance is to fix some computers with bootleg software.

557
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:58,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell customers not to use bootleg enterprise corporate software as well as software that belongs to a friend of theirs, but alas, some will not listen, and unlike also UT, I do not take this to heart.

558
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:01,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, I do not see a problem with modding consoles.

559
00:43:01,618 --> 00:43:07,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Mods allow us to break things with consoles, not just copies slash burned games.

560
00:43:08,197 --> 00:43:12,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if I download a game that's really good and I would go out and buy it, case in point, Kingdom Hearts 2.

561
00:43:12,802 --> 00:43:21,651
[SPEAKER_04]: As a friend who is in the gaming industry that gives me grief about copy games, to say that, I say to her, are you going to buy me this game?

562
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:22,211
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're not.

563
00:43:22,272 --> 00:43:24,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I want to see if the game is actually worth buying.

564
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:26,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it is, I'll buy it.

565
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:27,677
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, leave me be.

566
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:30,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall,

567
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:32,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Roughly Pete, shut up.

568
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:34,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave us modders alone.

569
00:43:34,128 --> 00:43:36,530
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not damaging the gaming industry at all.

570
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:42,916
[SPEAKER_04]: From my knowledge, there's no proof of that as either.

571
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:52,304
[SPEAKER_03]: There's usually what it comes down to, and this is the same argument with MP3 downloading and stuff like that, is everyone... That's the recycle thing.

572
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:53,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the recycle.

573
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:54,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not that.

574
00:43:54,326 --> 00:43:55,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people...

575
00:43:56,892 --> 00:44:02,394
[SPEAKER_03]: The industry doesn't actually lose money from these people because these people are never going to buy the product in the first place.

576
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:05,955
[SPEAKER_03]: So you didn't miss out on a sale because they were never going to buy it.

577
00:44:05,995 --> 00:44:09,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with people downloading import games or something like that.

578
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:10,636
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't going to buy it in the first place.

579
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:16,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So the modern thinking is it's not going to hurt anybody.

580
00:44:16,298 --> 00:44:21,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously, still, they could import it and spend the money and do that kind of stuff.

581
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:22,940
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

582
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,801
[SPEAKER_03]: It's immoral, maybe.

583
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:28,864
[SPEAKER_03]: is it really hurting the industry?

584
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:45,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, not quite, I don't know, I mean stuff like say for example a lot of people are burning copies of Halo 3 or something like that, yeah that's going to hurt the sales of that game, especially if they were intending on buying it in the first place, I don't know.

585
00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:48,563
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why a lot of companies

586
00:45:00,525 --> 00:45:08,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's another thing, maybe, you know, people will respect your games more, like, you know, stop putting out shovelware.

587
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:09,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at you, Destineer.

588
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:20,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and just to address the part of the letter that talked about me, uh, getting kind of, um, I don't know what he said about the call, but I was... He didn't seem happy about it.

589
00:45:20,183 --> 00:45:21,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't seem happy about it.

590
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:25,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, well, A, I was sick last week, so cut me some slack, and so that kind of, um,

591
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Lens My Sense of Professionalism

592
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:49,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of knew.

593
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:53,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's interesting in a way, it's part of the charm of the show.

594
00:45:53,632 --> 00:46:01,978
[SPEAKER_03]: We open up the sky's line, anybody can call about anything, you don't know what it's going to be, and we're going to deal with it and talk about it on air.

595
00:46:02,078 --> 00:46:03,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of part of what makes the show unique.

596
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:09,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But when the call came in, I kind of knew that it was opening a can of worms, and that's why I wasn't happy.

597
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:13,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I wasn't happy with the opinion or whatever, I wasn't happy because I was just kind of like...

598
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:18,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy, I know there's going to be emails on this next week, and probably some more calls later on tonight.

599
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:24,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this was an epic battle I was awaiting.

600
00:46:26,337 --> 00:46:28,038
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of this email.

601
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:37,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for reading my letter on air, and Rob, I apologize for using your show to call out a fellow OLR listener, but I do not reject and allow a travesty of a comment of rawful UT's to go by unnoticed.

602
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:40,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock on and have a most triumphant week.

603
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:41,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It's DJ Ranma S. P.S.

604
00:46:42,354 --> 00:46:47,897
[SPEAKER_04]: If roughly you two want to comment back, by all means, my email, Addie, is listed, and I guess you can P.S.

605
00:46:48,077 --> 00:46:48,237
[SPEAKER_04]: me.

606
00:46:48,257 --> 00:46:49,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're both in chat right now.

607
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:50,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Hug it out, boys.

608
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:51,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Hug it out.

609
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:54,461
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wants me to plug his podcast, so I am.

610
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:55,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fair enough.

611
00:46:55,982 --> 00:47:00,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Anime Jam Session at DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam.

612
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:05,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Go listen to it, but not right now, because we're live.

613
00:47:05,388 --> 00:47:05,588
All right.

614
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:08,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other emails, or was that it?

615
00:47:08,149 --> 00:47:08,589
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more.

616
00:47:08,789 --> 00:47:11,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dang, we've got talent emails tonight.

617
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:11,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

618
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,451
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get through them.

619
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:15,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, OLR crew, I have a question for DarkSakura.

620
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:16,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, cool.

621
00:47:17,072 --> 00:47:22,055
[SPEAKER_04]: You said months ago that you put Pump Up the Volume on hold after your laptop got fried.

622
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:23,595
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was after my PC got fried.

623
00:47:24,236 --> 00:47:25,156
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that coming along?

624
00:47:25,216 --> 00:47:27,697
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be great to listen to Pump Up the Volume again someday.

625
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:32,179
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice break from what the 24-7 stream provides on GS68.

626
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, there's progress in this today.

627
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:47,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a computer that I could use, but the problem is that I want something with a bit more on the graphic capabilities side, just for the sake of all the other projects I do.

628
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:53,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have been using my laptop, but my laptop likes to run really friggin' slow.

629
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm actually going to replace all the memory in it.

630
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:04,908
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have gutted out one of the VAIOs sitting in our garage.

631
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:21,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And although one of them is promised, that sort of leaves the other one up in the air because it might be promised as well, we are looking into putting a VAMP graphics card in it, my old hard drive, basically building a frankie-cooter for me.

632
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:25,943
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't, you know, what my old computer was, sort of a Frankenstein of parts, but...

633
00:48:26,764 --> 00:48:30,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Pump Up the Volume, it all goes to plan.

634
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:35,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for a return of Pump Up the Volume soon.

635
00:48:36,134 --> 00:48:42,641
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'm also going back to college, which I don't know if I've mentioned to my co-hosts here.

636
00:48:43,802 --> 00:48:49,088
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am planning on going back to school and I'm finishing a degree this year and finishing one next year too.

637
00:48:56,911 --> 00:49:05,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a year away from an AA.

638
00:49:06,716 --> 00:49:11,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm another year away from another AA.

639
00:49:12,058 --> 00:49:12,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I can gloat.

640
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:19,042
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, for those that may not know, because we do have the podcast, but when she speaks to Pump Up the Volume, she's talking about one of her weeknight shows.

641
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:21,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was last night, and it didn't stop.

642
00:49:22,438 --> 00:49:25,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have a couple of weeknight shows, just a handful right now.

643
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:32,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got to be honest, if I didn't have a full-time job, just trying to manage all that stuff is difficult.

644
00:49:33,061 --> 00:49:34,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

645
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:45,924
[SPEAKER_03]: We may soon try to hire for the pay is great, nothing, but some type of director of weeknight programming that could get some of these great podcasts that deserve to be heard on the live stream.

646
00:49:46,324 --> 00:49:48,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to try to sort that all out.

647
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,365
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we have our website needs to get updated too much time.

648
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:50,725
[SPEAKER_03]: No time?

649
00:49:51,716 --> 00:49:52,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, good news.

650
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheeseburger is taking our advice.

651
00:49:54,818 --> 00:49:57,540
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

652
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, buying Super Mentor?

653
00:49:59,062 --> 00:49:59,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

654
00:49:59,882 --> 00:50:00,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Swell.

655
00:50:01,303 --> 00:50:02,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, one more email.

656
00:50:04,366 --> 00:50:05,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Last email.

657
00:50:05,286 --> 00:50:08,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Dun dun dun.

658
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:14,253
[SPEAKER_04]: This is worth it, because this is our buddy, Warrior Bob.

659
00:50:15,734 --> 00:50:16,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

660
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:19,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, emailer.

661
00:50:20,276 --> 00:50:23,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good to hear you mentioning the old Apogee and Epic software games last week.

662
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:27,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Brings back good memories from times when computer games looked like computer games.

663
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:31,199
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a topic that's been coming up recently in looks to my friends and me.

664
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:41,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when these games were the forefront of computer entertainment, back when Windows had version numbers, PR made adventure games and Duke Nukem games were named after the development time.

665
00:50:42,662 --> 00:50:45,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what you did there.

666
00:50:46,223 --> 00:50:48,364
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a certain look and feel to computer games.

667
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:57,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Visual animations and effects were the product of teams of technical artists so much as they were the result of clever programming tricks done by empty people.

668
00:50:57,758 --> 00:51:05,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like single pixel particle effects, characters made of multiple sprites, color cycling distortions, that sort of thing.

669
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:08,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel that it's kind of gone now and I realize I missed it.

670
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, I love the new ideas too.

671
00:51:12,283 --> 00:51:19,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to see games like Shadows of Clocks and Rock Band ever since I was a little kid with a bunch of game design scribbles in my notebook.

672
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:28,938
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, the only recent game I can think of that had the same computerized feel I grew up on was Cave Story, a freeware indie title.

673
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:34,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Entrenched as you all are in the video game scene, have you come across any games that still embody this aesthetic?

674
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:39,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I find I play games more for the experience than the challenge these days.

675
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:46,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'd love to find something like this and see what people with new ideas have done with old styles.

676
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, as always.

677
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the excellent show.

678
00:51:48,763 --> 00:51:49,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Warrior Bob.

679
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:49,904
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

680
00:51:49,924 --> 00:51:50,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Dan.

681
00:51:50,764 --> 00:51:51,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he meant that for my hoodie.

682
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:54,247
[SPEAKER_04]: He was supposed to be on the show this week, too.

683
00:51:54,968 --> 00:51:56,269
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I think he put that.

684
00:51:57,129 --> 00:52:00,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and the head didn't come, so whatever.

685
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:05,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my crazy thought, is that they don't make these games anymore because they just didn't sell?

686
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:15,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say this, is that, and for lack of a, you know, I'm not trying to be mean to anybody, but honestly, the market today is a lot more fickle.

687
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:18,756
[SPEAKER_04]: They want it to look pretty, you know.

688
00:52:19,877 --> 00:52:23,618
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care as much about the game, you know, the way the game plays.

689
00:52:23,738 --> 00:52:26,119
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care as much about the experience of the game.

690
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:30,000
[SPEAKER_04]: They want it to be pretty, and automatically, if it's not pretty, it's shit.

691
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,981
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's what's happened.

692
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,482
[SPEAKER_04]: They're playing to a superficial market.

693
00:52:36,335 --> 00:52:37,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're kind of right.

694
00:52:37,716 --> 00:52:38,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is kind of what it boils down to.

695
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:42,200
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when computer games kind of lost their distinctive look, so to speak.

696
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I look at a game like Sam & Max and to me that game is like a, it's almost a throwback in a way.

697
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:52,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of like those old LucasArts games, but in a newer cartoony, visual-ish style.

698
00:52:52,468 --> 00:52:57,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, they're out there, but yeah, it's not like it used to be then.

699
00:52:57,572 --> 00:53:05,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember walking into Egghead Software and you'd have like, you know, Legend of Kyrandia and King's Quest and all this stuff for sale and

700
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:09,068
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those were the days, but, you know, then again, a fake headstopper went out of business.

701
00:53:09,288 --> 00:53:16,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So that tells me that, or at least they're online now or whatever, so that tells me that, you know, they just must not have been selling as well as consoles really took off.

702
00:53:16,535 --> 00:53:17,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Kyra India.

703
00:53:17,796 --> 00:53:18,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too!

704
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:23,241
[SPEAKER_03]: My sister still plays, in fact, she is playing King's Quest 7 right now.

705
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:24,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what was funny.

706
00:53:25,103 --> 00:53:25,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

707
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:28,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Is, uh, I can't very close to downloading money.

708
00:53:34,389 --> 00:53:36,850
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people who still do them.

709
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:42,834
[SPEAKER_03]: There's BBSs set up so people can play Legend of the Red Dragon still online, which is like hard.

710
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:43,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And The Pit.

711
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:46,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we need an OLR BBS so we can play The Pit.

712
00:53:46,736 --> 00:53:50,378
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what my first, I would have to say, real MMO was?

713
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:51,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Gemstone 3.

714
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:52,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

715
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all text.

716
00:53:55,481 --> 00:53:57,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, how can we set up an OLR BBS?

717
00:53:57,362 --> 00:53:59,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's going to be possible if we tell them that or something.

718
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:01,204
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we make that happen?

719
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:03,177
[SPEAKER_01]: That shouldn't be.

720
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:04,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody email me if you know how to make that happen.

721
00:54:05,478 --> 00:54:07,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't think that would be too bad.

722
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's all on our BBS.

723
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,741
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play The Pit with our listeners.

724
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:14,363
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be bomb.

725
00:54:14,443 --> 00:54:17,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Warrior Bob is actually in chat right now and says, see, yeah, that's just it.

726
00:54:17,785 --> 00:54:19,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Famimax looks like a new 3D game.

727
00:54:19,886 --> 00:54:22,267
[SPEAKER_03]: No big pixels or clever animation anywhere.

728
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:27,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I think just the market big pixels didn't sell, I guess.

729
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:31,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, if you want

730
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:39,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing Ragnarok online, and honestly, I've read up on Ragnarok 2.

731
00:54:40,588 --> 00:54:46,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And while, yeah, it's cool facial animation, I like my cutesy sprites.

732
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:48,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's cool.

733
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:55,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that I can play it on a system that I'll have to have a whole bunch of crap for, because it still plays pretty damn fun.

734
00:54:56,712 --> 00:54:57,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like Lume.

735
00:54:59,252 --> 00:54:59,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Lume.

736
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:01,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Lume is such a good game.

737
00:55:01,193 --> 00:55:01,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Lume.

738
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:07,896
[SPEAKER_04]: And I miss my old, um, pixel-y, um, games like Doom and Hexen.

739
00:55:08,176 --> 00:55:08,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Hexen.

740
00:55:09,657 --> 00:55:10,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I've covered Hexen.

741
00:55:10,757 --> 00:55:11,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

742
00:55:11,678 --> 00:55:12,618
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's it for now.

743
00:55:13,198 --> 00:55:13,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

744
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:15,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a piece of the war.

745
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:17,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang it, there was a lot of mailbags this week.

746
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

747
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:22,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag to OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send your emails.

748
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:23,302
Get them!

749
00:55:23,963 --> 00:55:25,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

750
00:55:25,643 --> 00:55:26,904
[SPEAKER_03]: The segment's running low tonight.

751
00:55:26,964 --> 00:55:27,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

752
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:31,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that would be News Witness.

753
00:55:32,006 --> 00:55:32,166
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

754
00:55:39,595 --> 00:55:48,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So this whole Activision Blizzard merger thing happened a little bit ago, you know, when they merged with NVIDIA.

755
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of that, some investors think that they're getting the bum end of the deal.

756
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:58,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, actually, it's an Activision investor who sued over the entire merger.

757
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:08,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Their complaint was that NVIDIA actually comes out on top of the merger with a 50% majority ownership of Activision.

758
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:18,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of this, didn't think of the stockholders, or didn't think of the stockholders when they accepted the deal.

759
00:56:18,214 --> 00:56:22,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that is their complaint, and now they're pissed off about it.

760
00:56:23,676 --> 00:56:24,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I mean, shit.

761
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:30,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we must live in a sue happy world because that wasn't the only lawsuit that happened this week.

762
00:56:30,509 --> 00:56:33,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom officially got sued by the MKR Group.

763
00:56:46,232 --> 00:56:51,874
[SPEAKER_03]: over the game Dead Rising because the MKR group, they own the rights to the movie Dawn of the Dead by George Romero.

764
00:56:52,134 --> 00:56:59,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though Dead Rising has a big old thing on it that says not Dawn of the Dead, essentially, I can't come back to it.

765
00:56:59,436 --> 00:57:05,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting because I don't think they're going to win because of the fact that, I mean, can they really do 4 AM?

766
00:57:07,178 --> 00:57:10,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're zombies in a mall is a very narrow market.

767
00:57:10,478 --> 00:57:11,619
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just not room for both.

768
00:57:11,899 --> 00:57:12,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

769
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:22,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the lawsuit states, quote, in both, that the recreational activities of the zombies and absurdly grotesque kill scenes provide unexpected comedic relief.

770
00:57:25,534 --> 00:57:25,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

771
00:57:27,495 --> 00:57:34,079
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I kind of agree with what most of the people in chat are saying, is that they're zombies and they're in a mall.

772
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:34,920
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

773
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:40,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the characters aren't the same, the plot's not really the same, it's just zombies in a mall.

774
00:57:42,898 --> 00:57:52,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's my other thought, is that if Capcom hadn't put that thing on the box that says it has nothing to do with Dawn of the Dead, do you think they would have gotten sued in the first place?

775
00:57:55,207 --> 00:58:01,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my thing is that by putting that thing on there, it's almost like they admit, yeah, there's a similarity here, but we don't intend it.

776
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:05,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

777
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:06,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're, you know,

778
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:20,979
[SPEAKER_03]: because then they could claim that they were trying to trick the consumer into thinking it was a Dawn of the Dead type thing, but this is just them kind of trying to, they were trying to be preventative about it and cover their ass saying, no, this is not what it is.

779
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:24,581
[SPEAKER_04]: They think it's one more than Dawn of the Dead.

780
00:58:24,641 --> 00:58:30,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my other thing, is that, I mean, if somebody buys Dead Rising, are they not going to buy Dawn of the Dead?

781
00:58:31,907 --> 00:58:33,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is that, and because, you know, to sort of,

782
00:58:34,828 --> 00:58:38,369
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says, why can't they make something original like zombies eating someone's neighbors?

783
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:38,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait.

784
00:58:38,709 --> 00:58:41,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Well the next game supposedly wasn't going to be in a mall.

785
00:59:05,832 --> 00:59:09,476
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Zombies on a Plane, Zombies on a Train?

786
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:10,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombies on Moon.

787
00:59:11,438 --> 00:59:14,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly, Zombies on Moon.

788
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:20,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway, this whole Sue happy world we live in just makes me angsty, and people just need to get over themselves, so I think we need to

789
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:45,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big SU toward drama and death.

790
00:59:48,456 --> 00:59:49,056
[SPEAKER_04]: And tragedy.

791
00:59:51,558 --> 00:59:53,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends that are going through some crap.

792
00:59:53,899 --> 00:59:58,521
[SPEAKER_04]: So a big SU to the crap they're going through and the sources of said crap.

793
00:59:59,582 --> 01:00:01,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

794
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:01,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

795
01:00:01,683 --> 01:00:01,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

796
01:00:06,052 --> 01:00:09,296
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a pretty heavy FU though, so not that I'm wanting there to be more.

797
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki.

798
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:15,223
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to Microsoft, and you know, kind of a little bit of rant.

799
01:00:16,502 --> 01:00:29,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure everybody's heard about the digital rights management, how it's all fucked up, where you have a console that's basically free-ringed on you, and content you purchased on there, now you can no longer use on your new console unless you're logged in live.

800
01:00:30,052 --> 01:00:32,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really retarded that they do that in the first place.

801
01:00:32,934 --> 01:00:40,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had that problem because, of course, I have a new console, even though I fixed my old console, and it's funny, it still doesn't work on my old console now either.

802
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:41,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

803
01:00:45,598 --> 01:00:47,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Why hasn't there been a lawsuit over that?

804
01:00:47,681 --> 01:00:55,553
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't seem actually legitimate that they can have a lawsuit over it instead of complaining about live outages or the three rings of death or whatever.

805
01:00:55,813 --> 01:01:00,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they should sue them over this digital rights management stuff because if you've got content

806
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:08,414
[SPEAKER_03]: OnLive, and now you can't use it because your system broke because they're faulty, and Microsoft isn't doing anything about it.

807
01:01:09,034 --> 01:01:09,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely nothing.

808
01:01:09,835 --> 01:01:12,176
[SPEAKER_03]: There's countless stories on the internet about this stuff.

809
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:14,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So, why isn't anyone suing them over that?

810
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:15,418
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

811
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:21,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to give an FU to the antibiotic I'm on this week.

812
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:22,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the name of it.

813
01:01:22,932 --> 01:01:26,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Levvaquim or Leptixim or I don't know what it's called.

814
01:01:26,735 --> 01:01:29,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Some antibiotic the doctor gave me.

815
01:01:29,057 --> 01:01:33,121
[SPEAKER_03]: A, it's a brand name drug, so I have to pay more for it because they don't make a generic of it.

816
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:36,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And B, it's the slowest antibiotic I've ever had.

817
01:01:36,364 --> 01:01:42,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm allergic to penicillin, so also FU to the fact that I'm allergic to penicillin because then I can just take that and I'd be better in no time.

818
01:01:43,436 --> 01:01:51,283
[SPEAKER_03]: but the antibiotic I'm on now is the slowest one I've ever taken and it was more expensive than C-Pro or any of the other ones I've taken before that are just fine.

819
01:01:51,804 --> 01:02:00,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you're not supposed to take the same antibiotic as any buildup of an antibody, blah blah blah, but... No, we just now have a drug-resistant bacteria.

820
01:02:01,613 --> 01:02:02,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

821
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:03,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Lepoquine?

822
01:02:03,215 --> 01:02:03,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

823
01:02:03,615 --> 01:02:05,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell it's called, I can't remember.

824
01:02:06,538 --> 01:02:08,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So, F-U to my slow antibiotic, so...

825
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all my FUs of the week.

826
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:13,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can go, Jamie.

827
01:02:14,142 --> 01:02:14,663
Okay.

828
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:16,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I love Sega.

829
01:02:16,504 --> 01:02:20,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you don't love Sega, you probably have something wrong with your head.

830
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:27,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is good news for people, is that Sega Superstars Tennis will be a week early.

831
01:02:28,214 --> 01:02:33,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be on March 20th, and it's going to be out a week before that.

832
01:02:33,479 --> 01:02:37,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you have minigames, and basically it's Virtua Tennis.

833
01:02:39,162 --> 01:02:41,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It has achievements on Xbox 360.

834
01:02:41,164 --> 01:02:43,546
[SPEAKER_04]: They're named after older Sega games.

835
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:49,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can play as a bunch of the Sega geeks.

836
01:02:50,194 --> 01:02:51,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

837
01:02:54,418 --> 01:02:56,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

838
01:02:57,582 --> 01:03:00,064
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, it's kind of interesting.

839
01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:18,108
[SPEAKER_03]: No real clear answer on what exactly he's working on.

840
01:03:18,148 --> 01:03:31,715
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be competing, obviously, with World of Warcraft and it's unavoidable that the social and massively multiplayer games have become important.

841
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:37,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I don't know, very vague on what he's working on.

842
01:03:37,698 --> 01:03:40,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So, new multiplayer game, cool.

843
01:03:41,616 --> 01:03:42,757
[SPEAKER_03]: What it is, no idea.

844
01:03:42,797 --> 01:03:47,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't he like retire from the industry or something and he opened up his restaurant?

845
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:53,602
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he just went and bought a pizza time theater, which was Chuck E. Cheese and Showtime.

846
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:55,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

847
01:03:56,463 --> 01:03:58,864
[SPEAKER_04]: He had also a project anyway.

848
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:04,907
[SPEAKER_03]: They joke though in the article that it's massively multiplayer online pong.

849
01:04:05,587 --> 01:04:07,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would be pretty awesome.

850
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:09,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that would be possible.

851
01:04:11,616 --> 01:04:13,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So the drug is called Levaquin.

852
01:04:14,498 --> 01:04:15,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked it up.

853
01:04:15,379 --> 01:04:17,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just realized it's non-formulary.

854
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,080
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I paid so much.

855
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to get my doctor to try to prescribe me something that I wasn't paying too much money for.

856
01:04:22,103 --> 01:04:24,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just had to get that out there.

857
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:26,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares about Ponguy's MMO?

858
01:04:28,467 --> 01:04:30,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Although Chuck E. Cheese is kind of awesome.

859
01:04:30,268 --> 01:04:31,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you been to a Chuck E. Cheese lately?

860
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,411
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really horrible now.

861
01:04:42,014 --> 01:04:43,536
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a big theater room.

862
01:04:43,897 --> 01:04:47,702
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this room that looked like a foyer to the bathroom that had glowing walls and shit.

863
01:04:48,002 --> 01:04:51,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It had hands and feet on the walls that would clap, and it had a party room with hippopotamus chickens.

864
01:04:51,707 --> 01:04:56,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever been to Bullwinkle's in the Bay Area?

865
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:56,433
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

866
01:04:57,134 --> 01:04:59,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the old school Chuck E. Cheese's.

867
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:12,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how big goal ankles of a chain they are, but you know

868
01:05:35,652 --> 01:05:38,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Rocky and Rowling aren't that popular.

869
01:05:38,154 --> 01:05:41,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of want to go check it out now.

870
01:05:41,056 --> 01:05:44,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if they're still even open.

871
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:47,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, as always, John's Incredibly Shitty Dita.

872
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:48,832
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

873
01:05:49,132 --> 01:05:50,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I like some of their pizza.

874
01:05:50,273 --> 01:05:50,693
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.

875
01:05:50,754 --> 01:05:51,775
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a funny name.

876
01:05:52,095 --> 01:05:52,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a bad place.

877
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:53,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just funny.

878
01:05:53,656 --> 01:05:55,859
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really like having rides inside of the place.

879
01:05:55,879 --> 01:05:56,639
[SPEAKER_03]: That is pretty fun.

880
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:57,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow.

881
01:05:57,901 --> 01:06:00,103
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I like seeing inside a place is Street Fighter 4.

882
01:06:00,143 --> 01:06:01,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I haven't seen any yet.

883
01:06:01,684 --> 01:06:03,927
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you live in some places, they have been popping up.

884
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:06,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And over at Wired.com, they did a pretty lengthy...

885
01:06:07,486 --> 01:06:07,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not both?

886
01:06:36,212 --> 01:06:36,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not though?

887
01:06:37,213 --> 01:06:40,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do the old one on the Xbox, one on the Playstation 3.

888
01:06:40,155 --> 01:06:41,356
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always fun.

889
01:06:41,517 --> 01:06:44,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed the old Times Unlocked stuff.

890
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:44,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was cool.

891
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've told this story before.

892
01:06:48,302 --> 01:06:49,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to work for an Amco arcade.

893
01:06:50,404 --> 01:06:53,306
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we had Tekken 3, it would be like, who's next?

894
01:06:53,807 --> 01:06:54,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And have an outline of them.

895
01:06:55,048 --> 01:07:01,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I was keeping up with the overseas releases, I would come back and tell my boss who was next.

896
01:07:02,274 --> 01:07:03,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And I found that they switched the order for

897
01:07:09,062 --> 01:07:14,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that they're going to have release characters in this.

898
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:21,347
[SPEAKER_04]: They do something like that, so you sort of have to guess who it is or anticipate something that would add a little bit more excitement to it.

899
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:21,987
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

900
01:07:22,447 --> 01:07:29,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, some new characters are already being spotted in Street Fighter 4 arcade machines that are out there in the wild in the testing region.

901
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:34,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sagat and Balrog have now shown up in the game, but only as bosses, like old school Street Fighter 2.

902
01:07:35,212 --> 01:07:37,093
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot select them on the main select screen.

903
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:39,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So, kind of interesting.

904
01:07:40,152 --> 01:07:43,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And by Balrog, it's who we have in Vega over here.

905
01:07:43,636 --> 01:07:48,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, because I believe it is Boxer Balrog.

906
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:53,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Because one of these machines, I believe, is in North America, and that's where they gave this information from.

907
01:07:53,546 --> 01:07:56,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at the little video.

908
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:58,091
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're right, it's the US version.

909
01:07:58,312 --> 01:07:59,213
[SPEAKER_03]: So, unfortunately...

910
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:22,724
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some restaurants outside of California.

911
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:35,272
[SPEAKER_03]: One in Wilsonville, Oregon, Cary, North Carolina, Richmond, Virginia, Miamisburg, Ohio, and Irving, South Carolina.

912
01:08:35,472 --> 01:08:38,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a cool place.

913
01:08:39,035 --> 01:08:39,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty awesome.

914
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:40,256
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a

915
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:50,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, just wanted to say really quickly, all those screenshots you can see in Street Fighter 4, they all seem like they're in that upgraded version of the Chun-Li stage.

916
01:08:50,552 --> 01:08:52,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know, there are some other battle locations out there.

917
01:08:52,774 --> 01:08:53,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what's showing up.

918
01:08:53,594 --> 01:08:59,377
[SPEAKER_03]: A drive-in at night, a beautiful bay in South Asia, and an inland jungle in South America.

919
01:09:00,038 --> 01:09:01,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So some more battle regions are showing up.

920
01:09:02,822 --> 01:09:06,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at the movie that's up.

921
01:09:06,523 --> 01:09:10,605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Cybot vs. NGS and just watching how fluid it is.

922
01:09:11,285 --> 01:09:12,485
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cute.

923
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:16,767
[SPEAKER_04]: It really looks like it captured a lot of the old feel of the older games.

924
01:09:16,967 --> 01:09:17,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.

925
01:09:18,507 --> 01:09:20,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll definitely be checking this out when it comes out.

926
01:09:20,228 --> 01:09:21,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade and console.

927
01:09:21,428 --> 01:09:23,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'll tell you something that I'm not at all excited about.

928
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:24,910
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

929
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:26,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Road Rash.

930
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:28,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I hate Road Rash.

931
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:30,832
[SPEAKER_04]: But my husband loves Road Rash.

932
01:09:31,352 --> 01:09:31,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

933
01:09:32,972 --> 01:09:49,880
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been a little bit let out that the Electronic Arts CEO is talking about doing another Road Rash, which is basically a game where you're on motorcycles beating each other up.

934
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:55,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we had that scene in Final Fantasy 7, where you go and beat people up.

935
01:09:56,003 --> 01:09:57,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, get a Road Rash, I remember that.

936
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:09,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So, someone actually let a few things slip about it coming out, and that was actually Skid Row Sebastian Bach.

937
01:10:09,654 --> 01:10:25,760
[SPEAKER_04]: At a classic metal show, he said that one of his recent songs is going to be in, and to quote, actually said, it's a super heavy song, it just got picked up for some video game, Road Rage or Road Rash or something like that.

938
01:10:27,281 --> 01:10:27,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

939
01:10:29,178 --> 01:10:33,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, who would have thought that, like, a big scoop in gaming would have come from Sebastian Bach?

940
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:40,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, EA actually said, um, uh, that Road Rash is not currently in development.

941
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:44,911
[SPEAKER_03]: But Road Rage, that's a whole different story.

942
01:10:46,172 --> 01:10:49,035
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Sebastian Bach gets props for me because he was red.

943
01:10:51,937 --> 01:10:53,038
[SPEAKER_04]: He did do a good job.

944
01:10:53,218 --> 01:10:54,019
[SPEAKER_03]: By Nazis.

945
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:55,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um,

946
01:10:57,315 --> 01:11:08,425
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Store as well from Capcom and looks like it's going to be available for 800 Microsoft points or $10 or just $10 in real money on the PlayStation Network.

947
01:11:10,387 --> 01:11:11,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard too much about this game.

948
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:14,971
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look that great, but I don't know.

949
01:11:16,793 --> 01:11:17,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Tread them, I believe.

950
01:11:20,717 --> 01:11:21,057
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

951
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:29,829
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a special place in hell for them.

952
01:11:30,189 --> 01:11:31,649
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently, here's what's happened.

953
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:44,132
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this YouTube floating around, and there's this kid who got so excited because on Christmas Day, he opened up his presents under the tree, and he got an Xbox 360.

954
01:11:44,872 --> 01:11:47,033
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, here's what happened.

955
01:11:47,913 --> 01:11:51,334
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox 360 just was a box that was stuffed with clothes.

956
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:57,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So the kids got clothes in an Xbox 360 box.

957
01:11:57,391 --> 01:11:58,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there is video.

958
01:11:59,932 --> 01:12:00,593
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so cool.

959
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:03,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually haven't even watched it.

960
01:12:03,174 --> 01:12:05,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes you want to cry.

961
01:12:06,176 --> 01:12:06,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor kid.

962
01:12:06,476 --> 01:12:07,917
[SPEAKER_03]: He opens up the thing.

963
01:12:09,438 --> 01:12:10,578
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh my god.

964
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:13,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360.

965
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

966
01:12:15,761 --> 01:12:16,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a core system.

967
01:12:16,762 --> 01:12:17,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you anyways, though.

968
01:12:20,124 --> 01:12:21,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm going to open it up.

969
01:12:21,464 --> 01:12:22,325
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so excited.

970
01:12:23,686 --> 01:12:24,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you serious?

971
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:30,990
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so wrong.

972
01:12:37,815 --> 01:12:45,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Darketsuya in chat says, I forget which blog, but they suggested a pile of parenting books shaped like a car.

973
01:12:52,839 --> 01:12:56,481
[SPEAKER_03]: and we wonder why our kids end up so screwed up in school.

974
01:12:57,162 --> 01:12:58,482
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucked up.

975
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:07,448
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I don't know if you've heard about the news on this, Engadget, they've offered to find the kid and they're going to give him a real Xbox 360.

976
01:13:07,568 --> 01:13:08,748
[SPEAKER_03]: If he gets emancipated.

977
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:13,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I threw the last part in there.

978
01:13:13,411 --> 01:13:14,112
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucked up.

979
01:13:14,352 --> 01:13:21,516
[SPEAKER_03]: This kid's going to be in the news later on after playing the Xbox 360, later on he's going to kill his parents in the middle of the night because, you know,

980
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:23,258
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fucked up.

981
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:27,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, oh, I can't afford an Xbox 360.

982
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:33,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet you're an asshole enough to go out there and find an empty Xbox 360 box to fill clothes with.

983
01:13:34,082 --> 01:13:35,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And they put it on the internet.

984
01:13:35,842 --> 01:13:36,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And they put it on the internet.

985
01:13:36,723 --> 01:13:37,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's on the internet.

986
01:13:37,623 --> 01:13:38,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's just fucked up.

987
01:13:38,983 --> 01:13:41,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says, man, those parents are douches.

988
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says, look at me.

989
01:13:44,085 --> 01:13:44,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big man.

990
01:13:44,665 --> 01:13:45,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I can laugh at my own kid.

991
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:46,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

992
01:13:48,526 --> 01:13:49,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you're being awfully quiet.

993
01:13:49,627 --> 01:13:50,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've got a comment.

994
01:13:51,997 --> 01:13:52,537
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

995
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:55,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Disgusting.

996
01:13:55,818 --> 01:13:56,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

997
01:13:56,978 --> 01:13:59,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's anything at all funny about it.

998
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:03,440
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just really disgusting.

999
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,641
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we have kids that are just like, go to school and do dumb shit.

1000
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:10,121
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

1001
01:14:10,381 --> 01:14:12,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Because their parents teach it to them.

1002
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:14,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what's a kid gonna think?

1003
01:14:14,782 --> 01:14:15,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1004
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:16,623
[SPEAKER_03]: My parents are assholes.

1005
01:14:16,643 --> 01:14:18,003
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're gonna think.

1006
01:14:18,383 --> 01:14:21,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they just punked him with this and then like, you know...

1007
01:14:26,422 --> 01:14:33,204
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm wondering, is that maybe there's a second half where he actually got the Xbox later that none of us are seeing, but I don't know.

1008
01:14:33,884 --> 01:14:34,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt it.

1009
01:14:34,964 --> 01:14:35,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Still.

1010
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:36,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Still.

1011
01:14:37,925 --> 01:14:38,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1012
01:14:39,325 --> 01:14:40,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all I have to say on that story.

1013
01:14:44,967 --> 01:14:45,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's just

1014
01:14:46,571 --> 01:14:47,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Penny Arcade Expo 10

1015
01:15:03,822 --> 01:15:11,544
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to be August 29th through 31st, 2008 with the DigiPen Institute of Technology.

1016
01:15:11,624 --> 01:15:19,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're looking for 10 independent developers that want to do their games by attendees and media and publishers.

1017
01:15:20,946 --> 01:15:23,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's actually a panel of 50, I guess,

1018
01:15:27,776 --> 01:15:36,645
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry top people who will be selecting 10 submissions they consider are going to be the best based on gameplay and length factor.

1019
01:15:38,347 --> 01:15:43,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also going to be one that the audience gets to vote on, an audience choice award.

1020
01:15:45,373 --> 01:15:46,374
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a neat idea.

1021
01:15:46,595 --> 01:15:49,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the whole idea of bringing some independent stuff to the forefront.

1022
01:15:50,138 --> 01:15:50,759
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

1023
01:15:50,799 --> 01:15:51,460
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty nice.

1024
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:51,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1025
01:15:52,486 --> 01:15:55,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Props to these folks.

1026
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:57,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to go to Penny Arcade Expo someday.

1027
01:15:57,747 --> 01:15:58,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this will be my year.

1028
01:15:59,428 --> 01:15:59,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1029
01:16:00,908 --> 01:16:01,288
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1030
01:16:01,368 --> 01:16:01,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try.

1031
01:16:01,828 --> 01:16:05,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line very soon.

1032
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:09,170
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1033
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,770
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, one more story.

1034
01:16:13,871 --> 01:16:17,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this story is going to come as a shock to people.

1035
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this seriously breaking?

1036
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:31,378
[SPEAKER_03]: A study has been done that shows men like video games.

1037
01:16:33,539 --> 01:16:34,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Shocking!

1038
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:34,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1039
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,520
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't say.

1040
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely shocking.

1041
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:41,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this study, research that has been done by

1042
01:16:43,628 --> 01:16:54,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought men like fixed cars and went to baseball games and that's what men did.

1043
01:16:54,271 --> 01:16:57,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought video games were like a female thing.

1044
01:16:57,532 --> 01:17:00,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't Oprah bring video games on her show and stuff?

1045
01:17:02,094 --> 01:17:07,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but it says, you know, apparently...

1046
01:17:12,956 --> 01:17:20,783
[SPEAKER_03]: 34 Americans showed that among males, overall console gaming came in third behind using the internet and watching TV.

1047
01:17:21,363 --> 01:17:23,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I might add the internet and TV for both watching porn.

1048
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:32,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Among males 12 to 34, console gaming came in first and then dropped dramatically in older demographics.

1049
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:35,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be playing games until I die.

1050
01:17:38,174 --> 01:17:48,617
[SPEAKER_03]: The research shows women overall would rather talk on the phone, watch a DVD, listen to music, or read a book before playing console games.

1051
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:54,539
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an odd spike among 24-year-old females for console gaming.

1052
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:59,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Three web-based games did better with females, particularly among women of mature age.

1053
01:18:00,701 --> 01:18:02,522
[SPEAKER_03]: No real shocking revelations, of course.

1054
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:06,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft in chat says, LOL stereotypes.

1055
01:18:07,921 --> 01:18:13,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of Pat says, where was masturbation on the list?

1056
01:18:13,504 --> 01:18:14,725
[SPEAKER_03]: That must have been number four.

1057
01:18:16,946 --> 01:18:19,307
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that just isn't included with all the topics.

1058
01:18:19,387 --> 01:18:24,310
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to understand, I do everything alphabetically, so it's Matt and then masturbation.

1059
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Janai says, read a book, read a book.

1060
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:41,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking that, you know, there's probably a lot of women out there who like video games too, and I think there's also a lot of men who don't like video games.

1061
01:18:41,386 --> 01:18:43,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that might be a shock for some people.

1062
01:18:43,888 --> 01:18:51,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR using Skype or Zones Radio, but first, we have some voicemails to catch up on.

1063
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:57,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes when we're not live, some of the folks who like to listen to our podcast and so on, they like to leave us voicemails.

1064
01:18:57,762 --> 01:18:59,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to get some of those out of the way real quick.

1065
01:18:59,942 --> 01:19:01,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to start with this one.

1066
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:03,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, guys.

1067
01:19:04,643 --> 01:19:15,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a thing on your forums, but I'm known as Vaginator on the PlayStation Network, and I'm also known as Deere on Final Fantasy XI.

1068
01:19:16,405 --> 01:19:19,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say, yes, guys, that's a great show.

1069
01:19:19,346 --> 01:19:20,346
[SPEAKER_00]: I kiss it every week.

1070
01:19:21,218 --> 01:19:24,860
[SPEAKER_00]: and I did have a couple questions to you.

1071
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:38,746
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, if you've ever seen any kind of rumors as to a sequel to Final Fantasy XI and could you provide any details if you know any?

1072
01:19:39,867 --> 01:19:46,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, I heard that Survival was a really great game and what not.

1073
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:49,191
[SPEAKER_00]: We had something like 20 million players give or take.

1074
01:19:50,674 --> 01:19:54,356
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is though, I want to play it, but I don't have the PC.

1075
01:19:54,856 --> 01:20:02,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any chance in hell that you'll be coming to consoles anytime soon?

1076
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, PlayStation 3?

1077
01:20:06,423 --> 01:20:07,743
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, it'll be great.

1078
01:20:08,464 --> 01:20:12,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now my MMOs are really limited.

1079
01:20:13,447 --> 01:20:16,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice you guys have would be great.

1080
01:20:17,089 --> 01:20:17,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1081
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:19,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for the voicemail.

1082
01:20:20,978 --> 01:20:33,244
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm thinking that where you're getting the impression that developers are working on the sequel is because it has come out that the people behind Final Fantasy XI, that team, is working on another MMO, but it hasn't been said what it is they're working on.

1083
01:20:33,304 --> 01:20:43,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people are assuming it's Final Fantasy XI too, but I honestly think if they are going to make another MMO, it's not going to be Final Fantasy XIV or any of that.

1084
01:20:43,628 --> 01:20:45,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they may make

1085
01:20:46,256 --> 01:20:48,257
[SPEAKER_03]: A new MMO with some of the same concepts.

1086
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:48,797
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

1087
01:20:49,037 --> 01:20:51,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it sell as well without the Final Fantasy name?

1088
01:20:51,217 --> 01:20:51,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1089
01:20:51,817 --> 01:20:52,898
[SPEAKER_03]: A Kingdom Hearts MMO?

1090
01:20:52,938 --> 01:20:53,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1091
01:20:53,618 --> 01:20:54,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1092
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:57,299
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's nothing out there concrete at this time.

1093
01:20:57,539 --> 01:21:03,800
[SPEAKER_03]: You can probably betcha that they'll try to crank at least one more expansion out of Final Fantasy XI before it's done.

1094
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some people said this last one that came out, the...

1095
01:21:08,669 --> 01:21:12,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the time one, not Treasures of Otter again, but the one that just came out.

1096
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:14,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't I remember the name?

1097
01:21:14,774 --> 01:21:15,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Wings of the Goddess?

1098
01:21:15,714 --> 01:21:16,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1099
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:17,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Wings of the Goddess.

1100
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,897
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people said this is the last one.

1101
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:20,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1102
01:21:20,718 --> 01:21:25,041
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd think if they did like 12 expansions for EverQuest, they could get at least one more out of this, I think.

1103
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:29,204
[SPEAKER_03]: At least to hold the Final Fantasy XI fans over until the real sequel comes out.

1104
01:21:29,604 --> 01:21:30,085
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

1105
01:21:31,206 --> 01:21:36,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing concrete is that anything you hear out there is speculation alone.

1106
01:21:37,569 --> 01:21:39,250
[SPEAKER_03]: One more voice mail for you guys.

1107
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Missy.

1108
01:21:42,952 --> 01:21:47,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Wednesday, and I'm waiting for my mom at work, so I'm bored.

1109
01:21:47,034 --> 01:21:55,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I got the TFP script stuff for the holiday, so I thought I'd call, test it out, maybe be the first.

1110
01:21:58,019 --> 01:21:59,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I ordered a modem.

1111
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:04,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't shipped yet, but it's shipping from Memphis, so when it does, it should get to me quick.

1112
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:13,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss you guys, plus, oh, and guess what I did on Sunday since I couldn't listen?

1113
01:22:14,535 --> 01:22:29,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have any questions up at the clock, even though it was 8 my time, so I ran an episode in my playlist and listened to it like I was listening to it live.

1114
01:22:29,266 --> 01:22:31,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really recall the episode number of it,

1115
01:22:32,682 --> 01:22:34,824
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was fucking hilarious.

1116
01:22:35,244 --> 01:22:37,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he had the reverse cage match in it.

1117
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,151
[SPEAKER_03]: It should never happen.

1118
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure many of you know what it is.

1119
01:22:44,113 --> 01:22:50,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of paranoid that somebody's going to eject my computer while I'm not looking.

1120
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:55,703
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to go ahead and say bye, and with luck I should see y'all live Sunday.

1121
01:22:55,983 --> 01:22:56,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye!

1122
01:22:57,657 --> 01:22:58,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Couple comments from chat.

1123
01:22:58,537 --> 01:23:00,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says, sounds like she's walking and talking.

1124
01:23:00,578 --> 01:23:01,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of agree.

1125
01:23:01,619 --> 01:23:04,340
[SPEAKER_03]: SJ100 Matt says, is Misty the first PSP Sky caller?

1126
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe she is.

1127
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:10,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to be number one, but I had the wrong... You got beat!

1128
01:23:11,464 --> 01:23:15,506
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's definitely one reason I wanted to play that, is because that would be the first PSP call we've gotten.

1129
01:23:15,546 --> 01:23:16,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

1130
01:23:47,077 --> 01:23:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think that's really neat that she puts on the old episodes.

1131
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:51,821
[SPEAKER_03]: We do need to release more of the old episodes.

1132
01:23:52,621 --> 01:23:54,483
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those projects I'll never get to.

1133
01:23:56,224 --> 01:23:58,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's open up the skyline for all y'all.

1134
01:23:58,726 --> 01:24:00,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now wide open for everybody to call in.

1135
01:24:00,887 --> 01:24:03,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OL

1136
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:24,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ahead and take a call.

1137
01:24:24,676 --> 01:24:25,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everyone, Tom's Radio.

1138
01:24:25,596 --> 01:24:25,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1139
01:24:27,157 --> 01:24:27,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Legend of Zaku.

1140
01:24:28,177 --> 01:24:29,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1141
01:24:29,117 --> 01:24:29,737
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

1142
01:24:30,838 --> 01:24:35,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, just chilling right here recovering from the hickeys I got from clubbing last night.

1143
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:38,479
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's besides the point.

1144
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:50,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to, you know, probably point out, you know, the whole clusterfuck that's basic, you know, that Nintendo has created as a result of their attempts to create an online multiplayer game.

1145
01:24:54,378 --> 01:24:55,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got bad.

1146
01:24:55,559 --> 01:25:07,768
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's bad enough when people, like, they have to wait in front of, like, 10, 20, 30 guys outside of Nintendo World every morning just to get to school a week.

1147
01:25:08,308 --> 01:25:18,375
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you take it home, you realize that, you know, there's barely an online experience to begin with.

1148
01:25:19,136 --> 01:25:21,097
[SPEAKER_03]: But what about the children, Daku?

1149
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,178
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the children?

1150
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's playing to the Disney vote.

1151
01:25:25,084 --> 01:25:26,967
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Soccer Mom vote.

1152
01:25:27,468 --> 01:25:29,311
[SPEAKER_02]: But who's buying weed, Zach?

1153
01:25:29,351 --> 01:25:30,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's Soccer Mom?

1154
01:25:31,054 --> 01:25:31,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

1155
01:25:31,616 --> 01:25:32,898
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your demographic.

1156
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:51,124
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're playing the Disney card because, you know, think about what would happen if someone were to catch them off guard by trying to do something that allowed the other players to basically curse in a madness tangent like they did on Xbox Live.

1157
01:25:51,664 --> 01:25:52,664
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a shitstorm.

1158
01:25:52,704 --> 01:25:57,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox News for example would just spin the shit out of the Wii's image.

1159
01:26:01,969 --> 01:26:06,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Their eyes are being raped by the hideous voice chat inside Mario Kart Wii.

1160
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:09,150
[SPEAKER_03]: How do these rape your children tonight on Fox?

1161
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:20,513
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're basically playing Mario Kart or, you know, voice chat or anything like that, the only thing I worry about is ActHeft.

1162
01:26:21,313 --> 01:26:24,373
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, ActHeft just ruining the experience for everyone.

1163
01:26:25,273 --> 01:26:25,654
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1164
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:28,074
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you know, it's like, put me

1165
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:36,911
[SPEAKER_03]: with Nintendo saying, no communication between strangers, period.

1166
01:26:38,312 --> 01:26:47,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But with this whole friend code thing, you know, I would think that, you know, once you have a friend code thing, you should be able, if you want to say fucking shit, you should be able to do that.

1167
01:26:48,157 --> 01:26:56,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I mean, I don't know, I guess I kind of, you know, I kind of go, you know, kind of basically take the way, if not, you know, go

1168
01:26:59,179 --> 01:27:07,664
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, that might be one thing, but I don't know if it would be enough to fill the fears of the software market.

1169
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:10,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, quick question, Zach, a quick question, then we've got to wrap up.

1170
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:24,454
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, and he's quoting something you said earlier in chat, he says, you say that Xbox Live, they say, you know, N-I-G, blah, blah, blah, F-A, blah, blah, blah, and all that they say on Xbox Live, yet you bitch about Nintendo's online.

1171
01:27:28,646 --> 01:27:29,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Not enough, what's the answer?

1172
01:27:30,366 --> 01:27:31,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I mean, look, think about it.

1173
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:37,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can mute, in Xbox Live, I know you can mute people, right?

1174
01:27:37,848 --> 01:27:47,591
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though Nintendo is basically doing the mute for you, you don't even have that option to decide whether they're, like, rude, obnoxious players.

1175
01:28:03,851 --> 01:28:05,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my last question for you, Zaku.

1176
01:28:05,711 --> 01:28:13,835
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as you or I may hate to admit it, is this change, is this revelation about the online thing and Mario Kart Online, is it going to affect sales?

1177
01:28:14,645 --> 01:28:23,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt it, I mean, most people, you know, most people will even, I doubt that many people will even take advantage of all, you know, the online features anyway.

1178
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:33,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some will, but I think it's more important in that sense that some people will share amongst friends, you know, with, you know, with food and liquor and stuff like that.

1179
01:28:33,461 --> 01:28:38,706
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that the Wii is a social video game conference that's, you know, that's going to have that

1180
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:54,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you heard the bonus statement tonight, by the way.

1181
01:28:54,166 --> 01:28:57,127
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some very exciting news for you in there.

1182
01:28:57,147 --> 01:29:00,049
[SPEAKER_03]: 1877-GAME-OL, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1183
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:00,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

1184
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:01,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1185
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:02,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1186
01:29:02,111 --> 01:29:05,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Actdeft in chat.

1187
01:29:05,913 --> 01:29:07,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Actdeft in chat.

1188
01:29:07,054 --> 01:29:07,374
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

1189
01:29:07,394 --> 01:29:08,114
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1190
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:10,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fucking out.

1191
01:29:11,116 --> 01:29:12,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about...

1192
01:29:13,564 --> 01:29:13,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1193
01:29:13,924 --> 01:29:20,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk up in the bonus segment about the March Madness that DMN is organizing.

1194
01:29:20,387 --> 01:29:34,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and just so our podcast listeners know, because they don't always get to hear the bonus segment, because we do something bonus, DMN, one of our weeknight shows, I believe it is the shows on Wednesdays, the Insanest Hour, he is putting together the Top 64.

1195
01:29:34,773 --> 01:29:39,355
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing this March Madness thing with the 64 games going face-off against each other.

1196
01:29:39,395 --> 01:29:40,675
[SPEAKER_03]: All the listeners submitted in their list.

1197
01:29:40,956 --> 01:29:42,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And during the bonus segment tonight, the

1198
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:53,752
[SPEAKER_00]: You and Loki made a vote for one of the brackets.

1199
01:29:54,653 --> 01:29:59,295
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Ocarina of Time and Kirby Superstar.

1200
01:29:59,355 --> 01:29:59,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1201
01:30:00,616 --> 01:30:10,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that I'm with you, though not for the same reason, but just because I do think that Kirby Superstar is a better game than Ocarina of Time.

1202
01:30:10,871 --> 01:30:11,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, here's the thing.

1203
01:30:11,731 --> 01:30:14,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki and I made a controversial vote during the bonus segment of this whole thing.

1204
01:30:15,093 --> 01:30:18,115
[SPEAKER_03]: We voted for Kirby Superstar over Ocarina of Time.

1205
01:30:18,595 --> 01:30:26,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And both of us said it's because basically we both agree that Ocarina of Time is one of the most, by the gaming community in general, overrated games there is.

1206
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:30,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've tried playing it and I can't stand it.

1207
01:30:30,542 --> 01:30:33,603
[SPEAKER_03]: When Zelda went 3D for me, it just didn't work.

1208
01:30:33,643 --> 01:30:35,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Wind Waker, or not Wind Waker.

1209
01:30:35,264 --> 01:30:36,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Wind Waker is fine.

1210
01:30:36,145 --> 01:30:37,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Wind Waker and I like the

1211
01:30:43,124 --> 01:30:45,005
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like I think it's a bad game.

1212
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:50,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care for the more mature-looking length.

1213
01:30:50,508 --> 01:31:00,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the 3D ones that are on the Nintendo 64, and I didn't really get into... And I just love the Super Nintendo ones so, so much.

1214
01:31:00,153 --> 01:31:02,714
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my favorite games of all time, is Link to the Past.

1215
01:31:02,734 --> 01:31:03,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1216
01:31:03,474 --> 01:31:06,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe it's more solid talking about...

1217
01:31:07,246 --> 01:31:15,074
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, Charity Superstar is the better game there because Charity Superstar is like many games in one.

1218
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:18,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Many adventure games, also multiplayer games.

1219
01:31:19,638 --> 01:31:24,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, although the story in it, or the many stories in it,

1220
01:31:25,868 --> 01:31:39,479
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't as deep as Ocarina of Time, so you can have a better time playing it, and even replaying it, like Great Table Sense of Death is one of the games there.

1221
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:44,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically an adventure game that you gotta find treasures.

1222
01:31:45,683 --> 01:31:52,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's like 100 treasures you have to find, and it's very difficult to do it in one simple run.

1223
01:31:52,829 --> 01:31:55,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to replay it again and again to get

1224
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:00,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, but maybe you just want to admit that maybe a little bit you're just a Kirby fanboy.

1225
01:32:01,321 --> 01:32:01,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1226
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:05,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I do like Ocarina of Time.

1227
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:15,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's one of my favorite games of all time, but I just want to make that point that maybe Ocarina of Time is not that great of a game.

1228
01:32:15,248 --> 01:32:16,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all that in the bag of chips.

1229
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:19,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's...

1230
01:32:28,732 --> 01:32:35,255
[SPEAKER_03]: and we have ours and I'm sure many of you have been asked the emails we get this week about how we hate Ocarina of Time, which isn't true, we like it.

1231
01:32:35,295 --> 01:32:37,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, different show port, different port.

1232
01:32:37,295 --> 01:32:37,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1233
01:32:37,756 --> 01:32:39,456
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to put it that way, then fine.

1234
01:32:39,476 --> 01:32:42,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Actdeft, any other comments you have for our listeners tonight?

1235
01:32:44,278 --> 01:32:49,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, I want to say that I already got my ticket for Video Game Scribe, so in two weeks,

1236
01:32:54,587 --> 01:32:55,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

1237
01:32:55,368 --> 01:32:57,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care Actdeft, have fun at Video Games Live.

1238
01:32:57,089 --> 01:33:02,973
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call, 877-GAME-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1

1239
01:33:23,852 --> 01:33:27,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a couple of things about the whole Nintendo Online thing.

1240
01:33:27,954 --> 01:33:40,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't blame them for saying it like the preset text chat and all that, but when friends get together and play, it is the most rowdiness ever.

1241
01:33:41,139 --> 01:33:47,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, if I'm going to be playing Mario Kart Online with my friends, I don't want to curse like a sailor.

1242
01:33:47,962 --> 01:33:48,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say this.

1243
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:49,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that.

1244
01:33:50,443 --> 01:33:50,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

1245
01:33:50,863 --> 01:33:51,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it.

1246
01:33:53,021 --> 01:34:11,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too, and the weird thing is that thanks to technology, I'm still going to do that, whether it be this whole Ventrilo thing, or the, I love the idea of, I think it was even Loki or a chatter that said this, you sign on to the Xbox 360, and do your chat on the 360, and then play the Wii.

1247
01:34:12,032 --> 01:34:16,214
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I'll just bring my laptop next to the Wii, and I'll just put my headset on, and just like,

1248
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:35,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it depends on the fact that they're a quote-unquote family company, family gaming console and stuff like that, you know?

1249
01:34:36,226 --> 01:34:39,950
[SPEAKER_03]: They're scared shitless about online, is what it is.

1250
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:44,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Janai in chat says, but it's more fun when it's multiplayer offline.

1251
01:34:45,435 --> 01:34:50,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, I mean, honestly, when I get Mario Kart Wii, I'm going to be busy the whole time.

1252
01:34:51,114 --> 01:34:55,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say though, Jani, sometimes that's not an option though.

1253
01:34:55,919 --> 01:35:00,664
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of the beautiful things about the internet is that it brings people together.

1254
01:35:00,684 --> 01:35:03,246
[SPEAKER_03]: One reason I'm so obsessed with WoW to the point you guys make fun

1255
01:35:13,564 --> 01:35:16,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I get to play with some of my friends I don't see on a regular basis.

1256
01:35:16,265 --> 01:35:19,746
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, one of my closest friends lives in Kansas, so we play that way.

1257
01:35:19,826 --> 01:35:23,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we also have a guy in our guild who's from Idaho who's hilarious.

1258
01:35:23,327 --> 01:35:25,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, there's a bunch of local people on there, too.

1259
01:35:25,168 --> 01:35:28,649
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have a good time, you know, just laughing and playing the game and, you know, all that.

1260
01:35:28,669 --> 01:35:32,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's, you know, a lot of our listeners, you know, we get to play games on DS sometimes.

1261
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:34,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to play with people in New York City and all that stuff.

1262
01:35:34,871 --> 01:35:40,253
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, sometimes the Internet really helps fill in that void that we can't have people on the couch.

1263
01:35:41,013 --> 01:35:41,493
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true.

1264
01:35:42,853 --> 01:35:44,534
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, any other thoughts, Ranma, before we let you go?

1265
01:35:45,274 --> 01:35:45,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a couple things.

1266
01:35:46,035 --> 01:35:49,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, remember what you said earlier about a Hello Kitty PlayStation 3?

1267
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:50,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1268
01:35:51,458 --> 01:35:53,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you had a thing for Batch Maroon.

1269
01:35:54,292 --> 01:36:00,476
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the Batsamaru thing, not a Hello Kitty thing, but I've just accepted the fact that people are just going to loop it all on the same thing.

1270
01:36:00,516 --> 01:36:04,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say Batsamaru is Sanrio, they're going to just go, oh, you like Hello Kitty.

1271
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:07,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus there's the whole fact that I have the toaster and the coffee maker, which doesn't help.

1272
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:15,145
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't make, like, if they came out with a Batsamaru toaster, I would sell that thing to my Hello Kitty one at a garage sale so quick and replace it.

1273
01:36:15,165 --> 01:36:16,246
[SPEAKER_03]: But they just, they don't do it.

1274
01:36:16,306 --> 01:36:17,406
[SPEAKER_03]: No love for paint ones.

1275
01:36:17,526 --> 01:36:17,967
No love.

1276
01:36:18,007 --> 01:36:21,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my, so that's my, they have the Hello Kitty.

1277
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:28,109
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was surprised no one got me the waffle maker for Christmas.

1278
01:36:28,129 --> 01:36:30,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people said they were going to give me the waffle maker.

1279
01:36:30,211 --> 01:36:33,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was one of the things where I think no one wanted to buy it because they all thought everyone else was getting it.

1280
01:36:34,496 --> 01:36:37,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is funny.

1281
01:36:37,999 --> 01:36:42,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And before I go, when I went to Capcom a couple of weeks ago, a couple of interesting things.

1282
01:36:42,664 --> 01:36:44,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, the game room.

1283
01:36:44,667 --> 01:36:47,730
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a 32-inch HD TV set up.

1284
01:36:48,191 --> 01:36:51,032
[SPEAKER_03]: What's an Atari 7800 playing Mario Brothers?

1285
01:36:51,533 --> 01:36:52,953
[SPEAKER_03]: That is fucking hardcore.

1286
01:36:53,033 --> 01:37:11,962
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have to admit, I have to admit, when I was at the record store this weekend that also sells the old games, and I saw some of the games that they had on the 2600, like Combat and Warlords and all that stuff, I was like, man, how fun would it be just for one day to hook up the Atari 2600 games to the TV, the big HD TV, and just have a brawl?

1287
01:37:12,543 --> 01:37:14,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, come over.

1288
01:37:14,705 --> 01:37:16,427
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll hook up the 5200.

1289
01:37:16,527 --> 01:37:17,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Let Justin TV that shit.

1290
01:37:18,569 --> 01:37:26,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to actually have the 5200 hooked up, because even though the controllers broke really easily, I would totally love to get a Kix game going on.

1291
01:37:26,817 --> 01:37:29,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I want some epic kaboom.

1292
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some HD kaboom.

1293
01:37:32,122 --> 01:37:33,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Kangaroo.

1294
01:37:39,315 --> 01:37:41,677
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do that one weekend.

1295
01:37:41,857 --> 01:37:45,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one weekend we need to just marathon the shit out of old school Atari games.

1296
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:46,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we do this?

1297
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:47,821
[SPEAKER_04]: How about twice a month?

1298
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:49,883
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we can manage the time.

1299
01:37:49,923 --> 01:37:54,486
[SPEAKER_04]: We pick an old console, hook that shit up, and play it.

1300
01:37:54,506 --> 01:37:57,909
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about my, you know, vault in my house.

1301
01:37:57,949 --> 01:37:58,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

1302
01:37:58,629 --> 01:38:00,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if we can get the time, we can do it.

1303
01:38:00,851 --> 01:38:01,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

1304
01:38:01,451 --> 01:38:03,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have to bring over Clicovision and television?

1305
01:38:04,926 --> 01:38:05,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make it happen.

1306
01:38:05,806 --> 01:38:08,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not let this go the way the Super Mentor would think.

1307
01:38:08,188 --> 01:38:09,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We set a time, we set a date, and we do it.

1308
01:38:10,028 --> 01:38:12,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I bring over the Justin TV cam so the chatters can enjoy it too.

1309
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:15,571
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll point it at the TV and just go to town.

1310
01:38:15,851 --> 01:38:16,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.

1311
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:16,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.

1312
01:38:16,911 --> 01:38:17,172
[SPEAKER_02]: When?

1313
01:38:20,613 --> 01:38:28,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Okay, we can't set a time right now because we have to consult our calendars, but Ranma, you're in charge of bitching at us until it happens.

1314
01:38:29,357 --> 01:38:30,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it in early April.

1315
01:38:31,078 --> 01:38:31,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1316
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:33,239
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to wait that long?

1317
01:38:33,703 --> 01:38:34,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

1318
01:38:34,363 --> 01:38:37,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so Ranma, you stay on our asses until it happens, alright?

1319
01:38:37,885 --> 01:38:38,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1320
01:38:38,185 --> 01:38:39,565
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta let you go, Ranma.

1321
01:39:00,578 --> 01:39:05,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Relax, go to your room, change your underwear, and go back to play, okay?

1322
01:39:05,419 --> 01:39:06,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Relax.

1323
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:09,140
[SPEAKER_00]: The line was like going all over the place.

1324
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:13,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you had to go to rock and roll, but everybody was there to play Brawl.

1325
01:39:13,742 --> 01:39:15,102
[SPEAKER_03]: This is being clear.

1326
01:39:15,162 --> 01:39:17,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Each 500 copies per se.

1327
01:39:17,883 --> 01:39:19,463
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know what?

1328
01:39:19,523 --> 01:39:23,684
[SPEAKER_03]: You were looking at Brawl's target audience at that place.

1329
01:39:23,704 --> 01:39:24,264
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1330
01:39:25,825 --> 01:39:28,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, a lot of people that go to anime cons are excited about Brawl.

1331
01:39:28,506 --> 01:39:29,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are Nintendo fanboys.

1332
01:39:31,837 --> 01:39:35,260
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, I mean, you've got people my age going that's over four.

1333
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a huge dollar.

1334
01:39:37,582 --> 01:39:38,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not doubting you on that, Ranma.

1335
01:39:38,562 --> 01:39:39,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a huge dollar.

1336
01:39:39,503 --> 01:39:40,024
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to let you go.

1337
01:39:40,044 --> 01:39:41,445
[SPEAKER_03]: This call's going on for very, very long.

1338
01:39:41,465 --> 01:39:42,926
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you so much as always.

1339
01:39:43,226 --> 01:39:44,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, buddy.

1340
01:39:44,727 --> 01:39:46,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, this is getting to seven minutes.

1341
01:39:46,809 --> 01:39:48,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to keep them at four minutes now.

1342
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:50,592
[SPEAKER_03]: One more call, we're wrapping up.

1343
01:39:50,612 --> 01:39:51,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, how far are we in the show?

1344
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:52,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, almost two hours.

1345
01:39:52,834 --> 01:39:54,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've got to wrap up.

1346
01:39:54,215 --> 01:39:57,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just part B. Because the bonus, our bonus statement tonight was 15 minutes.

1347
01:39:57,918 --> 01:39:58,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 9.30 here.

1348
01:39:58,618 --> 01:40:00,480
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to end this shit.

1349
01:40:01,069 --> 01:40:04,174
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that being said, quickly, Loki, any last-minute stories?

1350
01:40:04,935 --> 01:40:07,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have last-minute stories for you.

1351
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:08,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1352
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, LEGO MMO, we know and love that they

1353
01:40:30,173 --> 01:40:33,175
[SPEAKER_03]: You Don't Know Jack has become part of Yahoo Games.

1354
01:40:33,655 --> 01:40:37,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil Zero is coming to the Wii in Japan to support the NQ thing.

1355
01:40:37,177 --> 01:40:38,317
[SPEAKER_03]: A Finnish company...

1356
01:40:57,861 --> 01:41:03,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Studio, has filed papers to trademark Pwnage.

1357
01:41:04,184 --> 01:41:06,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they're trying to trademark Pwnage.

1358
01:41:06,284 --> 01:41:07,885
[SPEAKER_03]: What, they can put it on shirts and stuff?

1359
01:41:08,245 --> 01:41:08,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

1360
01:41:09,246 --> 01:41:09,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1361
01:41:11,807 --> 01:41:12,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1362
01:41:12,887 --> 01:41:17,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, the PlayStation Store is apparently going to be overhauled in April.

1363
01:41:17,249 --> 01:41:25,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to look more like the Thing Store, which, you know, a little different, a little bit easier to navigate, so that's kind of cool.

1364
01:41:25,752 --> 01:41:27,153
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look for that in April there.

1365
01:41:28,284 --> 01:41:32,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Initial D Arcade Stage 4 is headed to PS3.

1366
01:41:32,227 --> 01:41:33,848
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1367
01:41:34,428 --> 01:41:34,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1368
01:41:34,929 --> 01:41:36,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a game I'm going to be importing, though.

1369
01:41:36,530 --> 01:41:37,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned my lesson the first time.

1370
01:41:37,671 --> 01:41:40,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Did the other Initial D games come out on consoles?

1371
01:41:40,272 --> 01:41:42,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they ever did.

1372
01:41:42,134 --> 01:41:43,094
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not here.

1373
01:41:43,274 --> 01:41:45,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had an Initial D on the PSP as well.

1374
01:41:45,316 --> 01:41:47,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a PSP one.

1375
01:41:48,118 --> 01:41:50,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, to piss off people even more,

1376
01:42:01,229 --> 01:42:05,090
[SPEAKER_03]: There's even a sketch of a Spartan done by the Rooster Teeth guys.

1377
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:11,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, his 360 died and has a free ring, so he sent it in to get fixed.

1378
01:42:11,572 --> 01:42:17,534
[SPEAKER_03]: He even, you know, took precautions of asking them, hey, you know, can you send this back to me in the same case?

1379
01:42:17,775 --> 01:42:20,756
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, you know, can you make sure you put the new case on the new system?

1380
01:42:21,176 --> 01:42:22,016
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of stuff.

1381
01:42:22,656 --> 01:42:23,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he gets it back.

1382
01:42:23,937 --> 01:42:25,077
[SPEAKER_03]: His serial number is mapped.

1383
01:42:40,664 --> 01:42:42,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they do that in the first place?

1384
01:42:42,706 --> 01:42:44,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you rub something off?

1385
01:42:45,147 --> 01:42:48,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just being a dick, is what that is.

1386
01:42:50,131 --> 01:42:52,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know one that also didn't make a cut.

1387
01:42:53,713 --> 01:43:01,039
[SPEAKER_03]: The singing store is also going to be getting 67 songs in the next update, which I believe is supposed to happen in April as well.

1388
01:43:02,099 --> 01:43:03,000
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem with those 67.

1389
01:43:10,146 --> 01:43:13,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1390
01:43:13,646 --> 01:43:14,947
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight.

1391
01:43:14,967 --> 01:43:15,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thoughts.

1392
01:43:15,807 --> 01:43:16,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Tired.

1393
01:43:17,347 --> 01:43:20,428
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is wine is good.

1394
01:43:20,448 --> 01:43:21,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Plum wine was good.

1395
01:43:21,829 --> 01:43:22,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

1396
01:43:22,889 --> 01:43:24,569
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I'm still working on that 360.

1397
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:27,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still being done.

1398
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:35,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, after our amazing February of fail, we hope March has been a good month to you guys so far.

1399
01:43:35,252 --> 01:43:36,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a good show tonight.

1400
01:43:36,593 --> 01:43:37,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think it was a good show tonight.

1401
01:43:38,186 --> 01:43:43,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you everybody for tuning in and supporting us and supporting independent radio and independent podcasting.

1402
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:44,451
