00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 2nd of 2008, where we're taping episode number 269 of Orange Lounge Radio live, as we do here every Sunday night, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In Part A, you missed a whole bunch of Sony news. We talked about Metal Gear Solid 4, some of the new bundles that are coming out, the departure of Phil Harrison, just a lot of that.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now we're going to get into some Nintendo news in this segment. Yes, Logan? Yes. Now, of course, like most things, Nintendo hasn't made an official announcement on the Mario Kart Wii Date, but that doesn't mean that retailers haven't figured out when it's coming out.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Including such wonderful websites as GameFly, GameStop, Circuit City, and I think a few others, have it listed as April 27th, that's two days before Grand Theft Auto 4, and that would also be a Sunday.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is this going to happen or not? Who knows? Do you think they're doing that to specifically get the jump on Grand Theft Auto 4, or is it kind of one of those, ah, I think they're going to be out of, you know, they need to press them, they need to have enough time to press those discs.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And also, the other thing that's really going to hamper that game is the production of those two fucking wheels. It's absolutely retarded, but if you were a betting man, 27 would be a very good bet.

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Very good odds on that bet, alright. You know, maybe one thing that the game has been, because it was originally supposed to come out late last year, right? Wasn't it originally a Christmas release that got pushed back a little bit? Something like that, our first quarter, I don't know.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, anyhow, perhaps one reason they pushed it back is because, guess what guys, Mario Kart Wii, it looks like Nintendo has finally caught on, Mario Kart Wii is going to have online chat in it.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's about time, I mean, Xbox has been doing this for years, right? Oh, I see. Mario Kart Wii will be supporting online text chat.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right, you'll be able to send text messages to your friends over Mario Kart Wii, provided that they are on your friends list, you have their friend codes and all that stuff, you will be able to text.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And you can do it before matches, it's assumed you can do it after matches. Not quite. Well, how does that work?

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You see, it's not like you would think at an IRC chat room or something like that. You can send them little pre-determined messages, like, I'm sad, or good game, and stuff like that.

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh my god, for real? For real.

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, it's not, like, as cool as you would think. Is there a way, I think, of trying to control the game right now?

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's like the Disney MMO, I'm sorry, the news must have changed slightly since the initial release that I jammed in or whatever, so okay, so now it's been, it's like the Disney MMOs.

16
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Like, if you've ever played, what is that, Toontown, I think it is? You only have a list of pre-selected phrases you can use.

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, that's the same shit. Yeah, you do not get to, um, actually chat in this, it's just little messages that you can send back and forth.

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yay, hooray, you know, even though there's, you know, because god forbid we should, you know, shield our children from all sorts of filth out there, you know, all those people.

19
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
People on your damn friends list playing Mario Kart, oh my god. Sad, sad, sad.

20
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
RossdielUT says, I'm sorry, that's, I'm sorry, it's RansdielUT, their names are very similar tonight, I think that's Rama, another name.

21
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Uh, RansdielUT says, text chat, better than hearing F, M, G, N, N, I, M, E, R, and all that stuff on Waffling, so.

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, you know, I think that, in one respect, I think it's a good idea, you know, because they are trying to make an effort to protect their intended group, I should say.

23
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You know, which was why, you know, probably just needed the same thing with theirs, they don't want their, something with their name on it, for lack of a better description, to buy the people playing it, you know. So, in that way, I think it was smart.

24
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's just playing a weight stamp today, that's all it is.

25
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, and RansdielUT continues in our chat room, chat.hollandjones.com, but if you're playing online with friends, you should be allowed to say whatever you want.

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know, I would like to see a mode where, you know, okay, yeah, maybe it's off by default, but maybe I can go in there and turn it on or something, where, you know, if I want to call my friends gay while I'm playing, I should have the right.

27
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Here's a thought, I don't know, maybe filter the obscenities. Oh my god, that's so hard.

28
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's like, it's stupid is what it is. It's absolutely stupid that you just jump through all these hoops to just frickin' play the game with your friends, and then after all that stuff, why even include text chat?

29
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know, basically, um.

30
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So they can put a big sticker on the box, support online chat.

31
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah, I can do the report on this, and basically, uh, you know, selected, limited, select those automated statements and responses while playing the game. Like, hello, I'm sad, I'd say welcome, you know.

32
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
RansdielUT asks, and yes, this time it is RansdielUT asks in chat room, why even make the stupid game online?

33
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, you know, for me, it's kind of like the DS game. I mean, how often do you go on a DS game and somebody is already there online waiting for you? That doesn't happen.

34
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You pre-arrange those matches over the internet on AIM, or you pre-arrange them over the telephone.

35
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So I'm thinking just fire up a Skype and voice chat.

36
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, here's another thought, and this is a kind of support Nintendo on this decision.

37
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You remember back to Final Fantasy XI, they had predetermined text things that you could type in there.

38
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Because this game is being released in alternate regions with a bunch of different languages, now there's no sort of language barrier between other people because, you know, it's in their native language no matter where you're sending this, uh, phrase to.

39
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Much like I think there's the same thing Fantasy Star Online.

40
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's Final Fantasy XI?

41
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, there's Final Fantasy XI, like I said.

42
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So that's what this is, you know, supporting that feature, because this may be also the chat with the other people, not necessarily your friends that you're playing with as well.

43
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I just wish they would also have normal chatting in there as well on top of this stuff, but whatever.

44
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm looking at the JustinTV chat for a minute, and usually I don't take a chance to read it, but our old buddy AkumaJP is in there and says, uh, type while driving. Better.

45
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
As if talking on your cell phone while driving wasn't bad enough, now you can type while driving.

46
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hey, well it's supposed to be remote, you know, you really only need one hand to kind of do that.

47
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Can I put on my makeup while I drive too?

48
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

49
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Alright.

50
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh my god, that'd be an awesome, like, Wii game or whatever you're driving, you have to use the Wii remote to put up makeup.

51
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Woman driver of the game.

52
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Our...

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, drag queen driver of that game.

54
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay, that's better.

55
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That has to be kind of hot.

56
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You gotta put on your makeup and your stilettos while you're trying to drive.

57
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Put on your furry costume on a Wii.

58
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And change the radio.

59
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hey, Mr. DJ, sorry to yell, can we move on please?

60
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Um, well, something that is actually fairly cool about Mario Kart Wii is that there is, um, an 8 finger bath mode.

61
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Which is pretty cool.

62
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So, um, it looks like you'll be able to, um, well, I think they're determining this more from a screenshot,

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:03,000
but it says that they have, uh, 8 people on, 8 icons, and, uh, lots of, uh, stuff on the path to throw at everybody else.

64
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Can't wait for Mario Kart. I'm more excited about this game than Brawl.

65
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why is that?

66
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Because I'm not really into the fighting games.

67
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mario Kart, I love Mario Kart. I bought every game system or every Nintendo system for Mario Kart.

68
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wait, even Double Dash?

69
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, I even bought Double Dash.

70
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But did you like Double Dash?

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It was okay.

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The battle mode in Double Dash really sucks balls, but, you know.

73
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, sorry, Jamie, but what do you think of, uh, ePlayer Battle Mode?

74
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I mean, is that a game selling thing for you, or?

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, I'll probably get into it anyway, but I think that that's fair and cool, especially since I know enough people who have a Wii to participate in that much play.

76
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I just wish it would, you know.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I was thinking what you could do is have a laptop in with, uh, Ventrilo.

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And maybe your snack coffee.

79
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's true. But, you know, I don't, like, for me, my computer is all the way out here in the dungeon, a.k.a. garage, a.k.a. O.L.R. Makeshift Studio.

80
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And then the Wii is all the way in there.

81
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So I can't really do that.

82
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm just here for myself. I got my laptop. You got your MacBook?

83
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Alright, I got this. This involves two different game systems over here.

84
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, what you can do is use your wireless communicator from your Xbox 360 and open a voice chat and that, and just not hook up the video to your TV and play the Wii online through your TV.

85
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So you've got voice chat and you're playing Mario Kart.

86
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Can you come over and hook that all up?

87
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's too many wires.

88
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Maybe I can get the best of my people to install it for me.

89
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If you don't want this to do, you're like, huh?

90
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Did we cover that story? I think it got cut from the show.

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
At Best Buy, there was a sticker on an Xbox 360 game that said, have Geek Squad install this game on your Xbox 360.

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I've seen that and I've made fun of it in the store. I'm like, seriously.

93
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I always chalked it up to somebody got sicker happy and put stickers on the wrong thing.

94
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's special.

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Eject, put the game in, drop it down, push the eject button again, game goes in.

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay, that'll be $50.

97
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Nice.

98
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Now, maybe the PlayStation 3 installation, that might be something that's going to take so long for some of those games.

99
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Alright, you know.

100
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, we'll be handling it now.

101
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What's my poll cry?

102
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There's a game that I played a while back and I think maybe during one of these shows back at our old apartment, Rob, but it's a game called Defend Your Castle.

103
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's a little flash game where you defend your castle against stick figures and get archers and all sorts of things to defend them.

104
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And also, basically what you do is you use your mouse to throw the stick figures away to keep away from your castle.

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, now this is going to be coming to the WiiWare service as well.

106
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's actually going to be completely from the ground up and it's only $5 or 500 Wii points, which is pretty awesome.

107
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And of course they built some new features into it as well.

108
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And apparently unlimited levels, the game will just keep getting harder until you can't play it anymore.

109
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So, that's pretty awesome.

110
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I love games like that.

111
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The old school Atari 2600 games, it never ended.

112
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Like Kaboom?

113
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What do you mean tell something with Kaboom?

114
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's going faster.

115
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's pretty awesome.

116
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Another game that they've already announced coming to the service a while back was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles My Life as a King.

117
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's actually going to be a WiiWare launch title.

118
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The price has been revealed to be $15 or 1500 Wii points.

119
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And we'll be joining some other games as well, including of course Defend Your Castle and...

120
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This one didn't make the list, but the major league eating the game, which looks like a piece of shit, and that will be...

121
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But that's not what you're eating.

122
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No, it's not a piece of shit that you're eating, but the game looks like... looks like pooey.

123
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Like stuff on your Wii.

124
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
A piece of pooey.

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No one likes stuff on their Wii.

126
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I've never heard of poo as an adjective, but there you go.

127
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And it's coming out May 12th in the US.

128
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Here's my question, is that the Final Fantasy game that was supposed to be the launch title?

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah, it's the Final Fantasy sort of SimCity mashup type thing.

130
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
RossDielYajinachat says FFPC will also use your entire Wii memory, is that true?

131
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That would kind of suck.

132
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't know about that, but they needed to figure out something with the whole Wii memory shit.

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Seriously?

134
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You know, if you can put these on a flashcard, maybe that's kind of cool, but from what I hear you can't, and that's kind of like...

135
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I would like to think that maybe they can do an upgrade right when the WiiWare comes out and then you can start using flashcards, but who knows?

136
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
One thing that Nintendo can get right though is the peripherals, I mean they will crank out those Wii wheels for Mario Kart.

137
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Here's the thing though that's kind of weird is that it will actually be sold separately other places.

138
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Fumitsu over in Japan has revealed that Nintendo is going to be selling the Wii wheels separately for about $11.

139
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No word yet if we're going to get that separately as well, but you know that if Nintendo doesn't officially put them out themselves, which they probably will,

140
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
you're going to have third-party developers of the wazoo doing this.

141
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because it does kind of make sense to have the separate Wii wheels because, you know, the same reason you have separate DDR pads.

142
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Sometimes you want to play two-player.

143
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
They will be coming out separately here at the same time as Mario Kart.

144
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh really?

145
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes.

146
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And you know this to be fact.

147
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I know, it's a good fact.

148
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well there you have it then.

149
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And it's the same reason why, because a little screaming Billy wants fucking, you know, his own wheels and then wants to share it with his sister or something like that and say it's about two fucking plastic wheels.

150
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
They're just plastic wheels, folks. And seriously, you can buy them now.

151
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I mean, just third-party things.

152
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And it's completely, absolutely useless.

153
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I mean, you don't need this thing to play the game.

154
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I love this. This is my favorite comment in the wild.

155
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Rob SteelheapT in chat says,

156
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Guys, say that the DDR pad has functionality and the Wii is a dumbass wheel.

157
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Touche.

158
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Touche.

159
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I just like the fact that this game controls with as many options as they have for Smash Brothers.

160
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Classic controller, GameCube, remote nunchuck, and then the thing sideways.

161
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No fucking way.

162
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
DarkHatsuyu says,

163
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I wish there was a wheel that let the Wiimote fit vertically so I could use it on me for speed carving.

164
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Well that's the thing too.

165
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's the thing that pisses me off about this game.

166
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If you've ever played one of these games that uses the wheels sideways like, you know, Mario Kart says,

167
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
or like, say, some of these other games that use the wheels, it's really horribly uncomfortable.

168
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You know, Excite Truck uses the wheel, or the remote, actually vertical so that the buttons are on top of the thing,

169
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and it's pretty comfortable doing it that way, but holding it sideways, you have to kind of contort your whole wrist,

170
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and it really hurts your hand playing it for a while.

171
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
In related news, I still kind of like Excite Truck.

172
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Excite Truck's fucking awesome, and they need to fucking make a new one!

173
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I've already finished the game, my wife has finished the game, if that's saying something.

174
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
For the love of God, give Loki's wife a game to get excited about.

175
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Make poor tracks if you don't want to make a new game.

176
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't care, I will buy them for whatever price you want to charge.

177
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I just need some more Excite Truck.

178
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't want to have to buy Motorstorm 2, one wasn't very impressive.

179
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That and custom soundtracks.

180
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I mean, Excite Truck was kind of neat.

181
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Okay, I can understand Excite Truck, that's fine, because that game really does need custom soundtracks.

182
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But like Endless Ocean? What the fuck?

183
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You don't need custom soundtracks in that game.

184
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You can't swim through the ocean and rob zombies, it's just not right.

185
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's too slow.

186
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Excite Truck's fucking awesome.

187
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You could play through Excite Truck's physical leaks, now that we know.

188
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I always play Excite Truck to everything, from Eurobeat stuff to...

189
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That makes sense.

190
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
My wife, she likes playing it to Justin Timberlake for some reason.

191
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I know it's funny, but you know what?

192
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Every time I hear a Justin Timberlake song now, I think of Excite Truck.

193
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I get to play it to like, really cool shit.

194
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Speaking of marketing tools, I did find something very disturbing that my husband showed me on YouTube.

195
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Using World of Warcraft to advertise Toyota trucks.

196
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh yeah, that thing is hilarious, that commercial.

197
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I finally saw it.

198
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh boy.

199
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I just, I don't know, Excite Truck, it wasn't that hard to make, and I just hope they have the option to download more tracks for many a game.

200
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What if they were to do like, a different type of vehicle for an Excite something game?

201
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
As long as it plays the same, I don't care.

202
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Excite Boat.

203
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Excite ATV, that would be one for a certain game.

204
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Excite, here you go, Excite ATV on the Moon.

205
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Whoa!

206
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Well they didn't have a space level, do you remember Nebula?

207
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Oh, that's true.

208
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's true.

209
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Alright, okay.

210
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Now we've turned in our most current news, talking about Mario Kart Wii into Excite Truck or other things somehow.

211
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So, sorry, the best briefing game on the Wii then.

212
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You know, Mario Kart really should move on.

213
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I have some Wii related stuff only, it's more current in a virtual console.

214
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And specifically for our friends in the UK.

215
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The games that are coming out this week from PAL region is Super Turrican, that was a Super Nintendo game.

216
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And Psychosis, that was on the TurboGrafx-16.

217
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Factor 5 named Super Turrican is 800 points.

218
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It uses the Classic and GameCube controller.

219
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Psychosis is 600 V-points, and it also uses the Classic and Cube pads, and also uses the V-mode.

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And for anyone who hasn't heard of Psychosis, because I know the TurboGrafx-16 could be on the obscure end, it's a side-scrolling shooter.

221
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You can also position satellites around your ship and still stuff it in.

222
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Killing with satellites is awesome.

223
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hooray, killing!

224
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I agree.

225
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So, if you don't want to mod your Wii, there are other options now for you to be able to play import games.

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Thanks to the freeloader.

227
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Of course, you may remember that from the GameCube, as being able to play wonderful import games.

228
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Gojoskis is now offering the freeloader for the Wii.

229
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's going to do a bunch of other things, though.

230
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's going to be for $19.99 in the US, UK for £9.99, I believe.

231
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And it's going to allow a couple of different things to happen.

232
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
One, it will stop any updates that are on the game disc, so you don't end up with duplicate channels and import stuff.

233
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's kind of what happens. Not a big deal, but annoying.

234
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And it will also be kind of invisible to your console, so that they hope that there will be no updates to destroy it, like they did with the GameCube one.

235
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It is available now, and hopefully will be broken soon.

236
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So, you know, we had a little bit of controversy last week, and I'm sure it's going to continue on into our Mailbag and Skype statements this week.

237
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Would you say there is a legitimate, non-shady purpose for this?

238
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, there's a lot of games that come out in Japan that we don't get here, or even in Europe that we don't get here.

239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And, you know, for those people that really want to legitimately import stuff, you know, this is great to do.

240
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's expensive, but, you know, it's great to import games.

241
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Or get stuff early.

242
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So, like on my GameCube, I had Silver Caliber 2, and I also had one of the Battletoad Fighters, you know, back and forth, all of them over here.

243
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You know, if this was more like, you know, the DS or something like that, where it was a region 3, I think you'd see a lot more people buying games from other regions, you know.

244
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Here's my crowd, or here's my question to the crowd about, you know, because we had kind of two different, very opposite sides, talking about whole modding and all that stuff last week.

245
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
My question is, to the people that are not, that do not support mod chips and piracy and all that stuff, is the freeloader ethical?

246
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's my question, I'm kind of curious.

247
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like, are you okay with the freeloader, seeing that there is a very legitimate purpose to it?

248
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I would think so, because you can't pirate games with it.

249
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Ah, okay.

250
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You know, as far as we're aware, I mean, you can't pirate games with it, but...

251
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Is it one of those it's just a matter of time things?

252
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Who knows, I mean, with the freeloader, I mean, I don't think, he can change the region on it, so, who knows?

253
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I mean, because it's obviously tricking the console into thinking something that, you know, is not really there.

254
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:58,000
My thing would be, like I said, you know, because now we're getting these staggered release dates, you know, like Mario Kart in the UK is coming out, you know, a couple weeks before, you know, the US release.

255
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I mean, if you really wanted to, you could actually get that name early in English and be able to play it.

256
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Comments from chat, rostielut says, well, if you can't pirate games, then by all means.

257
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Son of Dad says, yes, I just want to play the games.

258
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
DJ Jenai says, yes, I want to play all games no matter what.

259
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There's another thing, too, that actually was mentioned on the blurb on the freeloader sales area, was that for people who have non-region systems, that this is a way to play local games.

260
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Like, I, you know, I actually have a few friends who, you know, bought their Wii when they lived in Japan and moved back to the US and couldn't buy local games, had to import everything.

261
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And in case you're wondering, too, this will also allow you to play any region GameCube games as well.

262
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So if you had one of the GameCube freeloaders and stopped working on it because of the update, this will fix it.

263
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:03,000
All right. Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing some feedback from some of our listeners, because I know we have a lot of listeners that are into import gaming, because one of the fewer gaming podcasts actually cover kind of the import team outside of just America.

264
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So I'm kind of curious what one of our listeners, some of our listeners should use this.

265
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Are you getting one, Loki, or are you not bothering to get one?

266
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm not bothering, but I have a hardship.

267
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I have a hardship.

268
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So, you know.

269
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Director, you are going to be getting one, right?

270
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I am going to get one. I'm kidding.

271
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Let me know what you think.

272
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't have any import games to test it on except for my GameCube one.

273
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Thank you, Barbara.

274
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Look at me volunteering.

275
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Me, personally, I don't get to import games enough to get one.

276
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The only import game I've ever really gone crazy for was the media studio.

277
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I say I used to get crazy all the time on PS2, but, you know, even the little footage you did, you know I had to get Buzzfeed back in the day.

278
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, I actually have a Japanese PlayStation 2.

279
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I still do. I wonder if it works.

280
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I have a Japanese Dreamcast.

281
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
For some reason I decided that Wangian Midnight for the PS3, that was a mistake, and I can't import any more PS3 games.

282
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Was it not good?

283
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It was shit.

284
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Does it play?

285
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, it plays just fine. PlayStation 3s are region 3, so.

286
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Alright.

287
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Alright, anyhow.

288
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Let's move on, because speaking of the mailbag, I know we want to get there and it's coming right up, but real quick, I want to give you one more Wii story, and that's about Wii Fit.

289
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Wii Fit has been given a price in Europe.

290
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
If you're going to buy the game in the UK, it's going to be 69.99, but the rest of Europe will pay 89.99 in the, you know, Euros.

291
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's 69.99 pounds, 89.99 Euros.

292
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If you convert it to US dollars, that's about 130.

293
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's already been announced that in the US it will come out for under 100 dollars.

294
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm not sure if we know an exact price yet.

295
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Maybe if I think really hard, one will come to me.

296
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, hmm.

297
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What would be a good price for that?

298
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm thinking.

299
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Make it nice and simple.

300
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
99.99?

301
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
No, 99.99 would be too much I would think.

302
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Oh, well how about 89.99?

303
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's about right.

304
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That sounds like a good price for that.

305
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I think that's pretty fair.

306
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Alright, 89.99, you think that would be a good price?

307
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I think that's a good price for that, yeah.

308
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'd buy it for 89.99.

309
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'd buy that for 89.99.

310
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Alright, well anyhow, but you know, face it, in Europe, unfortunately, you are paying more for games usually.

311
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So while we might get it for 89.99, might get it for 89.99, we possibly will get it for 89.99.

312
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You guys will have to pay 89.99 Euros, which is considerably more.

313
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Sorry to break it to you.

314
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Alright, anyhow, let's open up the old mailbag.

315
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
We love to hear from our listeners and every week you guys email us at mailbag.org.com.

316
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
DarkStalker likes to dive into the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite emails.

317
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
She's going to read them right now.

318
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I have my snorkel ready.

319
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And your rubber gloves?

320
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

321
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Just in case of the Ambrac.

322
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Uhhh, can I draw?

323
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I think I have, well no, no, no, no, no, I have something far better.

324
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm talking about that 80s band, not the uh...

325
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I like Ambrac!

326
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Alright, sorry.

327
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Excuse me, Ambrac from Public Enemy is like the best combination ever.

328
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Hi!

329
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Speaking of great bands in the past, do you know what band really needs to...

330
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I've decided after all the commercials on TV, do you know what band really needs to come to Rock Band?

331
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What?

332
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Jefferson Airplane.

333
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, hell yeah!

334
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Alright, sorry, mailbag?

335
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't know.

336
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You don't need to get me started because I was exploring my favorite old band.

337
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But anyway.

338
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And it became Starship.

339
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yes, Jefferson Starship.

340
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Anyway, pardon me.

341
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You need to see the Lost Odyssey commercial with the white rabbit music.

342
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's pretty awesome.

343
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, you do too, thank you.

344
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Alright, please do.

345
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Okay, first email is from Cheezburger.

346
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Hi guys, I just got another viewpoint card and I already spent $40 on it.

347
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The games I have right now are Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario World, Donkey Kong, Paper Mario, and Star Fox.

348
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Star Fox.

349
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Boy, do you flip it there, Ms. Zarka?

350
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't know that.

351
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm going to throw that mic or something.

352
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
There's a little rock band in this room.

353
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
This is why we don't have text chat.

354
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
After the show, are you going to get a coffee at Star Fox?

355
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Sorry.

356
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That was just my broken finger, of course, extending on its own.

357
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I got to get a shot in my hand.

358
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Anyway, I was wondering what other good games are on there that I should get.

359
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Thanks guys, you get me through the week.

360
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Dude, you did not get Super Metroid.

361
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Get it.

362
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Oh, so you need more game recommendations.

363
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Super Metroid.

364
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah, definitely some Super Metroid.

365
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Devil's Crush.

366
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
No, it was Alien Crush.

367
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Guardian or Gunstar Heroes.

368
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Gunstar Heroes, Alien Crush.

369
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yeah, your list needs more Sega.

370
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I think that there was not enough Sega in the list.

371
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
This is only three hours.

372
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah, I think they all are.

373
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Mario Kart 64.

374
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Mario 64.

375
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Maybe Mario Kart, like, gathering those.

376
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Mario Kart.

377
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, I bet that's the Mario Kart you got here.

378
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I bet.

379
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You want Super Metroid now.

380
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Get Mario.

381
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And go get Super Metroid.

382
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Darkstalker, a chat room, wanted to see if you would get this reference.

383
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Okay.

384
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The baseline is the opening of the...

385
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm waiting for the chorus.

386
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh, it's going to cut off before the chorus.

387
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's Starfuckers by the name of it.

388
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
No, I don't...

389
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I know, because I don't really like that song.

390
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But it does have a sweet bass line.

391
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The bass line is what made me think of that song, actually.

392
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, okay.

393
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I did see this really awful band, and we went outside, and their bass line...

394
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It was a band called 8-Bit.

395
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
They weren't very good.

396
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So they were rapping and wearing half-nap suits.

397
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But we were coming back from drinking at the pyramid across the street.

398
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
This is at the Gilman in Berkeley.

399
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And we came back and stood outside, and their bass line was The Legend of Zelda theme.

400
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Their bass line was...

401
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

402
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
They were awful, though.

403
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I thought it was awful.

404
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But Babyland played that show, so Babyland reviewed the whole thing.

405
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
All right.

406
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Moving on, please.

407
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Okay, it seems like there's some head tracking popping up lately in console world.

408
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Everyone keeps looking at Sony One at GDC.

409
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm surprised nobody knows what the TrackIR is that's been going around for years.

410
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I have one, and it works great.

411
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It is only for the PC, though it has six degrees of movement.

412
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And you can use it as a mouse control so that you can use it with any game that doesn't have direct support for the TrackIR.

413
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's really huge for racing and flight games.

414
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
There is one FPS game that it does support.

415
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And that's from Pendragon.

416
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I guess this game should be used for Marble Madness.

417
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Heck yeah, that's a game we need a new version of.

418
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Or even better, to watch someone play, like, Golden Key.

419
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Nice.

420
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's a little competitive.

421
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You bring your head around.

422
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
All right.

423
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That's all we got.

424
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Next, even.

425
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Loki, Darth Vader, and Sky.

426
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
With regards to the call and last episode about system hacking,

427
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I have to comment, true, if there was some of the content that it hacked,

428
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
firmware allows you to play games without paying for them.

429
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And even though this can be seen as wrong,

430
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I think that it's kind of funny that they can do this in the first place.

431
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But some of the firmware is better than the proper firmware.

432
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
For example, a Skype program is only for thin PFCs.

433
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
If they can get it to work on thick PFCs, more power to them.

434
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
As it is more fierce, everything works on those systems.

435
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Also, if they can get three games that people make to work

436
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that as cool as home-made games are good.

437
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I also believe that if you do stop talking about hacks,

438
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
then you would mess up on a huge part of the gaming world.

439
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I'm just saying this only as a reply to the call.

440
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I know you won't.

441
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Secondly, you often talk about how the PlayStation 3 is a joint letdown,

442
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
but I have to say,

443
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
fair play that there are a lot more games than the Xbox 360,

444
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
but I am the only person I make up for friends to have a PS3,

445
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and I will think every single one of the other Xboxes

446
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
has three rings at one point or the other.

447
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Finally, keep up the good show and hope Skype feels better.

448
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Why not?

449
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Well, thank you. I am feeling better.

450
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And you do bring up an issue about...

451
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, I still sniffle a lot. My sciences are still kind of weird.

452
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Anyway, you do bring up a good issue about the whole...

453
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The firmwares definitely do serve a legitimate purpose,

454
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and I think that's how a lot of the people get away with this

455
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and get them to the radar,

456
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
because there is a legitimate purpose for a lot of this,

457
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
but I think it just becomes a moral issue about how you choose to use it.

458
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I mean, if you choose to use it to get Skype on your PSP,

459
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
which is free anyway, that whole thing,

460
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I don't think that's as big of a moral problem, so to speak,

461
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
as getting this on there so you can hack-store all the NES games from your past

462
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
or better yet, download all the PlayStation 1 games you always want to play

463
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and all that, or PSP games.

464
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You know, that's just a moral problem. I'm not saying one's right or wrong,

465
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
because there's a lot...

466
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You know, a lot of people steal music like there's no tomorrow.

467
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Well, there's a lot of legitimate things that they've started in homebrew

468
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
that I think Sonya saw, and they're like,

469
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
hey, let's throw that into an official release.

470
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Like, for example, internet streaming radio.

471
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That's been available on the homebrew scene for a long time now,

472
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and then they, what, locked up.

473
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They finally implemented some of that stuff.

474
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't know. There's a lot of stuff that comes out of there.

475
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
They have YouTube stuff that you can view now straight on your PSP.

476
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You know, they had stuff that hooked up to your GPS a while back,

477
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
even before they had the GPS for the PSP.

478
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
There's a lot of stuff, and now they're coming out with Hercorals.

479
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
They're like kill-centered stuff. It's Chrome group.

480
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Basically, you have the force. It's your choice if you wish to turn to the dark side.

481
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah. All right.

482
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Next e-mail?

483
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Sure.

484
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Hey, OLR crew. I was just e-mailing to give my side of the modding talk.

485
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I was apparently crucified simply for asking what the legitimate question by Rosso UT...

486
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Hold up. Is this the e-mail?

487
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
This is the one that Rosso UT had called in to respond to last week.

488
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Same person, I'm assuming?

489
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I think so, yeah.

490
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Just curious. Just want to get that out there.

491
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Because he doesn't agree with modding.

492
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Mod chips are part of gaming culture and community.

493
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Just because they can do bad doesn't mean people are doing bad things with them.

494
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I can include a whole bunch of negative comments towards Rob, Jamie, and Loki,

495
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
but I have this thing where I go and attack people I've never met or know nothing about.

496
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Rob doesn't want to attack us. We're super cool.

497
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Rob was the only one who even bothered to give me a fair chance.

498
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I gave him a fair chance.

499
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
What did I do? All right. Whatever.

500
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I think he must have typed this right as he was listening to the call.

501
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Give it a little slack.

502
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Not all of the people who do mod are people who sit behind our computers wearing a ski mask trying to steal games from the internet.

503
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
People back up their DVDs and music CDs, so I've seen their reviews of why it's such a gray area when it comes to games.

504
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Some people use mod chips to preserve their investments, others are interested in the technical aspects of it,

505
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and yet they are the group who simply wish to steal games.

506
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I like hearing Loki's talk about him trying to fix the 360 and all the modifications he does to it along with the Bmod.

507
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's just part of gaming culture and I'm glad LLR doesn't filter topics like this.

508
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I just wish that some listeners wouldn't jump down the road to people who are interested in modding.

509
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Next time my $50 game gets destroyed out of my hands, I'll send you anti-modders the bill.

510
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And Loki, you helped me a lot with your tips.

511
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I got my mod, I got my chips successfully installed so no more coasters for me.

512
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Epic Glyn. I hope you feel better than Sweet Rob's HP for friends.

513
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But this email is prompted by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending Dallas, Arizona.

514
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You need to have Olive Garden night pretty soon.

515
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Or surreal in how you have food for once.

516
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I don't know though.

517
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I can actually go to get food.

518
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I just ate there a couple days ago.

519
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm just saying that I can, I found things I can eat.

520
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah, they have all their altered puffs and stuff.

521
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Okay, here's the deal.

522
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I totally agree with what he's saying about that it is a part of gaming culture and that's what we're all about,

523
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
so that's why we need to cover it on the show.

524
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And I think he made some good points.

525
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I think the con made some good points.

526
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Here's something you've got to understand though, is that we have a lot of,

527
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I shouldn't say a lot, but we do have some developers, authors,

528
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
people that make games that actually listen to this program.

529
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And I'm sure it might ruffle their feathers a little bit to hear about this kind of talk that we're talking about these games.

530
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
We don't advocate that you should go and steal a bunch of games because you're taking money from these people.

531
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But that's why people get passionate about the issue because a lot of folks listen to the show,

532
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
they might work in games or make games and they hear about these things that allow people to steal their work

533
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and that's why there's layoffs at game companies and things go down and dah, dah, dah.

534
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So I don't know, but it's almost like, here, I don't know, kind of taking it a step further.

535
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
As long as this stuff continues, it's going to be interesting because I think the game industry has the potential to turn into

536
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
almost kind of what the music industry is doing where I think especially through things,

537
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
that's why I said last week, I think that XNA thing is such huge news

538
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
because I think in the future you're going to start seeing a lot more download your games

539
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and indie developers making things in-house that you download, just kind of like music is turning into

540
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
where more stuff is getting out there because of iTunes and stuff.

541
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But I think we're about five, maybe even ten years away from that, but anyhow.

542
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's my ramble.

543
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah, my little ramble.

544
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
There's no easy solution.

545
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
There's nothing any of us are going to say that's going to please both sides of it.

546
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I think, though, we're doing a disservice by ignoring it.

547
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Ignoring it's not going to make it go away.

548
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Personally, I have no problem with that, but someone wants to do.

549
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's not my place to tell anybody what they can or can't do.

550
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's just up to them if they want to deal with the consequences of being caught.

551
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Right, and here's one thing.

552
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Realize at any time one of these companies may come up with a magic patch

553
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that's going to nerf your Wii if you mod it, and there's going to be no choice.

554
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You're going to have to install the thing to play the latest game or something.

555
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's not just going to render the game an apple.

556
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's going to completely nerf your freaking Wii.

557
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You're bricking iPhones.

558
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Exactly, bricking iPhones and all that stuff, so that's the chance you take.

559
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Someday your thing's going to get bricked, and that's the chance you took.

560
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah.

561
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
There you have it.

562
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
That's it.

563
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
For me.

564
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Next email.

565
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Hi Sky, Lucy, and DarkSakura, I'm emailing you on behalf of the semi-obliterated PS2 sitting in a bag in my room.

566
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The other day I arrived at school suspecting it would be like any other day,

567
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
one of my friends informed me in his wisdom,

568
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
since PS2 stopped working the previous afternoon,

569
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and actually he took a hammer to the case and smashed it open.

570
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The irony here is that before the fan had only chipped a few teeth,

571
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and now the case is done for, the melting from the inside are bent,

572
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and the laser may be broken, but I'm not sure.

573
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
One of the ribbons has been damaged.

574
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I've taken the console from him,

575
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
and I was just wondering whether any of you know of a good site that I could get spare parts from,

576
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and particularly if lucky enough there were a way to test the laser,

577
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
with a lot of parts on the needle.

578
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I know you can order replacement parts from Sony,

579
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
but you could pretty much.

580
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I don't know if you can still order stuff from them,

581
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
but I was going to say,

582
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I don't know, the only way to test the laser, I would think,

583
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
is to put a game in it and actually test it.

584
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
For spare parts though, you might be able to check out llama.com.

585
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I've gotten some Xbox 360 mods set from there.

586
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I don't know if they carry PlayStation 2 stuff anymore, I think they do.

587
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Do they have like official, I'm sorry, Microsoft,

588
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
do they have like official Sony repair centers,

589
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
like they have for some other types of products?

590
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Like maybe there's a place you can take your PS2 and get just the laser thingy tweaked?

591
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Maybe.

592
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I don't know.

593
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm sorry, I might have missed it.

594
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
How old did you say the PlayStation 2 was?

595
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Did you say it was like an old school one?

596
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Um, it did not say.

597
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You know, if it's one of the old school, you know, huge, you know, PlayStation 2s,

598
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
the old model, it might just be time,

599
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
because obviously by the time you fix some of this stuff,

600
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
you're practically paying what you pay for a PS2 mini.

601
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
People put broken ones on these days, they're too lengthy.

602
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah.

603
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah, you can, I mean, they're kind of getting cheap now,

604
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
you can probably find a cheap PS2 for, you know, nothing.

605
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I mean, Rockdale UT in chat says,

606
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
if the system isn't too bashed up, you can get it fixed at www.oldschoolgamer.ca,

607
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but that indicates it's Canadian.

608
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I don't know if that would work.

609
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah, I mean, your cables and stuff, your ribbon cables,

610
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
they're about $10, and then the lens is about $40.

611
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So right there, it's $50, that's half the price of your PS2, mine is $99.

612
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Okay, I'm looking on the Gamestop website,

613
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and I don't know, we can go and buy some Gamestop,

614
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:19,000
but the old style PS2 refurb is $79.99, so the new style is $99.99.

615
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And if you find them at just the used ones, they'll be cheaper than that.

616
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And some of that is pointing out the Target was actually having a sale on PS2s last week for $99 new.

617
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So, there you go.

618
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah, there you have it.

619
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Keep an eye on those websites, you know,

620
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm sure that's not the answer you wanted to hear, that we're telling you,

621
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
basically go buy a new PS2.

622
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But keep an eye on those websites like CheapAssGamer

623
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and some of those other video game deals websites too,

624
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
once in a while something might pop up there, so, you know, always keep an eye on it.

625
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But if you do want to get your old system fixed,

626
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
there are ways that you might have to have a professional step in

627
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
or you're going to void your warranty.

628
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It just might as well, at this point, just to buy a new one.

629
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I mean, there's a point you got to say, well,

630
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
six months is a fix, it's just buy a new one.

631
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But RossCOUT and Chapman have a good point.

632
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Once he's a Final Fantasy XI player,

633
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
MIDI PS2 won't support the HDD.

634
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Then buy an older one.

635
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And quit Final Fantasy XI.

636
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm just kidding.

637
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm just kidding.

638
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Oh yeah, you got to go to PC first.

639
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
All right, anyhow, sorry. More email?

640
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Hey, I was a controller player on this machine.

641
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I don't know how you play that game on a controller.

642
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You've got me doing it.

643
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I know, I just, and it was designed for controllers, the hilarious thing,

644
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
but I cannot play that game on anything by keyboard.

645
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
The macros are so easy with triggers.

646
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They're really, really easy.

647
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But anyway.

648
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
All right, anyhow.

649
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Hey everyone, before I begin, there's a couple things I must say.

650
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
First of all, hail Jamie.

651
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Worship.

652
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yes.

653
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Who is this?

654
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh, okay.

655
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Ah, got me some new shoes.

656
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Anyway.

657
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Secondly, I want to say that I look forward to each episode Sunday night

658
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
and the podcasts that get me through my daily commute to and from work.

659
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Now that the formalities are out of the way, just let me say this.

660
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
As I listen to Rosalie T's thoughts on modding,

661
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I can tell that you Rob weren't too happy about that.

662
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I can tell in your voice that you weren't that happy about that.

663
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Let me just say that my PS2 has been modded for three plus years.

664
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
During that time, I have over $1,000 worth of bootleg games.

665
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Why?

666
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Simply because I do not have the money to shell out each week to buy new titles.

667
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But all is lost.

668
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
On the positive side, playing crappy games allowed me the chance to play

669
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and try out some of the games to see if I like it.

670
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Honestly, no one here wants to drop 40 bucks on a PS2 game

671
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
to find out later that the game sucks some of the waste.

672
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Having a modding console allows me to check out important games as well.

673
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
When I write this, I tend to think of myself as a hypocrite

674
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
because my real job consists of fixing computers with bootleg software.

675
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I tell the customers not to use bootleg enterprise corporate software

676
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
as well as software that belongs to a friend of theirs.

677
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But alas, some will not listen,

678
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
unlike also UTA does not take this to heart.

679
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Overall, I do not see a problem with modded consoles.

680
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Mods allow us to break things with consoles, not just copy slash burn games.

681
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Now, if I download a game that's really good, then I would go out and buy it.

682
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Case in point, Kingdom Hearts 2.

683
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
As a friend who is in the gaming industry

684
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
that gives me grief about copy games,

685
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I say to her, are you going to buy me this game?

686
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
No, you're not.

687
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Plus, I want to see if the game is actually worth buying.

688
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And if it is, I'll buy it.

689
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
In the meantime, leave me be.

690
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Overall, roughly, if you eat, shut up.

691
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It doesn't matter to us.

692
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
We are not damaging the gaming industry at all.

693
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,000
From my knowledge, there's no proof of that as either.

694
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
There's usually what it comes down to,

695
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and this is the same argument with MP3 downloading and stuff like that,

696
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
is everyone says that's a cycle thing.

697
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's just another cycle.

698
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It's just people, the industry doesn't actually lose money from these people

699
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
because these people are never going to buy the product in the first place.

700
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So you didn't miss out on a sale because they were never going to buy it.

701
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Same with people downloading import games or something like that.

702
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
They weren't going to buy it in the first place.

703
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The modern thinking is it's not going to hurt anybody.

704
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Obviously, still, they could import it and spend the money and do that kind of stuff.

705
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I don't know.

706
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's immoral, maybe, but is it really hurting the industry?

707
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Maybe.

708
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Not quite.

709
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I don't know.

710
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Say, for example, a lot of people are burning copies of Halo 3 or something like that.

711
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Yeah, that's going to hurt the sales of that game,

712
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
especially if they were intending on buying it in the first place.

713
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I don't know.

714
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
That's why a lot of companies now, though, and a lot of things that come out,

715
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:58,000
they spend the time on extra stuff like the packaging and the bonus stuff that comes with it

716
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
to entice people to actually buy their games instead of just letting it work.

717
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And here's another thing.

718
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Maybe people respect your games more.

719
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Stop putting out shovelware looking at you, Destiny.

720
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Just to address the part of the letter that talked about me getting kind of,

721
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I don't know what he said about the call, but I didn't see half of that.

722
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Here's the thing.

723
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Well, A, I was sick last week, so coming from Slack.

724
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So that kind of lends my sense of professionalism a little bit out the window,

725
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
especially because having a cam here doesn't help you.

726
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
If I make a motion or something, everybody sees it.

727
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
But also, it wasn't that I was unhappy about the statement

728
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
because I believe everybody has the right to their opinion

729
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
whether I personally agree with it or not.

730
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And it makes me sad to see listeners attacking each other and stuff,

731
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
you know, hug it out, agree to disagree.

732
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Here's the thing.

733
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I kind of knew.

734
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And that's interesting in a way.

735
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's part of the charm of the show.

736
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
We open up this guideline.

737
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Anybody can call about anything.

738
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You don't know what it's going to be.

739
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And we're going to deal with it and talk about it on air.

740
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It's kind of part of what makes this show unique.

741
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But when the call came in, I kind of knew that it was opening a can of worms,

742
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and that's why I wasn't happy.

743
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It's not that I wasn't happy with the opinion or whatever.

744
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I wasn't happy because I was just kind of like,

745
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
oh, boy, I know there's going to be e-mails on this next week

746
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and probably some more calls later on tonight.

747
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I was like, oh, I don't know if this was an epic battle I was awaiting.

748
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The rest of this e-mail.

749
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Thanks for reading my letter on air.

750
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And, Rob, I apologize for using your shared call on the OLR listener,

751
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
but I cannot read this.

752
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And allow traffic to be in the comments of Roswell, Utah, to go by unnoticed.

753
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Rock on and have a most triumphant week.

754
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
If Roswell, Utah, wants to comment back by all means,

755
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
my e-mail, Addie, is listed, and I guess you can p.m.

756
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah, they're both in chat right now.

757
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Hug it out, boys.

758
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Hug it out.

759
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And he wants me to plug his podcast, so I am.

760
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Okay, fair enough.

761
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Anime Jam Session at djromnet.net slash Anime Jam.

762
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So listen to it.

763
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But not right now, because we're live.

764
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
All right.

765
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Any other e-mails, or is that it?

766
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
This one.

767
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Dang, we have talent e-mails tonight.

768
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I know.

769
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
All right, let's get through them.

770
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Hey, OLR crew, I have a question for Dark Sakura.

771
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Hey, cool.

772
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You said months ago that you could pump up the volume on hold after your laptop got fried.

773
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You know, that's how my PC got fried.

774
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
How is that coming along?

775
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It would be great to listen to pump up the volume again someday.

776
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
It's a nice break from what the 24-7 stream provides on GS68.

777
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Actually, there's progress in this today.

778
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I've had a computer that I could use, but the problem is that I want something with

779
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
a bit more on the graphics capability side, just for the sake of all the other projects

780
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I do.

781
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And I have been using my laptop, but my laptop likes to run really freaking slow.

782
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I think I'm actually going to replace all the memory in it.

783
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But we have gutted out one of the Vio's sitting in our garage.

784
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And although one of them is promised, that sort of leaves the other one up in the air

785
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
because it might be promised as well.

786
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
We are looking into putting a graphics card in it.

787
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
My old hard drive, basically building a new Frank computer for me.

788
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
That was what my old computer was, sort of the Frankenstein part.

789
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Pump up the volume, it's all just a plan.

790
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm looking for a return of pump up the volume soon.

791
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,000
However, I'm also going back to college, which I don't know if I've mentioned to my co-host

792
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
here.

793
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But I am planning on going back to school and I'm finishing a degree this year and finishing

794
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
one next year too.

795
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I forbid you learning more.

796
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
What is this education you speak of?

797
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You don't mean that.

798
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I am a year away.

799
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
You am educated enough.

800
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm a year away from an AA.

801
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm another year away from another AA.

802
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And then I can go.

803
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
By the way, for those that may not know, because we do have the podcast, when she speaks of

804
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
pump up the volume, she's talking about one of her weeknight shows.

805
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, it was when I said it didn't suck.

806
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And we do have a couple of weeknight shows, just a handful right now.

807
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I've got to be honest, if I didn't have a full-time job, trying to manage all that stuff

808
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
is difficult.

809
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So I don't know, we may soon try to hire, for the pay is great, nothing, but some type

810
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
of director of weeknight programming that can get some of these great podcasts that

811
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
deserve to be heard on the live stream.

812
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Just to try to sort that all out.

813
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But then we have our website.

814
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
You can get updated too much.

815
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
No time?

816
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Hey, good news.

817
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Cheeseburgers taking RFI.

818
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
What's that?

819
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh, buying Super Mentor.

820
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yep.

821
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Swell.

822
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Alright, one more email.

823
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Last email.

824
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Dun dun dun.

825
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So this is worth it, because this is our buddy, Warrior Bob.

826
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Yay.

827
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Hi, host.

828
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Hi, emailer.

829
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's so good to hear you mentioning the old Apogee and Epic software games last week.

830
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Respected memories from times when computer games looked like computer games.

831
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
This is a topic that's been coming up recently in the looks of my friends and me.

832
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Back when these games were the forefront of computer entertainment, back when Windows

833
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
had version numbers, PR made adventure games, and Duke Nukem games weren't named after

834
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
the development time.

835
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I see what you did there.

836
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
There was a certain look and feel to computer games.

837
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
The visual animations and effects were the product of teams of technical artists, so

838
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
much as they were the result of clever programming tricks done by empty people.

839
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Things like single pixel particle effects, characters made of multiple sprites, color

840
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
cycling distortions, that sort of thing.

841
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I feel that it's kind of gone now, and I realize I missed it.

842
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Don't get me wrong, I love the new ideas, too.

843
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I wanted to see games like Shadows of Colossus and Rock Band ever since I was a little kid

844
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
with a bunch of game design scribbles in my notebook.

845
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But at the same time, the only recent game I can think of that had the same computerized

846
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
feel I grew up on was Cave Story, a freeware indie title.

847
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Entrenched as you all are in the video game scene, had you come across any games that

848
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
still embody this aesthetic?

849
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I find I play games more for the experience than the challenge these days, and so I'd

850
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
love to find something like this and see what people with new ideas have done with old styles.

851
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Thanks again, as always.

852
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Keep up the excellent show, Warrior Bob.

853
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
P.S.

854
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Hi, Dan.

855
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I guess he was at first.

856
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
He was supposed to be on the show this week, too.

857
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That's why I couldn't even put that.

858
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That makes sense.

859
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I know, and butthead didn't come, so whatever.

860
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Here's my crazy thought, is that they don't make these games anymore because they just

861
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
didn't sell?

862
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I have to say this, is that, and for lack of a, you know, I'm not trying to be mean

863
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
to anybody, but honestly, the market today is a lot more fickle.

864
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
They want it to look pretty, you know.

865
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
They don't care as much about the game, you know, the way the game plays.

866
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
They don't care as much about the experience of the game.

867
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
They want it to be pretty, and automatically it's not pretty as shit.

868
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So that's what's happened.

869
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
They're playing towards a superficial market.

870
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I think you're kind of right.

871
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I think that is kind of what it boils down to.

872
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Absolutely, computer games kind of lost their distinctive look, so to speak.

873
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
But then I look at a game like Sam & Max, and to me, that game is like a, it's almost

874
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
a throwback in a way.

875
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It is kind of like those old LucasArts games, but in a newer, cartoony, visual-ish style.

876
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So, I mean, they're out there, but yeah, it's not like it used to be then.

877
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I remember walking into A-Head Software, and you'd have like, you know, Legend of Kyrandia

878
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
and King's Quest and all this stuff for sale, and you know, those were the days, but you

879
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
know, then again, A-Head Software went out of business.

880
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So that tells me that, or at least they're online now or whatever, so that tells me that

881
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
you know, they just must not have been selling as well, as consoles really took off.

882
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I love Kyrandia.

883
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Me too!

884
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
My sister still plays, in fact, she is playing King's Quest VII right now.

885
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I'll tell you what was funny, is I came very close to downloading a mug.

886
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Those still running.

887
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
That's awesome.

888
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
There's a mug still running.

889
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'll have to find the link for you, but there's people who still do them.

890
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
There's BBS's set up so people can play Legend of the Red Dragon still online, which is like

891
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
hard, and The Pit.

892
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Dude, we need an OLR BBS so we can play The Pit.

893
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You know what my first, I would have to say real MMO was?

894
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Gemstone 3.

895
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Awesome.

896
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It was all text.

897
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Dude, how can we set up an OLR BBS?

898
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I know it's going to be possible to be like Telnet or something.

899
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
How can we make that happen?

900
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
That shouldn't be possible.

901
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Somebody email me if you know how to make that happen.

902
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I wouldn't think that would be a good idea.

903
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I know.

904
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
The OLR BBS, we're going to play The Pit with our wizards.

905
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
That'd be Red Train Wars.

906
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
That'd be bomb.

907
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
That would be, that would be fun.

908
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Warrior Bob is actually in chat right now and says, see, yeah, that's just it.

909
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
FemiMax looks like a new 3D game.

910
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
No big pixels or clever animation anywhere.

911
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Oh yeah, I think just the market, big pixels didn't sell, I guess.

912
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Well, I mean, if you, if you want sprite-based stuff, I mean,

913
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
you still got, you know, like I'm playing Ragnarok online and honestly,

914
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I've read up on Ragnarok too.

915
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And while, yeah, it's cool, facial animation, ooh, you know, I,

916
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I like my cute few sprites.

917
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You know, I think it's cool.

918
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I like that I can play it on a system that I don't have to have a whole

919
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
bunch of crap for because it still plays pretty damn fun.

920
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
You know, I, and I like Lulu.

921
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I love Lulu.

922
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Lulu is such a good game.

923
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And I miss my old pixely games like Doom and Hexen.

924
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I love Hexen.

925
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I've covered Hexen.

926
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Good times.

927
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
That's it for tonight.

928
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Alrighty.

929
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Get a piece of the war.

930
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Dang, there was a lot of mailbags this week.

931
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I know.

932
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Mailbag to OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send your emails.

933
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Hexen!

934
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Alright, let's get back to some gaming news.

935
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The segments weren't involved tonight.

936
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I know.

937
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Oh yeah, that would be neat, wouldn't it?

938
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
No.

939
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Nope.

940
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
No, it's fine.

941
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It's up.

942
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Yeah.

943
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I'm looking at one.

944
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So, um, this whole Activision Blizzard merger thing, uh, happened a little bit ago, you

945
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
know, when they merged with Nvidia.

946
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And, uh, because of that, some investors think that they're getting the bum end of the deal.

947
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And in fact, actually, it's an Activision investor who sued over the entire merger.

948
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Um, their complaint was that Nvidia actually comes out on top of the merger with 50% majority

949
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
ownership of Activision.

950
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Um, and because of this, uh, didn't think that the stockholders, uh, or didn't think

951
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
of the stockholders when they accepted the deal.

952
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
So, that is their complaint and now they're, you know, pissed off about it.

953
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I don't know.

954
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I mean, shit.

955
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Nvidia has some pretty good properties.

956
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I don't think it's totally bad that they merged together, but I don't know.

957
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
You're a stockholder.

958
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I guess you're getting jipped out of a few bucks.

959
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Well, we must live in a sue-happy world because that wasn't the only lawsuit that happened

960
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
this week.

961
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Capcom officially got sued by the MKR Group over the game Dead Rising because the MKR

962
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Group, they own the rights to the movie Dawn of the Dead by George Romero.

963
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And even though Dead Rising has a big old thing on it that says not Dawn of the Dead,

964
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
essentially, uh, Capcom got sued.

965
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And as interesting as, I don't think they're going to win because the fact that, I mean,

966
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
can they really sue for, you know.

967
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
But they're zombies in a mall is a, is a very narrow market.

968
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
There's just not room for both.

969
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

970
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Well, the lawsuit states, quote, in both that the recreational activities of the zombies

971
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and absurdly grotesque kill scenes provide unexpected comedy, comedic relief.

972
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Nice.

973
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Um, but yeah, I know I kind of agree.

974
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I kind of agree with what most of the people in chat are saying is that they're zombies

975
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
and they're in a mall.

976
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
That's it.

977
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I mean, the characters aren't the same.

978
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
The plot's not really the same.

979
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It's just zombies in a mall.

980
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And how they become zombies aren't even the same.

981
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Okay.

982
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Here's my other thought is that, um, if Capcom hadn't put that thing on the box that says

983
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
it had nothing to do with Dawn of the Dead, do you think they would have gotten sued in

984
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
the first place?

985
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Yeah.

986
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Because my thing is that by putting that thing on there, it's almost like they admit, yeah,

987
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
there's a similarity here.

988
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
No.

989
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
But we, we don't intend it.

990
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I don't know.

991
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I think there was, you know, because then they could claim that, you know, they were

992
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
trying to trick the consumer into thinking it was a Dawn of the Dead type thing.

993
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
But this is just them kind of trying to, they were trying to be preventative about it and

994
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
cover their ass saying, no, this is not what it is.

995
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Do they use lawn mowers in Dawn of the Dead?

996
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Here, here's my other thing is that, I mean, if somebody buys Dead Rising, are they not

997
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
going to buy Dawn of the Dead?

998
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You know, is that because, you know, to sort of claim that there's some type of like, you

999
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
know, oh, my rights have been abated and all this, you have to kind of claim that there's

1000
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
financial losses going on.

1001
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And my kind of whole thing is that the type of people who play Dead Rising exactly would

1002
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
go out and buy Dawn of the Dead.

1003
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So it's not like one's hurting the other.

1004
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You know what I mean?

1005
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,000
SSJ 100 Matt says, why can't they make something original like zombies eating someone's neighbors?

1006
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Oh, wait.

1007
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Well, the next game supposedly wasn't going to be like, you know, in a mall and stuff.

1008
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
It was just going to be some other zombies on a plane.

1009
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
No, not zombies on a plane.

1010
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Zombies on the train.

1011
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Zombies on the moon.

1012
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Yes, exactly.

1013
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Zombies on the moon.

1014
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah.

1015
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
All right.

1016
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Well, anyway, this whole Sue happy world we live in just makes me angsty and people just

1017
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
need to get over themselves.

1018
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So I think we need to do the F.U. of the week.

1019
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
My F.U. of the week.

1020
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It's a big F.U. towards drama and death.

1021
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah.

1022
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And tragedy.

1023
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I think F.U. to the crap they're going to do and the sources of said crap.

1024
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Unfortunately.

1025
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Is that it?

1026
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah.

1027
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Okay.

1028
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That was a pretty heavy F.U. though, so not that I'm wanting there to be more, but.

1029
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
All right.

1030
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Logie.

1031
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
F.U. to Microsoft and, you know, kind of a little bit of rant.

1032
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I'm sure everybody's heard about the digital rights management, how it's all fucked up,

1033
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
where you have a console that's basically three rings on you and content you purchased

1034
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
on there now you can no longer use on your new console unless you're logged in live.

1035
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It's really retarded that they do that in the first place.

1036
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I've had that problem because, of course, I have a new console, even though I fixed

1037
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
my own console.

1038
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It's funny.

1039
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It still doesn't work on my old console now either.

1040
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I don't know.

1041
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
It's all fucked up right now.

1042
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
My thing is, why isn't there a bit of lawsuit over that?

1043
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
That's something actually legitimate that they can have a lawsuit over instead of, you

1044
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
know, complaining about live outages or, you know, the three rings of death or whatever.

1045
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I think that they should sue them over the digital rights management and stuff because

1046
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
if you bought content online and now you can't use it because your system broke because

1047
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
they're faulty and Microsoft isn't doing anything about it.

1048
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Absolutely nothing.

1049
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
There's countless stories on the Internet about this stuff.

1050
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So why isn't anyone suing them over that?

1051
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That's why I want to ask.

1052
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I just want to give an F.U. to the antibiotic I'm on this week.

1053
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I can't remember the name of it.

1054
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It's like Leviquim or Leptixim or I don't know what it's called.

1055
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Some antibiotic a doctor gave me.

1056
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
A, it's a brand name drug so I have to pay more for it because they don't make it generic

1057
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
of it.

1058
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And B, it's the slowest antibiotic I've ever had.

1059
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I'm allergic to penicillin so also F.U. to the fact that I'm allergic to penicillin because

1060
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
then I can just take that and I'd be better in no time.

1061
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
But the antibiotic I'm on now is the slowest one I've ever taken and it was more expensive

1062
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
than C.Pro or any of the other ones I've taken before that are just fine.

1063
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And I know you're not supposed to take the same antibiotic because then you build up

1064
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
an antibiotic blah blah blah.

1065
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah, we just now have an insurance-resistant bacteria.

1066
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Is that it?

1067
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Leptixim?

1068
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Is that it?

1069
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I don't know what the hell it's called.

1070
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I can't remember.

1071
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So F.U. to my slow antibiotics.

1072
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And that's all my F.Us of the week.

1073
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Now you can go, Jamie.

1074
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Okay.

1075
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Well, I love Sega.

1076
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I mean, if you don't love Sega, you probably have something wrong with your head.

1077
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So, um, this is good news for people is that Sega Superstars Tennis will be a week early.

1078
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It was supposed to be on March 20th and it's going to be out a week before that.

1079
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So you have minigames and basically it's Virtua Tennis.

1080
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It has achievements on Xbox 360 that are named after older Sega games.

1081
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And you can play as a bunch of the Sega feet.

1082
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So that's pretty cool.

1083
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Cool.

1084
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You know, actually, it's kind of interesting.

1085
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Nolan Bushnell, you might remember him for making the game Pong, among other things.

1086
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And he is now working on an MMO-based title.

1087
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
No real clear answer on what exactly he's working on.

1088
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:25,000
They're going to be competing, obviously, with World of Warcraft.

1089
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It's unavoidable that the social and massively multiplayer games have become important.

1090
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Basically, I don't know, very vague on what he's working on.

1091
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
So, new multiplayer game, cool.

1092
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
What it is, no idea.

1093
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Didn't he, like, retire from the industry or something?

1094
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And he opened up his restaurant.

1095
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Nolan Bushnell brought a pizza hand here.

1096
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Which was Chuck E. Cheese.

1097
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And so did I.

1098
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Interesting.

1099
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
He was off the topic and he had stolen the right thing.

1100
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
They joke, though, in the article that it's massively multiplayer online Pong.

1101
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I doubt that.

1102
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
That would be pretty awesome.

1103
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I don't think that would be possible.

1104
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So, the drug is called Levaquin.

1105
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I looked it up.

1106
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And I just realized it's non-formulary.

1107
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That's why I pay it so much.

1108
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
So I see my doctor kind of prescribing me something that doesn't pay too much money for it.

1109
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Sorry, I just didn't get that out there.

1110
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Who cares about Pong guys and MMOs?

1111
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Oh, that Chuck E. Cheese is kind of awesome.

1112
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Have you been to a Chuck E. Cheese lately?

1113
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
They're really horrible now.

1114
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Decent salad bar, though.

1115
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,000
But, you know, when I was little, I had a Chuck E. Cheese that was massive.

1116
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
We had a big theater room.

1117
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It was this room that looked like a foyer to the bathroom that had glowing walls and shit.

1118
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
It had hands and feet on the walls that would clap.

1119
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And it had a party room with hippopotamus chicken.

1120
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Have you ever been to Bullwinkle's in the Bay Area?

1121
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
No.

1122
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It's like the old school Chuck E. Cheese.

1123
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
At least, I hope it still is.

1124
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Last time I was there, which was a long time ago, it still was.

1125
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And these were when Chuck E. Cheese was starting to do the new super neon edgy Chuck E. Cheese shit.

1126
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It was still like the 1980s Chuck E. Cheese Bullwinkle.

1127
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
But they have a little section where you can sit down.

1128
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And they have almost like one of those mini Vegas water show things where they have the fountain doing a little choreography and stuff like that.

1129
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Awesome.

1130
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
That's pretty cool.

1131
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I don't know how big Bullwinkle's of a chain they are, but, you know, I guess Rocky and Bullwinkle aren't that popular.

1132
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I kind of want to go check it out now.

1133
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
That'd be pretty cool.

1134
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Let me see if they're still even open.

1135
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Of course, there's always John's incredibly shitty pizza.

1136
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
You know what? I like some of his pizza.

1137
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
No, I know. It's a funny name. It's not a bad place.

1138
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But I really like having rice inside of a place.

1139
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
That is pretty fun.

1140
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Anyhow, one thing I like seeing inside a place is Street Fighter IV.

1141
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Unfortunately, I haven't seen any yet.

1142
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
But if you live in some places, they have been popping up.

1143
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And over at Wired.com, they did a pretty lengthy piece on Street Fighter IV's nostalgic allure, is what they called it.

1144
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But one interesting portion of it talked about that there is a possibility if and when there's console versions,

1145
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
possibly that some other characters may come in.

1146
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You don't say bonus characters and console versions.

1147
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
We haven't seen that before.

1148
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
But who they name is very interesting.

1149
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Sakura could come over from Street Fighter Alpha or Ibuki from Street Fighter III.

1150
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So that would be kind of interesting.

1151
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Why not both?

1152
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Why not both?

1153
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Or do the old one on the Xbox, one on the PlayStation 3. That's always fun.

1154
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I miss the old times unlock stuff.

1155
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I thought that was cool.

1156
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Because when I told the story before, I used to work for an AMCO arcade.

1157
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And when we had Tekken 3, that would be like, who's next?

1158
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And have an outline of them.

1159
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Because I was keeping up with the overseas releases.

1160
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I would come back and tell my boss who is next.

1161
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And I found that they switched the order for the US version.

1162
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Interesting.

1163
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So it was pretty funny.

1164
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I hope that if they're going to have release characters in this, they do something like that.

1165
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
So you sort of have to guess who it is or anticipate something that would add a little bit more excitement to it.

1166
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
You know what I mean?

1167
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Well, some new characters are already being spotted in Street Fighter IV arcade machines that are out there in the wild in the testing regions.

1168
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And Sagat and Balrog have now shown up in the game to only add bosses like old school Street Fighter II who cannot select them on the main select screen.

1169
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So, kind of interesting.

1170
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And by Balrog, it's who we had in Vega over here.

1171
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I'm not sure because I believe it is Boxer Balrog.

1172
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Because one of these machines I believe is in North America and that's one of the games that's in Street Fighter IV.

1173
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And Sagat?

1174
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Yeah.

1175
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I was looking at the little video.

1176
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
No, if you're right, it's the US version.

1177
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
So unfortunately, the link will just close down apparently.

1178
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It got converted into a night club called the Backbeat in late 1990s and it was closed in the mid 2000s.

1179
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It was in Santa Clara, California.

1180
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Animatronic animals are not really high-end of animals.

1181
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
There are some restaurants outside of California.

1182
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:37,000
There's one in Wilsonville, Oregon, Cary, North Carolina, Richmond, Virginia, Miamiburg, Ohio, and early North Carolina.

1183
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Hey, it was a cool place.

1184
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
It was pretty awesome.

1185
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
They had a ton of cool stuff there.

1186
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Also, just want to say really quickly, all those screenshots you can see in Street Fighter IV, they all seem like they're in that upgraded version of the Chun-Li phase.

1187
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So there are some of the battle locations out there.

1188
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Here's what's showing up.

1189
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
A drive-in at night, a beautiful day in South Asia, and an inland jungle in South America.

1190
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So some more battle regions are showing up.

1191
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I was looking at the movie that's up.

1192
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
It's the Sagat versus UNDF and just watching how fluid it is.

1193
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It's really cute.

1194
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
It really looks like it's captured a lot of the old feel of the older games.

1195
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I'm excited.

1196
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I'll definitely be checking this out when it comes out.

1197
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Arcade and console.

1198
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Now please let me know that I'm not at all excited about.

1199
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
What's that?

1200
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It's Road Rash.

1201
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Because I hate Road Rash.

1202
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
But my husband loves Road Rash.

1203
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So there has been a little bit let out that the Electronic Arts CEO is talking about doing another Road Rash, which is basically a game where your own motorcycles beat each other up.

1204
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Like we had that scene in Final Fantasy VII, where you go and beat people up.

1205
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Yeah, get in a Road Rash.

1206
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I remember that.

1207
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So someone actually let a few things slip about it coming out.

1208
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And that was actually in Road Sebastian Box.

1209
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:19,000
At a classic metal show, he said that one of his recent songs is going to be in...

1210
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And to quote Ashley said, it's a super heavy song.

1211
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It just got picked up for some video game.

1212
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Road Rage or Road Rash or something like that.

1213
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Dude, who would have thought that a big scoop in gaming would have come from Sebastian Bach?

1214
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And EA actually said that Road Rash is not currently in development.

1215
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But Road Rage, that's a whole different story.

1216
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Sebastian Bach is posturing me because he was rich.

1217
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
He did do a good rest.

1218
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Probably not deep.

1219
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And actually, it also is coming to the PlayStation Store as well.

1220
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
It's from Capcom.

1221
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And it looks like it's going to be available for 800 Microsoft points or $10

1222
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
or just $10 of real money on the PlayStation Network.

1223
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I haven't heard too much about this game.

1224
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
It doesn't look that great.

1225
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
But I don't know.

1226
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Tread them, at least.

1227
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
All right.

1228
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
This story is so cruel.

1229
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I don't know.

1230
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I feel like these parents, there's going to be a special place in hell for them.

1231
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
But apparently, here's what's happened.

1232
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
There's this YouTube floating around.

1233
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And there's this kid who got so excited because on Christmas Day,

1234
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:45,000
he opened up his presents under the tree and he got an Xbox 360.

1235
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
But unfortunately, here's what happened.

1236
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:54,000
The Xbox 360 just was a box that was stuffed with clothes.

1237
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
So the kid got clothes in an Xbox 360 box.

1238
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yes, there is video.

1239
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
This is so cruel.

1240
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I actually haven't even watched it.

1241
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
He's all excited.

1242
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It makes you want to cry.

1243
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Poor kid.

1244
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
He opens up the thing.

1245
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
He's like, oh, my God.

1246
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Xbox 360.

1247
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Hell, yeah.

1248
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Of course, I love you anyways, though.

1249
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Oh, I'm going to open it up.

1250
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
He's so excited.

1251
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Are you serious?

1252
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:38,000
This is so wrong.

1253
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I forget which blog, but they suggested a pile of parenting books shaped like a car.

1254
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And they're all laughing.

1255
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And the parents are laughing at the kid.

1256
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And we wonder why our kids end up so screwed up in school.

1257
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
That's fucked up.

1258
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
But it is very fucked up.

1259
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I don't know if you've heard about the news on this.

1260
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
In Gadget, they've offered to find the kid and they're going to give him a real life box 360.

1261
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
If he gets emancipated.

1262
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I threw the last part in there, but seriously.

1263
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
That's fucked up.

1264
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
This kid's going to be in the news later on after playing the Xbox 360.

1265
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Later on, he's going to kill his parents in the middle of the night because, you know, they're fucked up.

1266
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And she's like, oh, I can't afford an Xbox 360.

1267
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Yet you're an asshole enough to go out there and find an empty Xbox 360 box to fill clothes with.

1268
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
And they put it on the internet.

1269
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Oh, that's just fucked up.

1270
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Ag Def says, man, those parents are douches.

1271
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Frisbee says, look at me, I'm a big man, I can laugh at my own kid.

1272
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Ha ha ha ha.

1273
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Jamie, you're being awfully quiet.

1274
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I know you got a comment.

1275
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
What do you think?

1276
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Disgusting.

1277
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Yeah.

1278
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I don't think there's anything at all funny about it.

1279
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
That's just really disgusting.

1280
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
This is why we have kids that are just like, go to school and be done shit.

1281
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
You know?

1282
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Because their parents teach it to them.

1283
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I mean, what's a kid gonna think?

1284
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Seriously, my parents are assholes, that's what you're gonna think.

1285
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I mean, unless they just punked him with this and then like, you know, gave him the Xbox, you know, afterwards.

1286
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
You know, like pretend to always can't afford it.

1287
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:33,000
That's what I'm wondering is that maybe there's a second half where he actually got the Xbox later that none of us are seeing, but I don't know.

1288
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I doubt it.

1289
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Still.

1290
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Still.

1291
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
All right.

1292
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So that's all I have to say on that story.

1293
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Well, that's just, I mean, I really am absolutely disgusted by that.

1294
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I mean, really disgusted by that.

1295
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Anyway, in happier moods, I should say.

1296
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Penny Arcade is, they announced that Penny Arcade Xbox X is going to be August 21st, 2008 with the DigiPen Institute of Technology.

1297
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:20,000
So they're looking for ten independent developers that are being viewed by attendees and media and publishers.

1298
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:38,000
And there's actually a panel of 50, I guess, industry top people who will be selecting the ten submissions they consider going to be the best based on gameplay and fun factor.

1299
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And there's also going to be one that the audience gets to vote on.

1300
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
An Audience Choice Award.

1301
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
That's kind of a neat idea.

1302
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I like the whole idea of bringing some independent stuff to the forefront.

1303
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It's pretty nice.

1304
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah.

1305
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Props to these folks.

1306
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I would love to go to Penny Arcade Expo someday.

1307
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Maybe this will be my year.

1308
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Who knows?

1309
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
We'll see.

1310
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I'll try.

1311
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
All right.

1312
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
We're going to open up the Skype line very soon.

1313
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1314
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1315
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
But first, one more story.

1316
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I know this story is going to come as a shock to people.

1317
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:24,000
If it's seriously breaking news, folks, you're going to want to listen in.

1318
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
There's been a study.

1319
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,000
A study has been done that shows men like video games.

1320
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Shocking, I know.

1321
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You don't say.

1322
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Absolutely shocking.

1323
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,000
There's been a study, research that has been done by Frank N.

1324
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Looks like a legit associate.

1325
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I thought men like fixed cars and went to baseball games and that's what men did.

1326
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I always thought video games were like a female thing.

1327
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Didn't Oprah bring video games on her show and stuff?

1328
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I don't know.

1329
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Interesting.

1330
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It says, you know, apparently the study of 1,864 Americans showed that among males, overall

1331
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
console gaming came in third behind using the internet and watching TV.

1332
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I might have the internet and TV for both watching porn.

1333
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Among males 12 to 34, console gaming came in first and then dropped dramatically in

1334
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
older demographics.

1335
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I've been playing games until I die.

1336
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
The research shows women overall would rather talk on the phone, watch the DVD, listen to

1337
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
music or read a book before playing console games.

1338
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Oh, no.

1339
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,000
There is an odd spike among 18 to 24-year-old females for console gaming.

1340
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Three web-based games did better with females, particularly among women of mature age.

1341
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
No real shocking revelations, of course.

1342
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Act-deaf-con-chat says, LOL stereotypes.

1343
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
It makes me want to go play some fucking Half-Life.

1344
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Son-of-tat says, where was masturbation on the list?

1345
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
That must have been number four.

1346
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
No, that just is included with all the topics.

1347
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Yeah, you have to understand, they do everything alphabetically, so it's mad and then masturbation.

1348
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Janai says, read a book, read a book.

1349
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
It's almost like reading a book.

1350
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm thinking that there's probably a lot of women out there who like video games, too,

1351
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
and I think there's also a lot of men who don't like video games.

1352
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
I know that might be a shock to some people.

1353
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1354
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
His name is Skype.

1355
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Orange Mountain Radio.

1356
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
But first, we have some voicemails to catch up on.

1357
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Sometimes when we're not live, some of the folks who like to listen to our podcasts and

1358
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
so on, they like to leave us voicemails.

1359
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So, we want to get some of those out of the way real quick, so I'm going to start with this one.

1360
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Hi, guys.

1361
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I don't have a screening on your forum, but I'm known as Bezineater on the PlayStation Network,

1362
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and I'm also known as De'arra on Final Fantasy XI.

1363
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I just want to say to you guys, that's a great show.

1364
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I test it every week, and I think it has a couple of questions to you.

1365
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:33,000
First of all, if you're going to see any kind of rumors, it's equal to Final Fantasy XI,

1366
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:39,000
and if you provide any details, if you know any.

1367
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:26,380
Secondly, I heard that

1368
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
survival is a really great game and whatnot.

1369
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
We have something like 20 million players, give or take.

1370
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
But the thing is, though, I want to play it, but I don't have PC.

1371
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Is there any sense in how that he'll be coming to consoles anytime soon,

1372
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
specifically PlayStation 3?

1373
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:14,000
If he does, it'll be great, because right now my button-ups and my modes are really limited.

1374
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Any insights you guys have would be great. Thank you.

1375
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Thank you very much for the voicemail.

1376
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I'm thinking that where you're getting the impression that developers are working on the sequel

1377
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,000
is because it has come out that the people behind Final Fantasy XI, that team, is working on another MMO,

1378
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
but it hasn't been said what it is they're working on.

1379
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I think a lot of people are assuming it's Final Fantasy XI too,

1380
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
but I honestly think if they are going to make another MMO,

1381
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
it's not going to be Final Fantasy XIV or any of that.

1382
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
They may make a new MMO with some of the same concepts, but I don't know.

1383
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Would it sell as well without a Final Fantasy name? I don't know.

1384
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
A Kingdom Hearts MMO? Maybe. Who knows.

1385
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But there's nothing out there concrete at this time.

1386
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:04,000
You can probably bet that they'll try to crank at least one more expansion out of Final Fantasy XI before it's done.

1387
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I know some people said this last one that came out, the...

1388
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
the Prime one, not Precious of Honor again, but the one that just came out. Why can't I remember the name?

1389
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Williams of the Goddess?

1390
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Thank you very much. Williams of the Goddess.

1391
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
A lot of people said this in the last one. I don't know.

1392
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I think if they did like 12 expansions forever, but I think they could get at least one more out of this, I think.

1393
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,000
At least to hold the Final Fantasy XI fans over until the real sequel comes out, but I don't know.

1394
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Nothing concrete isn't said. Anything you hear out there is speculation alone.

1395
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
One more voice mail for you guys.

1396
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I miss you guys. It was a plus.

1397
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Oh, and here's what I did on Sunday since I couldn't listen.

1398
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I... I had an equation set up at the clock and I said it was eight my time.

1399
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:28,000
So I threw a random episode in my playlist and listened to it like I was listening to it.

1400
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I... I can't really recall the episode number up here, but it was fucking hilarious.

1401
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I'm thinking he has the reverse cage match in it.

1402
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
This show's never coming.

1403
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I'm sure many of you know what it is.

1404
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I'm kind of paranoid that somebody's going to jack my computer while I'm not looking.

1405
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,000
So I'm going to go ahead and say bye and with luck I should see you all on Sunday. Bye!

1406
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Couple comments from chat. Rama says,

1407
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Sounds like she's walking and talking. I kind of agree.

1408
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Sj100matt says, Is Misty the first PSP Sky caller? I believe she is.

1409
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I was trying to be number one, but I had the wrong...

1410
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
You got beat!

1411
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
No, that's definitely one reason I wanted to play that is because that would be the first PSP call we've gotten.

1412
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
So there you have it.

1413
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Unless she was lying.

1414
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
No, I don't think she's lying.

1415
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Because it came through with her name. She definitely made that call on Skype.

1416
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And from the way it sounded, she was definitely outdoors. She was not by a computer.

1417
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
That was pretty bad quality for her.

1418
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yeah, it wasn't bad quality for a call.

1419
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
A. I think it's cute she was nerdy. I love it when people get nervous and they don't know what to say.

1420
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Because I'm like, we're just dumb kids like all the rest of you, so I don't know why.

1421
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
But I guess sometimes it's hard when you're not getting the feedback.

1422
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Or at least our live callers get that live feedback where we can kind of tell them.

1423
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
But yeah, I think that's really neat that she puts on the old episodes.

1424
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
We do need to release more of the old episodes.

1425
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
One of those projects I'll never get to.

1426
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Anyhow, let's open up the Skypline for all y'all.

1427
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
It's now wide open for everybody to call in.

1428
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1429
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
username on Skype once again.

1430
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

1431
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And after we do the Skypline tonight, we'll be getting some last minute phone calls.

1432
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Not last minute phone calls, last minute stories.

1433
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I've been doing this far too long.

1434
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Last minute stories you need?

1435
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Yeah.

1436
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Let's go ahead and take a call.

1437
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1438
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Legend of Dr.

1439
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I love Legend of Dr. What's on your mind?

1440
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Nah, just chillin' right here recovering from the heat that I got from clubbin' like a saint.

1441
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
But that's besides the point.

1442
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Just wanted to probably point out the whole clusterfuck that Nintendo has created as a result of their attempts to create an online multiplayer.

1443
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
What is your thoughts on that?

1444
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It's just bullshit, man. It's not bad.

1445
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I mean, it's bad enough when people like me have to wait in front of like 10, 20, 30 guys outside of Nintendo World every morning just to get the school week.

1446
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And then, you know, if you take it home, you realize that, you know, there's barely an online multiplayer experience to begin with.

1447
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
But what about the children, Daku? What about the children?

1448
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Well, that's playing through the Disney book. You know, the soccer mom book.

1449
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
But, you know...

1450
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Who is buying Wii's, Daku? Soccer mom?

1451
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Of course. That's the demographic.

1452
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:51,000
And they're playing the Disney card because, you know, think about what would happen, you know, if someone were to catch them off guard by trying to do something that allowed, you know, the other players to basically, you know, to curse in a magic standard like they do on Xbox Live.

1453
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
It would be a shit-toll.

1454
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
You know, Xbox News, for example, would just, you know, spin the shit out of the Wii image.

1455
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:06,000
The dark side of the Nintendo Wii, where these young children are being, their eyes are being raped by the hideous voice chat inside Mario Kart Wii.

1456
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
How do these raise your children tonight on Fox?

1457
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:21,000
If you're basically playing Mario Kart, you know, with voice chat or anything like that, you know, the only thing I'm worried about is ad-hoc.

1458
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And, you know, ad-hoc is just ruining the experience for everyone.

1459
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:37,000
But at the same time, you know, it's like, if you put the right security measures on it, like, you know, I am totally fine with Nintendo saying, no communication between strangers, period.

1460
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:47,000
But with the whole Franco thing, you know, I would think that, you know, once you have the Franco, then you should be able, if you want to say fucking shit, you should be able to do that.

1461
01:26:47,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Right, I mean, I don't know. I guess that kind of, you know, that kind of goes, you know, kind of basically takes away, if not, you know, goes in a different direction in terms of, you know, the typical matchmaking done on other places.

1462
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Yeah, I mean, yeah, that might be one thing, but I don't know if it'd be enough to throw the fuse or something.

1463
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Okay, quick question, Zach, and quick question, then we gotta wrap up.

1464
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:24,000
G.S. 68 says, and he's quoting something he said earlier in chat, he said, you say the Xbox Live, they say, you know, N-I-G, blah, blah, blah, F-A, blah, blah, blah, and all that they say on Xbox Live, yet you bitch about Nintendo's online.

1465
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,000
So, what's the answer? Because Xbox is too much, Nintendo is not enough. What's the answer?

1466
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I don't know, I mean, look, think about it. I mean, you can mute, in Xbox Live, I know you can mute people, right, and even though Nintendo is basically doing the mute for you, you don't even have that option to sign with other, like, rude, obnoxious players.

1467
01:27:48,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I mean, it's just basically, it's boiled down to a Disney-type level, where it's just, you know, this is what you can't, you know, these are the phrases you can't, you know, you can't say, and they just, you know, they can only work.

1468
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Okay, here's my last question for you, Zachu. As much as you or I may hate to admit it, is this change, is this revelation about the online thing and Mario Kart online, is it gonna affect sales?

1469
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I doubt it. I mean, most people, I mean, you know, most people won't leave it, and I doubt that many people even take advantage of all, you know, the online features anyways.

1470
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I mean, some will, but I think of Mario Kart as something you would share amongst friends, you know, with food and liquor and stuff like that.

1471
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And it's not just a social video game conference, that's, you know, that's ahead of the fields of your audience and the 360 and PS3 combined.

1472
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Right. I think you are right, Zachu. I don't think it's gonna affect sales at all. We gotta let you go, Zachu. Thank you so much for the call. Good to hear from you.

1473
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I hope you heard the bonus statement tonight, by the way. There was some very exciting news for you in there.

1474
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:04,000
1-877-GAMEL, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1475
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Hi, this is Act Deaf in Chat.

1476
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Hi, Act Deaf in Chat. How are you? What's on your mind, buddy?

1477
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Just talking about, everyone talk about the thing you talked about in the bonus segment about the March Madness, the DMN is urbanizing?

1478
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Yes, and just so our podcast listeners know, since they don't always get to hear the bonus statement, because we do something bonus.

1479
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:34,000
DMN, one of our weeknight shows, I believe there's a show on Wednesdays, The Insanest Hour, he is putting together the top 64.

1480
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:40,000
He's doing this March Madness thing with the 64 games, going face-off against each other, all the listeners submitted in their list.

1481
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
And during the bonus segment tonight, the hosts voted on their favorite.

1482
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So that being said, I just want to get some background there, Act Deaf. What did you want to say on that?

1483
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:59,000
You and Loki made a vote for one of the brackets. It was Ocarina of Time and Derby Superstar.

1484
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yes.

1485
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I want to say that I'm with you. So not for the same reason, but just because I do think that Derby Superstar is a better game than Ocarina of Time.

1486
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Yeah, here's the thing. Loki and I made a controversial vote during the bonus segment and this whole thing.

1487
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:27,000
We voted for Kirby Superstar over Ocarina of Time, and both of us said it's because basically we both agree that Ocarina of Time is one of the most, by the gaming community in general, overrated games there is.

1488
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I've tried playing it and I can't stand it.

1489
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
When Zelda wins 3D for me, it just didn't work.

1490
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Even Wind Waker, or not Wind Waker. Wind Waker is fine. I like Wind Waker and I like Zelda for the DS.

1491
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
But I don't like, you know...

1492
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
It's not that I think it's a bad game.

1493
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I don't care for the more mature looking Link. I don't like the 3D ones that are on Nintendo 64 and I didn't really get into...

1494
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And I just love the Super Nintendo ones so, so much. It's one of my favorite games of all time. Seriously.

1495
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Maybe it's not solid talking but for me Kirby Superstar is the better game there because Kirby Superstar is like many games in one. Many adventure games, also multiplayer games.

1496
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And basically, although the story in it, or many stories in it, aren't as deep as Ocarina of Time, so you can have a better time playing it.

1497
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And even replaying it, like Great Table Planet is one of the games there.

1498
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It's basically an adventure game that you find treasures.

1499
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I think there's like 100 treasures you have to find and it's very difficult to do it in one simple run. You have to replay it again and again to get there.

1500
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Act out, but maybe you just want to admit that maybe a little bit you're just a Kirby fanboy.

1501
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Maybe. So, I do like Ocarina of Time and maybe it's one of my favorite games of all time but...

1502
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I just want to make that point that maybe Ocarina of Time is not that great of a game.

1503
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It's not all that in a bag of chips.

1504
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I'm sure there's many people out there that disagree, but you know what? That's the reason I love doing this show is because everybody has a different opinion.

1505
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And we have ours and I'm sure many of you have been asked in emails we did this week about how we hate Ocarina of Time. It isn't true. We like it.

1506
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Yeah, different strokes for different people.

1507
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Exactly. If you want to put it that way, then fine.

1508
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Alright, Act out any other comments you have for our listeners tonight.

1509
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I want to say that I already got my ticket for video games live, so in two weeks I'm going to see it.

1510
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Will we expect a full report?

1511
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
You will.

1512
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Alright, sounds good. Take care Act out, have fun with video games live. We don't talk to you before that.

1513
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Same.

1514
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:06,000
If you want to give us a call, we'll take one more call. 877-GAMELAR.

1515
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
The call's coming back to back tonight. Hi, Aaron. Who's this?

1516
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Hey, hey, it's Ronald.

1517
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Wow, you got through. What do you own in Zaku and Raven's Dolphin? What is it that you guys have to get you in the chat before anybody else?

1518
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
A fast trigger finger.

1519
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I guess so. You guys are good. Alright, well what's on your mind, Ronald?

1520
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Well, a couple of things about the whole of Nintendo online thing. Well, I don't blame them for setting up the preset text chat and all that, but when friends get together and play, it is the most rowdy-ness ever.

1521
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I mean, really, if I'm going to play Mario Kart Wii online with my friends, I'm left to curse like a sailor. I want to say this, I want to say that.

1522
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Me too.

1523
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yes, I would.

1524
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Me too. The weird thing is that thanks to technology, I'm still going to do that, whether it be this whole Ventrilo thing or the, I love the idea of, I think it was even Loki or Chatter that said it.

1525
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:11,000
You sign on to the Xbox 360 and do your chat on the 360 and then play the Wii.

1526
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Well, for me, I'll just bring my laptop next to the Wii and I'll just put my headset on and just like, everyone goes back there. Let's just go, you know?

1527
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Do you think maybe that's it? Do you think Nintendo maybe knows that, you know what, those people don't fucking care. They're all about, you know, coddling the family to make sure.

1528
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I'm just trying to be double-degged.

1529
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I think it tends to be on the fact that they're a quote-unquote family company, family gaming console and stuff like that, you know?

1530
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
They're scared shitless about online is what it is.

1531
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,000
It's pretty genuine chat, but it's more fun when it's multiplayer offline.

1532
01:34:45,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Honestly, when I get Mario Kart Wii, I'm going to be too busy hosting racing parties at my house and trying to get my Wii online and sit in a lobby, call my friends and get into the chat room and to the lobby where we can all play together.

1533
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,000
You know what though, I gotta say though, Janine, sometimes that's not an option though.

1534
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You know, one of the beautiful things about the internet is that it brings you together. One reason I'm so obsessed with WoW to the point you guys make fun of me over it is that I get to play with some of my friends I don't see on a regular basis.

1535
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:23,000
For instance, one of my closest friends lives in Kansas, so we play that way and we also have a guy in our guild who's from Idaho who's hilarious.

1536
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And yeah, there's a bunch of local people on there too, but we have a good time, you know, just laughing and playing the game and all that.

1537
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:41,000
You know, a lot of our listeners, you know, we get to play games on DS sometimes, I get to play with people in New York City and all that stuff. So, you know, sometimes the internet really helps fill in that void and you can't have people on the couch.

1538
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
True, true.

1539
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Alright, any other thoughts, Rambo, before I let you go?

1540
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Yeah, a couple of things, but number one, remember when you said earlier about a Hello Kitty PlayStation 3?

1541
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Yes.

1542
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I thought you had a thing for Batch Maroon.

1543
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:04,000
It is the Batch Maroon thing, not a Hello Kitty thing, but I've just accepted the fact that people are just going to loop it all in the same thing and when I say Batch Maroon is Sanrio, they're going to go, oh, you like Hello Kitty.

1544
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Plus there's the whole fact that I have the toaster and the coffee maker, which doesn't help.

1545
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:16,000
They don't make, like, if they came out with a Batch Maroon toaster, I would sell that thing, my Hello Kitty wanted to garage sale so quick and replace it, but they just, they don't do it.

1546
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
No love for penguins.

1547
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:25,000
So does my sister, they had the Hello Kitty AR-15 that came back.

1548
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
You know, I was surprised no one got me the waffle maker for Christmas.

1549
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:34,000
So many people said they were going to give me the waffle maker, but it was one of those things where I think no one wanted to buy it because they all thought everyone else was getting it.

1550
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Which is funny.

1551
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:51,000
And before I go, when I went to chapter five a couple of weeks ago, a couple of interesting things. Number one, in the game room, they had a 32 inch HDTV set up, went to the Atari 7800, playing Mario Brothers.

1552
01:36:51,000 --> 01:37:04,000
That's fucking hardcore. You know, I have to admit, I have to admit, when I was at the record store this weekend that also sells the old games, and I saw some of the games that they had on the 2600, like combat and warlords and all that stuff.

1553
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And I was like, man, how fun would it be just for one day to hook up the Atari 2600 games to the TV, the big HDTV, and just have a brawl.

1554
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Brawl.

1555
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
What?

1556
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Come over.

1557
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
We'll hook up the 5200.

1558
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Let's just TV that shit.

1559
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I want to actually have the 5200 hooked up because even though the controllers broke really easily, I would totally love to get like a Kix game going on.

1560
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Oh, good times.

1561
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I want some epic Kaboom.

1562
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Actually, not a game, I really love.

1563
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I want some HD Kaboom.

1564
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I love kangaroo.

1565
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
We need to do that one weekend.

1566
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
And leave us.

1567
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I think one weekend, we need to just marathon the shit out of old school Atari games.

1568
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Why don't we do this? How about twice a month, or you know, we can manage the time.

1569
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
We pick an old console, hook that shit up and play it.

1570
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
You're talking old console, or you're talking twice a month.

1571
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
You're talking about my, you know, vault in my house.

1572
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Yeah, I know.

1573
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
It does need to get played.

1574
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
It does.

1575
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I think we can do it for click-a-vision and television.

1576
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Let's make it happen. Let's not let this go the way the Super Metroid thinks.

1577
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
We set a time, we set a date, and we do it.

1578
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I bring it over to Justin's TV cam so the chatters can enjoy it too.

1579
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
We'll point it at the TV and just go to town.

1580
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Let's do it.

1581
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Let's do it. When?

1582
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Okay, we can't set a time right now because we have to consult our calendars, but Rama, you're in charge of bitching at us until it happens.

1583
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Well, this isn't early April.

1584
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
All right.

1585
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
We will do.

1586
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
We have to wait that long?

1587
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Well, because I'm not able to do with content.

1588
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Oh, that's right.

1589
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
And I'm getting shot in the head next, not just right at the neck.

1590
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
All right, so Rama, you stay on our asses until it happens, all right?

1591
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
That's what I will do.

1592
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
All right.

1593
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
We gotta let you go, Rama.

1594
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
All right, most of our game is in the game room.

1595
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
My match club is Brawl.

1596
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Out of all the hot games, everybody was online from Brawl.

1597
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
All my best friends came and were screaming.

1598
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Oh, my God.

1599
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Brawl was so good.

1600
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
It was so good.

1601
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I'm like, dude, relax.

1602
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Over your room.

1603
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Change your underwear.

1604
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Go back to play, okay?

1605
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Relax.

1606
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
The line was like going all over the place.

1607
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Yes, you had data.

1608
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Everybody was there to play Brawl.

1609
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
This game isn't clear.

1610
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
At least 500 copies per se.

1611
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
But you know what?

1612
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
You were looking at Brawl's target audience at that place, you know what I mean?

1613
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Of course, all the people that go to anime concerts are excited about Brawl.

1614
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Most of them are Nintendo fanboys.

1615
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
But still, I mean, you have people my age going, let's go to the forest.

1616
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
It's gonna be huge, stellar.

1617
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I'm not doubting you on that, Rama.

1618
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
It's gonna be huge, stellar.

1619
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
We gotta let you go.

1620
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
This call's going on for very, very long.

1621
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
But thank you so much, as always.

1622
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Take care, everybody.

1623
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Sorry.

1624
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
This is getting to seven minutes.

1625
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I'm trying to keep them at four minutes now.

1626
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
One more call.

1627
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
We're wrapping up.

1628
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Let's see.

1629
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
How far are we in the show?

1630
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I think we gotta wrap up.

1631
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
That's just part B.

1632
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Cause the bonus there.

1633
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Bonus statement tonight was 15 minutes.

1634
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
It's 9.30 here.

1635
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
We gotta end this shit.

1636
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
So, that being said, quickly, Loki, any last minute stories?

1637
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Yes.

1638
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I have last minute stories for you.

1639
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Alright.

1640
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Okay.

1641
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Lego MMO.

1642
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
We know and love that they have coming out.

1643
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
What's cool about it is if you build stuff in the game, you can actually hit a button,

1644
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
much like you can in Spore, and they will spit out a kit that will actually be shipped

1645
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
to your house where you can build stuff in the game.

1646
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:23,000
That's pretty awesome.

1647
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Wow.

1648
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
That's kinda neat.

1649
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
You don't know Jack has become part of Yahoo Games.

1650
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Oh, I'm so sad that missed the cut tonight.

1651
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
That is very exciting news.

1652
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I'm very excited about that.

1653
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Is it up now?

1654
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Can you play it?

1655
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Yes, it is up now.

1656
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Shut up.

1657
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I don't know what I'm doing tonight.

1658
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I'm not sure.

1659
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Resident Evil Zero is coming to the Wii in Japan to support the GameCube thing and much

1660
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
like...

1661
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Yeah.

1662
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Anyway.

1663
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:00,240
A Finnish company, or Finnish stopper company, called FutureMark Game Studio has filed papers

1664
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,240
to trademark pwnage.

1665
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:06,000
Yes, they're trying to trademark pwnage.

1666
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Was they gonna put it on shirts and stuff?

1667
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I don't know why.

1668
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Interesting.

1669
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Let's see.

1670
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Then, the PlayStation Store is apparently gonna be overhauled in April.

1671
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:23,000
It's gonna look more like the Things Store, which, you know, a little different, a little

1672
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
bit easier to navigate.

1673
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
So that's kinda cool.

1674
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
So we'll get for that in April there.

1675
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
And this will be Arcade Stage 4 is headed to PS3.

1676
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
That's pretty cool.

1677
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Wow.

1678
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
This is not a game I'm gonna be importing, though.

1679
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I learned my lesson the first time.

1680
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Did the other Initial D games come out on console?

1681
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I don't think they ever did.

1682
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
They're not here.

1683
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Even here.

1684
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And they have Initial D on the PSP as well.

1685
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Strange.

1686
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
And lastly...

1687
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I have a PS3 one.

1688
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Hmm.

1689
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Lastly, to piss off people even more, a guy named Vandal had an Xbox 360 which he had

1690
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:01,000
signed by team members from the budget staff, Xbox 360 team members.

1691
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
There's even a sketch of Spartans done by the Rooster Teeth guy.

1692
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Anyways, his 360 died and had the free ring, so he sent it in to get sick.

1693
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
He even, you know, took precautions of asking them, hey, you know, can you send this back

1694
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
to me in the same case?

1695
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
If not, you know, can you make sure you put the new case on the new system?

1696
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
That kind of stuff.

1697
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Well, he gets it back.

1698
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Serial numbers match and everything, but they rubbed off the Sharpie, you know, drawing

1699
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
was on the case.

1700
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
It's not a new case.

1701
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
It's actually the old case and they literally rubbed it off.

1702
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
You can see parts where the Sharpie marker is still there.

1703
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Somebody didn't get the memo.

1704
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Why would they do that in the first place?

1705
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Why would you rub something off?

1706
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I mean, that's just being a dick is what that is.

1707
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
And no one else that didn't make a cut.

1708
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:00,000
The singing store is also going to be getting 67 songs in the next update, which I believe

1709
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
is supposed to happen in April as well.

1710
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:07,000
The only problem is those 67 songs weren't all the other King Star games, so it's nothing

1711
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
new.

1712
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Alright, well, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1713
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
George Parker, we'll start with you tonight.

1714
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Your final thoughts.

1715
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Tired.

1716
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
My final thought is wine is good.

1717
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Plum wine was good.

1718
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
What's your final thought?

1719
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
My final thought is I'm still working on that 360.

1720
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
It's still being a seller.

1721
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Alright, well, after our amazing February of fail, we hope March has been a good month

1722
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
to you guys so far.

1723
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I think it was a good show tonight.

1724
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I do think it was a good show tonight.

1725
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So thank you everybody for tuning in and supporting us and supporting independent radio and independent

1726
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000

You guys are awesome and you know we only do this every week for you guys that continue

1728
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
to support us.

1729
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
We, you know, we don't charge or any of that stuff for the show.

1730
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
So if you like what you hear, just tell two friends.

1731
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
That's all we ask.

1732
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio and that'll keep us motivated to come back

1733
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
next week where there will be more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1734
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Until then, I'm Rob.

1735
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
She's Dark Sakura.

1736
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
That's Loki.

1737
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
We'll see you next week.

1738
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
