487	19082	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
20307	24869	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Easter Sunday, March 23rd of 2008.
26589	28530	We are live here in the studio.
28610	30971	We had some unfortunate news a little earlier on.
31011	39274	If you haven't heard it yet, go back and listen to Part A. Big changes coming to OLR very soon, and hopefully next week we'll have more information on that for you.
39314	43775	But in the meantime, the show goes on, and it will go on as it always has.
43936	47857	And it will go on right now with Loki spreading the rumors.
48655	49396	Dark Horse Pick
78000	81742	Copiers, Plagiarists How do they know it's in the works?
81762	83203	I don't fucking know, nor do I care
101465	104027	I don't know, I think you underestimate the fanboys I'm
123089	125391	I would say that it'd be cool if a Kid Icarus game came out.
125492	127073	I don't think it's the game he's talking about.
127474	137144	I think Animal Crossing is the game he's talking about, but if there is a Kid Icarus game in the works, I mean, they'll be pretty big, but I don't think it is the game that they're going to be announcing.
138724	140585	I think it could be a game they're announcing.
140705	141786	Yeah, a game, yes.
142146	143046	The game, no.
164717	174524	Nintendo of America's history dating all the way back to the NES and you know no surprise this game was going to be a big seller but this was a like really big seller.
176666	183671	The game is sold at a rate of more than 120 units per minute between the day it launched March 9th and March 16th.
185802	187303	So that is a huge selling game.
187783	190524	And Ross2UT, though, is the first to point out.
191165	192726	He's Debbie Downer UT right now.
192786	194707	He says, still slower than Halo 3.
198168	200330	But, I mean, it is kind of a good point.
201350	204532	It didn't sell quite as much as some of the guys on Xbox did.
205272	207213	But still a huge seller for Nintendo, nonetheless.
207814	208074	Yeah.
209354	214357	And also you have to remember, too, I mean, that they don't have as many units of the Wii yet.
215276	219358	Right now, as of the 360, they're still number two in the U.S.
220419	224181	But, I mean, not by much, so that doesn't really make a big difference.
224281	227343	Is it a big deal that it didn't meet up to those Halo 3 type numbers?
227643	236928	No, I don't think they were ever, you know, I mean, it's, you know, it made history for Nintendo, so I think that they're more than pleased about it.
237409	237969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
259096	264444	All right, so going back to the story earlier about Kid Icarus, would it be a game that people would recognize or not?
264964	266026	This is a huge game.
266126	267648	Pit is a character in the game.
268009	271594	It does a good job at kind of reminding you that Kid Icarus is out there.
271654	274678	What with the virtual console thing and the stages and the music.
275259	275800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
301147	302409	You know what they need to... No.
302889	304611	You know what they need to do with Rob the Robot?
304651	310297	They need to make it, like, one of those fucking, you know, RoboSapien things, or, like, fucking Furbies, where you can program the shit out of that.
310377	312280	Or the, uh, what, Ibo?
312620	313261	Ibo, yeah.
313881	315123	Just, like, something like that.
315183	316945	Just, like, really crazy, you know...
318110	322531	Get people to buy that shit that wouldn't have a Wii or something like that and just go crazy with it.
322871	325831	But, I mean, I don't know about you guys, but, like, when I was playing Smash Bros.
325851	336613	Brawl and I played that subspace emissary mode and I saw the Kid Icarus thing and with the music and him flying through the air, flying down to Earth, and with the music playing, I'm like, God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game now.
336853	338914	Like, that was initially the first thought in my mind.
338994	347215	And I think we might have even been broadcasting on Justin.TV when I was doing that in the game and I seem to remember exclaiming, God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game right now.
348066	348646	Make a new one.
350347	350667	Maybe.
351367	351887	I hope so.
353548	358369	TigerClaw says if they do the new Kid Icarus, it's no doubt that they would also have to bring back the Eggplant Wizard.
358990	359870	Hell yes.
359930	362311	The Eggplant Wizard was also a very memorable character.
362871	366672	Everybody knew him as the annoyingest little fucker in video gaming history.
366992	368613	One of the most annoying characters, seriously.
368633	370673	You know what's great, though, about being turned into an eggplant, though?
370793	370994	What?
371334	375435	Is that if you press down to where you can see his feet and then you slide across the floor as an eggplant.
375455	375515	Yes.
376388	378590	It's like Metal Gear Solid Eggplant.
379250	380030	It's great.
380070	380791	I know, I love that too.
380811	382232	You just hope that nothing saw you.
382932	386514	And you can even hold it down and jump as an eggplant, and that was great too.
387114	390656	And who knew that hospitals could cure the eggplant curse?
391217	391757	I know.
392638	396520	Although, you could also turn into an eggplant from watching too much TV.
397935	398555	This is true.
399135	401816	Well, anyhow, huge numbers for Smash Bros.
401856	406897	Brawl, and I'm sure this game's just going to continue to sell through Christmas, so we'll see how it holds up throughout the year.
408158	422561	Well, in other news... Okay, well... We know we were talking about how Namco was talking about, you know, not too many people are playing their games.
422942	424402	Well, I should say Bandai Namco.
425874	430355	But now they're talking about, actually they also blamed it on the Wii too, which I think is kind of stupid.
431115	449340	But now they're talking about bringing out games that will combine the arcade and Wii titles to where I guess they'll share scores or that they'll have some sort of interactivity, but it would be for a data exchange between the different versions of the games.
449740	452261	And you know what I have to say about that, Neo Geo?
452281	454141	And you know what I have to say about that?
454602	459286	F-Zero GX And you know what I have to say about that?
460867	463088	Nothing, I just wanted to join in.
464089	482623	No, seriously though, I mean, they were part of the whole Triforce system that, you know, I think that was only pretty much used for the F-Zero GX stuff, but, you know, it had cross-platform stuff between the arcade and the GameCube, so let's do something similar with SD memory cards, because those are widely available.
482663	482883	Fuck.
483601	486282	I think it's smart to make arcades like a gamer's hub.
501926	514472	And I know that kind of sounds like a big duh type of answer, but I think it's smart to kind of make your arcade games somehow talk to the console games and give gamers a reason to sort of convene in one place, in real life, outside.
514852	517893	You know, not having to use Xbox Live and rely on that type of stuff.
517993	519494	I think these kind of ideas are smart.
519514	520815	Can you imagine like a Smash Bros.
520835	525237	arcade game or something like that, like done on a huge screen, you know, with four...
526397	531119	Joy6, you know, set up and stuff and they have like additional characters and all that stuff.
531480	534221	Or things that unlock based on what you do on the home version.
534461	534601	Yeah.
534621	535261	Cool things like that.
536062	536542	Absolutely.
537443	538123	That would be rad.
538623	541705	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Loki, one could dream.
542565	543566	I agree, one could dream.
545687	547848	So we'll see what happens with this.
548768	554311	Another cool thing that probably will never come to fruition, but you know, at least with all the
555214	556174	Buzz that's going around about it.
556194	564456	But a fan of Metroid 2 is actually working on a remake of the game that he's been working on right now for about three years now.
564516	567257	Metroid 2 Return of Samus.
568537	569197	Awesome looking thing.
569237	577079	He's using sprites from Metroid Zero Mission as well as the remake of the classic Game Boy game.
577919	579320	And some other sprites.
579360	581900	He's also hand drawing from the ground up.
582060	584641	I guess Metroid Fusion was the other game he was using.
585325	590988	and using the program GameMaker7, the guy who goes by DrM64.
591989	595451	And totally awesome looking game so far.
596251	606977	They've actually got a, I guess, not really a beta or demo, but a proof of concept demo, I guess, that you can download and play straight off of a bunch of websites.
607037	613000	And if you're interested in checking it out, it's Metroid2Remake.blogspot.com for the website.
613701	616683	And we have a little YouTube that Tiger Claw sent us of this in action.
620146	621647	Neat, looks like Super Metroid.
626150	629112	I imagine that's not the sound in-game.
629193	632615	No, they actually do have an in-game... I don't think this is it, though, is it?
632695	636718	No, that's the actual game, but that's not the... Damn, the game looks good, though.
636818	637979	It looks like Super Metroid.
640861	641642	That's not a bad thing.
644871	645971	Nice, wall jumping.
648972	649552	I approve.
649712	651873	This looks good.
651893	656353	Yeah, I hope the project doesn't get shut down by the way it ends up.
656393	657014	It would do, yeah.
657054	658474	So there you have it.
662975	665595	Macman says, oh shit, I thought it was going to be a Rickroll.
665955	667876	No, I trust Tigerclaw's links.
668016	669876	Some of you other people, I don't know so much.
669976	673377	I might get Rickrolled by you, so don't think I'm...
674236	675877	Rick Roll, you get blacklisted.
675897	677757	That's right, you Rick Roll me, I ban you.
679918	681699	That shit was funny like three months ago.
681759	685200	It's a little old now, so please do not be Rick Rollin'.
685540	687501	Anyhow, Metroid 2, yes, I approve.
688481	691062	And I hope the project doesn't get Rick Rolled by lawyers.
691242	691622	That would suck.
691642	695164	Just like, was it the 3D remake of Chrono Trigger?
696524	698565	Yeah, that's, oh, that thing looked hot, too.
699209	700870	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
726980	734805	Nintendo Mii's, as in the characters that you create on Wii's, were being used to advertise Easter service at a San Francisco church.
735225	735845	Yes, that's right.
735865	742409	They used a little Mii that looks like Jesus standing next to a bunny that looks a little grumpy.
742830	747573	And the little postcard says, Come and follow me, Mii.
747933	750734	And it was Easter Sunday, which was today at 11 a.m.
750774	752395	at the Mission Bay Community Church.
753056	753196	So...
754199	757360	Just clever ways of advertising.
757380	759500	I like churches that are hip and with it.
760121	763641	I like churches that don't feel like they're still living in the Old Testament.
763661	767662	Did you see the one that was the wedding invitation that had the two me's on there?
767682	768443	No, I don't think I saw that.
768463	770483	And then when you open it up, it says, Wife Get.
772504	773324	That's awesome.
776445	777085	That's awesome.
778205	782386	That sounds like something that Mel and Mel, my buddies, would be doing for their weddings.
783297	784478	That's like something they would do.
786278	786559	Nice.
790300	791861	That actually, yeah.
792381	793141	That is very cute.
793482	795563	I like cute, innovative ways of doing things.
797223	797924	All right, bless you.
798244	798764	Are you okay?
799264	802206	I'm allergic to... Something here in the studio?
802246	802986	Are you allergic to me?
803206	804166	Are you allergic to Jesus?
804246	805107	That might be a problem.
806688	807068	Mildly.
807308	807528	All right.
808561	816463	Well, hopefully you're not allergic to mail, because this is the part of the show where you're going to read some for us as the listeners email us at mailbag at orangezonsradio.com.
818763	821004	Did we get better participation this week than last week?
821864	827505	Well, we did get some interesting emails, and one of them is from our friend Rob with two Bs.
828305	831166	But he didn't provide the link to the article in the email.
831986	838167	So he's basically just talking about an article about the outcome of the guy who... I'm just going to read this from the start.
838863	844165	Here's a pretty good article on the outcome of that guy who bludgeoned a baby to death for accidentally breaking the Xbox.
844946	846446	Some interesting stuff in that article.
847547	851348	One, the article does not imply the guy was playing his Xbox at the time.
852069	857731	Two, the article does not specify if the murder happened immediately after the Xbox broke or when Spellman, the convicted, discovered it.
858171	861013	Three, social workers visited the house regularly.
861553	864154	And four, the autopsy showed evidence of prior abuse.
865117	868860	It implies a pattern of abuse that shows the man was a ticking time bomb.
869560	873243	As you said when the story probably came out, it wasn't really about games at all.
877566	878387	Exactly.
880548	887153	It's no surprise that the media hopped all over this trying to make it a video game thing when it really had nothing to do with that.
887673	888474	No surprise there.
890015	891296	But thanks for the update, nevertheless.
891336	892177	I'm not saying that at you.
892237	894018	I'm just saying that in general, like,
894721	896202	There it goes, the media again.
896262	897402	Video games are evil.
898183	899603	Big surprise.
899984	907327	Also, Naj linked me a story on CBBC that is actually pretty cool.
907447	919233	It's more just pictures of a bunch of people, a lot of people dressed up as Mario, but also others dressed up as different characters.
919253	922155	There's a giant Spyro here, which is a very well-made costume.
922575	922735	Just
923579	924380	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
945233	957156	Speaking of anime conventions, I was told via a text message earlier this week, I don't know if it actually ended up happening or not, because I didn't get any text messages tonight, but I'm being told that our show is right now being played at Anime Boston.
957596	960697	So if that's true, a big hello to you kids at Anime Boston.
961137	967359	And you know who sent me a text message, so I know for a fact you guys are listening in there, because I don't see anybody in chat or what have you.
967659	970099	But then again, my phone's in the house, so maybe that's what happened.
970399	972200	Well, if you've got mine, text me.
972580	973000	Yeah, there you go.
974046	974767	Game's Characters
999767	1002930	Alright, so you guys have to dig through your luggage and get your game ones.
1002990	1005932	Just gather a whole crap load of Guilty Gear cosplayers.
1005972	1007193	You'll be happy and done.
1007914	1010196	And remember, would Naruto count?
1010216	1014720	Because technically they have Naruto games, but Naruto is an anime character.
1015060	1016321	That's kind of a gray area.
1016341	1019844	In fact, a lot of anime characters are games in Japan, right?
1020825	1021526	I think it counts.
1022827	1023327	Next email.
1023607	1024448	Alright, yes, next email.
1025249	1026090	And this is from GS68.
1027352	1037014	Hey, OLR Crew, since DarkSakura, if I recall correctly, isn't going to Final May this year, will you still do a panel there?
1037034	1038794	It's one of the things I looked forward to last year.
1040775	1042495	If we are invited to, then yes.
1043515	1044256	I don't see why not.
1045656	1046256	Do we always submit?
1046276	1047396	I thought somebody submitted for us.
1047556	1048876	You always have to submit.
1048957	1050217	I submitted the last two years.
1050357	1051857	Are they accepting right now?
1052177	1052377	Yes.
1052937	1053918	I guess we have to submit then.
1054438	1054758	I don't know.
1054798	1055918	Loki, are we still going to do a panel?
1056570	1058791	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1085049	1087991	A bit about me, yes, I'm an actual DJ and I live in Las Vegas.
1088171	1089672	Arcades are still alive here.
1090192	1091933	I usually mix anime and video game music.
1091973	1093234	I DJ anime conventions.
1093254	1096276	I got my start as a DJ at FanimeCon 2002.
1097097	1097637	That's cool.
1098998	1101760	I'll be going to San Japan Con to meet with SmileDK.
1101840	1103040	I might faint when I meet them.
1103321	1103641	He he.
1104361	1111586	Other conventions I'll be attending are Anime Jam in Fresno, California and Anime Vegas Con in, wait, wait for it, Las Vegas, gasp.
1112561	1115463	So yes, I have a Wii, and I will be waiting for Mario Kart Wii.
1115643	1117984	I'm surprised that they removed snaking.
1118985	1122627	Oh well, I'll find another new strategy to overcome that muahaha.
1123408	1128691	I'm also surprised at how easy it is to find Brawl and still no Wii consoles to be found.
1129271	1130952	I haven't eaten at Olive Garden yet.
1131092	1133454	I want to have my first Olive Garden experience with OLR.
1133574	1134374	I can only dream.
1134835	1135915	Bye, DJ Junai.
1136035	1136416	P.S.
1136756	1138016	You pronounce my name right.
1138097	1140158	You win an internet and a Mudkip X3.
1141196	1144980	Ironically enough, I might actually be going to Vegas in a couple months, so it's on.
1145180	1146181	Olive Garden, like what?
1146822	1150366	There's a good Olive Garden in town, which I hope there's got to be in Las Vegas, right?
1151207	1152108	There's got to be.
1152228	1153209	There's got to be an Olive Garden.
1153269	1155972	No, there's no Olive Garden in Las Vegas.
1155992	1156732	That would suck.
1157213	1158254	Suck for Vegas.
1159475	1159996	Some like...
1160646	1163867	I seem to recall I was in the middle of BFE Pennsylvania and there was an Olive Garden there.
1163887	1166347	I wouldn't be surprised if there was the Olive Garden Casino in the works.
1166367	1169508	DJ Chenai is in chat and says, yes, there is an Olive Garden.
1169888	1173029	Mmm, if I get three breadsticks, does the machine spit out never-ending breadsticks?
1173069	1174669	And Sauce confirmed that there are a few.
1174910	1175290	Thank you.
1177570	1180991	And the reason I pronounced your name right is because I'm not Rob.
1183632	1183952	Shut up.
1184372	1185972	And Rosteel UT has a good point.
1186012	1188773	He says, why would you go to Vegas and then go to Olive Shit House?
1189878	1193419	You know where I want to... That's actually a good point, because Vegas has so many great restaurants.
1193459	1194599	Why the fuck would I go to Olive Garden?
1194619	1195719	I'll tell you where I would want to go.
1195859	1196079	Where?
1196259	1200540	I would want to go to the Rio and go to the seafood buffet.
1200560	1207942	The massive seafood buffet that I went to on the DDR Freak Moderator trip that ate a lot of my money.
1208622	1209922	I need to go back to Quark's Bar.
1210322	1211302	Get me a Warp Core Breach.
1211762	1212963	I can do one of those myself.
1213043	1214983	I am so going to Vegas in a couple months.
1215023	1215463	I can't wait.
1216643	1217224	I want to go.
1217544	1218104	My 30th birthday...
1219878	1221078	I still have to get you your present, you know.
1248640	1249921	Hey guys, let's have tea here.
1250682	1251843	Cool, I'd like some tea, thank you.
1252844	1259369	Wish I could be listening live tonight, but I'm on a plane right now flying home, so there's not really internet access on airplanes.
1261991	1265854	Anyhow, years back, Rob did a review on Trace Memory for the Nintendo DS.
1265914	1270318	Trace Memory is actually called Another Code outside the US for any international listeners.
1270778	1273020	And he went off on how amazing the game is.
1273567	1274067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1292800	1294621	But that rarely happened in Hotel Dusk.
1294701	1299265	The puzzles in Hotel Dusk are generally pretty neat and are excellent ways to use the touchscreen.
1299305	1304150	The game is so incredibly well written that it feels like you're actually interacting with the other people in the hotel.
1305230	1305651	Excuse me.
1306559	1311861	And for those of you who have no clue what Trace Memory is, it's a point-and-click adventure game that uses the DS hardware to the fullest.
1312361	1316923	The game is filled with all sorts of little puzzles that you have to solve, and most of them are very well thought out.
1317243	1327086	There's even one puzzle where you have to shut the DS just so that you can see the reflection from one side of the screen and the other in order to understand a riddle.
1327807	1329787	At any rate, check out both of these games.
1330307	1331068	Very good buys.
1332839	1335421	Take care, all, and please don't forget to save the podcast feed.
1335461	1337142	I'll need something to listen to on the flight back.
1337162	1338003	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1338043	1339403	We got it taken care of now.
1340584	1341285	You know what's funny?
1342105	1345127	I've never played Trace Memory, so I don't know how I reviewed it on the show.
1347729	1350711	I have a feeling it was Miklatov that played it.
1351291	1352772	I think it was Miklatov, not me.
1355874	1359937	I've been advised that you need to go to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.
1361098	1361798	Ooh, Margaritas.
1362019	1362559	I'm down with that.
1363018	1364599	Hey OLR, Sharon here.
1364679	1375247	I was going through some old episodes somewhere in the late 100s and noticed that Rob at one point brought up Feel the Magic and repeatedly griped about Sprung.
1392318	1393018	Thank you for watching!
1408261	1408661	and so on.
1429125	1434029	and Tsukihime or Clannad, two of which have been fairly popular anime based off of them.
1434510	1438013	I mean, FSN and Clannad, there was no Tsukihime anime.
1438273	1439094	Was that just fan art?
1440115	1446040	Actually, I did have one, and I actually heard of this one when the Sega CD was new, and it was called Takeru.
1447001	1447862	And it actually...
1450046	1457373	I'd remember seeing that they were going to bring it out in the U.S., but it never did on Sega CD, if I recall correctly.
1457433	1460235	However, I have a PC version of it that's fully translated.
1460956	1463859	I've definitely heard of Clannad before, but I haven't played it myself.
1463879	1464739	I've heard of the band.
1466881	1469023	Yeah, I hope I'm not getting it confused with the band.
1469063	1469864	No, I'm pretty sure I'm not.
1469884	1470324	I've heard of the game.
1470344	1471445	I think that's Enya's sister.
1472767	1473007	Anyway.
1475929	1476110	But...
1477319	1485665	There's a few of them that I've heard of, and they sort of did something like that one for the Silent Hill comics, too.
1485705	1487547	At least they tried to, but it didn't.
1487947	1491790	It was more just like, oh, we're going to have dramatic music with the comic book panels.
1492670	1494011	Okay, so that wasn't quite the same thing.
1494572	1495372	Anyway, moving forward.
1496113	1500116	Anyway, the next question involves an email you received last week that concerned the length
1500660	1503201	of arcade shooters like Gradius being too short.
1503581	1510464	I completely agree with Jamie that taking the time to get a high score or playthrough on one credit in games like these gives bragging rights.
1510984	1521768	This is doubly true of much more difficult games like Japanese Danmaku or bullet hell shooters like Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, or Mushihime-sama.
1523803	1525363	So this leads to my next question.
1525404	1530605	Have any of you ever played any games from the popular PC danmaku shooter series Touhou?
1531125	1535987	The Touhou game started on the PC-98 with a game called Highly Responsive to Prayers.
1536987	1547610	The game series features a perpetual protagonist named Reimu Hakurei, a miko who operates an unpopular and out-of-the-way shrine in the land called Gensokyo.
1549116	1556081	Toho's first appearance on Windows was the embodiment of Scarlet Devil, so if it catches your interest, I would recommend starting with that.
1556661	1563606	The games are very popular for their music, art style, and curtains, fire pattern, and sense of inner-game character development.
1564207	1575954	The games are available for free download on doujinstyle.com, and I would definitely advise anyone who still has fond memories of Radiant Silvergun to check the series out.
1576335	1578136	Keep up your exemplary work, Shaoran.
1579181	1583162	I have not played those games, but due to that well-worded free plug, I just might.
1584543	1596727	I've seen, I mean, I'm very, I'm familiar with Toho's games, but I mean, if it was PC, I hardly played it, so I was more of a, you know, like, I'd brought up Bangaio before.
1597008	1597988	That was one of my favorites.
1598028	1602970	I mean, it was more of a recent one, but I like those kind of games.
1603110	1606191	Actually, I really, really love Radiant Silvergun.
1607862	1609923	Alright, well then this sounds like something you ought to check out too.
1610023	1615824	Well, I was actually pretty thrilled that when, that had the aforementioned DDR Freak moderatorship.
1616264	1620746	We went to this place called, I want to say Game Land.
1622206	1623467	They've gone out of business since.
1623507	1628148	This was probably in 2000 something.
1628968	1629748	I don't really remember when.
1630489	1635210	But I found a Radiant Silvergun arcade machine and played the hell out of it.
1635774	1638215	Everyone's like, ooh, Mambo A Go-Go.
1638375	1639196	Let's go play that.
1639216	1640377	I mean, I'm like, fuck no.
1640837	1641397	I played that.
1641657	1643298	Mambo A Go-Go was kind of cool, though.
1643558	1643898	It is.
1644319	1648981	But I was too busy on Radiant Silver Gun and Biohazard Gun Survivor 2.
1649021	1650042	All right.
1652583	1653544	So that's it for the emails?
1654904	1655124	Yes.
1655565	1657065	Then you have to say no more emails.
1657426	1658126	No more emails!
1664582	1666243	She said you wanted some type of sound effects.
1666483	1667583	That was really tragic.
1667603	1668524	That's more humorous.
1669704	1670045	All right.
1670525	1675447	If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send them.
1675587	1678268	Meanwhile, we get back into the news, don't we, Loki?
1678829	1679489	Yes, we do.
1681330	1686672	So hopefully you haven't bought this already because if you did, you just wasted some money.
1686872	1692175	But Bungie is now going to be putting out the Halo...
1692905	1721274	3 Legendary Map Pack I believe it was previously $10 and included 3 maps out for free starting at 2am this Tuesday so that sucks but hey it's free and you know what though if you're still interested in spending some money on maps there are some more coming the next map pack which is going to include a Signed Winder remake
1721598	1722439	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1750595	1752196	Yeah, no, I only download them after they're free.
1752236	1753097	I don't need to pay for them.
1754198	1758501	Like, I don't know, I used to play Halo 2 with my college buddies a lot, but we really haven't been playing Halo 3.
1758761	1759362	It's kind of sad.
1759382	1759702	What was it?
1759722	1763845	They had a map that they released in the last map pack that I want to say was empty.
1764186	1767248	And it was just this big empty warehouse that you could build stuff with.
1767448	1767788	Nice.
1768409	1771992	And it's like, but you can build all these cool things and forge with it.
1772012	1774934	It's like, thanks, but you really didn't do anything.
1774954	1776996	You just made an empty warehouse, you idiot.
1777736	1778757	So, I don't know.
1780626	1781026	All right.
1781687	1783488	Well, you can check that out soon.
1783528	1791814	And one guy who might actually be back into checking this out was the really depressed guy who had his Xbox 360 ruined by Microsoft.
1791834	1792374	Do you remember this?
1793075	1795397	He had his personalized 360.
1795797	1799640	It was white clean when he did the whole Red Ring of Death fix.
1799720	1800180	Remember that?
1800320	1802242	They cleared it all away.
1802602	1805704	PR Nightmare, the story ended up on blogs everywhere.
1806044	1806985	Well, guess what?
1808203	1808743	Thanks for watching!
1834187	1836128	So he got more than he had before.
1836148	1840529	Yeah, he got like a care package from Bungie and also from Microsoft.
1840569	1841690	Way to kiss ass.
1844010	1847292	So this will probably be the last time you ever hear about this story on the blogs.
1847392	1851413	And now everyone everywhere is screaming, Microsoft, fuck up my 360.
1851793	1854474	I want a cool little care package like this.
1855134	1857695	Dude, the art's pretty cool on it.
1857715	1859176	Yeah, that's pretty rad.
1860056	1862297	Yo, watch this guy just turn around and sell it on eBay.
1862317	1863037	That would be tragic.
1864036	1864757	That'd be funny.
1867279	1869522	I want them to draw on my Xbox now.
1870943	1871224	Anyway.
1871524	1874527	They should have a service where you can send in your Xbox and get it drawn on.
1875368	1876269	I guess that is a little silly.
1876309	1878231	I would be happy to provide that service.
1878311	1882035	You pay me $200 and I will customize your Xbox 360 with a Sharpie.
1888030	1889350	Although I'm actually not joking.
1889650	1891331	Send me your faceplate and I'll customize it.
1891371	1892851	Actually, we should do that as a contest.
1892871	1894051	We should get a blank faceplate.
1894191	1895951	They have blank faceplates, right?
1896452	1897652	We can customize it somehow.
1897712	1899772	We've got some of the Ace Combat ones that we can paint over.
1900072	1900672	Okay, that'll work.
1900712	1906513	Well, you can just get a faceplate off of a core system or something and they're white.
1906954	1907894	Oh, there you go.
1907914	1910174	Or actually, all the original faceplates are white.
1910554	1911314	That might be fun.
1911994	1912455	Something to do.
1912655	1913515	I have some extra ones.
1914035	1914655	Alright, anyway.
1915683	1927928	Well, there's some information that's out now about Bionic Commando Rearmed, which is the 2D-style Bionic Commando that they're coming out with.
1929028	1937571	The title is supposed to be out in May, and it will be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade for $10 American.
1938472	1941473	And there will be a PC version, but they don't have a price on it yet.
1942168	1947749	But the Xbox Live version is going to actually be for 800 Microsoft points.
1948750	1950930	The PlayStation Network one is $10.
1953951	1959812	And that it will, for the PC version anyway, it will require Windows XP or Vista.
1960793	1961473	I'm so sorry.
1962813	1968015	At least 512 megabytes of RAM and 650 megabytes of hard drive space.
1969495	1969615	So.
1970290	1972911	and it may or may not have unique content.
1974932	1975992	It may or may not.
1976252	1976892	May or may not.
1976973	1979493	Well, thank you for covering the full spectrum of possibilities.
1979513	1980954	This game may or may not be good.
1981334	1982415	I have more information.
1983795	1988457	The minimum specs on this is XP Service Pack 2 or Vista.
1989297	1994359	Again, I have a pinning for 2 GHz or an AMD XP 2200.
1994399	1996580	512 MB of RAM, 650 MB of hard drive space.
2000785	2010192	128MB DirectX 9C compatible card or NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or ATI equivalent DirectX 9 compatible sound card, internet connection, keyboard, mouse.
2011053	2015296	Their recommended ones are actually quite a bit better, but, you know, honestly, why?
2019379	2019679	Okay.
2020459	2021040	I guess there's like...
2021673	2028337	You can download minimum content or you can have the maximum content that's saying you want two gigs of free hard drive space.
2028377	2031098	I think it's just the minimum requirements versus the maximum.
2031118	2039683	You can either install the entire game off the DVD or you could just run it off the DVD and some of it on the hard drive.
2040723	2041003	Whatever.
2043004	2044505	So it's kind of interesting, though.
2044525	2048948	There's been some stuff leaked out from the German ratings board, the USK,
2050280	2057947	Of course, they had leaked out some stuff a while back, including the translation of Catan and Kassaron to Xbox Live Arcade.
2058407	2061330	Well, now they have another board game turned Xbox Live Arcade.
2061350	2062291	Did you mean Carcassonne?
2062711	2063452	Carcassonne, whatever.
2064633	2065253	Casserole?
2065393	2066735	You said, like, casserole.
2067535	2068236	Carcassonne.
2069857	2070298	Whatever.
2070458	2071399	I had to, sorry.
2072099	2072460	Yeah.
2073280	2074121	Okay, you finished?
2074642	2075082	I'm done.
2075682	2076143	I promise.
2077003	2084449	Anyways, one of the games that they had on there was Ticket to Ride, which, if you've played it, it's a train-themed game.
2085289	2085970	Also pretty fun.
2086811	2100521	Some other games that they've also, you know, were revealed on there, of course, Penny Arcades games, On the Rain, Slick Precipice of Darkness, Rugu, and Golf, Tee It Up.
2102442	2105685	And at least, we don't know when they're coming, but at least they're on the way.
2106584	2107584	What are you giggling at?
2108985	2113046	TheRobD in chat says, I'm going to go play that Super Mario Goulash game next.
2114426	2114927	Whatever.
2116347	2117207	Chat room's funny.
2117267	2117988	I love chat room.
2118008	2120789	Chat.OrangeLawnRadio.com Yeah, chat's just perfect.
2121709	2122249	I love chat.
2124444	2128505	I also love more Xbox Live Arcade games as long as they don't suck.
2128585	2130005	But hey, it might be kind of cool.
2130765	2136567	Fable 2 is going to be interacting with apparently three different Xbox Live Arcade games.
2137107	2141648	Yeah, that was recently revealed this week in an interview with the guy behind Fable 2.
2142608	2147809	And money that is won in one of the games can actually be transferred to funds in Fable 2.
2147869	2148569	We already knew that.
2149089	2152790	But Carbonated Games has made apparently some casual games.
2153323	2154843	And there's three titles involved.
2154943	2159545	One is called Keystone, one is called Wizard's Tower, and the other one is called Mage Dice.
2159985	2167406	So when you play these games, which involve a little bit of gambling in them, you get Fable Gold in them, and you get to use that Fable Gold in your Fable game.
2167866	2169667	I'm just looking forward to co-op in this game.
2169687	2171587	You know you can't wait for co-op in Fable 2, Loki.
2171607	2176849	Yeah, the only bad thing about Wizard's Tower is it's really just Yaris renamed Wizard's Tower.
2177309	2177989	Shut up, really?
2178189	2178429	No.
2178669	2180409	Oh, I was going to say, that's horrible if so.
2180750	2182610	I wonder if these are going to be free.
2183564	2184124	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2209755	2216297	Well, duh, they're gonna, of course, have, you know, stuff like that, as well as, like, I don't know, Kill Your Dog, I don't know.
2217497	2223819	But at the same time, like, the original Fable sounded so freaking awesome, and then it was kinda... It was okay.
2224079	2224519	It was okay.
2226460	2228960	But I'm definitely interested in checking this game out, so we'll see.
2231741	2238503	Well, you know, there's another game that I think is... Well, okay, I never played it, but I know a lot of people did.
2238643	2239223	Puzzle Quest?
2240623	2254175	Well, Puzzle Quest was doing pretty well on Xbox Live Arcade, so there's actually going to be an expansion, and they're asking the players to name it for them.
2256537	2267406	If you actually go onto the contest website, which is at puzzle-quest.com Ooh, actually, it's already over.
2268550	2269250	It ended on the 21st.
2269270	2270510	Dang, that went by fast.
2270851	2273171	It wasn't even open when I last checked earlier this week.
2273491	2275192	It ended on the 21st.
2275212	2275792	Well, damn.
2276212	2279673	I was going to try to get our chatters to spam them with Puzzle Quest Orange or something.
2279793	2280973	No, not really.
2281313	2287455	Well, at any rate, they said that once they've decided the name, then the expansion's going to be out in the spring over Xbox Live.
2288035	2289575	So, have fun.
2289715	2292056	But what about all the other places they hoard Puzzle Quest to?
2292096	2293076	They just get shafted, huh?
2293633	2294253	I have no idea.
2294453	2301737	I would have never thought Puzzle Quest was going to get an expansion or any type of microtransactions whatsoever because of the fact it was on the DS and all these other systems.
2302157	2304158	So I'm kind of surprised at this news.
2305518	2307839	So it's just interesting.
2308440	2309380	I don't know how else to explain it.
2309500	2309900	Interesting.
2310301	2310981	I wasn't expecting that.
2311001	2312161	Were you expecting an expansion?
2312181	2312642	I sure wasn't.
2312662	2313302	An expansion?
2314062	2317704	No, because I thought they would just hoard that out in Puzzle Quest 2 or something like that.
2318444	2322406	But, you know, I guess something to kill time until Puzzle Quest Galactics comes out.
2323436	2325178	Galactrix or whatever the fuck they're calling it.
2327199	2328780	The I Can't Believe It's Not Puzzle Quest?
2328981	2329341	Yes.
2329881	2330222	Gotcha.
2330462	2343393	Alright, so this weekend there's been a whole bunch of drama revolving a supposedly leaked game, Sonic Unleashed, with tons of screenshots out there available for it.
2343793	2346955	People are wondering, is this an actual game that got leaked?
2347056	2348737	Is this an April Fool's joke?
2349423	2349963	Who knows?
2350163	2354385	Well, first, you know, it started off, eh, it's probably fake, you know, who knows?
2354825	2359667	But then there's like a hundred-some screenshots for this, so I don't know.
2359707	2362548	If it is fake, it's one of the most elaborate fakes I've ever seen.
2363469	2374733	But then apparently now, there was news that, you know, Sega of Europe said that it is official and that they were going to be announcing it during their May Gamers Day event.
2375702	2388594	and also make an official announcement at E3 but then there are some sort of wishy-washy stuff going on with that and now it's maybe not real again.
2389094	2395560	I think at this point it's safe to say with the video out there, with the screenshots out there, I would say it's real.
2395800	2402286	I don't see how it can be a fake at this point based off that video because that video is pretty kick-ass which is out there on YouTube somewhere, right?
2402813	2403133	Sonic 2.5D
2426071	2432676	and also that there's going to be some stuff run in the official Nintendo magazine, the UK one.
2433597	2437400	That's going to be, I guess, the cover in August for them.
2437901	2447628	So right now we're speculating that it's coming out for the 360 and probably a version for the Wii and you can probably assume that there's a version for the PS3 if there's one coming out for the 360, so...
2449250	2452411	Actdeft in chat says, hope for Sonic's future equals rising.
2452571	2453451	I really hope so.
2453891	2460253	Because the last few Sonic, you know, in creations in a row, you know, minus his appearance in Brawl, have all been very disappointing.
2460693	2462213	So, God, I hope so.
2462993	2463434	I really hope.
2463454	2464254	Don't you hope, Jamie?
2464414	2465554	I hope they got it right, finally.
2466214	2466774	I can hope.
2466974	2468395	The screenshots are pretty awesome.
2468455	2469855	I mean... I watched the movie file.
2469895	2470955	It looked pretty sweet.
2471376	2476637	I think... Like I said, you know, if it was a hoax, I mean...
2477475	2479976	Then the hoax game needs to come out, honestly.
2480036	2487240	That is one hell of an elaborate hoax to fake, I don't know how many screenshots of this game.
2487661	2488921	Or even a mapped level.
2490062	2492983	The video followed the level all the way through.
2493684	2497966	It's very unlikely that it would be an April Fool's joke.
2498006	2498747	But hey, you know what?
2498827	2500648	Credit to them if it is an April Fool's joke.
2500668	2502048	Because you fooled us.
2502428	2505150	That was one of the most convincing April Fool's jokes I've ever seen.
2505970	2506650	April Fool's Joke
2532971	2534672	And some of our listeners may not even know this.
2534692	2536133	You may have just saw the news earlier this week.
2536153	2537634	But yes, it came out.
2537674	2543297	GoNintendo ran a report with a video from the guy who actually created the whole thing.
2543317	2544497	And he kind of shows how he did it.
2544798	2547359	It was actually meant to be an April Fool's joke.
2547699	2553542	And apparently what happened is that he posted the joke in IRC trying to get some feedback from some of the folks in IRC.
2553562	2554523	Like, hey, is this believable?
2554863	2559665	Well, some of the folks in IRC sent it to Joystick and it got out there a little bit early.
2559866	2560306	Whoops.
2561300	2563502	So, unfortunately, it is fake.
2563542	2565504	Wario's Woods not coming to WiiWare.
2566024	2570168	At least this one, I mean, but then again, you never know what Nintendo might have up their sleeve.
2570889	2579396	It may not look like this, but as far as I'm concerned, whatever artists did these did a pretty darn good job, and Nintendo maybe ought to think to talking to this guy.
2580017	2581578	Maybe they ought to cook something like this up.
2582319	2582839	So we'll see.
2584181	2587824	But sadly, no Wario's Woods on WiiWare anytime soon.
2589850	2591711	Unless Nintendo's getting the last laugh, who knows?
2593133	2610125	Well, something that came out in the April issue of UK's official Xbox magazine said that Ikaruga was out now and was getting a 9 out of 10 from the magazine with no actual release date.
2610966	2615309	So, you know what?
2617031	2617471	Is this real?
2619484	2620325	April Fool's Joke
2637560	2640862	Because it's the April issue, so this hasn't... Well, the game is coming.
2640902	2642504	We've had a story on this before.
2642524	2643364	The game is coming.
2643404	2643905	That's not No Fools.
2643925	2649068	Just for a moment, when you were talking about April Fool's, I was like, wait, they better not be taunting me with Ikaruga.
2649169	2650490	God, I hate April Fool's Day.
2650730	2651290	I know.
2651310	2653432	I mean, seriously, it's going to be like this for the next two weeks.
2653452	2655813	Well, they did have it out at the Tokyo Game Show.
2655894	2657975	I just wasn't thinking that it was out quite yet.
2658375	2665000	But Ikaruga is like one of the best, best shooter games ever, so that's really cool.
2665400	2665981	And it's Treasure...
2666904	2671427	GS68 in chat says, game publications should be banned from making April issues anymore.
2671487	2672208	I kind of agree.
2673708	2674329	I kind of agree.
2674389	2675009	Maybe it's just me.
2675309	2688257	Well, if I were a game publication, I would just flat up post a little editorial in my magazine saying, while certain other magazines and publications may want to...
2689700	2691481	Joke about April Fools and stuff like that.
2691581	2700566	I would just say we don't do that and we figure that you would appreciate more accurate coverage than something that may confuse you.
2700606	2700926	I don't know.
2702667	2707550	Which is I think the kind of stance we take on this show.
2707630	2709090	Usually our jokes are pretty obvious.
2709651	2713092	And I don't think we're going to do one this year now in light of the other news that came out.
2713173	2713813	So we'll see.
2714173	2715574	The joke is we're going to stay on Live 365.
2722226	2724327	So, moving on with more news then, Loki.
2724788	2737436	Well, we don't like to talk about him too much, but there was a brand new story this week about our friend Jackie Poo, or Voldemort, as you may know him.
2738237	2747523	The Florida Supreme Court has sent an official notice to Jack Thompson that he now must have...
2748669	2753371	An attorney to basically approve any further cases he has.
2754672	2767918	The court's ruling is basically saying that the numerous abuses that Thompson had made, including submitting pornography and stuff like that, is a relentless and frivolous pursuit for vindication of his claim that he is being victimized by the Florida Bar.
2768399	2777263	And the continued ability to maintain the minimum standard of decorum and respect for the judicial system in which the litigants and especially the attorneys must adhere.
2777813	2793504	Because of this, basically, the motion has been made that for any lawsuit that he is now putting forward, it must be signed off by, I guess, an accredited attorney or something like that.
2793524	2794825	In other words, he needs a babysitter.
2795106	2795346	Yes.
2799108	2800169	It's interesting.
2800249	2800630	I don't know.
2801810	2806774	Hopefully we'll see a lot less of him unless he gets some other retarded person to kind of help him along.
2807250	2808651	I think it's about damn time.
2808671	2812934	That's wonderful.
2833275	2854031	and here's the best part about the whole thing after this ruling came down apparently Thompson sent out an email describing the Supreme Court's order as both good news and idiotic yeah, because he's got them right where he wants them now does he live on another planet?
2854191	2860616	I don't know speaking of crazy stuff
2861684	2867345	There's that new Street Fighter movie coming out, Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li, and it's getting a more full cast.
2867365	2868726	You know, Chris Klein is in it.
2869066	2871827	He plays Guile's friend, which apparently is a big role.
2871907	2872207	I don't know.
2872767	2874007	Charlie.
2874087	2874727	Right, Charlie Nash.
2876048	2879008	Kristen Crook, who is the Lana Lane, right?
2879188	2882149	Or Lois Lane?
2882829	2883129	One of them.
2883830	2885530	She's Lois Lane on Smallville.
2886470	2889331	She's playing, no, I guess it would be Lana Lane because it was a daughter, right?
2890123	2890423	I don't know.
2890443	2891384	I don't watch them all.
2891884	2892345	Whatever.
2892425	2893425	She's going to be Chun-Li.
2894366	2896848	I bet half the guys who watch her don't even know what her name is.
2896868	2897568	They just watch her.
2897868	2901451	She's going to be Chun-Li and Michael Clark Duncan is going to be Balrog.
2902291	2902832	Get this.
2903532	2906214	Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas is going to be Vega.
2907375	2909437	He's the guy with the long hair and the black eyed piece.
2909477	2910338	He's going to be Vega.
2910378	2911619	That's going to be interesting.
2912740	2915842	Neil McDonough is going to be M. Bison.
2916343	2921507	And I've never really heard that name, but then when I see his picture, I'm like, okay, that guy.
2921647	2923929	I think I've seen him before somewhere.
2924990	2930135	And I agree with SSJ100 Matt in chat who says, this movie fails for one reason, no Kylie.
2930475	2931316	And I kind of agree.
2932917	2935199	Oh, this guy was in Star Trek First Contact.
2935896	2936637	That's why it looks familiar.
2936717	2939120	Minority Report, Band of Brothers.
2940020	2941702	Okay, he's been a handful of films.
2941722	2943224	You know why this movie also fails?
2943364	2943925	Uh-oh, why?
2944325	2955918	Because it's a Street Fighter movie, and anybody that thinks of Street Fighter the movie is always going to think of the last horrible Street Fighter movie that killed...
2958611	2963714	I just realized why this guy looks so familiar to me, but I almost don't want to say why.
2963854	2966116	And it's because of one of the movies he was recently in.
2967077	2969398	It was the last movie I saw on DVD.
2972180	2973541	It was I Know Who Killed Me.
2974822	2976663	I actually watched that on DVD.
2976703	2977844	Why did you watch that?
2978124	2985329	Because I have to see... Okay, when a film wins the award for worst movie of the year, I have to see just how bad it is.
2985789	2987090	No, you don't.
2987642	2991905	They give you fair warning that it sucks, so why do you need to... I like bad movies.
2991925	2992965	Like, I love Showgirls.
2993386	2997568	Showgirls is one of my favorite movies of all time, but it's one of those things where it's so bad, it's good.
2997748	2998109	Get it?
2998589	3004753	Like, we actually had a discussion about this at our friend's house the other day, and the movie actually came up as Caveman.
3006394	3007054	Have you seen that movie?
3007254	3007554	No.
3008135	3013378	It was really, really not a good movie, and it was one of the 70s, and like, the dinosaurs in it were all claymation.
3014079	3014299	Nice.
3014339	3016200	But it was so awful that it's a great movie.
3018191	3018471	Nice.
3019851	3021472	I've seen Teenage Caveman.
3021572	3023312	That was like Mystery Science Seeker 3000.
3025313	3026573	Manos, The Hands of Fate.
3028774	3030174	Alright, can we please move on?
3030994	3031574	Yeah.
3032855	3033915	I have some stuff.
3035175	3039596	So, um, I don't know how I feel about this.
3039876	3047238	Because, you know, again, with all of the movies coming out from, you know, video games, and especially since the, uh,
3048892	3052713	The horrible, horrible UiBull is associated with this one.
3053633	3061655	The Name of the King, A Dungeon Siege Tale is going to be out on April 15th.
3062275	3068097	You know, I knew this like a long time ago and I wish I had thought about this, but I figured it was an UiBull movie and no one really cares.
3069237	3075679	It will have deleted scenes, behind the scenes featurette, and trailers.
3076919	3077459	And, um,
3078573	3087798	The suggested retail is $27.98, so look for it in the $5 bin at Walmart in a few weeks after that.
3087818	3091439	I don't know if anyone else saw the news this week.
3092020	3100104	They're running a website for Postal the movie, because it's launching the same weekend as...
3102205	3130235	Indiana Jones and they have Vern Troyer dressed up like Indy and it was like I don't remember what the phrase was it was something stupid like I have a message for Indy fuck you or fuck you up or something like that I don't know I'm sure it's supposed to be parody but half of me still thinks that they literally think that they're going to beat Indiana Jones in the box office
3132094	3132494	Somehow.
3132574	3133894	Delusional.
3134594	3135175	Exactly.
3137195	3140516	You know what's going to happen when they go back to work Monday morning after that weekend?
3142876	3144796	Vern Troyer's going to go drink some more?
3150517	3153458	No, he's about as delusional as Jack Thompson.
3153538	3158779	It's basically just going to be, you know, he's going to think it's a great victory for him and that, you know,
3159232	3162955	It may make him the most money out of any of his movies or some shit like that.
3164256	3167279	He'll have renewed hope for making more video game movies or something.
3167399	3167719	I don't know.
3167879	3169741	I kind of miss when this show had a soundboard.
3169781	3172943	I think in our post-Life 365 era, we need to bring back the soundboard.
3172963	3175585	I kind of miss having one.
3175906	3177087	Yeah.
3177707	3178448	Okay.
3178488	3178768	Sorry.
3181447	3184449	Call of Duty 4 is a very successful game.
3185069	3190233	They are going to be getting a brand new Game of the Year edition, which is going to be coming out in April.
3190433	3195817	Actually, April 3rd for the Xbox 360 version.
3196598	3205604	Along with that, there will be a brand new map pack that's going to have a few different maps of Creek, Broadcast, Chinatown, and Killhouse.
3205964	3207205	That's going to be available for $10.00.
3208682	3213826	And as you might guess, in the Game of the Year edition, you get a token to download that for free.
3213966	3218369	So if you haven't bought the game yet and are thinking about it, you may wait for this one to come out.
3218930	3228197	It should be noted, though, that for some reason whatsoever, the PlayStation 3 version is coming out a few weeks after the Xbox 360 one.
3229257	3231979	I don't get that, but that's what's going on.
3234241	3234881	Hooray.
3237904	3238264	Hooray.
3239466	3241707	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3261957	3262817	They actually have the game.
3262837	3266478	Like, I can see this little picture of the games actually kind of hanging around the collar of the shirt.
3266858	3268238	So you can get both for $12.
3268298	3269518	That's cool.
3269638	3270879	That's kind of a neat little concept.
3270899	3271599	That is really cool.
3271879	3274799	That is strange to see at Target, though, of all places.
3274839	3277240	Like, I would not have expected this to be at Target.
3278800	3280560	EGP Apparel.
3280580	3283261	I would expect to see that maybe at, like, GameStop or something.
3283341	3286282	Yeah, or, you know, some other type of nerd store, like Hot Topic.
3286322	3287302	It's kind of nerdy, right?
3287322	3288882	I don't know.
3289455	3292776	EGP Apparel.com if you want to see more about that.
3293096	3294616	Buy the shirt and get the game for free.
3295497	3296137	That's cool.
3296157	3297077	That's very interesting.
3297277	3298397	Tower of Goo sounds funny.
3298538	3300698	Macman in chat says Target and Kmart.
3301198	3302839	Tower of Goo is coming to WiiWare also.
3304779	3305719	You know what I didn't realize?
3305880	3311621	I did not realize until like just last week that Destroy or Defend Your Castle game that's coming to the Wii.
3312261	3318203	I did not realize that it's based off the old Flash game where you throw the guys up in the air and watch them explode into millions of pieces.
3318283	3318443	Yes.
3319096	3320096	XGenStudios.com slash play slash castle
3350131	3352733	That game is so much fun, even though it's like years old.
3352793	3354494	I think it's been on the internet for like three years.
3355195	3359198	Let me post that in chat there so our lovely chatters can take a look at that game.
3359218	3362400	But don't get too distracted because it's time for us to open up the Skype line.
3362440	3365462	That's right, it's the part of the show where we let you guys interact with us.
3365502	3371627	If you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3371667	3375029	This is the part of the show where you can do that and interact with us.
3375149	3377531	We'll be taking calls, I'd say, right about right now.
3379534	3380395	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3408635	3409295	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3427699	3431100	A different homebrew kind of hack thing that they had going on.
3431220	3434721	I told you it would take like 15 seconds for Nintendo to patch that shit.
3434741	3436521	No, it's not the one you're thinking, too.
3436621	3438641	It's this thing called a Trecha Signer.
3439062	3450924	It basically allows them to create, because all the files on Wii discs are encrypted, so this will allow you to create the key and basically put your own files, make your own homebrew discs for the Wii, basically.
3450944	3451784	All right, let's go to the phones.
3451824	3452665	I got somebody on hold.
3452925	3453905	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3453925	3454245	Who's this?
3455427	3456468	Yeah, what's up?
3456488	3457449	This is Ross DLUT.
3457529	3457829	Hello.
3457869	3459850	Wow, you're really good at getting through first.
3459870	3461171	You're like the new Raven's Dolphin.
3461211	3462612	Whatever happened to Raven's Dolphin?
3463933	3465274	Did he abandon our show?
3466475	3468897	Raven's Dolphin, where are you?
3469237	3470118	I miss you.
3470298	3470818	Okay, I'm sorry.
3470858	3472019	Ross DLUT, you're cool too.
3472039	3472339	What's up?
3473120	3482287	Okay, first off, I'm surprised you didn't mention this early on in the show when you were talking about the Gibson lawsuit bonanza.
3482387	3482507	But...
3484485	3487106	But here's a link that talks about the patent.
3487146	3488387	I'm going to put it in the chat right now.
3491248	3511456	Basically, what's happening is that the diagram that goes with the patent shows a stereoscopic headset, an 8-channel mixer, effects processor, among other crazy-ass shit, and an actual musical instrument.
3512631	3514953	I don't know if you can see the picture from that link.
3515053	3516114	Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
3516814	3521658	Yeah, I didn't want to spend too much time on that whole Gibson lawsuit because I think it's retarded.
3521718	3524099	I was going to get to that actually in a few seconds.
3524119	3524980	What do you want to say then, Loki?
3525541	3528843	Well, basically, here's what Harmonix's response to the Gibson lawsuit was.
3528883	3533606	This lawsuit is completely without merit and we intend to defend it vigorously.
3534487	3540952	Gibson's patent filed nearly 10 years ago required a 3D display, a real musical instrument, and a recording of a concert.
3541654	3544175	Rock Band and Guitar Hero are completely different.
3544295	3550276	Among other things, they are games, require no headset, and use a controller only shaped like a real instrument.
3550336	3557117	It's unfortunate that Gibson unfairly desires to share the tremendous success enjoyed by the developers of Rock Band and Guitar Hero.
3557858	3562239	Yeah, looking at this little picture of the guitar, I mean, I know pictures and patents aren't supposed to be the end-all, be-all.
3562259	3563319	It looks like a MIDI guitar.
3563339	3567660	We've seen others throughout the years, but this looks nothing like the game controller that they're using.
3567680	3567940	Yeah.
3569595	3577442	Yeah, I mean, it looks so far removed from Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
3577783	3579664	I don't even see where Gibson's coming from.
3579744	3583548	They're not going to win this, that's for sure.
3584849	3586090	It's not even close.
3587211	3588332	Not even, not even.
3589012	3590834	And I'm shocked seeing it that they'd even bother.
3591775	3594277	But then again, we've seen more stupid lawsuits before.
3595218	3596279	You know, um...
3597651	3599071	Oh yes, there was one other thing.
3599771	3610533	Rainbow Six Vegas 2 came out last week, and if anybody's listening and is thinking about getting it, I would stay away from the PS3 one if you're interested in online, because the online is broken.
3611854	3613454	Oh great, what's broken about it?
3615034	3625656	Well, I'm finding myself unable to get into most games, and the few games that I can get into...
3626728	3629110	I get booted off right away, and it's not just me.
3629250	3632492	In those few games, I've talked to the people there, and they're having the same problem.
3633232	3636274	I know it's not me, because I'm not having the problem with Vegas 1.
3636494	3641917	I'm not having a problem with a lot of the other PS3 games, Call of Duty 4 and stuff like that.
3641957	3645740	I was actually rather shocked, especially since the game had a release day patch.
3649642	3651083	Don't worry, a patch will fix it.
3652304	3655866	That seems to be the thinking of video games in this day and age.
3656806	3657106	What's that?
3658168	3660851	Like the patch that came out when the game came out?
3661051	3661572	I'm serious.
3661873	3662954	I pre-ordered the game.
3662994	3663955	I got it first day, right?
3665377	3666478	And I go home.
3667580	3671004	Literally, immediately, PlayStation Network's like, yeah, we got a patch.
3671325	3671725	Download it.
3671845	3672386	I was like, all right.
3673694	3676014	I forget it was a multiplayer patch, but apparently not.
3676335	3679915	Patches should be for like what Rock Band just did.
3680075	3687256	It added a whole new feature to the thing that maybe should have been there in the first place, but oh well, it was a new feature, something new and neat.
3687336	3689237	Like, that is an acceptable patch to me.
3689777	3692477	An unacceptable patch to me is, oh, I don't know, Bully?
3694578	3695758	Or countless others?
3696138	3697458	Yeah, that's another one.
3697518	3700899	Another thing is, this isn't the first time we've seen an
3702037	3707943	Ubisoft game with a patch to fix things that were either broken or they were too lazy to get in.
3707963	3711487	I don't know if you guys remember Naruto Rise of a Ninja?
3713169	3716433	Like a week after the game came out, they came out with a Japanese language patch.
3716953	3718255	It is literally 52 megs.
3719476	3721838	You know, they're basically unlocking it off the disc.
3721898	3722960	I mean, it's just ridiculous.
3723861	3724241	I don't know.
3725427	3727548	I don't know, 52 megs doesn't sound like a key.
3727688	3729048	Usually a key's pretty small.
3729528	3733330	52 megs, that sounds like actual dialogue to me.
3733790	3734990	There's no possible way.
3735250	3740392	It's all the voices in the town and the cutscenes.
3740652	3743213	There's a lot more than 52 megs worth of dialogue going on there.
3743233	3743893	It's all voices.
3749455	3751096	I don't see how that could be all the dialogue.
3751136	3752356	It's just too much.
3753917	3754317	You know...
3755311	3783629	either way, we don't see it as much as we did when the 360 came out I think companies are getting better about it but we're still seeing this sort of ah, suck it, rush it out, we'll patch it attitude and it's going to start hurting companies especially with these consoles getting more popular because you know the majority of them aren't going to be online it's just a numbers game
3787016	3793738	and I really feel sorry for the people who are going to get stuck with unpatched versions, especially with what Rob mentioned, Bully.
3795358	3796219	That's going to suck.
3797219	3801441	Well, Ross, to you too, we've got to wrap up so you can go, but any other quick thoughts you want to get out there?
3804782	3806662	Actually, no.
3806742	3809823	I mean, that's pretty much it.
3809863	3811404	Well, except for the whole
3812074	3840429	Ubisoft buying Tom Clancy thing the only thing I was surprised was that they hadn't already done it yeah that's kind of I would have thought that was already a relationship that was but there you have it alright Ross have a good one buddy you do the same bye bye alright if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio any other stories you want to share with us Loki while we're waiting sure
3840911	3843372	There's apparently some pretty cool mods.
3843792	3844853	Oh, never mind, we got a call.
3845353	3847094	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?
3849415	3849915	Hey, what's up?
3849975	3850776	It's the Rob D, guys.
3850836	3853057	Well, hello, long time no talk, Rob D, how are you?
3855558	3858159	Yeah, yeah, I've kind of been working and all that fun stuff.
3858179	3862081	I work most Sundays and I close, so that kind of disables me from actually listening to you guys.
3862301	3862721	Work?
3863521	3865582	What is this work thing you speak of?
3868123	3868944	Yeah, I know, uh,
3869978	3872660	I need to actually abandon my job and only play games for a living.
3872960	3873460	Exactly.
3873480	3874661	See how that one goes for a little while.
3874981	3875381	Exactly.
3875401	3876722	All right, well, what's on your mind tonight, Rob?
3878623	3894132	Well, I've got to say, actually, just listening to RawSteelUT's call, now that Ubisoft actually owns a Tom Clancy, we're going to see Tom Clancy's, I don't know, Tom Clancy's Naughty Toad, Rise of a Ninja, or Tom Clancy's Enchanted Arms now that they actually own the property.
3895093	3897234	I somehow doubt that would happen, but...
3898960	3927154	usually that's kind of like the same thing with the whole when Activision bought Blizzard or whatever the whole World of Warcraft will come to Guitar Hero tomorrow that'd be great but I gotta say the reason I called in is I don't really have a topic to discuss but I need to just express my joy as a fighting game fan of just the titles coming out this year because you've got King of Fighters 12 you've got Super Smash Brothers Brawl Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, Soul Calibur 4
3928574	3930116	I can't remember a crop of fighting games.
3930356	3931077	Tekken 6?
3931537	3933559	At the very least, with this pedigree.
3933659	3934220	Yeah, exactly.
3934240	3936142	With this pedigree for a very long time.
3936162	3938244	We'll see if all these games end up panning out to be good.
3938924	3940686	That obviously remains to be seen.
3941887	3948654	As a fighting game fan, I just haven't been this excited for games, especially to see some of these franchises go online multiplayer for the very first time.
3948674	3948934	Hopefully...
3951345	3952006	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3976269	3977170	That's kind of interesting.
3977190	3982935	And I was just looking at some screenshots for the other day for King of Fighters 12, and it looks pretty hot, I gotta say.
3983095	3988120	Yeah, they redrew all the animations for all that, so I'm looking forward to seeing how they'll actually turn out.
3988760	3996107	Trucker Terry is back, so for all the Terry Bogard, Ingrish, Hey Come On Come On fans, that should make many of them pleased.
3996127	3996227	Nice.
3996828	3997048	Nice.
3997358	4003919	Speaking of old school fighting games from SNK, you know how your pick, your classic game of the week last week was The Last Blade.
4004279	4010161	I actually went, they have it on GameTap 1 and 2, so I went and played it for a little bit, just because I had never really played it before.
4010221	4010601	It's fun.
4011321	4014922	Although I was using a keyboard, and fighting games with keyboards are always kind of wonky.
4014942	4018062	You've got to really use a joystick, but I had fun while I was playing.
4018362	4020223	I think it's a really stylish game.
4020843	4022343	Yeah, it's definitely stylish.
4022363	4023864	I couldn't figure out any of the fatalities, though.
4023884	4025904	That was the part I was looking forward to doing, but
4026465	4031308	Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to derail, but what do you think about the whole Street Fighter 4?
4031348	4037773	Do you think it's shaping up to be pretty awesome, or is it just like Street Fighter 2 10 years later, or what do you think?
4039574	4052863	Well, it's nice to see that they're actually modernizing the look, and I think this is an important step for the franchise, that they're moving finally from sprites to some modern graphics that aren't done by, what was that company that did Street Fighter EX?
4053343	4055164	I think Akira or something like that?
4055184	4056225	I don't even remember, frankly.
4058273	4083882	to me it all depends on how the game plays you can't really determine until the game actually comes out I think it's going to be disappointing if the game doesn't really come out with anything particularly new in the fighting game engine especially since SNK has been changing up their fighting game engine practically every year and with King of Fighters 11 they really pulled out all the stops with the super cancels well not the super cancels because that's been there for a while but the dream cancels the saving shifts um
4086206	4091527	A lot of things that actually changed the gameplay and just really helped it out as a franchise.
4093267	4095268	I'd really like to see how the game plays.
4095608	4102109	Considering I really doubt that it'll actually make any kind of a splash in American arcades, we'll probably have to wait until it comes out whenever it does.
4103089	4105349	Do you think American arcades can be saved, Rob?
4108710	4109250	Probably not.
4109350	4113631	Not with how online play has just proliferated over here.
4114775	4121516	In Japan, I don't think that's really as much of a concern since they're not really into shooters as much as we are, certainly.
4122516	4126517	They haven't had Xbox Live, or at least they don't support Xbox Live as much as we do.
4126837	4133398	I really doubt you can get gamers that gathered again out of their homes.
4134238	4142940	You can count how long ago it was when arcades were still like, they might have been getting closer on its last legs, but this show started due to hanging out in an arcade, so
4143404	4144265	This is kind of sad.
4145926	4151131	I have fond memories of playing Neo Geo games and playing, you know, the old X-Men arcade game, Turtles in Time, especially.
4151191	4151931	Oh, hell yeah.
4151991	4152372	Oh, God.
4152392	4154774	You can still play Neo Geo arcade.
4154794	4157396	Like, they have a Neo Geo arcade machine at Jim Boy's Tacos.
4157756	4158477	Have you seen that?
4158817	4159658	I don't eat at Jim Boy's.
4159978	4162420	Oh, but, well, okay, well, they have one there.
4162440	4163381	It might be worth looking at.
4164462	4166203	There's a bajillion Jim Boys around, too.
4166464	4166744	Yeah.
4167144	4168045	I don't know which one you mean.
4168145	4169186	It's the one over on...
4169605	4170526	Folsom and Sunrise.
4170726	4171066	Okay.
4171126	4173728	Yeah, I know that makes no sense to our other listeners, but anyway.
4173748	4182434	Well, I used to go to Rico's Pizza and play the DDR there while I was eating pizza and 18 Wheeler Pro Trucker.
4183294	4187617	Yeah, remember when pizza parlors had hella arcade games in them?
4188077	4193301	Like, it was like pizza slash arcade and now, like, you're lucky to go to a round table and see, like, two games and a pinball table.
4193341	4193741	That's it.
4193901	4194702	You're lucky to see that.
4194742	4197804	Well, we were just talking about, just for the pinball aspect, we were talking, because...
4198237	4198517	Crane Games
4224537	4225057	That's sad.
4225177	4234080	Yeah, the Pizza Parlor was where I first played Street Fighter 2, so... And actually, the first character I ever played as was Dhalsim, or as my mom called him, Mr. Stretchy Arms.
4234520	4240022	So I've always kind of had a soft spot in my heart for Pizza Parlor arcade games.
4240282	4242643	My first Street Fighter 2 was at a 7-Eleven.
4243583	4245764	My first Street Fighter 2 was at a college arcade.
4247584	4251385	My college arcade... I can still remember the lineup for the longest time.
4252046	4252466	We had...
4254329	4257190	Cyber, not, what am I thinking of?
4257410	4258810	I can't remember, Cyberstorm was it?
4258950	4263232	It was sort of like a virtual on ripoff, sort of.
4264252	4270394	And we had Killer Instinct, we had World Cup Soccer 94, which became my favorite table and I own one now.
4272335	4280017	We had Dark Stalkers, we had KOF 94, and a bunch of other machines that I usually ignored.
4281517	4307281	SSJ100 Matt says yeah I remember when 7-Elevens had arcade games here and I was going to say it wasn't a 7-Eleven but the same type of thing a little convenience store chain was one of the first places I played Mortal Kombat 2 good times 7-Eleven actually went out of business in Alabama a long time ago I was really surprised when I moved out here and saw 7-Elevens but I would go to any one of them and there would always be some sort of game whether it worked or not was another story but there would be a game there
4308356	4309117	So it was weird.
4309337	4311499	Now you can find good arcade machines, though, at TrekStops.
4312800	4314341	I found Derby Owner's Club at TrekStops.
4315162	4315742	Good times.
4315902	4319946	All right, well, Rob D., we've been on the phone a while now, so I've got to ask you so we can get some more calls.
4319986	4320767	Any last thoughts?
4320827	4321727	Any other things you want to say?
4324009	4325591	Uh... How I dunk!
4326031	4326852	I'll just end it there.
4327152	4328133	All right, have a good one, Rob.
4328153	4328733	See you guys later.
4328914	4329174	Bye.
4330535	4332216	I guess he was getting some bad echo on the line.
4332236	4333197	I don't know how that happened.
4333277	4334278	Happened, happened, happened.
4334338	4334779	No, just kidding.
4335219	4335699	All right, uh...
4336872	4338052	You can give us a call if you want.
4338072	4339773	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4339873	4341593	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4341633	4343473	Loki, what was that story you were going to read for us earlier?
4345134	4354755	Well, apparently there's some really cool mods, character mods you can have for the PlayStation 3 version, or actually the PC version also of Unreal Tournament 3, including Master Chief.
4355615	4357976	They also have the guy from Crysis.
4358656	4363617	There's also some, of course, Marcus Fenix and Cloud...
4364429	4365030	and Spawn.
4365410	4370735	And actually, the one for Halo, I gotta say, looks better than the Xbox 360 version.
4372476	4373277	Let's go to the phones.
4373317	4374278	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4374298	4374638	Who's this?
4375599	4376840	Oh, sweet Jesus, I finally got in.
4376860	4378101	It's DJ Dark Knight.
4378182	4379122	Hi, DJ Dark Knight.
4379142	4379723	What's on your mind?
4380904	4381384	Not much.
4381785	4385108	I was surprised y'all guys didn't talk about Guitar Hero DS.
4386129	4387150	We did.
4387210	4388611	You might have arrived late to the show.
4388631	4389612	It was early in Part A.
4390751	4398817	Well, I remember I saw a peripheral about it, and all I could think of is, ugh, major cramps for that game, I swear.
4399117	4399817	I don't think so.
4400878	4401678	I don't know.
4402359	4409304	Because it's going to be just like you're holding the guitar, usually, but I think it would be very comfortable, actually, because the keys are sideways.
4409764	4410865	It's not like on top.
4410905	4416849	That would cramp your hands, but your hand actually slides through like a little Velcro holder thing.
4416869	4417389	I don't know.
4417409	4419130	It still looks like a carpal tunnel nightmare to me.
4419150	4419751	I don't know.
4419771	4419891	Yeah.
4421721	4428164	Yeah, I mean, like I said, it'll probably work out, but just me, I know in my case, the way my hands are, I know it's not going to work too well for me.
4429124	4433886	I was thinking about something else that totally slipped my mind because that was the main thing I wanted to talk about.
4435527	4437148	Talk about the live 365 thing.
4437168	4438028	That does suck.
4438609	4440309	That does suck major balls, I know.
4440650	4442590	It sucks and it's nice.
4442630	4448173	I'm hearing from people who are offering to help pay for the increased fees and all that, which I think is really nice.
4449310	4457402	I just want everybody to understand part of the reason that we're leaving is because we disagree with the rate increase of such significance and the fact that
4458203	4463227	Maybe it's just time for the station to have a kick in the butt and try something a little different.
4463247	4466389	You know, we've been doing it the same way for five and a half years.
4466469	4470392	So we're just trying to see the positives in what is kind of otherwise a depressing thing.
4470412	4475416	And I know it's really going to suck because it displaces our weeknight shows, at least for right now.
4475496	4477838	I mean, we're hoping we can take them with us wherever we end up.
4478339	4482101	But, you know, it's going to be some growing pains.
4482262	4485304	But I'm hoping in the long run it actually ends up as a good thing.
4486624	4490406	Well, I gotta say, if you ever need a spot for Shoutcast, we got lines open.
4491606	4492406	I appreciate it.
4492826	4496628	And I know a lot of people are saying Shoutcast, and it's definitely a possibility.
4498209	4500409	We have ideas, and we'll see what happens.
4500430	4504911	The thing about Shoutcast, too, is you gotta pay for music licensing if we were gonna do something like that.
4506872	4509173	But then again, we're all in video game music.
4509193	4514175	I think no matter what happens, unfortunately, we're gonna have to get rid of our licensed music in terms of
4514588	4515088	DarkSakura.com
4540450	4540870	But I don't know.
4540890	4543111	When it comes to video game music, it feels differently to me.
4543251	4545191	I don't think, you know, it seems like a different realm.
4545791	4548072	I would go underground with video game music.
4548132	4548932	I think we'd be okay.
4549612	4550292	Yeah.
4550412	4551093	Yeah.
4551213	4552513	Like I said, good luck on that one.
4552533	4553093	Thank you.
4554233	4559955	Like I said, other than that, though, of course, me being the Phantasy Star Universe fanatic that I'm finally back on the game and whatnot.
4560015	4562035	It's officially White Day in the game and whatnot.
4562655	4569077	I keep meaning to sign on and just kind of like play around in Phantasy Star Universe and see if I, I don't know, like it again.
4570883	4572704	But I keep getting sidetracked.
4572744	4573985	Stupid WoW and stuff like that.
4574826	4577829	Well, Gary said you can't really enjoy it unless you get the expansion, of course.
4577889	4581753	Once you get the expansion, then yeah, you can enjoy the newer stuff.
4581793	4589640	But I mean, if you still just have the basic ones, you won't be able to do all the new stuff and whatnot.
4589660	4590280	Expansion is what?
4590300	4590280	$20?
4590320	4590280	$15?
4590340	4590280	$20? $20?
4592874	4593995	Um, I don't know.
4594575	4595696	I really don't know.
4595956	4598198	I know on live you can download it.
4598438	4599679	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
4599699	4601920	Because I have to uninstall it.
4601940	4602520	40 bucks?
4602680	4603221	Jeez.
4603281	4604542	I don't know about that.
4605802	4614208	Yeah, I mean, like I said, I still play that game because it keeps me from playing it.
4614308	4616089	It's the only game I play on my PlayStation 2 now.
4616109	4616869	That's the sad part.
4618427	4619647	I don't play anything else on it.
4620188	4620768	But anyway.
4621308	4623109	Anything else you want to share, Dark Knight, with our listeners?
4624289	4625190	No, that's about it.
4625350	4627310	But permission to plug?
4628691	4629831	Oh, hell, why not?
4629851	4630692	Because we like you.
4631592	4632272	Okay.
4632693	4636994	I kind of blend my voice to two shows on a radio station called This Is Genius Radio.
4637534	4639735	One is my show called DJ Dark Knight's Ninja Dojo.
4639935	4646498	And another one is called Anime Damashii on there, which is hosted by the Rob D, me, Foodie Monster.
4647546	4651848	and I guess the others, which is basically anime podcast shows.
4653349	4654109	Tune in if you like.
4654149	4655930	We got a podcast out and everything.
4656811	4657051	Nice.
4657911	4658672	Alright, that's it.
4659432	4659952	Have a good night.
4659972	4660813	Enjoy your Easter.
4660993	4661473	Talk to y'all later.
4661713	4662474	Alright, have a good one.
4663194	4663394	Bye.
4663654	4663834	Bye.
4663854	4665635	What do you think?
4665735	4666276	One more call?
4666756	4667556	We'll do one more call.
4667576	4667776	Sure.
4668377	4671338	Uno mas.
4671358	4674960	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4677446	4687512	If we are going to be doing a break from live broadcasting for a little while and going to tape, we will be sure to have more time for calls next week as we say goodbye to Life Thieves 5.
4687552	4691634	Because believe it or not, next week is going to be our last show on Life Thieves 5, no matter what.
4692095	4692775	It's kind of odd.
4693676	4695377	Kind of scary, in a way.
4696617	4696737	Eh.
4697878	4698018	Eh.
4698058	4699219	That's why Loki's attitude.
4699519	4699619	Eh.
4700980	4701400	Whatever.
4703041	4704482	You have any other last minute stories for us, Loki?
4704502	4704582	Okay.
4704960	4712027	Yeah, this week in the U.S., Virtual Console will be getting King's Night on the NES and Powerball on Genesis.
4713108	4714990	I don't know what either one of those are.
4716151	4717252	Sorry, that was something else.
4718093	4718894	I'm saving it for later.
4720115	4722517	Okay.
4722978	4723658	Let's see here.
4724559	4728563	Also, what have we got here?
4729172	4736239	Apparently some idiot is working on Mac OS X or something that resembles Mac OS X for the PSP.
4737400	4737820	Why?
4738881	4739221	Why?
4742084	4748170	There's some homebrew thing that someone made apparently that will remove duplicate channels that you may have from playing import games.
4749551	4750252	So that's kind of neat.
4750272	4752414	Let's see here.
4754096	4754316	And...
4757515	4765637	Some rumors from EGM, including Tecmo Bowl is heading to the Wii, and the classic version of the game is coming to the DS.
4766137	4773519	And apparently Warren Spector's new Disney project that he's working on is a platformer, and the goal is to give Mario a run for his money.
4773900	4777140	The star of the big platformer would be none other than Mickey Mouse.
4779601	4779901	Hmm.
4780741	4781302	Be interesting.
4782302	4782662	That's it.
4783717	4783997	All right.
4784017	4787898	Well, we're actually going to go ahead and close the Skype line because I just realized we are running a little bit long.
4787958	4793259	It's already midnight on the East Coast, 9 o'clock here, so we'll take plenty more calls next week.
4793299	4793719	Don't worry.
4794199	4798159	We're going to go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thoughts, though, in the meantime, because we're about ready to wrap up.
4798259	4800280	So, DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight?
4800800	4801320	Milkshake.
4803920	4806841	My final thought is I would really like my appetite back.
4807941	4808261	Loki?
4808801	4811422	My final thought is this chair is really uncomfortable.
4812282	4812802	Sorry about that.
4812982	4813282	It's all right.
4814216	4817561	Hey, if I can find another fluffy chair like DarkSakura's for cheap, I'll get one of those.
4817781	4822969	This is metal, and that's why I keep standing up, because it... Oh, I'm sorry.
4823786	4824807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4847821	4851102	and help Independent Radio break through because we don't have advertising dollars.
4851442	4853063	We don't have big magazines behind us.
4853103	4853883	We don't have any of that.
4854403	4856724	So that's going to do it.
4858545	4861385	So until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.
4862266	4863166	That's DarkSakura.
4863846	4864506	He's Loki.
4865227	4868268	And together, we are Orange Lounge Radio.
