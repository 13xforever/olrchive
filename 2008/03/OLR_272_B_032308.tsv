5700	11600	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

15000	19500	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	26300	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Easter Sunday, March 23rd of 2008.
26300	28500	We are live here in the studio.
28500	30900	We had some unfortunate news a little earlier on.
30900	33500	If you haven't heard it yet, go back and listen to part A.
34200	36200	Big changes coming to OLR very soon.
36200	39200	And hopefully next week we'll have more information on that for you.
39200	43800	But in the meantime, the show goes on and it will go on as it always has.
43800	48000	And it will go on right now with Loki spreading the rumors.
48500	51000	Yes, and this rumor keeps coming back around.
52900	56600	Remember last week we talked a bit about Reggie teasing
56600	60400	that they're going to announce a major holiday blockbuster game
60400	64200	that will be coming, or the announcement will be coming at E3.
64200	67100	And of course, people are speculating on what the hell that is.
67100	68800	We thought maybe Animal Crossing.
68800	74800	However, some people over at IGN think it might be Kid Icarus because...
74800	76600	Hey, wait a minute. That was my Dark Horse pick.
76600	79800	Copiers? Plagiarists?
79800	84300	But according to the latest Nintendo voice chat podcast,
84300	91800	Matt Casamassina, and I guess the rest of their crew there,
91800	94500	were speculating that they thought it was Kid Icarus
94500	96200	because they know it's in the works.
97200	99200	How do they know it's in the works?
99200	100600	I don't fucking know, nor do I care.
101200	105500	To be honest, as much as I think Kid Icarus is pretty cool,
105500	108200	I don't think that's going to be a blockbuster game, you know what I mean?
108200	110600	Unless it has Mario and shit in it.
110600	113100	Unfortunately, the casual gamer out there,
113100	117000	I mean, like your mom and pops, probably we don't give a shit about Kid Icarus.
117000	120600	I don't know, I think you underestimate the fanboys.
120600	125400	I would say that it'd be cool if a Kid Icarus game came out.
125400	127100	I don't think it's the game he's talking about.
127100	129200	I think Animal Crossing is the game he's talking about,
129200	131200	but if there is a Kid Icarus game in the works,
131200	133600	I mean, they'll be pretty big, but...
133600	137200	I don't think it is the game that they're going to be announcing.
137200	140600	I think it could be a game they're announcing.
140600	141900	Yeah, a game, yes.
141900	143200	The game, no.
143200	145900	Well, then, Loki, consider this news, and we're going to come back and talk about this,
145900	147300	but I want to get out this news,
147300	151600	is that Super Smash Bros. Brawl shatters records everywhere.
151600	157400	1.4 million sold in the first week it's been out in the US.
157400	161900	That's crazy, 874,000 of those on the day it was released alone.
161900	166600	That makes it the fastest selling video game in Nintendo of America's history,
166600	168600	dating all the way back to the NES.
168600	171700	And, you know, no surprise, this game was going to be a big seller,
171700	174900	but this was a, like, really big seller.
174900	181000	The game is sold at a rate of more than 120 units per minute
181000	184400	between the day it launched, March 9th and March 16th.
184400	187400	So that is a huge selling game.
187400	190600	And RosteelUT, though, is the first to point out...
190600	192800	He's Debbie Downer UT right now.
192800	194900	He says, still slower than Halo 3.
194900	196900	Wah, wah.
196900	200400	But, I mean, it is kind of a good point.
200400	205200	It didn't sell quite as much as some of the guys on Xbox did,
205200	207700	but still a huge seller for Nintendo nonetheless.
207700	209200	Yeah.
209200	212000	And also you have to remember, too,
212000	217300	that they don't have as many units of the Wii right now as they do the 360.
217300	220300	They're still number two in the US.
220300	224200	But, I mean, not by much, so that doesn't really make a big difference.
224200	227500	Is it a big deal that it didn't meet up to those Halo 3-type numbers?
227500	231400	No, I don't think they were ever...
231400	234000	It made history for Nintendo,
234000	237200	so I think that they're more than pleased about it.
237200	240300	I don't think they really have to live up to being like Halo,
240300	241500	because you know what?
241500	243900	Fucking Grand Theft Auto's gonna outsell Halo anyways,
243900	247200	so who gives a shit about your fucking Halo numbers right now?
247200	250200	I mean, that's gonna get blown out of the water soon anyways.
250200	251700	So, I don't know.
251700	254100	And really, Halo 3, yeah, it sold a lot
254100	256000	because there was so much hype behind it and shit,
256000	258900	but was it really that great of a game?
258900	262100	All right, so going back to the story earlier about Kid Icarus,
262100	264800	would it be a game that people would recognize or not?
264800	266000	This is a huge game.
266000	267800	Pit is a character in the game.
267800	271500	It does a good job at kind of reminding you that Kid Icarus is out there,
271500	275200	what with the virtual console thing and the stages and the music.
275200	278000	You know, it's one of the first things you see in Subspace Emissary,
278000	279800	is the whole Pit coming to life thing.
279800	282600	True, but does that mean we're also gonna get like a Rob the Robot,
282600	284500	which I would totally buy that day.
284500	287400	I would totally buy that day one, absolutely.
287400	289500	Fuck yes, bring back Rob the Robot.
289500	292900	In fact, make my old one compatible with the Wii.
292900	293700	That would be cool,
293700	296600	because then mine would actually be good for something other than sitting on the shelf.
296600	298300	Yeah, I mean, like,
298300	301000	can Rob do anything besides spin things?
301000	302800	You know what they need to know?
302800	304600	You know what they need to do with Rob the Robot?
304600	307500	They need to make it like one of those fucking Robosapien things,
307500	310200	or like fucking Furbies where you can program the shit out of that.
310200	312400	Or the, uh, what, Ibo?
312400	313800	Ibo, yeah.
313800	317800	Just, like, something like that, just like really crazy, you know,
317800	320900	get people to buy that shit that wouldn't have a Wii or something like that,
320900	322800	and just go crazy with it.
322800	324600	But, I mean, I don't know about you guys, but like,
324600	326000	when I was playing Smash Brothers Brawl,
326000	327800	and I played that Subspace Emissary mode,
327800	329300	and I saw the Kid Icarus thing,
329300	332800	and with the music and him flying through the air, flying down to Earth,
332800	334500	and with the music playing, I'm like,
334500	336700	God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game now.
336700	338800	Like, that was initially the first thought in my mind,
338800	341600	and I think we might have even been broadcasting on Justin.TV,
341600	343100	uh, when, when I was doing that in the game,
343100	344800	and I, I seem to remember exclaiming,
344800	347800	God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game right now.
347800	350100	Like, a new one.
350100	351100	Maybe.
351100	352800	I hope so.
352800	355400	Uh, Tiger Claw says if they do the new Kid Icarus,
355400	358800	it's no doubt that they would also have to bring back the Eggplant Wizard.
358800	362400	Hell yes, the Eggplant Wizard was also a very memorable character.
362400	366800	Everybody knew him as the annoyingest little fucker in video gaming history.
366800	368400	One of the most annoying characters, seriously.
368400	370600	You know what's great, though, about being turned into an eggplant, though?
370600	371100	What?
371100	373600	Is it if you press down to where you can see his feet,
373600	375100	and then you slide across the floor as an eggplant?
375100	375600	Yes.
375600	378600	It's like, it's like, uh, Metal Gear Solid Eggplant.
378600	380100	It's great!
380100	381100	I know, I love that, too.
381100	382600	You just hope that nothing saw you.
382600	385600	And, and you can even hold it down and jump as an eggplant,
385600	386600	and that was great, too.
386600	390600	And you, and, and who knew that hospitals could cure the eggplant curse?
390600	392100	I know!
392100	396600	Although, you could also turn into an eggplant from watching too much TV.
396600	398600	This is true.
398600	401600	Well, anyhow, uh, huge numbers for Smash Bros. Brawl,
401600	404600	and I'm sure this game's just gonna continue to sell through Christmas,
404600	407600	so, uh, we'll see how it holds up throughout the year.
407600	411600	Well, in other news, dun dun dun.
411600	414600	Okay, well,
414600	419600	we know we were talking about how Namco was talking about, you know,
419600	422600	not too many people are, uh, playing their games.
422600	424600	Well, I should say Bandai Namco.
424600	429600	Um, but now they're talking about, well, actually, they'd also blamed it on the Wii, too,
429600	430600	which I think is kind of stupid.
430600	434600	But now they're talking about, um, bringing out games, um,
434600	439600	that will combine the arcade and Wii titles to where,
439600	445600	I guess they'll, they'll share scores or that they'll have some sort of interactivity,
445600	449600	but it would be for a data exchange between the different versions of the games.
449600	451600	And you know what I have to say about that?
451600	452600	Neo Geo.
452600	454100	And you know what I have to say about that?
454100	457600	F-Zero GX.
457600	460600	And you know what I have to say about that?
460600	463600	Nothing. I just wanted to join in.
463600	469600	No, seriously, though, I mean, they were part of the whole Triforce system that, you know,
469600	472600	I think that was only pretty much used for the F-Zero GX stuff,
472600	478600	but, uh, you know, it had cross, uh, platform stuff between, um, the arcade and the GameCube,
478600	481600	so let's do something similar with SD memory cards,
481600	482600	because those are widely available.
482600	488100	Fuck, what, two gig memory card for, uh, $9.99 at Fry's today.
488100	489100	That's pretty awesome.
489100	497100	Um, but anyways, they've got, you know, they could do that very simple and exchange data back and forth.
497100	501600	I think it's smart to make arcades like a gamer's hub,
501600	504600	and I know that kind of sounds like a big duh type of answer,
504600	509600	but I think it's smart to kind of make your arcade games somehow talk to the console games
509600	514600	and give gamers a reason to sort of convene in one place, in real life, outside,
514600	517600	you know, not having to use Xbox Live and rely on that type of stuff.
517600	519600	I think these kind of ideas are smart.
519600	522600	Can you imagine, like, a Smash Bros. arcade game or something like that,
522600	528100	like, done on a huge screen, you know, with four, uh, joysticks, you know, set up and stuff,
528100	531100	and then have, like, additional characters and all that stuff?
531100	535600	Or things that unlock based on what you do on the home version, and things like that.
535600	538100	Absolutely. That would be rad.
538100	540100	sj100matt in chat says,
540100	542100	Loki, one could dream.
542100	544100	I agree, one could dream.
545100	548100	So, we'll see what happens with this.
548100	553100	Another cool thing that probably will never come to fruition, but, you know,
553100	556100	at least with all the buzz that's going around about it,
556100	561600	but a fan of Metroid 2 is actually working on a remake of the game
561600	564600	that he's been working on right now for about three years now.
564600	566600	Metroid 2 Return of Samus.
566600	569100	Um, awesome looking thing.
569100	572100	He's using sprites from Metroid Zero Mission,
572100	577600	as well as the remake of the classic Game Boy game,
577600	579100	and some other sprites.
579100	583100	He's also hand-drawing from the ground-up, I guess, Metroid Fusion,
583100	585100	which is the other game he's using,
585100	588100	and using the program Game Maker 7,
588100	591600	the guy who goes by Dr. M64,
591600	596100	and totally awesome looking game so far.
596100	600100	They've actually got a, I guess, not really a beta or demo,
600100	605100	but a proof-of-concept demo, I guess, that you can download and play
605100	607100	straight off of a bunch of websites,
607100	609100	and if you're interested in checking it out,
609100	613100	it's metroid2remake.blogspot.com for the website.
613100	617100	And we have a little YouTube that TigerClaw sent us of this in action.
617100	623100	Neat, looks like Super Metroid.
626100	629100	I imagine that's not the sound in-game.
629100	631100	No, they actually do have an in-game...
631100	633100	I don't think this is it, though, is it?
633100	635100	No, that's the actual game, but that's not the...
635100	637100	Damn, the game looks good, though.
637100	639100	It looks like Super Metroid.
641100	643100	That's not a bad thing.
643100	646100	Nice wall jumping.
648100	651100	I approve. This looks good.
653100	656100	Yeah, I hope the project doesn't get shut down by players or something.
656100	659100	Oh, there you have it.
662100	665100	Mackman says, oh shit, I thought it was going to be a Rickroll.
665100	667100	No, I trust TigerClaw's links.
667100	669100	Some of you other people, I don't know so much.
669100	671100	I might get Rickrolled by you,
671100	674100	so don't think I'm not going to check.
674100	676100	Rickroll, you get blacklisted.
676100	679100	That's right, you Rickroll me, I ban you.
679100	681100	That shit was funny like three months ago.
681100	685100	It's a little old now, so please do not be Rickrolling.
685100	688100	Anyhow, Metroid 2, yes, I approve.
688100	691100	And I hope the project doesn't get Rickrolled by lawyers.
691100	692100	That would suck.
692100	696100	Just like, was it the 3D remake of Chrono Trigger?
696100	697100	That sucks.
697100	699100	Oh, that thing looked hot, too.
699100	701100	You remember seeing that that game looked hot.
701100	703100	They apparently are making the full version.
703100	705100	The people they're working on, they're going to make it for themselves,
705100	707100	but they can't release it because...
707100	710100	Oh, that shit will end up a bit torn so fast.
710100	713100	Well, they still could get in trouble, I think.
713100	714100	Yeah.
714100	717100	All right, anyhow, today is Easter,
717100	719100	and so I guess this news is going to be a little bit old
719100	721100	for some of our podcast listeners,
721100	723100	but this is just too cool.
723100	726100	Some people were seeing this earlier this week.
726100	731100	Nintendo Miis, as in the characters that you create on Wiis,
731100	735100	were being used to advertise Easter service at a San Francisco church.
735100	736100	Yes, that's right.
736100	739100	They used a little Mii that looks like Jesus
739100	742100	standing next to a bunny that looks a little grumpy,
742100	744100	and the little postcard says,
744100	748100	Come and Follow Mii, M-I-I.
748100	751100	And it was Easter Sunday, which was today at 11 a.m.
751100	753100	at the Mission Bay Community Church.
753100	756100	So, you know, just clever ways of advertising.
756100	759100	And, you know, I like churches that are hip and with it,
759100	762100	and I like churches that don't feel like
762100	763100	they're still living in the Old Testament.
763100	765100	Did you see the one that was the wedding invitation
765100	767100	that had the two Miis on there?
767100	768100	No, I don't think I saw that.
768100	772100	And then when you open it up, it says, Wife Get.
772100	776100	That's awesome.
776100	778100	That's awesome.
778100	780100	That sounds like something that Mel and Mel,
780100	783100	my buddies would be doing for their wedding.
783100	786100	Sounds like something they would do.
786100	790100	Nice.
790100	792100	That actually, yeah.
792100	793100	That is very cute.
793100	797100	I like cute, innovative ways of doing things.
797100	798100	All right, bless you.
798100	799100	Are you okay?
799100	801100	I'm allergic to...
801100	802100	Something here in the studio?
802100	803100	Are you allergic to me?
803100	804100	Are you allergic to Jesus?
804100	806100	That might be a problem.
806100	807100	Mildly.
807100	808100	All right.
808100	810100	Well, hopefully you're not allergic to mail
810100	812100	because this is the part of the show
812100	814100	where you're going to read some for us
814100	815100	as the listeners email us
815100	819100	at mailbag at orangesonsradio.com.
819100	822100	Did we get better participation this week than last week?
822100	825100	Well, we did get some interesting emails
825100	828100	and one of them is from our friend Rob Booktubes,
828100	832100	but he didn't provide the link to the article in the email,
832100	835100	so he's basically just talking about an article
835100	837100	about the outcome of the guy who,
837100	838100	I'm just going to read this from the start.
838100	841100	Here's a pretty good article on the outcome of that guy
841100	844100	who bludgeoned a baby to death for accidentally breaking the Xbox.
844100	846100	Some interesting stuff in that article.
846100	849100	One, the article does not imply
849100	851100	the guy was playing his Xbox at the time.
851100	853100	Two, the article does not specify
853100	855100	if the murder happened immediately after the Xbox broke
855100	857100	or when Spellman the convicted discovered it.
857100	861100	Three, social workers visited the house regularly
861100	864100	and four, the autopsy showed evidence of prior abuse.
864100	867100	It implies a pattern of abuse that shows the man
867100	869100	was a ticking time bomb.
869100	871100	As you said when the story probably came out,
871100	873100	it wasn't really about games at all.
873100	877100	So...
877100	878100	Exactly.
878100	881100	Pretty much, you know, it's no surprise
881100	884100	that the media, you know, hopped all over this
884100	885100	trying to make it a video game thing
885100	887100	when it really had nothing to do with that.
887100	889100	No surprise there.
889100	891100	But thanks for the update, nevertheless.
891100	892100	I'm not saying that at you.
892100	894100	I'm just saying that in general.
894100	896100	Like, here goes the media again.
896100	897100	Video games are evil.
897100	898100	Blah, blah, blah.
898100	899100	Big surprise.
899100	904100	Well, also, Nige linked me a story on CBBC
904100	907100	that is actually pretty cool.
907100	913100	It's more just pictures of a bunch of people.
913100	915100	A lot of people dressed up as Mario,
915100	919100	but also others dressed up as different characters.
919100	921100	Like, there's a giant Spyro here,
921100	922100	a very well-made costume,
922100	924100	just walking around that says
924100	926100	they're trying to break a record,
926100	927100	but I don't see...
927100	929100	They broke a record for the most cosplayers
929100	930100	in one spot, I guess,
930100	931100	or something like 80.
931100	933100	It was just 80 cosplayers.
933100	934100	What?
934100	938100	I think the average anime convention
938100	941100	could break that, like, in a heartbeat.
941100	943100	I think specifically, though,
943100	945100	that these are all video game characters.
945100	947100	Speaking of anime conventions,
947100	949100	I was told via a text message earlier this week,
949100	951100	I don't know if it actually ended up happening or not,
951100	953100	because I didn't get any text messages tonight,
953100	955100	but I'm being told that our show is right now
955100	957100	being played at Anime Boston.
957100	958100	So if that's true,
958100	960100	a big hello to you kids at Anime Boston.
960100	962100	And you know who sent me a text message,
962100	965100	so I know for a fact you guys are listening in there,
965100	967100	because I don't see anybody in chat or what have you.
967100	968100	But then again, my phone's in the house,
968100	970100	so maybe that's what happened.
970100	972100	Well, if you've got the mind, text me.
972100	973100	Yeah, there you go.
973100	974100	Well, that's pretty cool.
974100	976100	Hi, people.
976100	977100	And here's the thing.
977100	978100	What you need to do right now,
978100	980100	or not right now because you're listening to the show,
980100	981100	but as soon as the show's over,
981100	983100	all you bitches need to get your cosplay gear on
983100	987100	and get 81 of you together and shatter the record.
987100	988100	Do it.
988100	991100	Dude, I would participate in that one
991100	993100	if I had a finished costume right now.
993100	997100	Yeah, the record was for the largest gathering of game characters,
997100	999100	or games characters.
999100	1001100	All right, so you guys have to dig through your luggage
1001100	1003100	and get your game ones specifically.
1003100	1005100	Just gather a whole crap load of Guilty Gear cosplayers.
1005100	1007100	You'll be happy and done.
1007100	1010100	And remember, would Naruto count?
1010100	1012100	Because technically they have Naruto games,
1012100	1015100	but Naruto is an anime character.
1015100	1016100	That's kind of a gray area.
1016100	1020100	In fact, a lot of anime characters are games in Japan, right?
1020100	1022100	I think it counts.
1022100	1023100	Next email.
1023100	1025100	All right, yes, next email.
1025100	1027100	And this is from GS68.
1027100	1031100	Hey, O.O.R. Crew, since Dark Sakura,
1031100	1035100	if I recall correctly, isn't going to fight on me this year,
1035100	1037100	will you still do a panel there?
1037100	1040100	It's one of the things I looked forward to last year.
1040100	1043100	If we are invited to, then yes.
1043100	1045100	I don't see why not.
1045100	1046100	Do we always submit?
1046100	1047100	I thought somebody submitted for us.
1047100	1048100	You always have to submit.
1048100	1050100	I submitted the last two years.
1050100	1052100	Are they accepting right now?
1052100	1053100	Yes.
1053100	1054100	Oh, I guess we have to submit then.
1054100	1055100	I don't know.
1055100	1056100	Loki, are we still going to do a panel?
1056100	1057100	Sure, I can try that.
1057100	1058100	Why not?
1058100	1060100	We'll bring a mannequin.
1060100	1061100	I'll let you take one of my doffies.
1061100	1062100	And put an angry face on it.
1062100	1063100	We'll say it's Chibi.
1063100	1065100	I'll make you a very small doffie to take with you.
1065100	1068100	Yeah, we'll still do a panel if they'll let us.
1068100	1070100	Why not?
1070100	1071100	Well, next email.
1071100	1073100	Hello, it's DJ Jinai again.
1073100	1075100	Thanks for reading my email last week.
1075100	1076100	I was surprised.
1076100	1080100	I knew about the Smile DK news for a good month.
1080100	1082100	As soon as it was okay to release the news to the public,
1082100	1084100	O.O.R. was the first place I went to tell.
1084100	1085100	A bit about me.
1085100	1088100	Yes, I'm an actual DJ and I live in Las Vegas.
1088100	1090100	Arcades are still alive here.
1090100	1092100	I usually mix anime and video game music.
1092100	1094100	But when it comes to DJ anime conventions,
1094100	1097100	I got my start as a DJ at Fanime Con 2002.
1097100	1099100	That's cool.
1099100	1102100	I'll be going to San Japan Con to meet with Smile DK.
1102100	1104100	I might faint when I meet them.
1104100	1105100	Hee hee.
1105100	1107100	Other conventions I'll be attending are
1107100	1109100	AntiJam in Fresno, California
1109100	1113100	and Anime Vegas Con in, wait for it, Las Vegas, Gasp.
1113100	1116100	So yes, I have a Wii and I will be waiting for Mario Kart Wii.
1116100	1119100	I'm surprised that they removed snaking.
1119100	1123100	Well, I'll find another new strategy to overcome that mwahaha.
1123100	1126100	I'm also surprised at how easy it is to find Brawl
1126100	1129100	and still no Wii consoles to be found.
1129100	1131100	I haven't eaten at Olive Garden yet.
1131100	1133100	I want to have my first Olive Garden experience with O.L.R.
1133100	1135100	I can only dream.
1135100	1136100	Bye, DJ Genai.
1136100	1138100	P.S. You pronounce my name right.
1138100	1141100	You win an internet and a Mudkip X3.
1141100	1142100	You know, ironically enough,
1142100	1144100	I might actually be going to Vegas in a couple months,
1144100	1145100	so it's on.
1145100	1147100	Olive Garden like what?
1147100	1148100	There's a good Olive Garden in town,
1148100	1151100	which I hope there's got to be in Las Vegas, right?
1151100	1152100	There's got to be.
1152100	1153100	There's got to be an Olive Garden.
1153100	1156100	No, there's no Olive Garden in Las Vegas.
1156100	1157100	That would suck.
1157100	1159100	Suck for Vegas.
1159100	1163100	So I'm like, I seem to recall I was in the middle of BFE Pennsylvania
1163100	1164100	and there was an Olive Garden there.
1164100	1166100	I wouldn't be surprised if there was the Olive Garden casino in the works.
1166100	1170100	DJ Genai is in chat and says, yes, there is an Olive Garden.
1170100	1171100	If I get three breadsticks,
1171100	1173100	does the machine spit out never-ending breadsticks?
1173100	1175100	And Sauce confirmed that there are a few.
1175100	1177100	Thank you.
1177100	1181100	And the reason I pronounced your name right is because I'm not Rob.
1181100	1184100	Rob Steele, shut up.
1184100	1186100	And Rob Steele UT has a good point.
1186100	1190100	He says, why would you go to Vegas and then go to Olive's shithouse?
1190100	1193100	That's actually a good point because Vegas has so many great restaurants.
1193100	1194100	Why the fuck would I go to Olive Garden?
1194100	1195100	I'll tell you where I would want to go.
1195100	1196100	Where?
1196100	1201100	I would want to go to the Rio and go to the seafood buffet,
1201100	1206100	the massive seafood buffet that I went to on the DDR Freak moderator trip
1206100	1208100	that ate a lot of my money.
1208100	1210100	I need to go back to Quark's Bar.
1210100	1211100	Get me a warp core breach.
1211100	1213100	I can do one of those myself.
1213100	1215100	I am so going to Vegas in a couple months.
1215100	1216100	I can't wait.
1216100	1217100	I want to go.
1217100	1219100	My 30th birthday.
1219100	1221100	I still have to get you your present, you know.
1221100	1222100	I know.
1222100	1223100	I already bought you your present.
1223100	1225100	Your birthday's not until next month.
1225100	1226100	I am.
1226100	1228100	Well, I love my present, but I have a special present for you
1228100	1232100	that falls in line with my present from my 30th.
1232100	1233100	Sweet.
1233100	1235100	I'll be looking forward to that.
1235100	1238100	I'll be looking forward to helping you with it.
1238100	1239100	All right.
1239100	1242100	No, we have more e-mails.
1242100	1243100	Yay.
1243100	1247100	If you are ready for said e-mail.
1247100	1250100	This is, hey guys, let's have tea here.
1250100	1251100	Cool, I'd like some tea.
1251100	1252100	Thank you.
1252100	1254100	Oh, wish I could be listening live tonight,
1254100	1256100	but I'm on a plane right now flying home,
1256100	1261100	so there's not really internet access on airplanes.
1261100	1264100	Anyhow, years back, Rob did a review on trace memory
1264100	1265100	for the Nintendo DS.
1265100	1267100	Trace memory is actually called another code
1267100	1270100	outside the US for any international listeners,
1270100	1273100	and he went off on how amazing the game is.
1273100	1275100	After I heard that episode, I went out and bought the game,
1275100	1277100	and I agree with his reaction to it.
1277100	1279100	It was an amazing game.
1279100	1282100	Recently, I found a game that was made by the same company.
1282100	1286100	Hotel Duskroom 215 uses DS in the same way that trace memory did,
1286100	1288100	but with a little more guidance to it.
1288100	1291100	Oftentimes, in trace memory, I'd get lost and confused,
1291100	1294100	but that rarely happened in Hotel Dusk.
1294100	1297100	The puzzles in Hotel Dusk are generally pretty neat
1297100	1299100	and are excellent ways to use the touch screen.
1299100	1301100	The game is so incredibly well written
1301100	1304100	that it feels like you're actually interacting with the other people in the hotel.
1304100	1306100	Excuse me.
1306100	1308100	And for those of you who have no clue what trace memory is,
1308100	1312100	it's a point-and-click adventure game that uses the DS hardware to the fullest.
1312100	1315100	The game is filled with all sorts of little puzzles that you have to solve,
1315100	1317100	and most of them are very well thought out.
1317100	1320100	There's even one puzzle where you have to shut the DS
1320100	1323100	just so that you can see the reflection from one side of the screen and the other
1323100	1327100	in order to understand a riddle.
1327100	1330100	At any rate, check out both of these games.
1330100	1332100	Very goodbyes.
1332100	1335100	Take care, and please don't forget to save the podcast feed.
1335100	1337100	I'll need something to listen to on the flight back.
1337100	1340100	Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got it taken care of now.
1340100	1342100	You know what's funny?
1342100	1347100	I've never played trace memory, so I don't know how I reviewed it on the show.
1347100	1350100	I have a feeling it was Miklotov that played it.
1350100	1351100	Yeah, it wasn't him.
1351100	1354100	I think it was Miklotov, not me.
1354100	1361100	And I've been advised that you need to go to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.
1361100	1363100	Ooh, Margaritas. I'm down with that.
1363100	1364100	Okay.
1364100	1366100	So, last email.
1366100	1367100	No!
1367100	1369100	I need tragic music for this.
1369100	1371100	Anyway.
1371100	1376100	What was the song in Beatmania 4th Mix that was the Gothi song?
1376100	1378100	I don't know.
1378100	1380100	Hey, OLR. Shout-on here.
1380100	1384100	I was going through some old episodes somewhere in the late 100s,
1384100	1391100	and noticed that Rob at one point brought up Feel the Magic and repeatedly griped about Sprung.
1391100	1393100	This got me thinking.
1393100	1398100	Have any of you ever been interested in the visual novel genre?
1398100	1400100	Not many visual novels have been brought over to the US,
1400100	1404100	the Ace Attorney series being among the most well-known one on American shores.
1404100	1409100	However, many more visual novels that are, in my opinion,
1409100	1413100	vastly superior to the Ace Attorney series are unlikely to be released outside of Japan,
1413100	1418100	even though it wouldn't be a big deal to edit them like with many other games.
1418100	1422100	So I guess the main question of this paragraph would be whether or not any of you,
1422100	1427100	mainly Jamie, have imported or pirated Japanese visual novels such as Fate,
1427100	1431100	Stay Night, Tsukihime, or Clannad,
1431100	1434100	two of which have been fairly popular anime based off of them.
1434100	1438100	I mean, FSN and Clannad, there was no Tsukihime anime.
1438100	1440100	Was that just fan art?
1440100	1444100	Actually, I did have one, and I actually heard of this one when the Sega CD was new,
1444100	1447100	and it was called Takaru.
1447100	1454100	I had remembered seeing that they were going to bring it out in the US,
1454100	1457100	but it never did on Sega CD, if I recall correctly.
1457100	1460100	However, I have a PC version of it that's fully translated.
1460100	1464100	I've definitely heard of Clannad before, but I haven't played it myself.
1464100	1467100	I've heard of the band.
1467100	1469100	Yeah, I hope I'm not getting confused with the band.
1469100	1471100	No, I'm pretty sure I'm not. I've heard of the game.
1471100	1473100	I think that's Enya's sister.
1473100	1479100	Anyway, there's a few of them that I've heard of,
1479100	1486100	and they sort of did something like that one for the Silent Hill comics too,
1486100	1488100	at least they tried to, but it didn't.
1488100	1492100	It was more just like, oh, we're going to have dramatic music with the comic book panels.
1492100	1494100	Okay, so that wasn't quite the same thing.
1494100	1496100	Anyway, moving forward.
1496100	1499100	Anyway, the next question involves an email you received last week
1499100	1503100	that concerned the length of arcade shooters like Gradius being too short.
1503100	1507100	I completely agree with Jamie that taking the time to get a high score or play through
1507100	1511100	on one credit in games like these gives bragging rights.
1511100	1515100	This is doubly true of much more difficult games like Japanese Danmaku
1515100	1523100	or bullet hell shooters like Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, or Mushihime-sama.
1523100	1525100	So this leads to my next question.
1525100	1531100	Have any of you ever played any games from the popular PC Danmaku shooter series Toho?
1531100	1536100	The Toho game started on the PC-98 with a game called Highly Responsive to Prayers.
1536100	1541100	The game series features a perpetual protagonist named Reimu Hakurei,
1541100	1548100	a Miko who operates an unpopular and out-of-the-way shrine in the land called Gensokyo.
1548100	1552100	Toho's first appearance on Windows was the embodiment of Scarlet Devil,
1552100	1556100	so if it catches your interest, I would recommend starting with that.
1556100	1560100	The games are very popular for their music, art style, and curtains fire pattern
1560100	1564100	and sense of inner game character development.
1564100	1568100	The games are available for free download on doujinstyle.com,
1568100	1576100	and I would definitely advise anyone who still has fond memories of Radiant Silver Gun to check the series out.
1576100	1579100	Keep up your exemplary work, Charon.
1579100	1584100	I have not played those games, but due to that well-worded free plug, I just might.
1584100	1598100	I'm familiar with Toho's games, but if it was PC, I hardly played it, so I was more of a... I'd brought up Bongayo before. That was one of my favorites.
1598100	1603100	I mean, it was more of a recent one, but I like those kinds of games.
1603100	1607100	Actually, I really, really love Radiant Silver Gun.
1607100	1610100	Alright, well then this sounds like something you ought to check out, too.
1610100	1616100	Well, I was actually pretty thrilled that when, um, that had the aforementioned DDR Freak moderatorship.
1616100	1621100	We went to this place called, um, I want to say Game Land?
1621100	1628100	They've gone out of business since. This was probably in 2000... something?
1628100	1630100	I don't really remember when.
1630100	1633100	Um, but I found a Radiant Silver Gun arcade machine.
1633100	1635100	And played the hell out of it!
1635100	1639100	Everyone's like, ooh, Mambo a Go-Go! Let's go play that!
1639100	1641100	And I'm like, fuck no! I played that, and uh...
1641100	1643100	Mambo a Go-Go was kind of cool, though.
1643100	1649100	It is. But I was too busy on Radiant Silver Gun and Biohazard Gun Survivor 2.
1649100	1650100	Ah.
1652100	1654100	Alright, so that's it for the emails?
1654100	1655100	Yes.
1655100	1657100	Then you have to say, no more emails.
1657100	1658100	No more emails!
1662100	1664100	That's the best ever.
1664100	1666100	You said you wanted some type of sound effects.
1666100	1668100	That was really tragic. That's more humorous.
1668100	1672100	Alright, if you want to send us an email,
1672100	1675100	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send them.
1675100	1678100	Meanwhile, we get back into the news, don't we, Loki?
1678100	1680100	Yes, we do.
1680100	1684100	Um, so, hopefully you haven't bought this already,
1684100	1686100	because if you did, you just wasted some money,
1686100	1694100	but, um, Bungie is now going to be putting out the Halo 3 Legendary Map Pack.
1694100	1697100	I believe it was previously $10.
1697100	1699100	Um, and included three maps.
1699100	1703100	Out for free, starting at 2 AM this Tuesday.
1703100	1706100	So, that sucks.
1706100	1709100	But, um, hey, it's free.
1709100	1711100	And, um, you know what, though?
1711100	1715100	If you're still interested in spending some money on maps,
1715100	1717100	there are some more coming the next Map Pack,
1717100	1721100	which is going to include a Sign Winder remake,
1721100	1723100	or I guess a spiritual remake,
1723100	1727100	including other ones known as Ghost Town,
1727100	1731100	and one other mystery map, I guess.
1731100	1736100	That's going to be coming on the 15th of April.
1736100	1738100	Or if you're like me, you're like,
1738100	1740100	Halo 3 got new maps?
1740100	1741100	Yeah.
1741100	1744100	Like, I stopped playing Halo 3 months ago.
1744100	1746100	Now you can go download them,
1746100	1749100	and then you might as well wait until these maps become free as well,
1749100	1750100	because, you know.
1750100	1752100	Yeah, no, I only download them after they're free.
1752100	1754100	I don't need to pay for them.
1754100	1755100	And, like, I don't know.
1755100	1757100	I used to play Halo 2 with my college buddies a lot,
1757100	1758100	but we really haven't been playing Halo 3.
1758100	1759100	It's kind of sad.
1759100	1760100	Well, what was it?
1760100	1762100	They had a map that they released in the last Map Pack
1762100	1764100	that I want to say was empty,
1764100	1767100	and it was just this big empty warehouse that you could build stuff with.
1767100	1768100	Nice.
1768100	1770100	And it's like, you know,
1770100	1772100	but you can build all these cool things and forge with it.
1772100	1775100	It's like, thanks, but you really didn't do anything.
1775100	1777100	You just made an empty warehouse, you idiot.
1777100	1780100	So, I don't know.
1780100	1783100	All right, well, you can check that out soon.
1783100	1786100	One guy who might actually be back into checking this out
1786100	1791100	was the really depressed guy who had his Xbox 360 ruined by Microsoft.
1791100	1793100	Do you remember this?
1793100	1796100	He had his personalized 360.
1796100	1799100	It was white clean when he did the whole Red Ring of Death fix.
1799100	1800100	Remember that?
1800100	1801100	Yeah.
1801100	1802100	They cleared it all away.
1802100	1805100	PR Nightmare, this story ended up on blogs everywhere.
1805100	1808100	Well, guess what?
1808100	1813100	Apparently, a recent delivery has come from Microsoft back to the same guy.
1813100	1817100	It came with an Xbox 360, a handful of games,
1817100	1821100	and what you should definitely pay attention to is that this new Xbox 360
1821100	1824100	was signed by the entire Xbox team,
1824100	1831100	Bungie, which had also replacement artwork on it by Rooster Teeth Comics' Luke McKay,
1831100	1834100	and Bill Gates signed the front of it.
1834100	1836100	So, he got more than he had before.
1836100	1840100	Yeah, he got a care package from Bungie and also from Microsoft.
1840100	1844100	Way to kiss ass.
1844100	1847100	So, this will probably be the last time you ever hear about this story on the blogs,
1847100	1850100	and now everyone everywhere is screaming,
1850100	1852100	Microsoft, fuck up my 360.
1852100	1855100	I want a cool little care package like this.
1855100	1858100	Dude, the art's pretty cool on it.
1858100	1860100	Yeah, that's pretty rad.
1860100	1862100	Watch this guy just turn around and sell it on eBay.
1862100	1864100	That would be tragic.
1864100	1867100	That would be funny.
1867100	1870100	I want them to draw on my Xbox now.
1870100	1872100	Anyway.
1872100	1875100	They should have a service where you can send in your Xbox and get it drawn on.
1875100	1877100	I guess that is a little silly.
1877100	1882100	I would be happy to provide that service.
1882100	1888100	You pay me $200 and I will customize your Xbox 360 with a Sharpie.
1888100	1890100	Although I'm actually not joking.
1890100	1892100	Send me your faceplate and I'll customize it.
1892100	1894100	If that is a contest, we should get a blank faceplate.
1894100	1896100	They have blank faceplates, right?
1896100	1898100	We can customize it somehow.
1898100	1900100	We have some of the Ace Combat ones that we can paint over.
1900100	1901100	Okay, that'll work.
1901100	1905100	Well, you can just get a faceplate off of a core system or something,
1905100	1907100	and they're white.
1907100	1908100	Oh, there you go.
1908100	1910100	Or actually all the original faceplates are white.
1910100	1912100	That might be fun.
1912100	1913100	Something to do.
1913100	1914100	I have some extra ones.
1914100	1916100	All right, anyway.
1916100	1920100	Well, there's some information that's out now about Bionic Commando Re-Armed,
1920100	1928100	which is the 2D-style Bionic Commando that they're coming out with.
1928100	1932100	The title is supposed to be out in May,
1932100	1938100	and it will be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade for $10, American.
1938100	1942100	And there will be a PC version, but they don't have a price on it yet.
1942100	1948100	But the Xbox Live version is going to actually be for 800 Microsoft points.
1948100	1953100	The PlayStation Network one is $10.
1953100	1960100	And that it will, for the PC version anyway, it will require Windows XP or Vista.
1960100	1962100	I'm so sorry.
1962100	1969100	At least 512 megabytes of RAM and 650 megabytes of hard drive space.
1969100	1975100	And it may or may not have unique content.
1975100	1976100	It may or may not.
1976100	1979100	Well, thank you for covering the full spectrum of possibilities.
1979100	1981100	This game may or may not be good.
1981100	1983100	I have more information.
1983100	1991100	The minimum specs on this is XP Service Pack 2 or Vista.
1991100	1996100	I have a Pentium 4 2 gigahertz or an AMD XP 2200.
1996100	2000100	512 megabytes of RAM, 650 megabytes of hard drive space.
2000100	2007100	128 megabyte DirectX 9C compatible card or NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or ATI equivalent.
2007100	2011100	DirectX 9 compatible sound card, internet connection, keyboard, mouse.
2011100	2013100	Their recommended ones are actually quite a bit better.
2013100	2019100	But, you know, honestly, why?
2019100	2020100	Okay.
2020100	2023100	I guess there's like, you can download minimum content
2023100	2028100	or you can have like the maximum content that's saying you want 2 gigs of hard drive space.
2028100	2031100	I think it's just the minimum requirements versus the maximum.
2031100	2034100	You can either install the entire game off the DVD
2034100	2040100	or you could just run it off the DVD and some of it on the hard drive.
2040100	2042100	Whatever.
2042100	2044100	So, it's kind of interesting though.
2044100	2050100	There's been some stuff leaked out from the German ratings board, the USK.
2050100	2053100	Of course, they had leaked out some stuff a while back
2053100	2058100	including the translation of Catan and Casarone to Xbox Live Arcade.
2058100	2061100	Well, now they have another board game turned Xbox Live Arcade.
2061100	2062100	Did you mean Carcassonne?
2062100	2064100	Carcassonne, whatever.
2064100	2067100	You said it like casserole.
2067100	2069100	Carcassonne.
2069100	2070100	Whatever.
2070100	2072100	I had to, sorry.
2072100	2073100	Yeah.
2073100	2074100	Okay, you finished?
2074100	2075100	I'm done.
2075100	2076100	I promise.
2076100	2081100	Anyways, one of the games that they had on there was Ticket to Ride
2081100	2085100	which, if you've played it, it's a train-themed game.
2085100	2086100	Also pretty fun.
2086100	2091100	Some other games that they've also were revealed on there.
2091100	2097100	Of course, Penny Arcade's games on the rain, Slick Precipice of Darkness.
2097100	2102100	Rugu and Golf, tee it up.
2102100	2106100	And at least, we don't know when they're coming, but at least they're on their way.
2106100	2108100	What are you giggling at?
2108100	2114100	The Rob D in chat says, I'm going to go play that Super Mario goulash game next.
2114100	2115100	Whatever.
2115100	2117100	Chat room's funny.
2117100	2118100	I love chat room.
2118100	2119100	Chat.orangelandradio.com.
2119100	2121100	Yeah, chat's just perfect.
2121100	2124100	I love chat.
2124100	2129100	I also love more Xbox Live Arcade games as long as they don't suck, but hey, it might
2129100	2130100	be kind of cool.
2130100	2137100	Fable 2 is going to be interacting with apparently three different Xbox Live Arcade games.
2137100	2143100	That was recently revealed this week in an interview with the guy behind Fable 2, and
2143100	2147700	money that is won in one of the games can actually be transferred to funds in Fable
2147700	2148700	2.
2148700	2149700	We already knew that.
2149700	2154980	But Carbonated Games has made apparently some casual games, and there's three titles involved.
2154980	2160040	One is called Keystone, one is called Wizard's Tower, and the other one is called Mage Dice.
2160040	2163780	So when you play these games, which involve a little bit of gambling in them, you get
2163780	2167660	Fable Gold in them, and you get to use that Fable Gold in your Fable game.
2167660	2169740	I'm just looking forward to co-op in this game.
2169740	2171660	You know you can't wait for co-op in Fable 2, Loki.
2171660	2176340	Yeah, the only bad thing about Wizard's Tower is it's really just Yaris renamed Wizard's
2176340	2177340	Tower.
2177340	2178340	Shut up, really?
2178340	2179340	No.
2179340	2180340	Oh, I was going to say, that's horrible, if so.
2180340	2185020	I wonder if these are going to be free, because they are kind of like, you know, marketing
2185020	2186020	Fable 2.
2186020	2187020	No.
2187020	2188020	Hopefully they're cheap.
2188020	2189020	They better not be expensive.
2189020	2193300	They're going to whore this game out like a whore.
2193300	2198460	Basically achievements in the game, a Fable by the way, achievement points are going to
2198460	2201540	be tied to the game's morality scale.
2201540	2208060	So basically achievements, you know, would be being pure, pure good and pure, pure bad
2208060	2209060	could be interesting.
2209060	2215300	Well duh, they're going to of course have stuff like that as well as like, I don't know,
2215300	2217580	kill your dog, I don't know.
2217580	2222100	But at the same time, like, the original Fable sounded so freaking awesome and then it was
2222100	2226660	kind of, it was okay, it was okay.
2226660	2230660	But I'm definitely interested in checking this game out, so we'll see.
2230660	2236820	Well, you know, there's another game that I think is, well okay, I'd never played it,
2236820	2240180	but I know a lot of people did, Puzzle Quest.
2240180	2245740	Well, Puzzle Quest, you know, is doing pretty well on Xbox Live Arcade, so there's actually
2245740	2255440	going to be a expansion and they're asking the players to name it for them.
2255440	2263580	Sort of like a, if you actually go onto the contest website, which is at puzzle-quest.com,
2263580	2268580	ooh, actually it's already over.
2268580	2269580	It ended on the 21st.
2269580	2270580	Dang, that went by fast.
2270580	2273520	It wasn't even open when I last checked earlier this week.
2273520	2275260	It ended on the 21st.
2275260	2280700	Well damn, I was going to try to get our chatters to spam them with Puzzle Quest Orange or something.
2280700	2281700	Not really.
2281700	2285420	Well, at any rate, they said that once they've decided the name, then the expansion's going
2285420	2288080	to be out in the spring over Xbox Live.
2288080	2289780	So have fun.
2289780	2292140	But what about all the other places they hoard Puzzle Quest to?
2292140	2293500	They just get shafted, huh?
2293500	2294500	I have no idea.
2294500	2298660	I would have never thought Puzzle Quest was going to get an expansion or any type of microtransactions
2298660	2302220	whatsoever because of the fact it was on the DS and all these other systems.
2302220	2305580	So I'm kind of surprised at this news.
2305580	2307580	So it's just interesting.
2307580	2309820	I don't know how else to explain it.
2309820	2310820	Interesting.
2310820	2311820	I wasn't expecting that.
2311820	2312820	Were you expecting an expansion?
2312820	2313820	I sure wasn't.
2313820	2314820	An expansion?
2314820	2317700	No, because I thought they would just hoard that out in Puzzle Quest II or something like
2317700	2318700	that.
2318700	2324080	But I guess something to kill time until Puzzle Quest Galactics comes out or Galactrix
2324080	2327220	or whatever the fuck they're calling it.
2327220	2328220	The I-can't-believe-it's-not-puzzle-quest?
2328220	2329220	Yes.
2329220	2330220	Gotcha.
2330220	2337180	Alright, so this weekend there's been a whole bunch of drama revolving a supposedly leaked
2337180	2344060	game Sonic Unleashed with tons of screenshots out there available for it.
2344060	2347060	People are wondering is this an actual game that got leaked?
2347060	2349420	Is this an April Fool's joke?
2349420	2350420	Who knows?
2350420	2354900	Well, first it started off, eh, it's probably fake, you know, who knows?
2354900	2358600	But then there's like a hundred some screenshots for this.
2358600	2363580	So I don't know if it is fake, it's one of the most elaborate fakes I've ever seen.
2363580	2370620	But then apparently now there was news that, you know, Sega of Europe said that it is official
2370620	2376300	and that they were going to be announcing it during their May gamer's day and also make
2376300	2379280	an official announcement at E3.
2379280	2386100	But then there are some sort of, you know, kind of wishy-washy stuff going on with that
2386100	2388780	and now it's maybe not real again.
2388780	2393200	I think at this point it's safe to say with the video out there, with the screenshots
2393200	2396220	out there, I would say it's real.
2396220	2399860	I don't see how it can be a fake at this point based off that video because that video is
2399860	2402860	pretty kick-ass which is out there on YouTube somewhere, right?
2402860	2405820	You have to check out the video of this game, it looks like finally they got the right idea
2405820	2406820	with Sonic.
2406820	2410220	It's basically like a Sonic 2.5D as they would call it.
2410220	2413980	It's very much like the traditional Sonic game, looks pretty good.
2413980	2419820	The screenshots that they've been showing were supposedly from an Xbox 360 version.
2419820	2423660	There's some other rumors coming out that the game is going to be on the cover of next
2423660	2430380	month's Play Magazine and also that there's going to be some stuff running the official
2430380	2437960	Nintendo magazine, the UK one, that's going to be, I guess, the cover in August for them.
2437960	2442940	So right now we're speculating that it's coming out for the 360 and probably a version for
2442940	2447220	the Wii and you can probably assume that there's a version for the PS3 if there's one coming
2447220	2449340	out for the 360.
2449340	2452420	ActDeft in chat says, hope for Sonic's future equals rising.
2452420	2458660	I really hope so because the last few Sonic creations in a row minus his appearance in
2458660	2460760	Brawl have all been very disappointing.
2460760	2463580	So God, I hope so.
2463580	2464580	Don't you hope, Jamie?
2464580	2465980	I hope they got it right finally.
2465980	2466980	I can hope.
2466980	2468940	The screenshots are pretty awesome.
2468940	2471300	I watched the movie file, it's pretty sweet.
2471300	2480140	I think, like I said, if it was a hoax, then the hoax game needs to come out, honestly.
2480140	2486780	That is one hell of an elaborate hoax to fake, I don't know how many screenshots of this
2486780	2487780	game.
2487780	2490100	Or even a mapped level.
2490100	2494940	The video followed the level all the way through.
2494940	2499020	It's very unlikely that it would be an April Fool's joke, but hey, you know what, credit
2499020	2504300	to them if it is an April Fool's joke because that's one of the most convincing April Fool's
2504300	2506380	jokes I've ever seen.
2506380	2512140	Another convincing April Fool's joke was the rumor about Wario's Woods coming to WiiWare.
2512140	2516300	Some screenshots came out earlier this week that appeared to show a version of Wario's
2516300	2517300	Woods on the Wii.
2517300	2519020	I'll tell you what, these are damn good screenshots.
2519020	2520020	Look at that.
2520020	2521100	That is pretty convincing.
2521100	2527580	This whole, it has a more 3D-ish look to them and it shows the Wii remote and some little
2527580	2532300	text in Japanese, I would have bought this, but guess what, it was a joke.
2532300	2535740	And some of our listeners may not even know this, you may have just saw the news earlier
2535740	2540360	this week, but yes, it came out Go Nintendo ran a report with a video from the guy who
2540360	2544820	actually created the whole thing and he kind of shows how he did it.
2544820	2548860	It was actually meant to be an April Fool's joke and apparently what happened is that
2548860	2553700	he posted the joke in IRC trying to get some feedback from some of the folks in IRC like,
2553700	2554700	hey, is this believable?
2554700	2559060	Well, some of the folks in IRC like sent it to Joystiq and it got out there a little bit
2559060	2560060	early.
2560060	2561060	Whoops!
2561060	2563500	So, unfortunately, it is fake.
2563500	2566020	Wario's Woods not coming to WiiWare.
2566020	2569580	At least this one, I mean, but then again, you never know what Nintendo might have up
2569580	2570900	their sleeve.
2570900	2576020	It may not look like this, but as far as I'm concerned, whatever artist did these did a
2576020	2580140	pretty darn good job and Nintendo maybe ought to think to talking to this guy.
2580140	2582340	Maybe they ought to cook something like this up.
2582340	2584220	So we'll see.
2584220	2588260	But sadly, no Wario's Woods on WiiWare anytime soon.
2588260	2589860	That's poopy.
2589860	2593260	Unless Nintendo's getting the last laugh, who knows?
2593260	2602420	Well, something that came out in the April issue of UK's official Xbox magazine said
2602420	2609460	that Ikaruga was out now and was getting a 9 out of 10 from the magazine with no actual
2609460	2611020	release date.
2611020	2617020	So you know what?
2617020	2618020	Is this real?
2618020	2621180	Oh, what, another April Fool's joke?
2621180	2622420	Probably.
2622420	2623420	Who knows?
2623420	2624420	Ikaruga?
2624420	2626140	Well, I mean, it came out in the April issue.
2626140	2627980	No, I think that is.
2627980	2634220	It was a piece talking about Ikaruga and usually in the corner it'll say release date, you
2634220	2638860	know, March or whatever, and it says release out now because it's the April issue.
2638860	2639860	So this hasn't...
2639860	2640940	Well, the game is coming.
2640940	2642540	We've had a story on this before, yeah.
2642540	2643540	The game is coming.
2643540	2644540	That's not...
2644540	2647540	Just for a moment when you were talking about April Fool's Day, I was like, wait, they better
2647540	2648980	not be taunting me with Ikaruga.
2648980	2650620	God, I hate April Fool's Day.
2650620	2651620	I know.
2651620	2653580	I mean, seriously, it's going to be like this for the next two weeks.
2653580	2655780	Well, they did have it out at the Tokyo Game Show.
2655780	2658500	I just wasn't thinking that it was out quite yet.
2658500	2665460	But Ikaruga is like one of the best shooter games ever, so that's really cool.
2665460	2666460	And it's Treasure.
2666460	2671460	GS68 in chat says, game publications should be banned from making April issues anymore.
2671460	2673660	I kind of agree.
2673660	2674660	I kind of agree.
2674660	2675660	Maybe it's just me.
2675660	2680720	Well, if I were a game publication, I would just flat out, you know, post a little editorial
2680720	2687560	in my magazine saying, while certain other magazines and, you know, publications may
2687560	2692780	want to, you know, joke about April Fool's and stuff like that, I would just say, you
2692780	2697900	know, we don't do that, and we figure that you would appreciate more accurate coverage
2697900	2702740	than something that may confuse you, I don't know.
2702740	2707260	Which is, you know, I think the kind of stance we take on this show, you know.
2707260	2708260	April Fool's is...
2708260	2709260	Usually our jokes are pretty obvious.
2709260	2710260	Yeah.
2710260	2712780	And I don't think we're going to do one this year now in light of the other news that came
2712780	2714200	out, so we'll see.
2714200	2722280	The joke is we're going to stay on Live 365.
2722280	2724740	So moving on with more news then, Loki.
2724740	2731940	Well, we don't like to talk about him too much, but there was a brand new story this
2731940	2738240	week about our friend Jackie Poo, or Voldemort, as you may know him.
2738240	2748620	The Florida Supreme Court has sent an official notice to Jack Thompson that he now must have
2748620	2754700	an attorney to basically approve any further cases he has.
2754700	2759300	The court's ruling is basically saying that the numerous abuses that Thompson had made,
2759300	2763740	including submitting pornography and stuff like that, is a relentless and frivolous pursuit
2763740	2769220	for vindication of his claim that he is being victimized by the Florida Bar, and the continued
2769220	2774300	ability to maintain the minimum standard of decorum and respect for the judicial system
2774300	2779100	in which the litigants, and especially the attorneys, must adhere, because of this basically
2779100	2787740	the motion has been made that for any lawsuit that he is now putting forward, it must be
2787740	2793460	signed off by, I guess, an accredited attorney or something like that.
2793460	2796220	In other words, he needs a babysitter.
2796220	2797220	Yes.
2797220	2800180	So it's interesting.
2800180	2802060	I don't know.
2802060	2805960	Hopefully we'll see a lot less of him unless he gets some other retarded person to kind
2805960	2812620	of help him along and kind of join forces with him.
2812620	2816460	I think it's about damn time.
2816460	2823340	To Lord Voldemort from your friends at Orange Lounge Radio, you probably couldn't hear that
2823340	2824340	again.
2824340	2825340	Let's try this one instead.
2825340	2826340	Hold on.
2826340	2827340	That's wonderful.
2827340	2835940	No, and here's the best part about the whole thing.
2835940	2843140	After this ruling came down, apparently Thompson sent out an email describing the Supreme Court's
2843140	2851940	order as both good news and idiotic, because he's got them right where he wants them now.
2851940	2858700	Does he live on another planet?
2858700	2864060	Speaking of crazy stuff, there's that new Street Fighter movie coming out, Street Fighter
2864060	2867780	The Legend of Chun-Li, and it's getting a more full cast.
2867780	2869100	Chris Klein is in it.
2869100	2872260	He plays Guile's friend, which apparently is a big role.
2872260	2873260	I don't know.
2873260	2874260	Charlie.
2874260	2875260	Right.
2875260	2876260	Charlie Nash.
2876260	2886580	Kristen Kreuk, who is the Lois Lane on Smallville.
2886580	2887580	She's playing...
2887580	2890020	No, I guess it would be Lana Lane, because it was a daughter, right?
2890020	2891020	I don't know.
2891020	2892020	I don't watch Smallville.
2892020	2893020	That's her.
2893020	2894020	Whatever.
2894020	2895020	She's going to be Chun-Li.
2895020	2896940	I bet half the guys who watch her don't even know what her name is.
2896940	2898000	They just watch her.
2898000	2902460	She's going to be Chun-Li, and Michael Clarke Duncan is going to be Balrog.
2902460	2903460	Get this.
2903460	2907460	Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas is going to be Vega.
2907460	2909540	He's the guy with the long hair and the black eyed peas.
2909540	2910900	He's going to be Vega.
2910900	2912780	That's going to be interesting.
2912780	2916460	Neil McDonough is going to be M. Bison.
2916460	2921100	And I've never really heard that name, but then when I see his picture, I'm like, okay,
2921100	2922100	that guy.
2922100	2925040	I think I've seen him before, somewhere.
2925040	2929580	And I agree with SSJ100Matt in chat who says, this movie fails for one reason.
2929580	2930580	No Kylie.
2930580	2932060	And I kind of agree.
2932060	2935980	Oh, this guy was in Star Trek First Contact.
2935980	2936980	That's why he looks familiar.
2936980	2938340	Minority Report.
2938340	2939340	Band of Brothers.
2939340	2940340	Okay.
2940340	2941340	He's been hand fulfilled.
2941340	2943300	You know why this movie also fails?
2943300	2944300	Uh oh.
2944300	2945300	Why?
2945300	2949780	Because it's a Street Fighter movie and anybody that thinks of Street Fighter the movie is
2949780	2954580	always going to think of the last horrible Street Fighter movie.
2954580	2957220	Okay, I just killed...
2957220	2958220	I just...
2958220	2959220	Horrell Julia.
2959220	2963900	I just realized why this guy looks so familiar to me, but I almost don't want to say why.
2963900	2972160	And it's because of one of the movies he was recently in was the last movie I saw on DVD.
2972160	2974660	It was I Know Who Killed Me.
2974660	2978300	I actually watched that on DVD and he was in it.
2978300	2979300	Because I have to see...
2979300	2984560	Okay, when a film wins the award for worst movie of the year, I have to see just how
2984560	2985860	bad it is.
2985860	2986860	And it was pretty bad.
2986860	2987860	No you don't.
2987860	2990660	I'm going to give you fair warning that it sucks.
2990660	2991660	So why do you...
2991660	2992660	I like that movie.
2992660	2993660	I love Showgirls.
2993660	2996080	Showgirls is one of my favorite movies of all time, but it's one of those things where
2996080	2997900	it's so bad it's good.
2997900	2998900	Get it?
2998900	3002980	Like, we actually had a discussion about this at our friend's house the other day.
3002980	3006460	And the movie actually came up as Caveman.
3006460	3007460	Have you seen that movie?
3007460	3008460	No.
3008460	3012380	It was really, really not a good movie and it was one of the 70s and the dinosaurs in
3012380	3013380	it were all claymation.
3013380	3014380	Nice.
3014380	3018060	But it was so awful that it's a great movie.
3018060	3019860	Nice.
3019860	3021660	I've seen Teenage Caveman.
3021660	3025260	That was like Mystery Science Theater 3000.
3025260	3027180	Manos, The Hands of Fate.
3027180	3031140	Alright, can we please move on?
3031140	3032780	Yeah.
3032780	3035260	I have some stuff.
3035260	3043280	So I don't know how I feel about this because, you know, again with all of the movies coming
3043280	3051620	out from, you know, video games, and especially since the horrible, horrible Ooey bowl is
3051620	3060540	associated with this one, The Name of the King, A Dungeon Siege Tale is going to be
3060540	3062340	out on April 15th.
3062340	3065580	You know, I knew this like a long time ago and I wish I had thought about this, but I
3065580	3069260	figured it was an Ooey bowl movie and no one really cares.
3069260	3077060	It will have deleted scenes, behind the scenes featurette, and trailers.
3077060	3086180	And the suggested retail is $27.98, so look for it in the $5 bin at Walmart in a few weeks
3086180	3087180	after that.
3087180	3092220	Has anyone, I don't know if anyone else saw the news this week.
3092220	3099460	They're running a website for Postal, the movie, because it's launching the same weekend
3099460	3109660	as Indiana Jones, and they have Vern Troyer dressed up like Indy and it was like, I don't
3109660	3115980	remember what the phrase was, it was something stupid like, you know, I have a message for
3115980	3120720	Indy fuck you, or like fuck you up or something like that, I don't know.
3120720	3126300	But they literally, I think, I'm sure it's supposed to be parody, but half of me still
3126300	3130180	thinks that they literally think that they're going to beat Indiana Jones in the box office
3130180	3131180	somehow.
3131180	3132180	Delusional.
3132180	3133180	Exactly.
3133180	3140180	You know what's going to happen when they go back to work Monday morning after that
3140180	3142940	weekend?
3142940	3146900	Vern Troyer is going to go drink some more.
3146900	3153620	No, he's about as delusional as Jack Thompson.
3153620	3157500	It's basically just going to be, you know, he's going to think it's a great victory for
3157500	3162180	him and that, you know, it may make him the most money out of any of his movies or some
3162180	3167300	shit like that, and he'll have renewed hope for making more video game movies or something.
3167300	3168300	I don't know.
3168300	3169740	I kind of miss when this show had a soundboard.
3169740	3174580	I think in our post-live 365 era, we need to bring back the soundboard.
3174580	3176580	I kind of miss having one.
3176580	3177580	Yeah.
3177580	3178580	Okay.
3178580	3179580	Sorry.
3179580	3187280	So, Call of Duty 4, a very successful game, they are going to be getting a brand new Game
3187280	3194100	of the Year edition, which is going to be coming out in April, actually April 3rd for
3194100	3196780	the Xbox 360 version.
3196780	3201740	Along with that, there will be a brand new map pack that's going to have a few different
3201740	3208820	maps of Creek, Broadcast, Chinatown, and Kill House, that's going to be available for $10,
3208820	3212980	and as you might guess, in the Game of the Year edition, you get a token to download
3212980	3217020	that for free, so if you haven't bought the game yet and are thinking about it, you may
3217020	3218940	wait for this one to come out.
3218940	3225100	It should be noted, though, that for some reason whatsoever, the PlayStation 3 version's
3225100	3229180	coming out a few weeks after the Xbox 360 one.
3229180	3236180	I don't get that, but that's going on, so hooray.
3236180	3238100	Hooray?
3238100	3241580	I guess.
3241580	3246420	Also hooray for this, I like the store Target, and Target is apparently getting into gaming
3246420	3248180	in a way you may not have guessed.
3248180	3251620	They are selling indie gaming shirts.
3251620	3257060	They're selling shirts from independent games like Tower of Goo and some other games that
3257060	3260820	are there, and the shirts only cost you $12, here's the best part, buy the shirt, get the
3260820	3262020	game with it.
3262020	3264460	They actually have the game, like I can see in this little picture, the game's actually
3264460	3269240	kind of hanging around the collar of the shirt, so you can get both for $12.
3269240	3270240	That's cool.
3270240	3271240	That's kind of a neat little concept.
3271240	3272240	That is really cool.
3272240	3274980	That is strange to see at Target, though, of all places.
3274980	3278260	I would not have expected this to be at Target.
3278260	3280580	EGP Apparel.
3280580	3283460	I would expect to see that maybe at GameStop or something.
3283460	3289260	Yeah, or some other type of nerd store like Hot Topic, it's kind of nerdy, right?
3289260	3293140	EGPapparel.com if you want to see more about that.
3293140	3294900	Buy the shirt and get the game for free.
3294900	3295900	That's cool.
3295900	3297260	That's very interesting.
3297260	3298540	Tower of Goo sounds funny.
3298540	3301180	MacMan in chat says Target and Kmart.
3301180	3304840	Tower of Goo is coming to the WiiWare also.
3304840	3305840	You know what I didn't realize?
3305840	3311460	I did not realize until just last week that Defend Your Castle game that's coming to the
3311460	3312460	Wii.
3312460	3315460	I did not realize that it's based off the old Flash game where you throw the guys up
3315460	3320460	in the air and watch them explode into millions of pieces, because I saw the preview for that
3320460	3325860	somewhere earlier this week, and when I watched it, I'm like, oh, shit, that game.
3325860	3329100	That would be hella fun in multiplayer mode.
3329100	3330100	That Defend Your Castle game.
3330100	3332340	Especially when you're drunk and you're just like, ah.
3332340	3333340	That game is fun.
3333340	3336100	What's the site that you can play that game for free on?
3336100	3341060	I don't know, but they had it linked, I know, on the Joystick story for that when they were
3341060	3342860	talking about.
3342860	3345620	But I'm sure if you type in Defend Your Castle, you probably can find it.
3345620	3350180	XGenStudios.com slash play slash castle.
3350180	3352780	That game is so much fun, even though it's like years old.
3352780	3354700	I think it's been on the internet for like three years.
3354700	3359260	Let me post that in chat there so our lovely chatters can take a look at that game.
3359260	3362260	But don't get too distracted, because it's time for us to open up the Skype line.
3362260	3363260	That's right.
3363260	3365920	It's the part of the show where we let you guys interact with us if you want to give
3365920	3369100	us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3369100	3371740	Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3371740	3375300	This is the part of the show where you can do that and interact with us, and we'll be
3375300	3381780	taking calls I'd say right about right now, at least when they start coming in.
3381780	3386740	So in the meantime, we ought to go to Loki for some last-minute stories, yes, Loki?
3386740	3387740	Yes.
3387740	3391800	Okay, so to start things off, let's see.
3391800	3396320	We've got some kind of terrible news, actually.
3396320	3400500	There's rumors that the latest Wii update blocks the freeloader from working.
3400500	3401500	Yes, that's right.
3401500	3408920	The brand new freeloader that apparently was supposed to be unfazed by Wii updates, apparently
3408920	3410460	that's been broken.
3410460	3415380	Although we're getting mixed, or I should say Go Nintendo has been getting mixed emails
3415380	3416380	about it.
3416380	3418260	Some people are saying that it is not working.
3418260	3421060	Some people are saying it is still working.
3421060	3427620	But the real update that was supposed to be for that is it's actually supposed to be defeating
3427620	3431180	a different homebrew kind of hack thing that they had going on.
3431180	3434700	I told you it would take like 15 seconds for Nintendo to patch that show.
3434700	3439140	No, it's not the one you're thinking, too, it's this thing called a Trecha Assigner.
3439140	3444460	It basically allows them to create, because all the files on Wii discs are encrypted,
3444460	3448900	so this will allow you to create the key and basically put your own files, make your own
3448900	3451260	homebrew discs for the Wii, basically.
3451260	3452260	Let's go to the phones.
3452260	3453260	I've got somebody on hold.
3453260	3454260	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3454260	3455260	Who's this?
3455260	3456260	Yeah, what's up?
3456260	3457260	This is RossDioUT.
3457260	3458260	Hello.
3458260	3459260	Wow.
3459260	3460260	You're really good at getting through first.
3460260	3461260	You're like the new Raven's Dolphin.
3461260	3462660	Whatever happened to Raven's Dolphin?
3462660	3466700	Did he abandon our show?
3466700	3469140	Raven's Dolphin, where are you?
3469140	3470140	I miss you.
3470140	3471140	Okay, I'm sorry.
3471140	3472140	RossDioUT, you're cool, too.
3472140	3473140	What's up?
3473140	3474140	Okay.
3474140	3479180	First off, I'm surprised you didn't mention this early on in the show when you were talking
3479180	3487140	about the Gibson lawsuit bonanza, but here's a link that talks about the patent.
3487140	3491660	I'm going to put it in the chat right now.
3491660	3500180	Basically what's happening is that the diagram that goes with the patent shows a stereoscopic
3500180	3510580	headset, an eight-channel mixer, a FEX processor, among other crazy-ass shit, and an actual
3510580	3511580	musical instrument.
3511580	3515060	I don't know if you can see the picture from that link.
3515060	3516940	Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
3516940	3521380	Yeah, I didn't want to spend too much time on that whole Gibson lawsuit because I think
3521380	3522380	it's retarded.
3522380	3524180	I was going to get to that actually in a few seconds.
3524180	3525620	What do you want to say then, Libby?
3525620	3528940	Well, basically here's what Harmonix's response to the Gibson lawsuit was.
3528940	3534780	This lawsuit is completely without merit and we intend to defend it vigorously.
3534780	3539300	Gibson's patent filed nearly 10 years ago required a 3D display, a real musical instrument,
3539300	3541780	and a recording of a concert.
3541780	3544460	Rock band and guitar hero are completely different.
3544460	3549400	Among other things, they are games, require no headset, and use a controller only shaped
3549400	3550400	like a real instrument.
3550400	3554900	It's unfortunate Gibson unfairly desires to share the tremendous success enjoyed by the
3554900	3557260	developers of rock band and guitar hero.
3557260	3560820	Yeah, looking at this little picture of the guitar, I mean, I know pictures and patents
3560820	3565100	aren't supposed to be the end all be all because we've seen others throughout the years, but
3565100	3567820	this looks nothing like the game controller that they're using.
3567820	3569820	It looks like a MIDI guitar.
3569820	3578340	Yeah, I mean, it looks so far removed from guitar hero and rock band, I don't even see
3578340	3579860	where Gibson's coming from.
3579860	3587220	They're not going to win this, that's for sure, because it's not even close.
3587220	3591860	Not even, not even, and I'm shocked seeing it that they'd even bother.
3591860	3594700	But then again, we've seen more stupid lawsuits before.
3594700	3599700	Oh yes, there was one other thing.
3599700	3605660	Rainbow Six Vegas 2 came out last week, and if anybody's listening is thinking about getting
3605660	3609820	it, I would stay away from the PS3 one if you're interested in online, because the online
3609820	3610820	is broken.
3610820	3615220	Oh great, what's broken about it?
3615220	3625460	Well, I'm finding myself unable to get into most games, and the few games that I can get
3625460	3629260	into, I get booted off right away, and it's not just me.
3629260	3633140	In those few games, I've talked to the people there and they're having the same problem.
3633140	3637020	I know it's not me because I'm not having the problem with Vegas 1, I'm not having a
3637020	3642360	problem with a lot of the other PS3 games, Call of Duty 4 and stuff, but I was actually
3642360	3649820	rather shocked, especially since the game had a release day patch.
3649820	3652420	Don't worry, a patch will fix it.
3652420	3658300	That seems to be the thinking of video games in this day and age.
3658300	3662980	The patch that came out when the game came out, I'm serious, I pre-ordered the game,
3662980	3665520	I got it first day, right?
3665520	3671580	And I go home, literally, immediately, PlayStation Network's like, yeah, we got a patch, download
3671580	3673380	it, and I was like, alright.
3673380	3676940	I figured it was a multiplayer patch, but apparently not.
3676940	3680140	Patches should be for what Rock Band just did.
3680140	3683780	It added a whole new feature to the thing that maybe should have been there in the first
3683780	3687780	place, but oh well, it was a new feature, something new and neat.
3687780	3689820	That is an acceptable patch to me.
3689820	3694640	An unacceptable patch to me is, oh, I don't know, Bully?
3694640	3696020	Or countless others?
3696020	3697740	Yeah, that's another one.
3697740	3704860	Another thing is, this isn't the first time we've seen an Ubisoft game with a patch to
3704860	3707900	fix things that were either broken or they were too lazy to get in.
3707900	3713260	I don't know if you guys remember Naruto, Rise of a Ninja?
3713260	3716580	Like a week after the game came out, they came out with a Japanese language patch.
3716580	3720280	It is literally 52 megs.
3720280	3722220	They're basically unlocking it off the disk.
3722220	3725220	It's just ridiculous.
3725220	3727900	I don't know, 52 megs doesn't sound like a key.
3727900	3729180	Usually a key is pretty small.
3729180	3733980	52 megs, that sounds like actual dialogue to me.
3733980	3735340	There's no possible way.
3735340	3740780	It's all the voices in the town and the cutscenes.
3740780	3743260	There's a lot more than 52 megs worth of dialogue going on there.
3743260	3744260	It's all voices.
3744260	3751660	I don't know how that could be all the dialogue.
3751660	3756660	It's just too much.
3756660	3761240	We don't see it as much as we did when the 360 came out.
3761240	3764500	I think companies are getting better about it.
3764500	3772900	But we're still seeing this sort of, ah, fuck it, rush it out, we'll patch it attitude.
3772900	3779380	It's going to start hurting companies, especially with these consoles getting more popular because
3779380	3781820	you know the majority of them aren't going to be online.
3781820	3787900	It's just a numbers game.
3787900	3791380	I really feel sorry for the people who are going to get stuck with unpatched versions,
3791380	3795500	especially with what Rob mentioned, Bully.
3795500	3796500	That's going to suck.
3796500	3800980	Well, Ross, we've got to wrap up so you can go, but any other quick thoughts you want
3800980	3802980	to get out there?
3802980	3806300	Actually, no.
3806300	3813820	I mean, that's pretty much it, except for the whole Ubisoft buying Tom Clancy thing.
3813820	3818620	The only thing I was surprised was that they hadn't already done it.
3818620	3822620	I would have thought that was already a relationship that was, but there you have it.
3822620	3825380	All right, Ross, have a good one, buddy.
3825380	3826380	You too, Sam.
3826380	3827380	Bye bye.
3827380	3831260	All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,
3831260	3835140	Orange Lounge Radio.
3835140	3840420	Any other stories you want to share with us, Loki, while we're waiting?
3840420	3841420	Sure.
3841420	3842980	There's apparently some pretty cool mods.
3842980	3843980	Oh, never mind.
3843980	3844980	We've got to call.
3844980	3845980	Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.
3845980	3846980	Who's this?
3846980	3847980	Hey, what's up?
3847980	3848980	It's the RobD guys.
3848980	3849980	Well, hello.
3849980	3850980	Long time, no talk.
3850980	3851980	RobD.
3851980	3852980	Hi.
3852980	3853980	How are you?
3853980	3854980	Yeah, yeah.
3854980	3858180	I've kind of been working and all that fun stuff.
3858180	3861780	I work most Sundays and I close, so that kind of disables me from actually listening to
3861780	3862780	you guys.
3862780	3863780	Work?
3863780	3866420	What is this work thing you speak of?
3866420	3869820	Yeah, I know.
3869820	3872860	I need to actually abandon my job and only play games for a living.
3872860	3873860	Exactly.
3873860	3874860	See how that one goes for a little while.
3874860	3875860	Exactly.
3875860	3876860	All right.
3876860	3877860	Well, what's on your mind tonight, Rob?
3877860	3883300	Well, I've got to say, actually, just listening to Ross steal UTT's call, now that Ubisoft
3883300	3888020	actually owns a Tom Clancy license, we're going to see Tom Clancy's, I don't know,
3888020	3893260	Tom Clancy's Nautilus or Rise of a Ninja or Tom Clancy's Enchanted Arms now that they
3893260	3894700	actually own the property.
3894700	3900860	I somehow doubt that would happen, but usually, that's kind of like the same thing with
3900860	3905600	the whole, when Activision bought Blizzard or whatever, the whole World of Warcraft will
3905600	3907500	come to Guitar Hero tomorrow.
3907500	3915460	That'd be great, but I got to say, the reason I called in is I don't really have a topic
3915460	3919740	to discuss, but I need to just express my joy as a fighting game fan of just the titles
3919740	3923340	coming out this year, because you've got King of Fighters XII, you've got Super Smash
3923340	3928080	Brothers Brawl, Street Fighter IV, Super Street Fighter II HD Remix, Soul Calibur IV.
3928080	3930540	I can't remember a crop of fighting games, well, at least-
3930540	3931540	Tekken 6?
3931540	3935780	At the very least, with this pedigree, yeah, exactly, with this pedigree for a very long
3935780	3936780	time.
3936780	3939220	We'll see if all these games end up panning out to be good.
3939220	3943500	That obviously remains to be seen, but as a fighting game fan, I just haven't been
3943500	3948100	this excited for games, especially to see some of these franchises go multiplayer, well,
3948100	3950420	with online multiplayer for the very first time.
3950420	3955220	Hopefully we'll see that out of several franchises this year, especially good multiplayer out
3955220	3956220	of Street Fighter.
3956220	3957220	That'd be-
3957220	3958220	That's a good point.
3958220	3961500	I can't think of a year that has been quite as big for fighting games as this year is
3961500	3962500	shaping up to be.
3962500	3965220	I haven't really had it put in perspective for me like that, but yeah, that's a lot
3965220	3967380	of big-ass franchises all coming back.
3967380	3971180	I think the only big franchise I can think of that's missing is Mortal Kombat, and
3971180	3976620	most would say that franchise peaked quite some time ago, so whatever, but that's
3976620	3977620	kind of interesting.
3977620	3980860	I still gave some screenshots for the other day for King of Fighters XII, and it looks
3980860	3982900	pretty hot, I got to say.
3982900	3983900	Not that I've been-
3983900	3987260	Yeah, they read you all the animations for all that, so I'm looking forward to seeing
3987260	3988820	how they'll actually turn out.
3988820	3994980	Trucker Terry's back, so for all the Terry Bogard, Engrish, hey, come on, come on, fans,
3994980	3996940	that should make many of them pleased.
3996940	3997940	Nice.
3997940	4001880	Speaking of old school fighting games from SNK, you know how your pick, your classic
4001880	4004820	game of the week last week was The Last Blade.
4004820	4008700	They have it on GameTap 1 and 2, so I went and played it for a little bit, just because
4008700	4010300	I had never really played it before.
4010300	4014260	It's fun, although I was using a keyboard, and fighting games with keyboards are always
4014260	4015260	kind of wonky.
4015260	4018060	You've got to really use a joystick, but eh, I had fun while I was playing.
4018060	4020620	I think it's a really stylish game.
4020620	4022340	Yeah, it's definitely stylish.
4022340	4023820	I couldn't figure out any of the fatalities, though.
4023820	4027180	That was the part I was looking forward to doing, but anyway, sorry, I didn't mean
4027180	4031540	to derail, but what do you think about the whole Street Fighter IV?
4031540	4035820	Do you think it's shaping up to be pretty awesome, or is it just like Street Fighter
4035820	4039700	II ten years later, or what do you think?
4039700	4042580	Well it's nice to see that they're actually modernizing the look, and I think this is
4042580	4047580	an important step for the franchise, that they're moving finally from sprites to, you
4047580	4052140	know, some modern graphics that aren't done by, what was that company that did Street
4052140	4053260	Fighter EX?
4053260	4055060	I think Akira or something like that?
4055060	4056060	I don't even remember, frankly.
4056060	4063060	To me, it all depends on how the game plays, you can't really determine until the game
4063060	4064060	actually comes out.
4064060	4068020	I think it's going to be disappointing if the game doesn't really come out with anything
4068020	4072140	particularly new in the fighting game engine, especially since SNK has been changing up
4072140	4076620	their fighting game engine practically every year, and with King of Fighters XI, they really
4076620	4080580	broke out, pulled out all the stops with the super cancels, well not the super cancels,
4080580	4086340	because that's been there for a while, but the dream cancels, the saving shifts, a lot
4086340	4092980	of things that actually changed the gameplay, and just really helped it out as a franchise.
4092980	4096860	I'd really like to see how the game plays, and considering I really doubt that it'll
4096860	4099980	actually make any kind of a splash in American arcades, we'll probably have to wait until
4099980	4103140	it comes out whenever it does.
4103140	4108940	Do you think American arcades can be saved, Rob?
4108940	4115100	Probably not, not with how online play has been just proliferated over here, and in Japan
4115100	4120300	I don't think that's really as much of a concern, since they're not really into shooters
4120300	4125340	as much as we are certainly, and they haven't had Xbox Live, or at least they don't support
4125340	4131380	Xbox Live as much as we do, I really doubt you can get gamers that gathered again.
4131380	4136180	So sad, because it was just not even, you can count how long ago it was when arcades
4136180	4141020	were still, they might have been getting closer on its last legs, but this show started due
4141020	4145860	to hanging out in an arcade, so this is kind of sad.
4145860	4150300	I have fond memories of playing Neo Geo games and playing the old X in an arcade game, Turtles
4150300	4153260	in Time especially was a favorite of mine, oh god.
4153260	4156700	You can still play Neo Geo arcade, like they have a Neo Geo arcade machine at Jim Boy's
4156700	4158700	Tacos, have you seen that?
4158700	4159700	I don't eat at Jim Boy's.
4159700	4164580	Oh, but well, okay, well, they have one there, it might be worth looking at.
4164580	4168220	There's a bajillion Jim Boys around too, I don't know which one you mean.
4168220	4173380	It's the one over on Folsom and Sunrise, I know that makes no sense to our other listeners,
4173380	4174380	but anyway.
4174380	4180940	Well, I used to go to Rico's Pizza, and play the DDR there while I was eating pizza, and
4180940	4183140	18 Wheeler Pro Trekker.
4183140	4188740	Yeah, remember when pizza parlors had hella arcade games in them, like it was like pizza
4188740	4192620	slash arcade, and now you're lucky to go to a round table and see like two games and a
4192620	4193980	pinball table, that's it.
4193980	4194980	You're lucky to see that.
4194980	4198220	Well, we were just talking about, just for the pinball aspect, we were talking, because
4198220	4202380	I'm sure everyone by now knows that, you know, my husband and I collect pinball machines,
4202380	4207580	no tables, but we were just talking about how you used to be able to go anywhere and
4207580	4213080	there would always be a pinball, and some sort of classic game, and whatever was not
4213080	4219140	exactly new new, but was new about three months ago, they're waiting, you know.
4219140	4224100	And now it's like, no, we have crane games, sorry.
4224100	4225100	That's sad.
4225100	4230100	Yeah, the pizza parlor was where I first played Street Fighter II, so, and I actually, the
4230100	4234580	first character I ever played as was Dalsim, or as my mom called him, Mr. Stretchy Arms,
4234580	4240300	so I've always kind of had a soft spot in my heart for pizza parlor arcade games.
4240300	4243580	My first Street Fighter II was at a 7-11.
4243580	4247620	My first Street Fighter II was at a college arcade.
4247620	4252060	My college arcade, I can still remember the lineup for the longest time.
4252060	4258940	We had Cyber, not, what am I thinking of, I can't remember, Cyberstorm was it?
4258940	4266420	It was like, it was sort of like a virtual on ripoff, sort of, and we had A Killer Instinct,
4266420	4272740	we had World Cup Soccer 94, which became my favorite table and I own one now, we had Dark
4272740	4280540	Stalkers, we had KOF 94, and a bunch of other machines that I usually ignored.
4280540	4286340	SSJ100Matt says, yeah, I remember when 7-11s had arcade games here, and I was gonna say,
4286340	4290020	it wasn't a 7-11, but the same type of thing, a little convenience store chain was one of
4290020	4292140	the first places I played Mortal Kombat II.
4292140	4299220	Well, 7-11 actually went out of business in Alabama a long time ago, I was really surprised
4299220	4303420	when it moved out here and saw 7-11s, but I would go to any one of them and there would
4303420	4306660	always be some sort of game, whether it worked or not was another story, but there would
4306660	4309380	be a game there, so it was weird.
4309380	4312740	Now you can find good arcade machines though at truck stops.
4312740	4314700	I found Derby Owners Club at a truck stop.
4314700	4315700	Good times.
4315700	4319380	Alright, well, Rob D., we've been on the phone a while now, so I gotta ask you so we can
4319380	4322780	get some more calls, any last thoughts, any other things you wanna say?
4322780	4323780	Uh...
4323780	4324780	Pawa Dunk!
4324780	4326780	I'll just send it there.
4326780	4327780	Alright, have a good one, Rob.
4327780	4328780	See you guys later.
4328780	4329780	Bye.
4329780	4330780	Bye.
4330780	4333620	I guess he was getting some bad echo on the line, I don't know how that happened, happened,
4333620	4335620	happened, happened, no just kidding.
4335620	4341180	Alright, you can give us a call if you want, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4341180	4344300	Loki, what was that story you were gonna read for us earlier?
4344300	4349580	Uh, well apparently there's some really cool mods, character mods you can have for the
4349580	4354020	PlayStation 3 version, or actually the PC version also of Unreal Tournament 3, including
4354020	4355660	Master Chief.
4355660	4358740	They also have the guy from Crysis.
4358740	4365500	There's also, of course, Marcus Fenix, and Cloud, and Spawn.
4365500	4372580	And actually the one for Halo, I gotta say, looks better than the Xbox 360 version.
4372580	4373580	Let's go to the phones.
4373580	4374580	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
4374580	4375580	Who's this?
4375580	4376580	Oh, sweet Jesus.
4376580	4377580	I finally got in.
4377580	4378580	It's DJ Dark Knight.
4378580	4379580	Hi, DJ Dark Knight.
4379580	4380580	What's on your mind?
4380580	4381580	Uh, not much.
4381580	4386180	I was surprised you guys didn't talk about Guitar Hero DS.
4386180	4387180	We did.
4387180	4389740	You might have arrived late to the show, it was early in Part A.
4389740	4396660	Well, I remember I saw Peripheral about it, and all I could think of is, ugh, major cramps
4396660	4399060	for that game, I swear.
4399060	4400060	I don't think so.
4400060	4401060	I don't know.
4401060	4406800	Cause it's gonna be just like you're holding the guitar usually, but I think it'd be very
4406800	4409860	comfortable actually, cause the keys are sideways.
4409860	4414420	It's not like on top, that would cramp your hands, but your hand actually slides through
4414420	4418860	like a little velcro holder thing, and it still looks like a carpal tunnel nightmare
4418860	4419860	to me.
4419860	4420860	I don't know.
4420860	4421860	Yeah.
4421860	4424460	Yeah, I mean, it'll probably, like I said, it'll probably work out, but it doesn't mean,
4424460	4428500	I know in my case, the way my hands are, I know it's not gonna work too well for me.
4428500	4432980	Um, I was thinking about something else that totally slipped my mind, cause that was the
4432980	4434980	main thing I wanted to talk about.
4434980	4438740	Um, something about the live 365 thing, that does suck.
4438740	4440700	That does suck major balls, I know.
4440700	4444300	It sucks and it's nice, like, you know, I'm hearing from people who are offering to
4444300	4449140	help pay for the increased fees and all that, which I think is really nice, but at the same
4449140	4452580	time you have to, I just want everybody to understand part of the reason that we're leaving
4452580	4458420	is because we disagree with the rate increase of such significance, and the fact that maybe
4458420	4462580	it's just time for the station to have a kick in the butt and, uh, you know, try something
4462580	4463580	a little different.
4463580	4467380	You know, we've been doing it the same way for five and a half years, so we're just trying
4467380	4470980	to see the positives and what is kind of otherwise a depressing thing, and I know it's really
4470980	4475300	going to suck because it displaces, um, our weeknight shows, at least for right now.
4475300	4480460	I mean, we're hoping we can take them with us wherever we end up, but, uh, you know,
4480460	4484740	it's going to be some growing pains, but I'm hoping in the long run it actually ends up
4484740	4485740	as a good thing.
4485740	4491220	Well, I gotta say, if you ever need a spot for Shoutcast, we got lines open.
4491220	4495660	I appreciate it, you know, and I know a lot of people are saying Shoutcast and it's definitely
4495660	4500380	a possibility, uh, we have ideas and we'll see what happens.
4500380	4503860	The other thing about Shoutcast, too, is you got to pay for music licensing if we were
4503860	4506940	going to do something like that, so.
4506940	4509700	But then, you know, all the video game music, I mean, we just, I mean, I think no matter
4509700	4513500	what happens, unfortunately, we're going to have to get rid of our licensed music in,
4513500	4519020	in terms of the cage match that we do every week and the, uh, you know, any shows we had
4519020	4523540	where we were playing a lot of licensed music, like unfortunately Jamie's old show, uh, Matt's
4523540	4525060	mix show, you know, things like that.
4525060	4526060	Hell, my show when I play that.
4526060	4528620	Oh darn, we'll have to get rid of that show that we got rid of, like, a year ago.
4528620	4531860	Well, you know what I mean, but you talked about bringing it back, too, and, you know,
4531860	4535220	it's just, uh, not gonna, it can't happen now, so.
4535220	4536220	We'll see what happens.
4536220	4537220	We don't know.
4537220	4540540	We can always resurrect that My Name Is God-O mix.
4540540	4543180	But I don't know, when it comes to video game music, it feels differently to me.
4543180	4545380	I don't think, you know, it seems like a different realm.
4545380	4548100	I, I would, I would go underground with video game music.
4548100	4549100	I think we'd be okay.
4549100	4550100	Yeah.
4550100	4552820	Yeah, um, like I said, good luck on that one.
4552820	4553820	Um.
4553820	4554820	Thank you.
4554820	4557780	Like I said, other than that, though, um, of course, me being the fancy star of Universe
4557780	4561420	Fanatic, uh, finally back on the game and whatnot, it's officially White Day in the
4561420	4562420	game and whatnot.
4562420	4567260	I keep meaning to sign on and just kind of, like, play around in Fantasy Star Universe
4567260	4572740	and see if I, I don't know, like it again, um, but I keep, just keep getting sidetracked,
4572740	4574140	stupid wow and stuff like that.
4574140	4577740	Well, like Gary said, you can't really enjoy it unless you get the expansion, of course.
4577740	4582220	Once you get the expansion, then yeah, you can do, enjoy the newer stuff, but I mean,
4582220	4586500	if you still just have the basic ones, you're still not gonna, you won't get, you won't
4586500	4589220	be able to get all the new, be able to do all the new stuff and whatnot.
4589220	4591220	Is these, expansion is what, 20 bucks?
4591220	4592220	15 bucks?
4592220	4593220	20 bucks?
4593220	4594220	Um, I don't know.
4594220	4595220	I don't look into it.
4595220	4596220	I really don't know.
4596220	4598220	I know on live, you can, on live, you can download it.
4598220	4599220	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
4599220	4600220	On live, you can download it.
4600220	4601220	Because I have to uninstall it.
4601220	4602220	40 bucks?
4602220	4603220	Geez.
4603220	4604220	I don't know about that.
4604220	4605220	Yeah, that's a bit much.
4605220	4612180	But yeah, I mean, I, like I said, I still play that, I still play that game because
4612180	4616180	it gives, it keeps me from playing, it's the only game I play on my PlayStation 2 now.
4616180	4617180	That's the sad part.
4617180	4619980	I don't play anything else on it.
4619980	4620980	But anyway.
4620980	4623780	Uh, anything else you want to share, Dark Knight, with our listeners?
4623780	4627820	Uh, no one else about it, but um, permission to plug?
4627820	4630020	Oh, hell, why not?
4630020	4631020	Because we like ya.
4631020	4637560	Okay, um, I kind of blend my voice to two shows on radio station called Disagenius Radio.
4637560	4642540	One is my show called DJ Dark Knight's Ninja Dojo, and the number one is called, um, Anime
4642540	4648220	Damashi on there, which is hosted by, um, the Rob D, me, Foodie Monster, and I guess
4648220	4653380	the others, which is basically anime show, all, um, anime podcast shows.
4653380	4656940	Tune in if you like, we on, we got podcasts out and everything, so.
4656940	4657940	Nice.
4657940	4658940	Alright, that's it.
4658940	4661740	Have a good night, enjoy your Easter, talk to y'all later.
4661740	4663740	Alright, have a good one.
4663740	4664740	Bye.
4664740	4665740	Bye.
4665740	4666740	What do you think?
4666740	4667740	One more call?
4667740	4668740	We'll do one more call.
4668740	4669740	Sure.
4669740	4670740	Uno mas.
4670740	4677460	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4677460	4681020	If we are going to be doing a break from live broadcasting for a little while and going
4681020	4686880	to tape, we will be sure to, uh, have more time for calls next week as we, uh, say goodbye
4686880	4690220	to Live Thesis 5, because believe it or not, next week is going to be our last show on
4690220	4691820	Live Thesis 5 no matter what.
4691820	4693820	It's kind of odd.
4693820	4696140	Kind of scary in a way.
4696140	4697140	Eh.
4697140	4698140	Eh.
4698140	4700140	That's, uh, Loki's attitude.
4700140	4701140	Whatever.
4701140	4705020	Do you have any other last minute stories for us, Loki?
4705020	4706020	Yeah.
4706020	4710880	This week in the US, uh, Virtual Console will be getting King's Knight on the NES and Power
4710880	4712940	Ball on Genesis.
4712940	4715500	I don't know what either one of those are.
4715500	4716500	Sorry.
4716500	4718060	That was something else.
4718060	4721140	I'm saving it for later.
4721140	4723140	Okay.
4723140	4725140	Let's see here.
4725140	4734060	So, uh, what have we got here, apparently some idiot is working on Mac OS X or something
4734060	4737460	that resembles Mac OS X for the PSP.
4737460	4738940	Why?
4738940	4740340	Why?
4740340	4745220	Uh, there's some homebrew thing that someone made apparently that will remove duplicate
4745220	4748740	channels that you may have from playing import games.
4748740	4751820	Uh, so that's kind of neat.
4751820	4762580	Let's see here, and, uh, some rumors from EGM, including Tech Mobile is heading to the
4762580	4767700	Wii and the classic version of the game is coming to the DS, and apparently Warren Spector's
4767700	4772140	new Disney project that he's working on is a platformer and the goal is to give Mario
4772140	4773940	a run for his money.
4773940	4777940	The star of the big platformer would be none other than Mickey Mouse.
4777940	4779100	Hmm.
4779100	4782460	That'd be interesting.
4782460	4783460	That's it.
4783460	4784460	Alright.
4784460	4786740	Well, we're actually going to go ahead and close the Skype line because I just realized
4786740	4788020	we are running a little bit long.
4788020	4792020	It's almost, it's already midnight on the east coast, nine o'clock here, so we'll take
4792020	4793420	plenty more calls next week.
4793420	4794420	Don't worry.
4794420	4796480	Uh, we're going to go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thoughts though
4796480	4798300	in the meantime because we're about ready to wrap up.
4798300	4801260	So, uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought for us tonight?
4801260	4803940	Milkshake.
4803940	4807460	My final thought is I would really like my appetite back.
4807460	4812420	Loki, my final thought is this chair is really uncomfortable.
4812420	4813420	Sorry about that.
4813420	4814420	It's alright.
4814420	4817340	Hey, if I can find another fluffy chair like Dark Soccer is for cheap, I'll get one of
4817340	4818340	those.
4818340	4821540	This is metal, and that's why I keep standing up because it...
4821540	4823420	No, I'm sorry.
4823420	4825740	Alright, well, that's it.
4825740	4829280	That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, and tune in again
4829280	4833740	next week for the last show on Live 365 where hopefully we'll be able to tell you what the
4833740	4836340	plan for the future is after that.
4836340	4840660	Thank you guys as always for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
4840660	4841660	Really appreciate it.
4841660	4842660	You guys are awesome.
4842660	4843660	Thanks for supporting us.
4843660	4846420	And remember, if you like Orange Lounge Radio, or even if you don't like this show, at least
4846420	4850820	spread the word and help independent radio break through because we don't have advertising
4850820	4851820	dollars.
4851820	4853140	We don't have big magazines behind us.
4853140	4854460	We don't have any of that.
4854460	4858600	So that's going to do it.
4858600	4862460	So until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.
4862460	4863900	That's Dark Soccer.
4863900	4868860	He's Loki, and together we are Orange Lounge Radio.
