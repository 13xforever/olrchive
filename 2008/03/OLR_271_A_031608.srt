00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, March 16th, 2008, Tetris and Bomberman are WiiWare bound,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
E! Amuse hits the DDR scene in North America,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and are the rumors about a Blu-ray drive on the 360 true?

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that program on the internet, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week, also here with you every week, the one and only, Dark Sakura.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How are you, Miss Summers?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm completely enamored with what I'm looking at.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What are you looking at, Preto?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
A melodica.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A melodica. Are you shopping for musical instruments online tonight?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes, I am.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Did last week's techno didgeridoo inspire you to come up with an underappreciated instrument of your own?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, I actually have, there's a few instruments that I personally want to own myself.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
One of them is a melodica, which is like a keyboard, but you play it like, with the mouthpiece.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nice.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And so it sounds sort of like a harmonica, but not quite.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I also want an autoharp.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Fun.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because I used to play autoharp when I was little.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What about Kazoo? Does Kazoo not satisfy anyone anymore? Is that the problem?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Not really.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
My wife autoharps.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Say hello to the smartass over there, Tech Master Loki.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hi.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So your wife autoharps, huh?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's nice to know.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't have to tell her to complain at all. She just does it on her own.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How are you? Oh, I get it. There's a joke in there.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And how are you otherwise this week, Tech Master Loki?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm okay.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Excellent. Are you shopping for any musical instruments of your own?

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay. Just checking.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, well, let's get into how we always start off the show.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
First, let me introduce the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There's several people in chat tonight.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Kind of a smaller turnout, though, on the live stream than I've seen in recent weeks, so I'm not sure.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is there something else going on tonight I'm not aware of?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No more Grammy Awards? No Oscars? No Super Bowl?

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's, I guess...

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go outside night?

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
St. Patty's Eve, I don't know.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, maybe people are camping out outside the bars waiting for 6 a.m. I don't know.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All right, well, who knows?

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Anyhow, we'll work with what we've got and also our little contingent over on Justin TV on our feed there,

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
which, by the way, brand new addition to our Justin TV arsenal.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We now have a video capture card, so when we bring you clips of games,

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
we'll actually, instead of having to point the camera at the TV, the little getaway,

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
we'll actually be able to run the feed from the TV.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's very exciting. Happy, happy, happy.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All right, so anyhow, let's get into how we always start off the show.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How was your gaming week?

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off? How was your gaming week?

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
My week was pretty sparse just because I've been so busy all week,

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
so all I played was Ragnarok, and we actually had to play a little pinball,

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but we have a purchase that might be coming up in our game future.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Good time. What's that?

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Stern is releasing a new Indiana Jones pinball machine,

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and Dan said he'd even be willing to sell Creature of the Black Lagoon to obtain it.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Nice. So that's going to be expensive, though, a new machine?

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
A brand new machine.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You guys are crazy.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, he said he might even let go since his pinball party.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Wow. But, I mean, it is an Indiana Jones machine. That is kind of awesome.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a new Indiana Jones machine.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That is kind of awesome.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We actually have the old one in our garage right now.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I imagine it's to coincide with the new Kingdom of the Crystal Skull movie?

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I do believe so. That would be quite likely.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Nice. That would be fun.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The pinball rules.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Anything else besides pinball and that stuff?

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Ragnarok.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Ragnarok.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And Scrabble.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Have you been playing the Scrabble game on Facebook?

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't go on Facebook.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Facebook has a very Scrabble-like game. In fact, I think they got in trouble for it.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's actually an application called Scrabulous, is what it's called.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You can play Scrabble with friends on Facebook, basically.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And as much as Facebook kind of bugs me, I do like being able to play Scrabble with friends online.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't know if it's the same one.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It was something that was linked to me.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But I was doing the Solitaire mode on it.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm pretty sure you have to be a Facebook member to use Scrabulous, so it was probably something different.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have a Facebook, but the last thing I actually did with it was through my phone when one of my friends in Mississippi found me in Facebook somehow and friended me.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You know, Jamie, I was just going to mention that I saw this earlier today than I thought of you guys.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Street Fighter IV, they're taking pre-orders on it right now. It's $2,590 with an $880 deposit for the arcade hardware.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, for the machine? I was like, for the game? Oh.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hmm.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But what kind of machine do you have to put that in?

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, normally the machines are $23,000.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So, I mean, it's probably, you know, but, I mean, come on, 2DX?

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I mean, shit, that's just like a computer with an HD screen attached to it and a sound system.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, I mean, most of these things nowadays, you can probably hook it up to a TV and build your own control panel for it.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't think it's too sophisticated.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I mean, it's just a game.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You just have to be able to run the...

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah. It's just a game.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I mean, games, arcade games, haven't really changed too much as far as, like, okay, put coin in, you know, control panel, monitor.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's it. Hooking that stuff up isn't that hard.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's still not like where you could get one of those super guns and just hook it up to it, but, you know.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, let me know if you end up doing that, Jamie. That's pretty hardcore, but then again...

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I doubt it.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But then again, I'm like, well, you are going to buy that Indiana Jones pinball machine.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Dan was talking about buying it.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay. Talking and doing are two different things. That is true.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I know, and he talks a lot.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Big talker.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I mean, wait.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, let's move on then to Loki before Dark Soccer gets yourself in trouble.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I was going to say too, it says apparently it comes with a Street Fighter IV network ID card and some versus communication kit.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So you can actually play other people online using your kit if you bought it.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know. If I only have $3,000 to throw around, of course I don't.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I probably wouldn't spend it on Street Fighter IV because I suck at Street Fighter.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Anyways.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know what I would do if I had that much money?

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Make a down payment on a house and move.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You're going to need more than $3,000 for a down payment.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I was thinking, like, the cost of the cabinet.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ah. Well, $23,000. I would cover it.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Now, this week I didn't play a whole lot. I just played basically N+.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A few lunches I played that.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So it's fun. It's just like N. I think I'm on the 10th level.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But there's like 5 or 6 stages per level.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Some of them are pretty hard, but that's N.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then the rest of the time I've been playing Smash Bros., but I've just basically been doing the Space Emissary mode, which is varying levels of cool and crap.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sometimes I'm just like, oh, this is pretty good level design, and some other times it's just like, uhhh, I don't know, this is pretty dumb.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But, overall, I'm still playing it and I'm only halfway through it.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Actually, a little over halfway through it.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But, other than that, I don't know. It's pretty good.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How was N+, overall?

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's what some folks in chat are asking.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:14,000
N+, I like it, but it's not too different than just the regular N, except for the fact that, I don't know, different levels.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's it.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Alright, well, moving on to my gaming week.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I've actually been kind of sick this week, which you would think would make me want to stay home and play a lot of games, but it kind of sucked my will to do a lot of things.

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I've been having these weird pains all over my side.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Now I want to get into all the nasty details about it.

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Basically, doctors don't even know what it is, and I've taken medications that have caused, now, side effects, blah, blah, blah.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It kind of sucks.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, yeah, I didn't play a lot of games because of it.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I did play a few things.

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Very random stuff.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Some of the things I played were very random.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I played Phantasy Star 2.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I decided to download on Virtual Console quite randomly, and I checked that out, and that was kind of cool.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Although, I don't know, Phantasy Star 2 wasn't quite as cool as Final Fantasy, but it was different.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It was kind of cool.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is one of those games, because I never had a Genesis growing up, so it was kind of one of those games I missed.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's kind of neat, though, now that I've played Phantasy Star online, to kind of see some of the history of the Phantasy Star universe and see where a lot of that stuff has come from.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So, that's kind of cool.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's see, what else have I checked out?

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
World of Warcraft, as always.

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Addict and all that stuff.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's see, what else have I played this week?

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm totally drawing a blank.

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I actually skipped out on Lost Odyssey this week.

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, I checked out Brain Challenge, that new Xbox Live arcade game.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It was kind of dumb.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The minigames were kind of dumb.

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The minigames were just kind of...

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't know.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I guess if you don't have Brain Age on the DS, or I don't know, the whole novelty of these brain training games has really worn off, let's face it.

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The market's been really oversaturated.

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I guess this is the only type of it available on the Xbox 360.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If you must have a minigame collection for your very own on the Xbox 360, then you can go ahead and check that out.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But, honestly, it's really nothing to scream about.

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So, that would be that.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's really it for my gaming week.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
All right, so moving on to housekeeping this week.

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Not a lot that we have to say for housekeeping this week, other than, of course, as always, you can join our LiveJournal community.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
At Orange Lounge is our LiveJournal community, or our MySpace is at Orange Lounge Radio.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Of course, we have our Facebook community, the OL Army.

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You can join the social network and help pour out OLR to all your friends and your enemies, if you so choose.

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But, of course, word of mouth is how we always spread the word about our show, so we always thank folks who choose to do that.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All right, we're having some technical problems in the studio right now, but hopefully things are on their way to being fixed.

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's just that, man, 2008 is just year of broken over here, year of fail.

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know what's up with that.

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But, never mind, we're just going to try to proceed as normal.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And, Loki, if we can, we're going to start off the gaming news.

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,000
All right, so this week they officially announced that Super Mario Kart Wii will be coming to the U.S. on April 27th.

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That is, two days before Grand Theft Auto IV.

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But, hey, I mean, people on the Wii, they don't get Grand Theft Auto IV, so you get Mario Kart Wii.

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
No cars being stolen in this game, but, you know, it's still pretty violent.

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Anyways, some other cool stuff that you'll, of course, get the Wii Wheel with this, and it will also be sold separately on the side.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Apparently, they're going to have, you know, 32 different courses, up to 12 players online, and Mii integration, 10 battle arenas,

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and, of course, you know, support for a bunch of different control methods, much like Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So, that's pretty awesome.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I plan on picking up both, though.

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I noticed some of the retro levels are making an appearance in Mario Kart. That's kind of interesting.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Some of them are pretty cool. IGN actually had some footage of five levels that they had in their pre-release copy.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They're, I don't know what you'd call it, Alpha or whatever.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And, they've got Course 4 from the Super Nintendo Mario Kart, and that's pretty awesome looking.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then, they had a remake of the Block Fort from Nintendo 64.

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Although, it looks a little different, though. It's not just a direct, like, remake of it.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They've got a bunch of additional stuff on there, but it's still, you know, Block Fort.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And then, let's see, what else was there?

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Some of the ones I didn't play, though.

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They had one from the Game Boy Advance one, which I don't remember any of the battle modes in the Game Boy Advance one.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And, there's also some from, you know, Double Dash and the DS one.

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But, to be honest, you know, Double Dash's battle mode kind of blew, and a DS I didn't play.

213
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So, you know, at least the battle mode part of it.

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But, it's your favorite part. How could you say that?

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It is my favorite part, but I was so jaded after Double Dash, you know, that I just decided not to check it out on DS.

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Alright, well, let's read some feedback in the chat room.

217
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
chat.orangeslaundryator.com, and we'll start off with a comment tonight from Jaded.

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It says, between that and Brawl, I can say goodbye to my bank account.

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm probably going to mispronounce this name, I apologize.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Queltipo? I think that's how I say it, Queltipo?

221
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It says, the Wii wheel is about as useful as jamming the Wiimote into a giant pretzel.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And, you can do that, too, as long as the pretzel is sideways.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can actually use a pretzel as a Wii steering wheel.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We should do that on the show, that'd be fun.

225
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That might be kind of fun.

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I was going to say, one thing that's not...

227
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And delicious.

228
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And delicious, yeah. Mmm, yummy!

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm going to do that.

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We can also do, like, the Wii Cinnabon and, you know, alternate controller methods.

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That'd be sticky.

232
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That would be kind of messy.

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Use a hamburger bun. It's circular.

234
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I was going to say, one thing that's not coming, though, to Mario Kart Wii is snaking.

235
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And I know that I'm very happy about that.

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Apparently, according to the official Nintendo magazine in the UK, snaking is gone.

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
They've changed how the boosting is done, I guess, around corners.

238
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And no longer will you be able to speed boost by waggling the controls left and right as you power slide.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This has, I guess, been scrapped, and now your speed boost is determined by how long you can hold the slide.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sure someone will find a different way to do it.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sure it'll be exploited one way or another.

242
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But, hey, that's kind of neat.

243
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Of course, now, you know how our chat room works, and a little joke comes up, and then everybody exploits it best they can.

244
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We've got Wii Chiro, Wii Tortilla, Wii Hot Dog Bun.

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That actually kind of... Wii Hot Dog Bun?

246
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That worked.

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
For Mario Kart controls.

248
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What else did I want to read here?

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
SSG100Matt says, Mario Kart Wii looks like it's ripped from the arcade version.

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I kind of hope not, because the arcade version, I don't know, it just doesn't have that same feel to me.

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The arcade version feels, I don't know, it feels stripped of the magic.

252
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So I take all the magic out of Mario Kart and you have the arcade version.

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't know how to explain it.

254
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You would think Mario Kart arcade would be, like, best thing ever, but it feels so generic when I play it.

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know.

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is it just me?

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The only thing that was cool about that was the feature to take your picture.

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But, obviously, they can't do that in, you know, on the Wii, because one, they don't have a camera, and two...

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Well, that we know of.

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I mean, it might be one of those things where, hey, guess what?

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The Wii had a secret compartment the whole time that's been taking your picture.

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It has, like, you know, then there'd be ass faces, you know, for racing in a Mario Kart.

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I see what you did there.

264
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
A little joke from last week.

265
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I got it.

266
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
All right.

267
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Again, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelauncetradio.com.

268
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You know, Mario Kart Wii isn't the only thing to get excited about this year if you're a Nintendo fan.

269
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Reggie Fils-Aime is dropping some hints that there's a big holiday game coming out this year.

270
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Of course.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I mean, obviously, every company's got to have their big holiday game.

272
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It will be revealed at this year's E3.

273
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's right.

274
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He mentioned this in an interview with Jeff Keighley on Game Trailers TV.

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He says that the second half of 08's lineup will be announced at E3, which will probably include this year's big holiday title.

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Who knows?

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Some things that Reggie was asked about, the orchestra conductor demo.

278
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Remember that thing you saw at the very first E3 where the Wii showed up, which was the last E3 most of us went to?

279
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, Wii Music.

280
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Don't know if that's actually going to be a full game yet.

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I mean, we did hear about that Wii Music game, but there was never any word if the conductor thing was a part of that.

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It is, yeah.

284
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, is it?

285
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, that's the game.

286
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, well, they asked him, Reggie, point blank about this, and Reggie said,

287
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Who knows? Maybe that's one of the things we'll talk about at E3.

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Kind of dodging the question.

289
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Lame!

290
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He also dodged a question about Donkey Kong Wii.

291
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No, thanks.

292
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm sorry, Donkey Kong Bunga Blast sucked enough.

293
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't need another Donkey Kong game.

294
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Reggie did say that all the E3 releases, or actually, sorry, post-E3 releases, will be, quote, maximizing all of our key franchises.

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So you can bet it's going to be either like an F-Zero game, the Animal Crossing game, which most people are speculating.

296
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I would bet it's the Animal Crossing game. It's going to be their big holiday title.

297
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's what I think.

298
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And what other big franchises have they still got a milk?

299
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Kirby?

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They haven't really milked Kirby on the Wii yet, have they?

301
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No.

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They did milk Kirby on the DS, but not yet.

303
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think there's going to be some type of Animal Crossing that will have some nifty little online feature that's going to make everybody want it.

304
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I say Animal Crossing Wii is their big title.

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
They better fucking release Excite Truck 2.

306
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What if F-Zero was kind of Excite Truck-ish?

307
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's not.

308
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry, that's like saying wipeouts, you know, like, Excite Truck.

309
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's not.

310
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's just, eh.

311
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's too hard.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Dark Sakura, any thoughts on what the big title could be?

313
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I was thinking about it.

314
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And I am leaning toward Animal Crossing?

315
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Mm-hmm.

316
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Or possibly a Donkey Kong?

317
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The problem that I had, because he said it's for the gamers, which makes you kind of think it might be something for more hardcore gamers, but also something that people would like to get into and stuff.

318
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Animal Crossing, not really for the hardcore gamers, but that sounds feasible that they would do that.

319
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And every single Animal Crossing game I've ever heard of has always come out around that time of the year.

320
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So, you know, that'd be my guess.

321
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And because they're whores like that and they would want to do that.

322
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And now, especially once we get to that point in, you know, when that game is released, they'll have a perfect service for downloadable content and microtransactions and ooh, we can pour the hell out of that.

323
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yep, yep.

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll tell you my Dark Horse candidate, though.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The game that, you know, maybe it's just hope that this would be their big announcement.

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But I would say my Dark Horse candidate for the holiday game would be Kid Icarus on Wii.

327
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But I don't know, I mean...

328
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think that's coming, but I don't think that's going to be it.

329
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I have a feeling it's going to come back.

330
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I mean, it just worked so well in Smash Brothers.

331
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And like, I mean, you watch some of those cinematics and play some of those stages and you're like, God damn, they could put out a Kid Icarus game on the Wii and it would be awesome.

332
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So, or as Act F says in chat, Kid Week-er-us.

333
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
New Mario RPG, that would be fucking awesome.

334
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah.

335
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We'll see.

336
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's see, some other comments from chat.

337
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Devay in chat says, Microsoft took all the DK platformer game rights after they purchased Rare.

338
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Odd1 says, yeah, it's probably Animal Crossing.

339
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
They said at the end of the anime movie that it'd be coming.

340
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And it's also kind of one of those obvious things, like, someday there will be another Zelda game and another Mario game.

341
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I just wish, though, that Nintendo would come up with a new franchise.

342
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm all down with that, too.

343
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I think they should come up with a new franchise.

344
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Because it's nice, you know, that we get a new Mario game and a new Metroid game, but it's like, you know, you take all the surprise out of things because we know that there's going to be, every time you're going to put out a new system, there's obviously going to be a Mario game and that kind of stuff.

345
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But, you know, it's like with, what, the PlayStation stuff, I guess there's always going to be a new Ratchet and Clank and that kind of crap, but I don't know.

346
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah, to be fair, Nintendo does seem to put out a few original IPs that do rather well.

347
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I mean, let's see, they had the Donkey Kong bongo game, Pikmin.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They had, what else, I'm trying to think of the GameCube era that came out, I guess not Luigi's Mansion, I don't know.

349
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But, you know, I don't know. I think it's possible for them to come up with some new stuff.

350
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I mean, they've done it before.

351
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
WarioWare? Was that on GameCube? No, that started on Game Boy Advance, didn't it?

352
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That was fun on GameCube, wasn't it?

353
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It was pretty fun on the GameCube.

354
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But, I mean, they're capable of churning out some new stuff once in a while when they really want to.

355
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Wii Sports 2.

356
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We're going to whore that franchise like a bitch.

357
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Well, Wii Sports is kind of a new IP, right?

358
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That could be a holiday title too, why not Wii Sports 2?

359
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You know the soccer moms across America would eat that shit up.

360
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Because they're going to whore it like a bitch, I'm trademarking that.

361
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Alright, well, we'll see at this year's E3.

362
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, for things that we said we would stop and wait and see on.

363
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It looks like Manhunt 2 is getting a UK release after all.

364
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,000
According to the BBFC, they have no alternative but to give the 18 certificate to it.

365
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Because, basically, I guess they were overruled.

366
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was actually twice rejected and it went up for review again and they said, okay, we have to.

367
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So they finally just caved?

368
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Pretty much.

369
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's kind of interesting.

370
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It was actually, the video appeals committee gave it their own review and so because they've decided it should come out, it's going to come out.

371
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You know, I guess I'm not too surprised by this but what kind of makes me think that maybe they finally decided to let it come out is maybe they saw what happened in America is that the game came out and nobody cared because the game kind of sucked.

372
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Maybe.

373
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm wondering if that didn't have an influence on it where they're like, well, I don't think it's really going to pollute the masses because the game kind of sucks.

374
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:42,000
No, they said that they were very unhappy with the appeal but they were basically strong armed into it.

375
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I saw that they had a modified version for the Wii in case you have a mod ship and stuff with all the, you know, blurring crazy lighting gone.

376
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Whatever.

377
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Too bad the game sucks and, you know, it's not worth playing.

378
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Do we have any, I know we don't have a whole lot of overseas listeners that listen live but are there any of our overseas listeners planning on purchasing this game overseas?

379
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I bet I'm going to hear a lot of no's.

380
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You don't want it.

381
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Do yourself a favor.

382
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But there's no release date announced for it yet.

383
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If you want to see something like, if you want to play a game kind of like that, I guess, and more fun, maybe try the Godfather game and maybe No More Heroes.

384
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Or just wait for something better.

385
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
There you go.

386
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Even better.

387
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Something better.

388
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I like that.

389
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Something better, the game.

390
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That could be the new Nintendo IP.

391
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Something better.

392
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Something better.

393
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You're going to buy it.

394
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah.

395
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So we may be getting WiiWare in May but of course Japan being super awesome and everything.

396
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
They get it March 25th and they're going to be launching with quite a few games.

397
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Right now they've got, of course, some of these I don't think we're getting but Okiraku Ping Pong Wii by Arc System for 500 points.

398
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Word puzzle Mojipitan Wii for 1,000 points and I hear that one also has microtransactions too for little bonus puzzles that you can buy.

399
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Oh, hooray.

400
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Sakusaku Animal Panic by Konami for 1,000 points.

401
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Star Soldier...

402
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Wait, 4,000 points?

403
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
1,000 points.

404
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh, I thought you said 4,000.

405
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm like, fuck that.

406
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Ain't worth buying that.

407
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Ok.

408
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Star Soldier R by Hudson for 800 points.

409
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
My Life as a King Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for 1,500 points.

410
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Angel Solitaire by G-Mode for 500 points.

411
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Dr. Mario and Baculous Extermination for 1,000 points.

412
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I love that name.

413
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Sounds painful.

414
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Baculous.

415
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Everybody's Pokemon Ranch for 1,000 points and Long Puss by Genki for 1,000 points.

416
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Sounds not bad.

417
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I don't know.

418
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm kind of looking forward to the service.

419
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It'll be interesting to see what kind of games are on there.

420
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
When are we supposed to be getting that here?

421
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Did they say May?

422
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It was like May 20 something.

423
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I think May 20th or around that time.

424
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So what's so special about these games?

425
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What's going to make me want to purchase them?

426
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I mean, what's interesting about it is that you won't really be able to play a demo.

427
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Well, I don't know.

428
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I guess we don't really know until the service launches in Japan what kind of secrets might be waiting, but you don't really get to play demos of the games.

429
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Assuming it runs like Virtual Console, you don't get to really play a demo of the games.

430
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You don't really play any of these games online with other people.

431
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Or is that slowly going to be coming out?

432
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You might be able to. I'm not sure.

433
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And there's no achievements or leaderboards or anything we're hearing about.

434
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What's the perk to get these games?

435
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
They're just more games.

436
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I guess.

437
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I mean, I guess maybe that's a stupid question because a lot of games that you might buy on the PC and stuff don't have a lot of those types of frills.

438
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Especially the casual-type games.

439
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But, you know, I don't know.

440
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I think now in this day and age, part of the charms of having the online connections and online gaming is getting to somewhat compete with friends.

441
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I really don't like the way that Nintendo handles their online, especially the friend stuff, the friend codes.

442
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That's got to go.

443
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, we'll see.

444
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean, when the service actually launches in Japan, which is very, very soon, only about a week away.

445
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Actually, we should know more details on next week's show, right?

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Because they're a day ahead in Japan.

447
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I would think so, yeah.

448
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So we should know more next week's show.

449
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Except today's the 16th and that would be the 23rd.

450
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh, wait.

451
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I can't do math.

452
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Okay, then two weeks.

454
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Two weeks will know more details.

455
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
All right.

456
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Well, in the meantime, we do know some more details about some of the other games that will be coming out on the WiiWare.

457
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
One of them is Tetris.

458
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Tetris Online will be coming on the WiiWare and you can play it with up to six players.

459
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And I'm guessing since it's a matchup with Tetris Online, I'm guessing you can play up to six players online.

460
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm looking at these screenshots, I see two different Miis.

461
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Well, you would have to be able to play up to six players online since the Wii can only support up to four.

462
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh, snap.

463
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Well, technically you could do five because remember, was it Bomberman?

464
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You could do the fifth one with the GameCube controllers, yeah.

465
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So I'm assuming, yeah, some of these games are going to be online, which is a little better now.

466
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So if you need another version of Tetris, you'll be able to play that on the Wii very soon.

467
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
One thing I want to point out, though, based on some of these screenshots I'm looking at that's kind of cool,

468
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm looking at one particular two-player mode and it looks like the wells aren't separated.

469
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It actually looks like the wells are combined into one giant well.

470
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So I'm not sure if there's a two-player mode where maybe both players play one giant board at the same time.

471
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That's kind of interesting, a different spin on a well-known formula.

472
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah.

473
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It looks like this game might bring some new things to the table, which is a good thing.

474
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You need Puzzle Fighter Wii.

475
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I just asked about why I would need these types of games.

476
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Puzzle Fighter Wii.

477
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That'd be awesome with like Street Fighter IV characters.

478
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You never know.

479
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
RasteelUT comments in the chat room, chat.orangewoncholster.com.

480
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Ooh, Tetris, that's so new and independent.

481
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, in a way, if you think about the history of Tetris, it actually is a very independent game at its roots,

482
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
but I mean, I get the point.

483
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Obviously, it's not that anymore.

484
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And people are still playing fucking Pac-Man Championship Edition.

485
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That's just Pac-Man with neon lights.

486
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I mean, that's all it fucking is.

487
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But Pac-Man Championship Edition is kind of rad.

488
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't know.

489
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
There's something about it.

490
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And Pac-Man.

491
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's neon lights and rave music.

492
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You know, all you need to do now is come out with like the Pac-Man DS system,

493
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and all you whores will buy it like nothing.

494
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Darkdetsuya comments in the chat room that, Rob, they actually had that mode that I'm describing there on Tengen Tetris.

495
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Remember the Forbidden Tetris on the NES many years ago?

496
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I have it.

497
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That got cut up on a licensing debacle?

498
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
That would be even a better name for this online version.

499
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Forbidden Tetris.

500
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Forbidden Tetris.

501
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I have Tengen Tetris.

502
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah?

503
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yes, I do.

504
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So you own Forbidden Tetris?

505
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yes, I do.

506
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I want Tangram Tetris.

507
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That would be fascinating.

508
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Whatever happened to the really shitty Tetris knockoffs we got?

509
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Like, remember when Tetris got really popular like in the early 90s or so?

510
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We got tons of just shitty, shitty ripoffs.

511
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
We had Word-Tris and Hat-Tris and what else?

512
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Face-Tris.

513
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But Blastris was real.

514
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Well-Tris.

515
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Tetris 2 Bomb Bliss.

516
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Blastris was fun because you could shoot things.

517
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Shooting always makes things better, right?

518
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It was a Super Scope game.

519
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Alright.

520
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That was what made it cool.

521
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Alright, enough reminiscing, I'm sorry.

522
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Well, something else that is cool, and this is particularly cool for me, because I love

523
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Hudson, and they're bringing us a real Bomberman.

524
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Well, okay, it's for WiiWare, and it actually is real Bomberman.

525
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I mean, we're talking about up to eight players in one game, at least that's what Famitsu

526
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
says.

527
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's going to be out in Japan in June, so hopefully we'll get it not too long, I hope.

528
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But it's Bomberman.

529
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I love Bomberman.

530
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I know, and Bomberman's cool and all that.

531
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't know, maybe it's just me.

532
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm a little burned out on Bomberman.

533
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
How can you be burned out on Bomberman when all we've had are like little minigame crap

534
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and then that horrible, horrible, I'm going to be Bomberman, but I'm going to be hardcore.

535
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh, Bomberman X-Zero?

536
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
As in, piece of shit Bomberman.

537
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

538
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
There was, and maybe that kind of just ruined Bomberman for me, like it's like watching

539
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
your childhood get raped right in front of your eyes.

540
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
We still regularly break out the Super Nintendo and the MultiTap and play, you know, Bomberman

541
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
2, Super Bomberman 2.

542
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm thinking more of the recent Xbox Live one.

543
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Remember how they had a Bomberman come out on Xbox Live, and it was pretty faithful to

544
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
the original?

545
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I just, my resounding reaction to the game was, meh.

546
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But this is an actual new Bomberman, it's Hudson!

547
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Listen, Hudson, we play Bomberman on every system that's ever been made, ever, and then

548
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
some, and then you release four versions of it.

549
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Listen, I know that it might seem like a good idea to release a lot of these each year,

550
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
because, you know, you need money.

551
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I understand that.

552
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But, at the same time, I don't know, other companies need to do the same thing, because,

553
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
fucking, fucking aye dude, how many Harvest Moon games do they really need to fucking

554
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
make?

555
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I mean, they're really getting bad at that shit.

556
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
There's like four games coming out each year now.

557
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'd say more than four games.

558
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I mean, that's whoring.

559
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Okay, I'm reading something else on here on the actual Famitsu article.

560
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Sure.

561
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And from what I can see, you can actually play as your me as a character in this game.

562
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Oh, in that case, I gotta buy that.

563
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I sense that comment has a hint of sarcasm.

564
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Well, no, I'm picking, I'm just trying to pick out what I can actually read on this.

565
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That is kind of cool, to be honest.

566
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I think that is an interesting feature.

567
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I don't know why.

568
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Can I mail away for an actual bomb, like, piece of plastic that I can put on my Wii

569
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
remote so that, you know, I can pretend I'm the real Bomberman, and look at me, I have

570
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
a bomb controller.

571
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's also saying something in here about you're getting a whole bunch of extra bonus items

572
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and bomb upgrades.

573
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You know, the usual stuff, it looks like there's some new stuff in here, and there's also,

574
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
it looks like, more area effect bombs on here, too.

575
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I was just reading this over.

576
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
DarkSakura, somebody is in your fan club in chat.

577
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Somebody is on your side here.

578
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Odd1 in chat says, Bomberman is like Metal Slug.

579
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I only want more, damn it.

580
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yes, okay.

581
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Okay, how, how, you, you know that if I really like a game, I tend to like the entire series

582
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
of it, no matter how much repetition it has, which makes me really pissed off that they

583
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
haven't done another bus to move and we just got dance on it.

584
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's people like you that will make SNK constantly release the same damn game over and over and

585
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
over again.

586
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's people like me that keep SNK in business.

587
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah, seriously, because if people smarten it up and say, hey, wait a second, didn't

588
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I buy this like four times already, that, you know.

589
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Well, maybe they'll actually bring out the sequels that I want, which I'll get into later

590
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
in the show.

591
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Here's my suggestion, though, for how to make Bomberman a little more appealing to

592
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
people like me.

593
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Forbidden Bomberman.

594
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He's on to something.

595
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
In blood effects.

596
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm telling you.

597
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I want blood effects.

598
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
God damn, I'm working on the wrong side of gaming.

599
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I shouldn't be bitching about games like I do on the show.

600
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I should be making games.

601
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Okay.

602
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Show of hands in chat.

603
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Forbidden Bomberman, Y or N. Listen, here's what you need to do, okay.

604
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
This is a small bit of innovation, and it's ripping a little bit off of Taito, but who

605
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
cares.

606
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Bomberman, mixed with Rampage.

607
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You're blowing up cities, and you're fighting each other.

608
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Who doesn't want that?

609
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
People like blowing things up, but they want a little bit more than just blowing up little

610
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
cartoon characters.

611
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
We need to take out, like, cities.

612
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I like Rampage.

613
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
We need to quit our damn jobs and start a gaming company.

614
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You are on a goldmine here.

615
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Bomberman mixed with Rampage.

616
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Genius.

617
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Forbidden Bomberman.

618
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,560
Who doesn't like to blow up cities full of innocent people?

619
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
In games.

620
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,780
Only in game form.

621
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,140
Not in real life.

622
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Just in game form.

623
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,120
Just great stress reliever.

624
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
Bomberman Rampage.

625
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,640
Alright.

626
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,880
Anyhow.

627
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:34,400
If Bomberman's not your type of game, then maybe this brand new game called Oichi De

628
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,760
Puti Puti, which, I know that sounds retarded, and it is kind of retarded.

629
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,800
It's actually a game based off of this toy that you can get, it's a keychain toy called

630
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,400
Puti Puti, and what it does is it makes bubble wrap popping noises, and this whole game is

631
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,000
popping bubble wrap.

632
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,360
Yes, they really want you to pay eight dollars, or eight hundred Wii points, to buy a game

633
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,840
that you pop bubble wrap.

634
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,600
I want it.

635
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
It's pretty.

636
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Pretty dumb!

637
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,260
No, I was looking at the backgrounds and stuff, that's actually kind of pretty.

638
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Game bubble wrap.

639
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,260
Awesome.

640
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,260
You know.

641
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,260
I have bubble wrap at my house.

642
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,260
How about the real thing?

643
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
Like, I like popping real b-

644
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,900
This is, honestly, this reminds me of when I went to Barnes and Noble like ten years

645
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,960
ago and found a big thick book full of fat bubble wrap.

646
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,660
I'm not joking, and it was called Stress Relief Book.

647
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,280
I am not kidding.

648
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,680
Are we sure there's not more to this, like maybe it just looks like it's a bubble wrap

649
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,600
popping game, but maybe there's more to it that we just don't know about yet?

650
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
I don't think so.

651
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,560
Is that a bad translation thing gone wrong?

652
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
I don't think so.

653
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,640
It's put out by Namco Bandai, so.

654
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
I mean, like-

655
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,740
So Pac-Man's gonna come out and eat it.

656
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,020
For less than that, though, I could go to See's Candies, because we all know the best

657
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,040
part of See's Candy is that you get the little bubble wrap with everything you buy.

658
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,280
I think that's California only.

659
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Is that only in California?

660
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
I think so.

661
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Well then, you know what-

662
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
I had never heard of See's until I moved out here.

663
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Okay, the national and international people can just deal for a minute here.

664
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,120
California only for a minute here.

665
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,400
It's like getting something in the mail.

666
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,720
The best part of See's Candy is that you get a little piece of bubble wrap in the pack

667
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
with the candy.

668
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
I mean, think about it.

669
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,200
For $10, I get a little box of candy, and not only do I have real bubble wrap to pop,

670
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,160
but I also have- wait for it- candy!

671
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Hello!

672
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,200
Here's the best part, though.

673
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:27,280
There's 40 levels that you'll be able to play, and of course it features vibration feedback.

674
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Ooh.

675
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:36,240
Yeah, and in fact, they have a little link here on asovision.com slash pooty pooty.

676
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:46,000
You can watch a little movie of this stupid little bubble wrap thing, which- oh my god.

677
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,920
You like- that's crazy looking.

678
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,320
It looks like bubble wrap, but it's little buttons, and you pop them.

679
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
It's for stress relief.

680
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,400
It's bubble wrap that never wears out!

681
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,560
I mean, that right there is genius.

682
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,800
Amanda in chat is correcting me and says, the best part is that you get free samples.

683
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,480
I forgot, every time you go into C's, they actually give you a free sample.

684
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Free is the best part.

685
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
Let's see.

686
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,920
Quelltippo, who has a name I'm probably still mispronouncing in chat, says, will it be like

687
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,600
gals panic and after you pop the bubble wrap, you see a naked girl?

688
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:24,720
No, this has a picture of T. Oh, hooray, a picture of T. Oh my god, this is great.

689
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
I want one.

690
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Oh my god.

691
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,240
And it looks like this website sells them in five different colors.

692
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,040
White, blue, pink, orange, and black.

693
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,720
Hell, we can sell orange ones.

694
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,600
I want one to annoy people at work with.

695
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm totally going to get one.

696
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,720
Well, let's talk about more incredibly awesome games that you can be spending your money

697
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,520
on in the near future.

698
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:52,160
There is a new game that is coming out on the DS, and it's called Babysitting Mania.

699
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,760
It's actually a game that you can play on the PC right now.

700
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:03,880
It's available at fenomengames.com, that's F-E-N-O-M-E-N dash G-A-M-E-S dot com.

701
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,200
You can actually play a game called Babysitting Mania, and here's how they advertise it on

702
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
the site.

703
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,720
From the makers of Nanny Mania comes the all new hit, Babysitting Mania.

704
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,460
Find out if you're the ultimate babysitter.

705
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,180
What if you didn't expect was 20 of the craziest houses you've ever imagined being...

706
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:28,600
And if the babies don't behave, then they get beat mania.

707
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,260
Now now.

708
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,760
That's not cool.

709
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,920
Alright, uh, yeah, but apparently they're porting that to the DS.

710
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Why?

711
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,400
Because there's money in them DS's.

712
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
Apparently.

713
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Apparently.

714
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,520
I think if one person buys it, they'll make back their budget.

715
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
I guess.

716
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:54,640
Well, anyway, how about something a little bit better, or maybe worse, depending on your

717
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,440
opinion of certain characters in the Sonic franchise.

718
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,560
Sonic RPG, of course, it's actually Sonic Chronicles, is coming out on the DS, and it

719
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,720
has been confirmed that we are getting some of Sonic's buddies, especially Bill, I'm not

720
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,880
saying Bill the Cat, Big the Cat.

721
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,000
It's the same Bill the Cat, because, you know, we're coming up on election season.

722
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,880
And I used to vote for Bill the Cat.

723
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,640
And plus, Bill the Cat in the game would actually be kind of cooler, I'm sorry.

724
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,400
He'd just walk around spitting on things, and hacking up hairballs, and then getting

725
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,320
drunk with, I guess, hot naked chicks or something.

726
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:40,920
But no, Big the Cat is definitely going to be in it, and it's of course being put out

727
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:50,200
by Bioware, and people, basically the co-founder who they were interviewing, Ray, is it pronounced

728
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:57,480
Musica, I guess, anyway, they actually asked him, you know, well, a lot of people don't

729
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,760
like these characters, he's like, well, the whole point is to make you attach an emotion

730
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,440
to the character, and dislike is an emotion.

731
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,000
It's like, okay.

732
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,320
Anyway, he says that all the characters are going to be really pivotal to the game, and

733
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,880
it's not like a whole bunch of little mini-games, but something that's fully interactive, so.

734
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,600
I guess, I don't know how I feel about that.

735
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,440
I actually thought that Big's part of the game was the most annoying part of Sonic Avenger.

736
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,840
Here, Froggy.

737
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,480
It should stop making retarded Sonic characters.

738
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,640
Like, Amy was cool, because she watched her own smack and stuff with a hammer.

739
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
That was cool.

740
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,200
Knuckles, cool.

741
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,440
Mecha Sonic, really cool.

742
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,480
But, no.

743
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,760
Can I take the show on a completely random, unrelated tangent for just a minute?

744
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Oh, I know.

745
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
I know what you're reading.

746
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
That's the best thing.

747
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,720
Here's the thing, when you were talking about build the cat, I started thinking about all

748
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,000
these comic book cats, right?

749
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,420
I'm like, oh, then there's like Felix the cat, and there's, oh, oh, you know, all these

750
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,420
other cats, right?

751
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,720
Felix the cat is great though.

752
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,760
But then I thought about Garfield, and that made me think about Garfield minus Garfield.

753
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
Have you seen this cartoon?

754
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,400
Yes, I have.

755
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,800
It's the best thing ever.

756
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
They're more funny.

757
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
Yeah, exactly.

758
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Because, like, Garfield's not funny.

759
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,140
But if you take out Garfield, it's actually really funny.

760
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,140
And there's this blog.

761
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,000
All the ones with normal.

762
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,800
There's this blog all about it.

763
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,160
It's garfield minus garfield dot t-u-m-b-l-r dot com.

764
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,920
Whatever happened to our website of the week segment?

765
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,940
It became the classic video game of the week segment.

766
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,940
You know what?

767
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,840
We need to just, just for a minute here.

768
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,600
I'm hijacking the website of the week segment.

769
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,520
My website of the week is garfield minus garfield dot t-u-m-b-l-r dot com.

770
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Check it out.

771
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
It's hilarity.

772
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,120
Maybe you'll link it in the chat room for people.

773
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,840
Oh, sure, I'll do that for you guys right now.

774
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
Sorry live listeners.

775
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
There you go.

776
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:02,840
Anyway, sorry, there's your completely random off the subject tangent for tonight.

777
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,640
There you go.

778
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,160
Sorry.

779
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,680
No, it's okay.

780
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,320
Network problems, random tangents, sickness, this show has it all tonight.

781
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,000
Before you broke off on that whole Garfield thing, I was starting to say that Sonic and

782
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,720
his friends are kind of reminding me of Godzilla and the other monsters.

783
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,360
They had the staple monsters that they made and then they just started getting ridiculous

784
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,880
with the monsters, just not even trying.

785
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,840
I'm sure that someday they'd have a giant guy in underwear with broccoli on his head

786
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,080
or something like that and call it some fucking monster or whatever.

787
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,560
That's how ridiculous it is to get him.

788
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,200
Stop making Sonic characters and make some better Sonic games.

789
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,640
Hopefully this one is a little bit better.

790
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
I don't know.

791
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,160
Broccoli Man sounds kind of funny.

792
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,560
I mean, that's where the Mega Man series was going.

793
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,720
Perfect example, perfect example.

794
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
Broccoli Man.

795
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Right.

796
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:13,680
Well, if you're on a weight loss kick like most of the people it seems like nowadays,

797
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,760
then you'll be interested in this title.

798
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,160
It's a game or I guess a piece of software for the DS called Might Weight Loss Coach

799
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,800
and it features a pedometer that will actually plug into your Game Boy Advance slot.

800
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,760
So basically you wear this pedometer around and it will actually track how much you're

801
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,800
exercising throughout the day or how much you're jiggling I guess and then track your

802
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,520
progress throughout the DS title.

803
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:49,880
And I'm not sure if they also have some exercises or something that talks you through, but I

804
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,220
guess that's kind of neat.

805
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,220
Kind of.

806
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,220
A little bit.

807
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,220
I guess.

808
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,200
It just shows the DS can do even more.

809
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,440
Now it's a meter that you can measure how far you've walked in a day.

810
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
Hooray.

811
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,640
Well, the PSP users get this game called WTF.

812
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,360
Have you ever played WTF?

813
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
Uh-huh.

814
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
It's kind of fun.

815
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
I love WTF.

816
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,880
Well, you get WTF on the PSP and now on the DS you're going to get LOL.

817
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,880
That's right.

818
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,880
Actually these two games are completely unrelated.

819
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,800
They just both have funny titles.

820
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,400
The DS is getting a game called LOL and it's being made by a company called H-Tech.

821
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,580
They are bringing LOL to the Nintendo DS.

822
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,960
Basically what happens, somebody in the room will write a challenge on their DS like for

823
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,040
instance the screenshot I'm looking at says draw panda bear and then within a time limit

824
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,640
everybody else in the room has to draw, it sounds like Pictionary to me, and then everybody

825
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,040
votes on the winner and then you go to the next challenge.

826
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Okay.

827
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,680
So at first this sounded cool because it reminded me a lot of apples to apples where you would

828
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,880
do something like that.

829
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,560
But then I just started looking at this and thinking about it, can't you do this already

830
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
in PictoChat?

831
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,520
I mean, couldn't you, I don't know, do the exact same thing just with a little egg timer?

832
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,720
Or better yet, here's the thing.

833
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,960
Here's how you can play LOL without even a Nintendo DS.

834
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,880
It's called pen and paper.

835
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,280
Whoa, so what do I need to do this?

836
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,240
You would actually need to get some pens and some paper.

837
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,480
Now can I use any type of pens or certain pens will work for this?

838
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,880
Probably like a pen that would show up, like you wouldn't want to use a pink pen because

839
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,080
that's kind of hard to see unless you want to go for LOL value.

840
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,800
But make sure you have pen, and the paper, it could be lined paper or grid paper or blank

841
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,800
paper.

842
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,320
If people do insist on having it in a virtual environment, open Canvas.

843
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,640
Hi, you can network on open Canvas and everyone can draw on the same picture.

844
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,640
Now what do we need to do to get the word out about this pen and paper?

845
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,640
That Yahoo!

846
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,640
Chat thingy with the draw board is hilarious.

847
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,600
Or freakin' Oikaki, do that.

848
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,040
I really think you're onto something with this pen and paper.

849
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,040
I'm not sure, though.

850
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,040
I know, I'm telling you.

851
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,280
Look, think of what OLR Productions has come up with in the scope of just a few weeks.

852
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,960
We have Forbidden Bomberman, we have the pen and paper version of LOL, which we can totally

853
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,120
undercut these guys putting it out on DS, and remember, we're the ones that thought

854
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,840
of Laser Cats the game.

855
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
True.

856
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,300
I'm telling you, EA's going to buy us tomorrow.

857
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,400
It's just a matter of time.

858
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Just a matter of time.

859
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,240
And oh, how we'll sell.

860
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,360
Let's have tea and chat says, pen and paper is the wave of the future.

861
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,480
Yeah.

862
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:49,480
So how about the wave of the future that is actually not necessarily in ours anytime soon?

863
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,280
Guess who else is getting Wii Fit before us?

864
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
Let's see.

865
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,680
How about, I don't know, what's a country we don't hear about very often in the news?

866
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,680
How about...

867
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,680
Slovakia.

868
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,680
Sure.

869
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,940
How about the country of Chad in Africa?

870
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,720
Is Chad getting the game before we are?

871
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,560
No, but they're getting it in Australia.

872
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,320
Chad ruined our elections.

873
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Same thing.

874
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
Right?

875
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,320
Chad, Australia.

876
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,320
What's the difference?

877
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Australia is cool.

878
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,320
I'm just kidding.

879
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,320
I love Australia.

880
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,320
Of course I do.

881
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,160
And we did get Priscilla, Queen of the Desert from them.

882
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
That's true.

883
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,800
One of my favorite movies ever is Muriel's Wedding.

884
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,320
I have to say.

885
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
And Olivia Newton-John.

886
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Anyway.

887
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:31,880
Although, I bet most people who live in Australia would tell us there's plenty more to appreciate

888
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,840
about Australia than just those things.

889
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,840
And they gave us Kylie.

890
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,840
I don't know.

891
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,840
The opera house.

892
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,840
They did give us Kylie.

893
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,840
They gave us Kylie.

894
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,680
We had to test it on kangaroos before it's safe for Americans to use because we're very

895
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,680
kangaroo-like.

896
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,480
So, what's coming out in...

897
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,800
And act deaf, hit the nail on the head.

898
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,680
Without Australia, you would never have the dingo ate my baby.

899
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,760
You would never have that.

900
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,760
Or the didgeridoo techno.

901
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Exactly.

902
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,720
Let's take a moment to salute our Australian fans and their history.

903
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,720
Their great history.

904
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,080
Thank you, Australia.

905
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,080
For Moeller.

906
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,080
Opera house.

907
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,320
So, see, Australia, because of their greatness and contributions to culture, they get the

908
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
game a little early.

909
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,480
I thought that was very nice of Nintendo to do.

910
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,480
Right.

911
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,600
Well, anyway, they're getting it on May 8th.

912
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,720
We're getting ours on May 19th.

913
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,420
And it should be coming out for $150 Australian, which is...

914
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,560
The equivalent is 140 here, or 91 euro.

915
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,200
It's already sold over a million units.

916
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,000
Our dollar went to shit, didn't it?

917
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,560
Our dollar really, really went to shit sometime in the past couple years, didn't it?

918
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,200
You know, if it gets any worse, we're going to have to start calling it pesos.

919
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,200
Oh my God.

920
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,200
Sorry.

921
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,360
So, you know, I could go to Europe and I could work.

922
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:58,720
I could go to Europe like people from Mexico come here to earn money and come back rich.

923
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,200
That'd be great.

924
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,880
Anyway, like I was saying, it's already sold over a million units in Japan.

925
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:13,320
It's coming out on April 25th in Europe for 69.99 pounds in the UK and 89.99 euro everywhere

926
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,400
else in Europe.

927
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,280
And we're getting it on the 19th of May.

928
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,160
So that gets the whatever award for me, but I don't know.

929
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,800
Congratulations, Australia.

930
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,040
You've beat out Europe and America.

931
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,080
Kudos to you.

932
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,120
We're just trying to make it fair, I guess.

933
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,120
I don't know.

934
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
Karpat can ask a question.

935
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,040
What is the capital of Australia?

936
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,040
Sydney?

937
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,040
Nope.

938
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,680
That's the most common mistake.

939
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,680
But like, see, I could...

940
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,680
I know it's not Sydney.

941
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,680
It's Canberra.

942
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,920
But here's the thing is that, but you could do the same thing is that like, quick Australian

943
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,920
listeners.

944
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,680
What's the capital of Florida?

945
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,960
How many of you said Miami?

946
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,960
It's not.

947
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,960
It's not.

948
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,960
It's Tallahassee.

949
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Right.

950
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
Just saying.

951
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,800
Miami is the capital of where old folks go to die.

952
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,800
And Miami is also the capital of cocaine.

953
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,960
Come on.

954
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,960
I'm kidding.

955
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,960
Love Miami.

956
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,960
Love you guys.

957
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,560
When have you been to Miami?

958
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Wow, tonight.

959
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,440
Actually, I went to their airport once on my way to Jamaica.

960
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:24,000
I have been to Miami thousands of times thanks to the power of television.

961
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,280
I've actually been to Miami once and I was two years old.

962
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,160
Yeah, see, and SSG 100 Man has a perfect example.

963
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,840
You ask people what the capital of California is, hello, we live there, and most people

964
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
don't know.

965
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,320
If you say Los Angeles, then you need to get your head out of your ass, because Los Angeles...

966
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,320
Hey, wait a minute.

967
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,840
You said Sydney was the capital of Australia.

968
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,080
Get your head out of your ass.

969
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,120
But I don't live there, so I have an excuse.

970
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,200
Or get your ass out of your head, because it's Australia.

971
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Get it upside down.

972
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,200
Get it.

973
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,200
And the toilet splashed backwards.

974
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,760
What the hell happened to tonight's show?

975
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,160
It's just, it's just, it's just not right.

976
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,680
I'm going to keep going then.

977
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,680
Please do.

978
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,680
Please.

979
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,480
It's coming out here in May pretty soon.

980
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,540
I'm pretty psyched about it.

981
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,080
It's called Blastworks.

982
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,280
Originally, it was Tamiki Fighters.

983
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,720
Of course, now it's been, it's very little like Tamiki Fighters now.

984
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,880
But still the same kind of concept.

985
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,680
What's kind of neat about it, though, is you'll actually, of course, the game has like about

986
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,200
20 different levels you can play and stuff, and plays a little bit like Katamari meets,

987
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,280
you know, a really intense shooter game.

988
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,800
But now you'll be able to design completely new ships, new levels, new enemies, new AI

989
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,800
patterns, and new bullet patterns.

990
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,560
So I mean, completely customizable, and you can share all this content over WeConnect24,

991
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,560
which is pretty cool.

992
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,960
So some of the levels, I guess, they were just showing off to like Joystick, for example.

993
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,620
One of them looked like the environment was made out of paper, and you're actually flying

994
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:53,500
a paper airplane and fighting other paper airplanes and origamies, enemies and stuff

995
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
like that.

996
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,200
So really cool stuff.

997
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:02,160
Plus the game itself also has unlockable versions of Tamiki Fighters and some of the other games

998
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,320
made by Kent Ducho.

999
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,680
And if you're interested in checking out Tamiki Fighters, it's actually available for free

1000
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,440
on his website.

1001
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,180
Just do a search for Tamiki Fighters and definitely check it out.

1002
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:22,600
The game is slated to come out in the US in May, and I can't wait to check it out.

1003
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,480
Well this actually sounds kind of cool.

1004
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,400
It's kind of interesting that a game like this, it's kind of a, I wouldn't call this

1005
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,200
like a AAA title by any means, I mean it's based off an indie game, but kind of has all

1006
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,000
these features that we've been really waiting for on a lot of Wii games on it.

1007
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,680
Yeah, it looks really cool, and actually the four games that you can unlock in it are Rootage,

1008
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,640
Gunroar, Taurus Trooper, and of course the original Tamiki Fighters.

1009
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,400
So that's pretty cool, and I think this is going to be one of those games that a lot

1010
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,620
of people aren't going to know about, you know, it's one of those under-the-radar games.

1011
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,960
Is it going to be one of those under-the-radar costs, where it's only $20, or do we know

1012
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,020
a price point on this yet?

1013
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,320
If I remember correctly, I think it was like $39.99.

1014
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,040
So it's kind of your typical Wii, well, one step below your AAA Wii titles basically.

1015
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,100
But I mean, I think the value's pretty good, I mean if it was just going to be a straight

1016
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:14,000
port of Tamiki Fighters, it might be a little high, but with all the user-created stuff,

1017
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,040
I mean you can get pretty crazy with this game, so it'll be fun.

1018
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,160
Very good gaming story to bring us back from our capitals of the world discussion, I appreciate

1019
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,160
that.

1020
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,540
He's always working hard for O.L.R., isn't he?

1021
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,540
Very good.

1022
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,540
Yes.

1023
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:34,440
But yeah, definitely there's some video footage that looks like it's on GameTrailers.com,

1024
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,560
and they also have some links on Joystiq, you know, definitely check out the trailer

1025
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,560
if you can.

1026
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,800
If you've never played this game, do yourself a favor and play it, because it's really fun.

1027
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,000
At least Tamiki Fighters is.

1028
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Alright.

1029
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,940
Well, speaking of traveling the world and the capitals of the world, let's talk about

1030
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,480
what's coming out in Tokyo soon, because that is the capital of Japan.

1031
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,400
But actually, this will be the entirety of Japan, is getting these releases.

1032
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:06,080
This week in gaming, on March 19th, they are getting on the Xbox 360 Armored Core for Answer,

1033
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:14,240
Army of Two, Blazing Angels 2, Need for Speed Pro Street, Sengoku Mosu 2, and that's quite

1034
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,360
a few Xbox 360 games for one week.

1035
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,280
There you go.

1036
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,400
OddOne in chat says this is a favorite part of the show, Rob butchering the Japanese releases.

1037
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,040
That's why I read them, because I can't pronounce any of them.

1038
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,960
PlayStation 3, I can pronounce Armored Core.

1039
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,960
That's easy enough.

1040
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,320
PlayStation 3 also gets Armored Core, also gets Army of Two, also gets Blazing Angels

1041
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:39,360
2, but gets another game, Folk Soul, Unishanweta Densho.

1042
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,880
You might just know that as Folklore, but that's actually getting a price reduction

1043
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,500
that's already been out there, it's just a price reduction.

1044
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:51,620
Also getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3, Resistance, Ridge Racer 7, which I can't

1045
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,760
pronounce, and Mobile Suit Gundam, Target Insight, all getting price reductions this

1046
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,920
week.

1047
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,920
And cheaper games is never bad news.

1048
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,840
On the Nintendo Wii, speaking of price reductions, Bomberland Wii is moving in to the best, but

1049
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,400
some new games coming out, Spider-Man 3 just now coming out in Japan.

1050
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,680
I would suggest you just pass on that, but maybe you want to pick up the House of the

1051
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:18,040
Dead 2 and 3 with the Wii Zapper, also being sold independently there.

1052
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,720
Dekka Sporta also coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan.

1053
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:28,420
Moving on to the PlayStation 2, nothing really new coming out there, just some price reductions

1054
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,300
on The Godfather and Kamiwaza.

1055
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,280
Something to look forward to next week is the Metal Gear Solid collection, if you're

1056
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,280
looking out for that.

1057
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,000
Let's check out the handhelds, moving on to the Nintendo DS, Bangayo Spirits comes out

1058
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
this week in Japan.

1059
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yay!

1060
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,880
And Chonaketsu Koku Kunio-kun Dodge Ball comes out.

1061
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
Yay!

1062
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,280
This is going to be a fun week for Japan.

1063
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:58,040
Coming out from Konami, Kachushima Kosaku DS, Dikuru Otoko no Love and Success.

1064
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:05,000
SimCity DS 2 also comes out from EA on the Nintendo DS, and quickly glancing at the PSP

1065
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,820
to see if there's anything of note for you guys in Japan on there.

1066
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:13,640
Biohazard Trilogy Box, but that's the movies, sorry, not the games.

1067
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,740
But if you want that on your PSP, you can check that out.

1068
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:21,240
Also a port of Need for Speed Pro Street, and since Skype was recently released in Japan,

1069
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,880
I believe we covered that in last week's news, the PSP microphone is finally hitting the

1070
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,000
shelves this week in Japan.

1071
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So check it out.

1072
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,960
I want Kunio-kun Dodge Ball.

1073
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,120
Well, you can import it from one of your favorite import retails.

1074
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,520
Or if you wait a few months, it'll be coming out over here.

1075
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,520
So I want my Kunio-kun Dodge Ball, which we would, of course, know over here as Super

1076
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,080
Dodge Ball, because it was sweet.

1077
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,240
Those Dodge Ball games are awesome.

1078
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,280
I love all the Kunio games, they're so nice.

1079
00:56:51,280 --> 00:57:00,200
But anyway, for our friends overseas in the UK, I have some releases for you guys.

1080
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:07,440
On the 20th, CSI Crime Scene Investigation Hard Evidence on Wii, Mystery Dungeon Sheeran

1081
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,400
the Wanderer on DS, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, Sega Superstars Tennis on a bunch

1082
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:22,080
of stuff, Spin Out, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Victorious

1083
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:26,920
Boxers Challenge, and then we've got some games on the 21st.

1084
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,360
That would be Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fate.

1085
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:38,480
We have Off-Road for PS2, PC, and PSP, Samurai Warriors 2, Extreme Legends, and that's it.

1086
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,280
Very surprised no one mentioned Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fate in their

1087
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,280
gaming weeks.

1088
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,720
Because I heard the game came out, some of my friends picked it up, and have been raving

1089
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,720
about it.

1090
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,720
I didn't like Crystal Chronicles.

1091
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,880
I didn't either, but the DS version doesn't look quite like the GameCube one, so it might

1092
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,760
be worth a look, I don't know.

1093
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
I'm just curious.

1094
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,760
How about Chatters?

1095
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,440
Are Chatters picking it up?

1096
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,880
Post your reviews real quickly, I'll read some of them in a minute.

1097
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,720
In the US, we're getting a few things that are pretty interesting.

1098
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:13,200
This week, of course, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

1099
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,160
Sega Superstars Tennis coming out on almost everything, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3,

1100
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,720
Xbox 360, Wii, and the DS.

1101
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,960
The Metal Gear Solid Essentials Collection is coming out on PlayStation 2, if you want

1102
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:31,600
to relive some of those older Metal Gear games before number 4 comes out.

1103
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:37,080
Condemned 2 Bloodshot on PlayStation 3, apparently a week late.

1104
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,880
Hot Shots Golf Out of Bounds on PlayStation 3.

1105
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,120
Lost in Blue 3 on the DS.

1106
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,960
I'm still shocked that they actually got a third game in that series.

1107
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:53,040
I wouldn't be surprised if we see a fourth one either, or horn that thing to death.

1108
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,800
Kingstar 90's Edition is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.

1109
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:05,580
Samurai Warriors 2 Extreme Legends on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 via download.

1110
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:14,980
Some other fun stuff, Worms of Space Oddity on the Wii, Fantasy Aquarium on the DS, Go

1111
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:21,440
Pets Vacation Island on the DS, which looks really weird and kind of stupid looking, Pro

1112
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:27,080
Evolution Soccer 2008 on the Wii, that one also is a week late, George of the Jungle

1113
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:38,480
on PlayStation 2, Wii, and the DS, and let's see here, the PlayStation 3 version of Karaoke

1114
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,940
Revolution American Idol is finally coming out.

1115
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:52,120
That totally delayed for about a month now, and let's see, I believe that's it.

1116
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:57,480
Next week though, the week after next, I should say, and I can't wait for this, Crisis Core,

1117
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:02,360
Final Fantasy VII for the PSP.

1118
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:09,960
All right, well, moving on, talking about something recently hitting the US, DDR, you

1119
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:10,960
remember DDR?

1120
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:22,240
Our whole show used to be about DDR, and DDR is still going, obviously we get phone calls

1121
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,000
from folks on Skype once in a while, why don't you love Bomani like you used to, then we

1122
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,320
have to say, because it hasn't changed, well anyhow, actually, DDR is changing a little

1123
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,320
bit.

1124
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,000
E-Amusement, you've heard of this before, E-Amusement is a system they have in Japan

1125
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,240
where you basically have these little cars, picture, y'all know, if you've been in the

1126
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,320
arcade, y'all know Initial D, right, how you have the cards, picture something like

1127
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,760
that but on a DDR machine, where you can kind of save your high scores, but it's also hooked

1128
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,920
into the internet, and so you can have these global leaderboards and all this stuff.

1129
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,240
Well, guess what, the E-Amusement system finally, after all these years, is hitting America.

1130
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
That was damn time.

1131
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,920
And this is coming from an official Konami website, DDROnlineCommunity.com is their website,

1132
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,080
and it's got the Konami logos and all that fun stuff, is they are announcing that Naperville,

1133
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,360
Illinois of all places, because when I think of arcade gaming, I think of Naperville, Illinois,

1134
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:15,000
but this must be one hella good arcade, Brunswick Zone is the arcade, is going to be getting

1135
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,120
the E-Amusement system, and come to think of it, this is an arcade that usually does

1136
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:22,080
a lot of the beta tests for DDR, so I'm not surprised, it's just kind of funny that, you

1137
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,440
know, ground zero for DDR evolution.

1138
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,440
I'm not sure, because I don't know too much about Bedson, but maybe it's close to one

1139
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,720
of Bedson's distribution centers, something like that, maybe, I don't know, I'm just guessing.

1140
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,480
Brunswick makes me think of bowling.

1141
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,520
I know, I think Brunswick did make bowling stuff.

1142
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,520
They make bowling pins.

1143
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,560
They might do entertainment stuff, you know, in other places.

1144
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,560
But anyhow, and as Konami says on the site, it's the new online service which connects

1145
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,360
arcade locations in North America via the internet.

1146
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,440
Arcade players can compete with each other, review their ranking, tournament results,

1147
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,120
save the play data, and more.

1148
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,180
Konami will expand this new level service nationwide with Brunswick Bowling and Billiards.

1149
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,760
So coming to a bowling alley near you, there you have it.

1150
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,200
Now my question is, is this enough to make you interested in DDR again?

1151
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Maybe.

1152
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,200
I say not really.

1153
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,360
I kind of miss the old internet ranking that we had back in the day.

1154
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,600
Oh yeah, that was old school.

1155
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:22,040
But yeah, I mean, besides the fact that I do miss DDR a little bit for the nostalgia

1156
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:26,040
value, here's the reason why I don't think this is exactly the kick in the butt in the

1157
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:30,680
community that DDR's kind of needed for about, oh, four years now, is that the internet's

1158
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,120
already been doing this long before Konami decided to officially endorse it.

1159
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,120
Right?

1160
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,200
This has been going on since, like, Fourth Mix.

1161
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,200
That's, you know, those sites, like, what are those tracking sites for DDR?

1162
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,760
I mean, they've come and gone.

1163
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,040
That's how long those things have been around.

1164
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,080
Well, it didn't a long time ago, and it was built in the Fourth Mix.

1165
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:51,000
They had a code that you could write down that you could go onto the website and plug

1166
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,560
it in, and there's your internet rankings.

1167
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,880
And I understand this is a little more fluid than that system, but, you know, I'm just

1168
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,360
thinking of those websites where, you know, you could type in your scores, like, they

1169
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,000
have them for all types of music games.

1170
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,880
You type in your scores, what letter grade you got on it, and, you know, you can get

1171
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,020
a little signature banner, and it's basically like, you know, here's how big your E-penis

1172
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:14,240
is because I passed all these DDR songs.

1173
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,080
And then somebody could challenge you if they thought you were lying about your score, blah

1174
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,080
blah blah blah blah.

1175
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,080
I think it's cool.

1176
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,080
Um, what's...

1177
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,720
GS68 says VJ Army.

1178
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,440
Yeah, like that, but DDR.

1179
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,240
There was one for DDR they had.

1180
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,240
Here's what they need to do.

1181
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,400
And this would be pretty cool, uh, is, I don't know, you could have, like, certain, you know,

1182
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,960
teams or whatever that you, I guess, associate yourself with.

1183
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,520
I don't know how many, like, different colors or whatever.

1184
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,480
And then you could say, like, you play different arcades around, you know, the country or the

1185
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,400
world or whatever, and you kind of capture them, and they become, like, you know, blue

1186
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,800
or whatever, or red or whatever your color is.

1187
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,020
And then, kind of like, remember how they had with Soul Calibur?

1188
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,020
I think it was Soul Calibur.

1189
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,020
Yeah, yeah.

1190
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,020
That was fun.

1191
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,020
Yeah.

1192
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,020
That's what I'm talking about.

1193
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:58,020
Making DDR a more competitive game, right?

1194
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:59,020
Yeah.

1195
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:04,040
That's what I've been saying for five years on this program that DDRs needed to do.

1196
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,280
There is innovation sitting in there in the game.

1197
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,960
Just make DDR more competitive as opposed to cooperative game.

1198
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,720
You could make a whole new game out of it and really kick some butt in the franchise,

1199
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,720
but nobody's listening.

1200
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,400
What they need to do, and I'm not sure who's in charge of the DDR games, is they need to

1201
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,600
get someone new in charge of the DDR games.

1202
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:28,840
DDR Recall, says Akdeft, was the name of what I was trying to think of earlier, thank you.

1203
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,840
There it is.

1204
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:35,320
Anyhow, so those of you that are still playing DDR, and I know we have a lot of DDR fans

1205
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,600
at least, I'm not trying to knock DDR, I mean, obviously, it's still a great game because

1206
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,600
it keeps you physical and everything.

1207
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:44,240
Hey, if I had the money and the room, I'd be buying a machine for my house, okay, so

1208
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,240
whatever.

1209
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,240
I'd still be playing that.

1210
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:50,700
It just frustrates me that they won't innovate the damn game.

1211
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,320
I just don't have time to make it down to arcades anymore, so.

1212
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:57,520
I'll say it one more time, if anybody happens to be listening, and I know we have folks

1213
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:03,000
on the inside that listen to this show once in a great while, nuke your code, build something

1214
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,720
from the ground up, innovate in the process, watch money flow in.

1215
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,080
And stop, for the love of God, I know that you like doing these other modes like the

1216
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:17,660
fitness mode and that kind of shit, you don't need to go that crazy with this stuff, I mean,

1217
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:22,080
I think they've made it too user friendly, too simple, you know what I mean?

1218
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,520
I don't think you need a training mode in every single DDR game, because I know I didn't

1219
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:32,800
need a training mode to play the damn game, I learned just fine by playing the damn game.

1220
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,160
Let's move on.

1221
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,160
Can we?

1222
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,160
Yes.

1223
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:44,760
Well, there is more news out there that will make iPhone owners happy, including myself.

1224
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:51,520
There are going to be some game releases, including Pac-Man and Galaga, and that makes

1225
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,720
me very happy.

1226
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,720
Also...

1227
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,920
Sorry, go ahead.

1228
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:02,160
Also bejeweled, so I guess it's, I mean, Zuma and Pagle, which I don't really give a crap

1229
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,240
about, I just care about Pac-Man and Galaga.

1230
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,960
Pagle is really awesome, actually.

1231
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,960
Is it?

1232
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,960
Yes.

1233
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,960
Oh thank God, I can play Pac-Man!

1234
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,200
I wonder if you play with your finger.

1235
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,640
Can't you play pretty much all these games on the iPod anyway?

1236
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,200
Including Pagle?

1237
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,840
Which is actually one of the better, I think the iPod was made for Pagle, it's awesome.

1238
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,240
From what I hear it sucks, like Bejeweled you have to cycle through all the gems and

1239
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,560
stuff using the little, whatever the fuck they call that thing, scroll wheel, touch

1240
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,200
wheel, gay wheel, whatever.

1241
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,520
The whole screen is touch screen.

1242
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,120
It's just, I don't know.

1243
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:44,040
I think you should just be able to poke whichever one and then poke the one next to it.

1244
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,320
I think Bejeweled would be good on it.

1245
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,120
I think that would work pretty well.

1246
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,400
I'm surprised they haven't put Bejeweled on the DS yet.

1247
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:54,440
I mean, they really, fuck, put a PopCap collection on the DS.

1248
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,680
Watch how much that sells.

1249
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,800
You know what else would work out?

1250
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,440
You know what other games would work really well on the iPhone?

1251
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,040
New things.

1252
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,440
New games.

1253
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,840
Things that haven't been thought of yet.

1254
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,560
New stuff.

1255
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,320
We have this game that we would like to pitch.

1256
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,920
It's called Pen and Paper.

1257
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:18,240
You can use the iPhone as paper and you can write stuff with your stylus, which is the

1258
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,240
pen.

1259
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,960
Yes, and here's one.

1260
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,880
It's based off a popular Saturday Night Live sketch and you have cats and they have lasers

1261
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,320
attached to their heads and where you touch on the screen you shoot lasers at dogs and

1262
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:34,120
people and sometimes other laser cats in multiplayer mode.

1263
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,320
I just had a random thought pop into my head.

1264
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,320
What's that?

1265
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,880
I had a different video game experience this week but that was watching the Family Guy

1266
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,280
Star Wars special.

1267
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,840
Did it feel like a game or something?

1268
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:50,080
No, they were going into an asteroid field and it was asteroids.

1269
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,680
Nice.

1270
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,200
Anyway.

1271
01:07:53,200 --> 01:08:02,400
So, apparently the Chinese Olympics website has been accused of game piracy.

1272
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:06,920
Apparently they have been stealing some Flash games that they feature on the website and

1273
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:13,040
kind of changing them just a little bit but they're still blatantly stealing them.

1274
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:20,120
According to the creator of these Flash games, Caden Batrick, who noticed some very similar

1275
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:26,440
similarities with different games like Fua Fights, The Olympic Clouds, which is very

1276
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,680
similar to his Snow Day game that he has.

1277
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:33,160
Also there are some other ones that were also very similar.

1278
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:41,760
Of course, these have been removed from the Olympic sites as of last Monday but there

1279
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:47,960
are still a couple of games that are on there that may be stolen from some other websites

1280
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,120
as well.

1281
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,960
As if we didn't need more reasons to say the Olympics suck.

1282
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,720
Odd One has an interesting comment in chat that says, wait, aren't most Flash games rip

1283
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:05,400
offs of each other or classic games, seriously, the Flash arena is rife with IP theft and

1284
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,400
copying.

1285
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,400
True, they are, but this I think was like blatant.

1286
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:15,400
I mean, just like, if you made like a Super Mario Brothers game but instead you changed

1287
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:20,420
it to, I don't know, a female chicken or something like that, that would be a blatant ripoff

1288
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:23,680
of Mario Brothers.

1289
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:27,160
And I don't know, you called it like Chick Sisters or something like that.

1290
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,280
Wasn't that the PETA game?

1291
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,600
Oh yes, that was!

1292
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,400
That's right, yeah, blatant ripoff.

1293
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,200
Not really, though, because the level design was totally different, but yeah, I get what

1294
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,200
you're saying.

1295
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,200
Yeah, it was crap.

1296
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,200
Made me hungry for chicken, though.

1297
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,200
Alright.

1298
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:45,840
And really, who goes to the Chinese Olympics website to play Flash games?

1299
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,320
I mean, are people that bored?

1300
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,920
I don't think so.

1301
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,200
Good question.

1302
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:58,960
Well, we're just about done with part A tonight, but first off we have to read about our stupid

1303
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,240
person of the week.

1304
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,720
And actually, I don't know, this isn't so much stupid, it's just kind of sad.

1305
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,360
I don't really know how else to say it, so let's cue some music to read this very sad

1306
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:13,440
story.

1307
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:23,600
A 15-year-old boy in the Austin area of Austin, Texas, got killed, gunshot wound to the head.

1308
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,720
The boy was playing a video game and his friend just shot him in the head, 13-year-old shooter

1309
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:35,360
shoots his 15-year-old friend in the head over a video game, I suppose is what the story

1310
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,600
is trying to say, because they do make a mention at the very end of this story.

1311
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,240
The boys were playing a video game, the game was called God of War.

1312
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:50,760
Oh yes, because there's tons of gun violence in God of War.

1313
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:56,920
Thank you so much to these kids for giving Gamers Everywhere a wonderful name.

1314
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,920
How are the parents?

1315
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,920
Where?

1316
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,640
Out buying more ammo, of course.

1317
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,480
Okay, I don't see how, there's no way they're going to be able to tie that to the game,

1318
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,480
because there's no fucking guns in God of War.

1319
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,480
At all.

1320
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,480
Zero.

1321
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,000
It just sucks.

1322
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,800
I mean, it's not funny, it's sad, it's just kids shooting each other, but you've got to

1323
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,640
wonder, where did the kid learn to shoot someone else, where did the kid learn to load a gun?

1324
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,640
Maybe it was already loaded.

1325
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,640
It's not that hard to load a gun.

1326
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,640
Well, it's just sad.

1327
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,640
It's not that hard to pull a trigger, either.

1328
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,320
All right, well let's try to make the show a little better, and for that we're going

1329
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,960
to turn to Dark Sakura to help us out a little bit.

1330
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,000
Dark Sakura, do you think you can help make our show a little better tonight?

1331
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I could.

1332
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,300
All right, well she's going to do that by sharing with us her pick for a classic video

1333
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,320
game to pay some respect to.

1334
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:58,120
It's called Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1335
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,600
And what game did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?

1336
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:08,440
The game I picked was actually a series of games called The Last Blade, which was a Neo

1337
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,400
Geo game put out by SNK.

1338
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:19,760
I actually have the Dreamcast Last Blade 2 myself, and it's such a really, really good

1339
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,800
2D fighter, I mean really, really good.

1340
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:31,240
It's set around in...

1341
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,240
I would have to...

1342
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:39,320
I'm not really exactly when the exact time frame is in Japan, because there's references

1343
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:46,620
to the Shinsengumi, to fighting for the Shogun, so I would assume it's right.

1344
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,800
And from what I can tell from the characters in the game, it's sort of right around that

1345
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,800
transitional period.

1346
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:56,500
But it's really just, you've got people who use different weapons.

1347
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:04,800
One of the guys who worked on Guilty Gear actually helped develop this game, too.

1348
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,440
And it's really, really good.

1349
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:14,000
You've also got your choice of using power or speed, so you can have a stronger, slower

1350
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,360
character, you can have someone who's weaker, but faster.

1351
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:22,200
And of course, you've got your attacks and combos that incorporate all of that.

1352
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:28,400
I just really think that it's a very nice game, and one of the other things that it

1353
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:37,520
brought into it was a deflect, where you could block a move, and then you would be able to

1354
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,800
instantly attack.

1355
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,560
So I thought that was a pretty neat function, as well.

1356
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:51,520
Also, Last Blade was the first SNK game to bring in Super Campus into its gameplay.

1357
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:57,840
And you've got desperation moves, super moves, all kinds of stuff, it's just really, really

1358
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,840
a fun game.

1359
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,080
The series is fun.

1360
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:06,440
And the thing I like about it, too, is that the music is pretty, I guess, almost on the

1361
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,400
classical end, and one of the things that I really liked about it, and this is going

1362
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:15,800
to sound kind of cheeseball, is that when you go into each stage, you sort of have a

1363
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:21,600
little cutscene in the top corner that sets up the area you're playing in.

1364
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,440
And I think it's really cool, not just for the story, the characters themselves, but

1365
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,520
the environments in the game.

1366
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,640
And the explosive blood!

1367
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,680
I love the little fatality-type things they do there, I just saw one in the little, like...

1368
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,640
Look, this is the perfect successor to the Samurai Shodown series.

1369
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,640
Very nice.

1370
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,080
It's just a lot of fun.

1371
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,680
Lots of approval from the chat room on your pick tonight, DarkSakura.

1372
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:51,160
I believe Footy in chat said it was his favorite 2D fighter ever.

1373
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,160
Yeah.

1374
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,160
Ever.

1375
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,160
Oh, sorry.

1376
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:59,640
I was going to say, there was, I'm trying to remember the character that I played the

1377
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,840
most, because I played the one who dressed up as her brother.

1378
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,600
And I don't remember the character.

1379
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,600
You played a cross-dresser?

1380
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,040
Yes, I did.

1381
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:16,160
I was going to say, there was another game that's out there, that sold 1 point, or, uh...

1382
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,560
It was Kojiro, sorry.

1383
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:24,240
Point one eight million now for, uh, Eye of Judgment.

1384
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,740
Never gonna happen.

1385
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,240
Never gonna happen.

1386
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:34,240
All right, well, there you have it, tonight's classic game of the week, The Last Blade.

1387
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,920
Just the whole damn series.

1388
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,920
On every platform.

1389
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,920
Neo Geo, Dreamcast.

1390
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:38,920
There's one on Dreamcast, right?

1391
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,920
There's Dreamcast.

1392
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,560
I believe that there were PS2 versions.

1393
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,800
I do want to say that there were, but of course, the Dreamcast one was, like, beautiful.

1394
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,760
All right, so we'll say the Dreamcast version, then, because you're such a Dreamcast fan.

1395
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,040
I love Dreamcast.

1396
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,040
Really everything.

1397
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,800
All right, so check that out, The Last Blade.

1398
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,320
Uh, that's going to bring our part A to a close tonight, so we're going to take a break,

1399
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:06,480
and we'll be back, though, never fear, with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1400
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,880
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice
