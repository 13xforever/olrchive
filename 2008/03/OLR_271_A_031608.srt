1
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:24,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, March 16th, 2008, Tetris and Bomberman are WiiWare bound, E-Amuse hits the DDR scene in North America, and are the rumors about a Blu-ray drive on the 360 true?

2
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:33,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

3
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:35,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,984
[SPEAKER_00]: We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:44,186
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week.

6
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:47,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Also here with you every week, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:48,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

8
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:49,730
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, Ms.

9
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Summers?

10
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:53,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm completely enamored with what I'm looking at.

11
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,333
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking at, pray tell?

12
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:56,213
[SPEAKER_04]: A melodica.

13
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:57,153
[SPEAKER_00]: A melodica.

14
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:59,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you shopping for musical instruments online tonight?

15
00:00:59,294 --> 00:00:59,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I am.

16
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:06,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Did last week's techno didgeridoo inspire you to come up with an underappreciated instrument of your own?

17
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:11,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I actually have, there's a few instruments that I personally want to own myself.

18
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:17,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them is a melodica, which is like a keyboard, but you play it like with the mouthpiece.

19
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:18,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

20
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:21,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it sounds sort of like a harmonica, but not quite.

21
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:26,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want an auto-harp.

22
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:28,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun.

23
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I used to play auto-harp when I was little.

24
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,268
[SPEAKER_00]: What about kazoo?

25
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:35,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Is kazoo not satisfying to anyone anymore?

26
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:36,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the problem?

27
00:01:36,589 --> 00:01:36,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

28
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:38,689
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife auto-harps.

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hello to the smartass over there, Techmaster Loki.

30
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:44,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

31
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,331
[SPEAKER_00]: So your wife auto-harps, huh?

32
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:46,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

33
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:47,511
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice to know.

34
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:48,731
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

35
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to tell her to complain at all.

36
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:52,417
[SPEAKER_02]: She just does it on her own.

37
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,219
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I get it.

39
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:56,482
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a joke in there.

40
00:01:57,443 --> 00:02:00,727
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are you otherwise this week, Techmaster Loki?

41
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:01,388
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay.

42
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:02,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

43
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you shopping for any musical instruments of your own?

44
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:04,852
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

45
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:05,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

46
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:06,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Just checking.

47
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:10,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, let's get into how we always start off the show.

48
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:14,194
[SPEAKER_00]: First, let me introduce the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

49
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:16,715
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several people in chat tonight.

50
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a smaller turnout, though, on the live stream than I've seen in recent weeks.

51
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:20,876
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure.

52
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something else going on tonight I'm not aware of?

53
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:26,558
[SPEAKER_00]: No more Grammy Awards, no Oscars, no Super Bowl.

54
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:26,978
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?

55
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:27,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.

56
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Go outside night?

57
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,260
[SPEAKER_00]: See Patty's Eve?

58
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

59
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maybe people are camping out outside the bars waiting for 6 a.m.

60
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:34,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

61
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:35,922
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

62
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:36,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, who knows?

63
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:49,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, we'll work with what we've got and also our little contingent over on Justin.TV on our feed there, which by the way, brand new addition to our Justin.TV arsenal.

64
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:58,692
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have a video capture card, so when we bring you clips of games, we'll actually, instead of having to point the camera at the TV, the little getaway, we'll actually be able to run the feed from the TV.

65
00:02:58,772 --> 00:02:59,573
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very exciting.

66
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:00,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy, happy, happy.

67
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:02,963
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

68
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:24,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Good time.

69
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:24,974
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

70
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:28,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Stern is releasing a new Indiana Jones pinball machine.

71
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dan said he'd even be willing to sell Creature of the Black Lagoon to obtain it.

72
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:34,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

73
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,808
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be expensive, though.

74
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:37,549
[SPEAKER_00]: A new machine?

75
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:38,530
[SPEAKER_00]: A brand new machine.

76
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,411
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are crazy.

77
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:42,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he said he might even let go of Simpsons Pinball Party.

78
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:43,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

79
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:44,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Ragnarok Scrabble

80
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't go on Facebook.

81
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:18,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook has a very Scrabble-like game.

82
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,499
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think they got in trouble for it.

83
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:23,761
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually an application called Scrabulous, is what it's called.

84
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:26,222
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can play Scrabble with friends on Facebook, basically.

85
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:31,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much as Facebook kind of bugs me, I do like being able to play Scrabble with friends online.

86
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:33,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's the same one.

87
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something that was linked to me.

88
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:39,109
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was doing the solitaire mode on it.

89
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:44,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you have to be a Facebook member to use Scrabulous, so it was probably something different.

90
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:52,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Facebook, but the last thing I actually did with it was through my phone when one of my friends in Mississippi found me in Facebook somehow and friended me.

91
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,802
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Jamie, I was just going to mention, I saw this earlier today and I thought of you guys.

92
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:02,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter 4, they're taking pre-orders on it right now for $2,590 with an $880 deposit.

93
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,134
[SPEAKER_02]: for the arcade hardware.

94
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:10,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for the machine.

95
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:11,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, for the game?

96
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:12,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

97
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:13,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

98
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:16,018
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

99
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,360
[SPEAKER_00]: But what kind of machine do you have to put that in?

100
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, normally the machines are $23,000.

101
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:25,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's probably, you know, but, I mean, come on, 2DX?

102
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:29,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, shit, that's just like a computer with like an HD screen attached to it and a sound system.

103
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:35,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, most of these things nowadays, you can probably hook it up to a TV and build your own control panel for it.

104
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's too sophisticated.

105
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:40,683
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to be able to run the... Well, let me know if you end up doing that, Jamie.

106
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:43,185
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty hardcore, but then again...

107
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Street Fighter IV Network ID Card vs. Communication Kit

108
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:39,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I only have $3,000 to throw around.

109
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:41,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I don't.

110
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:44,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably wouldn't spend it on Street Fighter 4 because I suck at Street Fighter.

111
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:48,356
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I would do if I had that much money?

112
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:51,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a down payment on a house and move.

113
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,658
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd need more than $3,000 for a down payment.

114
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking the cost of the cabinet.

115
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,740
[SPEAKER_02]: $23,000, that would cover it.

116
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:10,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this week I didn't play a whole lot, I just played basically N+, a few lunches I played that.

117
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:31,748
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fun, you know, it's just like N, and I think I'm like on the 10th level, but there's like 5 or 6 stages per level, so some of them are pretty hard, but that's N. And then the rest of the time I've been playing Smash Bros., but I've just basically been doing the Space Emissary mode, which...

118
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:34,685
[SPEAKER_02]: is varying levels of cool and crap.

119
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:35,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

120
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:44,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, sometimes I'm just like, oh, this is pretty good level design, and then some other times it's just like, uh, I don't know, this is pretty dumb.

121
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:49,290
[SPEAKER_02]: But, overall, I'm still playing it, and I'm only halfway through it.

122
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, a little over halfway through it.

123
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, other than that, I don't know.

124
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:57,472
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.

125
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,853
[SPEAKER_00]: How was M+, overall?

126
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:02,594
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what some folks in chat are asking.

127
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:14,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and plus, I like it, but I mean, it's not too different than just the regular N, except for the fact that, I don't know, different levels, that's it.

128
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:26,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well, uh, moving on to my gaming week, um, you know, I've actually been kind of sick this week, which you would think would make me want to stay home and play a lot of games, but it kind of, eh, I don't know, it kind of,

129
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:28,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucked my will to do a lot of things.

130
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:31,075
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been having these weird pains all over my side.

131
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:33,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get into all the nasty details about it.

132
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:39,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, doctors don't even know what it is, and I've taken medication that have caused now side effects, blah, blah, blah.

133
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,459
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sucks.

134
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,060
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I didn't play a lot of games because of it.

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I did play a few things, very random stuff.

136
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:47,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things I played were very random.

137
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:50,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Phantasy Star 2.

138
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:55,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to download on Virtual Console quite randomly, and I checked that out, and that was kind of cool.

139
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,842
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, although, you know, I don't know.

140
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:02,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Phantasy Star 2 wasn't quite as cool as Final Fantasy, but it was different.

141
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:03,986
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of cool.

142
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:07,790
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those games, because I never had a Genesis growing up, so it was kind of one of those games I missed.

143
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:17,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's kind of neat, though, now that I've played Phantasy Star online to kind of see some of the history of the Phantasy Star universe and see where a lot of that stuff has come from, so that's kind of cool.

144
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, let's see, what else have I checked out?

145
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, World of Warcraft, as always, you know, Addict and all that stuff.

146
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:25,184
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um,

147
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:30,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what else have I played this week?

148
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:31,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally drawing a blank.

149
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually skipped out on Lost Odyssey this week.

150
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:38,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I checked out Brain Challenge, that new Xbox Live Arcade game.

151
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looked dumb.

152
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:40,681
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of dumb.

153
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:42,702
[SPEAKER_00]: The minigames were kind of dumb.

154
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:47,204
[SPEAKER_00]: The minigames were just kind of... I don't know.

155
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:47,644
[SPEAKER_00]: It just...

156
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:54,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if you don't have Brain Age on the DS or I don't know, the whole novelty of these brain training games is really worn off.

157
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's face it, the market's been really oversaturated.

158
00:09:57,153 --> 00:10:00,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this is the only type of it available on the Xbox 360.

159
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:10,195
[SPEAKER_00]: If you must have a minigame collection for your very own on the Xbox 360, then you can go ahead and check that out.

160
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:13,495
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, it's really nothing to scream about.

161
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,396
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be that.

162
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:18,315
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really it for my gaming week.

163
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:43,363
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

164
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:16,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so this week they officially announced that Super Mario Kart Wii will be coming to the US on April 27th.

165
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:19,237
[SPEAKER_02]: That is two days before Grand Theft Auto 4.

166
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:24,982
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, I mean, people on the Wii, they don't get Grand Theft Auto 4, so you get Mario Kart Wii.

167
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:29,806
[SPEAKER_02]: No cars being stolen in this game, but, you know, it's still pretty violent.

168
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:35,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, some other cool stuff that you'll, of course, get the Wii wheel with this.

169
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:38,367
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will also be sold separately on the side.

170
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:56,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they're going to have 32 different courses up to 12 players online and media integration, 10 battle arenas and of course support for a bunch of different control methods much like Super Smash Bros.

171
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:56,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl.

172
00:11:58,491 --> 00:11:59,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty awesome.

173
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I plan on picking them both though.

174
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:08,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed some of the retro levels are making an appearance in Mario Kart.

175
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:09,549
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of interesting.

176
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are pretty cool.

177
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:16,213
[SPEAKER_02]: IGN actually had some footage of five levels that they had in their pre-release copy.

178
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you call it, Alpha or whatever.

179
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:25,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got Course 4 from the Super Nintendo Mario Kart.

180
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty awesome looking.

181
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:31,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they had a remake of the Block Fort from Nintendo 64.

182
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:34,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it looks a little different, though.

183
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:37,045
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a direct remake of it.

184
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:40,928
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a bunch of additional stuff on there, but it's still blocked for it.

185
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:44,690
[SPEAKER_02]: And then... Let's see what else was there.

186
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the ones I didn't play, though.

187
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:52,055
[SPEAKER_02]: They had one from the Game Boy Advance one, which I don't remember any of the battle modes in the Game Boy Advance one.

188
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:59,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also some from Double Dash and the DS one.

189
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,042
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be honest, Double Dash is...

190
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:08,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaded says, between that and Brawl, I can say goodbye to my bank account.

191
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to mispronounce this name, I apologize.

192
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:39,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Queltippo, I think that's how you say it, Queltippo, says the Wii wheel is about as useful as jamming the Wiimote into a giant pretzel.

193
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:43,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do that, too, as long as the pretzel is sideways.

194
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:48,358
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually use a pretzel as a Wii steering wheel.

195
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,439
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do that on the show, that would be fun.

196
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be kind of fun.

197
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, one thing that's not delicious... Mmm, yummy!

198
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:58,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do that.

199
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:04,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can also do the Wii Cinnabon and alternate controller methods.

200
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:06,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be sticky.

201
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:07,358
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of messy.

202
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:08,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You could use a hamburger bun.

203
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:09,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It's circular.

204
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:15,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, one thing that's not coming, though, to Mario Kart Wii is snaking.

205
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I'm very happy about that.

206
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:25,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, according to the official Nintendo magazine in the UK, snaking is gone.

207
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,632
[SPEAKER_02]: They've changed how the...

208
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:36,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Boosting is done, I guess, around corners and no longer will you be able to speed boost by waggling the controls left and right as you power slide.

209
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:42,600
[SPEAKER_02]: This has, I guess, been scrapped and now your speed boost is determined by how long you can hold the slide.

210
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure someone will find a different way to do it.

211
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it will be exploited one way or another.

212
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:48,683
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, that's kind of neat.

213
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:55,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, now, you know how our chat room works, and a little joke comes up, and then everybody exploits it best they can.

214
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:59,431
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Wii Churro, Wii Tortilla, Wii Hot Dog Bun.

215
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:05,314
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd actually kind of use Wii Hot Dog Bun, I guess, for Mario Kart controls.

216
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:07,135
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I want to read here?

217
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:11,217
[SPEAKER_00]: SSJ100Matt says, Mario Kart Wii looks like it's ripped from the arcade version.

218
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:15,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of hope not, because the arcade version, I don't know, it just doesn't have that same feel to me.

219
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,481
[SPEAKER_00]: The arcade version feels...

220
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:19,969
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

221
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:49,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

222
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:11,587
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Mario Kart Wii isn't the only thing to get excited about this year if you're a Nintendo fan.

223
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:17,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie Fils-Aimé is dropping some hints that there's a big holiday game coming out this year.

224
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:20,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I mean, obviously every company's got to have their big holiday game.

225
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:23,575
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be revealed at this year's E3.

226
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:28,439
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, he mentioned this in an interview with Jeff Keighley on Game Trailers TV.

227
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:36,464
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that the second half of 08's lineup will be announced at E3, which will probably include this year's big holiday title.

228
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:37,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?

229
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:42,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things that Reggie was asked about.

230
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,031
[SPEAKER_00]: The orchestra conductor demo.

231
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:47,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that thing you saw at the very first E3 where we showed up?

232
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was the last E3 most of us went to.

233
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:50,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with music.

234
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:50,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, who...

235
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:54,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know if that's actually going to be a full game yet.

236
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:59,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we did hear about that Wii music game, but there was never any word if the conductor thing was a part of that.

237
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,263
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, yeah.

238
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:00,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is it?

239
00:17:00,964 --> 00:17:01,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the game.

240
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:07,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, they asked him, Reggie, point blank about this, and Reggie said, who knows, maybe that's one of the things we'll talk about at E3.

241
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:09,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of dodging the question.

242
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:09,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Lame!

243
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:13,028
[SPEAKER_00]: He also dodged a question about Donkey Kong Wii.

244
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:14,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

245
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:15,392
[SPEAKER_02]: No thanks.

246
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:18,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Donkey Kong Bunga Blast sucked enough.

247
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:20,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need another Donkey Kong game.

248
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:28,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie did say that all the E3 releases, or actually, sorry, post-E3 releases will be, quote, maximizing all of our key franchises.

249
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:35,507
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can bet it's going to be either like an F-Zero game, the Animal Crossing game, which most people are speculating.

250
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:36,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I would bet it's the Animal Crossing game.

251
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:38,349
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be their big holiday title.

252
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,570
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.

253
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:43,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And what other big franchises have they still got to milk?

254
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:44,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirby.

255
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:44,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirby.

256
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever really milked Kirby on the Wii yet, have they?

257
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:46,909
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

258
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,431
[SPEAKER_00]: They did milk Kirby on the DS, but not yet.

259
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:55,676
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's going to be some type of Animal Crossing that will have some nifty little online feature that's going to make everybody want it.

260
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,418
[SPEAKER_00]: I say Animal Crossing Wii is their big title.

261
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,560
[SPEAKER_00]: They better fucking release Excite Truck 2.

262
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:04,263
[SPEAKER_00]: What if F-Zero was kind of Excite Truck-ish?

263
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:05,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.

264
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, that's like saying wipeouts, you know, like Excite Truck.

265
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:10,308
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.

266
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:11,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just eh.

267
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:13,487
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

268
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:40,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing, not really for the hardcore gamers, but that sounds feasible that they would do that.

269
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:44,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And every single Animal Crossing game I've ever heard of has always come out around that time of the year.

270
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:47,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that'd be my guess.

271
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And because they're whores like that and they would want to do that.

272
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:54,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, especially once we get to that point in, you know...

273
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Horse Candidate Kid Icarus

274
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's coming, but I don't think that's going to be it.

275
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:24,128
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a feeling it's going to come back.

276
00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:26,629
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just worked so well in Smash Bros.

277
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:33,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you watch some of those cinematics and play some of those stages, and you're like, God damn, they could put out a Kid Icarus game on the Wii and it would be awesome.

278
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:36,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as Actdeft says in chat, Kid Icarus.

279
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:41,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario RPG, that would be fucking awesome.

280
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:50,951
[SPEAKER_00]: D.Va and Chad says, Microsoft took all the DK platformer game rights after they purchased Rare.

281
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Odd1 says, yeah, it's probably Animal Crossing.

282
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:56,277
[SPEAKER_00]: They said at the end of the anime movie that it'd be coming.

283
00:19:57,707 --> 00:19:59,368
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also kind of one of those obvious things.

284
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:02,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, someday there will be another Zelda game and another Mario game.

285
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:06,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish, though, that Nintendo would come up with a new franchise.

286
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:08,575
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all down with that, too.

287
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they should come up with a new franchise.

288
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:13,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's nice, you know, that we get a new Mario game, a new Metroid game.

289
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,941
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, you know, you take all the surprise out of things.

290
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:22,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we know that there's going to be... Every time you're going to put out a new system, there's obviously going to be a Mario game and that kind of stuff.

291
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:23,787
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's like with...

292
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:24,997
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

293
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:26,258
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation stuff.

294
00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:29,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's always going to be a new Ratchet and Clank and that kind of crap.

295
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:34,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, to be fair, Nintendo does seem to put out a few original IPs that do rather well.

296
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:38,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's see, they had the Donkey Kong Bongo game, Pikmin.

297
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,943
[SPEAKER_00]: They had, what else?

298
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:45,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of the GameCube era that came out.

299
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:46,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess not Luigi's Mansion.

300
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:47,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

301
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:48,605
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I don't know.

302
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:51,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's possible for them to come up with some new stuff.

303
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:52,727
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they've done it before.

304
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,052
[SPEAKER_00]: WarioWare?

305
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:56,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that on GameCube?

306
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:58,093
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that started on Game Boy Advance, didn't it?

307
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:00,434
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun on GameCube, wasn't it?

308
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:01,494
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty fun on the GameCube.

309
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:05,235
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, they're capable of churning out some new stuff once in a while when they really want to.

310
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:06,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Wii Sports 2!

311
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:10,257
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna whore that franchise like a bitch.

312
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:13,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's... Wii Sports is kind of a new IP, right?

313
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:16,119
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a holiday title, too.

314
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:17,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not Wii Sports 2?

315
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:20,060
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Soccer Moms Across America would eat that shit up.

316
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're gonna whore it like a bitch.

317
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trademarking that.

318
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:23,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

319
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:27,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well, we'll see at this year's E3.

320
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for things that we said we would stop and wait and see on, it looks like Manhunt 2 is getting a UK release after all.

321
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:47,509
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the BBFC, they have no alternative but to give the 18 certificate to it, because basically, I guess they were overruled.

322
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually a twice...

323
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Rejected, and it went up for review again, and they said, okay, we have to.

324
00:21:57,626 --> 00:21:58,767
[SPEAKER_00]: So they finally just caved?

325
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:00,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

326
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,250
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of interesting.

327
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:13,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually the Video Appeals Committee gave their own review, and so because they've decided it should come out, it's going to come out.

328
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:14,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

329
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:25,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm not too surprised by this, but what kind of makes me think that maybe they finally decided to let it come out is maybe they saw what happened in America is that the game came out and nobody cared because the game kind of sucked.

330
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:27,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Blurring, crazy lighting gone

331
00:22:51,929 --> 00:23:19,786
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever too bad the game sucks and you know it's not worth playing do we have any I know we don't have a whole lot of overseas listeners that listen live but are any of our overseas listeners planning on purchasing this game overseas I bet I'm going to hear a lot of no's you don't want it do yourself a favor but there's no release date announced for it yet if you want to see something like if you want to play a game kind of like that I guess and more fun maybe try the Godfather game and maybe no more heroes or just wait for something better

332
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:20,998
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

333
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:21,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Even better.

334
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Something better.

335
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.

336
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Something better, the game.

337
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:26,202
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be the new Nintendo IP.

338
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:26,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Something better.

339
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:27,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Something better.

340
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:30,065
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna buy it.

341
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

342
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:40,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So we may be getting WiiWare in May, but of course Japan being super awesome and everything, they get it March 25th.

343
00:23:41,493 --> 00:23:44,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're gonna be launching with quite a few games.

344
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:48,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now they've got, of course, some of these...

345
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:54,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Okiraku Ping Pong Wii Word Puzzle Mojipitan Sakusaku Animal Panic

346
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:12,733
[SPEAKER_02]: by Konami, 4,000 points.

347
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:14,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Soldier... What?

348
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:15,234
[SPEAKER_02]: 4,000 points?

349
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:15,754
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,000 points.

350
00:24:16,195 --> 00:24:17,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you said 4,000.

351
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:18,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, fuck that.

352
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:20,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't worth buying that.

353
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:20,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

354
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:24,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Soldier R by Hudson for 800 points.

355
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:30,641
[SPEAKER_02]: My Life as a King, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for 1,500 points.

356
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:34,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel Solitaire by G-Mode for 500 points.

357
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:38,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mario and Baculus Extermination...

358
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:40,440
[SPEAKER_02]: 4,000 points.

359
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that name.

360
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds painful.

361
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:43,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Imbaculous.

362
00:24:44,923 --> 00:24:48,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's Pokemon Ranch for 1,000 points.

363
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:52,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And Longpuss by Genki for 1,000 points.

364
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:53,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not bad.

365
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:57,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

366
00:24:57,491 --> 00:24:58,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of looking forward to the service.

367
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:00,794
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting to see what kind of games are on there.

368
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:01,975
[SPEAKER_00]: When are we supposed to be getting that here?

369
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:02,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they say May?

370
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:03,155
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like May...

371
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:06,932
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

372
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:27,173
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

373
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:53,099
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe that's a stupid question because, you know, a lot of games that you might buy on the PC and stuff don't have a lot of those types of frills, especially the casual type games.

374
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,219
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I don't know.

375
00:25:54,699 --> 00:26:02,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now in this day and age, part of the charms of, you know, having the online connections and online gaming is getting to somewhat compete with friends.

376
00:26:02,283 --> 00:26:02,684
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

377
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:07,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't like the way that Nintendo handles their online, especially the friend stuff, the friend codes.

378
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:08,767
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to go.

379
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:09,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

380
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:10,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll see.

381
00:26:10,488 --> 00:26:14,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when the service actually launches in Japan, which is very, very soon...

382
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:16,572
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

383
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:42,107
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, in the meantime, we do know some more details about some of the other games that will be coming out on the WiiWare.

384
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,329
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is Tetris.

385
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:48,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetris Online will be coming on the WiiWare, and you can play it with up to six players.

386
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:50,636
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm guessing since it's called...

387
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:52,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

388
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:15,148
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming, yeah, some of these games are going to be online, which is a little better now.

389
00:27:15,588 --> 00:27:19,329
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need another version of Tetris, you'll be able to play that on the Wii very soon.

390
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:28,172
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to point out, though, based on some of these screenshots I'm looking at that's kind of cool, I'm looking at one particular two-player mode, and it looks like the wells aren't separated.

391
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:31,614
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually looks like the wells are combined into one giant well.

392
00:27:31,654 --> 00:27:36,975
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if there's a two-player mode where maybe both players play one giant board at the same time.

393
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,356
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of interesting.

394
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:40,914
[SPEAKER_00]: A different spin on a well-known formula.

395
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:41,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

396
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:46,077
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it looks like this game might bring some new things to the table, which is a good thing.

397
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:49,099
[SPEAKER_00]: I just asked about why I would need these types of games.

398
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Puzzle Fighter Wii.

399
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:50,981
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be awesome.

400
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,342
[SPEAKER_00]: With, like, Street Fighter 4 characters.

401
00:27:52,442 --> 00:27:52,842
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.

402
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:55,104
[SPEAKER_00]: RossDLUT comments in the chat room.

403
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:57,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Chat.OrangeLuncher.com Ooh, Tetris.

404
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:59,327
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so new and independent.

405
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:07,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in a way, if you think about the history of Tetris, it actually is a very independent game at its roots.

406
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:08,226
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, I get the point.

407
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:09,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's not that anymore.

408
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,707
[SPEAKER_02]: People are still playing fucking Pac-Man Championship Edition.

409
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,328
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just Pac-Man with neon lights.

410
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:16,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's all it fucking is.

411
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:19,389
[SPEAKER_00]: But Pac-Man Championship Edition is kind of rad.

412
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:19,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

413
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,850
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about it.

414
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,711
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just neon lights and rave music.

415
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:31,313
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all they need to do now is come out with the Pac-Man DS system and all you whores will buy it like nothing.

416
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:37,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Tetsuya comments in the chat room that Rob, they actually had that mode that I'm describing there on Tengen Tetris.

417
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:41,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the Forbidden Tetris on the NES many years ago?

418
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it.

419
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:44,664
[SPEAKER_00]: That got cut up on a licensing debacle?

420
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:47,286
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be even a better name for this online version.

421
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:48,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Forbidden Tetris.

422
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:50,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Forbidden Tetris.

423
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:52,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Tengen Tetris.

424
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:53,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?

425
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:53,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

426
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

427
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:56,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So you own Forbidden Tetris.

428
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:57,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

429
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Tangram Tetris.

430
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,213
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fascinating.

431
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:04,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever happened to the really shitty Tetris knockoffs we got?

432
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:07,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when Tetris got really popular in the early 90s or so?

433
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:11,956
[SPEAKER_00]: We got tons of just shitty, shitty ripoffs.

434
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:16,378
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Word Triss and Hat Triss and Face Triss.

435
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:17,458
[SPEAKER_04]: But Blast Triss was real.

436
00:29:17,998 --> 00:29:18,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Triss.

437
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:22,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetris 2 Bomb Bliss.

438
00:29:23,143 --> 00:29:26,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Blastrous was fun because you could shoot things.

439
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:28,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Shooting always makes things better, right?

440
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:29,989
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a SuperScope game.

441
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:31,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

442
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,950
[SPEAKER_04]: That was what made it cool.

443
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, enough reminiscing, I'm sorry.

444
00:29:34,212 --> 00:29:41,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something else that is cool, and this is particularly cool for me, because I love Hudson, and they're bringing us a real Bomberman.

445
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:50,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, it's for WiiWare, and it actually is a real Bomberman.

446
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:51,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're talking about

447
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:54,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Up to eight players in one game.

448
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,195
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what Famitsu says.

449
00:29:56,875 --> 00:30:01,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be out in Japan in June, so hopefully we'll get it.

450
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:03,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too long, I hope.

451
00:30:04,198 --> 00:30:05,318
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's Bomberman.

452
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:07,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Bomberman!

453
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Bomberman Act Zero?

454
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,265
[SPEAKER_04]: as in piece of shit Bomberman.

455
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:26,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I know.

456
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:29,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that kind of just ruined Bomberman for me.

457
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:33,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like watching your childhood get raped right in front of your eyes.

458
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:42,758
[SPEAKER_04]: We still regularly break out the Super Nintendo and the Multitap and play, you know, Bomberman 2, Super Bomberman 2.

459
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking more of the recent Xbox Live one.

460
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember how they had a Bomberman come out on Xbox Live and it was pretty faithful to the original?

461
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:53,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, my resounding reaction to the game was, meh.

462
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,942
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an actual... Hudson.

463
00:30:58,102 --> 00:30:59,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Hudson!

464
00:30:59,342 --> 00:31:00,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, Hudson.

465
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:01,524
[SPEAKER_02]: We play Bomberman.

466
00:31:02,764 --> 00:31:04,765
[SPEAKER_02]: On every system that's ever been made, ever.

467
00:31:05,686 --> 00:31:06,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some.

468
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:09,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you release four versions of it.

469
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:10,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen.

470
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:18,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it might seem like a good idea to release a lot of these each year, because, you know, you need money.

471
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:19,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

472
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:20,793
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

473
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:29,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading something else on here on the actual Famitsu article and from what I can see you can actually play as your me as a character in this game oh in that case I gotta buy that

474
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:54,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I sense that comment has a hint of sarcasm.

475
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:59,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I'm just trying to pick out what I can actually read on this.

476
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:01,515
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of cool, to be honest.

477
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:03,316
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is an interesting feature.

478
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:04,397
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.

479
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:13,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I mail away for an actual bomb piece of plastic that I can put on my Wii remote so that I can pretend I'm the real Bomberman?

480
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:14,743
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

481
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:38,044
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, somebody is in your fan club in chat.

482
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:39,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is on your side here.

483
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:43,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Odd1 in chat says, Bomberman is like Metal Slug.

484
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,686
[SPEAKER_00]: I only want more, dammit.

485
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:45,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, okay.

486
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:55,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you know that if I really like a game, I tend to like the entire series of it, no matter how much repetition it has.

487
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:57,819
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

488
00:33:20,003 --> 00:33:21,965
[SPEAKER_04]: which I'll get into later in the show.

489
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:27,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my suggestion, though, for how to make Bomberman a little more appealing to people like me.

490
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:29,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Forbidden Bomberman.

491
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:30,995
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on to something.

492
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,791
[SPEAKER_00]: and Blood Effect.

493
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,891
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on the wrong side of gaming.

494
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,932
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't be bitching about games like I do on the show.

495
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:38,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be making games.

496
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:40,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Show of hands in chat.

497
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Forbidden Bomberman.

498
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:45,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Y or N. Here's what you need to do.

499
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:49,997
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a small bit of innovation and it's ripping a little bit off of Taito, but who cares.

500
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:53,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomberman mixed with Rampage.

501
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,059
[SPEAKER_02]: You're blowing up cities and you're fighting each other.

502
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't want that?

503
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,752
[SPEAKER_02]: People like blowing things up, but they want a little bit more than just blowing up little cartoon characters.

504
00:34:01,812 --> 00:34:03,293
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to take out, like, cities.

505
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:04,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Rampage.

506
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:06,875
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to quit our damn jobs and start a gaming company.

507
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:09,316
[SPEAKER_00]: You are on a goldmine here.

508
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:10,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Bomberman mixed with Rampage.

509
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:11,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Genius.

510
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:12,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Forbidden Bomberman.

511
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:15,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't like to blow up cities full of innocent people?

512
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,000
[SPEAKER_00]: In games.

513
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Only in game form.

514
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:18,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in real life.

515
00:34:19,002 --> 00:34:19,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in game form.

516
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:21,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stress reliever.

517
00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:22,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomber Rampage.

518
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:24,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

519
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:26,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

520
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:28,384
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

521
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:54,663
[SPEAKER_02]: POPPING BUBBLE WRAP

522
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:11,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

523
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:12,635
[SPEAKER_00]: You know... I have bubble wrap at my desk.

524
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:13,896
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the real thing?

525
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:22,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I like popping real... Honestly, this reminds me of when I went to Barnes & Noble like ten years ago and found a big, thick book full of fat bubble wrap.

526
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:25,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not joking, and it was called Stress Relief Book.

527
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:29,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not kidding.

528
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:32,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we sure there's not more to this?

529
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:37,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, maybe it just looks like it's a bubble wrap popping game, but maybe there's more to it that we just don't know about yet?

530
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:40,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, with this bad translation thing gone wrong?

531
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:41,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

532
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:42,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It's put out by Namco Bandai.

533
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:45,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So Pac-Man's going to come out and eat it.

534
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:53,119
[SPEAKER_00]: For less than that, though, I could go to See's Candies because we all know the best part of See's Candy is that you get the little bubble wrap with everything you buy.

535
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:55,158
[SPEAKER_04]: is that only in California?

536
00:35:55,418 --> 00:36:16,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so well then you know what I had never heard of C's until I moved here okay the national and international people can just deal for a minute here California only for a minute here it's like getting something in the mail the best part of C's candy is that you get a little piece of bubble wrap in the pack with the candy I mean think about it for ten bucks I get a little box of candy and not only do I have real bubble wrap to pop but I also have wait for it

537
00:36:16,923 --> 00:36:17,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Candy!

538
00:36:18,104 --> 00:36:18,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello!

539
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:19,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the best part though.

540
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:27,150
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 40 levels that you'll be able to play and of course it features vibration feedback.

541
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:35,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and in fact they have a little link here on asovision.com slash puttyputty.

542
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:42,861
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch a little movie of this stupid little bubble wrap thing which, oh my god.

543
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:46,283
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like,

544
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

545
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:07,308
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot, every time you go into seas, they actually give you a free sample.

546
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:08,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Free is the best part.

547
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:16,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, Queltippo, who has a name I'm probably still mispronouncing in chat, says, Will it be like Gal's Panic, and after you pop the bubble wrap, you see a naked girl?

548
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:18,374
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this has a picture of tea.

549
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:22,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hooray, a picture of tea.

550
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:25,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, this is great, I want one.

551
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:26,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

552
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:29,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like this website sells them in five different colors.

553
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:31,915
[SPEAKER_02]: White, blue, pink, orange, and black.

554
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:33,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, we can sell orange ones.

555
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:35,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one to annoy people at work with.

556
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:37,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally going to get one.

557
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:43,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk about more incredibly awesome games that you can be spending your money on in the near future.

558
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:50,460
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a new game that is coming out on the DS, and it's called Babysitting Mania.

559
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,521
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a game that you can play on the...

560
00:37:55,014 --> 00:37:56,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

561
00:38:16,508 --> 00:38:18,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if you're the ultimate babysitter.

562
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:26,270
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you didn't expect was 20 of the craziest houses you've ever imagined being... And if the babies don't behave, then they get beat mania.

563
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:29,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, now.

564
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:30,871
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cool.

565
00:38:32,892 --> 00:38:33,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

566
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but apparently they're porting that to the DS.

567
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:36,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

568
00:38:37,673 --> 00:38:39,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's money in them DSs.

569
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:40,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently.

570
00:38:41,074 --> 00:38:41,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently.

571
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:45,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if one person buys it, they'll make back their budget.

572
00:38:46,621 --> 00:38:47,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.

573
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:21,591
[SPEAKER_04]: and the same Bill the Cat because, you know, we're coming up on election season and I used to vote for Bill the Cat.

574
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:24,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus, Bill the Cat in the game would actually be kind of cooler, I'm sorry.

575
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:31,774
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd just walk around spitting on things and hacking up hairballs and then getting drunk with, I guess, hot naked chicks or something.

576
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:42,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, Big the Cat is definitely going to be in it and it's, of course, being put out by BioWare and...

577
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:51,772
[SPEAKER_04]: People, basically, the co-founder who they were interviewing, Ray, is it pronounced Musica, I guess?

578
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:58,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you know, they actually asked him, you know, well, a lot of people don't like these characters.

579
00:39:58,274 --> 00:40:04,756
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, well, the whole point is to make you attach an emotion to the character and dislike is an emotion.

580
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:07,037
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay.

581
00:40:07,057 --> 00:40:07,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

582
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:17,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, he says that all the characters are going to be really pivotal to the game, and it's not like a whole bunch of little mini-games, but something that's fully interactive.

583
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:22,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess... I don't know how I feel about that.

584
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:26,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually thought that Big's part of the game was the most annoying part of Sonic Adventure.

585
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:28,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, Froggy.

586
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:32,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It should stop making retarded Sonic characters.

587
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:33,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

588
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:37,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Amy was cool because she walked around smacking stuff with a hammer.

589
00:40:37,495 --> 00:40:38,076
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.

590
00:40:38,496 --> 00:40:39,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Knuckles, cool.

591
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:42,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Mecha Sonic, really cool.

592
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,241
[SPEAKER_04]: But, no.

593
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I take the show on a completely random, unrelated tangent for just a minute?

594
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:50,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.

595
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:51,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what you're preaching.

596
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,622
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best thing.

597
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:53,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.

598
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:57,983
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were talking about Build the Cat, I started thinking about all these comic book cats, right?

599
00:40:58,003 --> 00:41:02,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, then there's like Felix the Cat and there's all these other cats, right?

600
00:41:02,145 --> 00:41:03,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Felix the Cat is great, though.

601
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:08,667
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I thought about Garfield and that made me think about Garfield minus Garfield.

602
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:09,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen this cartoon?

603
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:10,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have.

604
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,586
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best thing ever.

605
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:13,407
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more funny.

606
00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:14,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

607
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:16,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Garfield's not funny.

608
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:18,971
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take out Garfield, it's actually really funny.

609
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:19,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this blog.

610
00:41:20,152 --> 00:41:20,852
[SPEAKER_00]: All the ones with normal.

611
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,674
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this blog all about it.

612
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:30,159
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Garfield-Garfield.tumblr.com Whatever happened to our website of the week segment?

613
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:32,740
[SPEAKER_04]: It became the classic video game of the week segment.

614
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,341
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

615
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:34,622
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to just for a minute here.

616
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:42,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hijacking the website of the week segment.

617
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:47,801
[SPEAKER_00]: My website of the week is garfield-garfield.tumblr.com Check it out.

618
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:48,862
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hilarity.

619
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:52,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll link it in the chat room for people.

620
00:41:52,285 --> 00:41:52,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.

621
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:53,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do that for you guys right now.

622
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:55,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, live listeners.

623
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:57,049
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

624
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:58,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, sorry.

625
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,533
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your completely random off-the-subject tangent for tonight.

626
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:03,073
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

627
00:42:06,996 --> 00:42:07,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

628
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,266
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh... No, it's okay.

629
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:14,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Network problems, random tangents, sickness.

630
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:16,570
[SPEAKER_00]: This show has it all tonight, I mean, honestly.

631
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:27,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just gonna... Before you broke off on that whole Garfield thing, I was starting to say that Sonic and his friends are kind of reminding me, like, Godzilla and the other monsters, you know?

632
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:32,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they had the staple monsters that they made, and then they just started getting ridiculous with the monsters, you know?

633
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:32,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Just...

634
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,332
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

635
00:43:04,904 --> 00:43:05,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

636
00:43:30,456 --> 00:43:42,201
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will actually track how much you're exercising throughout the day or how much you're jiggling, I guess, and then track your progress throughout the DS title.

637
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:50,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure if they also have some exercises or something that talks you through, but I guess that's kind of neat.

638
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:53,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

639
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:54,406
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

640
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:56,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.

641
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:57,549
[SPEAKER_00]: WTF L-O-L

642
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:19,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

643
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody in the room will write a challenge on their DS.

644
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for instance, the screenshot I'm looking at says, Draw Panda Bear.

645
00:44:40,502 --> 00:44:46,724
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within a time limit, everybody else in the room has to draw... It sounds like Pictionary to me.

646
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:49,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody votes on the winner, and then you go to the next challenge.

647
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:50,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

648
00:44:51,446 --> 00:44:57,548
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, this sounded cool, because it reminded me a lot of Apples to Apples, where you would do something like that.

649
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:01,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I just started looking at this and thinking about it,

650
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:04,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't you do this already in PictoChat?

651
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:10,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, couldn't you, I don't know, do the exact same thing just with like a little egg timer?

652
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:12,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Or better yet, here's the thing.

653
00:45:12,106 --> 00:45:15,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how you can play LOL without even a Nintendo DS.

654
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:18,008
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Pen and Paper.

655
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,180
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I need to do this?

656
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,382
[SPEAKER_00]: You would actually need to get some pens and some paper.

657
00:45:25,962 --> 00:45:28,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I use any type of pens or certain pens will work for this?

658
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:30,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a pen that would show up.

659
00:45:30,405 --> 00:45:34,347
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't want to use a pink pen because that's kind of hard to see unless you want to go for LOL value.

660
00:45:34,828 --> 00:45:36,228
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure you have a pen.

661
00:45:36,288 --> 00:45:40,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And the paper, it could be lined paper or grid paper or blank paper.

662
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:45,494
[SPEAKER_04]: If people do insist on having it in a virtual environment, open Canvas.

663
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:50,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you can network on open canvas and everyone can draw on the same picture.

664
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do we need to do to get the word out about this pen and paper?

665
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:56,725
[SPEAKER_00]: That Yahoo chat thingy with the draw board is hilarious.

666
00:45:56,785 --> 00:45:58,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Or freaking Oikaki.

667
00:45:59,027 --> 00:46:01,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think you're onto something with this pen and paper.

668
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:02,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, though.

669
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:03,071
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

670
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:03,652
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you.

671
00:46:03,712 --> 00:46:08,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, think of what OLR Productions has come up with in the scope of just a few weeks.

672
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:09,778
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Forbidden Bomberman.

673
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:15,391
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the pen and paper version of LOL, which we can totally undercut these guys putting it out on DS.

674
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:19,273
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, we're the ones that thought of LaserCats the game.

675
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:20,633
[SPEAKER_00]: True.

676
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:21,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you.

677
00:46:22,694 --> 00:46:24,054
[SPEAKER_00]: EA's going to buy us tomorrow.

678
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:25,134
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of time.

679
00:46:26,255 --> 00:46:27,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a matter of time.

680
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:29,596
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we'll sell.

681
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:35,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have T in chat says, pen and paper is the wave of the future.

682
00:46:37,278 --> 00:46:37,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

683
00:46:39,404 --> 00:46:47,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how about the wave of the future that is actually not necessarily in ours anytime soon?

684
00:46:49,451 --> 00:46:51,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess who else is getting Wii Fit before us?

685
00:46:54,134 --> 00:46:54,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

686
00:46:54,955 --> 00:46:58,537
[SPEAKER_00]: How about, I don't know, what's a country we don't hear about very often in the news?

687
00:46:58,657 --> 00:47:00,619
[SPEAKER_00]: How about... Slovakia?

688
00:47:01,597 --> 00:47:03,818
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the country of Chad in Africa?

689
00:47:03,938 --> 00:47:05,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Chad getting the game before we are?

690
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:06,980
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but they're getting it in Australia.

691
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Chad ruined our elections.

692
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:10,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, right?

693
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Chad, Australia, what's the difference?

694
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:12,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Australia's cool.

695
00:47:13,202 --> 00:47:13,762
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.

696
00:47:14,323 --> 00:47:15,463
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Australia, of course I do.

697
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:18,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did get Priscilla, Queen of the Desert from them.

698
00:47:19,405 --> 00:47:19,805
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.

699
00:47:19,865 --> 00:47:23,487
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite movies ever is Muriel's Wedding, I have to say.

700
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:25,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And Olivia Newton-John.

701
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:25,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

702
00:47:27,563 --> 00:47:28,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Actdeft hit the nail on the head.

703
00:47:28,684 --> 00:47:31,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Without Australia, you would never have The Dingo Ate My Baby.

704
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,027
[SPEAKER_00]: You would never have that.

705
00:47:57,122 --> 00:47:58,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the Didgeridoo Techno.

706
00:47:59,064 --> 00:47:59,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

707
00:48:01,706 --> 00:48:06,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a moment to salute our Australian fans and their history.

708
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:07,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Their great history.

709
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:08,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Australia.

710
00:48:09,311 --> 00:48:10,412
[SPEAKER_04]: From OLR.

711
00:48:10,612 --> 00:48:16,177
[SPEAKER_00]: So see, Australia, because of their greatness and contributions to culture, they get the game a little early.

712
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:17,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was very nice of Nintendo to do.

713
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:18,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

714
00:48:19,759 --> 00:48:21,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, they're getting it on May 8th.

715
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:22,502
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting ours on May 19th.

716
00:48:22,522 --> 00:48:22,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

717
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:32,804
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be coming out for $150 Australian, which is, the equivalence is 140 here, or 91 Euro.

718
00:48:34,465 --> 00:48:36,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already sold over a million.

719
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Our dollar went to shit, didn't it?

720
00:48:39,967 --> 00:48:43,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Our dollar really, really went to shit sometime in the past couple years, didn't it?

721
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:46,010
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it gets any worse, we're going to have to start calling it pesos.

722
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

723
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:48,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

724
00:48:49,832 --> 00:48:51,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I could go to Europe, and I could work.

725
00:48:53,126 --> 00:48:58,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go to Europe like people from Mexico come here to earn money and come back rich.

726
00:48:59,107 --> 00:48:59,627
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

727
00:48:59,787 --> 00:49:04,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, like I was saying, it's already sold over a million units in Japan.

728
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:14,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on April 25th in Europe for £69.99 in the UK and €89.99 everywhere else in Europe.

729
00:49:15,231 --> 00:49:18,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're getting it on the 19th of May.

730
00:49:19,191 --> 00:49:22,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So that gets the whatever award for me, but

731
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:23,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

732
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, Australia.

733
00:49:26,643 --> 00:49:31,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You've beat out Europe and America.

734
00:49:32,065 --> 00:49:32,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Kudos to you.

735
00:49:32,965 --> 00:49:34,546
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to make it fair, I guess.

736
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:36,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

737
00:49:36,246 --> 00:49:37,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirpok can ask a question.

738
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:39,308
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the capital of Australia?

739
00:49:42,029 --> 00:49:42,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Sydney?

740
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:42,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.

741
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:44,009
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most common mistake.

742
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,210
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, but like, see, I can, it's Canberra.

743
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:46,811
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Canberra.

744
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:51,292
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing is that, but you could do the same thing is that like quick Australian listeners.

745
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:52,573
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the capital of Florida?

746
00:49:54,622 --> 00:49:55,643
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you said Miami?

747
00:49:56,844 --> 00:49:57,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

748
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:57,884
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.

749
00:49:57,965 --> 00:49:58,685
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Tallahassee.

750
00:49:59,125 --> 00:49:59,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

751
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:00,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying.

752
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:01,407
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be wrong.

753
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:04,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Miami is the capital of where old folks go to die.

754
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Miami is also the capital of cocaine.

755
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:07,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.

756
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:09,693
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kidding.

757
00:50:10,494 --> 00:50:11,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Love Miami.

758
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you guys.

759
00:50:12,435 --> 00:50:13,516
[SPEAKER_04]: When have you been to Miami?

760
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:17,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I went to their airport once on my way to Jamaica.

761
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been to Miami thousands of times thanks to the power of television.

762
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually been to Miami once, and I was two years old.

763
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:30,848
[SPEAKER_00]: And SSJ100Matt has a perfect example.

764
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:35,473
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask people what the capital of California is, hello, we live there, and most people don't know.

765
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:39,176
[SPEAKER_04]: If you say Los Angeles, then you need to get your head out of your ass.

766
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:43,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, wait a minute, you said Sydney was the capital of Australia.

767
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your head out of your ass.

768
00:50:45,602 --> 00:50:47,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't live there, so I have an excuse.

769
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:49,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Or get your ass out of your head, because it's Australia.

770
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:49,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it upside down?

771
00:50:50,835 --> 00:50:52,037
[SPEAKER_00]: And the toilet flush backwards?

772
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:53,639
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell happened to tonight's show?

773
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:55,901
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not right.

774
00:50:56,222 --> 00:50:57,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to keep going then.

775
00:50:57,523 --> 00:50:57,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do.

776
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,465
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a game that's coming out here in May pretty soon.

777
00:51:01,565 --> 00:51:02,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty psyched about it.

778
00:51:02,485 --> 00:51:03,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Blastworks.

779
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally it was Tamiki Fighters.

780
00:51:06,508 --> 00:51:11,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course now it's been... It's very little like Tamiki Fighters now.

781
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:13,272
[SPEAKER_02]: But still the same kind of concept.

782
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:20,157
[SPEAKER_02]: What's kind of neat about it though is you'll actually... Of course the game has about 20 different levels you can play and stuff.

783
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:24,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And plays a little bit like Katamari meets a really intense shooter game.

784
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,122
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you'll be able to design completely new ships...

785
00:51:28,883 --> 00:51:33,708
[SPEAKER_02]: New levels, new enemies, new AI patterns, and new bullet patterns.

786
00:51:33,768 --> 00:51:40,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, completely customizable, and you can share all this content over WeConnect24, which is pretty cool.

787
00:51:40,494 --> 00:51:44,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the levels, I guess, they were just showing off to, like, Joystick, for example.

788
00:51:44,898 --> 00:51:53,886
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them looked like the environment was made out of paper, and you're actually flying a paper airplane and fighting other paper airplanes and origamis, enemies, and stuff like that.

789
00:51:54,366 --> 00:51:55,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So really cool stuff.

790
00:51:56,152 --> 00:52:03,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus the game itself also has unlockable versions of Tumiki Fighters and some of the other games made by Kenta Cho.

791
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:10,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're interested in checking out Tumiki Fighters, it's actually available for free on his website.

792
00:52:10,165 --> 00:52:13,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do a search for Tumiki Fighters and definitely check it out.

793
00:52:14,169 --> 00:52:16,151
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is slated to come out in the U.S.

794
00:52:17,652 --> 00:52:20,355
[SPEAKER_02]: in May, and I can't wait to check it out.

795
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,220
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

796
00:52:44,724 --> 00:52:45,344
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

797
00:52:45,424 --> 00:52:48,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is going to be one of those games that a lot of people aren't going to know about.

798
00:52:48,986 --> 00:52:50,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those under-the-radar games.

799
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:54,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be one of those under-the-radar costs, where it's only $20, or do we know a price point on this yet?

800
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,630
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly, I think it was like $39.99.

801
00:52:58,951 --> 00:53:01,492
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of your typical wheat.

802
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,643
[SPEAKER_00]: One step below your AAA Wii titles, basically.

803
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:06,743
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, I think the value's pretty good.

804
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:17,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it was just going to be a straight port of Tamaki Fighters, it might be a little high, but with all the, like, user-created stuff, I mean, you can get pretty crazy with this game, so... Alright, it'll be fun.

805
00:53:17,887 --> 00:53:21,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good gaming story to bring us back from our Capitals of the World discussion.

806
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.

807
00:53:22,688 --> 00:53:24,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki's always working hard for OLR, isn't he?

808
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:25,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.

809
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:27,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

810
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:28,310
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, definitely, there's...

811
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:30,669
[SPEAKER_02]: GameTrailers.com GameTrailers.com

812
00:53:55,339 --> 00:53:58,401
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually this will be the entirety of Japan is getting these releases.

813
00:53:59,301 --> 00:54:15,929
[SPEAKER_00]: This week in gaming on March 19th, they are getting on the Xbox 360 Armored Core for Answer, Army of Two, Blazing Angels 2, Need for Speed Pro Street, Sengoku Mosu 2, and that's quite a few Xbox 360 games for one week.

814
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,070
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

815
00:54:18,365 --> 00:54:22,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Odd1 in chat says this is his favorite part of the show, Rob butchering the Japanese releases.

816
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:24,271
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I read them, because I can't pronounce any of them.

817
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,495
[SPEAKER_00]: PlayStation 3, I can pronounce Armored Core, that's easy enough.

818
00:54:28,896 --> 00:54:36,063
[SPEAKER_00]: PlayStation 3 also gets Armored Core, also gets Arm Eve 2, also gets Blazing Angels 2, but gets another game, Folk Soul...

819
00:54:39,324 --> 00:54:56,049
[SPEAKER_00]: you might just know that as folklore but that's actually getting a price reduction that's already been out there it's just a price reduction also getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3 Resistance Ridge Racer 7 which I can't pronounce and Mobile Suit Gundam Target Insight all getting price reductions this week

820
00:54:56,855 --> 00:54:58,797
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, cheaper games is never bad news.

821
00:54:59,537 --> 00:55:06,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, on the Nintendo Wii, speaking of price reductions, Bomberland Wii is moving into the best, but some new games coming out.

822
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:08,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider-Man 3 just now coming out in Japan.

823
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:17,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest you just pass on that, but maybe you want to pick up the House of the Dead 2 and 3 with the Wii Zapper, um, also being sold independently there.

824
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:20,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Dekasporta also coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan.

825
00:55:21,555 --> 00:55:23,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to the PlayStation 2, uh,

826
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:30,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing really new coming out there, just some price reductions on the Godfather and Kamiwaza.

827
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:34,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to look forward to next week is the Metal Gear Solid collection, if you're looking out for that.

828
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check out the handhelds.

829
00:55:36,351 --> 00:55:40,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to the Nintendo DS, Bangayo Spirits comes out this week in Japan.

830
00:55:41,015 --> 00:55:41,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay!

831
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:45,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Cho Naketsu, Koku Kunio-kun, Dodgeball comes out.

832
00:55:45,818 --> 00:55:48,660
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a fun week for Japan.

00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:56,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming out from Konami, Kachishima Kosaku DS, Dekuru Otoko no Love and Success.

834
00:55:57,986 --> 00:56:02,188
[SPEAKER_00]: SimCity DS 2 also comes out from EA on the Nintendo DS.

835
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:04,170
[SPEAKER_00]: And quickly glancing at the PSP,

836
00:56:04,997 --> 00:56:07,959
[SPEAKER_00]: To see if there's anything of note for you guys in Japan on there.

837
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Biohazard Trilogy Box.

838
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:11,602
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the movies.

839
00:56:11,822 --> 00:56:12,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, not the games.

840
00:56:13,563 --> 00:56:16,245
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want that on your PSP, you can check that out.

841
00:56:16,566 --> 00:56:18,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a port of Need for Speed Pro Street.

842
00:56:19,328 --> 00:56:26,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And since Skype was recently released in Japan, I believe we covered that on last week's news, the PSP microphone is finally hitting the shelves this week in Japan.

843
00:56:26,953 --> 00:56:27,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.

844
00:56:27,854 --> 00:56:30,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Kunio-kun Dodgeball.

845
00:56:30,296 --> 00:56:33,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can import it from one of your favorite import retailers.

846
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you wait a few months...

847
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some releases for you guys On the 20th

848
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:13,870

[SPEAKER_04]: That would be Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fate, we have Offroad for PS2, PC, and PSP, Samurai Warriors 2, Extreme Legends, and that's it.

851
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:44,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Very surprised no one mentioned Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fate in their gaming weeks because I heard the game came out.

852
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:47,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my friends picked it up and have been raving about it.

853
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:48,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like Crystal Chronicles.

854
00:57:48,846 --> 00:57:54,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't either, but the DS version doesn't look quite like the GameCube one, so it might be worth a look.

855
00:57:54,628 --> 00:57:55,028
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

856
00:57:55,828 --> 00:57:56,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.

857
00:57:56,448 --> 00:57:57,128
[SPEAKER_00]: How about Chatters?

858
00:57:57,229 --> 00:57:58,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Chatters, any of our Chatters pick it up?

859
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Post your reviews real quickly.

860
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read some of them in a minute.

861
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:05,874
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US, we're getting a few things that are pretty interesting.

862
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:12,297
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, of course, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

863
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:15,839

865
00:58:20,661 --> 00:58:24,703
[SPEAKER_02]: The Metal Gear Solid Essentials Collection is coming out on PlayStation 2.

866
00:58:24,983 --> 00:58:30,426
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to relive some of those older Metal Gear games before number 4 comes out.

867
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:35,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Condemned 2 Bloodshot on PlayStation 3, apparently a week late.

868
00:58:37,048 --> 00:58:39,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Shots Golf Out of Bounds on PlayStation 3.

869
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost in Blue 3 on the DS.

870
00:58:44,236 --> 00:58:48,100
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still shocked that they actually got a third game in that series.

871
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be surprised if we see a fourth one either.

872
00:58:50,463 --> 00:58:51,644
[SPEAKER_02]: They're whoring that thing to death.

873
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:56,670
[SPEAKER_02]: SingStar 90s Edition is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.

[SPEAKER_02]: Samurai Warriors 2 Extreme Legends on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 via download.

875
00:59:05,492 --> 00:59:06,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other fun stuff.

876
00:59:07,273 --> 00:59:09,893

[SPEAKER_02]: Go Pets Vacation Island on the DS.

879
00:59:18,325 --> 00:59:20,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Which looks really weird and kind of stupid looking.

880
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on the Wii.

881
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:25,149
[SPEAKER_02]: That one also is a week late.

882
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:29,552
[SPEAKER_02]: George of the Jungle on PlayStation 2 Wii and the DS.

883
00:59:31,232 --> 00:59:32,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see here.

884
00:59:36,556 --> 00:59:40,578
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation 3 version of Karaoke Revolution American Idol is finally coming out.

885
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:43,480
[SPEAKER_02]: That totally delayed for about a month now.

886
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see.

887
00:59:48,919 --> 01:00:10,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's it next week though the week after next I should say and I can't wait for this Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 for PSP alright well moving on talking about something recently hitting the US DDR you remember DDR?

888
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:13,044
[SPEAKER_00]: our whole show used to be our whole show used to be about DDR

889
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,211
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.

890
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:19,853
[SPEAKER_00]: And DDR is still going.

891
01:00:20,393 --> 01:00:23,637
[SPEAKER_00]: DDR, obviously, you know, we get phone calls from folks on Skype once in a while.

892
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:25,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you love Bomani like you used to?

893
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have to say, because it hasn't changed.

894
01:00:28,614 --> 01:00:31,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyhow, actually, DDR is changing a little bit.

895
01:00:32,315 --> 01:00:34,276
[SPEAKER_00]: E-Amusement, you've heard of this before, right?

896
01:00:34,356 --> 01:00:37,217
[SPEAKER_00]: E-Amusement is a system they have in Japan, where you basically have these little cards.

897
01:00:37,757 --> 01:00:40,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Picture, y'all know, if you've been to the arcades, y'all know Initial D, right?

898
01:00:40,698 --> 01:00:41,298
[SPEAKER_00]: How you have the cards.

899
01:00:41,598 --> 01:00:50,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Picture something like that, but on a DDR machine, where you can kind of save your high scores, but it's also hooked into the internet, and so you can have these global leaderboards and all this stuff.

900
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:51,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?

901
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:55,122
[SPEAKER_00]: The E-Amusement system, finally, after all these years, is hitting America.

902
01:00:56,108 --> 01:01:04,134
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is coming from an official Konami website, ddronlinecommunity.com is their website, and it's got the Konami logos and all that fun stuff.

903
01:01:05,174 --> 01:01:10,718
[SPEAKER_00]: They are announcing that Naperville, Illinois, of all places, because when I think of arcade gaming, I think of Naperville, Illinois.

904
01:01:11,299 --> 01:01:12,960
[SPEAKER_00]: But this must be one hella good arcade.

905
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Brunswick Zone is the arcade that's going to be getting the EMU system.

906
01:01:16,122 --> 01:01:20,585
[SPEAKER_00]: And come to think of it, this is an arcade that usually does a lot of the beta tests for DDR, so I'm not surprised.

907
01:01:21,065 --> 01:01:22,266
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of funny that, you know,

908
01:01:23,737 --> 01:01:25,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Ground Zero for TDR Evolution.

909
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:30,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure because I don't know too much about Benson, but maybe it's close to one of Benson's distribution centers or something like that.

910
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:31,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

911
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:31,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

912
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just guessing.

913
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:34,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Brunswick makes me think of bowling.

914
01:01:35,622 --> 01:01:35,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

915
01:01:36,556 --> 01:01:38,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I think Brunswick did make bowling stuff.

916
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:39,438
[SPEAKER_04]: They made bowling pins.

917
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:42,019
[SPEAKER_00]: They might do entertainment stuff, you know, in other places.

918
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:48,783
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyhow, and as Konami says on the site, it's the new online service which connects arcade locations in North America via the internet.

919
01:01:49,124 --> 01:01:53,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcade players can compete with each other, review their ranking, tournament results, save the play data, and more.

920
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:58,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Konami will expand this new level service nationwide with Brunswick Bowling and Billiards.

921
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,671
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming to a bowling alley near you.

922
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:02,171
[SPEAKER_00]: There you have it.

923
01:02:02,732 --> 01:02:06,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my question is, is this enough to make you interested in DDR again?

924
01:02:07,938 --> 01:02:08,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

925
01:02:09,078 --> 01:02:10,839
[SPEAKER_00]: I say not really.

926
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of miss the old internet ranking that we had back in the day.

927
01:02:14,341 --> 01:02:15,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that was old school.

928
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:34,929
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, besides the fact that I do miss DDR a little bit for the nostalgia value, here's the reason why I don't think this is exactly the kick in the butt in the community that DDR's kind of needed for about, oh, four years now, is that the internet's already been doing this long before Konami decided to officially endorse it.

929
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:39,352
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been going on since like 4th Mix.

930
01:02:39,392 --> 01:02:41,335
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those tracking sites for DDR?

931
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:42,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they've come and gone.

932
01:02:42,597 --> 01:02:44,059
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long those things have been around.

933
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:52,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, didn't a long time ago, and it was built in the 4th Mix, they had a code that you could write down that you could go onto the website and plug it in, and there's your internet rankings.

934
01:02:53,447 --> 01:02:54,108
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

935
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:16,836
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody could challenge you if they thought you were lying about your score.

936
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:17,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

937
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:18,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's cool.

938
01:03:20,059 --> 01:03:21,780
[SPEAKER_00]: GS68 says VJ Army.

939
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like that, but DDR.

940
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,683
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one for DDR they had.

941
01:03:25,163 --> 01:03:27,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what they need to do, and this would be pretty cool.

942
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:32,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, you could have certain teams or whatever that you...

943
01:03:34,247 --> 01:03:51,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess associate yourself with I don't know how many different colors or whatever and then you could say like you play different arcades around the country or the world or whatever and you kind of capture them and they become like blue or whatever or red or whatever your color is and then kind of like remember how they had with Soul Calibur?

944
01:03:52,073 --> 01:03:53,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Soul Calibur.

945
01:03:53,074 --> 01:03:54,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that was fun.

946
01:03:54,894 --> 01:03:58,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's the thing, you're talking about making DDR a more competitive game, right?

947
01:03:58,676 --> 01:04:02,217
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been saying for five years on this program that DDR's needed to do.

948
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,186
[SPEAKER_00]: There is innovation sitting in there in the game.

949
01:04:06,226 --> 01:04:08,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make DDR more competitive as opposed to cooperative game.

950
01:04:08,966 --> 01:04:14,568
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make a whole new game out of it and really kick some butt in the franchise, but nobody's listening.

951
01:04:15,528 --> 01:04:22,930
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need to do, and I'm not sure who's in charge of the DDR games, is they need to get someone new in charge of the DDR games.

952
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:26,771
[SPEAKER_00]: DDR Recall, says Actdeft, was the name of what I was trying to think of earlier.

953
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:27,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

954
01:04:28,712 --> 01:04:29,092
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.

955
01:04:32,153 --> 01:04:35,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, so those of you that are still playing DDR, and I know we have a lot of DDR fans on the list.

956
01:04:35,495 --> 01:04:36,555
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to knock DDR.

957
01:04:36,575 --> 01:04:39,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, it's still a great game because it keeps you physical and everything.

958
01:04:39,677 --> 01:04:43,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if I had the money and a room, I'd be buying a machine for my house.

959
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:45,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so whatever.

960
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd still be playing it.

961
01:04:47,641 --> 01:04:50,502
[SPEAKER_00]: It just frustrates me that they won't innovate the damn game.

962
01:04:50,722 --> 01:04:52,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't have time to make it down to arcades anymore.

963
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:54,504
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it one more time.

964
01:04:55,285 --> 01:04:59,987
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody happens to be listening, and I know we have folks on the inside that listen to this show once in a great while.

965
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:05,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuke your code, build something from the ground up, innovate in the process.

966
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:07,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch money flow in.

967
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:13,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And stop, for the love of God, I know that you like doing these other modes like the fitness mode and that kind of shit.

968
01:05:14,352 --> 01:05:16,413
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to go that crazy with this stuff.

969
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:20,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think they've made it too user-friendly, too simple, you know what I mean?

970
01:05:22,095 --> 01:05:24,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you need a training mode in every single DDR game.

971
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:28,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know I didn't need a training mode to play the damn game.

972
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:30,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned just fine by playing the damn game.

973
01:05:32,657 --> 01:05:33,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on.

974
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:35,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we?

975
01:05:36,018 --> 01:05:36,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

976
01:05:37,178 --> 01:05:42,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there is more news out there that will make iPhone owners happy, including myself.

977
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:50,341
[SPEAKER_04]: There are going to be some game releases, including Pac-Man and Galaga.

978
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:52,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And that makes me very happy.

979
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:54,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Also... Sorry, go ahead.

980
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:56,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Also bejeweled.

981
01:05:57,623 --> 01:05:58,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's...

982
01:05:59,908 --> 01:06:02,411
[SPEAKER_04]: and Zuma and Peggle, which I don't really give a crap about.

983
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I just care about Pac-Man and Galaga.

984
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:06,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Peggle is really awesome, actually.

985
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:07,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

986
01:06:07,455 --> 01:06:07,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

987
01:06:09,056 --> 01:06:09,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank God!

988
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:10,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I can play Pac-Man!

989
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if you play with your finger.

990
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:17,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't you play pretty much all these games on the iPod anyway?

991
01:06:18,324 --> 01:06:19,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Including Peggle?

992
01:06:20,126 --> 01:06:21,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is actually one of the better systems.

993
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,128
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the iPod was made for Peggle.

994
01:06:23,168 --> 01:06:23,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

995
01:06:23,749 --> 01:06:24,790
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I hear, it sucks.

996
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:27,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Bejeweled, you have to kind of cycle through all the, like,

997
01:06:27,828 --> 01:06:31,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Gems and stuff using the little, whatever the fuck they call that thing.

998
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:32,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Touch wheel.

999
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:34,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Touch wheel.

1000
01:06:34,171 --> 01:06:34,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

1001
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Gay wheel, whatever.

1002
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,733
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole screen is touch screen.

1003
01:06:38,474 --> 01:06:40,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I don't know.

1004
01:06:40,235 --> 01:06:43,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you should just be able to poke whichever one and then poke the one next to it.

1005
01:06:44,117 --> 01:06:45,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Bejeweled would be good on it.

1006
01:06:45,437 --> 01:06:47,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would work pretty well.

1007
01:06:47,258 --> 01:06:49,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised they haven't put Bejeweled on the DS yet.

1008
01:06:49,499 --> 01:06:50,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they really...

1009
01:06:51,505 --> 01:06:54,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, put a PopCap collection on the DS.

1010
01:06:54,327 --> 01:06:55,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch how much that sells.

1011
01:06:55,627 --> 01:06:57,729
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what else would work out?

1012
01:06:57,769 --> 01:07:00,190
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what other games would work really well on the iPhone?

1013
01:07:01,431 --> 01:07:02,171
[SPEAKER_00]: New things.

1014
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:04,172
[SPEAKER_00]: New games.

1015
01:07:05,233 --> 01:07:06,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that haven't been thought of yet.

1016
01:07:07,835 --> 01:07:08,475
[SPEAKER_00]: New stuff.

1017
01:07:09,508 --> 01:07:11,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this game that we would like to pitch.

1018
01:07:11,249 --> 01:07:12,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Pen and Paper.

1019
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:18,856
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use the iPhone as paper and you can write stuff with your stylus, which is the pen.

1020
01:07:19,316 --> 01:07:20,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and here's one.

1021
01:07:20,877 --> 01:07:25,841
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based off a popular Saturday Night Live sketch and you have cats and they have lasers attached to their heads.

1022
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:29,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And where you touch on the screen, you shoot lasers at dogs and people.

1023
01:07:31,366 --> 01:07:33,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes other laser cats in multiplayer mode.

1024
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:35,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a random thought pop into my head.

1025
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:36,522
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

1026
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:40,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had a different video game experience this week, but that was watching the Family Guy Star Wars special.

1027
01:07:43,203 --> 01:07:44,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it feel like a game or something?

1028
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:48,124
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they were going into an asteroid field and it was asteroids.

1029
01:07:49,044 --> 01:07:49,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1030
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:51,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1031
01:07:53,885 --> 01:08:00,407
[SPEAKER_02]: So, apparently the Chinese Olympics website has been accused of game piracy.

1032
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:01,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1033
01:08:02,051 --> 01:08:11,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they have been stealing some Flash games that they feature on the website and kind of changing them just a little bit, but they're still blatantly stealing them.

1034
01:08:13,059 --> 01:08:29,350
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the creator of these Flash games, Kaden Batrick, who noticed some very similar similarities with different games like FUA Fights, The Olympic Clouds, which is very similar to his Snow Day game that he has.

1035
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:30,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there are some other ones.

1036
01:08:31,745 --> 01:08:32,766
[SPEAKER_02]: that were also very similar.

1037
01:08:33,446 --> 01:08:48,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know, these have been removed from the Olympic sites as of last Monday, but there's still a couple games that are on there that may be stolen from some other websites as well.

1038
01:08:48,633 --> 01:08:56,237
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, as if we didn't need more reasons to say the Olympics suck.

1039
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Odd1 has an interesting comment in chat.

1040
01:08:58,323 --> 01:09:02,385
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, wait, aren't most Flash games rip-offs of each other or classic games?

1041
01:09:02,525 --> 01:09:05,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, the Flash arena is rife with IP theft and copying.

1042
01:09:06,046 --> 01:09:09,327
[SPEAKER_02]: True, they are, but this I think was blatant.

1043
01:09:09,507 --> 01:09:14,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just like, if you made a Super Mario Bros.

1044
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:22,471
[SPEAKER_02]: game, but instead you changed it to, I don't know, a female chicken or something like that, that would be a blatant rip-off of Mario Bros.

1045
01:09:23,611 --> 01:09:26,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, you called it like Chick Sisters or something like that.

1046
01:09:27,113 --> 01:09:28,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that the PETA game?

1047
01:09:28,394 --> 01:09:29,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, that was.

1048
01:09:29,355 --> 01:09:30,096
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1049
01:09:30,136 --> 01:09:31,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, blatant ripoff.

1050
01:09:31,297 --> 01:09:34,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, though, because the level design was totally different.

1051
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was crap.

1052
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I get what you're saying.

1053
01:09:36,581 --> 01:09:37,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Made me hungry for chicken, though.

1054
01:09:41,105 --> 01:09:41,466
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1055
01:09:41,726 --> 01:09:45,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, who goes to the Chinese Olympics website to play Flash games?

1056
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:48,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, are people that bored?

1057
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:49,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

1058
01:09:50,473 --> 01:09:51,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.

1059
01:09:52,936 --> 01:09:53,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Well...

1060
01:09:53,948 --> 01:09:59,791
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just about done with part A tonight, but first off we have to read about our stupid person of the week.

1061
01:10:00,172 --> 01:10:03,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I don't know, this isn't so much stupid as it's just kind of sad.

1062
01:10:03,774 --> 01:10:07,636
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know how else to say it, so let's cue some music to read this very sad story.

1063
01:10:13,599 --> 01:10:21,404
[SPEAKER_00]: A 15-year-old boy in the Austin area of Austin, Texas got killed, gunshot wound to the head.

1064
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:27,397
[SPEAKER_00]: The boy was playing a video game and his friend just shot him in the head.

1065
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:28,838
[SPEAKER_00]: 13-year-old shooter.

1066
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:36,024
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 years old shoots his 15-year-old friend in the head over a video game, I suppose, is what the story is trying to say.

1067
01:10:36,404 --> 01:10:38,686
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they do make a mention at the very end of this story.

1068
01:10:39,567 --> 01:10:40,968
[SPEAKER_00]: The boys were playing a video game.

1069
01:10:42,068 --> 01:10:43,189
[SPEAKER_00]: The game was called God of War.

1070
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:46,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes, because there's tons of gun violence in God of War.

1071
01:10:50,575 --> 01:10:52,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to these kids.

1072
01:10:54,127 --> 01:10:55,989
[SPEAKER_00]: for giving Gamers Everywhere a wonderful name.

1073
01:10:56,769 --> 01:10:57,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Where were the parents?

1074
01:10:58,711 --> 01:10:59,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Where?

1075
01:11:00,772 --> 01:11:02,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Out buying more ammo, of course.

1076
01:11:04,495 --> 01:11:09,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I don't see how... There's no way they're going to be able to tie that to the game because there's no fucking guns in God of War.

1077
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:10,740
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.

1078
01:11:11,521 --> 01:11:11,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.

1079
01:11:15,344 --> 01:11:16,024
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sucks.

1080
01:11:17,085 --> 01:11:18,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not funny.

1081
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:19,567
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad.

1082
01:11:19,727 --> 01:11:21,609
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kids shooting each other.

1083
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,070
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1084
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:50,655
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1085
01:12:15,111 --> 01:12:15,932
[SPEAKER_04]: and Last Blade II.

1086
01:12:31,552 --> 01:12:46,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really exactly when the exact time frame is in Japan, because there's references to the Shinsengumi, to fighting for the Shogun, so I would assume it's right.

1087
01:12:46,557 --> 01:12:50,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And from what I can tell from the characters in the game, it's sort of right around that transitional period.

1088
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:54,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really just, you've got people who use different weapons.

1089
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,901
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the guys who worked on...

1090
01:13:00,925 --> 01:13:03,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Guilty Gear actually helped develop this game, too.

1091
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:07,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really, really good.

1092
01:13:07,372 --> 01:13:12,097
[SPEAKER_04]: You've also got your choice of using power or speed.

1093
01:13:12,637 --> 01:13:14,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have a stronger, slower character.

1094
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:16,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have someone who's weaker but faster.

1095
01:13:17,342 --> 01:13:21,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you've got your attacks and combos that incorporate all of that.

1096
01:13:22,268 --> 01:13:22,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1097
01:13:24,304 --> 01:13:27,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I just really think that it's a very nice game.

1098
01:13:27,228 --> 01:13:38,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the other things that it brought into it was a deflect where you could block a move and then you would be able to instantly attack.

1099
01:13:39,756 --> 01:13:43,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was a pretty neat function as well.

1100
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:50,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Last Blade was the first SNK game to bring in super cancels into its gameplay.

1101
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:56,171
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got desperation moves, super moves, all kinds of stuff.

1102
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,593
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really, really a fun game.

1103
01:13:58,873 --> 01:13:59,954
[SPEAKER_04]: The series is fun.

1104
01:14:00,955 --> 01:14:03,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing I like about the music is...

1105
01:14:05,302 --> 01:14:07,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty, I guess, almost on the classical end.

1106
01:14:07,524 --> 01:14:20,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things I really liked about it, and this is going to sound kind of cheeseball, is that when you go into each stage, you sort of have a little cutscene in the top corner that sets up the area you're playing in.

1107
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:27,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's really cool, not just for the story, the characters themselves, but the environments in the game.

1108
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,802
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1109
01:14:55,067 --> 01:15:02,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say there was... I'm trying to remember the character that I played the most because I played the one who dressed up as her brother.

1110
01:15:04,711 --> 01:15:06,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't remember the character.

1111
01:15:06,551 --> 01:15:07,572
[SPEAKER_00]: You played a cross-dresser?

1112
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:08,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

1113
01:15:09,232 --> 01:15:16,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say there was another game that's out there that sold one point... It was Kojiro, sorry.

1114
01:15:16,355 --> 01:15:17,035
[SPEAKER_04]: 0.18 million now for Eye of Judgment.

1115
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:24,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Never gonna happen.

1116
01:15:25,531 --> 01:15:26,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Never gonna happen.

1117
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:30,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well there you have it.

1118
01:15:30,775 --> 01:15:33,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight's classic game of the week, The Last Blade.

1119
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:35,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the whole damn series.

01:15:35,879 --> 01:15:36,620
[SPEAKER_00]: On every platform.

1121
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Neo Geo, Dreamcast, there's one on Dreamcast, right?

1122
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:39,342
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Dreamcast.

1123
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:41,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that there were PS2 versions.

1124
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:46,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to say that there were, but of course the Dreamcast one was like, beautiful.

1125
01:15:47,588 --> 01:15:51,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so we'll say the Dreamcast version then, because you're such a Dreamcast fan.

1126
01:15:53,879 --> 01:16:16,045
[SPEAKER_00]: really everything alright so check that out The Last Blade that's going to bring our part A to a close tonight so we're going to take a break and we'll be back though never fear with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
