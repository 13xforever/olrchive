00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this Part B of our podcast.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
It is March 30, 2008.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
We are live at orangeloungeradio.com.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Some changes coming very soon in our future.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
If you haven't heard about them yet, make sure you're listening to both parts of Orange Lounge Radio every week from our podcast feed.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
More information is available over at orangeloungeradio.com.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
If you missed Part A, you missed us talking about PlayStation stuff and some of the things coming to Xbox Live,

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
like Darwinian, some Ikaruga, and the Penny Arcade game.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Now we're going to get into some Wii news, and we'll start off with Loki.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And also, if you didn't listen to Part A, then you're a witch!

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Yes, you're a witch!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Damn you.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Coming to the Wii, and this is a big shock here.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Rock Band was announced for the Wii.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
They're going to be getting the special edition, otherwise known as the one with all the instruments.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
And that is coming to retailers June 22 for the small sum of $170.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Yes, that's almost the price of a Wii console.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
And, of course, there are a few things you should know about it.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
For one, the drum is white.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
And number two, it's going to contain five bonus songs.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
That's only because there are absolutely no downloads for this.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Wah wah.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, so, much like the PlayStation 2 version, there are no downloads for at least this version of Rock Band.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
So sad.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Let's see what other stuff...

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh, the instruments are all going to be very similar to the other systems.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
You don't need to use your Wii mote in any way with these.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
They're all going to be USB.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
And it will come with the powered USB hub, much like the Xbox 360 release.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Did you really...

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
I mean, honestly, people out there, did you really think that Rock Band on the Wii was going to have download content?

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I mean, did you really think that because, where would they put it?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Seriously.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
The only other thing they could do is already have it on the disc, and then you download little unlock codes, but that would piss people off even more.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah, it would piss people off.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
The thing I would, I don't know, maybe download it to SD memory cards.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Really, I think that's what it's going to take, you know, somehow make your own file formats.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
Because I know that Nintendo has their stupid block set up for, you know, game saves and stuff like that.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
But it doesn't necessarily mean, you know, programs have to use that.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
I mean, if you look at it, you know, Smash Brothers has its own save data.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
You know, Excite Truck and Endless Ocean use MP3s.

03:04.000 --> 03:12.000
So, who's to say that you couldn't make some sort of like, I don't know, independent file format and have it work only saves to SD memory cards?

03:12.000 --> 03:21.000
Hell, you can make it, like, you purchase it online, download it off your PC to an SD memory card or something like that, and then that's how you play with it.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
Because right now, the way they've got their download content set up, well, there is no way to do download content.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Just, Nintendo's that far behind the game.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Dream on, on all that stuff, by the way.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Just dream on.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I'm sorry, I was choking on toast.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
You know, honestly, what my honest reaction, though, was when I heard that news about Rock Band being on the Wii?

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
I actually, I was like, I thought it was already on the Wii.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Because, seriously, Rock Band's on, like, every system, just like Guitar Hero and all that stuff.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I thought Rock Band was already on the Wii.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
But I, of course, did not make that my system of choice, because I knew it wouldn't have the download songs, and I knew it wouldn't be probably quite the graphical quality of the other versions.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
I can't wait until they shoehorn it onto the DS.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm sure that's just a matter of time, huh?

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
That would be insane. It would have to use Wi-Fi, I think.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
You could do the drums with the stylus. Tap, tap, tap, tap.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I guess that would work.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Maybe make use of that Guitar Hero expansion.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Probably not, though.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
You would have a separate guitar that wouldn't be compatible with the other one.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Just you wait.

04:23.000 --> 04:31.000
Well, if singing is more your thing, it could be very soon that a SingStar-type clone is coming to the Wii.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
It looks like it's called JoySound.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
Apparently, Hudson is making this game called JoySound.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
It's going to be something that you can actually get on WiiWare.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
You'll download this JoySound thing, and you get it from a server that's being exclusively set up for that, whatever that is.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
But here's the trick with it.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Instead of having to pay for individual songs, you subscribe to it.

04:55.000 --> 05:04.000
They're hoping to release it this summer in Japan. It's going to have 20,000 songs available at launch, 1,000 more every month.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
If they have that, I'm sorry, but that's sad for SingStar, especially when they're touting that they're going to have this huge, long thing.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
And Karaoke Revolution.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
And Karaoke Revolution.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
Well, actually, here's the funny thing. It's Hudson that's putting it up there.

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
So imagine, if you will, they could do something like this and brand it with Karaoke Revolution, and boom, there you go.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
You know, bring that over to the US.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
But with 20,000 songs, I can't help but think it's just going to be like MIDI songs.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
You know what I mean? The quality of the songs is going to be really crap.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
You'd be surprised.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
MP3s, I mean, they could do it that way.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
I mean, that wouldn't be that hard.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
But I don't know.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
I actually think it's kind of a neat setup and it's a different way of trying to do things.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Again, it all depends on price.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
Because that could be a pretty kick-ass party game if you have all those songs available and they can download relatively quickly.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
That might be a pretty big deal.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
So we'll see.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
I'd be curious to see what that plays out like in Japan and if it's even going to come out over here.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
We will find out.

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
Well, for our friends in the UK, there are three releases for Virtual Console.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
Actually, what's pretty cool is there were Commodore 64 releases for the European Virtual Console.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I thought that that would interest Rob.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Absolutely.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
One of them is International Karate, which is basically what it sounds like.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
It's a karate game on the Commodore 64.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
I know a lot of people liked it. It wasn't really my thing, but it was one of their earlier fighting games.

06:49.000 --> 06:58.000
Also to come out was Uridium, which was a Commodore 64 shooter that was a horizontal scroller but was fairly unique from what I understand.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
I remember Uridium very vaguely, but I did play that.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
You're fighting aliens and stuff.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
It apparently has elements from Gradius and Defender and a few others that are on there.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
It's actually 500 Wii points.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
Before I forget to mention, International Karate is also 500 Wii points.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
I'm really curious how those Commodore 64 games are going to translate over on the Wii.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm really curious to check that out.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
The other game that is out is Cruis'n USA.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
It was a Nintendo 64 game for 1,000 Wii points.

07:35.000 --> 07:44.000
It's Cruis'n USA. It probably still controls just as badly and is still just as weird as it was before.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
What was it, Cruis'n USA?

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
I'm trying to remember Cruis'n USA on the Nintendo 64.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I don't remember it was very good.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
GS68 says I wouldn't buy Cruis'n USA for even 100 Wii points.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
Actually, no, I'm thinking of Rush the Rock.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Rush the Rock was okay.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
They had that on the Nintendo 64, and no, that wasn't very good.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Cruis'n USA, no, that probably wasn't very good either.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Cruis'n World was a lot better.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
California Speed, not very good either.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
In fact, all the games made by Midway that were racing, not very good.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Hydro Thunder. I love Hydro Thunder.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
The Thunder games were good.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Hydro Thunder was brilliant, especially on Dreamcast.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
I can only play that game in the arcades. I can't play it on console.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
No way. We had it on Dreamcast.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
No way way.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I'll tell you what, it sucked on most PlayStation games.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
It sucked ass on PlayStation.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
That's it.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
In Japan, you're going to be able to get one of the games that Jamie's been super excited about for a while.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
Rondo of Blood, or Dracula X Rondo of Blood is coming to the Japanese Virtual Console.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Yes, that is the Turbo Duo version.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
No word on how much it's going to cost you, but hey, that's pretty awesome.

09:00.000 --> 09:11.000
And unfortunately, I don't think we're going to see it come over here because it would need to be localized and no one wants to spend any time on something like that.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
But if you can play the Japanese version, awesome!

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, all the cutscenes had text on them. All they'd have to do is translate the text and not worry about the dialogue.

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
Well, that's still effort, and you remember they don't want to put effort into these games.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
RawstealUT in chat points out the game is already localized, PSP version.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
That is true.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
It is true, and so that wouldn't be that hard, but once again, it takes a little bit of effort to change all the text.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, isn't the PSP version all graphed up, too? It's all super graphics now?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
But they have the original one on there, too?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yes, they do.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Oh, okay.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Do they?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I don't know.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
But I think the original one, wasn't it Dracula X?

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I mean, it's not the new Rondo or the...

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah, while these guys get Dracula X Rondo of Blood, you know what we'll get on US Virtual Console?

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
This stupid, crappy, poo version.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
No, it came out over here as Dracula X on Super Nintendo.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I thought it was our Castlevania V.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
No, it was...

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
Because the Dracula X series doesn't necessarily fall in with the actual Castlevania games.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Only there was a Castlevania V.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
No, there was a Castlevania V, I swear to God.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
We did get a Castlevania V, but it wasn't Dracula X.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
Castlevania V, in fact, I do believe it was re-released with the Castlevania Chronicles.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
But I'm fairly positive that it was not Dracula X.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
Then you're right, I must be crazy. I could have sworn it was Castlevania V we got here.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Huh.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Because they were Super Castlevania IV and I don't remember one after that.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
I think Castlevania V came out on PlayStation, if I'm remembering right.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Sorry.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
No, Castlevania 64 was the next action.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm just crazy, it's fine.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Castlevania 64 does not exist.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It's not worth losing sleep over.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
It does not exist to you? It's dead to you?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Dead to me.

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
And to Dark Tetsuya, technically Dracula XX was Nocturne in the Moonlight, which we got over here as Symphony of the Night.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
Alright, well, some other systems games are making its way to the Virtual Console on the Nintendo Wii very soon.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
It's the Sega Master System.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
And we mentioned this a couple shows ago, but now it is official.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
They are making their way to the North American Virtual Console and they're going to cost 400 points a game.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
So it makes it the cheapest system of any of them out there.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
There's only going to be four bucks a game.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
The NES games are five bucks a pop.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
Two of the first games that are going to be coming out that should be out soon, that probably means any week now,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Wonder Boy and Fantasy Zone are going to be the first two that come out.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Fantasy Zone, of course, was one of the classic games of the week.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
That's right.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Well, Fantasy Zone is a good game, too.

12:00.000 --> 12:09.000
I mean, I don't know if the Sega Master System port of it is my favorite, but, you know, it is, for four bucks, probably not a bad deal.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
So, we'll see what other types of Sega Master System games show up very soon.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I need to correct myself.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Symphony of the Night was X2.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
XX was the Super Nintendo released in Japan.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Too confusing.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Damn them for releasing, like, completely different games over here in the US than they did over there.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
You know what I mean?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Damn them.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Damn the man.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
They just should have brought it out over here.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
It was so...

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Well, I've had it on this show before.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
We hooked it up through the old setup.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Oh, very few people will remember that.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
That was years ago.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And did screen captures and everything through the webcam.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
And it was the whole German intro and everything.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
But anyway, I like Fantasy Zone, by the way.

12:50.000 --> 12:58.000
So, another wonderful, wonderful game is going to be remade for WiiWare.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
That's pretty cool.

12:59.000 --> 13:08.000
And that is going to be one of the best pinball simulating games ever is Alien Crush.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
And you can actually download Alien Crush right now and play it on Virtual Console.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
But it's really, really, really happy.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
So far, there's only, of course, note for it being out in Japan.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
But we could get it.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I really hope that we do.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Hopefully Hudson loves us.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
Although, honestly, I would prefer to have Devil's Crush myself.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
What happens to...

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
Because I have the original Alien Crush, so I guess I'm just going to have to have two.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
What I'm understanding from this screen capture I'm seeing on here is that instead of the top-down view,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
you actually have a slightly more diagonal overhead.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
Kind of like more traditional, or I shouldn't say more traditional, more newer.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
You know what I mean?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Shut up.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
The current types of pinball games look like this.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Like an actual table.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah, it's more of an actual table layout.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
But Alien Crush is still pretty sexy.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Extra fruity, happy to know that.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
He played a whole crap load of Alien Crush.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Oh my god, I think he played that game for an entire day once.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
And I still meant to bring over my Turbo Duo so he could play Devil's Crush at the time, but now it's out.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
And now he's not my roommate anymore, so...

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Tear.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Maybe he'll get a Wii at some point, though, and buy the game to relive those memories all over again.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
We'll see.

14:39.000 --> 14:47.000
Fortunately, one thing he's not going to have made available to him is one of the brand new features to Club Nintendo.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
That is a memory card that you can get, an SD memory card.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
128 megs worth of music from different Nintendo games.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
And some of the songs that they have on there, of course.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
Songs from Super Mario Sunshine, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Catch Touch Yoshi.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
That's kind of a weird name.

15:08.000 --> 15:16.000
Nintendogs, Mario Kart Double Dash, Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker, Pikmin 2, and Super Mario Brothers.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
And, of course, Club Nintendo is exclusively Japanese, and they get all sorts of cool stuff,

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
including, you know, what is it, classic controllers that look like Super Famicom controllers,

15:28.000 --> 15:36.000
and DS games for the Game & Watch stuff, and that stupid Tingle balloon fight game.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
So this is an official Nintendo product.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yes.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Yet we know Nintendo kind of hates the SD card, so this thing is so weird to me.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I wouldn't say they hate the SD card.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I mean, they put damn SD...

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
But they just use it for the weirdest stuff, you know what I mean?

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
Like, the most obvious things, like extra storage, they don't use it for, but this...

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
I mean, like, what would you really use this on?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Like, custom songs?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
So you can play these songs in Excite Truck.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Whoopee!

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
How many people remember Excite Truck?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
You and who else?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Me!

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
And who else?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Nelly!

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Exether.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Kate, you, your wife, and who else?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Exether.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Fine.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
Hey, I can't help it if Excite Truck is the greatest racing game on the Wii ever.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Until Excite Truck 2 comes out.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Please, Nintendo.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Sooner than later.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
Alright, well guess what kind of story I've got for you guys right now.

16:29.000 --> 16:37.000
That's right, when you hear that music, you know something really tragic has happened.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
And that is that another person has been killed over video games.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Or at least that's what the media wants you to believe.

16:44.000 --> 16:54.000
A 15-year-old boy was killed by his 18-year-old friend, William Suarez, because he refused

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
to hand over the video game he was playing.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
So, uh, what did Suarez do?

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
He whipped out a.32 caliber Smith and Wesson from his waistband.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Not Mommy and Daddy's closet, not under the bed.

17:07.000 --> 17:14.000
He whipped it out from his waistband and shot his 15-year-old friend in the head.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
What is this world coming to?

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
The killer is 18 years old.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
He's been charged with manslaughter, illegal possession of a firearm, assault with a dangerous

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
weapon, and discharging a firearm within.500 feet of the dwelling.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Why manslaughter?

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
I mean, I would think murder, if anything, because he intended to kill him.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
How about when you think, oh, a bullet wound to the head, that'll scare him.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Just give him the chair.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Just give him the chair already.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
A quote from the article, witnesses told authorities that Suarez then put the gun down on the kitchen

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
counter and began saying, this just didn't happen.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
So, kind of like he went crazy or something, I don't know.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Now, here's the question.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Did video games really have anything to do with this?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
No.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Not really.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
No.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
But yet, here are the headlines that are coming out.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Family.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Game led to teen's murder.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Video game linked to fatal shooting in Brockton.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
More like, Psycho killed kid.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
End of story.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
It's sad.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
It would be the same thing as if he had a Furby a few years ago.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Or a Tickle Me Elmo or whatever the fuck it was called.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
You know what they need to do to this kid?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
They need to burn him.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Because he's a witch!

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
No, he's much, much worse than that.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Being a witch is not bad.

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
Being a psycho murderer is.

18:53.000 --> 19:04.000
You see, I thought he had two lives, and so that's why I didn't know he would be dead forever.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
Thank you news media, by the way, for blowing this story completely out of proportion.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
I mean, it's sad, and it's fucked up, and it shouldn't have happened.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Way to take the high road.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
But was it the video game's fault, or was it because the kid was a loon?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
What video game was it?

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
It doesn't even say. Does it matter?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Does it really matter?

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
I mean, I guess if it was Grand Theft Auto or something, you'd go, oh yeah, another one of those.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
But if it was something like Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen go shopping, or Imagine Babies or something,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
then that would be kind of interesting.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Bitch, come back for Imagine Babies.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Alright.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
It's not funny. I'm not laughing at that, I swear.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Alright. No, it really isn't funny.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
You are too.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
It's not funny. I don't know.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
It's sick.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And it makes me angsty.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
You know, after those types of stories, you know this part of the show is coming up.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
The F years of the week.

20:02.000 --> 20:18.000
This is fucked up.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Is that an F you to the ferret?

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
No, the ferret had to get a few things out from being stuck in your closet for how long.

20:24.000 --> 20:32.000
Um, F you to, um, well I don't really want to say F you to California Burger, because really all I wanted was the pastrami.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
But they didn't give me the burger that was supposed to go with the pastrami.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
And I feel deprived of meat.

20:38.000 --> 20:48.000
So, F you to that, and um, F you to my lack of fundage for the present.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
A big F you poopy ball to that.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
F you to money.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Well, I mean, money is just F you to lack of money.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Yeah.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Logan.

20:57.000 --> 21:10.000
F you to people who drive big trucks that can't figure out where in the lane they're supposed to be because, you know, for some reason when people need to make a left turn, they start heading towards the right and cutting into my lane and then they make their left turn because their truck is too big.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
It's not my fault you bought a big truck. Doesn't mean you have to run me off the road.

21:15.000 --> 21:29.000
My F you of the week goes to the fact that I'm about to enter my fourth week of having pains that float around my abdomen, my back, my stomach, and no one knows what's wrong with me still.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
I had a blood test on Tuesday. I'm still waiting on the results.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I'm going for alien chest popper.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
God, I hope not.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Although I guess that would be kind of cool.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
I mean, if I'm going to go, let's go out with a bang like that and why not, huh?

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
But it's very frustrating.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
I'm really frustrated with the way my doctor is handling things.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
What's that?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Did you have the special?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
No, I did not have the special.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
All right, let's move back into some gaming news.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
Jamie, please take us away from Angstville.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
Well, this might still make people angsty.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Sorry, but I didn't make it.

22:06.000 --> 22:19.000
GameStop is not going to be carrying Game Boy and Game Boy Color stuff, games, systems, crap that goes with it, hoping to have it all wiped out by the end of April.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
I didn't know they were still carrying Game Boy.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
Yeah, I know. I'm not angsty about it. I'm surprised they still got it.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Well, you can always go to Game Crazy for that stuff.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
Or Plain Trade or any other mom and pops out there.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
Or buy yourself a freaking Game Boy Advance and get with the times already. Jesus.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
But there were some really, really good games that were old Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
But those old games will work on Game Boy Advance.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
They will, but if they're not going to be selling the games, you have to go to the little trader places.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
All right, fair enough.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
I do have to admit, one of the cutest Game Boys I ever had, I don't know why I gave it to my sister.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
That was the stupidest thing I ever did.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
But I had a Game Boy Color that when you turned it on, it had a little Pikachu around the power thing.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
And so it looked like his cheeks lit up because the power was on.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Maybe it was Pichu, not Pikachu, but you know what I mean.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
I had a pink Game Boy Advance.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
How girly.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
And this is me who isn't like the uber girly girl.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I just wanted a pink one.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I think I wanted them because they were hard to get.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Mine was clear and has no backlight.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Well, we put a backlight in mine.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
I had to use those stupid little reading light things that would clip to the top so you could actually see the screen.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Ah, Nintendo.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
I had a friend put an afterburner in mine.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
I think he was just happy about having a chance to take apart something technological.

23:46.000 --> 23:56.000
Well, you may not be able to get Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but one game you will be able to get probably pretty soon is the sequel to 50 Cent Bulletproof.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Yes, it's a brand new game.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
50 Cent to Blood in the Sand.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
And my god is it shit.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
It's basically, if I remember the premise of it correct,

24:11.000 --> 24:20.000
Fiddy goes to the Middle East to perform for somebody and the promoter doesn't have the money to pay him.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
So instead of paying him money, he pays him in a diamond encrusted skull.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
Which gets stolen by, I can only assume, terrorists.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
And then it's up to Fiddy to get the skull back.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
If that's not a more ridiculous plot, I don't know.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
But here's the funny thing though.

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
I kind of think that's pretty neat because let's just go the completely ridiculous route with the whole entire game.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I mean, that's the way it should be.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
Just completely take the storyline just to unbelievable like, you know, where he has to go in a space shuttle somewhere to save the moon or something.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
Dark Tetsuya says, please tell me this is an early April Fool's Day joke.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
I'm afraid it's not.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I almost kind of want to agree.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't know though.

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
You do bring up an interesting point, Loki, is that if it's almost like self-parody or something, it's actually kind of funny.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
But I don't think it is.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
I think he's trying to make it out like, dude, it's 50 Cent fighting terrorists.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
How much more American do you need?

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
I mean, he shits red, white, and blue.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
That's how American it is.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
It's like, you know, no more taking on gang bangers.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
It's now time to take on terrorists.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Hurrah.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah, I don't know.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
And people will buy it.

25:36.000 --> 25:46.000
I mean, the first thing I thought of when I heard there was a sequel to this game is I thought, you mean Bulletproof 1 sold enough copies to necessitate this?

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
What the hell?

25:49.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure I have the correct name for all this stuff.

25:58.000 --> 26:06.000
I am pretty positive that was the actual plot to this.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
I wonder if this is trying to be like, you know how some movies are so bad they're actually kind of good, like Showgirls?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
This is going to be like the Showgirls of video gaming.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
It's so bad, it's pretty funny.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Hey, Rob.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
What?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
You are a whore.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
You made me sit down and watch that movie and I love it.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Because it's awesome.

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
I guess Bulletproof sold, it was a multi-million dollar, or multi-million copies selling game.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
I don't remember it selling more than one.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Who's buying it?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I don't know.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
Blend of the Sand is something more exotic, more Hollywood blockbuster.

26:41.000 --> 26:49.000
This game sets 50's character against a cabal of international gangsters on a far flung bullet ridden adventure.

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
They say it's inspired by three kings meets lock stock and two smoking barrels.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
It's definitely a crime story.

26:57.000 --> 27:04.000
The developer credited 50 with pushing the game's creators to consider novel locations

27:04.000 --> 27:15.000
and said that MC played a big part in crafting the game's still secret story.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
I don't know.

27:16.000 --> 27:24.000
And I guess the game will run on the Unreal 3 engine because every other fucking game on the face of the earth runs on the Unreal 3 engine.

27:24.000 --> 27:34.000
And will allow you to have co-op, drop in, drop out of co-op play, and other people will be able to be one of the other three members of the G unit.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Tony Yao, Wu Kid, and Lloyd Banks.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
That is way too many frills for a game like this.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
What in the hell?

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
I don't know.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
It's interesting.

27:47.000 --> 27:54.000
Qualtippo in chat says, let us not forget that Cars was one of, if not the best selling game of 2006.

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
You know, we have to remember folks that are really into gaming and the hobbyists like we are and probably the folks listening to this program,

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
we're not often times the largest market share of who's buying these games.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
There's not a lot of games out there for the urban market.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
And stuff like this does do really well, actually.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
So, it's just crazy.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Even this?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Even this?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
This?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
But here's the thing.

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
It sounds like they're actually putting some effort into the game because, I mean, the first one was pretty cinematic.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
It was just kind of retarded.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
But this one, being that it's on the Unreal 3 engine, stuff like that, I mean, I don't know.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
I have to see how it looks.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
But yeah, the whole thing sounds ridiculous.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
All right.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
We'll see.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
Well, one thing we won't be seeing much more of for sure.

28:42.000 --> 28:50.000
Here's the thing. Do you remember last week we talked about that Target was selling these indie gaming shirts and that they actually came with the game on the shirt?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
They already got pulled from shelves.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Really?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Yep.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
They already have been pulled from shelves because unfortunately they just weren't selling.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
What?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
They gave it like a week.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
It's not working out.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
I guess they measure that stuff day by day.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
The local Target buyers have those actually.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Really?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
The one birdcage.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
Unfortunately, they were selling less than what Target thought was good enough to keep it on the store.

29:14.000 --> 29:21.000
The distributors are going to try, again though, they're going to try Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic as the months will go on.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
So who knows?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
But I imagine the shirts will be more expensive.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
They should try GameStop.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
I mean, I know I hate to push GameStop, but I mean...

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Or other game box stores.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Yeah, Gaming Chains.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
That would be the perfect...

29:33.000 --> 29:40.000
Or, I don't know, allow them to be purchased on their website from independent retailers out there.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
That would be the way to do it, I would think.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
All right.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Well, hey, it's time for that part of the show where we hear back from you guys.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
One of many, because of course we have the chat, we have the Skype line, but we also have the mailbag.

29:51.000 --> 29:59.000
And every week we like to read through the emails and answer those of you guys that are brave enough to write us at mailbag at orangeloungeloungeradio.com.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
DarkStalker is going to jump in the mailbag and pull out a few of her favorite emails for us to hear this week.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
But as I understand, I don't think there were a whole lot of emails this week.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
No, only a few.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Depressing.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
Wow, hey, we got some spam in the interim as well.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Hooray.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
And another couple of emails.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
So actually I might just be generous and read the two new ones that came in as well.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
So starting off, this one says,

30:23.000 --> 30:31.000
Hi, all. First, sorry for not contacting you before, but I have been listening to your show via iTunes podcasts for about 18 months.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Big fan of DarkSakura.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Oh, thank you.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
And wouldn't like to miss hearing her every week.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Aww, thank you.

30:37.000 --> 30:52.000
So on that note, have you ever looked into using, I guess it's ustream.tv, stickam.com with chat, plus storage for shows and have been used by Leah Laporte for TWITV?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
This week in tech.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Yeah, okay.

30:55.000 --> 31:02.000
Well, basically it lists a whole bunch of other things, but as we've announced earlier in the show, we've got our plan.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
Yes, and ustream.tv actually, we actually have a channel on ustream.tv.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
We just never used it.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
We actually, we were originally going to go with ustream.tv.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
We made a last minute decision to switch to Justin.tv.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
That was after the operator 11 fallout, because I remember we were using them for a little while.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
So I'd actually created the ustream.tv account with the intention of going over there.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
But I don't know, there was something about Justin.tv I just liked a little better.

31:24.000 --> 31:31.000
Oh, I think I, I like the way you could, that fans could go in and cut out the highlight clips that you could upload things to YouTube and import things from YouTube.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
I felt Justin.tv had a little more of the functionality.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
And ustream, ustream seemed a little too big for me.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
You know what I mean?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
This is a lot more interactive, I think.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Yeah, I like Justin.tv a little more.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
It seemed a little more homely.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Yeah, it's a little more cozy.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
I like that.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
Well, just to continue with the email, also talkshoe.com does live audio broadcast with chat room.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
But it needs to be downloaded first order to use live server.

31:55.000 --> 32:00.000
And you can also record the shows as you do them, which are available in the show archive.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
I hope that helps.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
If not, sorry and hope you find a solution soon.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
All the best, Steve in the UK.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Well, hopefully you'll be pleased with the earlier news about our solution.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
We're pretty excited about it.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Voltron!

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Which is pretty much sort of what we had kind of thought already.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Mm-hmm.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Next email.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Hello, gentlemen and lady.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I just watched Dead Fantasy II.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I want you guys...

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
I know you guys have seen the first one.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
It's nothing compared to the second.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
I just think that it's amazing that someone could do this in their spare time.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
I've looked at it several times now and can't help but wonder what Dark Soccer thought.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Well, I haven't seen it yet.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
I know she loves her fighting games in Final Fantasy.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Monty Om, I guess that's how it's pronounced,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
has said that there are at least five more in the series.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
but I've got a few questions.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
With the latest surprising characters, who do you think might make an appearance next?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
And finally, which side will win in the end?

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
Seems the Final Fantasy team has an unfair advantage by using both weapons and magic.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I'll be surprised if they win, though.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
Lastly, I don't have the time to listen to the show live,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
but I've always downloaded the podcast.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
It seems that there are always regular live listeners to support the show.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
If you guys can find a suitable alternative to Live 365,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
then how about a fundraiser?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I know it sounds a bit corny,

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
but I've come to like the show very much

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
and would hate to see any changes that would cripple the community that has grown around it.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
I'd be more than willing to donate money to keep the show going,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
and I'm sure most of the live listeners would as well.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Thanks for getting me through a rough day.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
This is from Recimo.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
And to be honest, we disagree with what Live 365 is doing,

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
and it's more or less the point that we don't want to support what they're doing,

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
no matter if we can afford it or not, right?

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Whoa, the FU music came in there. Sorry about that.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I was like, where the hell is that music going?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Yeah, it's appropriate, so it's all right.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
Again, thank you for the wonderful offer,

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
but we have another plan that we think will help actually grow our community a little bit.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
By the way, Jamie, here's a little sneak peek of Dead Fantasy II,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
which shows the...

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
It's basically, I did watch some of it.

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
I mean, it's just one giant fanboy orgasm in video form.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
It's what it is for all.

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
It's just special effect after special effect after chicks beating the crap out of each other,

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
explosions, falling bricks.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
I mean, biting down a giant spike TV should just show this all day long, honestly.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
I think I'm going to watch that one again.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
People would be happy.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I see dead or alive people.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Yeah, well, it's dead or alive.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
It's just one giant fanboy orgasm.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
It's crazy.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Riku just got thrown in that clip there.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
That's lovely.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Anyway, sorry, I know that makes for a horrible radio,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
but I wanted to show Jamie a little clip of that.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
That's completely awesome.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
You got an email from Hero Antagonist, which was a link,

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
and it said, this seemed like something you'd want to see if you haven't already.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
It's like a bizarre twist between DDR Beatmania and a slot machine,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
which we've covered earlier.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Oh, well, there you have it then.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
The Beatmania Pachi slot.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
So that was pretty cool.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
Also, we got an email from GS68.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It says, hey, OLR crew.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
I'm sure you'll recall at least twice getting emails from a blind gamer named Ranma from India.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
I have something for him, that is, if he's still listening to the show.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
I'm not sure if you've seen this yet, but on YouTube there's a blind gamer who goes by the nick

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
Geniuses Corruption, who has played through Zelda Ocarina of Time,

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Zelda Twilight Princess, and Castlevania Circle of the Moon,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
and posted videos of his conquests.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
You can see his page.

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
It's, again, Geniuses Corruption, Geniuses being plural.

35:48.000 --> 35:54.000
Given that he has proven he is blind through the front page video of him beating a boss blindfolded,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
it just goes to show that even blind gamers can play video games.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
To Ranma of India, you are not alone.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
There are other gamers out there who are born blind and they play video games, so can you.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
That's from GS68.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I watched it. It was actually pretty cool.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
The game he was playing in, oh crap, I lost the link.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
I closed it, sorry.

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
But he was playing through a GameCube game and doing fairly decently.

36:20.000 --> 36:28.000
Cheeseburger sent us a giant ASCII finger that says to Live 365.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Thank you, Cheeseburger.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
That was very nice ASCII art. I was very impressed.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
J-Rod emailed one of the two that we got recently.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
Hi, OLR crew. Love the show. Keep up the awesome job.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
What I was writing about was concerning deeper characters and themes in video games

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
and how long do you think it will be before we actually start seeing this type of stuff in games.

36:49.000 --> 36:55.000
We were recently seeing a much greater character portrayal in writing with emotions like love with games like Mass Effect and others.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.000
I would like to see deep and mature storylines involving other things and emotions that are

37:00.000 --> 37:07.000
quote, too hot for video games to deal with like racism, sexism, homosexuality, and various other things.

37:07.000 --> 37:14.000
American History X and Schindler's List are very powerful, well done films that deal with very mature subjects and are in good taste.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
It seems like companies such as Rockstar putting out games like Manhunt are actually setting us backwards

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
when it comes to being taken seriously compared to other forms of entertainment like movies and books

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
and that mature games that deal with big issues aren't going to happen anytime soon.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
Am I thinking too negatively about this? What do you guys think?

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Would you like to play games that deal with these themes in a tasteful way?

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
This email is sponsored by Olive Garden, home of the Never Ending Salads and Breadsticks.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
Of course. That's a really good thought.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Japanese games have been doing it for a while.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
I would love to play these types of games. I think it would be a lot of fun.

37:52.000 --> 37:59.000
Unfortunately, you only really see it in the occasional role playing game that has the more mature themes, but I think it would be fun.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
I just don't think they'd sell well is the unfortunate thing.

38:02.000 --> 38:10.000
In Hollywood, you can make a big budget movie, lots of special effects and explosions.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
You can make a big budget movie or you can make a small budget movie that cost a lot less to make.

38:14.000 --> 38:22.000
Usually, those types of movies that address those themes are the small budget movies, your Oscar-winning types of movies.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Those things are usually the small little independent stuff.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
While in the gaming world, you have the big budget stuff and the small budget stuff,

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
the small budget stuff usually tends to be indie stuff, that A, doesn't get a lot of exposure,

38:37.000 --> 38:41.160
And B, usually the indie stuff is innovating on different types of gameplay, not necessarily

38:41.160 --> 38:45.600
new themes in game formats that we've already seen, if that makes sense.

38:45.600 --> 38:50.520
Because when you talk about exploring those types of themes, well, you can't really do

38:50.520 --> 38:53.920
a lot of that in a puzzle game.

38:53.920 --> 38:57.600
You're talking about types of games that are really involved with story, so that's basically

38:57.600 --> 38:59.680
RPG and those types of games.

38:59.680 --> 39:07.740
You don't see a lot of really polished indie efforts in those realms, if that makes sense.

39:07.740 --> 39:10.600
So I think that's why you're right, it's going to be a long time, unfortunately, before we

39:10.600 --> 39:11.680
see something like this.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.920
And what it's going to take is it's going to take video games getting even bigger and

39:14.920 --> 39:21.240
bigger so that more and more money and there's more budgets for different types of experiments

39:21.240 --> 39:22.480
and try things.

39:22.480 --> 39:26.600
But I think it would be great to have some of those things you mentioned.

39:26.600 --> 39:34.840
Well, like I said, quite a few games have come out overseas that dealt with deeper topics,

39:34.840 --> 39:39.280
but we won't get them over here.

39:39.280 --> 39:43.040
Last email from Mr. D.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.720
Big wave from across the pond to Sky Dark Sakura and Loki.

39:45.720 --> 39:50.360
I'm a UK listener who occasionally listens live and am as I write this.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.360
Oh, cool.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.360
Hi.

39:52.360 --> 39:56.520
Yeah, I must be crazy since the show starts about 1 to 2 a.m. here, but I often find my

39:56.520 --> 40:00.600
self not getting a lot of sleep during the early hours of Monday morning due to having

40:00.600 --> 40:01.960
frequent uni deadlines.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.440
Your show keeps me going, so thanks.

40:05.440 --> 40:10.840
Anyway, Dark Sakura's talk of grandia reminded me of something I've been thinking about previously,

40:10.840 --> 40:12.800
memorable RPG moments.

40:12.800 --> 40:13.800
My memory of-

40:13.800 --> 40:15.400
Damn, that was fast.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.400
Yeah.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.840
You just brought up grandia like an hour ago.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.880
That's instant gratification there, you go.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.880
All right, sorry.

40:21.880 --> 40:26.440
My memory of grandia is really patchy and I found the crossing of the wall that makes,

40:26.440 --> 40:29.840
that marks the end of the world to be very memorable.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.600
What are your most memorable RPG scenes?

40:32.600 --> 40:36.360
To stop right there, that's one of them.

40:36.360 --> 40:42.400
Actually, the whole ghost ship part in grandia I thought was really, really just awesome.

40:42.400 --> 40:46.240
I hate to be cliche, but come on, the whole-

40:46.240 --> 40:47.240
Opera.

40:47.240 --> 40:53.640
Well, the opera in six, but the you know who dies in Final Fantasy VII was really emotional

40:53.640 --> 40:55.440
and a really big step in games at that time.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.920
I hate to be cliche, but that really is the one that comes to mind.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.800
It was really emotional for me too, Rob.

40:59.800 --> 41:00.800
You emotional overjoyed.

41:00.800 --> 41:07.440
I cheered so loudly and I was like, yes, and I still to this day have my card with the

41:07.440 --> 41:13.560
stupid hoe bag's death saved on it because I laughed my ass off and I spend the whole

41:13.560 --> 41:19.280
time screaming at Jenova so I can get to that part and watch the death.

41:19.280 --> 41:23.080
I'll give an answer that maybe the guy wasn't looking for, but I'll kind of take it in a

41:23.080 --> 41:24.080
different direction.

41:24.080 --> 41:27.240
I'm going to say games like World of Warcraft.

41:27.240 --> 41:30.680
When you do things with your guild, like for instance, I have a guild of mostly people

41:30.680 --> 41:32.040
I know offline.

41:32.040 --> 41:35.640
We have maybe a handful of OLR listeners in there, but not a few, even though I've plugged

41:35.640 --> 41:36.640
it like a million times.

41:36.640 --> 41:38.040
I guess you all don't want to play WoW with us.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.040
That's fine.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.040
See if I care.

41:40.040 --> 41:44.120
But no, we have this guild on there and we're currently raiding Karazhan because we finally

41:44.120 --> 41:47.860
have enough people who are level 70 to start doing some of the 10-man raids.

41:47.860 --> 41:53.000
And I'll tell you what, when we finally get the strategy down to beat one of the bosses

41:53.000 --> 41:57.600
such as Maiden of Virtue was one of those bosses where the first couple times we went

41:57.600 --> 42:00.000
in there and did it, oh my God, she was so tough.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.560
But then when we were finally able to overcome that and beat her, we were so happy and so

42:03.560 --> 42:06.620
excited because we really accomplished something.

42:06.620 --> 42:09.160
Not like, oh my gosh, I'm going to run out naked through the streets.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.160
I'm so happy.

42:10.160 --> 42:14.000
But there definitely is that emotion of, hey, look, we accomplished this together.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
That's pretty rad.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.380
Yeah, I guess.

42:20.380 --> 42:21.380
I don't know.

42:21.380 --> 42:27.560
It's a different type of answer, you know, not necessarily a scripted thing, but working

42:27.560 --> 42:28.920
together towards a common goal.

42:28.920 --> 42:33.840
I still laughed my ass off in Final Fantasy VII, by the way.

42:33.840 --> 42:34.840
Do you?

42:34.840 --> 42:35.840
I laughed.

42:35.840 --> 42:36.840
Nice.

42:36.840 --> 42:41.200
To continue with the email, personally, mine are the bridge battle in Shining Force, escaping

42:41.200 --> 42:46.820
Midgar in Final Fantasy VII, and the aforementioned wall at the end of the world in Grandia.

42:46.820 --> 42:50.880
The Shining Force thing probably doesn't seem all that interesting to most people, but that

42:50.880 --> 42:57.360
was my first RPG at age 6 in 1993, oh, I feel old, so it's got a special place in my heart.

42:57.360 --> 43:01.400
Speaking of sentimental games, it'd also be cool to know what games are particularly special

43:01.400 --> 43:02.780
to you, and why.

43:02.780 --> 43:05.480
Keep up the great show, Mr. D.

43:05.480 --> 43:13.240
As far as games that are special to me, Super Street Fighter II on Super Nintendo, because

43:13.240 --> 43:19.200
it was my very first Super Nintendo game that I, that was mine, and not my brother's, on

43:19.200 --> 43:28.000
my Nintendo system, mine, me, it belonged to me, Kirby's Avalanche.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.400
Special games, um, I don't know, I can't think of a whole lot that, like, Super Metroid I

43:34.400 --> 43:37.560
suppose would be one, just that, you know, just because I think it's like the really

43:37.560 --> 43:40.920
the greatest game ever.

43:40.920 --> 43:45.020
I would have to, maybe I would go all the way back to like the Atari 2600 and say things

43:45.020 --> 43:48.380
like Spider-Man, because those are some of my earliest gaming memories right there, so

43:48.380 --> 43:49.960
those games are definitely special.

43:49.960 --> 43:55.840
I have, you know, and I, sorry, this really makes me feel old, but I remember being, you

43:55.840 --> 44:03.020
know, little, like a first grader, and going next door to my friend's house and playing

44:03.020 --> 44:11.520
their Odyssey 2, and playing, um, I want to say it was like a Lord of the Rings game or

44:11.520 --> 44:16.320
something, no it wasn't, it was, um, you play either as a fighter, a wizard, a changeling,

44:16.320 --> 44:21.320
or something else, and, you know, and playing, what was that, um, Casey Munchkin's Crazy

44:21.320 --> 44:27.560
Chase that got sued for being like Pac-Man, which I actually still have a copy of it,

44:27.560 --> 44:34.320
you know, I guess, you know, I kind of have, you know, good memories of that, but I also

44:34.320 --> 44:39.840
have good memories of playing Kix in elementary school.

44:39.840 --> 44:44.400
I'll tell you what game I used to freaking love that's very special to me, it's an old

44:44.400 --> 44:48.880
ass computer game called Rogue, I don't know if you've ever played this game, but you control

44:48.880 --> 44:52.120
a little happy face looking thing, it was all done in ASCII graphics, but it was an

44:52.120 --> 44:56.080
actual game, I think like Epyx or somebody put it out, but you play this little, um,

44:56.080 --> 45:00.000
ASCII happy face that went around and, uh, through these tunnels and you were exploring,

45:00.000 --> 45:05.160
you know, like a dungeon, and creatures were giant capital letters that would, like a B

45:05.160 --> 45:07.520
for bat would attack you and all this stuff, so.

45:07.520 --> 45:13.440
Sounds like quite a number of the old, um, it was old school, but great.

45:13.440 --> 45:21.160
Well also, um, I have to say, when I was in second or third grade, we had a Clicca Vision,

45:21.160 --> 45:26.800
and for me it was always playing Venture and Mouse Trap, which I suck at Venture now, but

45:26.800 --> 45:30.880
you know, I guess, I guess it's like really a lot, because there's certain games that

45:30.880 --> 45:33.720
I would be playing at a time that I'd attach to certain things that were going on in my

45:33.720 --> 45:40.920
life at the time, and like, I think it's entirely hilarious, Dan was trying to, um, uh, I guess

45:40.920 --> 45:46.700
catalog things that had happened in his life, and, um, he was doing a lot of it by sort

45:46.700 --> 45:51.680
of what he was playing at that time and what grade he was in, and I thought that, you know,

45:51.680 --> 45:55.080
honestly, that's sort of how I correlate a lot of stuff that happens to me too, because

45:55.080 --> 45:59.520
I'll remember, oh, this happened, and at the time I was playing this, so I have that kind

45:59.520 --> 46:03.520
of memory attachment, I guess.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.520
Alright.

46:04.520 --> 46:08.360
Loki, you're awfully quiet, not a lot of special video games for you?

46:08.360 --> 46:09.360
He's looking at porn.

46:09.360 --> 46:10.360
No special games?

46:10.360 --> 46:12.040
Yeah, I'm looking at news.

46:12.040 --> 46:14.480
Gals Panic is not a special game to you?

46:14.480 --> 46:16.480
It was fun.

46:16.480 --> 46:17.480
Alright.

46:17.480 --> 46:19.480
No more emails?

46:19.480 --> 46:20.480
No.

46:20.480 --> 46:21.480
That's it?

46:21.480 --> 46:22.480
Alright.

46:22.480 --> 46:26.560
Oh, oh, oh, we have one particular attachment, remember, our names are attached to.

46:26.560 --> 46:27.560
Hm?

46:27.560 --> 46:28.560
OLR the game.

46:28.560 --> 46:29.560
Oh, yeah.

46:29.560 --> 46:30.560
The text game.

46:30.560 --> 46:31.560
Oh, yes, of course.

46:31.560 --> 46:32.560
The OLR text game.

46:32.560 --> 46:36.000
Put that on our wiki, people.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Where is it?

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Can you still get a copy of that?

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
It's got to be available somewhere.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
I think I've got it somewhere.

46:40.000 --> 46:46.000
Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, but we're going

46:46.000 --> 46:50.040
to get to the Skype line very soon, we have some gaming news first.

46:50.040 --> 46:52.540
Yes.

46:52.540 --> 46:59.000
So there was a rumor going around that Def Leppard was going to be in Guitar Hero 4,

46:59.000 --> 47:03.680
and actually it ended up turning out that wasn't exactly true.

47:03.680 --> 47:08.960
It was during an interview with a band on the radio show Rockline, and I guess a caller

47:08.960 --> 47:13.360
asked why none of their songs had been featured in Guitar Hero or Rockman, and of course their

47:13.360 --> 47:18.960
guitarist Phil Cullen replied, revealing at least three of their hits would be featured

47:18.960 --> 47:20.680
in Guitar Hero 4.

47:20.680 --> 47:24.640
Rock of Ages, Animal, and of course, Photograph.

47:24.640 --> 47:28.740
The problem is though, it actually isn't going to be featured in Guitar Hero 4, he

47:28.740 --> 47:32.920
was wrong, it's actually download content that's going to be coming out soon for Guitar

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
Hero 3.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
Oh, nice.

47:34.920 --> 47:40.720
So, there will be Def Leppard songs, just not in Guitar Hero 4, at least not those songs.

47:40.720 --> 47:44.720
There will be Def Leppard.

47:44.720 --> 47:45.720
That's going to be fun.

47:45.720 --> 47:50.100
Well, you know, I was thinking, we just had a story a couple weeks ago that really made

47:50.100 --> 47:54.000
us think that arcades were dying, I mean we kind of already kind of knew that sadly arcades

47:54.000 --> 47:58.160
are dying and they're just not what they used to be, and you know, I think we had another

47:58.160 --> 48:01.680
story about, didn't we have the story last week about Namco's doing something with the

48:01.680 --> 48:04.520
Wii in their arcades, or somebody trying to like integrate all that stuff?

48:04.520 --> 48:05.920
Yeah, we talked about it last week.

48:05.920 --> 48:10.720
Well, here's, I guess somebody else has faith in arcade games because apparently, Signature

48:10.720 --> 48:15.320
Devices, they're hardware and software developers, they have sent word out that they are putting

48:15.320 --> 48:21.820
final touches on a new four player arcade game that will quote, include several well

48:21.820 --> 48:25.380
known comic book and television superheroes.

48:25.380 --> 48:30.160
As to who those are, that's still a mystery, could be anything, I mean it could literally

48:30.160 --> 48:35.120
be anything from the Marvel DC world all the way to heroes from NBC, although I kind of

48:35.120 --> 48:42.100
doubt that, but I guess it's kind of interesting that all hope is not dead yet for arcades

48:42.100 --> 48:46.000
and depending on what names are attached to this game, because you know, well known quote

48:46.000 --> 48:49.800
unquote, you know, that could be Dora the Explorer as a hero to some, and I don't know

48:49.800 --> 48:54.720
if that's going to be the one that gets people to come back, so hopefully it's the right

48:54.720 --> 48:55.720
thing.

48:55.720 --> 49:00.240
We'll have more information on that in the coming weeks.

49:00.240 --> 49:03.400
Well, how about some other news then?

49:03.400 --> 49:04.400
Alrighty.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.400
Capcom!

49:05.400 --> 49:07.400
As in Capcom's gamer's day.

49:07.400 --> 49:13.480
Well, they're letting, like, people who are not the press go, except they're only letting

49:13.480 --> 49:20.160
five of them go, so basically five lucky people are going to be able to get in and they're

49:20.160 --> 49:29.520
actually calling it Captivate08, which is, I guess, kind of an interesting name, but

49:29.520 --> 49:37.720
if you're lucky, you get to get in and play with everybody else, but basically I don't

49:37.720 --> 49:40.480
really see, though, anything on here about how it actually is accomplished.

49:40.480 --> 49:45.280
I think you have to write them, basically there's a little thingy, email them saying

49:45.280 --> 49:50.480
why you think you should be able to go, and then they pick a winner out of that.

49:50.480 --> 49:56.480
There's actually a link on there afterwards, but you basically said it, so there you go.

49:56.480 --> 49:57.480
Beg!

49:57.480 --> 49:58.480
That still sucks, though.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.040
Get one and sell it on eBay.

50:00.040 --> 50:01.880
Well, you should enter the contest.

50:01.880 --> 50:05.560
Don't tell them you do this show, just tell them, you know, oh, I grew up on Mega Man

50:05.560 --> 50:09.520
and I love Capcom and Street Fighter is so memorable to me, buh buh buh, write something

50:09.520 --> 50:11.520
really cheesy and maybe they'll pick you.

50:11.520 --> 50:13.520
They get to go anyway.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.600
That's not a cool lie to them like that.

50:15.600 --> 50:16.600
It's not lying.

50:16.600 --> 50:20.720
No, you've got to say that you're part of an independent podcast and that they don't

50:20.720 --> 50:25.240
give the little guy a fair shake, and then you make them feel bad.

50:25.240 --> 50:30.000
And then they don't care, and then you say, well, fuck, your Mega Man games lately have

50:30.000 --> 50:31.540
sucked so what do I care?

50:31.540 --> 50:37.400
Let's say you enter it and then you lose because they say, oh, well, you know, you're a podcaster,

50:37.400 --> 50:41.520
you know, then that's a double standard because then they're saying, oh, but podcasters and

50:41.520 --> 50:44.760
people like that aren't supposed to come to this, so make up your mind.

50:44.760 --> 50:48.280
It doesn't make any sense though, podcasters and people in the media aren't supposed to

50:48.280 --> 50:49.280
come to their media event?

50:49.280 --> 50:50.280
Oh, that sucks.

50:50.280 --> 50:54.520
Oh, I'm sorry, we're not, you know, IGN or anything, so that's fine.

50:54.520 --> 50:55.520
Whatever.

50:55.520 --> 51:01.760
I don't want to play Mega Man, was it, Star Force, Zerker, X, you know, Sauron or Ninja

51:01.760 --> 51:02.760
or whatever.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.520
It'll all be on YouTube the day after anyway.

51:04.520 --> 51:07.360
I really don't care.

51:07.360 --> 51:08.760
I'm just bitter like that.

51:08.760 --> 51:09.760
Well, I don't know.

51:09.760 --> 51:12.400
The gamer day events we have gone to in the past have been kind of fun.

51:12.400 --> 51:13.400
Yeah, all two of them.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.440
It is kind of thrilling to be there, you know.

51:15.440 --> 51:20.880
Yeah, Konami was the only ones that invited us and then they moved away, so.

51:20.880 --> 51:21.880
Oh, bye-bye.

51:21.880 --> 51:22.880
Bye-bye.

51:22.880 --> 51:23.880
Okay.

51:23.880 --> 51:28.920
Anyways, there's a game out there, this is free to play too, you don't have to go to

51:28.920 --> 51:31.560
some stupid gamer's day to play it.

51:31.560 --> 51:34.560
It's a game called Tetroid 2012.

51:34.560 --> 51:41.200
It's a mash-up of Tetris and Arkanoid and actually I think a little bit like Silent

51:41.200 --> 51:44.320
Hills, especially if you listen to some of the soundtrack for it.

51:44.320 --> 51:47.140
It's really trippy, but it's free to download.

51:47.140 --> 51:52.920
It's actually available on, let's see here, come over to the website.

51:52.920 --> 51:55.960
It's a hundred and eleven meg download too, if I remember it correctly.

51:55.960 --> 52:01.760
Lots of music and sound effects in there, but the website, to go check it out, it's

52:01.760 --> 52:08.600
entity dot B E slash entity and then there's some links to the games that they make.

52:08.600 --> 52:14.000
They made a, of course, this game and then I guess a remake of Tempest.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.480
So if you're a fan of Tempest, you can check that out as well.

52:16.480 --> 52:17.480
I heart Tempest.

52:17.480 --> 52:18.480
I might have to check that.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.960
Does it go super zap or recharge?

52:19.960 --> 52:22.680
I don't know, but it's very trippy looking.

52:22.680 --> 52:26.920
Before this though, from what I remember, I guess that they used to do like demo scene

52:26.920 --> 52:32.120
stuff, you know, all the like encoding graphic little demos and stuff like that.

52:32.120 --> 52:35.000
But it is a very trippy looking game.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.280
I was looking at that Tetroid 2012 a little bit ago and it definitely looks interesting.

52:40.280 --> 52:44.240
Because you charge up with like a little special meter and then when you hit the special button,

52:44.240 --> 52:48.760
it flips the whole screen upside down and then you turn into like, you know, Arkanoid

52:48.760 --> 52:49.760
mode or whatever.

52:49.760 --> 52:52.480
I have to admit, that's kind of neat.

52:52.480 --> 52:57.680
So hopefully we'll check that out a little later, at least maybe I'll download that and

52:57.680 --> 52:59.160
check it out.

52:59.160 --> 53:03.400
Another kind of indie thing that's come out and some folks mentioned this earlier in the

53:03.400 --> 53:06.800
program, Rom Check Fail.

53:06.800 --> 53:12.400
Rom Check Fail is like this mishmash of all of these like old school NES games.

53:12.400 --> 53:18.720
It's got Legend of Zelda, Pac-Man, Mario Brothers, Spy Hunter, Kix, all this stuff in there.

53:18.720 --> 53:22.840
But the interesting thing about it, it doesn't exactly play like these games.

53:22.840 --> 53:28.340
Like for instance, you might be Link and you're in the Super Mario Brothers world and you're

53:28.340 --> 53:34.320
trying to stab at asteroids and then all of a sudden you're Pac-Man and you're in Arkanoid.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.600
It randomly changes your characters too.

53:36.600 --> 53:41.720
So sometimes you will have like the really crappy, what was it, Space Invaders, you know,

53:41.720 --> 53:46.560
ship and stuff like that or, you know, some of them can only, you know, shoot in one direction.

53:46.560 --> 53:50.920
And you have to basically play them like, you know, their respective games.

53:50.920 --> 53:53.440
It's a very interesting game.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.400
You can check it out if you want to.

53:55.400 --> 54:01.460
Indiegames.com, I-N-D-I-E-G-A-M-E-S.com actually had, oh I'm sorry, they're actually the ones

54:01.460 --> 54:09.760
that I guess originally highlighted this and link directly to farbs.org that has the game,

54:09.760 --> 54:14.200
F-A-R-B-S.O-R-G slash games dot HTML.

54:14.200 --> 54:18.880
And they make some other games too like Polychromatic Funk Monkey.

54:18.880 --> 54:22.220
That's the best name ever, Funk Monkey.

54:22.220 --> 54:24.840
Is that what you're gonna name your band now, Polychromatic Funk Monkey?

54:24.840 --> 54:25.840
Sure, why not.

54:25.840 --> 54:27.100
All right, there you got it.

54:27.100 --> 54:28.360
Let's see, what's the definition here.

54:28.360 --> 54:31.760
As anyone who's built maps for tile-based platforming games would tell you, building

54:31.760 --> 54:34.600
maps for tile-based platforming games is fun.

54:34.600 --> 54:38.980
That's why I made Polychromatic Funk Monkey a tile-based platforming game about building

54:38.980 --> 54:44.860
maps for tile-based platforming games. In Polychromatic Funk Monkey, the eponymous

54:44.860 --> 54:49.500
monkey of funk brings order and rhythm to his chaotic land, arranging the blocks

54:49.500 --> 54:54.900
he finds into towering staircases and bridges in the sky. Sounds like a riot.

54:54.900 --> 55:00.380
And then there's another game called Fishy Fishy. I think this might be one of

55:00.380 --> 55:07.060
my new favorite developers. That's beautiful. You can get them on the show.

55:07.060 --> 55:13.460
I will send an email this week and see what we can do. Okay. But he'll have to

55:13.460 --> 55:18.060
wait because I'm not doing anything special for Life 365, so maybe we can

55:18.060 --> 55:21.900
have him on our Debut All Games episode. I have to say that I watched someone play

55:21.900 --> 55:27.260
through a whole game of Romcheck Fail. I was cracking up the entire

55:27.260 --> 55:34.660
time. Romcheck win! I know, win for reals. So guess what? What? We have more news.

55:34.660 --> 55:42.180
Okay. Paramount is going to be getting into games. They are going to be

55:42.180 --> 55:50.380
doing a mobile handheld casual games because they make money and a lot of

55:50.380 --> 55:54.300
them are talking about tie-ins between their movie franchises and these games.

55:54.300 --> 56:01.260
So hey, that'd be cool. Here's the other thing I bet happened. Paramount realized

56:01.260 --> 56:06.500
rider's strike, loss of money, people aren't going to the movies like they

56:06.500 --> 56:13.220
used to, video games, money machine. What would you do? They also may have realized

56:13.220 --> 56:21.620
hey, Sony, Warner, Vivendi, they're all in games as well. Vivendi? Vivendi. You said

56:21.620 --> 56:32.100
Vinvidi. Whatever. Fusion of Vivendi and Nvidia. Vivendi, whatever. Oh, and Disney or

56:32.100 --> 56:42.260
Buena Vista. They're all in games, so why not them? Hooray! One game that they're

56:42.260 --> 56:46.740
not making but you can get for dirt cheap, at least this weekend, Steam has

56:46.740 --> 56:52.620
been offering Prey for $4.95 this weekend only. So apparently if you listen to this on

56:52.620 --> 56:57.540
podcasts you've missed out, unless you bought this already. But get it now

56:57.540 --> 57:02.820
because you only have a few hours left before this deal is up. And Prey, for

57:02.820 --> 57:08.260
those who may not remember, was a 3D Realms game, not Duke Nukem Forever, and

57:08.260 --> 57:14.940
involved you, a Native American, to be basically abducted onto a ship where

57:14.940 --> 57:20.940
there's a bunch of weird, crazy shit and you can never die. We can die in the very

57:20.940 --> 57:24.500
early levels if you're not good at first-person shooters. I died once in the

57:24.500 --> 57:27.420
early levels because I'm horrible at first-person shooters. I played it on the

57:27.420 --> 57:31.220
Xbox 360. It's not bad and it has beautiful soundtrack. It has an absolutely

57:31.220 --> 57:34.820
gorgeous soundtrack. It's from the guy who did Oblivion and Guild Wars and all

57:34.820 --> 57:39.980
that, so you know the music's good. The game itself, kind of a little short. Like, I

57:39.980 --> 57:44.020
remember it kind of just ended suddenly, but definitely made way for a sequel.

57:44.020 --> 57:49.420
So, all right. Five bucks, though. That's not too bad of a deal for a game like that,

57:49.420 --> 57:53.260
especially on PC. Maybe I'll actually get that. What the hell? I'm on a

57:53.260 --> 57:57.740
shopping spree this weekend on Steam. I only have a couple hours left?

57:57.740 --> 58:01.900
All right, get out of my house, people. I gotta download Prey. All right, if you

58:01.900 --> 58:05.820
would like to give us a call and chat with us, join us on the Skype line. It's

58:05.820 --> 58:12.580
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. The Skype line is

58:12.580 --> 58:17.900
now open, so give us a call. We're already getting a call.

58:17.900 --> 58:25.380
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

58:25.380 --> 58:30.860
Who's this? Yeah, you're just a little quiet, but maybe that's our studio mic.

58:30.860 --> 58:38.860
What's on your mind, Zaku? Nothing. Mine's just trying to go through, you

58:38.860 --> 58:44.300
know, it kind of sucks that you have to ditch Live 365. Well, it kind of sucks

58:44.300 --> 58:47.140
they had to double their rates. Hold on, you are really quiet. Can you get closer

58:47.140 --> 58:50.020
to your microphone? It's not just us. You're coming through really quiet on the

58:50.020 --> 58:57.020
thing. Okay, much better. This better. Much better. All right, what's on

58:57.020 --> 59:02.140
your mind? So it sucks we have to leave Live 365. Let me see, I was gonna get

59:02.140 --> 59:08.380
Rainbow Six Vegas, but from what I read, Ubisoft's not doing their job

59:08.380 --> 59:13.700
and trying to get away the shit out of it. You know, all the bugs on the PS3 and

59:13.700 --> 59:18.980
360 that are making me jittery and just making me nervous right now before, you

59:18.980 --> 59:25.860
know, or even buy the damn thing. You said it was Rainbow Six Vegas 2? 2, yeah.

59:25.860 --> 59:29.980
2. Have you played Rainbow Six Vegas 2? I don't like Tom Clancy games. No, I have

59:29.980 --> 59:33.180
some folks on my Xbox Live list though that have been playing nothing but that

59:33.180 --> 59:39.700
lately. Yeah, they're lucky enough through the crap that, you know, the current bugs that

59:39.700 --> 59:46.780
haven't been fixed yet. Did you actually buy the game or are you just

59:46.780 --> 59:51.700
worried about it? Not yet. I just read it on Kotaku, that's the thing. I just read,

59:51.700 --> 59:54.780
you know, I read it from other folks that the PS3 version of the servers were

59:54.780 --> 59:59.300
like, you know, we're basically, we're going, we're just getting really flaky

59:59.300 --> 01:00:04.460
and just not connecting through games. 360 version was about the same with very

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.660
noticeable glitches and whatnot. So I kind of like, you know, I'm waiting right

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:13.260
now so I'm getting paid tomorrow. Hopefully if they fix the, if there's a patch

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:17.900
coming out very soon, that's all I need for me to actually go down to game

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:24.260
shop and buy the game. Well, is there anybody in chat at our chat room?

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:29.740
chat.orangelandtrader.com that maybe has some suggestions on this

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.660
game? Like, is it worth the, worth buying it now or should he wait for a patch or

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.940
what? Because, yeah, Loki doesn't play those games. I don't think Jamie's played

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:40.420
it and I have not played it so I'm kind of curious if anyone in our chat has

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:45.860
anything to say about it. We'll see. It's part of the beauty of doing this live

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.540
with the chat room. When we are not familiar with it, hopefully somebody

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:52.740
else is. Well, what else is on your mind, Zaku, while we wait for some comments?

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:56.580
Well, I know, I know I don't like to bring up, you know, Bimani that much, but EMUs?

01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:02.260
Mm-hmm. By now you've probably heard it's already rolling out on, on some, on

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:06.460
somewhat of a national level, although it's in one arcade. Yeah, we covered the

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:11.020
one arcade a couple weeks ago. Has it rolled out to more yet? Still, I mean, no

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:17.180
unlocks so far, so I'm not sure whether, you know, at this rate if we're, if we're

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.340
trying to catch up to Japan in terms of unlocking the game, so at the time they're

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:27.460
done, we'll be done in like, what, October, November at that rate? Well, they've only

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:31.700
got one arcade working on it. Hey, we got a response, we got a response about Vegas

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:36.460
2. Ross2UT says, well, I got my version of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 exchange for the

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:41.140
360 and it's fine aside from the odd frame rate drop, which never becomes

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:45.940
unplayable. Online co-op is absolutely amazing, especially as you actually go

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:51.020
through the story this time. There you have it. Sounds like a fairly

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:56.580
favorable review. Yeah. Alright, Zaku, anything else before we let you go and

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:02.300
take some more calls? Any plans on finding a good replacement for Live 365

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:08.100
that won't involve, you know, cleaning royalties up the ass? Yes, listen to Part A, we are going to be

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:12.740
merging with AllGames.com and doing our show live on their feed and we, you

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:17.860
won't have to register any of that stuff anymore, it's gonna be great. So, so in

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:22.100
terms of the radio station, that's done for, you know, that's done for good, right? As far as

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:27.740
the 24-hour, seven-week, or 24-hour day, seven-day week feed, yes, it's, we're not

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.980
gonna be operating it on Live 365 anymore. Instead, we're gonna be

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:34.220
trying to come together with other independent podcasters to create a

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:39.380
Voltron network. Oh, really now? Oh, really. Will you still be able to play the music

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:43.780
eventually? Mm-hmm. Nothing is changing on our show, everything is staying the same.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:50.260
Right, of course, I, you know, I just, you know, just wanted to be kept in the loop, just

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:55.700
like everyone else. I just got in right now, just playing like, playing my 360 up until

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:59.300
like an hour ago. Alright, well check out Part A, check out Part A when it goes up

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.620
later tonight, it has all the details, alrighty? Alright. Alright, take care,

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:08.260
buddy. Have a good one. Alright, if you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:13.140
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, let's take another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio,

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:20.300
who's this? GS68. Hello, GS68, what is on your mind? I've been, okay, I've been

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:24.500
reading the comments for this one story and think about how PC's, PC gaming is

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.940
dying, and like, there's a lot of like, comments saying about how PC gaming is

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:35.260
not dead, and how like, PC gaming is superior to consoles and crap, I mean, they

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:39.900
got me wondering, I mean, aside from the games, what do consoles have on PCs? I

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:45.740
mean, and then like, there's some people talking about how like, keyboard and mouse

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:49.820
like, goes great with like, how like, there should be keyboard and mouse support for

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:56.700
every PS3 game, among other things. Um, I don't know, I, I don't think there's a lot

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.640
of truth to that whole PC gaming is dying, I think it's that when a game

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.860
comes out on the PC and the console, the console tends to do a little better, but

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:09.340
come on, look at a game, but look at a game like World of Warcraft, that's huge,

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:13.020
you know what, millions of, that's only on the PC, you're not gonna, I'm not exactly

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:18.820
talking about like, PC games dying, I'm just talking about like, I mean, a lot of

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:26.100
people saying how PC gaming is superior to console gaming, and how PC can like, do

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:32.020
everything from like, for your homework or browsing the internet, and, and you

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:37.380
don't have to buy like, $500 consoles like, every few years, just upgraded PCs, I

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:42.380
mean, with that said, I mean, what do consoles have on PCs, I mean, besides the

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:48.160
games on them? I think consoles also have a lot of convenience for them, keep in

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.060
mind, again, and I think I've used this argument earlier in the show, but keep in

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:55.060
mind that the gaming hardcore, the gaming hobbyists, the people that are likely to

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:59.900
listen to this show and all that, you know, you're included in this, the way we

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:04.860
play games and all that is not the same as necessarily everybody who buys them,

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.860
there's a large amount of people who want to just pop a cartridge in a system

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:12.820
and go, and the fact that it hook up, hooks up to the TV, so you don't have to

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.740
buy all this other stuff, I mean, I think that's kind of how console gaming sort of

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:19.540
took off in the first place, is that it hooked up to your TV, you didn't have to

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.380
buy any type of separate monitor, you didn't have to buy, you know, separate

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:28.380
stuff, I would say, I would argue, those that remember when the Commodore 64 was

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:32.180
out in this country, and you know, it did very well in Europe as well, that's one

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:35.900
reason the Commodore 64 did so great, is because not only did the Commodore 64

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:40.020
have a monitor it would hook up to, but it also would hook up to your TV, and

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.340
that was a pretty big deal, to have a home computer that actually was on your

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.780
TV as well, so I think there really is just that convenience of having it in

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:53.820
your living room. I mean, even games that normally do on consoles, like 2D

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:59.460
platformers and scrolling shooters, I mean, there are, I mean, there are like

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:04.980
free games at that store that you can download on the PC, I mean, like, look at

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:10.820
Cave Story and Disreducted, so yeah, Llamalana, I mean, those are great

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:16.500
platforms, but they're not on consoles, I mean, they're for the PC, and they're

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:23.500
free, I mean, there's, I mean, I can't name any free console games, or free indie

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:29.020
console games. I'll give you one, and I hate to say it, but Yaris, but, well, there

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:34.860
was also Age's Wing, and, you know, a few of those, a very, very few handful

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:39.300
available on Xbox Live. I would like to see more, I would like to see a

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:43.600
subscription-based available service, or, you know, some more free perks on the

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.300
consoles here and there, but there isn't a lot of money to be made in free,

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:52.060
unfortunately, and with those consoles, to buy a development kit for those

01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:59.300
consoles costs thousands and thousands of dollars, so unless they are specifically

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:05.260
reaching out to the indie crowd, such as XNA does, it's very difficult to procure

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:11.260
one of those systems and make games for it, whereas with a PC, well, it's very

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.820
easy, I mean, in comparison to just, you know, fire up a coding program, and a

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.680
C++ compiler, or whatever language you want to program in, and make your game, you

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:25.220
know what I mean? So, I think that's kind of the difference is that it's more

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:29.100
accessible to make stuff indie-wise on the PC than it is for consoles who have

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:36.140
a very closed authoring format. So, all right, well, GS68, do you have anything

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:40.100
else you want to share or ask us tonight? I have, but I have Tip of the Tongue

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:46.220
Syndrome right now. Oh, that's all right. Well, thank you very much for calling, and

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:50.460
I'm sure we'll hear from you again. It won't be the last time, right? No. All

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:56.420
right, well, take care, buddy. Have a good one. All right, if you want to give us a

01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:01.820
call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. You're

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:05.940
wearing the ferret on your head, DarkSakura? I love the ferret. I know you do.

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.940
Too bad it's not on camera. All right, yeah, too bad it's not on the camera. All right,

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:13.180
my ferret headgear. Can I wear the ferret on my head for a little bit on the cam? I

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:17.100
don't even know if Justin.TV is working right now. I've been very terrible at

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:21.460
checking that chat tonight. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, it's

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:26.180
DJ Ramba S from Anime Jam Sessions. Well, hello, DJ Ramba S from Anime Jam

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:31.340
Sessions. What's up? Not much, and that was me that told you that we were doing a

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:36.020
live feed of OLR from Anime Boston. Did it happen? Did it actually happen?

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:40.020
Partially. When we got there, we started setting up, I started to feed, and I'm

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:46.220
like, okay, where's the power? Where's the power? I see other dealers, other vendors

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:53.740
with power. I'm like, okay. I go over to the convention head, center head to get

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:58.980
power, and it's like 119 for the full weekend, so we're like... This is a long no

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:04.980
answer, isn't it? So I was like, no. So we ended up having the feed a little bit on

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.580
Friday and for about a couple of hours on Sunday. Did you, were you here for the

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:13.980
announcement? Because that was a heck of a show to be listening to. No, I was

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:18.580
having a WrestleMania 24 party, but I did hear the announcement about

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:23.580
where OLR is heading off to. Okay, cool. I was just like, yeah, that was, last week

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.380
was an interesting week, but we didn't know ourselves until about 45 minutes

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:31.020
before we went on air, just what was about to happen, so anyway. Well, because the

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.340
thing is, I actually know somebody that probably would have kept you guys going

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:40.460
for 24-7. It's, you know, it's okay. We got a lot of great offers along those

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:46.660
types of lines, but we're excited about the powers of Voltron, so we'll see

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.900
what happens. I think it's gonna be exciting. Well, what else is on your mind,

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:55.660
Rama? Not too much of one. The basic give you guys a basic con rap of anime Boston,

01:09:55.660 --> 01:10:00.020
and believe it or not, you want to know what most popular items in the dealer's

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:04.880
room was? Final Fantasy 7 related material. Nope.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.780
Yowie. There's always the number two item sold at dealer's rooms.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:18.420
Dolphies. No. I bet there were some, though. I did see a couple. All right, what? I give up.

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:24.460
Nintendo merchandise. Almost every single vendor had all kinds of Super

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.800
Mario Brothers or standard Nintendo merchandise that was selling like hot

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:33.180
cakes. Oh yeah, was WYSIWYG there? Yes, they were. They are the big culprits for

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:39.660
the Nintendo goods, plus they sell Pocky. Well, they weren't selling Pocky

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:43.980
at this condo. Sad! They can't, because when your

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:47.660
convention is in a convention center, according to the contract, you're not allowed to sell

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:53.420
food. Well, that sucks, because I bought every burger at Fauna Mae last year. Is that the

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:58.380
candy hamburger stuff? Yes, the candy hamburger. I love that stuff. That stuff is really good. Well, that stuff is fine, but you

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:02.220
can't sell like Pocky or Ramenade and stuff like that. That you

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:09.440
can't sell. Lame. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. It's kind of crazy, though, but me and my

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.620
crew, we're trying to figure out like a way around that. Well, good luck to you.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:19.460
How was the con otherwise? Good times? It was great. The number one problem

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:27.500
was the long, long, long, long. Did I mention long lines for registration? Oh, of course.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:31.540
That seems to be the problem with a lot of anime cons, is long registration lines. Yeah,

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.980
but at most cons, it's like you wait no more than an hour to get your badge. There were

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:40.580
people that were waiting anywhere between five and eleven hours for their badges. Eleven

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:47.220
hours to get a badge? You've got to be fucking kidding me. Yes, I'm not kidding. Nope. That's

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:51.700
crazy talk. Yeah, they print them out on these machines and the machines broke. There's only

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:59.100
four people on registration and the lines were going forever. Um, someone posted a link.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:06.460
They did a parody of Still Alive to Still In Line. Nice. I think, and I've been suggesting

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:13.340
this for a while now, for conventions, they should take the old E3 approach and mail your

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:19.140
pass. Yeah, there are some conventions that do that, but the problem is dealing with the

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.460
mail and individual postage and the stamping and stuff. At most conventions, the easiest

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:28.060
thing to do is just do the normal pre-reg. You show up with proof that it's yours. They

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.420
print out the label, slap it on your badge, run it through the laminator, and send you

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:39.580
off. Or just don't make fancy fucking badges. Maybe people need to cut back on the badges

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:48.020
a little bit. But it's really not that hard to mass produce the badges like that. I honestly

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:53.140
think that there can be some sort of, and this is actually even a way for them to make

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:58.420
the money for shipping because all you have to do is mail them out by whatever bulk rate

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:04.340
I guess would be available for business, but have them printed out and you pay like X amount

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:11.660
extra to have your badge mailed to you. I know that's a good thing. I actually know

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:16.700
a couple of people that are like reg department heads that worked reg, and they say it just

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:21.780
doesn't work that way. It wouldn't work out. It wouldn't be all that cost effective. That's

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:26.820
how it is. Hence the paying a little extra. Yeah. I mean, that was the only method. If

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:33.460
someone wants to avoid the long line, then just say, well, I will pay another five dollars

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:37.740
for postage and you can mail it to me. Well, what some cons are doing now, they're offering

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:44.020
like two year badges, three year badges, lifetime badges, and pre-con night. The thing is, not

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:48.180
everybody's going to come up Thursday night for convention. So to give that option, and

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:52.260
a lot of people still do it, but the difference is you show up Thursday, you get your badge

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:58.900
under 15 minutes tops. AX did the day before thing, and it was just as much of a pardon

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:05.540
in the expression clusterfuck as it is doing day of. Interesting. All right. So if you're

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:10.340
not there by 10 a.m., you're basically SOL. Well, we had to wrap up, Rama. Definitely

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:13.100
some lessons learned for anybody thinking about throwing it on at a convention in the

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:18.720
near future, but any last minute thoughts for our folks? Three links I posted in a chat

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:25.140
room took pictures from my website. One picture is a cart, a facial looking like World 1-1

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:29.060
from Super Mario Brothers, and the last two pictures is the old man from The Legend of

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:37.220
Zelda. The first one says, it's dangerous to go alone, take this, and the second one

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:46.220
says, Dodongo dislikes smoke. I figured you'd get a kick out of that. Sorry, I'm looking

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:51.620
at the picture. That's great. I know this is horrible radio, but there actually is somebody

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:55.340
dressed up holding a big old poster board that says, it's dangerous to go alone, take

01:14:55.340 --> 01:15:03.140
this. But where's the sword? Hello? Or the cannon? If you go to djvaughness.net and click

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:07.300
on gallery, you'll see all the pictures from anime boss in the OA. It's like 320 shots

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:11.540
I took. All right. Sounds like fun. All right, Rama, we got to let you go. Take more calls.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:16.220
All right. Take care, guys. All right. One more call, and we're going to call it a night.

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:23.100
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. And while we wait for a call, Loki, any quick

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:29.780
last minute stories? Yeah, I've been gathering stories this entire time. Oh, we got one more.

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:38.020
I love cutting you off. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? The ferret's going to go. But

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:42.940
we don't want the ferret to go, Bobby. I don't think people can handle hearing the ferret

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:51.820
in a 96K stereo. I should make an audio out for that ferret. You know what? Just think

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:58.380
of it this way, though, DarkSakura. Viking funeral for the ferret. I'll take the ferret

01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:04.380
home with me. No, I don't think Bobby's serious about the ferret, are you, Bobby? No, I'm

01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:09.380
not. I know you're not. What's on your mind, Bobby? Nothing much. I've been hanging out

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:13.380
in the chat room trying to calm everybody's fears. Yeah, about like, OMG, we're going

01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:17.620
to have to suddenly change everything we're doing. And I'm kind of like, have you ever

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:23.760
listened to the other shows on AllGames.com? Yeah, don't worry about it. What would we

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:30.060
have to change? Other than maybe I'll have to bring on a soundboard. No, I'm just kidding.

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:35.140
And you'll have to get rid of the ferret. And the ferret. And we're going to put a big

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:39.860
picture on our, big thing on our site, you know, saying, hey, you know, Orange Tons Radio

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:43.340
is coming in, we're going to get like Tingle, and we're going to Photoshop Loki's head on

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:48.700
it and that's going to be your new logo. It's going to be awesome. Nice. Can't wait. See,

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:52.100
these are all the type of editorial decisions that are being made for us now. That's the

01:16:52.100 --> 01:17:00.180
closest you'll ever get. I'll go buy adjustment again. Go ahead, Neil. What, how many copies

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:05.520
are we up to? We haven't had an update in a long time. Yes, I want you to look it up.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.020
The listeners demand to know this. What's new in your gaming world, Bobby? What types

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.500
of stuff have you been playing lately and enjoying? Believe it or not, recently I've

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:18.740
picked up, I got an old retro Japanese RPG kick. Recently started playing the original

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:25.260
Suikoden again. Oh. And it was mainly because somebody wrote me on my PS3 saying, why don't

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:29.620
you ever play games on your PS3? So I'm playing Suikoden. So you're playing a PS1 game on

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:37.300
your PS3. Nice. Yes. But it counts. I'm gaming on it. I'm not curing cancer. Your thing just

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:41.860
sits there on all the time. Well, not on, but it's sleeping mode or whatever, just curing

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:47.420
cancer all day, right, with folding it home. And I'm leading my team. Are you? I'm leading

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:51.780
the all games radio team. I stopped running that app a long time ago. But if I get a PlayStation

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:56.620
3, Bobby, we will work together, this Voltron of podcasts, to cure cancer, because only

01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:01.900
Voltron can cure cancer. Here's what we're at right now. We're still at 0.18 million.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:07.740
But the problem is it's not tracking the UK sales. But I can guarantee that they're not

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:13.580
any more than the US sales. So even if the number were doubled, you would still not be

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:20.340
to where you need to be. Very sad to hear that. So never going to happen. I'm not sad

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:27.220
to hear that. In fact, they only sold, was it week 10, which I guess was last week, they

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:34.500
sold 8,627 units in the US. Now how about copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever? I don't

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:40.420
even think that's on here. I don't think they're even tracking that one. I'll get back to you

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:46.260
on that. All right, please do. They're not tracking it because it's just too many. Yes,

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:51.660
that's right. It blew sales through the roof. Bobby, any other things that our listeners

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:58.380
ought to know about this whole All Games transition or anything they should know about allgames.com

01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:05.780
and why it's the place for OLR? Well, for one, no more ads if you try to listen

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:10.740
to the live stream and no more funky players that you have to click through things to get

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:16.740
to it, you go to allgames.com or you go to allgamesradio.com, which is a smaller version of our radio stream

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:23.380
and it just automatically plays. Or you can get it on your PSP or I think we're even in

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:27.640
the iTunes thing if it pulls from the shoutcast directory. Basically anywhere there's a shoutcast

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:33.700
directory, you can get to our stream. It automatically starts playing. You're listening to this station

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:39.060
and it's brought to you by this right now. So it's going to be very easy. It's a higher

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:46.820
quality, no more MP3 Pro, but we don't plan to have you guys change anything music-wise

01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:52.660
or anything. I know a lot of people are like, what about the music and stuff? Rob, you know

01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:57.460
that I'm willing to talk to you about that and maybe even doing a music block from your

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:02.540
library or even just merging your library of music into ours during the 24x7 stream

01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:07.380
and bringing some of your other talk programs over. I'm not keeping this only to the Sunday

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:14.700
night thing. Very cool. That's part of why it was a good idea. It's not just that All

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:21.780
Games is sucking this show up and tearing it away from what we had. I think one way

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:25.780
when we were talking about it was that it's now the resources of the three of us that

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:31.660
make this show happen and some of the other people behind OLR are now troops in the allgames.com

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:36.100
universe and can work towards building good ideas there. I think it's going to be great

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:40.740
because I know everybody over there has got ideas. Lord knows we have ideas of our own.

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:45.140
It's just going to keep going from there. It's going to be great.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:49.020
We'll send the camera crew up there for Loki and the Tingle outfit and everything.

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:54.900
Awesome. Can't wait. That would be awesome whenever that doesn't really happen.

01:20:54.900 --> 01:21:01.260
It will be at PAX. I will say this because I know you're thinking about coming up to

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:05.460
PAX. We're actually trying to do something really big at PAX in terms of live streaming

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:09.460
and I'm going up there. Kropotkin and Hendrix are actually coming out. Kropotkin is coming

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:16.940
out from the UK flying at PAX. We've got a couple of our Chatterbox is always up there.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:20.460
Evil Avatar is their 10th anniversary for evilavatar.com. They're doing a big thing

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:25.780
as well. Evil Avatar Radio is one of our affiliates. We're planning on doing some big stuff at

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:33.180
PAX. I'd love to see you guys represented with or without the Tingle outfit.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:39.820
It's mid-August, right? Last weekend in August. It's actually Labor Day weekend. It's the

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:43.620
same weekend as Dragon Con for those that attend Dragon Con.

01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:49.140
For you especially. That's a bummer. I chose PAX.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:54.540
PAX is more gaming anyway. Dragon Con is a little more D20s and stuff, right?

01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:59.140
Dragon Con is more let's all fawn over Joss Whedon and everything he's touched.

01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:06.180
Yes. I don't know. Dark Sakura might choose to go there. I wouldn't phrase it that way.

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:10.700
I think Joss is the man. Definitely. I haven't been to PAX. I want

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:15.580
to go. I like what I'm hearing and we'll have to see what we can do to make that happen,

01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:19.360
especially if it's a long weekend and it's that far off. I don't see why at least I can't

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.300
get up there. Hopefully, if the monies work out, we can get everybody up there somehow.

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.020
We might be able to make work. We have to get the wife to agree to let Loki go.

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:32.220
I might actually be able to go because we do our game conferencing at my work, which

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:37.240
is almost the same thing as PAX, except I get to learn a lot more about stuff coming

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.900
out and that kind of thing. Oh, we should have a good report after that.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:47.020
We'll see. The third thing about PAX for people, since

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:52.940
it is open to the public, and this is the way that I kind of explain it. PAX is exactly

01:22:52.940 --> 01:23:02.000
what people thought E3 was. All the cool stuff that was in people's head about E3, that's

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.080
exactly what PAX is. E3 wouldn't have lived up to it. E3 had the show floor, but that

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:13.640
was it. PAX has the show floor. It's got concerts at night. It's got community gaming areas.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:18.420
You can just get a bunch of your friends to rent a game and just take it to a console

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:22.700
and just sit there and play a game with your friends and stuff. That's a lot of stuff that

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:29.060
E3 didn't have. It's way more community oriented. It's basically what people thought E3 was.

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.780
People who had never been to E3, it's what they thought it was.

01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:33.620
Sounds like it's going to be a ton of fun. We'll definitely have to make that happen.

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:37.260
The only reason I didn't go last year, the only thing that stopped me from going last

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:42.180
year, is that my BFF from college got married that exact same weekend. She said if I did

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:48.300
not go to her wedding, I would be killed. This year, no one is getting married that

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:55.300
I know of. No weddings. Don't plan it during PAX because I want to go.

01:23:55.300 --> 01:24:00.020
We'll be doing live streaming from there, so we'd love to have you guys as part of it.

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:02.860
Excellent. We'll see what we can do, Bobby. Bobby, we've got to let you go because we're

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:06.260
going to wrap this show up. It's getting really late for you guys out there, so we're going

01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:08.860
to wrap it up. Kill the ferret.

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:15.420
We'll try. Have a good one, Bobby. We look forward to being partnered up with you on

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.900
Sunday nights. I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.980
It'll be a lot of fun on April 13th.

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:23.700
All right. That's D-Day. Have a good one, Bobby.

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:24.700
Always enjoy hearing from Bobby.

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:28.960
All right. We're going to close up the Skype line now. We're running a little long here

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.900
in Part B, which is okay. We can go as long as we want, and we'll get to continue to go

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:37.060
as long as we want on all games. They're not scheduling anything after us. It's beautiful.

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.160
All right. Loki did want to get to some last minute stories, so I suppose we should get

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.160
those out.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.140
We've got a ton of them now, thanks to you cutting me off all the time. Dick. Let's see

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:51.540
here. We'll just go down the list, then, of all the wonderful stuff, whether it be important

01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.900
or not.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:25:00.580
SoCom Confrontation comes out on the PSN, or the PlayStation Network, September 16th,

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:08.540
and a great addition to the SoCom series. It looks pretty, and yeah, look forward to

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:09.540
that in the fall.

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:13.260
Another game coming in the fall, Far Cry 2, that's coming to consoles. They'll release

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:21.380
Xbox 360 and PS3, as well as PC. No word on exactly when, but fall-ish area.

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:27.580
Madden turns 20 this year, and Madden 09 will be coming out August 12th, as well as a collector's

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:33.660
edition, which will feature exclusively NFL Head Coach 09, which I'm glad, because that

01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:38.520
game sucks, or at least looks like crap. I know the first one didn't sell very well for

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.620
me, and I don't want to push this one, so awesome.

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:48.740
And let's see here. There is a rumor about what Sega will be showing off at their Gamers

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:55.180
Day. Some of the stuff rumored in there, a brand new Knights game, and also a new Eternal

01:25:55.180 --> 01:26:01.700
Arcadia game. Some other stuff, of course, a preview for Sonic Unleashed, which I think

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:08.460
we've all seen that anyways, and a game called The Crucible, Evil Within. I hope that's not

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:16.820
based off the book, and you know where I want to go with this, and I'm just biting my tongue,

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:20.700
but that is too funny that they are actually thinking about putting a game about which

01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:27.100
trials out, which... I don't know if it's based on that, but...

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:30.300
You can't write that, folks. You can't write it.

01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:37.300
And Super Monkey Ball for the iPhone, tentative. Also, Samba de Amigo.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.740
Wait, Samba de Amigo on the iPhone?

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:40.740
No.

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.740
Oh. Oui. Oh. Okay.

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:49.340
Let's come out of this summer, by the way. Remember we talked a little bit a while back

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:53.740
about that homebrew game being made, Super Mario Fusion, that's going to have levels

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:58.180
featuring Mega Man and Halo and stuff like that? Well, they have a new video up now that

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:03.200
shows one of the new suits you can get from Mario, which is a Mega Man suit with all the

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:07.060
sound effects and stuff from Mega Man. There's also apparently a Halo Spartan suit that you

01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:11.460
can get from Mario as well, so looking for that game when that comes out eventually.

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:17.460
There's a rumor that some DS Lite colors are coming to the UK soon, including green, ice,

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:23.020
blue, and red, and I'm not surprised, because Nintendo likes to put out a ton of different

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:27.340
colors of these things. French retailer is listing Grand Theft Auto

01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:32.420
4 for the DS, although that might be a misprint, but who knows?

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:38.780
Let's see here... Echo Chrome's coming to the US, like we said, I think sometime in

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:44.640
April, for 10 bucks, so that's not bad. Right now, you can actually download on the

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:50.500
PlayStation Store R-Type command, if you want to play a demo of that for the PSP. That's

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:56.620
that one that's like a RTS R-Type game. It's kind of weird.

01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:59.500
Interesting. Another game coming out in April, Happy Tree

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:05.580
Friends, False Alarms, coming to Xbox Live Arcade. That'll be pretty interesting to see.

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:10.260
Speaking of Xbox Live Arcade, it's actually going to be down on April 1st, that's not

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:14.380
a joke, and they'll be doing some maintenance on there.

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:19.100
Another game actually coming out next week, and this will be cool if this is true, the

01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:26.940
Xbox Live Arcade game for this week, Mr. Driller Online. It has been spotted on the Japanese

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:32.380
Xbox.com site for 800 Microsoft points. It's going to feature two to four player multiplayer

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:37.740
battles, three to four player multiplayer tag battles, and single player standard driller,

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:45.260
single player quest driller 100 puzzles. That's kind of neat.

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:51.060
And that's it. All right. That was a lot of last minute stories. There's a lot of late

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:53.900
breaking stuff tonight, or just stuff we were too lazy to get to otherwise.

01:28:53.900 --> 01:29:03.580
And I'm going to post this in chat room. It's a wallpaper featuring portal warning signs.

01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:06.020
It's funny. All right. We'll check that out.

01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:10.660
Now, that's going to bring us to the end of our show, except we've got one more thing

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:15.700
to do, and that's go around and get everybody's final thought. Dark Soccer, your final thought.

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:21.580
Ferret. My final thought is, why did I go out and

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:25.580
get the Ferret? I could have just told her that I lost it forever.

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:27.700
I'm nice. That's my final thought. I'm super nice.

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:31.140
I could have kicked you. Loki, your final thought.

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:35.300
My final thought is, I want to get to playing some more games this week. I have a lot on

01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:40.260
my plate and a lot that I haven't gotten to yet, and hopefully we'll get some curling

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:46.500
action going on after the show on Justin TV. That's right. Hopefully the video cap works

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.740
this week as opposed to last week's price score.

01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:51.660
Well, that was the PSP, and the PSP apparently sucks for video outs.

01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:55.860
Yes. Final thought, lesson learned. I didn't know this before. Maybe I'm just stupid, but

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.500
if you want to do video out, you have to do component. You can't do.

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:03.320
You can't do games over composite, which is, you know, they don't seem to mention that

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.980
on the packaging for composite cables or anything. It's something you kind of have to learn,

01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:12.420
so I'd be pretty pissed off if I didn't have a high-def TV and I was trying to do video

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:17.320
out on that stuff. Apparently it works for UMD movies, but why they can't implement that

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:22.020
for, you know, the composite cables is beyond me. I don't know.

01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:25.620
All right. Well, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:29.740
you guys so much for tuning into us and downloading and supporting independent radio and independent

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:33.220
podcasting. Remember, if you like what you hear, just tell a couple of people you know

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:38.540
about the show. That's how we will slowly take over the world with our friends at the

01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:43.420
Voltron of podcasting. That's going to do it. We'll see you next week for the last show

01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:48.580
on Live 365. Although, honestly, for most of you folks that listen on the podcast forum,

01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:52.700
you're going to be like, what changed? Not a lot. So that's going to do it, though, for

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.700
this week. So until next time, we'll see you here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:31:04.700
