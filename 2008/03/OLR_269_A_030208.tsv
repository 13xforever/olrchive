13926	25013	Tonight, March 2nd, 2008, Metal Gear Solid 4 gets dated and bundled, Mario Kart Wii also gets a date and online texting, and could the game Road Rash be making a comeback?
31960	36465	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36505	43132	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43512	48457	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura.
48998	49198	Hi.
49578	50960	How are you, Miss Dark Sakura?
52261	54183	I'm well.
54522	55043	You're well.
55343	55783	That's good.
56264	57045	Yes, I'm well.
57285	57725	You're well.
57986	58286	All right.
58946	61929	I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well.
62490	63811	I'll explain why momentarily.
64172	64432	Okay.
64492	66995	But first I have to introduce the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
67635	67976	Hello.
68296	69077	How are you doing, Loki?
69217	69477	Good.
70078	70358	All right.
71041	72822	Sorry, I don't have anything extra for you tonight.
99835	101116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
122751	129954	And you ran it to the old router, and then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that.
130514	135476	So it's bouncing wireless to the router, to my laptop, wireless to the other router.
136857	150882	So right now, Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam, which is back this week, hi guys, is going through this router that goes through Loki's computer that goes to the router in the house, which goes to Comcast and the internet.
151062	151263	Yeah.
151763	152243	Amazing.
153621	156582	This is Uber Geek Tech Talk here on Orange Lounge Radio.
156602	157702	It's like a wireless orgy.
158122	158382	All right.
158782	164363	And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program.
164403	168424	I have something for Jamie, and it's actually her birthday present, and it's like six weeks early.
168584	168824	What?
169164	172665	Yes, I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early because it's something you have to prepare for.
172905	173145	Okay.
173385	174345	So I'm going to give this to you.
175126	180767	Plus, I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week, so I think this is a good time for me to give this to you.
180987	181267	Okay.
181507	182027	So here you go.
182768	182828	E!
182848	182868	E!
208117	208918	That's like close.
209038	209738	That's third row.
210619	211599	Third row tickets.
212160	213440	So quite excited.
213901	214621	Yay.
214761	215522	Oh my God, where is this?
216162	216482	Davis.
216803	216963	Really?
216983	217783	So it's not that far at all.
217803	218704	Cool.
219264	219744	There we have it.
220265	221786	So mark that date on your calendar.
221806	223187	It's May something something.
223407	224648	I'm doing that right now.
224848	225088	All right.
225108	226089	Happy, happy, happy.
226389	226709	There you go.
227904	230465	So I thought that would help after a poopy week.
230525	233666	And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else.
234046	235266	So I knew I had to tell you.
235346	237307	Or get tickets independently somehow.
237407	238447	I didn't even know.
238988	239688	I didn't either.
239808	240908	I got an email about it.
241468	242569	So there you go.
242609	244449	And I know Jamie loves the Margaret show and I do too.
244489	245309	She's pretty funny.
246270	248370	Hopefully she's not quite so political.
248450	250271	I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes.
250351	253332	But, you know, she's still somebody I like.
254372	255033	Yes, me and you.
255413	255873	Cool.
256053	256293	All right.
257884	258704	There should be two there.
258724	260045	I was like, okay.
260425	263947	I thought so because I was like, why, okay.
264227	265128	No, you have to take me.
265188	265588	I'm sorry.
265608	266008	Of course.
266569	267049	Of course.
267069	268029	No, this is so cool.
268910	269490	Thank you, Rob.
269610	269830	All right.
269850	270311	You're welcome.
270771	272872	Now we can get to talking about video games, yes?
273972	274153	Yeah.
274273	274533	All right.
274853	275773	So we're done with Tech Talk.
275793	277014	We're done with Oprah.
277434	280136	Now let's talk video games.
280196	282377	How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
284018	285679	My gaming week was...
288135	293319	Well, it was interesting because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2.
294360	298183	I picked it up and then I had other stuff to do because I watched Tron earlier in the week.
299204	300285	I was like, I love Tron.
300305	303087	I want to play Kingdom Hearts because of the whole Space Paranoids level.
304368	312275	And there was a lot of burnout and I watched Dan play a lot of burnout and I played a lot of Ragnarok.
314517	314857	That was it.
317981	318361	Alright.
319902	321482	Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?
321902	322883	My gaming week was okay.
323323	329145	I played, I actually picked up Poptapon, and I've been playing quite a bit of that.
329185	330766	In fact, that's what I was playing before the show.
331806	332266	It's fun.
332746	333307	It's different.
333487	333927	I like it.
334267	334567	I don't know.
334787	339969	It's very easy to play, but I guess it takes some time to build up your armies and stuff.
341448	350491	Then I played and actually purchased N Plus on Xbox Live Arcade, and that game's just as fun as the original N, so thoroughly enjoying that.
351571	370136	And I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week because we were having this party we have at the end of every month for our work, and this one happened to be leap year themed, and so they wanted Frogger, and they used my system to play Frogger, so I got to play some of that because no one else was touching it.
370996	375760	And then, um... I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey.
376240	377721	So, that's actually pretty cool.
377741	381765	I finally got to the point in the game where one of the characters dies.
382425	391312	You know, not necessarily a main character, but I was just very surprised on how, you know, everyone makes that argument of, like, video games being art and stuff.
391392	396596	Well, shit, I think there's a perfect example right there of how powerful they can make the story.
397017	397837	And it was pretty cool.
398257	399919	Um... So...
400598	402839	I'm about 11 hours into it now.
403359	404439	Still on the first disc, though.
405420	406940	And just taking my time through that.
407960	413142	And pretty much that's it, I guess, other than, you know, the usual Saints Row.
414423	417784	But no one wants to hear about that.
419044	420665	For the five billionth time?
421085	421305	Yeah.
421765	421945	All right.
423055	427918	Well, let's see, my gaming week, I also played Lost Odyssey, and I had much of the same experience as you did.
428218	435202	I got to the second disc, which means you kind of go through some big plot twists in the first event, or first disc, let's put it that way.
435642	440625	And I'm amazed by the game, and I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flack as it has been.
441045	448449	Although, you know, I do understand some of the little complaints about the game, and even one of them I find to be kind of annoying, and that is lack of save points.
448949	450210	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
475754	477816	And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour before I get to the save point.
477836	478136	I don't know.
478156	480118	It auto-saves, too, for some things.
480198	480919	Some things.
480959	482240	There are checkpoints, I guess.
482420	483201	Yeah, but not a lot.
484482	488266	I haven't had that problem with save points, but I don't know.
488286	489847	What do you think about the difficulty of the game?
490848	491669	It's not that difficult.
494948	497010	Some of the boss battles were surprisingly tough.
497930	503155	If you grind some of the way through there, because a lot of this game seems like it's very quick.
503595	508759	There's certain areas in the game where there's two or three sections of the map and then that's it.
508919	512202	And then you're on to the next section of the world or whatever.
512762	514504	It's very small.
515184	518147	But, I don't know, it wasn't that difficult.
518187	521810	You just grind a little bit and get your characters leveled up and
522543	523244	and it's pretty easy.
524125	533293	Also, I have the pre-order bonus so I have an item that gives me level 2 guard or whatever so I can block most of the shots and it does zero damage to me.
533354	534935	Nice, I don't have that.
535596	537478	That was something you got for pre-order, huh?
537698	537878	Yeah.
538339	540180	Hopefully they release that as a download thing later.
540200	541722	It'll probably come later on.
542062	544704	Let's go over to the chat room, because we always have the chat room has their own comments.
544744	546105	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com.
546686	549968	RawSteelUT says, it only sucks when you die an hour without a save.
550328	556013	Kind of true, but there's also some things where you go through cutscene, cutscene, cutscene, and then you have to fight a big boss battle.
556193	567582	So, I mean, I know you can skip cutscenes, but even then, sometimes you have to sit there, because some of the cutscenes are rendered with the game engine, so you have to kind of sit there and press A, A, A, A, A, A. You can also, you can pause it.
568445	570406	and HitTheBackButton for the cutscenes.
570446	573967	But what about the ones where they're actually talking to each other with the dialogue boxes?
573987	574848	You have to A-A-A.
575948	576708	I don't know.
576808	578229	Oh well, it doesn't matter.
578529	583831	It's honestly just a tiny little blemish in what is otherwise a magnificent game that deserves to be getting more attention than it is.
585372	588633	As far as other games I've been playing this week, I have been playing Super Smash Bros.
589514	592755	Brawl because I was...
593294	593955	Thank you for watching!
608155	612098	Obviously, last week I was sick on the show, and I'm happy to report I'm better.
612158	615361	I did have a sinus infection, so I had to go to a doctor and antibiotics and blah, blah, blah.
615641	618924	But Loki lent me that as kind of like a get-better-soon type thing, which was very nice.
619224	621326	He said I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time.
621366	623107	I didn't actually hook that thing up until, like, Friday.
623127	626430	That's exactly why I loaned it to you, because this is exactly what I'm doing.
626470	627671	I'm not playing Smash Bros.
628792	631014	Well, I mean, even before Smash Bros.
631034	633876	Brawl, I never played Melee very much.
634656	636458	Maybe once at a friend's house, you know, and
637085	638667	The first Smash Bros.
638787	640289	I didn't even touch.
640350	641571	So, I don't know.
641611	643994	It's not really my type of game.
644575	646478	It's fun, but, you know.
647754	649796	I may pick up the US one.
649856	651858	I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not.
652618	656562	Gerardimo in chat says, Rob, do you think Brawl lives up to the hype even if it's not in English?
658003	658464	Kind of.
658504	659264	It's hard to tell.
659685	665270	I don't feel right giving a fair review on a Japanese game when I don't understand how to get into some of the modes and look at the extra stuff.
665530	665870	It does.
667532	668773	Loki has no problem answering that.
669093	671976	The parts I've seen so far feel like
672839	701873	Smash Brothers Melee 1.5 a little bit because it's like the same kind of engine, the same stuff with just some new characters but I realize that's not being totally fair in saying that because I haven't looked at everything outside of just the brawling but it does seem like there's a lot of the stuff they just copied right on over from the GameCube version so very interesting Frisbee says Halo 3 feels like Halo 2.5 it's a little bit that I don't know how to say it but that's what it is
702805	704046	So that was my gaming week.
704727	711894	So if that's everybody's gaming week, then we will move on to talking about some news, but first some housekeeping, of which we have nothing special of note.
712435	712715	What's that?
712775	714137	We do have something special of note.
714177	715058	What's that?
715098	718561	The award contest thing that's going on through all games.
718581	719943	That's like three months old.
719983	721424	I can't believe you just saw that.
722165	723246	I did just see that.
724147	725949	Hey, I don't read, you know.
727386	727947	I didn't even notice it.
747617	751240	It's all games which our show runs on.
751280	752501	We syndicate on their network.
752521	757044	They play us Monday nights at, I want to say, 5 o'clock Pacific or 5.30 Pacific.
757124	758305	It kind of bounces around a little bit.
758986	760467	And then Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
760487	764290	I don't think... No, no, because they do their regular all-game show at 10 now.
764330	765951	So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings.
766252	770095	But I know our show is syndicated on their network, Mondays and Tuesdays, supposedly.
770135	772877	And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard as...
773337	776840	and Tiger Claw says Sky they still haven't announced the winners so I guess it is ongoing for three months now
803427	808509	So, and TigerClaw, I know, listens to all games like every other day or every day, so I know he would know what's up.
808529	808869	I don't know.
809169	812150	I voted for us, so.
812310	815631	Well, I appreciate the support, I guess, for yourself.
815991	821132	I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby, but he bought a knife judgment and I can't support that kind of behavior, so.
821152	822073	That's most unfortunate.
822393	823533	Yeah, it is unfortunate.
823893	825054	He also dropped out of the race.
825194	825614	Oh, did he?
826534	828095	As of, like, yesterday, so.
828135	829195	Didn't want to play that game, huh?
829850	830210	I guess.
830350	830630	All right.
830650	833651	Well, if you want to throw us a vote, it's over on forums.allgames.com.
833751	835851	I will plug the other stuff I know we always got.
835891	841592	We have our live journal community at Orange Lounge, our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio, and our Facebook is the OLR.
841632	843593	Be sure to look us up on our social networking sites.
844073	845753	Meet other OLR listeners.
846093	849734	Look at our posts and clips of the show we have on some of those places like MySpace.
850234	850714	Tons of fun.
851515	851695	All right.
851715	852755	Let's get into the gaming news.
852895	853515	Loki, take it away.
853888	861495	Okay, so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week from Destination, PlayStation, the retail-only conference thing or whatever.
862516	864778	I couldn't go, but other people from my company did.
865098	865498	Bastards.
866239	869382	And, of course, you know, some of the news that leaked out.
869482	871784	Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date, finally.
872324	873926	It's officially coming to the U.S.
874086	875367	on June 12th.
876348	880932	And that, of course, not only was leaked out, but confirmed by Konami.
881738	903319	and they also said that if you reserve your copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 starting April 2008 you get Metal Gear Saga 2.0 a DVD to catch you up on all the stuff that's going on in the series as well as a beta code for Metal Gear Online and then to coincide with that and this
904269	928575	I don't know if this is going to be the official, you know, remember because the 80 gig skew for the PS3 was being phased out, well there's a new 80 gig skew now, same price, but you get Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3 controller, all for $4.99, which is not a bad deal at all if you don't have a PS3, because I know a lot of people would be buying a PS3 for that, and it's nice that they're actually throwing in the DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that separately.
930461	935965	No word on when that's coming out, but it's supposed to come out around the same time as Metal Gear Solid 4, obviously.
936065	938526	So, June 12th and on, I guess.
941048	941428	Alright.
942549	947872	Well, moving on to other gaming news, although it still has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4.
949192	950933	Actually, let me back up for just a minute.
951334	956797	Loki, how important is this news to PlayStation fans, you think?
957386	958326	I think it's very important.
958366	963348	I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than the year-old MotorStorm.
963428	969710	They needed to update that bundle anyways, because, you know, shit, that game is old now.
970090	977913	And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game to throw in there, especially now that, you know, I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with the DualShock 3 controllers.
978073	986496	Probably not the 4Dig for right now, because there's supposedly, you know, the one right now doesn't have it, and I don't know if they're going to announce a new one anytime soon.
987028	989411	But it's important.
989551	995359	I think it's actually one of the first major games for the PS3 that you can only get on the PS3.
996220	999644	And that's a little bit of fuel to Sony's fire.
1000365	1002187	Although this is the first of hopefully many.
1002968	1005972	But it hopefully does very well.
1007000	1010904	Let's say Metal Gear Solid 4 does not sell all that.
1010965	1015450	I mean, let's say, you know, obviously the game's going to sell fine, you know, at least mediocre.
1015730	1019794	But let's say the game does not sell super duper well and doesn't move all these new bundles.
1019955	1023739	Is that going to be really bad for Sony or would they get more chances?
1023919	1027403	They may have more chances, but a lot of the stuff that they're counting on is like way later on.
1028361	1050634	Killzone 2 will be another one that moves systems Resistance, Fall of Man 2, maybe Motorstorm 2 Final Fantasy XIII, that's so far off that I wouldn't even consider that anything to wait for right now for the PS3 If you're going to wait that long, you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4 But at the same time, I don't know
1051371	1052592	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1071258	1074039	I was playing with their Blu-ray player a little bit, and it was slow.
1074519	1075980	It was so slow.
1076360	1081042	And I'm sorry, I know sometimes we get the mail, like, you guys always pick on Sony, we hate Sony.
1081282	1084743	Because if we hated Sony, we would still have a PSP-oriented website.
1084783	1086004	But anyway, it's beside the point.
1087284	1089725	But seriously, it was slow and clunky.
1089745	1092126	It reminded me, I guess, but... It's just first generation stuff.
1092146	1093026	Yeah, it's first generation.
1093046	1096928	I kind of think, okay, well, the first DVD player we ever had was kind of slow and clunky, too.
1097168	1099789	I remember when I had a single speed CD-ROM drive.
1099809	1102131	Now that's slow shit right there.
1102611	1103772	Well, Rob, you know what?
1103932	1104152	What?
1104772	1106613	I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-ray player.
1106873	1107053	Why?
1107254	1108514	We got an HD DVD player.
1108894	1109275	Did you?
1109615	1110675	Did you get the one for the Xbox?
1110896	1111256	Yes, we did.
1111416	1111956	Fifty bucks.
1112436	1112717	Nice.
1113417	1114618	Oh yeah, because they're so cheap now.
1115078	1115418	Yep.
1116459	1118420	Do you think you'll get enough library of movies to go with it?
1118440	1118800	Probably.
1118820	1121181	I guess there's enough out there to justify the fifty bucks.
1123809	1125070	I don't care where else Dan gets here.
1147992	1148672	But here's the deal.
1148732	1155896	If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4, you will get guaranteed access, quote-unquote, to this limited beta.
1156016	1160279	It's a little bit reminiscent, it seems to me, like the Crackdown Halo 3 thing, I think.
1160679	1162300	So, there you go.
1162720	1168083	But I'm sure most people that would be into Metal Gear Online are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4.
1168143	1176748	This is just incentive, I guess, to get pre-orders out there, which makes sense to me that Sony would want that, because they're going to want strong numbers out the gate as much as possible to try and
1177348	1183213	Put next to Halo 3 and what I'm assuming will probably be Smash Bros.
1183273	1184414	numbers and so on and so on.
1184574	1185535	Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.
1185595	1187596	It's kind of like their day one big seller that people wait for.
1187616	1190258	It's going to be the number one game for the console.
1190318	1199905	It's just Halo 3 may have been the number one game for the Xbox 360, but I don't think it's sold that many systems.
1199925	1202728	I mean, I'm sure there's people that waited to buy a system for Halo 3, but...
1204375	1204775	I don't know.
1205456	1208158	I don't believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game.
1208218	1214463	Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems but then again, their system is still more expensive.
1214663	1229474	It's a little easier now to make that purchase now that we know that Blu-ray is going to be the high def format of choice and Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now and we know when it's coming and plus now you have Grand Theft Auto 4 as well.
1230015	1233437	There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there but
1234417	1235058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1254678	1258899	There had been talk that Metal Gear Solid was going to be ported to PlayStation 2.
1260359	1261499	That's actually not happening.
1261719	1268420	It's just that the Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection is going to be on two DVDs.
1269361	1275802	It's supposed to be out on March 18th for $29.99 over here in the U.S.
1276142	1277502	It's going to be a PlayStation 1 game.
1278282	1278862	That's awesome.
1279702	1283083	Well, I wouldn't see... I mean, there would be no point to really remake, you know,
1284239	1286043	Metal Gear Solid 4, PlayStation 2.
1286424	1290152	Maybe there were people that were hoping that some of the... Because you know there was the GameCube one.
1290172	1291956	Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills?
1292970	1293931	When it came out, I don't know.
1293991	1294491	I think so.
1294651	1297533	Yeah, maybe people were kind of hoping some of those extra frills would come over.
1297953	1305057	I'm surprised they didn't put Metal Gear Solid 1 and then also have VR missions as well.
1305097	1318244	Well, my theory is that they are going to, this is again just my theory, because really all the VR missions was part of Metal Gear Solid Integral, which was basically Metal Gear Solid done as a first-person shooter.
1318304	1321606	All you need to do is put in the camera control and you can play it that way.
1323445	1326946	So they could easily include the VR missions and the, I guess, integral mode.
1329366	1329606	Hmm.
1331126	1331966	Well, it's neat.
1332487	1343028	Yeah, I mean, I guess it's not too, I mean, if this, you know, PlayStation is backwards compatible and all that, you know, at least what little backwards compatibility some of them have, it's not surprising that they only need to kind of put it out there on PlayStation 1 format.
1343668	1348589	Exactly, and if I remember correctly, I believe this collection's coming out in a couple weeks.
1349249	1350990	So, should be able to pick it up soon.
1351010	1352310	And it's cheap, 30 bucks.
1352510	1352830	Very cool.
1354346	1370236	A really cool, well, not cool for me because I already own a couple PSPs, but for someone that may not own a PSP yet, you can get a brand new PSP Slim that happens to be red with a giant head of Kratos silkscreen on the back.
1370296	1375419	This will actually be replacing the Star Wars Entertainment Bundle that they've had for a while.
1375800	1377861	You can no longer get those, unfortunately.
1379008	1389377	and of course it will be coming out I believe next week with the brand new game of course God of War Chains of Olympus and some other cool stuff that will come with this entertainment pack.
1390318	1400488	It will come with a copy of the Superbad UMD as well as a voucher to download Syphon Filter Combat Ops from the PC PlayStation Store.
1401775	1403997	Now here's my only little problem with this whole thing.
1404137	1407420	Usually these entertainment packs come with a 1GB memory stick.
1407960	1414305	I have heard no mention of a 1GB memory stick with this, so yay, I can download a game to nothing.
1414345	1416387	You have to buy a memory stick separately.
1416607	1417268	Way to go.
1417648	1418028	Awesome.
1419489	1422712	This might be a bad idea, but do you think we're just supposed to assume it's there anyway?
1424033	1425794	I don't think it is, because they would have mentioned it.
1425854	1431339	It would have been a selling point, but you know, hey, surprise me, maybe it is in there, but
1432683	1444385	I'm just going to take a wild guess and seeing as they didn't mention it, and I don't think it was in the press release, although I will double check in just a second here, I'm pretty sure it does not come with a memory stick, which is kind of sad.
1444766	1448426	Now, Alpha Canogram in chat says, Loki, bigger sizes are dirt cheap.
1448566	1449447	One gig is useless.
1450387	1456308	That's fine, okay, but the fact is it's still stupid to offer a free downloadable game
1456923	1458464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1484349	1485650	to save your games and stuff.
1485710	1486830	It's completely optional.
1486890	1488651	But, I mean, come on.
1488731	1492932	God of War, Chains of Olympus, and, like, Syphon Filter and this stuff, you're going to need a memory stick.
1493233	1495994	And it's just kind of annoying that, like, you get it all home or something.
1496014	1498135	You just say you get it for Easter or something like that.
1498835	1501816	And it's like, yeah, I'm ready to play this game.
1502036	1505397	Ah, shit, I got to go drive back down to the store to pick up my memory stick.
1506878	1507198	I don't know.
1507238	1508639	I think it's still kind of cheap.
1508919	1509619	But whatever.
1509939	1514081	I mean, if that's kind of your thing, then go ahead and purchase it.
1515154	1517535	And they'll probably be limited since the last one was too.
1519456	1524119	Although I think most people that are all crazy about God of War, most of them probably already have a PSP, don't you think?
1524599	1527541	That's always what amazes me about these bundles that come out so much later.
1528522	1530863	This is also coming out in June-ish.
1531183	1532764	I mean, around that time frame.
1532784	1535325	So it's going to be three months after the game actually comes out.
1536306	1536626	I don't know.
1537246	1539308	It's cool, I guess, if you don't have one yet.
1539368	1541789	Maybe you might think about picking this up, but
1542503	1543624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1551184	1555345	Another comment from chat from AkeRipper, I think that is, A-K-E, Ripper.
1556005	1560746	It's chat.orangeonstranger.com, says, Still, one gigabyte, you don't get far.
1561086	1561606	You know what?
1561866	1567467	I'm using my 16 megabyte memory stick that came with my original PSP.
1567607	1568768	Oh, 32 or whatever it is.
1568808	1571228	I'm using the old school original one from the first PSP bundle.
1571248	1571608	You know what?
1571628	1572088	That's fine.
1572248	1573869	I mean, see, that's the thing right now.
1574169	1575349	Okay, say you can't...
1576726	1578286	Just throw in a 32MB one.
1578346	1581228	Yeah, I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later, but hey, you know what?
1581248	1587832	At least it will get you through being able to save your game of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box.
1588012	1591654	And I'm sure since those 1GB memory sticks are what, $30 now?
1591734	1595116	The 32MB one should be like $0.50, if that.
1595276	1596297	I mean, so come on.
1596597	1597858	They've got to be sitting on a bunch of them.
1597898	1599499	Just dump that shit.
1601038	1601779	Hey, I'm not alone.
1615373	1616173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1646230	1666475	Warhawk is going to let eight people meet in like a war room area prior to a match and you can make out your strategies on a sand table that's like a replica of the different levels in the game and then you go right from there into your match so kind of kind of cute and then Resistance and Uncharted basically your avatars can go into levels from those games
1667105	1670548	And that would allow you to get to parts of the game that are even completely unseen.
1671089	1675613	Now, in addition to that, Uncharted is supposed to have a 2D shooter game that's built into it that launches from home.
1676414	1678276	See, so that's some cool ideas.
1678356	1681959	That sounds fairly generous and kind of neat.
1683160	1689927	You know, I imagine the shooter is cheesy, but it's better than nothing, and it's probably kind of one of those cool little integrations.
1691244	1695587	The news about Home is very exciting and it makes me wish it would have been out a lot sooner.
1695668	1698910	But, you know, okay, if the delays are making it better, then it's hard to complain, right?
1698930	1700991	It's all part of their plan to hopefully get more momentum.
1701052	1704874	I mean, this is also stuff that they can say, look, here, Live does not have this.
1705555	1707696	You know, this is why you should buy a PS3.
1707937	1713841	They're giving us reasons now why you should own a system, which is what they should have been doing since the beginning.
1714341	1717164	Frisbee in chat says, push it back until no one cares.
1717204	1717624	Am I right?
1718419	1721581	I don't know, but the more they drop little tidbits like this, it's hard to ignore.
1722401	1725824	Yeah, but at the same time, though, it's like, you know, Duke Nukem Forever.
1726064	1726704	Come on, dude.
1726804	1731667	I would like to see a little more video of this stuff in action, not just screenshots.
1732428	1737491	You know, just because video helps you get so much more of a sense of what it really looks like than pictures.
1737751	1743394	The trophy room thing, it's kind of neat, I guess, but at the same time, I'm just like, whatever.
1743894	1747697	Like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room and see a stupid dragon from Lair.
1747717	1748057	I'd be like,
1749008	1749468	Wow.
1749988	1751249	Testament that you played Lair.
1752349	1752989	Man, you suck.
1753790	1754190	Well, you know what?
1754210	1756931	The Xbox is the same thing with the achievements.
1756991	1762933	It's like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room of achievements that they've earned during Totem Ball or some shit.
1762973	1766094	This is where I played the game for 10 hours or something.
1766134	1767615	Wow, you have dedication.
1768735	1769716	You press start.
1769896	1770816	Achievement unlocked.
1770896	1772136	Wasn't that one in the Simpsons game?
1772176	1772757	Madden or...
1774304	1774985	Simpsons, maybe.
1775045	1775725	Or Avatar.
1775785	1777286	You hit something eight times in a row.
1777887	1778968	1,000 points unlocked.
1779368	1779889	There you have it.
1779909	1782671	I don't know, Jamie, you excited about Home on PlayStation 3?
1784032	1784612	Relatively.
1784912	1785133	Yeah?
1785633	1786814	I'm excited because it's free.
1786854	1789716	If I had to pay for that shit, I'm not playing in Home.
1789776	1790697	Free is a good thing.
1790957	1791858	Free is a very good thing.
1791898	1792538	It's hard to ignore.
1792839	1794140	Then again, Yaris was free.
1795020	1795821	Ooh, that is a good point.
1795861	1796922	Touché from Jamie.
1797482	1799544	Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record...
1803940	1810982	Well, there actually is a date now for that DualShock 3 over here in the U.S.
1811002	1817284	We're getting it on April 15th for $54.99, and I don't want that for my birthday, so nobody get it for me.
1820505	1826227	But it's, I mean, it's basically the, from what I can tell in here, the six axis with vibration, so...
1828757	1831158	So basically it's the controller that should have come out the first time.
1831218	1831998	It's finally coming out.
1832138	1835278	Yeah, except for all the crappy legal problems they were having.
1835699	1836919	Wait, what was the price again on that?
1837619	1838739	That's a $54.99.
1839019	1841640	$54 for a freaking controller.
1841660	1843260	But then again, Xbox is just as bad, right?
1843280	1845521	Isn't it like $59 for their wireless?
1845781	1845521	$49.
1846001	1847801	It's the same price as their current controllers.
1847941	1848661	He rumbles $5 extra.
1848721	1848861	I guess.
1852566	1854968	Xbox 360 controllers are way too expensive.
1878894	1879214	Really?
1879534	1879855	Oh yeah.
1879995	1881275	I haven't even really played with one ever.
1881295	1889140	The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the remote and nunchuck because the remote's $40 and the nunchuck's $20 so it's $60 all together.
1889540	1889841	I don't know.
1889941	1896305	I guess maybe for some reason I let Nintendo slip by a little more and I know people want to call it fanboyism but I don't.
1896345	1896985	Here's my logic.
1897285	1905770	I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price because that controller is really kind of like the core of the system and the motion and everything but I don't know.
1905790	1906791	I guess one could argue that
1907091	1913756	It's the same thing on the PlayStation 3, so... I don't know, but the motion shit on PlayStation 3 is very, like, kind of... Last minute?
1914236	1919379	Not really last minute, but just kind of... Well, I mean, a little last minute, but just kind of useless, I think.
1919640	1921721	I like this comment from AlphaCanogram in chat.
1921761	1922622	He says, Sky, wait.
1923122	1926224	Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube was most expensive.
1927025	1929306	That's true, because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance with cable.
1929646	1933189	And if you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles, you had to get four of those.
1933269	1936111	You know, we actually still kept our Game Boy Advances for that reason.
1937016	1938597	so that we could play Pac-Man Versus.
1938617	1944299	I was going to say, I can only think of like three games that even use that feature, no, four, because Animal Crossing was one.
1945080	1948601	Yeah, Animal Crossing, Pac-Man Versus, Crystal Chronicles, and Zelda.
1948841	1949142	Zelda.
1949242	1949602	Four Swords.
1949942	1952303	Yeah, and that's really it, just a handful of games.
1953544	1955985	But Pac-Man Versus is awesome.
1956885	1961587	And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii start to see more of that stuff too.
1961607	1964388	Didn't Pac-Man Versus come out on the Namco Museum DS?
1964789	1965409	Yes, that's right.
1966954	1967314	It's pretty cool.
1975200	1978522	Random thoughts, speaking of classic collections, just kind of make me go, huh.
1978922	1985166	I was randomly at a record store earlier this week, because I was, gasp, shock and awe, buying a CD.
1985346	1986146	I know, I know.
1986767	1990089	I was actually buying a CD, and this place sells video games as well.
1990109	1991169	They sell used video games.
1991790	2000054	And I actually saw on the play, and I was actually looking at, like, old Genesis and Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything, like, really, like, cool in the retro stuff.
2000074	2000835	It was all sports.
2001355	2002236	All sports stuff.
2002256	2004057	Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL.
2004398	2005279	So that's pretty much all they had.
2005359	2008862	But one thing I noticed on the PlayStation 2 was an Activision anthology.
2008902	2010683	And I never even knew this game existed.
2011724	2015507	Because the Activision releases an anthology on every system.
2015527	2016408	They have one on PlayStation 1.
2016588	2017669	They've had one on the PC.
2017749	2018910	I actually own the one on PC.
2019190	2019931	They've had a ton of them.
2020511	2025656	I didn't realize they had one on PlayStation 2, but I just thought it was funny because I'm reading the back of the box, like all the games that are in it.
2026136	2032140	and like this is how they're selling the game is that A, it talks about you can do cool effects to the games while you're playing.
2032180	2035162	Like you can play Pitfall but it's in a cube or something.
2035422	2041446	But then the other thing, I thought it was really funny because it lists all these games and underneath that it says never before seen in an Activision compilation.
2042967	2047109	Pitfall 2 and some of these other like really obscure Activision games.
2047269	2050411	Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure but the other ones that were listed were very obscure.
2051732	2052352	Like Bridge.
2052492	2052833	What's that?
2053813	2055014	I think I'm going to order a freeloader.
2055970	2057351	Freeloader Phil Harrison Crazy Guy
2083483	2084224	Ken Kutaragi
2115535	2115915	I don't know.
2116976	2117997	But that is weird.
2118037	2121680	If it's true he went to Atari, that's kind of like... I don't know.
2121760	2123202	But maybe he can help fix things there.
2123222	2123662	I don't know.
2124082	2126024	That'd be nice to see them turn around.
2127918	2137080	All right, well, you know, with all this talk about Lost Odyssey and what a great RPG it is, sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out where they were actually really amazing.
2137180	2141401	One of them was Persona 3, and I admit I did not get to really play much of Persona 3.
2141641	2143861	I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is.
2144161	2152703	But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it, because apparently Persona FES, which is an expansion to Persona 3, is actually coming out here in the U.S.
2152943	2153123	on Xbox.
2153453	2154914	April 22nd and it'll set you back $29.99.
2156275	2164881	But the cool thing about it, now obviously this is a PlayStation 2 game, it's not in the current gen of consoles, it's in PlayStation 2, but obviously that's what a lot of people still have.
2165941	2175508	But for such a low price for such a huge game, you get both the enhanced version of Persona 3 and new bonus features and a new chapter that is apparently 30 plus hours.
2175948	2178750	So this is kind of like Oblivion Game of the Year Edition, but for Persona.
2179510	2180651	For $30, which isn't bad.
2181175	2183336	There's still pretty good stuff coming out on the PlayStation 2.
2184736	2191339	And luckily, though, a lot of the people that put out really crappy shovelware games for the PS2 have now moved to the Wii.
2191439	2194020	So you get a pretty good crowd, although there are still some.
2194260	2201062	But luckily, though, they've adopted the price point of $14.99 retail, which, you know, you can't beat that, even if it does suck.
2202463	2208145	Well, you can download a lot of games for $5, so I don't know, $14.99 still feels too expensive for me.
2208598	2212160	for a crap game, you know, Hannah Montana Goes to College or whatever the hell they put out.
2212601	2212841	What?
2213401	2213702	I don't know.
2213742	2215363	I pulled that name out of thin air.
2216503	2217384	You want to know what sad is?
2217424	2218625	I think that they would make that game.
2218985	2219666	They just might.
2219966	2220626	Patent pending.
2221207	2222207	She'd go to college.
2222247	2222868	She's rich.
2223228	2225990	I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana or the trailer.
2226010	2228492	Even if I were really rich, I would want to be fully educated.
2228912	2229192	True.
2230253	2231714	But then again, if you're, you know...
2233019	2234880	A puppet of Disney, then.
2235481	2239883	In my mind, it's a sitcom, just like Saved by the Bell went to college at one point.
2240704	2244166	I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney Channel stars need to go to college at some point.
2244226	2245387	That's their exciting new surroundings.
2245407	2246727	That would have saved Britney from her fate.
2247188	2247628	Perhaps.
2248228	2249509	Goofy goes to college.
2250950	2251390	Gorsh!
2251630	2252771	Can I read the next story, please?
2252791	2253131	You may.
2253472	2253792	Okay.
2254592	2259075	Well, Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out.
2259853	2267457	It says it'll be out in time for the winter holiday, to be politically correct.
2267737	2270659	I'm so excited that they're releasing Game On Festivus.
2273260	2273981	Decemberween.
2274581	2275842	Gives you something to celebrate.
2277763	2279744	So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?
2280244	2284547	It's island-themed, which is so, you know, wintery.
2286107	2287068	That might be kind of fun, though.
2288569	2290590	I did think the first one had too much dirt.
2291531	2292871	This one seems to have plenty of dirt, too.
2292891	2294572	It's in the middle of a desert.
2295573	2296413	I'm sorry.
2297213	2298414	Too much dirt for you.
2299355	2300615	Although, you know what?
2300715	2308339	I really have to say that the artist's joystick where we got this information from are very creative.
2308959	2315682	I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon because I don't think they've done a good off-road moon racing game.
2316003	2316523	Actually...
2318163	2319723	There was Cruisin' World.
2319883	2322444	Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX?
2322484	2324244	Cruisin' World had you go play on the moon.
2324264	2325225	Yes, Cruisin' World.
2325265	2329486	And then you ran into aliens that had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub.
2330486	2331586	Mahalis in chat.
2331626	2332566	I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
2332846	2334087	We have a lot of new chatters tonight.
2334107	2334647	Welcome all you guys.
2334867	2336847	Mahalis in chat says, Moon Patrol.
2337828	2338548	Damn straight.
2338588	2339548	That's old school right there.
2339568	2340208	Moon Patrol.
2340228	2341868	That's all the moon game you need.
2342169	2344149	But Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?
2344850	2346531	Hannah Montana goes to her first frat party
2374707	2375788	Hannah Montana goes wild.
2376488	2378630	Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs.
2380271	2380952	It's inevitable.
2381032	2382633	Hannah Montana gets a podcast.
2382833	2384294	They already do crap like that.
2384354	2385635	It's called the evening news.
2385875	2386255	There you go.
2386296	2386956	Mahalas again.
2386996	2388257	Hannah Montana goes to the moon.
2388297	2388757	There it is.
2388877	2389278	Right there.
2389318	2390959	Like two things we need right together.
2391119	2391399	All right.
2391679	2392120	Enough of this.
2392280	2395022	I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana, but it's funny.
2395042	2396323	We do not need more Hannah Montana.
2396703	2398004	We need less of Hannah Montana.
2399445	2400426	What we do need more of is...
2401351	2403151	is more colors than PS3.
2403672	2406272	And there is a rumor... I was just thinking that!
2407452	2407913	I know!
2407933	2408693	No, I wasn't, actually.
2408873	2410013	I can read minds.
2411193	2414014	It's a... It's a skill I learned.
2414354	2415734	Okay.
2416175	2419675	So, there is a new SKU coming out for the 48-gig PS3.
2419715	2426037	I know this for a fact, because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3, the Blu-ray, because Sony thinks, you know what...
2426630	2427710	Blu-ray is the winning format.
2428191	2430291	We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3.
2431412	2433493	You will just buy your own fucking Blu-ray movies.
2434733	2437114	So there is going to be a new SKU coming out.
2438214	2444537	And apparently, some Circuit City employees have begun receiving their shipments of these new PS3s.
2445017	2449258	And on the shipping box, there is a model number, which is CECHH01.
2451543	2463846	And for those who may remember a while back when we covered that the FCC had an item filed from Sony regarding a white PS3 while the item numbers happened to match.
2464546	2471288	So is it going to be the white system coming out to replace the black one with the Spider-Man 3?
2472408	2472668	Maybe.
2473389	2473709	I don't know.
2473729	2474749	We'll have to see, I guess.
2477665	2479387	But if that's the case, it's going to be coming soon.
2479487	2488694	Are there really people that are like... I mean, do these people really, really exist that are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3 until they release them in white?
2489535	2491036	Or until they release them in red?
2491356	2492898	Or what other colors have we talked about?
2493178	2496361	The silver thing that we talked about on other shows in other countries.
2496461	2497962	I don't think that... Are there really those people?
2497982	2499043	I don't think that there are.
2499223	2502166	But, I mean, people maybe with the DS because it's cheaper.
2502806	2504848	But I don't think color is really going to...
2506599	2508900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2533973	2537474	I think, with Nintendo though, it's inevitable that they're going to come out in other colors.
2538094	2539354	That is still a little crazy.
2539774	2544075	Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing, but you'll notice, whatever happened to the pink Wii's?
2544435	2545075	Whatever happened to that?
2545095	2546276	And the blue Wii's and the green Wii's?
2546576	2547236	Whatever happened to that?
2547856	2549196	They didn't need to do it, that's what I guess.
2549956	2552857	SSJ100Matt says, Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3.
2553517	2554017	Damn right.
2554477	2556218	I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3.
2557038	2557798	That would be the best.
2559639	2561921	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to join in.
2561941	2568306	We do try to keep an eye on Justin TV's chat room as well, but sometimes I have a hard time staying on top of that because that's two different chat rooms.
2568807	2569227	That's a lot.
2571068	2581957	Something you're going to be able to play on those white PlayStations would be lots and lots of games coming to the PlayStation Store.
2581977	2585000	25 old school titles have been leaked online.
2585842	2586122	P.E.G.I.
2607732	2608713	Crash Bandicoot 3 Crash Bandicoot 3
2626843	2634589	Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3, Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies, Everybody's Golf, Klona, Klonoa, sorry.
2635149	2636550	Klonoa is like the best game ever.
2636570	2640954	Kurushi Final, Motor Toon Grand Prix, Namco Museum 1, 2, and 4.
2641034	2642555	I don't know what happened to 3.
2643235	2652602	Omega Boost, Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4, Roll Cage, Spyro, Tekken 2, 3, Twisted Metal, Vib Ribbon, Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097.
2652762	2653463	Vib Ribbon!
2653979	2654460	Lots of stuff.
2654480	2655020	Yeah, Vib Ribbon.
2655040	2655361	Vib Ribbon.
2655381	2656061	That's pretty awesome.
2656081	2656902	That is pretty awesome.
2658364	2659405	That game is crack.
2660185	2666432	And actually, I don't know if a lot of people remember, Colony Wars is actually pretty decent as far as the space shooter goes.
2667233	2667953	They have cool borders.
2667973	2668474	That's pretty fun.
2668654	2669855	Omega Boost is awesome.
2670076	2672158	Son of Dad says Intelligent Cube, please.
2672818	2673179	There you go.
2673801	2674921	Don't they have the PSP one?
2674941	2677062	Didn't they come out with a sequel-ish thing to that game?
2677082	2678222	Yeah, they have a couple of them.
2678342	2684043	And let's see, CrunkyBoyJr in chat says, I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared it right up.
2684463	2689284	Hey, Klonoa was a great game, but it was messed up at the end.
2691105	2693045	I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you.
2693305	2693565	Nice.
2694525	2702327	So, in other bundly news, in Europe they're going to get a pretty decent bundle, I'm going to say, that is...
2703467	2730560	The Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle And it's a 40GB PS3 I'm sorry, my apologies, 80GB Oh, sorry, they're doing two of them, my apologies I was just staring at the red box because it's, well, kind of red and black and very cool colored And it's got a silver car up on the front of it, I can't see what it is though
2731892	2744267	But they're saying that it's going to be out on, looks like March 29th, and retails for €3.99, so that's pretty cool.
2749161	2751722	I love all this hubbaloo over Prologue.
2751942	2754342	It's not even the actual game, it's just Prologue.
2754362	2758663	You know, to be honest, I think this game's going to hurt their sales for the full game.
2758863	2759143	You think?
2759163	2767525	A lot of people, like, you know, if I had to buy a Gran Turismo game, I don't think I'd buy the full one because I don't race 200 cars.
2767826	2770446	You know, there's only a few cars that I'd actually probably race.
2771146	2777988	And, you know, after I play this game, you know, Prologue, for however many months until the full game comes out, I'll probably be sick of it.
2778692	2779272	www.DarkSakura.com
2798984	2803786	Ross Steel UT in chat says, Loki, Gran Turismo isn't for you, it's for crazed car freaks.
2804147	2805927	There's another bundle listed on here too.
2805948	2806828	What's that?
2806888	2815072	A Blu-ray bundle, the 40 gigabyte PS3 with Spider-Man 300 and Casino Royale on March 19th.
2815492	2823215	Now that's reasonable, you know, because obviously now that Blu-ray has officially won or whatever, that's, you know, totally understandable.
2823255	2827077	There's a lot of people that are going to buy PlayStation 3s just because it plays Blu-rays and games.
2827477	2829238	You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people to do that?
2829278	2831119	Because that's how PlayStation 2 won.
2832039	2833260	Hey, I bought my PlayStation 2.
2834000	2835841	Well, actually, no, I didn't buy it as a DVD player.
2835861	2839923	I just bought it because Armored Core was coming out on it, and I love me some Armored Core.
2840663	2842164	Except they didn't buy Armored Core 4.
2842564	2842784	Whatever.
2844312	2846013	I liked what Actdeft in chat says too.
2846133	2852755	Actdeft says Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Gran Turismo 5 Introduction, Gran Turismo 5, and then Gran Turismo 5 Epilogue.
2855395	2858296	And yet, no Gran Turismo Portable for the PSP.
2858316	2860617	It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series.
2860837	2863198	It's like Final Fantasy 7 games now at some point.
2864638	2869140	And they'll have Final Fantasy Prologue with cars.
2869880	2870500	Gran Turismo...
2871264	2873965	There's different kinds of chocobos.
2876585	2878385	You get to try out different chocobos.
2878625	2881626	Well, you may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5.
2881666	2884127	There are plenty of other games to get your attention this week.
2885067	2889168	Starting things off, we have Bully Scholarship Edition coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360.
2889508	2896089	It's slightly better than, I guess, the PlayStation 2 version because it has slightly better graphics and a few more missions.
2896509	2896709	Great.
2898380	2902624	The game I teased last week, Let's Ride Friends Forever, coming out on the DS.
2903564	2906066	Worst name ever.
2906306	2910690	If you're into baseball... Or most unintentionally funny name ever, depending on how you look at it.
2910850	2912091	There's going to be two games for you.
2912451	2918476	Sony's MLB08 The Show, and that's coming on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PSP.
2918877	2924941	And then MLB2K8, coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360.
2926554	2932219	Army of Two on PS3 and Xbox 360 Chicken Hunter on the DS Imagine Figure Skater I'm almost offended by that comment.
2955058	2957239	I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to figure skating.
2957279	2957960	Yeah, exactly.
2960541	2961682	Let's see what else we have here.
2962542	2966885	Also, Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC.
2967545	2967886	Awesome.
2970087	2972828	Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week.
2973809	2977831	God of War Chains of Olympus coming out on the PSP.
2978031	2979072	That looks pretty awesome.
2981473	2982414	Pets Bunnies
2983240	2984701	Super Smash Bros.
2984721	2986242	Brawl Ninja Reflex Ninja Reflex
3011950	3015631	Mystery Dungeon, Shirin the Wanderer coming out on the DS.
3017971	3025413	Let's see, we've also got Spitfire Heroes, Tales of the Royal Air Force.
3026293	3028174	That's on DS as well.
3029034	3033215	And Homies Rollers on the DS.
3033395	3040077	That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures that you can get out of those machines for 10 cents or 25 cents.
3040097	3041117	My boss used to collect those.
3046008	3047770	I believe that's it.
3048671	3050853	Smash Bros Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week.
3052694	3058139	I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance, but maybe there's a certain audience for that, I don't know.
3058539	3059520	I will tell you what.
3060721	3061241	Uh-oh, what?
3061862	3067486	If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies... Oh no, here we go, here we go, okay, yes, yes.
3067847	3070449	If Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies, yes, what?
3071295	3074316	We'll do the whole Tinkle thing and we'll burn Eye of Judgment.
3074356	3075416	We'll need another game in there.
3075916	3076856	You know, more of a chance.
3078076	3079977	You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?
3080577	3081677	Yeah.
3081737	3082097	Great.
3082917	3088678	The makers of that game just thanked you for selling, like, you know, about 100 additional copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise.
3088698	3089958	Here, I'll make it even more fair.
3090018	3093879	The combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever... Whoa, whoa!
3093919	3097960	So the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment now... Yes.
3098804	3102326	Oh, because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell 100,000 copies.
3102446	3104547	Somebody mark the date and time of this.
3104647	3108729	Oh, it's almost exactly 7 o'clock here on Sunday evening, March 2nd.
3108749	3110250	We'll never sell anything, okay?
3110270	3110530	Come on.
3110550	3111070	All right.
3111531	3113972	Well, that's something that's given the listeners.
3114312	3117134	That's for the little meter some of the chatters made up.
3117554	3122856	Some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that looks like a telethon thing, and it's like the road to one million copies.
3122877	3123657	It'll never happen.
3123697	3125158	Now it gives them something to add to that.
3126378	3127619	It'll never, ever happen.
3129878	3140247	Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never ever sell Here's the thing, chatroom You gotta get him to keep adding games to it until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total
3143408	3146469	Oh yes, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that.
3146529	3148509	Gold Bandra says another one for the OLR wiki.
3148589	3149770	I forgot to mention Housekeeping.
3149790	3150850	This would have been good.
3150970	3153811	They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio.
3154491	3156852	And you can wiki stuff on it.
3156912	3160453	Even though I guess... Well, we have an official Wikipedia article.
3161073	3164214	But now we have our own freaking entire wiki.
3165034	3171216	Which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really... You'd think I wrote it or Loki wrote that article, but we've never...
3172842	3174043	Really worked on that.
3174083	3176465	It was totally the fans that did that, so that was really cool.
3177606	3178867	I haven't even seen it.
3179648	3180289	On Wikipedia?
3180989	3183752	Oh, well, I thought you meant on Wikipedia.
3183772	3185633	Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia.
3185673	3186714	A wiki set up for us.
3186734	3189477	Yes, but now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki.
3189857	3191198	That's what I was talking about.
3191238	3193781	Yes, I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out.
3193841	3196603	It's orangeloungeradio.wikia.com
3199605	3199885	XBOX 360 ARCADE
3224631	3225772	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3241229	3242349	Thank you for watching!
3257914	3260434	I guess we're not the only ones that have to wait for big titles sometimes.
3260655	3261935	It looks like Japan had to wait for this one.
3261955	3262935	That's kind of surprised me.
3263195	3265255	And I look to see if it's a price reduction or something like that.
3265275	3265615	It's not.
3265675	3266376	It's full price.
3266396	3267816	So this must be the first time they're getting that.
3268276	3270416	So that kind of surprised me.
3270876	3273997	Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin.
3274337	3277778	And it comes with a... Online, I think.
3278058	3280418	But it comes with what's called a power-up kit.
3281138	3283839	And I'm not exactly sure what a power-up kit has in it.
3284319	3285499	So this is something they're...
3286277	3287098	They haven't released two yet.
3287118	3288678	Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games.
3289519	3289659	Perhaps.
3289679	3292701	They did the same thing with Devil Kings or whatever they call that over there.
3294362	3296643	I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes.
3297844	3298344	It's drugs.
3299045	3299325	Perhaps.
3299345	3301466	But it does look like another version of Nobunaga's Ambition.
3301506	3303467	Dang, the last time I played this game was on the NES.
3303867	3304808	And look how far it's come.
3305448	3306409	It's like Civilization.
3307510	3308310	I remember Civ 1.
3308350	3309231	I have such fond memories of that.
3309251	3314814	They had a Nobunaga's Ambition game that came out at the beginning of February for PlayStation 2.
3315871	3318092	Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore.
3318132	3319553	They're too complicated for me.
3319793	3321814	I'm not smart enough to play those games, I'll admit it.
3322494	3324415	I think that's just exactly what it boils down to.
3324955	3326116	They're too much for me now.
3326136	3326776	They get too complicated.
3326796	3329797	They need a Nobunaga's Ambition party game.
3329977	3334059	Yeah, they need like, you know how they like dumbed down Madden for Wii owners?
3334619	3335160	That's what I need.
3335180	3337201	I need a dumbed down version of Nobunaga's Ambition.
3337241	3338861	Swing the remote down to Conquer Japan.
3339562	3339902	The end.
3342096	3343497	It's too bad they don't have achievement points.
3344158	3347701	And I accidentally closed out my list, so I'll tell you what.
3347741	3349122	Why don't we go to Europe and then we'll come back to Japan?
3349142	3349562	Well, you know what?
3349622	3350623	That actually makes me think.
3350663	3353005	Did we ever get a current-gen release of Risk?
3355106	3355887	Not that I can think of.
3356187	3358229	But wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?
3358309	3360651	It'd be cool if we had Risk and Axis and Allies.
3360691	3361331	Wouldn't that be cool?
3361432	3363753	That would be very cool.
3363773	3364734	I love games like that.
3365054	3365255	Oh, wait.
3365295	3366516	I got the Japanese release dates back.
3366796	3367096	Never mind.
3367677	3368177	Fine.
3368577	3369738	Europe can wait a little longer.
3369758	3370419	They're used to it.
3372742	3373202	Hit what?
3373242	3374083	Below the bell.
3374183	3374823	I'm sorry.
3375003	3375543	Party foul.
3375744	3378885	Dear European listeners, please send Rob a smack in the head via email.
3378905	3379766	Send me your cards and letters.
3382167	3382487	Whatever.
3382527	3384148	They get, like, Mario Kart early.
3384228	3384988	Yeah, that's right.
3385149	3386349	So, you know, shut up.
3387270	3388570	Go stuff yourself with a carpet.
3389591	3393033	Hey!
3393413	3394293	I love Britain.
3394313	3395434	I love all of Europe.
3395834	3396515	I love France.
3396595	3397175	I love Spain.
3397215	3397675	I love them all.
3398135	3398436	All right.
3399376	3400597	On the PlayStation 2...
3401906	3404067	Also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well.
3404427	3405167	And guess what?
3405287	3415010	As if there wasn't enough pachinko in your life, Hisuu Pachinko Pachislot Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well.
3415290	3423293	By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of pachinko, because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that.
3424185	3432733	on the Nintendo DS, Bomberman gets a price cut, Dorimon, Nobita Ton Midori no Kyojinden DS comes out.
3432953	3434555	In other words, it's Dorimon on the DS.
3436434	3464465	and lastly on the PSP and then I promise we can do the Europe dates Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable that is a combo kit of those games it's like an Ultimate Hits so there you have it and also Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits the Lenneth and what was the other one Slamera or whatever it was called they both move into the Greatest Hits Collection alright now that all of Britain hates me and Europe in general
3465652	3467172	Let's go to their release dates, shall we, Jamie?
3467832	3468272	Fine.
3469013	3474694	Well, these are all on the 7th, and one of them pisses me off, but I have a certain bias against it.
3475634	3493357	Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Blackside Area 51 on PS3, Bully Scholarship Edition, Xbox 360 and Wii, Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed on Wii, Dynasty Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Jack Kane on PC,
3494768	3509378	MX vs. ATV Untamed on a bunch of crap, Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one, The Destiny of Zorro on Wii, Victorious Boxers on Wii, and the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K, Dawn of War.
3509899	3511740	Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?
3511760	3512440	Victorious.
3512841	3513661	Oh, Victorious.
3513681	3515002	I thought you said Victorious.
3515382	3517964	And I'm thinking, like, is that like Victorious Closet for Men?
3518124	3518905	Like, now they're expanding?
3518925	3520566	I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls.
3520586	3521787	You mean Victorious Secret?
3523148	3523748	She has a penis?
3524704	3526186	I thought you said Victoria's Closet.
3548376	3548737	I hate Warhammer 40k.
3548757	3548837	Why?
3562921	3563682	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3588570	3593791	And that's all he ever did, so yeah, I broke up with him to play with, you know, to hang out with some guy that played Rift.
3594611	3604573	It was fun, though, running over those little figurines with a toy train, because, you know, if you're going to build your own landscape, you might as well already have a train set and landscape built already for that.
3605694	3611395	Well, I can understand having a project, that's one thing, but when your entire life is your project, that's a little something else.
3611455	3612295	That and he didn't have a job.
3612755	3612935	Yeah.
3613467	3620733	Speaking about building little figurines, Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spin-offs for different games, including Indiana Jones and Star Wars.
3621133	3625777	Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo.
3626458	3635385	As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue, but they have screenshots to prove that it's real, you know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts, but...
3636806	3647053	The minute I saw a headline that said April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was, I was like, oh, haha, funny April Fool's joke.
3647093	3647994	I hate April Fool's.
3648154	3650295	Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate April Fool's.
3650415	3651956	It would be cool if it were real.
3652176	3654418	I don't think it is, and I don't think you would try it.
3654438	3654878	It's not.
3654918	3655479	Come on.
3655559	3659021	You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine, you know.
3659992	3663213	and of course it's their exclusive they say and stuff like that.
3663633	3670155	Trust me, if this wasn't a real exclusive, 1up.com would be whoring the shit out of this right now, okay?
3670195	3675156	Because they like to tease their exclusives, so whatever.
3676096	3678717	You don't need any more Halo or Lego Halo.
3680250	3680990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3705709	3706569	Thank you for watching!
3734839	3736200	and turn back into game data.
3736501	3737922	What a weird concept.
3738062	3738983	It's treasure.
3739163	3745609	The other thing you can do with this is you can put them in MP3 format or whatever and spread them out on the internet so people can download them that way.
3746490	3747050	It's treasure.
3748852	3754337	It's kind of neat, I'll admit, but when I first read this, I'm like, this is the weirdest thing I've ever heard.
3754653	3756073	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3781898	3782559	Thank you for watching!
3798289	3820135	and put it in a regular CD player and if you know what I'm talking about you're old school because we did this in junior high we would take a copy of Encarta and put it in a regular CD player and it makes the most hideous noise and what you do is it was like the dumbass joke you would play is that you would turn the radio thing up full blast close the door and run ah yes
3821522	3832569	I just remember putting them in, especially they'd also do it on PC Engine Duo desks who say, this is a game disc, do not listen to this or your speakers will die.
3833450	3834010	That type of thing.
3836705	3837886	Very interesting feature.
3838546	3847592	I have to admit, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought to go run out and buy or even really check out just because there's too many other games on the table, right?
3847953	3851375	But now I'm kind of like, I might have to look at this game just for this feature.
3851775	3853957	I'll tell you in one word why I'm getting this game.
3854337	3854517	Why?
3854777	3855217	Treasure!
3856738	3857299	I should have known.
3857519	3858379	Treasure!
3858800	3860861	There's no reason why I'm still looking for Chameleon Twist.
3861742	3863723	Alright, well, let's move on.
3863743	3865324	That's all I have to say until the game comes out.
3866027	3886540	Well, I know that quite a number of our listeners are into rock band, so something that everyone should be happy about is that there is a Grateful Dead pack coming out for a rock band that will have China Cat Sunflower, Casey Jones, Sugar Magnolia, Truckin', Franklin's Tower, and I Need a Miracle.
3887661	3891223	I think that that's pretty cool, because Grateful Dead is pretty cool.
3892102	3897346	Now, I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit, because that would be the full dead experience right there.
3897366	3897886	You know what?
3898786	3899647	You laugh about that.
3900027	3902729	Apparently, okay, one of my customers... Oh, no.
3902749	3903350	No, no, no, no.
3903410	3904330	Not about the weed thing.
3904670	3913496	No, one of my customers actually saw the kit set up at one of the GameStops, I guess, in Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from.
3914257	3914397	And...
3917062	3917582	Thanks for watching!
3928667	3930508	and they react to the sound that you do.
3930528	3933990	So we could do the show and it would react to our speaking and stuff.
3934310	3935311	Just what we need.
3935911	3936752	I'm sorry, DarkSakura.
3936772	3938413	Well, there's a little bit more to this story.
3938933	3950039	For people who are not so rock band oriented and are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented, actually No Doubt's having some releases on there, which No Doubt, cool.
3950199	3952721	Gwen Stefani's solo, bad, because she sucks.
3953521	3955122	That and she's got mental problems, but...
3955638	3956058	Moving on.
3956219	3957459	Wow, tell us what you really think.
3957580	3959541	What songs are coming out from No Doubt, do we know?
3959921	3962924	Don't Speak, Excuse Me, Mister, and Sunday Morning.
3963644	3964885	So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend.
3965626	3966567	That's the song I love.
3966747	3969529	No, no Just a Girl, no Spiderwebs.
3969709	3972651	But, I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list, so I'm happy.
3973312	3973872	What song is that?
3974072	3974473	Don't Speak.
3974633	3975053	Don't Speak.
3975313	3978296	All right, let's hear some clips of these songs that are coming to Rock Band very soon.
3978336	3979857	Here's a clip of the Grateful Dead.
3979937	3981598	So if you got them, smoke them.
3982018	3982699	Just kidding, that's bad.
3999322	4002863	Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in Rock Band.
4002903	4012326	And then we have coming to, not coming to Grateful Dead, coming to Guitar Hero 3, we have No Doubt.
4012546	4017508	And I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak, so let's play one of the more lesser known songs, which would be Sunday Morning.
4037558	4041400	At least I'm glad I breathed some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band in general.
4041540	4044022	Rock Band, the wheels keep on turning with that game.
4046003	4047103	Proud Mary keep on burning?
4047123	4047663	I don't know.
4048184	4048564	Not yet.
4048664	4049184	Maybe someday.
4049965	4050265	Anyhow.
4050905	4055327	And not to be outdone, from the studio that brings you Hannah Montana...
4057831	4060574	Disney has announced a brand new game for the Wii.
4060594	4062456	Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert.
4062537	4063017	No!
4063738	4065240	It's Ultimate Band.
4065300	4067062	You know, fuck this rock band shit.
4067262	4068904	It's the Ultimate Band.
4069545	4071948	And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS.
4072769	4076534	One thing, though, that you will be happy to know, and maybe this might be...
4077501	4079361	You have one, two, zero, or both You know what?
4104746	4107116	I'm gonna say something pretty daring here.
4107296	4108943	I think this actually isn't a bad idea.
4109830	4111611	Because think about who this game is aimed at.
4111691	4118175	It's aimed at kids, and parents don't want to spend all this freaking money on all these peripherals that their kids are going to destroy.
4118595	4119175	So you know what?
4119235	4127820	If you've got a Wii, why not come out with a game that's very similar to Rock Band, but you don't have to buy all this extra shit for?
4128220	4130001	And of course, I'm not going to like it.
4130061	4132063	Probably Jamie, Matt, they're not going to like it.
4132123	4133243	It's not really made for us.
4133303	4134404	It's a kid's game.
4134484	4138106	I'll try it, but I don't think I'd buy this game, but I'll try it.
4139540	4155547	It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays and the DS version will have that brand new D-Gamer online social network which is sounding pretty awesome and I really kind of want to check it out but that means I have to buy a Disney DS game and I don't know.
4156047	4160449	Actdeft in chat says Sky speaks the truth and GS68 says Sky is right.
4160569	4161409	Ego plus plus.
4163490	4166331	The chat room actually just reminded me of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming week.
4166411	4166772	What's that?
4167072	4167792	Oh, I bought Parappa.
4169788	4172589	for $15 out of Hollywood going out of business.
4174810	4175110	Let's see.
4175190	4179893	RossDLUT says, Sky, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the Flames will disagree.
4180193	4181193	Yeah, well, he's a freak.
4182254	4183835	Hey, did I just call a 7-year-old a freak?
4184195	4184475	Cool.
4184775	4185216	That's fine.
4185236	4185756	He's a freak.
4187397	4191159	Uni in chat says, Kids already nom-nommed the hell out of the Wii Remote.
4191899	4195841	Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii Remote and hid it under the couch.
4197737	4201859	If your seven-year-old nom-noms the Wii Remote and hides it under the couch, you've got issues.
4202219	4203060	I like that phrase.
4203100	4203660	That's funny.
4203720	4204441	What, nom-nom?
4204581	4205221	Nom-nom.
4207122	4207582	Didn't you hear?
4207922	4209163	Everything is Caturday now.
4209263	4209683	Everything.
4210924	4211604	Low-cat speak.
4211944	4212885	Crunky Boy Jr.
4213285	4216487	tries to put out a zinger here saying, You mean we save money on Wii peripherals?
4217127	4217787	Ba-dum-bum.
4218088	4218328	Get it?
4218348	4218748	Because the...
4219580	4221942	They don't really have real Wii peripherals.
4222002	4226045	I mean, after all, there's like, what, the classic controller and the nunchuck?
4226085	4227186	That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii?
4227226	4228527	Everything else is plastic shit.
4232590	4233171	Alright, well...
4234381	4234661	DarkSakura.com
4254239	4255279	Here's how it worked.
4255339	4257320	Jonathan Colton was up on stage with his band.
4257360	4259920	They were playing Still Alive, but in rock band.
4259960	4264841	Apparently, he didn't get 100% on vocals, which is ironically hilarious.
4265021	4265661	They finish.
4265961	4267462	The crowd is cheering.
4268282	4278684	What happens is that this guy from the crowd gets up on stage, walks over to the 360, pulls out a memory card, which I don't know who carries 360 memory cards with them on the go.
4278944	4282745	Back in the day, I used to carry a PlayStation memory card when I'd go to the arcade and stuff.
4282765	4283045	Because
4284746	4290370	I can't think of any reason why you would put a 360 card in your pocket everywhere you go.
4290410	4292471	But whatever, it's Game Developers Conference, whatever.
4292851	4300357	So he pulls out this memory card, he puts it in, messes around, and then finally, one of the Harmonix guys walks over and says, what's going on?
4300417	4302298	And this guy says, I'm just grabbing Still Alive.
4302338	4303639	Everyone needs to be able to play this.
4304119	4306541	Well, the developer took it back and
4307254	4309997	Uh, deleted the thing off the card and, you know, all is well.
4310358	4315784	Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway, because it's probably a dev 360, and I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild.
4315804	4321350	Uh, it wouldn't have worked anyways because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management, which we'll get into later, but...
4322555	4324596	Well, apparently the guy actually wrote about it.
4324636	4333824	The only reason I'm not giving this idiot of the week award or stupid guy of the week or whatever we're calling it here award is because apparently the guy wrote about it in his live journal.
4333884	4334965	And I don't know.
4335265	4337387	Don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate.
4337748	4339649	It could be fanfic or some shit.
4339669	4340029	I don't know.
4340270	4341451	But I think it's legit.
4342251	4343733	You can check it out on his live journal.
4343793	4347676	It's algoromancy.livejournal.com.
4347696	4348697	That's A-L-G-R-O-M-A-N-C-Y.
4349504	4355308	O-R-I-T-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com and he writes in this entry on February 21st, 2008.
4355708	4359330	He writes his side of the story and his thing, he puts a disclaimer at the end.
4359350	4360591	He says, don't try this at home.
4360871	4370176	The only reason I did because I am an acquaintance of Alex who works at Harmonix as well as good friends with several Harmonix folks and game industry friends give each other free swag all the time.
4370236	4373639	Remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material is theft.
4374599	4374659	So.
4374679	4377341	You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?
4377621	4377821	Huh?
4378365	4378685	and DarkSakura.
4406721	4409262	Before we wrap, are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in studio?
4409282	4409522	No.
4410142	4411243	Did you hear our idea?
4411283	4413984	I don't remember if this is the week you were gone, because February was all fucked up.
4414264	4425469	But were you here the week we had the idea that when it comes out, we'll get Mo back, and she'll be our vocalist, and we'll get Matt to play drums, you can play guitar, you and I can work out the guitar somehow, and we'll have an OLR band, and we'll do our rendition.
4425489	4426109	It was mentioned last week.
4426169	4426789	Was it last week?
4427190	4427630	I can't remember.
4427650	4429050	I'm getting old, and the weeks blend together.
4429391	4430131	That's okay, Rob.
4430151	4430391	All right.
4431031	4431932	Anyhow.
4432072	4434092	I'm still bringing you your birthday present.
4434813	4435113	Sweet.
4436533	4441455	Alright, speaking of getting old, the older we get, the more we reminisce about the classic games.
4441495	4445877	And that's why we like to pay tribute to the classic game of the week every week.
4446217	4452240	DarkSakura likes to respect her elders in the gaming world by paying tribute to an old classic game.
4452280	4459503	So let's dust off a dusty game and see what DarkSakura has picked for this week's classic game of the week.
4459543	4459883	What is it?
4460478	4477631	This is actually one of my favorite arcade games ever, and I have it on Saturn, is Cyber Troopers Virtual On, which is a 3D robot fighting game done from a behind-the-view of your own character who you're playing.
4478211	4478972	Let's take a listen.
4489770	4504985	and almost every other sample of it online was horrible so moving forward um you basically play as a virturoid um you know a giant robot controlled by a person which is actually pretty funny because um
4506269	4510117	Their little insert things where the pilots go in the back of the Moon for Saturn.
4510497	4516890	In the sequel, Virtuon, Oretario Tangram was a Dreamcast, which I have that game too, and it's awesome.
4518400	4525886	Um, but you would play as a number of them with different specialties, like you have, um, the Temjin, which is the, the balanced one.
4526647	4535233	Um, you have the Raiden, which is a heavy battle one, really strong and, you know, heavily, uh, armed.
4535253	4542679	Um, you have, uh, the Ampharm, which is, uh, supposed to be, I think, one of the, uh, fast ones.
4542920	4544461	Um, it uses a combo weapon.
4544861	4547183	You have, uh, Belgor, which is, um,
4548551	4564615	Abyssal Launcher, the Dorcus, which is another pretty heavy one, the Viper II, the Fast Balbo, and my favorite, which is the Feiyen, which is like the cute little Loki Mecha, which is really fast and nice.
4564755	4572117	You have the Z-Grat, and then you have the Jaguarati, which is, as far as I remember, I think it was one of the heavy ones.
4572197	4575858	But in the arcade, you had a two-person set-up,
4577020	4579822	And it had a dividing wall in between so you were like in the cockpit.
4580482	4584505	And it used two sticks to control it.
4584705	4587047	And on Saturn they did release the twin sticks.
4588268	4591931	And I actually don't have them which makes me very upset because I had a chance to get them.
4593011	4597755	They did do Oratario Tangram that was on the Dreamcast.
4597775	4599336	I actually do have the twin sticks for that.
4599656	4601197	In fact, you remember your ex-roommate?
4602698	4602898	Yes.
4602998	4603839	We beat him getting them.
4605965	4606465	Interesting.
4606905	4609647	We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento.
4609667	4610387	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
4610407	4611968	We're not talking about the one I live with.
4612328	4613168	Oh, we're talking about that.
4613248	4614109	That roommate.
4614129	4614629	Wow.
4614649	4617290	Those were the days, man.
4617310	4617990	Those were the days.
4618010	4624513	The guy who sold it to us ended up being my husband, ended up being, I do believe, Moe's manager.
4628975	4632837	You know, I know, we're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town.
4634022	4639627	But at any rate, we came in, we saw the twin sticks for 45 bucks, which is astounding at that time.
4640248	4641829	And like, we want to buy these right now.
4641849	4642570	I was like, okay.
4643111	4648796	And then a person who's a, as far as I knew, his nickname came from this game.
4651697	4653578	came in and we beat them by like 10 minutes.
4654038	4655940	So there are also other versions.
4655980	4665668	There was Cybertroopers Virtual on Force that was only in Japanese arcades in 2001 and Virtual on Mars, which was the PS2 release.
4666368	4669871	So there's also an audio drama for it, which is kind of funny.
4671952	4676476	And then there was a musical one, which was the Feiyan Robot Singing Festival.
4677199	4681403	I actually have a Feiyan garage kit that I still have yet to put together that I bought like six years ago.
4682624	4682884	Nice.
4683024	4684826	Virtual On's like tops.
4686027	4686407	All right.
4687008	4687949	Well, that's going to do it.
4687989	4690511	Your classic game of the week, Virtual On.
4691274	4691574	DarkSakura.com
4712805	4713966	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4737376	4739299	What is the guy that created Pong up to now?
4739379	4740200	You might be surprised.
4740540	4745186	So we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4755916	4756937	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4778363	4804400	and as we were taping that right at the very end we were trying to unjumble some of the cords back here and the power cord to the computer got detached and the whole damn thing shut off and although Audition keeps a temporary file on hand when I went in to recover the file I made a mistake and ended up deleting the damn files I was trying to make a backup copy of it and I've tried everything I can't get there's it's not in the recycle bin is pick the chat room's brain on it
4804873	4805534	It's gone.
4805614	4806414	It ain't coming back.
4806814	4807815	So I'm very sorry.
4808255	4810297	Justin, I was thinking March wouldn't be as broken as February.
4811578	4817722	Anyhow, I guess one silver lining to this is that if you do want to hear Part B, it is still archived on the Justin TV channel.
4817762	4820023	So you can go to justin.tv slash orange launch radio.
4820344	4823066	And I believe some of our listeners are trying to make a highlight of the show right now.
4823386	4828029	Now it becomes this big lost archive of the show.
4828069	4829570	It's like a collector's item of sorts.
4830263	4832285	We will try to get an audio rip of that.
4859898	4864300	and a little sad, especially off of a few broken weeks in a row.
4864340	4865101	But what can you do?
4865681	4866422	Life goes on.
4866782	4868203	I hope everybody has a wonderful week.
4868303	4868963	Happy gaming.
4869363	4873986	And we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week with all new power chords in studio.
4874286	4874766	Have a good one.
