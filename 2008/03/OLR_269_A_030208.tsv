7000	10000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura
10000	13000	Sky and Loco
13000	16000	Tonight, March 2, 2008
16000	19000	Metal Gear Solid 4 gets dated and bundled
19000	22000	Mario Kart Wii also gets a date and online texting
22000	27000	And could the game Road Rash be making a comeback?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	43000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
43000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura
48000	49000	Hi
49000	51000	How are you Miss DarkSakura?
51000	54000	I'm well
54000	56000	You're well, that's good
56000	57000	Yes, I'm well
57000	58000	You're well, alright
58000	62000	I'm hoping in a few seconds here you'll be doing really well
62000	64000	I'll explain why momentarily
64000	65000	Okay
65000	67000	But first I have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki
67000	68000	Hello
68000	69000	How are you doing, Loki?
69000	70000	Good
70000	71000	Alright
71000	75000	Sorry I don't have anything extra for you tonight, but you know, that's what happens
75000	78000	I gotta say though, very interesting troubleshooting before the show
78000	83000	We were kind of joking last week on the show that February is the month of Broken here on Orange Lounge Radio
83000	86000	And unfortunately it looked like March was going to turn out the same way
86000	91000	Because for whatever reason we have a wireless network that sits inside the house here where we tape
91000	95000	And for whatever reason just last week when we were doing the short show
95000	98000	It suddenly decided that the strength is not going to be as powerful anymore
98000	105000	And the Justin TV cam would not see, that runs off an iBook that would no longer see the WiFi network
105000	108000	And then tonight Jamie's computer decided it wasn't going to see the network either
108000	110000	So I have no idea what's going on with the box
110000	113000	But very impressed with the technical skills behind
113000	115000	What did we do? We turned your computer
115000	117000	We turned my computer into a gateway
117000	121000	So it's using my wireless internet connection
121000	125000	But I have an ethernet cable and you ran it to the old router
125000	130000	And then you're taking the MacBook and Jamie's and going wireless to that
130000	136000	So it's bouncing wireless to the router to my laptop, wireless to the other router
136000	138000	So right now
138000	139000	We'll do a piggybacking
139000	142000	Jamie's computer in the Justin TV cam which is back this week
142000	143000	Hi guys
143000	146000	Is going through this router
146000	148000	That goes through Loki's computer
148000	150000	That goes through the router in the house which goes to Comcast
150000	151000	And the internet
151000	152000	Yeah
152000	153000	Amazing
153000	156000	This is uber geek tech talk here on Orange Lounge Radio
156000	158000	It's like a wireless orgy
158000	159000	Alright
159000	161000	And now we're going to turn into the Oprah show for a minute
161000	164000	Because we're going to do a giveaway here on the program
164000	165000	I have something for Jamie
165000	167000	And it's actually her birthday present
167000	168000	And it's like six weeks early
168000	169000	What?
169000	171000	Yes I'm giving you your birthday present six weeks early
171000	172000	Because it's something you have to prepare for
172000	173000	Okay
173000	174000	So I'm going to give this to you
174000	178000	Plus I know that you were having a bit of a poopy week
178000	180000	So I think this is a good time for me to give this to you
180000	181000	Okay
181000	182000	So here you go
182000	184000	Open it up and see what they're tickets to
184000	185000	Okay
185000	187000	Alright and hopefully she likes it, I hope
191000	193000	Wow I know they heard this squeak on Justin TV
193000	194000	Yay
194000	197000	Tell the listeners what I got you
197000	200000	Rob got me a ticket to see Margaret Cho
200000	202000	Now in here locally
202000	205000	Now I'd also like to point out, look at where the seats are
205000	207000	Eee
207000	208000	That's like close
208000	209000	That's third row
209000	210000	Probably look up her nose
210000	211000	Third row tickets
211000	213000	So quite excited
213000	214000	Yay
214000	215000	Oh my god where is this?
215000	216000	Davis
216000	217000	Really?
217000	218000	So it's not that far at all
218000	219000	Cool
219000	220000	There we have it
220000	221000	So mark that date on your calendar
221000	223000	It's May something something
223000	224000	I'm doing that right now
224000	225000	Alright
225000	227000	Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy
227000	228000	There you go
228000	230000	So I thought that would help after a poopy week
230000	233000	And my worst fear was that you were going to plan something else
233000	235000	So like I knew I had to tell you
235000	237000	Or get tickets independently somehow
237000	238000	I didn't even know
238000	240000	I didn't either, I got an email about it
240000	242000	So there you go
242000	244000	And I know Jamie loves some Margaret Cho and I do too
244000	245000	She's pretty funny
245000	248000	Hopefully she's not quite so political
248000	250000	I liked it better when she was dicking fart jokes
250000	251000	But you know
251000	253000	She's still somebody I like
253000	255000	Yes me and you
255000	256000	Cool
256000	257000	Alright
257000	258000	There should be two there
258000	259000	I was like
259000	260000	Okay
260000	261000	I thought so because I was like
261000	262000	Why
262000	263000	Okay
263000	265000	No you have to take me I'm sorry
265000	266000	Of course
266000	267000	Of course
267000	268000	No this is so cool
268000	269000	Thank you Rob
269000	270000	Alright you're welcome
270000	273000	Now we can get to talking about video games yes?
273000	274000	Yeah
274000	275000	Alright
275000	276000	So we're done with Tech Talk
276000	277000	We're done with Oprah
277000	278000	Now let's talk
278000	280000	Let's talk video games
280000	281000	How was your gaming week
281000	282000	Dark Sakura?
282000	285000	My gaming week was
285000	289000	Well it was interesting
289000	293000	Because I almost put in Kingdom Hearts 2
293000	294000	I picked it up
294000	296000	And then I had other stuff to do
296000	298000	Because I watched Tron earlier in the week
298000	299000	I was like
299000	301000	I love Tron I want to play Kingdom Hearts
301000	303000	Because of the whole Space Paranoids level
303000	307000	And there was a lot of burnout
307000	310000	And I watched Dan play a lot of burnout
310000	314000	And I played a lot of Ragnarok
314000	317000	That was it
317000	319000	Alright
319000	321000	Well Loki how was your gaming week?
321000	322000	My gaming week was okay
322000	324000	I played
324000	327000	I actually picked up Pop Tippon
327000	329000	And I've been playing quite a bit of that
329000	331000	In fact that's what I was playing before the show
331000	332000	It's fun
332000	333000	It's different
333000	334000	I like it
334000	335000	I don't know
335000	336000	It's very easy to play
336000	337000	But I guess
337000	340000	It takes some time to build up your armies and stuff
340000	342000	Then I played
342000	344000	And I actually purchased N Plus
344000	346000	On Xbox Live Arcade
346000	348000	And that game is just as fun as the original N
348000	351000	So thoroughly enjoying that
351000	354000	And
354000	356000	I actually played a little bit of Frogger this week
356000	359000	Because we were having this party
359000	361000	We have at the end of every month for our work
361000	363000	And this one happened to be leap year themed
363000	365000	And so they wanted Frogger
365000	367000	And they used my system to play Frogger
367000	369000	So I got to play some of that
369000	371000	Because no one else was touching it
371000	373000	And then
373000	376000	I've been playing a lot of Lost Odyssey
376000	378000	So that's actually pretty cool
378000	380000	I finally got to the point in the game
380000	382000	Where one of the characters dies
382000	384000	Not necessarily a main character
384000	387000	But I was just very surprised
387000	389000	On how everyone makes that argument
389000	391000	Of video games being art and stuff
391000	392000	Well
392000	394000	Shit I think there's a perfect example right there
394000	396000	Of how powerful they can make the story
396000	398000	And it was pretty cool
398000	400000	So
400000	403000	I'm about 11 hours into it now
403000	405000	Still on the first disc though
405000	407000	And just taking my time through that
407000	409000	And
409000	411000	Pretty much that's it I guess
411000	413000	Other than the usual Saints Row
413000	415000	But
415000	418000	No one wants to hear about that
418000	420000	For the five billionth time?
420000	422000	Yeah
422000	424000	Well let's see
424000	426000	In my gaming week I also played Lost Odyssey
426000	428000	And I had much the same experience as you did
428000	430000	I got to the second disc
430000	432000	Which means you kind of go through
432000	434000	Some big plot twists in the first event
434000	436000	Or first disc let's put it that way
436000	438000	And I'm amazed by the game
438000	440000	And I'm still amazed that the game is getting as much flak
440000	442000	As it has been
442000	444000	Although you know I do understand
444000	446000	Some of the little complaints about the game
446000	448000	And even one of them I find to be kind of annoying
448000	450000	And that is lack of save points
450000	452000	One of the things that has been bugging me
452000	454000	Is that sometimes I'll be forced to sit there for an hour
454000	456000	While the next part of the game loads
456000	458000	Or whatever
458000	460000	I mean it just takes forever
460000	462000	It's crazy
462000	464000	To get to the next save point
464000	466000	While you watch through all these cut scenes
466000	468000	I mean it's not like it's bad
468000	470000	It's not like you're bored or anything
470000	472000	Or you're just getting antsy
472000	474000	Because there's lots to do
474000	476000	But sometimes I only want to play in little 30 minute chunks
476000	478000	And so I'm kind of stuck there for an hour
478000	480000	It auto saves too for some things
480000	482000	Some things
482000	484000	But not a lot
484000	486000	I haven't had that problem with
486000	488000	Save points
488000	490000	What do you think about the difficulty of the game?
490000	492000	It's not that difficult
492000	494000	Some of the first
494000	496000	Some of the boss battles
496000	498000	Were surprisingly tough
498000	500000	If you grind some of the way through there
500000	502000	Because a lot of this game
502000	504000	Seems like it's very quick
504000	506000	There's certain areas in the game
506000	508000	Where there's like 2 or 3 sections of the map
508000	510000	And then that's it
510000	512000	And then you're on to the next section of the world
512000	514000	Or whatever
514000	516000	It's very small
516000	518000	But I don't know
518000	520000	It wasn't that difficult
520000	522000	You just grind a little bit
522000	524000	And get your characters leveled up
524000	526000	And it's pretty easy
526000	528000	Also I have the preorder bonus
528000	530000	So I have an item that gives me
530000	532000	A level 2 guard or whatever
532000	534000	So I can block most of the shots
534000	536000	Nice, I don't have that
536000	538000	That was something you got for preorder, huh?
538000	540000	Hopefully they release that as a download thing later
540000	542000	It will probably come later on
542000	544000	Let's go over to the chat room
544000	546000	The chat room has their own comments
546000	548000	rostelut says
548000	550000	It only sucks when you die an hour without a save
550000	552000	Kind of true, but there's also some things
552000	554000	Where you go through cutscene, cutscene, cutscene
554000	556000	And then you have to fight a big boss battle
556000	558000	I know you can skip cutscenes
558000	560000	But even then
560000	562000	Sometimes you have to sit there
562000	564000	And hit the game engine
564000	566000	So you have to kind of sit there and press A-A-A-A-A
566000	568000	You can also pause it
568000	570000	And hit the back button
570000	572000	For the cutscenes, but what about the ones
572000	574000	Where they're actually talking to each other
574000	576000	With the dialogue boxes, you have to A-A-A
576000	578000	I don't know
578000	580000	It doesn't matter
580000	582000	It's honestly just a tiny little blemish
582000	584000	In what is otherwise a magnificent game
584000	586000	That deserves to be getting more attention than it is
586000	588000	As far as other games I've been playing this week
588000	590000	I've been playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl
590000	592000	Because
592000	594000	I was
594000	596000	Loki was kind enough to loan me his Japanese copy
596000	598000	And the Wii to play it on
598000	600000	So I was checking that out a little bit this week
600000	602000	Didn't understand what I was doing, but I was having fun
602000	604000	Playing just the massive
604000	606000	Free-for-all mode
606000	608000	So that was pretty cool
608000	610000	Obviously, last week I was sick
610000	612000	On the show, and I'm happy to report I'm better
612000	614000	I did have a sinus infection, so I had to go to a doctor
614000	616000	And antibiotics and blah blah blah
616000	618000	But Loki lent me that as kind of a get better soon type thing
618000	620000	Which was very nice
620000	622000	I did end up playing Lost Odyssey most of the time
622000	624000	I didn't actually hook that thing up till like Friday
624000	626000	That's exactly why I loaded tickets
626000	628000	This is exactly what I'm doing
628000	630000	I'm not playing Smash Bros.
630000	632000	Well, even before Smash Bros. Brawl
632000	634000	I never played Melee very much
634000	636000	Maybe once at a friend's house
636000	638000	The first Smash Bros. Brawl I didn't even touch
638000	640000	So
640000	642000	I don't know
642000	644000	It's not really my type of game
644000	646000	It's fun
646000	648000	You know
648000	650000	I may pick up the US one
650000	652000	I haven't decided yet if I want to do that or not
652000	654000	Gerardimo in chat says
654000	656000	Rob, do you think Brawl lives up to the hype
656000	658000	Even if it's not in English
658000	660000	Kind of, it's hard to tell
660000	662000	I don't feel right giving a fair review
662000	664000	On a Japanese game when I don't understand how to get into
664000	666000	Some of the modes and look at the extra stuff
666000	668000	It does, yeah
668000	670000	Loki has no problem answering that
670000	672000	The parts I've seen so far
672000	674000	Feel like Smash Bros. Melee
674000	676000	1.5 a little bit
676000	678000	Because it's like the same kind of engine
678000	680000	The same stuff with just some new characters
680000	682000	But I realize that's not being totally fair
682000	684000	In saying that because I haven't looked at everything
684000	686000	Outside of just the brawling
686000	688000	But it does seem like, you know, there's a lot of the stuff
688000	690000	They just copied right on over from the GameCube version
690000	692000	So
692000	694000	Very interesting
694000	696000	Frisbee says Halo 3 feels like
696000	698000	Halo 2.5
698000	700000	It's a little bit that
700000	702000	I don't know how to say it
702000	704000	So that was my gaming week
704000	706000	So if that's everybody's gaming week
706000	708000	Then we will move on to talking about some news
708000	710000	But for some housekeeping
710000	712000	Of which we have nothing special of note
712000	714000	What's that?
714000	716000	What's that? I forget
716000	718000	The award contest thing that's going on through all games
718000	720000	That's like three months old
720000	722000	I can't believe you just saw that
722000	724000	I did just see that
724000	726000	Hey, I don't read, you know
726000	728000	I unfortunately don't read their website
728000	730000	Or their forums
730000	732000	You're just too busy
732000	734000	Doing other things
734000	736000	I will give it a mention on air
736000	738000	I don't even know if it's still going on
738000	740000	I think it's kind of funny that Loki took so long to find it
740000	742000	I posted a link on the forums
742000	744000	Let me see
744000	746000	December 27th
746000	748000	I didn't even notice it
748000	750000	All games
750000	752000	Which our show runs on
752000	754000	We syndicate on their network
754000	756000	They play us Monday nights
756000	758000	And I want to say
758000	760000	And then Tuesday mornings
760000	762000	At 9am
762000	764000	No, because they do their regular
764000	766000	All games show at 10 now
766000	768000	So I don't even know what time we run Tuesday mornings
768000	770000	But I know our show is syndicated on their network
770000	772000	Mondays and Tuesdays, supposedly
772000	774000	And we were nominated for Awards Are Hard
774000	776000	As a best affiliate podcast
776000	778000	And it's all going on in their forums
778000	780000	The voting
780000	782000	I would think it's already over
782000	784000	Three months ago
784000	786000	But then again, the topics are still up
786000	788000	Who knows, maybe it's an ongoing thing
788000	790000	From yesterday to today
790000	792000	They've put the votes
792000	794000	As anonymous so you can't see
794000	796000	What each podcast has
796000	798000	Yesterday it didn't have it that way
798000	800000	And Tigerclaw says, Sky, they still haven't announced
800000	802000	The winners, so I guess it is ongoing
802000	804000	For three months now
804000	806000	And Tigerclaw, I know listens to all games
806000	808000	Every other day
808000	810000	I don't know
810000	812000	I voted for us
812000	814000	Well, I appreciate the support
814000	816000	I guess, for yourself
816000	818000	I mentioned that I was going to vote for Bobby
818000	820000	But he bought a knife judgment
820000	822000	And I can't support that kind of behavior
822000	824000	That's most unfortunate
824000	826000	He also dropped out of the race
826000	828000	As of like yesterday
828000	830000	Didn't want to play that game
830000	832000	Alright, well if you want to throw us a vote
832000	834000	It's over on forums.allgames.com
834000	836000	I will plug the other stuff I know we always got
836000	838000	We have our live general community at Orange Lounge
838000	840000	Our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio
840000	842000	And our Facebook is the OLR
842000	844000	You can look us up on our social networking sites
844000	846000	Meet other OLR listeners
846000	848000	Look at our posts and clips of the show
848000	850000	We have on some of those places like MySpace
850000	852000	Tons of fun
852000	854000	Alright, let's get into the gaming news
854000	856000	Loki, take it away
856000	858000	Ok, so there was a lot of stuff coming out this week
858000	860000	From Destination and Playstation
860000	862000	It's the retail only conference thing
862000	864000	Or whatever
864000	866000	I couldn't go, but other people from my company did
866000	868000	Bastards
868000	870000	And of course, you know, some of the news that leaked out
870000	872000	Metal Gear Solid 4 has a date finally
872000	874000	It's officially coming to the US
874000	876000	On June 12th
876000	878000	And that of course
878000	880000	Not only was leaked out
880000	882000	But confirmed by Konami
882000	884000	And they also said that if you reserve your copy
884000	886000	Of Metal Gear Solid 4
886000	888000	Starting April 2008
888000	890000	You get Metal Gear Saga 2.0
890000	892000	A DVD to catch you up on
892000	894000	All the stuff that's going on in the series
894000	896000	As well as
896000	898000	A beta code for
898000	900000	Metal Gear Online
900000	902000	And then to coincide with that
902000	904000	And this
904000	906000	I don't know if this is going to be the official
906000	908000	You know, remember because the 80GB
908000	910000	Skew for the PS3 was being phased out
910000	912000	Well, there's a new 80GB Skew now
912000	914000	Same price, but you get
914000	916000	Metal Gear Solid 4 and a DualShock 3
916000	918000	Controller, all for $499
918000	920000	Which is not a bad deal at all
920000	922000	If you don't have a PS3
922000	924000	Because I know a lot of people would be buying a PS3 for that
924000	926000	And it's nice that they're actually throwing in
926000	928000	The DualShock 3 instead of making you buy that
928000	930000	Separately
930000	932000	No word on when that's coming out
932000	934000	But it's supposed to come out around the same time as
934000	936000	Metal Gear Solid 4, obviously
936000	938000	So, June 12th and on
938000	940000	I guess
940000	942000	Alright
942000	944000	Well, moving on to
944000	946000	Other gaming news
946000	948000	Although it still has to do with Metal Gear Solid 4
948000	950000	Actually, let me
950000	952000	Back up for just a minute
952000	954000	Loki, how important
954000	956000	Is this news to Playstation
956000	958000	Fans, you think?
958000	960000	I think it's very important
960000	962000	I think this is going to sell a lot more systems than
962000	964000	The year old MotorStorm
964000	966000	They needed to update that bundle
966000	968000	Anyways, because
968000	970000	Shit, that game is old now
970000	972000	And I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is the perfect game
972000	974000	To throw in there, especially now that
974000	976000	I'm assuming the new bundles are going to start coming with
976000	978000	The DualShock 3 controllers
978000	980000	Probably not the 40GB for right now
980000	982000	Because there's a
982000	984000	The one right now doesn't have it
984000	986000	And I don't know if they're going to announce a new one
986000	988000	Anytime soon
988000	990000	It's important
990000	992000	I think this game is actually one of the first
992000	994000	Major games for the PS3
994000	996000	That you can only get on the PS3
996000	998000	And that's
998000	1000000	A little bit of fuel to Sony's Fire
1000000	1002000	Although this is the first of hopefully many
1002000	1004000	But
1004000	1006000	Hopefully it does very well
1006000	1008000	Let's say Metal Gear Solid 4
1008000	1010000	Does not sell
1010000	1012000	All that, I mean let's say
1012000	1014000	Obviously the game is going to sell fine
1014000	1016000	At least mediocre
1016000	1018000	But let's say the game does not sell super duper well
1018000	1020000	And doesn't move all these new bundles
1020000	1022000	Is that going to be really bad for Sony?
1022000	1024000	Or will they get more chances?
1024000	1026000	They may have more chances, but a lot of the stuff
1026000	1028000	That they're counting on is way later on
1028000	1030000	Killzone 2 will be another one that moves
1030000	1032000	Systems, Resistance, Fall of Man 2
1032000	1034000	Maybe MotorStorm 2
1034000	1036000	And then
1036000	1038000	Final Fantasy 13, that's so far off
1038000	1040000	That I wouldn't even
1040000	1042000	Consider that anything to wait for
1042000	1044000	Right now for the PS3
1044000	1046000	If you're going to wait that long, you might as well just wait for the PlayStation 4
1046000	1048000	But
1048000	1050000	At the same time
1050000	1052000	I don't know
1052000	1054000	It should do very well
1054000	1056000	But once again, you know, they're also hoping
1056000	1058000	Blu-ray is going to sell these systems
1058000	1060000	You know, it's a lot of hopes and dreams
1060000	1062000	But we'll actually have to see what happens
1062000	1064000	I mean, it'll be a very interesting spring
1064000	1066000	My parents got a Blu-ray
1066000	1068000	Player, which kind of surprised me
1068000	1070000	Because they're not usually on the cutting edge
1070000	1072000	Of all the technological gadgets
1072000	1074000	And I was playing with their Blu-ray player a little bit
1074000	1076000	And it was slow
1076000	1078000	It was so slow
1078000	1080000	And I'm sorry, I know sometimes we get the mail
1080000	1082000	Like, you guys always pick on Sony, we hate Sony
1082000	1084000	Because, you know, if we hated Sony
1084000	1086000	We would so have a PSP-oriented website
1086000	1088000	But anyway, it's beside the point
1088000	1090000	But seriously, it was slow
1090000	1092000	And clunky, it reminded me
1092000	1094000	It's just first generation stuff
1094000	1096000	Well, the first DVD player we ever had
1096000	1098000	Was kind of slow and clunky, too
1098000	1100000	I remember when I had a single-speed CD-ROM drive
1100000	1102000	Now that's slow shit right there
1102000	1104000	Well, Rob, you know what?
1104000	1106000	What?
1106000	1108000	I think it's funny that you mentioned them getting a Blu-ray player
1108000	1110000	Why?
1110000	1112000	We got an HD DVD player
1112000	1114000	Did you? Did you get the one for the Xbox?
1114000	1116000	Yes, we did, 50 bucks
1116000	1118000	Oh yeah, because they're so cheap now
1118000	1120000	Yep
1120000	1122000	Do you think you'll get enough library of movies to go with it?
1122000	1124000	Well, I don't care what else Dan gets
1124000	1126000	You know, he picked up a couple of movies
1126000	1128000	But I don't really care because that's all I'm getting
1128000	1130000	There you go, nice
1130000	1132000	Alright, well, obviously, Metal Gear Solid
1132000	1134000	Is one thing many PlayStation 3 fans are looking forward to
1134000	1136000	But there's also Metal Gear Online
1136000	1138000	And we already talked about in a previous show
1138000	1140000	The Metal Gear Online Starter Pack
1140000	1142000	That's supposed to be going out with Metal Gear Solid 4
1142000	1144000	Well, they're going to be beta testing
1144000	1146000	Metal Gear Online in late April
1146000	1148000	But here's the deal
1148000	1150000	If you pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4
1150000	1152000	You will get
1152000	1154000	Guaranteed access
1154000	1156000	To this limited beta
1156000	1158000	It's a little bit reminiscent
1158000	1160000	It seems to me like the crackdown Halo 3 thing
1160000	1162000	I think
1162000	1164000	There you go, but I'm sure
1164000	1166000	Most people that would be into Metal Gear Online
1166000	1168000	Are already going to pick up Metal Gear Solid 4
1168000	1170000	This is just incentive, I guess, to get pre-orders out there
1170000	1172000	Which makes sense to me
1172000	1174000	That Sony would want that because they're going to want
1174000	1176000	Strong numbers out the gate as much as possible
1176000	1178000	To try and put next to
1178000	1180000	Halo 3
1180000	1182000	And what I'm assuming
1182000	1184000	Will probably be Smash Brothers numbers
1184000	1186000	And so on and so on
1186000	1188000	It's kind of like their day one big seller
1188000	1190000	It's going to be the number one game for the console
1190000	1192000	It's just
1192000	1194000	Halo 3 may have
1194000	1196000	Been the number one game
1196000	1198000	For the Xbox 360
1198000	1200000	But I don't think it sold that many systems
1200000	1202000	I'm sure there's people that waited to buy
1202000	1204000	A system for Halo 3
1204000	1206000	I don't know
1206000	1208000	I believe a lot of systems got sold because of that game
1208000	1210000	Metal Gear Solid 4 might push a lot of systems
1210000	1212000	But then again, their system is still more expensive
1212000	1214000	And
1214000	1216000	It's a little easier now to make that purchase
1216000	1218000	Now that we know that
1218000	1220000	Blu-ray is going to be the high-def format
1220000	1222000	Of choice
1222000	1224000	Metal Gear Solid 4 does have a definite date now
1224000	1226000	And we know when it's coming
1226000	1228000	Plus now you have
1228000	1230000	Grand Theft Auto 4 as well
1230000	1232000	There's going to be a lot of stuff to play on there
1232000	1234000	But
1234000	1236000	They can't just rely on these
1236000	1238000	Couple games to push the sales
1238000	1240000	They really need to put out a strong library of games
1240000	1242000	And they have a lot of catching up to do
1242000	1244000	Alright, well
1244000	1246000	For you Metal Gear Solid fans
1246000	1248000	You might want to go pre-order the game if you want to check out the
1248000	1250000	Online beta
1250000	1252000	If you don't already have it pre-ordered
1252000	1254000	Which I'm sure many of you do
1254000	1256000	Well, there had been
1256000	1258000	Talk that Metal Gear Solid was going to be ported
1258000	1260000	To Playstation 2
1260000	1262000	That's actually not happening
1262000	1264000	The Metal Gear
1264000	1266000	Metal Gear Solid essential collection
1266000	1268000	Is going to be on two DVDs
1268000	1270000	It's supposed to be out
1270000	1272000	On March 18th
1272000	1274000	For $29.99
1274000	1276000	Over here in the US
1276000	1278000	It's going to be a Playstation 1 game
1278000	1280000	That's awesome
1280000	1282000	Well, I mean, there would be no point to really remake
1282000	1284000	You know
1284000	1286000	Metal Gear Solid for Playstation 2
1286000	1288000	Maybe there were people that were hoping that
1288000	1290000	Some of the, cause you know there was the GameCube one
1290000	1292000	Didn't the GameCube one have some extra frills
1292000	1294000	When it came out?
1294000	1296000	I think so
1296000	1298000	Maybe people were hoping some of those extra frills would come over
1298000	1300000	I'm surprised that they didn't put
1300000	1302000	Metal Gear Solid 1
1302000	1304000	And then also have like VR
1304000	1306000	Missions as well
1306000	1308000	Well, my theory is that they are going to
1308000	1310000	This is again just my theory
1310000	1312000	Because really
1312000	1314000	The VR Missions was part of Metal Gear Solid
1314000	1316000	Integral
1316000	1318000	Which was basically Metal Gear Solid
1318000	1320000	All you need to do is put in the camera control
1320000	1322000	And you can play it that way
1322000	1324000	So they could easily
1324000	1326000	Include the VR Missions and the
1326000	1328000	I guess integral mode
1328000	1330000	Hmm
1330000	1332000	Well, it's neat
1332000	1334000	I mean, I guess it's not too, I mean
1334000	1336000	If this Playstation is backwards compatible
1336000	1338000	And all that, you know, at least what little
1338000	1340000	Backwards compatibility some of them have
1340000	1342000	It's not surprising that they only need to kind of put it out there
1342000	1344000	On Playstation 1 format
1344000	1346000	Exactly, and if I remember correctly
1346000	1348000	There's collections coming out
1348000	1350000	In a couple weeks
1350000	1352000	Should be able to pick it up soon
1352000	1354000	And it's cheap, 30 bucks
1354000	1356000	Very cool
1356000	1358000	A really cool
1358000	1360000	Well, you know, not cool for me because I already own
1360000	1362000	A couple PSPs, but for someone that may not own
1362000	1364000	A PSP yet, you can get a brand new
1364000	1366000	PSP Slim that happens to be red
1366000	1368000	With a giant head of Kratos
1368000	1370000	Silkscreen on the back
1370000	1372000	This will actually be replacing
1372000	1374000	The Star Wars
1374000	1376000	The same bundle that they've had for a while
1376000	1378000	You can no longer get those, unfortunately
1378000	1380000	And of course, it will be coming out
1380000	1382000	I believe
1382000	1384000	Next week with the brand new game
1384000	1386000	Of course, God of War Chains of Olympus
1386000	1388000	And some other cool stuff that will come
1388000	1390000	With this entertainment pack
1390000	1392000	It will come with a copy of
1392000	1394000	The Superbad UMD
1394000	1396000	As well as a voucher to download
1396000	1398000	Syphon Filter Combat Ops
1398000	1400000	From the PC Playstation Store
1400000	1402000	Now here's
1402000	1404000	My only little problem with this whole thing
1404000	1406000	Usually these entertainment packs come with
1406000	1408000	A 1GB memory stick
1408000	1410000	I have heard no mention of a 1GB memory
1410000	1412000	Stick with this, so
1412000	1414000	Yay, I can download a game to nothing
1414000	1416000	You have to buy a memory stick separately
1416000	1418000	Way to go, awesome
1418000	1420000	This might be a bad idea
1420000	1422000	But do you think we're just supposed to assume
1422000	1424000	It's there anyway?
1424000	1426000	I don't think it is, because they would have mentioned it
1426000	1428000	It would have been a selling point, but
1428000	1430000	You know, hey, surprise me
1430000	1432000	Maybe it is in there, but
1432000	1434000	I'm just going to take a while to guess
1434000	1436000	And seeing as they didn't mention it
1436000	1438000	And I don't think it was in the press release
1438000	1440000	Although I will double check in just a second here
1440000	1442000	I'm pretty sure it does not
1442000	1444000	Come with a memory stick, which is kind of sad
1444000	1446000	Now, Alpha Canagram in chat says
1446000	1448000	Loki, bigger sizes are dirt cheap
1448000	1450000	1GB is useless
1450000	1452000	That's fine, okay, but the fact is
1452000	1454000	It's still stupid to offer
1454000	1456000	A free downloadable game
1456000	1458000	A voucher or whatever
1458000	1460000	It's worth, I guess, 10 bucks
1460000	1462000	When you don't have anything to store it to
1462000	1464000	Well, here's my thought
1464000	1466000	What about the fact that
1466000	1468000	My roommate was hooking up a new printer today
1468000	1470000	And it didn't come with a USB cable
1470000	1472000	To hook it up to the computer
1472000	1474000	So it's kind of that same logic to me
1474000	1476000	Battery's not included, except now it's other things
1476000	1478000	Memory not included
1478000	1480000	I understand, buying a game console
1480000	1482000	Back in the day, it didn't come with a memory card
1482000	1484000	You had to buy a memory card
1484000	1486000	To save your games and stuff
1486000	1488000	It's completely optional
1488000	1490000	But, I mean, come on
1490000	1492000	Got a War Chains of Olympus
1492000	1494000	You're going to need a memory stick
1494000	1496000	It's just kind of annoying that you get it all home
1496000	1498000	Or something, you get it for Easter
1498000	1500000	Or something like that
1500000	1502000	It's like, yeah, I'm ready to play this game
1502000	1504000	Aw shit, I gotta go drive back down to the store
1504000	1506000	To pick up a memory stick
1506000	1508000	I don't know, I think it's still kind of cheap
1508000	1510000	But whatever
1510000	1512000	If that's kind of your thing
1512000	1514000	Then go ahead and purchase it
1514000	1516000	And it'll probably be limited
1516000	1518000	Since the last one was too
1518000	1520000	Although I think most people
1520000	1522000	That are all crazy about God of War
1522000	1524000	Most of them probably already have a PSP, don't you think?
1524000	1526000	That's always what amazes me about these bundles
1526000	1528000	That come out so much later
1528000	1530000	But, oh yeah, this is also coming out in June-ish
1530000	1532000	I mean, around that time frame
1532000	1534000	So it's going to be three months after
1534000	1536000	The game actually comes out
1536000	1538000	I don't know, it's cool I guess
1538000	1540000	If you don't have one yet
1540000	1542000	You might think about picking this up
1542000	1544000	To be honest, the only reason I picked up
1544000	1546000	My Daxter bundle was because it was the only thing
1546000	1548000	Available at the time, so
1548000	1550000	It wasn't like I really wanted to play Daxter
1550000	1552000	Another comment from chat
1552000	1554000	From Ake Ripper, I think that is
1554000	1556000	A-K-E Ripper
1556000	1558000	It's chat.orangelandstranger.com
1558000	1560000	Says, still, one gigabyte, you don't get far
1560000	1562000	You know what?
1562000	1564000	I'm using my 16 memory
1564000	1566000	16 megabyte memory stick
1566000	1568000	That came with my original PSP
1568000	1570000	Or 32 or whatever it is
1570000	1572000	The original one from the first PSP bundle
1572000	1574000	Hey, you know what? That's fine
1574000	1576000	That's the thing right now
1576000	1578000	Say you can't
1578000	1580000	Just throw in a 32 meg one
1580000	1582000	Yeah, I know it sucks and you can buy a bigger one later
1582000	1584000	But hey, you know what? At least it will get you through
1584000	1586000	Being able to save your game
1586000	1588000	Of God of War so you can start playing it right out of the box
1588000	1590000	And I'm sure since those
1590000	1592000	1 gigabyte memory sticks are, what, 30 bucks now
1592000	1594000	The 32 megabyte one should be like 50 cents
1594000	1596000	If that
1596000	1598000	I mean, so come on
1598000	1600000	Just dump that shit
1600000	1602000	Hey, I'm not alone
1602000	1604000	We have another chat.orangelandstranger.com
1604000	1606000	And I cannot pronounce this name for the life of me
1606000	1608000	It's T-V-V-I-C-H-M-A-N
1608000	1610000	Tovitchman? I don't know
1610000	1612000	Says, I still use my 32, so I'm not alone
1612000	1614000	So, there you have it
1614000	1616000	Well, you know
1616000	1618000	A lot of people are very excited about home
1618000	1620000	Even though it keeps kind of getting pushed back
1620000	1622000	And pushed back, but you know what they say
1622000	1624000	As long as there's reason and purpose
1624000	1626000	Behind pushing it back
1626000	1628000	Because it isn't all necessarily a bad thing
1628000	1630000	Apparently
1630000	1632000	Some big Sony games are going to be
1632000	1634000	Integrated in home, and those games are
1634000	1636000	Warhawk, Uncharted, Drakes, Fortune, and Resistance
1636000	1638000	Follow Man, and assumably
1638000	1640000	These are just three to start, and you know, obviously
1640000	1642000	More would follow
1642000	1644000	I imagine other big titles, even from third party publishers
1644000	1646000	Would be included here too
1646000	1648000	Warhawk is going to let eight people
1648000	1650000	Meet in like a war room area
1650000	1652000	Prior to a match
1652000	1654000	And you can make out your strategies on a sand table
1654000	1656000	That's like a replica of the different levels in the game
1656000	1658000	And then you go right from there
1658000	1660000	Into your match
1660000	1662000	So, kind of cute
1662000	1664000	And then Resistance and Uncharted
1664000	1666000	Basically, your avatars can go into levels
1666000	1668000	From those games
1668000	1670000	And that would allow you to get to parts of the game
1670000	1672000	That are even completely unseen
1672000	1674000	In addition to that, Uncharted is supposed to have
1674000	1676000	A 2D shooter game that's built into it
1676000	1678000	That launches from home
1678000	1680000	So that's some cool ideas
1680000	1682000	That sounds fairly generous
1682000	1684000	But, you know
1684000	1686000	I imagine the shooter is cheesy
1686000	1688000	But it's better than nothing
1688000	1690000	And it's probably one of those cool little integrations
1690000	1692000	The news about home
1692000	1694000	Is very exciting
1694000	1696000	And it makes me wish it would have been out a lot sooner
1696000	1698000	But, you know, okay
1698000	1700000	If the delays are making it better, then it's hard to complain
1700000	1702000	It's all part of their plan to hopefully get more momentum
1702000	1704000	I mean, this is also stuff that they can say
1704000	1706000	Look, here, Live does not have this
1706000	1708000	This is why you should buy a PS3
1708000	1710000	They're giving us reasons now
1710000	1712000	They're selling a system
1712000	1714000	Which is what they should have been doing since the beginning
1714000	1716000	Frisbee in chat says
1716000	1718000	Push it back until no one cares, am I right?
1718000	1720000	I don't know, but the more they drop little tidbits like this
1720000	1722000	It's hard to ignore
1722000	1724000	Yeah, but at the same time, though
1724000	1726000	It's like, you know, Duke Nukem Forever
1726000	1728000	Come on, dude
1728000	1730000	I would like to see a little more video of this stuff in action
1730000	1732000	Not just screenshots
1732000	1734000	You know, just because
1734000	1736000	Video helps you get so much more of a sense
1736000	1738000	Of what it really looks like than pictures
1738000	1740000	I mean, the trophy room thing
1740000	1742000	It's kind of neat, I guess
1742000	1744000	But at the same time, I'm just like, whatever
1744000	1746000	Like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's trophy room
1746000	1748000	And see a stupid dragon from Lair
1748000	1750000	I'd be like, wow
1750000	1752000	Testament that you played Lair
1752000	1754000	Man, you suck
1754000	1756000	Well, you know what, though, Xbox is the same thing with the achievements
1756000	1758000	You know, you get certain achievements
1758000	1760000	Well, it's like, I wouldn't want to walk through someone's room
1760000	1762000	Of, like, achievements that they've earned during, like, you know, Totem Ball
1762000	1764000	Or some shit
1764000	1766000	This is where I played the game for ten hours or something
1766000	1768000	Wow, you have dedication
1768000	1770000	You press start
1770000	1772000	Achievement unlocked
1772000	1774000	Wasn't that one in the Simpsons game?
1774000	1776000	Or Avatar
1776000	1778000	You hit something eight times in a row
1778000	1780000	One thousand points unlocked
1780000	1782000	There you have it
1782000	1784000	I don't know, Jamie, are you excited about home on PlayStation 3?
1784000	1786000	Relatively
1786000	1788000	I'm excited because it's free
1788000	1790000	If I had to pay for that shit, I'm not playing in home
1790000	1792000	Free is a good thing
1792000	1794000	Free is a very good thing, it's hard to ignore
1794000	1796000	Oh, that is a good point
1796000	1798000	Touche for Jamie
1798000	1800000	Speaking of achievements you don't like to have on your record
1804000	1808000	Well, there actually is a date now for Dual Shock 3
1808000	1810000	Over here in the US
1810000	1812000	We're getting it on April 15th
1812000	1814000	For $54.99
1814000	1816000	And I don't want that for my birthday
1816000	1818000	So nobody get it for me
1818000	1820000	But it's, I mean
1820000	1822000	It's basically
1822000	1827000	Basically, from what I can tell in here, the 6-axis with vibration, so...
1828000	1832000	So basically it's the controller that should have come out the first time, it's finally coming out.
1832000	1835000	Yeah, except for all the crappy legal problems they were having.
1835000	1837000	Wait, what was the price again on that?
1837000	1839000	That's $54.99.
1839000	1845000	$54 bucks for a freaking controller. But then again, Xbox is just as bad, right? Isn't it like $59 for their wireless?
1845000	1846000	$49.
1846000	1850000	It's the same price as their current controllers. You see, he rumbles $5 extra.
1850000	1852000	I guess...
1852000	1854000	That is too damn much for a controller.
1854000	1858000	Wait, no, I actually rumble, well, tilt sensors in rumble are, you know, $5 extra.
1858000	1860000	Well, it is also wireless.
1860000	1862000	But still...
1862000	1865000	Yeah, the wireless controller, I don't know, it's a...
1865000	1869000	I don't give Xbox a pass here either, I think their controllers are way too expensive too, I think.
1869000	1871000	And then you get the Wii one, it's just as bad too.
1871000	1872000	Yeah, the Wii's bad.
1872000	1873000	Controllers are way too damn much money.
1873000	1878000	Yeah, yeah, but I have to say something though for the Xbox 360 controllers, that the keyboard attachment is cool.
1878000	1879000	Really?
1879000	1880000	Oh yeah.
1880000	1881000	I haven't even really played with one ever.
1881000	1889000	The Wii is actually more expensive if you consider the remote and nunchuck, because the remote's $40 and the nunchuck's $20, so it's $60 altogether.
1889000	1896000	I don't know, I guess maybe for some reason I let Nintendo slip by a little more, and I know people want to call it fanboyism, but I don't.
1896000	1905000	Here's my logic, I let Nintendo get by a little more with having the higher price because that controller is really kind of like the core of the system and the motion and everything,
1905000	1909000	but I don't know, I guess one could argue that it's the same thing on the Playstation 3.
1909000	1913000	I don't know, but the motion shit on the Playstation 3 is very kind of...
1913000	1914000	Last minute?
1914000	1919000	Not really last minute, but just kind of, well, a little last minute, but just kind of useless, I think.
1919000	1922000	I like this comment from Alpha Canagram in chat, he says,
1922000	1927000	Sky, wait, Game Boy Advance with cable for the GameCube was most expensive.
1927000	1933000	That's true, because you'd have to buy the Game Boy Advance with cable, and if you wanted to have any enjoyment out of Crystal Chronicles, you had to get four of those.
1933000	1936000	You know we actually still kept our Game Boy Advances for that reason?
1936000	1937000	Yeah.
1937000	1939000	So that we could play Pac-Man Versus?
1939000	1944000	I was going to say, I can only think of like three games that even use that feature, no, four, because Animal Crossing was one.
1944000	1948000	And yeah, Animal Crossing, Pac-Man Versus, Crystal Chronicles, and Zelda.
1948000	1949000	Zelda.
1949000	1950000	For sorts.
1950000	1953000	Yeah, and that's really it, just a handful of games.
1953000	1956000	But Pac-Man Versus is awesome.
1956000	1961000	And you know it's only a little time before the DS and Wii start to see more of that stuff, too.
1961000	1964000	Well, didn't Pac-Man Versus come out on the Namco Museum DS?
1964000	1966000	Yes, that's right.
1966000	1967000	That's pretty cool.
1967000	1968000	It is pretty cool.
1968000	1974000	Not enough to get me to buy Namco games all over again, those classic collections that I keep re-releasing.
1974000	1978000	Random thoughts, speaking of classic collections, that just kind of make me go, huh.
1978000	1985000	I was randomly at a record store earlier this week, because I was, gasp, shock and awe, buying a CD.
1985000	1986000	I know, I know.
1986000	1991000	I was actually buying a CD, and this place sells video games as well, they sell used video games.
1991000	2000000	And I actually saw on the play, and I was actually looking at old Genesis and Nintendo and Atari to see if there was anything really cool in the retro stuff.
2000000	2001000	It was all sports.
2001000	2002000	It was all sports stuff.
2002000	2005000	Dreamcast was all the NBA, NHL, so that's pretty much all they had.
2005000	2011000	But one thing I noticed on the PlayStation 2 was an Activision anthology, and I never even knew this game existed.
2011000	2015000	Because the Activision releases an anthology on every system.
2015000	2019000	You know, they had one on PlayStation 1, they've had one on the PC, I actually own the one on PC.
2019000	2020000	They've had a ton of them.
2020000	2026000	I didn't realize they had one on PlayStation 2, but I just thought it was funny, because I'm reading the back of the box, like all the games that are in it.
2026000	2032000	And this is how they're selling the game, is that A, it talks about, you can do cool effects to the games while you're playing.
2032000	2035000	Like, you can play Pitfall, but it's in a cube or something.
2035000	2039000	But then the other thing, I thought it was really funny, because it lists all these games, and underneath that it says,
2039000	2047000	Never before seen in an Activision compilation, Pitfall 2 and some of these other really obscure Activision games.
2047000	2051000	Although I don't think Pitfall 2 is that obscure, but the other ones that were listed were very obscure.
2051000	2053000	Like, Bridge. What's that?
2053000	2055000	I think I'm going to order a freeloader.
2055000	2057000	You're going to order the Activision one? What?
2057000	2058000	No, a freeloader.
2058000	2059000	Oh, freeloader. Oh.
2059000	2060000	Oh.
2060000	2063000	We'll talk more about that a little later, I bet.
2063000	2069000	So, another person jumping from the Sony ship would be Phil Harrison.
2069000	2075000	He's actually resigned from Sony Computer Entertainment, which is sad, because that only leaves Kaz left.
2075000	2083000	And, luckily though, it's not, was it not, oh God, the crazy guy.
2083000	2084000	Ken Kutaragi.
2084000	2089000	Ken Kutaragi, yeah. Thank God he's not the only one left piloting this boat here.
2089000	2095000	But, no, that does leave Kaz. I believe there were some rumors on where he was going to go,
2095000	2103000	including, you know, Atari to, I don't know why he would jump from one ship to another sinking ship, but whatever.
2103000	2110000	But, sad to see him go, because he was actually kind of a voice of logic, I guess, for the company.
2110000	2115000	But who needs that, really?
2115000	2119000	I don't know. But that is weird. If it's true, he went to Atari.
2119000	2124000	That's kind of like, I don't know, but maybe he can help fix things there. I don't know.
2124000	2127000	That'd be nice to see them turn around.
2127000	2132000	All right, well, you know, with all this talk about Lost Odyssey and what a great RPG it is,
2132000	2137000	sometimes I think we've neglected some other RPGs that came out where they were actually really amazing.
2137000	2141000	One of them was Persona 3, and I admit, I did not get to really play much of Persona 3.
2141000	2144000	I've just heard from other people how freaking phenomenal it is.
2144000	2147000	But now I'm glad I'm going to have an excuse to revisit it, because apparently,
2147000	2154000	Persona FES, which is an expansion to Persona 3, is actually coming out here in the U.S. on April 22,
2154000	2156000	and it'll set you back $29.99.
2156000	2159000	But the cool thing about it, now obviously this is a PlayStation 2 game.
2159000	2165000	It's not in the current gen of consoles. It's in PlayStation 2, but obviously that's what a lot of people still have.
2165000	2171000	But for such a low price, for such a huge game, you get both the enhanced version of Persona 3,
2171000	2176000	and new bonus features, and a new chapter that is apparently 30-plus hours.
2176000	2179000	So this is kind of like Oblivion game of the year edition, but for Persona.
2179000	2181000	For 30 bucks, which isn't bad.
2181000	2184000	There's still pretty good stuff coming out on the PlayStation 2.
2184000	2191000	And luckily though, a lot of the people that put out really crappy shovelware games for the PS2 have now moved to the Wii.
2191000	2194000	So you get a pretty good crowd, although there are still some.
2194000	2198000	But luckily though, they've adopted the price point at $14.99 retail,
2198000	2202000	and you know, you can't beat that, even if it does suck.
2202000	2210000	Well, you can download a lot of games for five bucks, so I don't know, $14.99 still feels too expensive for me for a crap game.
2210000	2212000	You know, Hannah Montana goes to college or whatever the hell they put out.
2212000	2213000	What?
2213000	2216000	I don't know. I pulled that name out of thin air.
2216000	2219000	You want to know what status I think that they would make that game?
2219000	2221000	They just might. Patent pending.
2221000	2223000	Why don't you go to college? She's rich.
2223000	2226000	I don't own the copyright to Hannah Montana or the trailer.
2226000	2229000	Well, if I were really rich, I would want to be fully educated.
2229000	2230000	True.
2230000	2235000	But then again, if you're, you know, a puppet of Disney, then...
2235000	2240000	In my mind, it's a sitcom, just like Saved by the Bell went to college at one point.
2240000	2244000	I think it's just inevitable that all the Disney Channel stars need to go to college at some point.
2244000	2247000	That would have saved Brittany from her fate.
2247000	2248000	Perhaps.
2248000	2251000	Goofy goes to college.
2251000	2252000	Garsh.
2252000	2253000	Can I read the next story, please?
2253000	2254000	You may.
2254000	2259000	Well, Motorstorm 2 is going to be coming out.
2259000	2267000	It says it will be out in time for the winter holiday to be politically correct.
2267000	2273000	I'm so excited that they're releasing game on Festivus.
2273000	2274000	Decemberween.
2274000	2277000	Gives you something to celebrate.
2277000	2280000	So what's going to be so exciting about Motorstorm 2?
2280000	2281000	It's island themed.
2281000	2286000	Which is so, you know, wintery.
2286000	2288000	That might be kind of fun, though.
2288000	2291000	I did think the first one had too much dirt.
2291000	2293000	This one seems to have plenty of dirt, too.
2293000	2295000	It's in the middle of a desert.
2295000	2297000	I'm sorry.
2297000	2299000	Too much dirt for you.
2299000	2309000	Although, you know what, I really have to say that the artist's joystick where we got this information from are very creative.
2309000	2316000	I would have preferred to see Motorstorm 2 on the moon, because I don't think they've done a good off-road moon racing game.
2316000	2320000	Actually, there was Cruis'n World.
2320000	2322000	Wasn't there a level in Stunt Race FX?
2322000	2325000	Cruis'n World had you go play on the moon.
2325000	2330000	And then you ran into aliens that had Bill Clinton and some chick in a hot tub.
2330000	2331000	Thank you.
2331000	2332000	Malholus in chat.
2332000	2333000	I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
2333000	2334000	We have a lot of new chatters tonight.
2334000	2335000	Welcome, all you guys.
2335000	2338000	Malholus in chat says, moon patrol.
2338000	2339000	I am straight.
2339000	2340000	That's old school right there.
2340000	2341000	Moon patrol.
2341000	2342000	That's all the moon game you need.
2342000	2344000	Rob, did you take a good look at the screen capture?
2344000	2345000	Wait.
2345000	2349000	You know, I was just thinking, there's all these bastardized Atari games from years past.
2349000	2351000	Why didn't they ever put out a bastardized moon patrol?
2351000	2352000	That's what I'm curious about.
2352000	2353000	Or did they?
2353000	2354000	And I just missed it.
2354000	2356000	What picture am I looking for?
2356000	2357000	The screen capture.
2357000	2361000	They took a picture from Motorstorm and put a pond and a palm tree on it.
2361000	2363000	Made out of Microsoft Paint.
2363000	2364000	Cute.
2364000	2366000	I have to show this in the chat room, because it's hilarious.
2366000	2367000	Pretty cute.
2367000	2369000	Oh, I just thought of it.
2369000	2374000	Hannah Montana goes to her first frat party.
2374000	2376000	Hannah Montana goes wild.
2376000	2379000	Hannah Montana overdoses from drugs.
2379000	2380000	It's inevitable.
2380000	2382000	Hannah Montana gets a podcast.
2382000	2384000	They already do crap like that.
2384000	2385000	It's called the Evening News.
2385000	2386000	There you go.
2386000	2387000	Malholus again.
2387000	2388000	Hannah Montana goes to the moon.
2388000	2389000	There it is.
2389000	2390000	Right there.
2390000	2391000	Like, two things we need, right?
2391000	2392000	Together.
2392000	2393000	Alright.
2393000	2394000	Enough of this.
2394000	2395000	I don't know when we decided we needed more Hannah Montana, but it's funny.
2395000	2396000	We do not need more Hannah Montana.
2396000	2398000	We need less of Hannah Montana.
2398000	2403000	What we do need more of is more colors in PS3.
2403000	2404000	And, there is a rumor.
2404000	2406000	I was just thinking that.
2406000	2407000	I know.
2407000	2408000	No, I wasn't actually.
2408000	2410000	I can read minds.
2410000	2414000	It's a skill I learned.
2414000	2415000	Okay.
2415000	2419000	So, there is a new SKU coming out for the 48 PS3.
2419000	2424000	I know this for a fact, because they're going to take out Spider-Man 3, the Blu-Ray.
2424000	2426000	Because, Sony thinks, you know what?
2426000	2428000	Blu-Ray is a winning format.
2428000	2431500	We do not need to tease you with Spider-Man 3.
2431500	2434000	You will just buy your own fucking Blu-Ray movies.
2434000	2438000	So, there is going to be a new SKU coming out.
2438000	2443520	And, apparently, some Circuit City employees have begun receiving their shipments of these
2443520	2444520	new PS3s.
2444520	2451660	And, on the shipping box, there is a model number, which is CECHH01.
2451660	2458560	And for those who may remember a while back when we covered that the FCC had an item filed
2458560	2464400	from Sony regarding a white PS3 while the item numbers happened to match.
2464400	2470960	So, is it going to be the white system coming out to replace the black one with the Spider-Man
2470960	2471960	3?
2471960	2472960	Maybe.
2472960	2473960	I don't know.
2473960	2475960	We'll have to see, I guess.
2475960	2479520	But, if that's the case, it's going to be coming soon.
2479520	2484620	Are there really people that are like, I mean, do these people really, really exist that
2484620	2489540	are like, I'm not going to get a PlayStation 3 until they release them in white?
2489540	2491360	Or until they release them in red?
2491360	2493200	Or what are the colors that we talked about?
2493200	2496360	The silver thing that we talked about on another show in another country.
2496360	2497360	I don't think that...
2497360	2498360	Are there really those people?
2498360	2499360	I don't think that there are.
2499360	2502960	But, I mean, people may be with the DS because it's cheaper.
2502960	2508440	But I don't think color is really going to, I don't know, sway you on buying the system
2508440	2509440	or not.
2509440	2512720	I mean, people aren't going to go, you know, it's $400.
2512720	2516360	If only it were in white, I would really just make the purchase.
2516360	2520200	I just need something that matches the drapes and black doesn't do it for me.
2520200	2523240	I fucking hate when they come out with new system colors because then they have to come
2523240	2528120	out with new accessory colors and new everything colors and it just sucks.
2528120	2529200	Lots of comments in chat.
2529200	2534800	Brad from Pod Culture says, Skye, I waited till Blue to get my DS.
2534800	2537660	With Nintendo, though, it's inevitable that they're going to come out in other colors.
2537660	2539920	That is still a little crazy.
2539920	2543520	Not that I'm excusing Nintendo's color thing, but you'll notice, whatever happened to the
2543520	2544640	pink Wiis?
2544640	2545640	Whatever happened to that?
2545640	2546760	And the blue Wiis and the green Wiis?
2546760	2547760	Whatever happened to that?
2547760	2549960	They didn't need to do it, that's what, I guess.
2549960	2553480	SSJ100Matt says, Rob would hold out for a Hello Kitty PS3.
2553480	2554480	Damn right.
2554480	2556280	I would love to get a Hello Kitty PS3.
2556280	2559840	That would be the best.
2559840	2561920	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to join in.
2561920	2566420	We do try to keep an eye on Justin.TV's chat room as well, but sometimes I have a hard
2566420	2568940	time staying on top of that because that's two different chat rooms.
2568940	2571280	That's a lot.
2571280	2576680	Something you're going to be able to play on those white PlayStations would be lots
2576680	2581320	and lots of games coming to the PlayStation Store.
2581320	2589040	25 old school titles have been leaked by the European version of the PlayStation Store.
2589040	2593480	Well, also, there are some pretty cool titles in there.
2593480	2595240	No, there are some very cool titles in there.
2595240	2597620	That's what makes me think it's probably fake.
2597620	2598620	It's not fake.
2598620	2602320	These are from the European version of the ESRB is where they got these titles from.
2602320	2604080	Oh, I thought it was a store delete.
2604080	2607600	Oh, no, it was the PEGI.
2607600	2608600	I guess leaked the same region.
2608600	2613360	Okay, is there a version of the, oh, I thought it was Sony that accidentally somehow made
2613360	2614760	these visible for a minute.
2614760	2618000	Well, then I guess it's legit and there are some cool games coming out because one of
2618000	2623240	them, Bust-A-Groove, Holla!, those folks like their old school music games and stuff, very
2623240	2625120	excited to hear that.
2625120	2631440	Crash Bandicoot 3, Colony Wars, Cool Borders 2 and 3, Destruction Derby 2, Devil Dies,
2631440	2638140	Everybody's Golf, Klona, Klonoa, Klonoa's like the best game ever, Kurushi Final, Motor
2638140	2644080	Tune Grand Prix, Namco Museum 1, 2, and 4, I don't know what happened to 3, Omega Boost,
2644080	2651320	Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Type 4, Rollcage, Spyro, Tekken 2, 3, Twisted Metal, Vib ribbon,
2651320	2654520	Wipeout 3, Wipeout 2097, lots of stuff.
2654520	2655520	Vib ribbon.
2655520	2656520	That's pretty awesome.
2656520	2657520	That is pretty awesome.
2657520	2659520	That game is crack.
2659520	2664960	And actually, I don't know if a lot of people remember, Colony Wars is actually pretty decent
2664960	2668920	as far as the space shooter goes, same with Cool Borders, that's pretty fun.
2668920	2669920	Omega Boost is awesome.
2669920	2672320	Son of Dad says, Intelligent Cube, please.
2672320	2673320	There you go.
2673320	2676520	He said, don't they have the PSP one, didn't they come out with like a sequel-ish thing
2676520	2677520	to that game?
2677520	2678520	Yeah, they have a couple of them.
2678520	2683600	And let's see, Crunky Boy Jr. in chat says, I got Klonoa once and some antibiotics cleared
2683600	2684600	it right up.
2684600	2691000	Hey, Klonoa was a great game, but it was messed up at the end.
2691000	2694000	I have played all the way through Klonoa, thank you.
2694000	2695000	Nice.
2695000	2701080	So, in other bundling news, in Europe, they're going to get a pretty decent bundle, I'm going
2701080	2707760	to say, that is the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Bundle.
2707760	2718160	And it's a 40 gigabyte PS3, I'm sorry, my apologies, 80 gigabyte, oh, sorry, they're
2718160	2721120	doing two of them, my apologies.
2721120	2726160	I was just staring at the red box because it's, well, kind of red and black and very
2726160	2730400	cool colored, and it's got a silver car up on the front of it, I can't see what it is
2730400	2742520	though, but they're saying that it's going to be out on, looks like March 29th and retails
2742520	2749120	for 3.99 euro, so that's pretty cool.
2749120	2752000	I love all this hubba loo over prologue.
2752000	2755000	It's not even the actual game, it's just prologue.
2755000	2758600	But to be honest, I think this game's going to hurt their sales for the full game.
2758600	2759600	You think?
2759600	2765880	Well, for people, if I had to buy a Gran Turismo game, I don't think I'd buy the full one because
2765880	2771940	I don't race 200 cars, there's only a few cars that actually probably race, and after
2771940	2777120	I play this game, prologue, for however many months until the full game comes out, I'll
2777120	2778120	probably be sick of it.
2778120	2782960	I'll just be like, okay, whatever, I'm done, I'm not going to spend another $50 or whatever
2782960	2787200	to upgrade to have more cars.
2787200	2793480	Now the smart thing to do would be to release the retail version of Gran Turismo 5 and release
2793480	2798700	a $20 update that would give you all the additional cars and tracks.
2798700	2799700	That would never happen though.
2799700	2804320	RossdielUT in chat says, Loki, Gran Turismo isn't for you, it's for crazed car freaks.
2804320	2806040	There's another bundle listed on here too.
2806040	2807040	What's that?
2807040	2815560	A Blu-ray bundle, the 40 gigabyte PS3 with Spiderman 300 and Casino Royale on March 19th.
2815560	2821480	Now that's reasonable, because obviously now that Blu-ray has officially won or whatever,
2821480	2823400	that's totally understandable.
2823400	2826480	There's a lot of people that are going to buy PlayStation 3s just because it plays Blu-rays
2826480	2827560	and games.
2827560	2829440	You want to know why there's going to be a lot of people to do that?
2829440	2831600	Because that's how PlayStation 2 won.
2831600	2836040	Hey, I bought my PlayStation 2, well actually no, I didn't buy it as a DVD player, I just
2836040	2839840	bought it because Armored Core was coming out on it, and I love me some Armored Core.
2839840	2844300	Except I didn't buy Armored Core 4, whatever.
2844300	2849040	I liked what Akdeft in chat says too, Akdeft says, Gran Turismo 5 prologue, Gran Turismo
2849040	2855480	5 introduction, Gran Turismo 5, and then Gran Turismo 5 epilogue.
2855480	2858320	And yet, no Gran Turismo portable for the PSP.
2858320	2862880	It starts to sound like a Final Fantasy series, it's like Final Fantasy VII games now at some
2862880	2864680	point.
2864680	2869920	And they'll have Final Fantasy prologue with cars.
2869920	2870920	Gran Turismo.
2870920	2876720	There's different kinds of chocobos.
2876720	2879400	You get to try out different chocobos.
2879400	2883600	You may not be ready for Gran Turismo 5, there are plenty of other games to get your attention
2883600	2885360	this week.
2885360	2890880	Starting things off, we have Bully Scholarship Edition coming out on the Wii and Xbox 360.
2890880	2895240	Slightly better than the PlayStation 2 version because it has slightly better graphics and
2895240	2898440	a few more missions.
2898440	2903680	The game I teased last week, Let's Ride Friends Forever, coming out on the DS.
2903680	2906360	Worst name ever.
2906360	2907360	If you're into baseball.
2907360	2911000	Or most unintentionally funny name ever, depending on how you look at it.
2911000	2916800	There's going to be two games for you, Sony's MLB 08 The Show, and that's coming on PlayStation
2916800	2918960	2, PlayStation 3, and PSP.
2918960	2926740	And then MLB 2K8 coming out on PS2, PS3, PSP, Wii, and Xbox 360.
2926740	2931840	We have Army of Two coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2931840	2933720	Chicken Hunter on the DS.
2933720	2937680	It's a stupid game where you kill chickens.
2937680	2939400	So it's not just a clever name.
2939400	2942160	No, it's very literal.
2942160	2944440	And imagine Figure Skater.
2944440	2949880	It is a game where you are a figure skater and you get to do little gay ass moves.
2949880	2951600	Yay, figure skater.
2951600	2955040	I'm almost offended by that comment.
2955040	2957680	I'm sorry, I'll never compare you to figure skater ever again.
2957680	2958680	Yeah, exactly.
2958680	2962760	Let's see what else we have here.
2962760	2970000	Also Arctic Stud Poker Run for the PC, awesome.
2970000	2973840	Silent Hill Origins coming out on PlayStation 2 this week.
2973840	2981520	God of War Chains of Olympus coming out on the PSP, that looks pretty awesome.
2981520	2988200	Pets Bunnies for the DS, yes you two can raise bunnies now, hooray.
2988200	2994680	Let's see, just a small little game called Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii.
2994680	2998400	That will be coming out a week from today, hooray.
2998400	3004360	Ninja Reflex is coming out on the Wii and the DS this week for your Ninja themed party
3004360	3005800	games.
3005800	3012000	World Championship Cards for the PSP, in case you want to play something other than poker.
3012000	3018120	Mystery Dungeon Sheeran the Wanderer coming out on the DS.
3018120	3027640	Let's see, we've also got Spitfire Heroes Tales of the Royal Air Force, that's on DS
3027640	3029200	as well.
3029200	3032320	And Homies Rollers on the DS.
3032320	3033560	You like Homies the Clown?
3033560	3039040	That's like Homies as in those little stupid urban figures they can get out of those machines
3039040	3040040	for 10 cents or 25 cents.
3040040	3043640	Oh, my boss used to collect those.
3043640	3048600	The uh, let's see, I believe that's it.
3048600	3052560	Smash Brothers Brawl, that's really all you need to know for this week.
3052560	3056100	I know, I think Let's Ride Friends Forever doesn't stand much of a chance, but maybe
3056100	3058360	there's a certain audience for that, I don't know.
3058360	3060080	I will tell you what.
3060080	3062180	Uh oh, what?
3062180	3064960	Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a million copies.
3064960	3069240	Oh no, oh here we go, here we go, okay, yes, yes, if Let's Ride Friends Forever sells a
3069240	3071360	million copies, yes, what?
3071360	3074400	We'll do the whole tingle thing and we'll burn Eye of Judgment.
3074400	3078120	We'll need another game in there, just, you know, more of a chance.
3078120	3081040	You want to keep giving the listeners some hope, right?
3081040	3082040	Yeah.
3082040	3083040	Great.
3083040	3087240	The makers of that game just thanked you for selling like, you know, about 100 additional
3087240	3088560	copies they wouldn't have sold otherwise.
3088560	3090040	Here, I'll make it even more fair.
3090040	3092480	The combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever...
3092480	3097400	Whoa, whoa, whoa, so the combined sales between Let's Ride Friends Forever and Eye of Judgment
3097400	3098400	now?
3098400	3099400	Yes.
3099400	3100400	Oh, mark...
3100400	3102760	Because Let's Ride Friends Forever will be lucky to sell 100,000 copies.
3102760	3108120	Somebody mark the date and time of this, oh, it's almost exactly 7 o'clock here on Sunday
3108120	3109120	evening, March 2nd.
3109120	3111440	It will never sell anything, okay, come on.
3111440	3115720	Well that's, that's something, that's giving the listeners, that's for the little meter
3115720	3119580	some of the chatters made up, some of the chatters actually made up a little meter that
3119580	3122880	looks like a telethon thing, and it's like the road to 1 million copies.
3122880	3123880	It'll never happen.
3123880	3126400	Now it gives them something to add to that.
3126400	3130000	It'll never, ever happen.
3130000	3132600	Just like Let's Ride Friends Forever will never, ever sell.
3132600	3136460	Here's the thing, here's the thing, chat room, you gotta get him to keep adding games to
3136460	3141560	it until he doesn't realize that he's put like 20 games towards the total.
3141560	3146560	Oh yeah, someone noted the OLR wiki to add that.
3146560	3150120	Joel Banjo says another one for the OLR wiki, I forgot to mention Housekeeping, this would
3150120	3151120	have been good.
3151120	3157120	They created a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio, and you can wiki stuff on it, even though
3157120	3163120	I guess, well we have an official Wikipedia article, but now we have our own freaking
3163120	3169360	entire wiki, which is amazing because, you know, I didn't really, you'd think I wrote
3169360	3174700	it or Loki wrote that article, but we've never really worked on that, it was totally the
3174700	3177200	fans that did that, so that was really cool.
3177200	3178200	And uh...
3178200	3179640	I haven't even seen it.
3179640	3180640	On Wikipedia?
3180640	3184200	Oh, well I thought you meant, oh you meant on Wikipedia, I thought you meant like a...
3184200	3185640	Yeah, the actual article on Wikipedia.
3185640	3186760	A wiki set up for us.
3186760	3190200	Yes, but now there is a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki, and you can...
3190200	3191200	That's what I was talking about.
3191200	3196880	Yes, that, well I'll give you that link right now so you can check it out, it's orangeloungeradio.wikia,
3196880	3202200	that's W-I-K-I-A dot com, so check it out, and somebody just linked it in chat as well,
3202200	3203200	so check that out.
3203200	3207280	Alright, meanwhile, let's go back to traveling the globe and looking at upcoming releases,
3207280	3210560	and we'll start on the Xbox 360 in Japan.
3210560	3214280	You get a new version of the console coming out, the Xbox 360 Arcade hits Japan, and with
3214280	3219340	that comes some price reductions, yay, including Riot Act, which you might know as Crackdown,
3219340	3224840	and Saints Row gets some price reductions this week on the Xbox 360 in Japan.
3224840	3229560	Coming out on the Playstation 3, the DualShock 3 makes its way out there, as well as Guitar
3229560	3234880	Hero 3, Legends of Rock finally comes out in Japan, the Satin Silver, that's what I
3234880	3241400	was trying to think of earlier, the Satin Silver Playstation 3 comes out as well.
3241400	3248080	Continuing our trip in Japan on the Nintendo Wii, Family Jockey comes out in Japan, also
3248080	3252960	Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, I did not realize this game had quite the delay between the
3252960	3258520	US and Japan, but it is finally coming out in Japan this week, so I guess we're not the
3258520	3261520	only ones that have to wait for big titles sometimes, it looks like Japan had to wait
3261520	3264720	for this one, that's kind of surprised me, and I look to see if it's a price reduction
3264720	3267360	or something like that, it's not, it's full price, so this must be the first time they're
3267360	3270920	getting that, so that kind of surprised me.
3270920	3274960	Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin, and it comes with a-
3274960	3276560	Nobunaga's ambition something.
3276560	3277560	I don't-
3277560	3278560	Online, I think.
3278560	3282960	Well, it comes with what's called a power-up kit, and I'm not exactly sure what a power-up
3282960	3287000	kit has in it, so this is something they haven't released yet.
3287000	3292200	Maybe it's two different Nobunaga games, same thing with Double Kings or whatever they call
3292200	3294320	that over there.
3294320	3297920	I would like to know what exactly the power kit includes.
3297920	3298920	It's drugs.
3298920	3302040	Perhaps, but it does look like another version of Nobunaga's ambition, dang, the last time
3302040	3306600	I played this game was on the NES, and look how far it's come, it's like Civilization,
3306600	3309040	I remember Civ 1, I have such fond memories of that game.
3309040	3314840	And I had a Nobunaga's ambition game that came out the beginning of February for PlayStation
3314840	3315840	2.
3315840	3320320	Yeah, but now I can't play those games anymore, they're too complicated for me, I'm not smart
3320320	3322440	enough to play those games, I'll admit it.
3322440	3325240	I think that's just exactly what it boils down to.
3325240	3326240	They're too much for me now.
3326240	3327240	They get too complicated.
3327240	3329960	They need a Nobunaga's ambition party game.
3329960	3334800	Yeah, they need like, you know how they dumb down Madden for Wii owners?
3334800	3337240	That's what I need, I need a dumbed-down version of Nobunaga's ambition.
3337240	3342160	Swing the remote down to conquer Japan.
3342160	3344320	It's too bad they don't have achievement points.
3344320	3348520	And I accidentally closed out my list, so I'll tell you what, why don't we go to Europe
3348520	3349520	and then we'll come back to Japan?
3349520	3352460	Well, you know what that actually makes me think, did we ever get a current-gen release
3352460	3355200	of Risk?
3355200	3356200	Not that I can think of.
3356200	3358200	But wouldn't that be a great Xbox Live title?
3358200	3361360	It'd be cool if we had Risk and Access and Allies, wouldn't that be cool?
3361360	3363840	That would be very cool.
3363840	3364840	I love games like that.
3364840	3367720	Oh wait, I got the Japanese release dates back, never mind.
3367720	3368720	Fine.
3368720	3370840	Europe can wait a little longer, they're used to it.
3370840	3372840	That was me!
3372840	3375680	It was, below the bell, I'm sorry, party foul.
3375680	3378760	Dear European listeners, please send Rob a smack in the head via email.
3378760	3381280	Send me your cards and letters.
3381280	3384200	Whatever, they get Mario Kart early.
3384200	3385200	Yeah, that's right.
3385200	3387300	So you know, shut up.
3387300	3389280	Go stuff yourself with a crumpet.
3389280	3390280	Hey!
3390280	3398320	I love Britain, I love all of Europe, I love France, I love Spain, I love them all.
3398320	3399320	Alright.
3399320	3404560	On the PlayStation 2, also Guitar Hero 3 comes out there as well.
3404560	3411320	And guess what, as if there wasn't enough Pachinko in your life, Hisu Pachinko Pachi
3411320	3415320	Slot Koryoku Series Volume 10 comes out as well.
3415320	3420240	By the way, there's another one that is a Neon Genesis Evangelion version of Pachinko,
3420240	3424200	because I know you were just thinking about wanting to have that.
3424200	3431560	On the Nintendo DS, Bomberman gets a price cut, Doraemon no Bita Ton Midori no Kyojinden
3431560	3432960	DS comes out.
3432960	3436480	In other words, it's Doraemon on the DS yet again.
3436480	3441560	And lastly on the PSP, and then I promise we can do the Europe dates, Dragon Quest and
3441560	3447160	Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Portable, that is a combo kit of those games.
3447160	3448560	It's like an Ultimate Hits.
3448560	3449560	So there you have it.
3449560	3452580	And also, Valkyrie Profile also moves into the Ultimate Hits.
3452580	3457600	The Lenneth and what was the other one, Slo-Mera or whatever it was called, they both move
3457600	3460160	into the Greatest Hits collection.
3460160	3466560	Alright, now that all of Britain hates me, and Europe in general, let's go to their release
3466560	3468560	dates, shall we, Jamie?
3468560	3469560	Fine.
3469560	3474160	Well these are all on the 7th, and one of them pisses me off, but I have a certain bias
3474160	3475800	against it.
3475800	3482560	Coming out is Army of Two on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Blacksite Area 51 on PS3, Bully's
3482560	3488840	Scholarship Edition, Xbox 360 and Wii, Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed on Wii, Dynasty
3488840	3498360	Warriors 6 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Jack Keane on PC, MX vs ATV Untamed on a bunch of crap,
3498360	3504720	Rock Band on PlayStation 2, that's a big one, The Destiny of Zorro on Wii, Victorious Boxers
3504720	3509720	on Wii, and the one that pisses me off, Warhammer 40K Dawn of War.
3509720	3512320	Wait, Victorious Boxers on Wii?
3512320	3513320	Yes.
3513320	3514320	Oh, Victorious.
3514320	3518200	I thought you said Victorias, and I'm thinking like, is that like Victoria's Closet for Men?
3518200	3519200	Like now they're expanding?
3519200	3520680	I thought that you were thinking of Spice Girls.
3520680	3523200	You mean Victoria's Secret?
3523200	3524200	She has a penis?
3524200	3526040	No, I thought you said Victoria's Closet.
3526040	3527040	Oh, maybe I did.
3527040	3528640	That was a really crappy show.
3528640	3531040	That was Veronica's Closet, it was Chrissy Alley.
3531040	3536400	No, Victoria's Secret, I thought I heard her say Victoria's Boxers.
3536400	3540240	Maybe my mind is just focused on underwear right now, I don't know.
3540240	3544480	See, you said Victoria's, though, and I was thinking that you were bringing up Spice
3544480	3546480	Girls.
3546480	3552200	They're a pair of boxers, and on the back of them is a big peace sign, you know, like
3552200	3555120	the V for victory or whatever.
3555120	3557120	A hand doing a V.
3557120	3559120	Please let's change the topic.
3559120	3561680	I hate Warhammer 40K.
3561680	3563240	Why?
3563240	3567460	Because I had an ex who did nothing but play Warhammer 40K and paint his retarded little
3567460	3571480	models on end for days at a time.
3571480	3575240	I tried painting those once, and then I saw that they were six millimeters tall, and I'm
3575240	3576240	like, fuck this.
3576240	3577920	I am not doing this.
3577920	3582880	And I'm a big gamer, I love gaming, but there just comes a point where there's this weird
3582880	3588880	obsession with the little figures and for building terrain from scratch, and that's
3588880	3592880	all he ever did, so yeah, I broke up with him to play with, you know, to hang out with
3592880	3594120	some guy that played Rifts.
3594120	3599320	It was fun, though, running over those little figurines with a toy train, because, you know,
3599320	3602640	if you're going to build your own landscape, you might as well already have a train set
3602640	3604920	and landscape built already for that.
3604920	3609520	Well, I can understand having a project, that's one thing, but when your entire life is your
3609520	3611600	project, that's a little something else.
3611600	3613440	That and you didn't have a job.
3613440	3614440	Yeah.
3614440	3618400	Speaking about building little figurines, Legos, you know, you see a lot of Lego spinoffs
3618400	3620880	for different games, including Indiana Jones and Star Wars.
3620880	3626480	Well, now EGM wants to try to make us believe that there's going to be Lego Halo.
3626480	3631360	As if we can believe anything that's in their April issue, but they have screenshots to
3631360	3636640	prove that it's real, you know, much like Mushroom Kingdom Hearts, but sure, if you
3636640	3637640	want to believe...
3637640	3644280	The minute I saw a headline that said, April EGM announces Lego Halo or whatever it was,
3644280	3647000	I was like, oh, haha, funny, April Fools joke.
3647000	3648000	I hate April Fools.
3648000	3649000	You know...
3649000	3650420	Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
3650420	3654240	It would be cool if it were real, I don't think it is, and I don't think you would try
3654240	3655240	to...
3655240	3656240	It's not, come on.
3656240	3660360	You wouldn't announce something like this in your April magazine, you know, and of course
3660360	3663680	it's their exclusive, they say, and stuff like that.
3663680	3669600	Trust me, if this was a real exclusive, 1up.com would be whoring the shit out of this right
3669600	3676160	now, okay, because they like to tease their exclusives, so, whatever.
3676160	3679440	You don't need any more Halo or Lego Halo.
3679440	3684360	Well, I almost thought this was a joke when I first read about it too, but no, it is true,
3684360	3688320	and it's one of the more interesting types of development in gaming I've heard in a long
3688320	3689320	time.
3689320	3690320	Okay, here's the thing.
3690320	3692760	You know Treasure made a shooter years ago called Bangayo?
3692760	3693760	Bangayo!
3693760	3694760	Okay, well, here's...
3694760	3696760	Isn't that a classic game?
3696760	3701360	Yeah, well, that's right, it's coming out on the DS, right, as Bangayo Spirits, okay?
3701360	3702820	That's not the part I thought was a joke.
3702820	3705800	Here's the part I thought was a joke.
3705800	3711720	It uses what's called sound load, and what you do, you share custom levels, high scores
3711720	3717400	and replay videos, but you don't do it using the built-in Wi-Fi or any of that, no, no,
3717400	3718960	it's sound.
3718960	3722880	That's right, because the DS has a microphone and a speaker, I guess you put the DSs really
3722880	3728260	close to each other, and what happens is that the data is turned into noises and sound,
3728260	3732840	and it's played out the speaker of your DS, and then your friend picks it up on his microphone
3732840	3736600	or his or her microphone DS, and turned back into game data.
3736600	3738120	What a weird concept.
3738120	3743080	And the other thing you can do with this is you can put them in MP3 format or whatever
3743080	3746560	and spread them out on the internet, so people can download them that way.
3746560	3748880	It's Treasure.
3748880	3753120	It's kind of neat, I'll admit, but I totally, when I first read this, I'm like, this is
3753120	3756360	the weirdest thing I've ever heard, but yeah, and then I'm thinking like, wow, we could
3756360	3761520	like put a custom level on our podcast and be like, okay, Bangayo owners, turn on your,
3761520	3764200	you know, and that's probably exactly what they want, which is why this feature is in
3764200	3765200	there, but.
3765200	3769920	Let's do that, because everybody loves listening to the sound of a modem when you pick it up.
3769920	3774560	Or if you put a CD in a, or if you put an old CD-ROM in a regular CD player and you
3774560	3775560	hear that.
3775560	3780520	No, it was like, did you ever put in the Symphony of the Night CD and then listen to the hidden
3780520	3781520	track?
3781520	3784520	Yeah, but the thing about PlayStation, yes, I have done that, but the thing about PlayStation
3784520	3788320	discs is for whatever reason, I don't know if this is the coding or whatever, but if
3788320	3791400	you try to play track one on a PlayStation disc, it's silence.
3791400	3795980	You won't hear the noise that you will in like an old school, like go find yourself
3795980	3802000	a copy of Encarta and put it in a regular CD player, and if you know what I'm talking
3802000	3805600	about in your old school, because we did this in junior high, we would take a copy of Encarta
3805600	3809360	and put it in a regular CD player, and it makes the most hideous noise, and what you
3809360	3813100	do is, it was like the dumbass joke you would play is that you would turn the radio thing
3813100	3819200	up full blast, close the door, and run.
3819200	3821440	I guess.
3821440	3828720	I just remember putting them in, especially, they'd also do it on a PC Engine Duo disc
3828720	3833520	and say, this is a game disc, do not listen to this or your speakers will die.
3833520	3836880	That type of thing.
3836880	3843120	Very interesting feature, I have to admit, this is a game I probably wouldn't have thought
3843120	3846760	to go run out and buy or even really check out just because there's too many other games
3846760	3850700	on the table, right, but now I'm kind of like, I might have to look at this game just for
3850700	3851700	this feature.
3851700	3854360	I'll tell you in one word why I'm getting this game.
3854360	3855360	Why?
3855360	3856360	Treasure!
3856360	3857920	I should have known.
3857920	3858920	Treasure!
3858920	3861280	There's always one still looking for Chameleon Twist.
3861280	3865800	Alright, well, let's move on, that's all I have to say until the game comes out.
3865800	3873000	Well, I know that quite a number of our listeners are into Rock Band, so something that everyone
3873000	3878600	should be happy about is that there is a Grateful Dead pack coming out for a Rock Band that
3878600	3885680	will have China Cat Sunflower, Casey Jones, Sugar Magnolia, Trucken, Franklin's Tower,
3885680	3887560	and I Need A Miracle.
3887560	3892120	I think that that's pretty cool because Grateful Dead is pretty cool.
3892120	3895840	Now I wonder if you can put weed in the smoke machine kit because that would be the full
3895840	3897440	dead experience right there.
3897440	3898840	You know what?
3898840	3900120	You laugh about that.
3900120	3904440	Apparently, okay, one of my customers, no, no, no, no, no, not about the weed thing.
3904440	3909960	No, one of my customers actually saw the kit set up at one of the GameStop's, I guess,
3909960	3918360	in Iowa or Idaho or wherever the hell he's from, and it was actually pretty funny.
3918360	3922000	He said it just looks like a fog machine with lights, and the lights basically hook up to
3922000	3923000	your sound.
3923000	3928800	They're all sound activated, like, you know, your sound out or whatever your stereo system,
3928800	3930560	and they react to the sound that you do.
3930560	3934560	So we could do the show, and it would react to our speaking and stuff.
3934560	3935560	Just what we need.
3935560	3938960	Well, there's a little bit more to this story.
3938960	3945480	For people who are not so Rock Band oriented and are more Guitar Hero 3 oriented, actually
3945480	3951920	no doubt having some releases on there, which no doubt cool, Gwen Stefani's solo bad because
3951920	3953720	she sucks.
3953720	3956280	That and she's got mental problems, but moving on.
3956280	3957640	Wow, tell us what you really think.
3957640	3960080	What songs are coming out from No Doubt, do we know?
3960080	3963680	Don't Speak, Excuse Me Mister, and Sunday Morning.
3963680	3965800	So we don't get Ex-Girlfriend.
3965800	3966800	That's the song I love.
3966800	3972200	No, no Just a Girl, no Spiderwebs, but I mean, my favorite song of theirs is in the list,
3972200	3973400	so I'm happy.
3973400	3974400	What song is that?
3974400	3975400	Don't Speak.
3975400	3976400	Don't Speak.
3976400	3978360	All right, let's hear some clips of these songs that are coming to Rock Band very soon.
3978360	3982080	Here's a clip of the Grateful Dead, so if you got them, smoke them.
3982080	3985080	Just kidding, that's bad.
3985080	4009320	Yes, you can jam to Truckin' pretty soon in Rock Band, and then we have coming to Guitar
4009320	4014880	Hero 3, we have No Doubt, and I'm sure you guys all know Don't Speak, so let's play one
4014880	4018880	of the more lesser known songs, which would be Sunday Morning.
4018880	4041400	At least I'm glad it breathes some life back into Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band in general.
4041400	4046040	Rock Band and the Wheels keep on turnin' with that game.
4046040	4048280	Proud Mary keep on burnin', I don't know.
4048280	4049280	Not yet.
4049280	4050280	Maybe some day.
4050280	4051280	Anyhow.
4051280	4059000	And not to be outdone, from the studio that brings you Hannah Montana, Disney has announced
4059000	4060640	a brand new game for the Wii.
4060640	4062920	Hannah Montana goes to a Grateful Dead concert.
4062920	4063920	No!
4063920	4065880	It's Ultimate Band!
4065880	4069680	Fuck this Rock Band shit, it's the Ultimate Band.
4069680	4072800	And this will be coming out for the Wii and the DS.
4072800	4078000	One thing, though, that you will be happy to know, and maybe this might be a sad thing,
4078000	4081760	is that there will not be any peripherals for this game, it'll be all with the Wii Remote
4081760	4082760	and Nunchuk.
4082760	4086360	So you have to imagine how you're gonna actually play these songs.
4086360	4090840	They have a screenshot that shows apparently the guitar portion of the game, which looks
4090840	4095360	like it's gonna use the two buttons on the Nunchuk as your fret button.
4095360	4097240	So you have two fret buttons.
4097240	4100600	You have one, two, zero, or both.
4100600	4103420	This sounds like Ultimate Suck.
4103420	4107160	You know what, I'm gonna say something pretty daring here.
4107160	4110040	I think this actually isn't a bad idea.
4110040	4111780	Because think about who this game is aimed at.
4111780	4116260	It's aimed at kids, and parents don't want to spend all this frickin' money on all these
4116260	4118660	peripherals that their kids are gonna destroy.
4118660	4124620	So you know what, if you've got a Wii, why not come out with a game that's very similar
4124620	4128280	to Rock Band, but that you don't have to buy all this extra shit for?
4128280	4132180	And of course I'm not gonna like it, probably Jamie, Matt, they're not gonna like it.
4132180	4133720	It's not really made for us, it's a kid's game.
4133720	4139560	I'll try it, but you know, I don't think I'd buy this game, but I'll try it.
4139560	4145460	It is supposed to be coming out towards the holidays, and the DS version will have that
4145460	4150120	brand new dgamer online social network, which is sounding pretty awesome, and I really kind
4150120	4155080	of want to check it out, but that means I have to buy a Disney DS game, and I don't
4155080	4156080	know.
4156080	4163520	ActDeft in chat says, Sky speaks the truth, and GS68 says, Sky is right, ego plus plus.
4163520	4166240	The chat room actually just reminded me of another thing I didn't mention in my gaming
4166240	4167240	week.
4167240	4168240	What's that?
4168240	4169240	Oh, I bought Parappa.
4169240	4170240	Oh, rad.
4170240	4171240	For $15.
4171240	4172240	Nice.
4172240	4174920	At a Hollywood going out of business.
4174920	4179000	Let's see, RossTealUT says, Sky, that kid who got the 98% on Through the Fire and the
4179000	4180000	flames will disagree.
4180000	4181000	Yeah, well, he's a freak.
4181000	4184240	Hey, did I just call a seven-year-old a freak?
4184240	4185240	Cool.
4185240	4187360	That's fine, he's a freak.
4187360	4191360	Uni in chat says, Kids already nom-nomed the hell out of the Wii remote.
4191360	4197760	Makes it sound like the pet dog chewed up the Wii remote and hid it under the couch.
4197760	4201920	If your seven-year-old nom-noms the Wii remote and hides it under the couch, you got issues.
4201920	4203840	I like that phrase, that's funny.
4203840	4204840	What, nom-nom?
4204840	4205840	Nom-nom.
4205840	4209880	Didn't you hear, everything is Caturday now.
4209880	4210880	Everything.
4210880	4212000	Low cat speak.
4212000	4217240	Cronky Boy Jr. tries to put out a zinger here saying, You mean we save money on Wii peripherals?
4217240	4218240	But I'm bummed.
4218240	4219240	Get it?
4219240	4220240	Because the remotes are so fucking expensive.
4220240	4221680	They don't really have real Wii peripherals.
4221680	4226240	I mean, after all, there's like, what, the classic controller and the nunchuck.
4226240	4227440	That's the only thing that plugs into the Wii.
4227440	4230040	Everything else is plastic shit.
4230040	4233120	All right.
4233120	4236840	Well, you know, a lot of folks are very excited about this.
4236840	4239200	I'm sure Mo, remember Mo from a couple weeks ago?
4239200	4240200	Yes.
4240200	4242800	I'm sure she's very excited about this.
4242800	4245000	Still Alive is going to be coming to Rock Band.
4245000	4250520	And Valve threw a little party at Game Developers Conference, and get this, some guy actually
4250520	4253520	tried to steal the song.
4253520	4257480	Okay, here's how it worked, is that Jonathan Coulton was up on stage with his band, they
4257480	4262200	were playing Still Alive, but in Rock Band, because apparently he didn't get 100% on vocals,
4262200	4264640	which is ironically hilarious, but whatever.
4264640	4271100	So they finish, crowd is cheering, and what happens is that this guy from the crowd gets
4271100	4276420	up on stage, walks over to the 360, pulls out a memory card, which I don't know who
4276420	4278680	carries 360 memory cards with him on the go.
4278680	4282240	I mean, back in the day, I used to carry a PlayStation memory card when I go to the arcade
4282240	4285600	and stuff, or, you know, because DDR machines had the memory card slots.
4285600	4286720	They have two or three of those.
4286720	4290040	I can't think of any reason why you would put like a 360 card in your pocket everywhere
4290040	4291040	you go.
4291040	4292880	You go to this Game Developers Conference, whatever.
4292880	4297600	So he pulls out this memory card, he puts it in, messes around, and then finally, one
4297600	4301280	of the harmonious guys walks over and says, what's going on, and this guy says, I'm just
4301280	4303880	grabbing Still Alive, everyone needs to be able to play this.
4303880	4309240	Well, the developer, you know, took it back and deleted the thing off the card, and you
4309240	4310240	know, all is well.
4310240	4312880	Because I don't think this thing would have worked anyway, because it was probably a dev
4312880	4316640	360, and I'm sure this thing wouldn't have worked out in the wild.
4316640	4320240	It wouldn't have worked anyways because of Microsoft's fucked up digital rights management,
4320240	4322080	which we'll get into later, but...
4322080	4323080	Right.
4323080	4324640	Well, apparently, the guy actually wrote about it.
4324640	4328880	The only reason I'm not giving this Idiot of the Week award, or Stupid Guy of the Week,
4328880	4332600	or whatever we're calling it here, award, is because apparently the guy wrote about
4332600	4337760	it in his LiveJournal, and I don't know, don't quote me if this is 100% legitimate.
4337760	4342280	It could be fanfic or some shit, I don't know, but I think it's legit.
4342280	4350080	You can check it out on his LiveJournal, it's algorithmancy.livejournal.com, that's A-L-G-O-R-I-D.
4350080	4355760	I-T-A-H-M-A-N-C-Y.livejournal.com, and he writes in this entry on February 21st, 2008.
4355760	4360000	He writes his side of the story, and he puts a disclaimer at the end, he says, don't try
4360000	4361000	this at home.
4361000	4365780	The only reason I did, because I am an acquaintance of Alex, who works at Harmonix, as well as
4365780	4369160	good friends with several Harmonix folks, and game industry friends give each other
4369160	4373060	free swag all the time, remember, making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material
4373060	4376060	is theft.
4376060	4377480	You know what the only thing I'll give this guy is?
4377480	4378480	Huh?
4378480	4382480	He's got a cool LiveJournal name, that's it.
4382480	4385280	It was kind of a dumb thing to do, but at least he admits it was a little...
4385280	4386960	It was a lot of a dumb thing to do.
4386960	4390400	At least he kind of admits in his LiveJournal thing, though, that it was a lot of dumb,
4390400	4395040	so you know, I'm not going to stupid award him when he begs for mercy.
4395040	4396040	Is that...
4396040	4397520	That's what you get when you drink lots of alcohols.
4397520	4398520	Exactly.
4398520	4402800	Alcohol bad, but still alive good.
4402800	4404560	Alright, before we wrap up...
4404560	4405560	Huh, what's that?
4405560	4407040	I said quite.
4407040	4409920	Before we wrap up, are you going to sing a little rendition for us here in the studio?
4409920	4410920	No.
4410920	4411920	Did you hear our idea?
4411920	4414360	I don't remember if this is the week you were gone, because February was all fucked up,
4414360	4417920	but were you here the week we had the idea that when it comes out, we'll get Mo back,
4417920	4422040	and she'll be our vocalist, and we'll get Matt to play drums, you can play guitar, you
4422040	4426240	and I can work out the guitar somehow, and we'll have an OLR band, and we'll do our rendition.
4426240	4427240	Was it last week?
4427240	4428240	I can't remember.
4428240	4429560	I'm getting old, and the weeks blend together.
4429560	4430560	That's okay, Rob.
4430560	4431560	Anyhow...
4431560	4435120	No, I'm still bringing you your birthday present.
4435120	4436120	Sweet.
4436120	4441360	Alright, speaking of getting old, the older we get, the more we reminisce about the classic
4441360	4446360	games, and that's why we like to pay tribute to the Classic Game of the Week every week.
4446360	4451520	Dark Sakura likes to respect her elders in the gaming world by paying tribute to old
4451520	4458280	classic games, so let's dust off a dusty game and see what Dark Sakura's picked for this
4458280	4459600	week's Classic Game of the Week.
4459600	4460600	What is it?
4460600	4466880	This is actually one of my favorite arcade games ever, and I have it on Saturn, is Cybertroopers
4466880	4477040	Virtual On, which is a 3D robot fighting game done from a behind-the-view of your own character
4477040	4478380	who you're playing.
4478380	4480840	Let's take a listen.
4480840	4490560	This is actually my favorite game of the week too, which is why I picked that, and almost
4490560	4492920	every other sample of it online was horrible.
4492920	4501640	So, moving forward, you basically play as a virtualoid, you know, a giant robot controlled
4501640	4508160	by a person, which is actually pretty funny because there are little insert things where
4508160	4513000	the pilots go in the back of the month for Saturn, and the sequel, Virtual On, or Tario
4513000	4519280	Tangrum, was a dreamcast, which I have that game too, and I thought that was cool.
4519280	4525400	You would play as a number of different specialties, like you have the Temjin, which is the balanced
4525400	4535360	one, you have the Raiden, which is a heavy battle, one really strong and heavily armed,
4535360	4545160	you have the Ampharm, which is one of the fast ones, it uses a tonko weapon, you have
4545160	4554240	the Belgor, which is a missile launcher, the Dorcas, which is another pretty heavy one,
4554240	4560920	the Viper 2, the Basbalbo, and my favorite, which is the Fayen, which is like the cute
4560920	4566040	squirrel, the Kometa, which is really fast and nice, you have the Zeegratt, and then
4566040	4572520	you have the Jaguarade, which is, as far as I remember, I think it was one of the hidden
4572520	4573520	ones.
4573520	4578720	But in the arcade, you had a 2% set up, and it had a dividing wall in between, so you
4578720	4585840	were like in the cockpit, and it used two sticks to control it, and on Saturn they did
4585840	4591040	release the twin sticks, and I actually don't have them, which makes me very upset because
4591040	4597560	I had a chance to get them, they did do an oratorio tangram that was on the Dreamcast,
4597560	4603040	I actually do have the twin sticks for that, in fact, you remember your ex-roommate?
4603040	4606960	We beat him getting them.
4606960	4618720	We went to a place that's no longer in business in Sacramento, and the guy who sold it to
4618720	4629000	us ended up being, I do believe, Mo's manager.
4629000	4634200	You know, I know, we're not helping those stereotypes about Sacramento being a cow town.
4634200	4639040	But at any rate, we came in, we saw the twin sticks for 45 bucks, which was astounding
4639040	4643200	at that time, and like, we want to buy these right now, and I was like, okay.
4643200	4652040	And then a person who's, as far as I knew, his nickname came from this game, came in
4652040	4654080	and we beat him by like 10 minutes.
4654080	4658340	So there were also other versions, there was Cyber Troopers Virtual on Force that was only
4658340	4667520	in Japanese arcades in 2001, and Virtual on Mars, which was the PS2 release, so.
4667520	4672000	There's also an audio drama for it, which is kind of funny.
4672000	4677720	And then there was a musical one, which was the Fei-Yen robot singing, I actually have
4677720	4681200	a Fei-Yen garage kit that I still have yet to put together that I bought like six years
4681200	4682200	ago.
4682200	4683200	Nice.
4683200	4686040	Virtual on's like, tops.
4686040	4691360	All right, well, that's going to do it, your classic game of the week, Virtual on, here
4691360	4694560	on Orange Lawn's radio, and on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a break,
4694560	4698880	it is the end of part A. That's right, it's not a short show this week, we're all here,
4698880	4703080	it's like you're finally getting a full OLR, now it's like three weeks later after Jamie
4703080	4707500	being sick, us having no show and then having a short show, the month of February was screwed,
4707500	4712880	but there's plenty more of regular, good old fashioned, hopefully unbroken OLR left to
4712880	4714320	go.
4714320	4717600	Lots of stories coming up in part B, if you thought part A was PlayStation heavy, which
4717600	4721360	it was, because there was a lot of PlayStation news this week, which hopefully those people
4721360	4725400	that email us every now and then say, you don't show Sony enough love, you guys hate
4725400	4729000	Sony, blah blah blah, hopefully we proved you wrong tonight, we have plenty of Sony
4729000	4732760	stories tonight, but in the next segment, lots of Nintendo news came out as well, so
4732760	4736500	we'll be getting all the Nintendo news in the next segment, and some other randomness,
4736500	4739440	such as, what is the guy that created Pong up to now?
4739440	4740620	You might be surprised.
4740620	4743280	So we're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back with more of Orange
4743280	4745840	Lounge Radio, right after this.
4745840	4748000	Orange Lounge Radio.
4748000	4753440	Hi guys, it's Rob here with an important footnote for our podcast listeners.
4753440	4759120	There's no easy way for me to break the news, but part B this week was lost, and unfortunately
4759120	4762480	won't be hitting the podcast feed, and you won't get that news, we promised, unless you
4762480	4766160	were listening live and heard all two hours of it being taped.
4766160	4768000	So I'm sure you're wondering, what happened?
4768000	4771600	Well, what happened is that we were taping the show, so we always do, and we do a special
4771600	4775480	little show after that called The Afterbirth, it's only for the live listeners, and because
4775480	4779840	we play licensed music and stuff that we can't put on the podcast, and as we were taping
4779840	4784360	that, right at the very end, we were trying to unjumble some of the cords back here, and
4784360	4790920	the power cord to the computer got detached, and the whole damn thing shut off, and although
4790920	4796040	Audition keeps a temporary file on hand, when I went in to recover the file, I made a mistake
4796040	4799640	and ended up deleting the damn files, I was trying to make a backup copy of it, and I've
4799640	4804160	tried everything, I can't get, it's not in the recycle bin, pick the chatroom's brain
4804160	4808860	on it, it's gone, it ain't coming back, so I'm very sorry, and Justin, I was thinking
4808860	4811080	March wouldn't be as broken as February.
4811080	4815480	Anyhow, I guess one silver lining to this is that if you do want to hear Part B, it
4815480	4819880	is still archived on the Justin TV channel, so you can go to Justin.tv slash Orange Launch
4819880	4822560	Radio, and I believe some of our listeners are trying to make a highlight of the show
4822560	4829120	right now, now it's become this big lost archive of the show, it's like a collector's item
4829120	4830320	of sorts.
4830320	4834200	We will try to get an audio rip of that, we're probably not going to put it on the podcast
4834200	4839420	feed because the audio quality on Justin.tv is not great, our microphones don't hook into
4839420	4844000	that, it simply goes to our webcam, and the audio is really not great, we'll probably,
4844000	4847180	if anything, if we can get an audio rip of that, we'll probably put it on MySpace, Facebook
4847180	4851100	and all that stuff, unfortunately Part A is all the podcast listeners are going to get
4851100	4856260	this week, I am so sorry, in six years that we've been doing this show, we've never lost
4856260	4863280	a show like that, so it's kind of embarrassing and a little sad, especially off of a few
4863280	4868080	broken weeks in a row, but what can you do, life goes on, I hope everybody has a wonderful
4868080	4872400	week, happy gaming, and we'll see you next time with episode number 270 next week, with
4872400	4888960	all new power chords in studio, have a good one.
