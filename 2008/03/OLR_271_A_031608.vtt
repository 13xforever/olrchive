Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, March 16th, 2008, Tetris and Bomberman are WiiWare bound,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
E! Amuse hits the DDR scene in North America,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
and are the rumors about a Blu-ray drive on the 360 true?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that program on the internet, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week, also here with you every week, the one and only, Dark Sakura.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Jamie Summers.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hi.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
How are you, Miss Summers?

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm completely enamored with what I'm looking at.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
What are you looking at, Preto?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
A melodica.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
A melodica. Are you shopping for musical instruments online tonight?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yes, I am.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
Did last week's techno didgeridoo inspire you to come up with an underappreciated instrument of your own?

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Well, I actually have, there's a few instruments that I personally want to own myself.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
One of them is a melodica, which is like a keyboard, but you play it like, with the mouthpiece.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Nice.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
And so it sounds sort of like a harmonica, but not quite.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
I also want an autoharp.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Fun.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Because I used to play autoharp when I was little.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
What about Kazoo? Does Kazoo not satisfy anyone anymore? Is that the problem?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Not really.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
My wife autoharps.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Say hello to the smartass over there, Tech Master Loki.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Hi.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
So your wife autoharps, huh?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yes.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
That's nice to know.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I don't have to tell her to complain at all. She just does it on her own.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
How are you? Oh, I get it. There's a joke in there.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And how are you otherwise this week, Tech Master Loki?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm okay.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Excellent. Are you shopping for any musical instruments of your own?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
No.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay. Just checking.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Okay, well, let's get into how we always start off the show.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
First, let me introduce the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
There's several people in chat tonight.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Kind of a smaller turnout, though, on the live stream than I've seen in recent weeks, so I'm not sure.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Is there something else going on tonight I'm not aware of?

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
No more Grammy Awards? No Oscars? No Super Bowl?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
It's, I guess...

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Go outside night?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
St. Patty's Eve, I don't know.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Oh, maybe people are camping out outside the bars waiting for 6 a.m. I don't know.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
All right, well, who knows?

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
Anyhow, we'll work with what we've got and also our little contingent over on Justin TV on our feed there,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
which, by the way, brand new addition to our Justin TV arsenal.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
We now have a video capture card, so when we bring you clips of games,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
we'll actually, instead of having to point the camera at the TV, the little getaway,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
we'll actually be able to run the feed from the TV.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
That's very exciting. Happy, happy, happy.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
All right, so anyhow, let's get into how we always start off the show.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
How was your gaming week?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off? How was your gaming week?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
My week was pretty sparse just because I've been so busy all week,

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
so all I played was Ragnarok, and we actually had to play a little pinball,

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
but we have a purchase that might be coming up in our game future.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Good time. What's that?

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Stern is releasing a new Indiana Jones pinball machine,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
and Dan said he'd even be willing to sell Creature of the Black Lagoon to obtain it.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Nice. So that's going to be expensive, though, a new machine?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
A brand new machine.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
You guys are crazy.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, he said he might even let go since his pinball party.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Wow. But, I mean, it is an Indiana Jones machine. That is kind of awesome.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
It's a new Indiana Jones machine.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
That is kind of awesome.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
We actually have the old one in our garage right now.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
I imagine it's to coincide with the new Kingdom of the Crystal Skull movie?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I do believe so. That would be quite likely.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Nice. That would be fun.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
The pinball rules.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Anything else besides pinball and that stuff?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Ragnarok.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Ragnarok.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
And Scrabble.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Have you been playing the Scrabble game on Facebook?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I don't go on Facebook.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Facebook has a very Scrabble-like game. In fact, I think they got in trouble for it.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
It's actually an application called Scrabulous, is what it's called.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
You can play Scrabble with friends on Facebook, basically.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
And as much as Facebook kind of bugs me, I do like being able to play Scrabble with friends online.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I don't know if it's the same one.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
It was something that was linked to me.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
But I was doing the Solitaire mode on it.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm pretty sure you have to be a Facebook member to use Scrabulous, so it was probably something different.

04:42.000 --> 04:52.000
I have a Facebook, but the last thing I actually did with it was through my phone when one of my friends in Mississippi found me in Facebook somehow and friended me.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
You know, Jamie, I was just going to mention that I saw this earlier today than I thought of you guys.

04:56.000 --> 05:08.000
Street Fighter IV, they're taking pre-orders on it right now. It's $2,590 with an $880 deposit for the arcade hardware.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh, for the machine? I was like, for the game? Oh.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Hmm.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
But what kind of machine do you have to put that in?

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, normally the machines are $23,000.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
So, I mean, it's probably, you know, but, I mean, come on, 2DX?

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
I mean, shit, that's just like a computer with an HD screen attached to it and a sound system.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
So, I mean, most of these things nowadays, you can probably hook it up to a TV and build your own control panel for it.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I don't think it's too sophisticated.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I mean, it's just a game.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
You just have to be able to run the...

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah. It's just a game.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
I mean, games, arcade games, haven't really changed too much as far as, like, okay, put coin in, you know, control panel, monitor.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
That's it. Hooking that stuff up isn't that hard.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
It's still not like where you could get one of those super guns and just hook it up to it, but, you know.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Well, let me know if you end up doing that, Jamie. That's pretty hardcore, but then again...

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I doubt it.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
But then again, I'm like, well, you are going to buy that Indiana Jones pinball machine.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Dan was talking about buying it.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Okay. Talking and doing are two different things. That is true.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I know, and he talks a lot.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Big talker.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I mean, wait.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, let's move on then to Loki before Dark Soccer gets yourself in trouble.

06:22.000 --> 06:33.000
And I was going to say too, it says apparently it comes with a Street Fighter IV network ID card and some versus communication kit.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
So you can actually play other people online using your kit if you bought it.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
I don't know. If I only have $3,000 to throw around, of course I don't.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I probably wouldn't spend it on Street Fighter IV because I suck at Street Fighter.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Anyways.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
What?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
You know what I would do if I had that much money?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Make a down payment on a house and move.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
You're going to need more than $3,000 for a down payment.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I was thinking, like, the cost of the cabinet.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Ah. Well, $23,000. I would cover it.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Now, this week I didn't play a whole lot. I just played basically N+.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
A few lunches I played that.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
So it's fun. It's just like N. I think I'm on the 10th level.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
But there's like 5 or 6 stages per level.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Some of them are pretty hard, but that's N.

07:24.000 --> 07:35.000
And then the rest of the time I've been playing Smash Bros., but I've just basically been doing the Space Emissary mode, which is varying levels of cool and crap.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I don't know.

07:36.000 --> 07:44.000
Sometimes I'm just like, oh, this is pretty good level design, and some other times it's just like, uhhh, I don't know, this is pretty dumb.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
But, overall, I'm still playing it and I'm only halfway through it.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Actually, a little over halfway through it.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
But, other than that, I don't know. It's pretty good.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
How was N+, overall?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
That's what some folks in chat are asking.

08:03.000 --> 08:14.000
N+, I like it, but it's not too different than just the regular N, except for the fact that, I don't know, different levels.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
That's it.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Alright, well, moving on to my gaming week.

08:20.000 --> 08:28.000
I've actually been kind of sick this week, which you would think would make me want to stay home and play a lot of games, but it kind of sucked my will to do a lot of things.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I've been having these weird pains all over my side.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Now I want to get into all the nasty details about it.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
Basically, doctors don't even know what it is, and I've taken medications that have caused, now, side effects, blah, blah, blah.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
It kind of sucks.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
So, yeah, I didn't play a lot of games because of it.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I did play a few things.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Very random stuff.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Some of the things I played were very random.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I played Phantasy Star 2.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
I decided to download on Virtual Console quite randomly, and I checked that out, and that was kind of cool.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
Although, I don't know, Phantasy Star 2 wasn't quite as cool as Final Fantasy, but it was different.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
It was kind of cool.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
This is one of those games, because I never had a Genesis growing up, so it was kind of one of those games I missed.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
It's kind of neat, though, now that I've played Phantasy Star online, to kind of see some of the history of the Phantasy Star universe and see where a lot of that stuff has come from.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
So, that's kind of cool.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Let's see, what else have I checked out?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
World of Warcraft, as always.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Addict and all that stuff.

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
Let's see, what else have I played this week?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I'm totally drawing a blank.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I actually skipped out on Lost Odyssey this week.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh, I checked out Brain Challenge, that new Xbox Live arcade game.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
It was kind of dumb.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
The minigames were kind of dumb.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
The minigames were just kind of...

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I don't know.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
I guess if you don't have Brain Age on the DS, or I don't know, the whole novelty of these brain training games has really worn off, let's face it.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
The market's been really oversaturated.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
I guess this is the only type of it available on the Xbox 360.

10:01.000 --> 10:11.000
If you must have a minigame collection for your very own on the Xbox 360, then you can go ahead and check that out.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
But, honestly, it's really nothing to scream about.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
So, that would be that.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
That's really it for my gaming week.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
All right, so moving on to housekeeping this week.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
Not a lot that we have to say for housekeeping this week, other than, of course, as always, you can join our LiveJournal community.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
At Orange Lounge is our LiveJournal community, or our MySpace is at Orange Lounge Radio.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Of course, we have our Facebook community, the OL Army.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
You can join the social network and help pour out OLR to all your friends and your enemies, if you so choose.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
But, of course, word of mouth is how we always spread the word about our show, so we always thank folks who choose to do that.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
All right, we're having some technical problems in the studio right now, but hopefully things are on their way to being fixed.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
It's just that, man, 2008 is just year of broken over here, year of fail.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I don't know what's up with that.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
But, never mind, we're just going to try to proceed as normal.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
And, Loki, if we can, we're going to start off the gaming news.

11:06.000 --> 11:16.000
All right, so this week they officially announced that Super Mario Kart Wii will be coming to the U.S. on April 27th.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
That is, two days before Grand Theft Auto IV.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
But, hey, I mean, people on the Wii, they don't get Grand Theft Auto IV, so you get Mario Kart Wii.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
No cars being stolen in this game, but, you know, it's still pretty violent.

11:30.000 --> 11:39.000
Anyways, some other cool stuff that you'll, of course, get the Wii Wheel with this, and it will also be sold separately on the side.

11:39.000 --> 11:49.000
Apparently, they're going to have, you know, 32 different courses, up to 12 players online, and Mii integration, 10 battle arenas,

11:49.000 --> 11:58.000
and, of course, you know, support for a bunch of different control methods, much like Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So, that's pretty awesome.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I plan on picking up both, though.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
I noticed some of the retro levels are making an appearance in Mario Kart. That's kind of interesting.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
Some of them are pretty cool. IGN actually had some footage of five levels that they had in their pre-release copy.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
They're, I don't know what you'd call it, Alpha or whatever.

12:19.000 --> 12:27.000
And, they've got Course 4 from the Super Nintendo Mario Kart, and that's pretty awesome looking.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
Then, they had a remake of the Block Fort from Nintendo 64.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Although, it looks a little different, though. It's not just a direct, like, remake of it.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
They've got a bunch of additional stuff on there, but it's still, you know, Block Fort.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
And then, let's see, what else was there?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Some of the ones I didn't play, though.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
They had one from the Game Boy Advance one, which I don't remember any of the battle modes in the Game Boy Advance one.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
And, there's also some from, you know, Double Dash and the DS one.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
But, to be honest, you know, Double Dash's battle mode kind of blew, and a DS I didn't play.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
So, you know, at least the battle mode part of it.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
But, it's your favorite part. How could you say that?

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
It is my favorite part, but I was so jaded after Double Dash, you know, that I just decided not to check it out on DS.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Alright, well, let's read some feedback in the chat room.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
chat.orangeslaundryator.com, and we'll start off with a comment tonight from Jaded.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
It says, between that and Brawl, I can say goodbye to my bank account.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I'm probably going to mispronounce this name, I apologize.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Queltipo? I think that's how I say it, Queltipo?

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
It says, the Wii wheel is about as useful as jamming the Wiimote into a giant pretzel.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
And, you can do that, too, as long as the pretzel is sideways.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
You can actually use a pretzel as a Wii steering wheel.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
We should do that on the show, that'd be fun.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
That might be kind of fun.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I was going to say, one thing that's not...

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
And delicious.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
And delicious, yeah. Mmm, yummy!

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
I'm going to do that.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
We can also do, like, the Wii Cinnabon and, you know, alternate controller methods.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
That'd be sticky.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
That would be kind of messy.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Use a hamburger bun. It's circular.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
I was going to say, one thing that's not coming, though, to Mario Kart Wii is snaking.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
And I know that I'm very happy about that.

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
Apparently, according to the official Nintendo magazine in the UK, snaking is gone.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
They've changed how the boosting is done, I guess, around corners.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
And no longer will you be able to speed boost by waggling the controls left and right as you power slide.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
This has, I guess, been scrapped, and now your speed boost is determined by how long you can hold the slide.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I'm sure someone will find a different way to do it.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I'm sure it'll be exploited one way or another.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
But, hey, that's kind of neat.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
Of course, now, you know how our chat room works, and a little joke comes up, and then everybody exploits it best they can.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
We've got Wii Chiro, Wii Tortilla, Wii Hot Dog Bun.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
That actually kind of... Wii Hot Dog Bun?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
That worked.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
For Mario Kart controls.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
What else did I want to read here?

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
SSG100Matt says, Mario Kart Wii looks like it's ripped from the arcade version.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
I kind of hope not, because the arcade version, I don't know, it just doesn't have that same feel to me.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
The arcade version feels, I don't know, it feels stripped of the magic.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
So I take all the magic out of Mario Kart and you have the arcade version.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I don't know how to explain it.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
You would think Mario Kart arcade would be, like, best thing ever, but it feels so generic when I play it.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I don't know.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Is it just me?

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
The only thing that was cool about that was the feature to take your picture.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
But, obviously, they can't do that in, you know, on the Wii, because one, they don't have a camera, and two...

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Well, that we know of.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I mean, it might be one of those things where, hey, guess what?

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
The Wii had a secret compartment the whole time that's been taking your picture.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
It has, like, you know, then there'd be ass faces, you know, for racing in a Mario Kart.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
I see what you did there.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
A little joke from last week.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I got it.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
All right.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
Again, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelauncetradio.com.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
You know, Mario Kart Wii isn't the only thing to get excited about this year if you're a Nintendo fan.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
Reggie Fils-Aime is dropping some hints that there's a big holiday game coming out this year.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Of course.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I mean, obviously, every company's got to have their big holiday game.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
It will be revealed at this year's E3.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
That's right.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
He mentioned this in an interview with Jeff Keighley on Game Trailers TV.

16:28.000 --> 16:36.000
He says that the second half of 08's lineup will be announced at E3, which will probably include this year's big holiday title.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Who knows?

16:37.000 --> 16:44.000
Some things that Reggie was asked about, the orchestra conductor demo.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
Remember that thing you saw at the very first E3 where the Wii showed up, which was the last E3 most of us went to?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, Wii Music.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Yeah.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Don't know if that's actually going to be a full game yet.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
I mean, we did hear about that Wii Music game, but there was never any word if the conductor thing was a part of that.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
It is, yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Oh, is it?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah, that's the game.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Oh, well, they asked him, Reggie, point blank about this, and Reggie said,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Who knows? Maybe that's one of the things we'll talk about at E3.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Kind of dodging the question.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Lame!

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
He also dodged a question about Donkey Kong Wii.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
No, thanks.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
I'm sorry, Donkey Kong Bunga Blast sucked enough.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I don't need another Donkey Kong game.

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
Reggie did say that all the E3 releases, or actually, sorry, post-E3 releases, will be, quote, maximizing all of our key franchises.

17:28.000 --> 17:35.000
So you can bet it's going to be either like an F-Zero game, the Animal Crossing game, which most people are speculating.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I would bet it's the Animal Crossing game. It's going to be their big holiday title.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
That's what I think.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
And what other big franchises have they still got a milk?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Kirby?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
They haven't really milked Kirby on the Wii yet, have they?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
No.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
They did milk Kirby on the DS, but not yet.

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
I think there's going to be some type of Animal Crossing that will have some nifty little online feature that's going to make everybody want it.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I say Animal Crossing Wii is their big title.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
They better fucking release Excite Truck 2.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
What if F-Zero was kind of Excite Truck-ish?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
It's not.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
I'm sorry, that's like saying wipeouts, you know, like, Excite Truck.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
It's not.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It's just, eh.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
It's too hard.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Dark Sakura, any thoughts on what the big title could be?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I was thinking about it.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
And I am leaning toward Animal Crossing?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Mm-hmm.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Or possibly a Donkey Kong?

18:25.000 --> 18:34.000
The problem that I had, because he said it's for the gamers, which makes you kind of think it might be something for more hardcore gamers, but also something that people would like to get into and stuff.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
Animal Crossing, not really for the hardcore gamers, but that sounds feasible that they would do that.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
And every single Animal Crossing game I've ever heard of has always come out around that time of the year.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
So, you know, that'd be my guess.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
And because they're whores like that and they would want to do that.

18:51.000 --> 19:03.000
And now, especially once we get to that point in, you know, when that game is released, they'll have a perfect service for downloadable content and microtransactions and ooh, we can pour the hell out of that.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Yep, yep.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I'll tell you my Dark Horse candidate, though.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
The game that, you know, maybe it's just hope that this would be their big announcement.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
But I would say my Dark Horse candidate for the holiday game would be Kid Icarus on Wii.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
But I don't know, I mean...

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I think that's coming, but I don't think that's going to be it.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I have a feeling it's going to come back.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I mean, it just worked so well in Smash Brothers.

19:26.000 --> 19:33.000
And like, I mean, you watch some of those cinematics and play some of those stages and you're like, God damn, they could put out a Kid Icarus game on the Wii and it would be awesome.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
So, or as Act F says in chat, Kid Week-er-us.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
New Mario RPG, that would be fucking awesome.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
We'll see.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Let's see, some other comments from chat.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
Devay in chat says, Microsoft took all the DK platformer game rights after they purchased Rare.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Odd1 says, yeah, it's probably Animal Crossing.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
They said at the end of the anime movie that it'd be coming.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
And it's also kind of one of those obvious things, like, someday there will be another Zelda game and another Mario game.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
I just wish, though, that Nintendo would come up with a new franchise.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I'm all down with that, too.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I think they should come up with a new franchise.

20:10.000 --> 20:22.000
Because it's nice, you know, that we get a new Mario game and a new Metroid game, but it's like, you know, you take all the surprise out of things because we know that there's going to be, every time you're going to put out a new system, there's obviously going to be a Mario game and that kind of stuff.

20:22.000 --> 20:30.000
But, you know, it's like with, what, the PlayStation stuff, I guess there's always going to be a new Ratchet and Clank and that kind of crap, but I don't know.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Yeah, to be fair, Nintendo does seem to put out a few original IPs that do rather well.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
I mean, let's see, they had the Donkey Kong bongo game, Pikmin.

20:39.000 --> 20:47.000
They had, what else, I'm trying to think of the GameCube era that came out, I guess not Luigi's Mansion, I don't know.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
But, you know, I don't know. I think it's possible for them to come up with some new stuff.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I mean, they've done it before.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
WarioWare? Was that on GameCube? No, that started on Game Boy Advance, didn't it?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
That was fun on GameCube, wasn't it?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
It was pretty fun on the GameCube.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
But, I mean, they're capable of churning out some new stuff once in a while when they really want to.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Wii Sports 2.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
We're going to whore that franchise like a bitch.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Well, Wii Sports is kind of a new IP, right?

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
That could be a holiday title too, why not Wii Sports 2?

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
You know the soccer moms across America would eat that shit up.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Because they're going to whore it like a bitch, I'm trademarking that.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
Alright, well, we'll see at this year's E3.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, for things that we said we would stop and wait and see on.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
It looks like Manhunt 2 is getting a UK release after all.

21:35.000 --> 21:44.000
According to the BBFC, they have no alternative but to give the 18 certificate to it.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Because, basically, I guess they were overruled.

21:48.000 --> 21:57.000
It was actually twice rejected and it went up for review again and they said, okay, we have to.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
So they finally just caved?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Pretty much.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
That's kind of interesting.

22:02.000 --> 22:13.000
It was actually, the video appeals committee gave it their own review and so because they've decided it should come out, it's going to come out.

22:13.000 --> 22:26.000
You know, I guess I'm not too surprised by this but what kind of makes me think that maybe they finally decided to let it come out is maybe they saw what happened in America is that the game came out and nobody cared because the game kind of sucked.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Maybe.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
I'm wondering if that didn't have an influence on it where they're like, well, I don't think it's really going to pollute the masses because the game kind of sucks.

22:33.000 --> 22:42.000
No, they said that they were very unhappy with the appeal but they were basically strong armed into it.

22:42.000 --> 22:51.000
I saw that they had a modified version for the Wii in case you have a mod ship and stuff with all the, you know, blurring crazy lighting gone.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Whatever.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Too bad the game sucks and, you know, it's not worth playing.

22:55.000 --> 23:04.000
Do we have any, I know we don't have a whole lot of overseas listeners that listen live but are there any of our overseas listeners planning on purchasing this game overseas?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
I bet I'm going to hear a lot of no's.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
You don't want it.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Do yourself a favor.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
But there's no release date announced for it yet.

23:09.000 --> 23:18.000
If you want to see something like, if you want to play a game kind of like that, I guess, and more fun, maybe try the Godfather game and maybe No More Heroes.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Or just wait for something better.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
There you go.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Even better.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Something better.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
I like that.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Something better, the game.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
That could be the new Nintendo IP.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Something better.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Something better.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
You're going to buy it.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Yeah.

23:31.000 --> 23:39.000
So we may be getting WiiWare in May but of course Japan being super awesome and everything.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
They get it March 25th and they're going to be launching with quite a few games.

23:44.000 --> 23:57.000
Right now they've got, of course, some of these I don't think we're getting but Okiraku Ping Pong Wii by Arc System for 500 points.

23:57.000 --> 24:06.000
Word puzzle Mojipitan Wii for 1,000 points and I hear that one also has microtransactions too for little bonus puzzles that you can buy.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Oh, hooray.

24:07.000 --> 24:13.000
Sakusaku Animal Panic by Konami for 1,000 points.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Star Soldier...

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Wait, 4,000 points?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
1,000 points.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh, I thought you said 4,000.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
I'm like, fuck that.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Ain't worth buying that.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Ok.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
Star Soldier R by Hudson for 800 points.

24:25.000 --> 24:32.000
My Life as a King Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for 1,500 points.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Angel Solitaire by G-Mode for 500 points.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
Dr. Mario and Baculous Extermination for 1,000 points.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
I love that name.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Sounds painful.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Baculous.

24:45.000 --> 24:53.000
Everybody's Pokemon Ranch for 1,000 points and Long Puss by Genki for 1,000 points.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Sounds not bad.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
I don't know.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I'm kind of looking forward to the service.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
It'll be interesting to see what kind of games are on there.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
When are we supposed to be getting that here?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Did they say May?

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
It was like May 20 something.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I think May 20th or around that time.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
So what's so special about these games?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
What's going to make me want to purchase them?

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
I mean, what's interesting about it is that you won't really be able to play a demo.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Well, I don't know.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
I guess we don't really know until the service launches in Japan what kind of secrets might be waiting, but you don't really get to play demos of the games.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Assuming it runs like Virtual Console, you don't get to really play a demo of the games.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
You don't really play any of these games online with other people.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Or is that slowly going to be coming out?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
You might be able to. I'm not sure.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
And there's no achievements or leaderboards or anything we're hearing about.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
What's the perk to get these games?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
They're just more games.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
I guess.

25:44.000 --> 25:51.000
I mean, I guess maybe that's a stupid question because a lot of games that you might buy on the PC and stuff don't have a lot of those types of frills.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Especially the casual-type games.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
But, you know, I don't know.

25:54.000 --> 26:02.000
I think now in this day and age, part of the charms of having the online connections and online gaming is getting to somewhat compete with friends.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
I really don't like the way that Nintendo handles their online, especially the friend stuff, the friend codes.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
That's got to go.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Well, we'll see.

26:10.000 --> 26:16.000
I mean, when the service actually launches in Japan, which is very, very soon, only about a week away.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Actually, we should know more details on next week's show, right?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Because they're a day ahead in Japan.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I would think so, yeah.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
So we should know more next week's show.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
Except today's the 16th and that would be the 23rd.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Oh, wait.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
I can't do math.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
I'm sorry.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Okay, then two weeks.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Two weeks will know more details.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
All right.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
Well, in the meantime, we do know some more details about some of the other games that will be coming out on the WiiWare.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
One of them is Tetris.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
Tetris Online will be coming on the WiiWare and you can play it with up to six players.

26:48.000 --> 26:56.000
And I'm guessing since it's a matchup with Tetris Online, I'm guessing you can play up to six players online.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
I'm looking at these screenshots, I see two different Miis.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
Well, you would have to be able to play up to six players online since the Wii can only support up to four.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Oh, snap.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Well, technically you could do five because remember, was it Bomberman?

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
You could do the fifth one with the GameCube controllers, yeah.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
So I'm assuming, yeah, some of these games are going to be online, which is a little better now.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
So if you need another version of Tetris, you'll be able to play that on the Wii very soon.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
One thing I want to point out, though, based on some of these screenshots I'm looking at that's kind of cool,

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
I'm looking at one particular two-player mode and it looks like the wells aren't separated.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
It actually looks like the wells are combined into one giant well.

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
So I'm not sure if there's a two-player mode where maybe both players play one giant board at the same time.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
That's kind of interesting, a different spin on a well-known formula.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Yeah.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
It looks like this game might bring some new things to the table, which is a good thing.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
You need Puzzle Fighter Wii.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
I just asked about why I would need these types of games.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Puzzle Fighter Wii.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
That'd be awesome with like Street Fighter IV characters.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
You never know.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
RasteelUT comments in the chat room, chat.orangewoncholster.com.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
Ooh, Tetris, that's so new and independent.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
Well, in a way, if you think about the history of Tetris, it actually is a very independent game at its roots,

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
but I mean, I get the point.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Obviously, it's not that anymore.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
And people are still playing fucking Pac-Man Championship Edition.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
That's just Pac-Man with neon lights.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
I mean, that's all it fucking is.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
But Pac-Man Championship Edition is kind of rad.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
I don't know.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
There's something about it.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
And Pac-Man.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
It's neon lights and rave music.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
You know, all you need to do now is come out with like the Pac-Man DS system,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
and all you whores will buy it like nothing.

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
Darkdetsuya comments in the chat room that, Rob, they actually had that mode that I'm describing there on Tengen Tetris.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Remember the Forbidden Tetris on the NES many years ago?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
I have it.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
That got cut up on a licensing debacle?

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
That would be even a better name for this online version.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Forbidden Tetris.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Forbidden Tetris.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
I have Tengen Tetris.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Yeah?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Yes, I do.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
So you own Forbidden Tetris?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Yes, I do.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I want Tangram Tetris.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
That would be fascinating.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Whatever happened to the really shitty Tetris knockoffs we got?

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
Like, remember when Tetris got really popular like in the early 90s or so?

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
We got tons of just shitty, shitty ripoffs.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
We had Word-Tris and Hat-Tris and what else?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Face-Tris.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
But Blastris was real.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Well-Tris.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Tetris 2 Bomb Bliss.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
Blastris was fun because you could shoot things.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Shooting always makes things better, right?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
It was a Super Scope game.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Alright.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
That was what made it cool.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Alright, enough reminiscing, I'm sorry.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
Well, something else that is cool, and this is particularly cool for me, because I love

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Hudson, and they're bringing us a real Bomberman.

29:42.000 --> 29:50.000
Well, okay, it's for WiiWare, and it actually is real Bomberman.

29:50.000 --> 29:56.000
I mean, we're talking about up to eight players in one game, at least that's what Famitsu

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
says.

29:57.000 --> 30:04.000
It's going to be out in Japan in June, so hopefully we'll get it not too long, I hope.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
But it's Bomberman.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
I love Bomberman.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I know, and Bomberman's cool and all that.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
I don't know, maybe it's just me.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm a little burned out on Bomberman.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
How can you be burned out on Bomberman when all we've had are like little minigame crap

30:17.000 --> 30:23.000
and then that horrible, horrible, I'm going to be Bomberman, but I'm going to be hardcore.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Oh, Bomberman X-Zero?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
As in, piece of shit Bomberman.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
There was, and maybe that kind of just ruined Bomberman for me, like it's like watching

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
your childhood get raped right in front of your eyes.

30:33.000 --> 30:41.000
We still regularly break out the Super Nintendo and the MultiTap and play, you know, Bomberman

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
2, Super Bomberman 2.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
I'm thinking more of the recent Xbox Live one.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Remember how they had a Bomberman come out on Xbox Live, and it was pretty faithful to

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
the original?

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
I just, my resounding reaction to the game was, meh.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
But this is an actual new Bomberman, it's Hudson!

30:59.000 --> 31:07.000
Listen, Hudson, we play Bomberman on every system that's ever been made, ever, and then

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
some, and then you release four versions of it.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
Listen, I know that it might seem like a good idea to release a lot of these each year,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
because, you know, you need money.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
I understand that.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
But, at the same time, I don't know, other companies need to do the same thing, because,

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
fucking, fucking aye dude, how many Harvest Moon games do they really need to fucking

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
make?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I mean, they're really getting bad at that shit.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
There's like four games coming out each year now.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
I'd say more than four games.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
I mean, that's whoring.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
Okay, I'm reading something else on here on the actual Famitsu article.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Sure.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
And from what I can see, you can actually play as your me as a character in this game.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Oh, in that case, I gotta buy that.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
I sense that comment has a hint of sarcasm.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
Well, no, I'm picking, I'm just trying to pick out what I can actually read on this.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
That is kind of cool, to be honest.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
I think that is an interesting feature.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
I don't know why.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
Can I mail away for an actual bomb, like, piece of plastic that I can put on my Wii

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
remote so that, you know, I can pretend I'm the real Bomberman, and look at me, I have

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
a bomb controller.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
It's also saying something in here about you're getting a whole bunch of extra bonus items

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
and bomb upgrades.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
You know, the usual stuff, it looks like there's some new stuff in here, and there's also,

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
it looks like, more area effect bombs on here, too.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
I was just reading this over.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
DarkSakura, somebody is in your fan club in chat.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Somebody is on your side here.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Odd1 in chat says, Bomberman is like Metal Slug.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I only want more, damn it.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Yes, okay.

32:46.000 --> 32:53.000
Okay, how, how, you, you know that if I really like a game, I tend to like the entire series

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
of it, no matter how much repetition it has, which makes me really pissed off that they

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
haven't done another bus to move and we just got dance on it.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
It's people like you that will make SNK constantly release the same damn game over and over and

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
over again.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
It's people like me that keep SNK in business.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
Yeah, seriously, because if people smarten it up and say, hey, wait a second, didn't

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
I buy this like four times already, that, you know.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
Well, maybe they'll actually bring out the sequels that I want, which I'll get into later

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
in the show.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
Here's my suggestion, though, for how to make Bomberman a little more appealing to

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
people like me.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Forbidden Bomberman.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
He's on to something.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
In blood effects.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
I'm telling you.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
I want blood effects.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
God damn, I'm working on the wrong side of gaming.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I shouldn't be bitching about games like I do on the show.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I should be making games.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Okay.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Show of hands in chat.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Forbidden Bomberman, Y or N. Listen, here's what you need to do, okay.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
This is a small bit of innovation, and it's ripping a little bit off of Taito, but who

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
cares.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Bomberman, mixed with Rampage.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
You're blowing up cities, and you're fighting each other.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Who doesn't want that?

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
People like blowing things up, but they want a little bit more than just blowing up little

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
cartoon characters.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
We need to take out, like, cities.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
I like Rampage.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
We need to quit our damn jobs and start a gaming company.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
You are on a goldmine here.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Bomberman mixed with Rampage.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Genius.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Forbidden Bomberman.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.560
Who doesn't like to blow up cities full of innocent people?

34:15.560 --> 34:16.560
In games.

34:16.560 --> 34:17.780
Only in game form.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.140
Not in real life.

34:19.140 --> 34:20.140
Just in game form.

34:20.140 --> 34:22.120
Just great stress reliever.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.120
Bomberman Rampage.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.640
Alright.

34:25.640 --> 34:26.880
Anyhow.

34:26.880 --> 34:34.400
If Bomberman's not your type of game, then maybe this brand new game called Oichi De

34:34.400 --> 34:39.760
Puti Puti, which, I know that sounds retarded, and it is kind of retarded.

34:39.760 --> 34:44.800
It's actually a game based off of this toy that you can get, it's a keychain toy called

34:44.800 --> 34:51.400
Puti Puti, and what it does is it makes bubble wrap popping noises, and this whole game is

34:51.400 --> 34:53.000
popping bubble wrap.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.360
Yes, they really want you to pay eight dollars, or eight hundred Wii points, to buy a game

34:59.360 --> 35:01.840
that you pop bubble wrap.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.600
I want it.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.600
It's pretty.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.600
Pretty dumb!

35:05.600 --> 35:09.260
No, I was looking at the backgrounds and stuff, that's actually kind of pretty.

35:09.260 --> 35:10.260
Game bubble wrap.

35:10.260 --> 35:11.260
Awesome.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.260
You know.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.260
I have bubble wrap at my house.

35:13.260 --> 35:14.260
How about the real thing?

35:14.260 --> 35:15.260
Like, I like popping real b-

35:15.260 --> 35:18.900
This is, honestly, this reminds me of when I went to Barnes and Noble like ten years

35:18.900 --> 35:22.960
ago and found a big thick book full of fat bubble wrap.

35:22.960 --> 35:27.660
I'm not joking, and it was called Stress Relief Book.

35:27.660 --> 35:30.280
I am not kidding.

35:30.280 --> 35:34.680
Are we sure there's not more to this, like maybe it just looks like it's a bubble wrap

35:34.680 --> 35:37.600
popping game, but maybe there's more to it that we just don't know about yet?

35:37.600 --> 35:38.600
I don't think so.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.560
Is that a bad translation thing gone wrong?

35:40.560 --> 35:41.560
I don't think so.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.640
It's put out by Namco Bandai, so.

35:43.640 --> 35:44.640
I mean, like-

35:44.640 --> 35:45.740
So Pac-Man's gonna come out and eat it.

35:45.740 --> 35:50.020
For less than that, though, I could go to See's Candies, because we all know the best

35:50.020 --> 35:53.040
part of See's Candy is that you get the little bubble wrap with everything you buy.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.280
I think that's California only.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.280
Is that only in California?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.280
I think so.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.280
Well then, you know what-

35:57.280 --> 35:58.280
I had never heard of See's until I moved out here.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.280
Okay, the national and international people can just deal for a minute here.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.120
California only for a minute here.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.400
It's like getting something in the mail.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.720
The best part of See's Candy is that you get a little piece of bubble wrap in the pack

36:07.720 --> 36:08.720
with the candy.

36:08.720 --> 36:09.720
I mean, think about it.

36:09.720 --> 36:14.200
For $10, I get a little box of candy, and not only do I have real bubble wrap to pop,

36:14.200 --> 36:17.160
but I also have- wait for it- candy!

36:17.160 --> 36:18.160
Hello!

36:18.160 --> 36:20.200
Here's the best part, though.

36:20.200 --> 36:27.280
There's 40 levels that you'll be able to play, and of course it features vibration feedback.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.280
Ooh.

36:28.280 --> 36:36.240
Yeah, and in fact, they have a little link here on asovision.com slash pooty pooty.

36:36.240 --> 36:46.000
You can watch a little movie of this stupid little bubble wrap thing, which- oh my god.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.920
You like- that's crazy looking.

36:47.920 --> 36:52.320
It looks like bubble wrap, but it's little buttons, and you pop them.

36:52.320 --> 36:53.320
It's for stress relief.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.400
It's bubble wrap that never wears out!

36:55.400 --> 36:58.560
I mean, that right there is genius.

36:58.560 --> 37:04.800
Amanda in chat is correcting me and says, the best part is that you get free samples.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.480
I forgot, every time you go into C's, they actually give you a free sample.

37:07.480 --> 37:08.480
Free is the best part.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.480
Let's see.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.920
Quelltippo, who has a name I'm probably still mispronouncing in chat, says, will it be like

37:12.920 --> 37:16.600
gals panic and after you pop the bubble wrap, you see a naked girl?

37:16.600 --> 37:24.720
No, this has a picture of T. Oh, hooray, a picture of T. Oh my god, this is great.

37:24.720 --> 37:25.720
I want one.

37:25.720 --> 37:26.720
Oh my god.

37:26.720 --> 37:29.240
And it looks like this website sells them in five different colors.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.040
White, blue, pink, orange, and black.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.720
Hell, we can sell orange ones.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.600
I want one to annoy people at work with.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.000
I'm totally going to get one.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.720
Well, let's talk about more incredibly awesome games that you can be spending your money

37:41.720 --> 37:44.520
on in the near future.

37:44.520 --> 37:52.160
There is a new game that is coming out on the DS, and it's called Babysitting Mania.

37:52.160 --> 37:56.760
It's actually a game that you can play on the PC right now.

37:56.760 --> 38:03.880
It's available at fenomengames.com, that's F-E-N-O-M-E-N dash G-A-M-E-S dot com.

38:03.880 --> 38:09.200
You can actually play a game called Babysitting Mania, and here's how they advertise it on

38:09.200 --> 38:10.200
the site.

38:10.200 --> 38:16.720
From the makers of Nanny Mania comes the all new hit, Babysitting Mania.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.460
Find out if you're the ultimate babysitter.

38:18.460 --> 38:23.180
What if you didn't expect was 20 of the craziest houses you've ever imagined being...

38:23.180 --> 38:28.600
And if the babies don't behave, then they get beat mania.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.260
Now now.

38:30.260 --> 38:31.760
That's not cool.

38:31.760 --> 38:36.920
Alright, uh, yeah, but apparently they're porting that to the DS.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.920
Why?

38:37.920 --> 38:40.400
Because there's money in them DS's.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.400
Apparently.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.400
Apparently.

38:42.400 --> 38:46.520
I think if one person buys it, they'll make back their budget.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.520
I guess.

38:48.520 --> 38:54.640
Well, anyway, how about something a little bit better, or maybe worse, depending on your

38:54.640 --> 39:00.440
opinion of certain characters in the Sonic franchise.

39:00.440 --> 39:06.560
Sonic RPG, of course, it's actually Sonic Chronicles, is coming out on the DS, and it

39:06.560 --> 39:12.720
has been confirmed that we are getting some of Sonic's buddies, especially Bill, I'm not

39:12.720 --> 39:15.880
saying Bill the Cat, Big the Cat.

39:15.880 --> 39:20.000
It's the same Bill the Cat, because, you know, we're coming up on election season.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.880
And I used to vote for Bill the Cat.

39:21.880 --> 39:24.640
And plus, Bill the Cat in the game would actually be kind of cooler, I'm sorry.

39:24.640 --> 39:29.400
He'd just walk around spitting on things, and hacking up hairballs, and then getting

39:29.400 --> 39:32.320
drunk with, I guess, hot naked chicks or something.

39:32.320 --> 39:40.920
But no, Big the Cat is definitely going to be in it, and it's of course being put out

39:40.920 --> 39:50.200
by Bioware, and people, basically the co-founder who they were interviewing, Ray, is it pronounced

39:50.200 --> 39:57.480
Musica, I guess, anyway, they actually asked him, you know, well, a lot of people don't

39:57.480 --> 40:01.760
like these characters, he's like, well, the whole point is to make you attach an emotion

40:01.760 --> 40:05.440
to the character, and dislike is an emotion.

40:05.440 --> 40:08.000
It's like, okay.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.320
Anyway, he says that all the characters are going to be really pivotal to the game, and

40:13.320 --> 40:18.880
it's not like a whole bunch of little mini-games, but something that's fully interactive, so.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.600
I guess, I don't know how I feel about that.

40:22.600 --> 40:27.440
I actually thought that Big's part of the game was the most annoying part of Sonic Avenger.

40:27.440 --> 40:30.840
Here, Froggy.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.480
It should stop making retarded Sonic characters.

40:33.480 --> 40:37.640
Like, Amy was cool, because she watched her own smack and stuff with a hammer.

40:37.640 --> 40:38.640
That was cool.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.200
Knuckles, cool.

40:40.200 --> 40:43.440
Mecha Sonic, really cool.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.480
But, no.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.760
Can I take the show on a completely random, unrelated tangent for just a minute?

40:49.760 --> 40:50.760
Oh, I know.

40:50.760 --> 40:51.760
I know what you're reading.

40:51.760 --> 40:52.760
That's the best thing.

40:52.760 --> 40:56.720
Here's the thing, when you were talking about build the cat, I started thinking about all

40:56.720 --> 40:58.000
these comic book cats, right?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.420
I'm like, oh, then there's like Felix the cat, and there's, oh, oh, you know, all these

41:01.420 --> 41:02.420
other cats, right?

41:02.420 --> 41:03.720
Felix the cat is great though.

41:03.720 --> 41:08.760
But then I thought about Garfield, and that made me think about Garfield minus Garfield.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.760
Have you seen this cartoon?

41:09.760 --> 41:11.400
Yes, I have.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.800
It's the best thing ever.

41:12.800 --> 41:13.800
They're more funny.

41:13.800 --> 41:14.800
Yeah, exactly.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.800
Because, like, Garfield's not funny.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.140
But if you take out Garfield, it's actually really funny.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.140
And there's this blog.

41:20.140 --> 41:22.000
All the ones with normal.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.800
There's this blog all about it.

41:23.800 --> 41:28.160
It's garfield minus garfield dot t-u-m-b-l-r dot com.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.920
Whatever happened to our website of the week segment?

41:30.920 --> 41:32.940
It became the classic video game of the week segment.

41:32.940 --> 41:33.940
You know what?

41:33.940 --> 41:38.840
We need to just, just for a minute here.

41:38.840 --> 41:42.600
I'm hijacking the website of the week segment.

41:42.600 --> 41:47.520
My website of the week is garfield minus garfield dot t-u-m-b-l-r dot com.

41:47.520 --> 41:48.520
Check it out.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.520
It's hilarity.

41:49.520 --> 41:52.120
Maybe you'll link it in the chat room for people.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.840
Oh, sure, I'll do that for you guys right now.

41:54.840 --> 41:55.840
Sorry live listeners.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.840
There you go.

41:56.840 --> 42:02.840
Anyway, sorry, there's your completely random off the subject tangent for tonight.

42:02.840 --> 42:06.640
There you go.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.160
Sorry.

42:08.160 --> 42:11.680
No, it's okay.

42:11.680 --> 42:17.320
Network problems, random tangents, sickness, this show has it all tonight.

42:17.320 --> 42:22.000
Before you broke off on that whole Garfield thing, I was starting to say that Sonic and

42:22.000 --> 42:27.720
his friends are kind of reminding me of Godzilla and the other monsters.

42:27.720 --> 42:31.360
They had the staple monsters that they made and then they just started getting ridiculous

42:31.360 --> 42:34.880
with the monsters, just not even trying.

42:34.880 --> 42:39.840
I'm sure that someday they'd have a giant guy in underwear with broccoli on his head

42:39.840 --> 42:43.080
or something like that and call it some fucking monster or whatever.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.560
That's how ridiculous it is to get him.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.200
Stop making Sonic characters and make some better Sonic games.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.640
Hopefully this one is a little bit better.

42:49.640 --> 42:50.640
I don't know.

42:50.640 --> 42:54.160
Broccoli Man sounds kind of funny.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.560
I mean, that's where the Mega Man series was going.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.720
Perfect example, perfect example.

42:59.720 --> 43:00.720
Broccoli Man.

43:00.720 --> 43:01.720
Right.

43:01.720 --> 43:13.680
Well, if you're on a weight loss kick like most of the people it seems like nowadays,

43:13.680 --> 43:15.760
then you'll be interested in this title.

43:15.760 --> 43:22.160
It's a game or I guess a piece of software for the DS called Might Weight Loss Coach

43:22.160 --> 43:27.800
and it features a pedometer that will actually plug into your Game Boy Advance slot.

43:27.800 --> 43:33.760
So basically you wear this pedometer around and it will actually track how much you're

43:33.760 --> 43:38.800
exercising throughout the day or how much you're jiggling I guess and then track your

43:38.800 --> 43:42.520
progress throughout the DS title.

43:42.520 --> 43:49.880
And I'm not sure if they also have some exercises or something that talks you through, but I

43:49.880 --> 43:53.220
guess that's kind of neat.

43:53.220 --> 43:54.220
Kind of.

43:54.220 --> 43:55.220
A little bit.

43:55.220 --> 43:56.220
I guess.

43:56.220 --> 43:59.200
It just shows the DS can do even more.

43:59.200 --> 44:05.440
Now it's a meter that you can measure how far you've walked in a day.

44:05.440 --> 44:06.440
Hooray.

44:06.440 --> 44:09.640
Well, the PSP users get this game called WTF.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.360
Have you ever played WTF?

44:11.360 --> 44:12.360
Uh-huh.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.360
It's kind of fun.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.360
I love WTF.

44:14.360 --> 44:18.880
Well, you get WTF on the PSP and now on the DS you're going to get LOL.

44:18.880 --> 44:19.880
That's right.

44:19.880 --> 44:20.880
Actually these two games are completely unrelated.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.800
They just both have funny titles.

44:22.800 --> 44:28.400
The DS is getting a game called LOL and it's being made by a company called H-Tech.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.580
They are bringing LOL to the Nintendo DS.

44:31.580 --> 44:36.960
Basically what happens, somebody in the room will write a challenge on their DS like for

44:36.960 --> 44:42.040
instance the screenshot I'm looking at says draw panda bear and then within a time limit

44:42.040 --> 44:47.640
everybody else in the room has to draw, it sounds like Pictionary to me, and then everybody

44:47.640 --> 44:50.040
votes on the winner and then you go to the next challenge.

44:50.040 --> 44:51.040
Okay.

44:51.040 --> 44:56.680
So at first this sounded cool because it reminded me a lot of apples to apples where you would

44:56.680 --> 44:58.880
do something like that.

44:58.880 --> 45:03.560
But then I just started looking at this and thinking about it, can't you do this already

45:03.560 --> 45:04.560
in PictoChat?

45:04.560 --> 45:10.520
I mean, couldn't you, I don't know, do the exact same thing just with a little egg timer?

45:10.520 --> 45:12.720
Or better yet, here's the thing.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.960
Here's how you can play LOL without even a Nintendo DS.

45:15.960 --> 45:18.880
It's called pen and paper.

45:18.880 --> 45:22.280
Whoa, so what do I need to do this?

45:22.280 --> 45:25.240
You would actually need to get some pens and some paper.

45:25.240 --> 45:28.480
Now can I use any type of pens or certain pens will work for this?

45:28.480 --> 45:31.880
Probably like a pen that would show up, like you wouldn't want to use a pink pen because

45:31.880 --> 45:35.080
that's kind of hard to see unless you want to go for LOL value.

45:35.080 --> 45:39.800
But make sure you have pen, and the paper, it could be lined paper or grid paper or blank

45:39.800 --> 45:40.800
paper.

45:40.800 --> 45:46.320
If people do insist on having it in a virtual environment, open Canvas.

45:46.320 --> 45:51.640
Hi, you can network on open Canvas and everyone can draw on the same picture.

45:51.640 --> 45:53.640
Now what do we need to do to get the word out about this pen and paper?

45:53.640 --> 45:54.640
That Yahoo!

45:54.640 --> 45:56.640
Chat thingy with the draw board is hilarious.

45:56.640 --> 45:59.600
Or freakin' Oikaki, do that.

45:59.600 --> 46:02.040
I really think you're onto something with this pen and paper.

46:02.040 --> 46:03.040
I'm not sure, though.

46:03.040 --> 46:04.040
I know, I'm telling you.

46:04.040 --> 46:08.280
Look, think of what OLR Productions has come up with in the scope of just a few weeks.

46:08.280 --> 46:12.960
We have Forbidden Bomberman, we have the pen and paper version of LOL, which we can totally

46:12.960 --> 46:18.120
undercut these guys putting it out on DS, and remember, we're the ones that thought

46:18.120 --> 46:19.840
of Laser Cats the game.

46:19.840 --> 46:20.840
True.

46:20.840 --> 46:24.300
I'm telling you, EA's going to buy us tomorrow.

46:24.300 --> 46:26.400
It's just a matter of time.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.400
Just a matter of time.

46:28.400 --> 46:32.240
And oh, how we'll sell.

46:32.240 --> 46:37.360
Let's have tea and chat says, pen and paper is the wave of the future.

46:37.360 --> 46:39.480
Yeah.

46:39.480 --> 46:49.480
So how about the wave of the future that is actually not necessarily in ours anytime soon?

46:49.480 --> 46:54.280
Guess who else is getting Wii Fit before us?

46:54.280 --> 46:55.280
Let's see.

46:55.280 --> 46:58.680
How about, I don't know, what's a country we don't hear about very often in the news?

46:58.680 --> 46:59.680
How about...

46:59.680 --> 47:00.680
Slovakia.

47:00.680 --> 47:01.680
Sure.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.940
How about the country of Chad in Africa?

47:03.940 --> 47:05.720
Is Chad getting the game before we are?

47:05.720 --> 47:07.560
No, but they're getting it in Australia.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.320
Chad ruined our elections.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.320
Same thing.

47:10.320 --> 47:11.320
Right?

47:11.320 --> 47:12.320
Chad, Australia.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.320
What's the difference?

47:13.320 --> 47:14.320
Australia is cool.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.320
I'm just kidding.

47:15.320 --> 47:16.320
I love Australia.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.320
Of course I do.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.160
And we did get Priscilla, Queen of the Desert from them.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.160
That's true.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.800
One of my favorite movies ever is Muriel's Wedding.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.320
I have to say.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.320
And Olivia Newton-John.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.320
Anyway.

47:26.320 --> 47:31.880
Although, I bet most people who live in Australia would tell us there's plenty more to appreciate

47:31.880 --> 47:33.840
about Australia than just those things.

47:33.840 --> 47:34.840
And they gave us Kylie.

47:34.840 --> 47:35.840
I don't know.

47:35.840 --> 47:36.840
The opera house.

47:36.840 --> 47:37.840
They did give us Kylie.

47:37.840 --> 47:38.840
They gave us Kylie.

47:38.840 --> 47:43.680
We had to test it on kangaroos before it's safe for Americans to use because we're very

47:43.680 --> 47:44.680
kangaroo-like.

47:44.680 --> 47:48.480
So, what's coming out in...

47:48.480 --> 47:50.800
And act deaf, hit the nail on the head.

47:50.800 --> 47:55.680
Without Australia, you would never have the dingo ate my baby.

47:55.680 --> 47:56.760
You would never have that.

47:56.760 --> 47:59.760
Or the didgeridoo techno.

47:59.760 --> 48:01.760
Exactly.

48:01.760 --> 48:06.720
Let's take a moment to salute our Australian fans and their history.

48:06.720 --> 48:07.720
Their great history.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.080
Thank you, Australia.

48:09.080 --> 48:10.080
For Moeller.

48:10.080 --> 48:11.080
Opera house.

48:11.080 --> 48:15.320
So, see, Australia, because of their greatness and contributions to culture, they get the

48:15.320 --> 48:16.320
game a little early.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.480
I thought that was very nice of Nintendo to do.

48:18.480 --> 48:19.480
Right.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.600
Well, anyway, they're getting it on May 8th.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.720
We're getting ours on May 19th.

48:23.720 --> 48:29.420
And it should be coming out for $150 Australian, which is...

48:29.420 --> 48:34.560
The equivalent is 140 here, or 91 euro.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.200
It's already sold over a million units.

48:36.200 --> 48:40.000
Our dollar went to shit, didn't it?

48:40.000 --> 48:43.560
Our dollar really, really went to shit sometime in the past couple years, didn't it?

48:43.560 --> 48:46.200
You know, if it gets any worse, we're going to have to start calling it pesos.

48:46.200 --> 48:47.200
Oh my God.

48:47.200 --> 48:48.200
Sorry.

48:48.200 --> 48:52.360
So, you know, I could go to Europe and I could work.

48:52.360 --> 48:58.720
I could go to Europe like people from Mexico come here to earn money and come back rich.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.200
That'd be great.

49:01.200 --> 49:05.880
Anyway, like I was saying, it's already sold over a million units in Japan.

49:05.880 --> 49:13.320
It's coming out on April 25th in Europe for 69.99 pounds in the UK and 89.99 euro everywhere

49:13.320 --> 49:15.400
else in Europe.

49:15.400 --> 49:19.280
And we're getting it on the 19th of May.

49:19.280 --> 49:24.160
So that gets the whatever award for me, but I don't know.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.800
Congratulations, Australia.

49:26.800 --> 49:32.040
You've beat out Europe and America.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.080
Kudos to you.

49:33.080 --> 49:36.120
We're just trying to make it fair, I guess.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.120
I don't know.

49:37.120 --> 49:38.120
Karpat can ask a question.

49:38.120 --> 49:40.040
What is the capital of Australia?

49:40.040 --> 49:41.040
Sydney?

49:41.040 --> 49:42.040
Nope.

49:42.040 --> 49:44.680
That's the most common mistake.

49:44.680 --> 49:45.680
But like, see, I could...

49:45.680 --> 49:46.680
I know it's not Sydney.

49:46.680 --> 49:47.680
It's Canberra.

49:47.680 --> 49:50.920
But here's the thing is that, but you could do the same thing is that like, quick Australian

49:50.920 --> 49:51.920
listeners.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.680
What's the capital of Florida?

49:54.680 --> 49:56.960
How many of you said Miami?

49:56.960 --> 49:57.960
It's not.

49:57.960 --> 49:58.960
It's not.

49:58.960 --> 49:59.960
It's Tallahassee.

49:59.960 --> 50:00.960
Right.

50:00.960 --> 50:01.960
Just saying.

50:01.960 --> 50:04.800
Miami is the capital of where old folks go to die.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.800
And Miami is also the capital of cocaine.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.960
Come on.

50:08.960 --> 50:09.960
I'm kidding.

50:09.960 --> 50:10.960
Love Miami.

50:10.960 --> 50:11.960
Love you guys.

50:11.960 --> 50:13.560
When have you been to Miami?

50:13.560 --> 50:14.560
Wow, tonight.

50:14.560 --> 50:18.440
Actually, I went to their airport once on my way to Jamaica.

50:18.440 --> 50:24.000
I have been to Miami thousands of times thanks to the power of television.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.280
I've actually been to Miami once and I was two years old.

50:27.280 --> 50:31.160
Yeah, see, and SSG 100 Man has a perfect example.

50:31.160 --> 50:34.840
You ask people what the capital of California is, hello, we live there, and most people

50:34.840 --> 50:35.840
don't know.

50:35.840 --> 50:41.320
If you say Los Angeles, then you need to get your head out of your ass, because Los Angeles...

50:41.320 --> 50:42.320
Hey, wait a minute.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.840
You said Sydney was the capital of Australia.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.080
Get your head out of your ass.

50:45.080 --> 50:47.120
But I don't live there, so I have an excuse.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.200
Or get your ass out of your head, because it's Australia.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.200
Get it upside down.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.200
Get it.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.200
And the toilet splashed backwards.

50:52.200 --> 50:53.760
What the hell happened to tonight's show?

50:53.760 --> 50:56.160
It's just, it's just, it's just not right.

50:56.160 --> 50:57.680
I'm going to keep going then.

50:57.680 --> 50:58.680
Please do.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.680
Please.

50:59.680 --> 51:01.480
It's coming out here in May pretty soon.

51:01.480 --> 51:02.540
I'm pretty psyched about it.

51:02.540 --> 51:04.080
It's called Blastworks.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.280
Originally, it was Tamiki Fighters.

51:06.280 --> 51:11.720
Of course, now it's been, it's very little like Tamiki Fighters now.

51:11.720 --> 51:13.880
But still the same kind of concept.

51:13.880 --> 51:18.680
What's kind of neat about it, though, is you'll actually, of course, the game has like about

51:18.680 --> 51:22.200
20 different levels you can play and stuff, and plays a little bit like Katamari meets,

51:22.200 --> 51:25.280
you know, a really intense shooter game.

51:25.280 --> 51:31.800
But now you'll be able to design completely new ships, new levels, new enemies, new AI

51:31.800 --> 51:33.800
patterns, and new bullet patterns.

51:33.800 --> 51:39.560
So I mean, completely customizable, and you can share all this content over WeConnect24,

51:39.560 --> 51:40.560
which is pretty cool.

51:40.560 --> 51:44.960
So some of the levels, I guess, they were just showing off to like Joystick, for example.

51:44.960 --> 51:48.620
One of them looked like the environment was made out of paper, and you're actually flying

51:48.620 --> 51:53.500
a paper airplane and fighting other paper airplanes and origamies, enemies and stuff

51:53.500 --> 51:54.500
like that.

51:54.500 --> 51:56.200
So really cool stuff.

51:56.200 --> 52:02.160
Plus the game itself also has unlockable versions of Tamiki Fighters and some of the other games

52:02.160 --> 52:04.320
made by Kent Ducho.

52:04.320 --> 52:08.680
And if you're interested in checking out Tamiki Fighters, it's actually available for free

52:08.680 --> 52:10.440
on his website.

52:10.440 --> 52:14.180
Just do a search for Tamiki Fighters and definitely check it out.

52:14.180 --> 52:22.600
The game is slated to come out in the US in May, and I can't wait to check it out.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.480
Well this actually sounds kind of cool.

52:24.480 --> 52:27.400
It's kind of interesting that a game like this, it's kind of a, I wouldn't call this

52:27.400 --> 52:31.200
like a AAA title by any means, I mean it's based off an indie game, but kind of has all

52:31.200 --> 52:35.000
these features that we've been really waiting for on a lot of Wii games on it.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.680
Yeah, it looks really cool, and actually the four games that you can unlock in it are Rootage,

52:39.680 --> 52:43.640
Gunroar, Taurus Trooper, and of course the original Tamiki Fighters.

52:43.640 --> 52:47.400
So that's pretty cool, and I think this is going to be one of those games that a lot

52:47.400 --> 52:50.620
of people aren't going to know about, you know, it's one of those under-the-radar games.

52:50.620 --> 52:53.960
Is it going to be one of those under-the-radar costs, where it's only $20, or do we know

52:53.960 --> 52:57.020
a price point on this yet?

52:57.020 --> 53:00.320
If I remember correctly, I think it was like $39.99.

53:00.320 --> 53:05.040
So it's kind of your typical Wii, well, one step below your AAA Wii titles basically.

53:05.040 --> 53:08.100
But I mean, I think the value's pretty good, I mean if it was just going to be a straight

53:08.100 --> 53:14.000
port of Tamiki Fighters, it might be a little high, but with all the user-created stuff,

53:14.000 --> 53:18.040
I mean you can get pretty crazy with this game, so it'll be fun.

53:18.040 --> 53:22.160
Very good gaming story to bring us back from our capitals of the world discussion, I appreciate

53:22.160 --> 53:23.160
that.

53:23.160 --> 53:25.540
He's always working hard for O.L.R., isn't he?

53:25.540 --> 53:26.540
Very good.

53:26.540 --> 53:27.540
Yes.

53:27.540 --> 53:34.440
But yeah, definitely there's some video footage that looks like it's on GameTrailers.com,

53:34.440 --> 53:38.560
and they also have some links on Joystiq, you know, definitely check out the trailer

53:38.560 --> 53:39.560
if you can.

53:39.560 --> 53:43.800
If you've never played this game, do yourself a favor and play it, because it's really fun.

53:43.800 --> 53:46.000
At least Tamiki Fighters is.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Alright.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.940
Well, speaking of traveling the world and the capitals of the world, let's talk about

53:50.940 --> 53:55.480
what's coming out in Tokyo soon, because that is the capital of Japan.

53:55.480 --> 53:59.400
But actually, this will be the entirety of Japan, is getting these releases.

53:59.400 --> 54:06.080
This week in gaming, on March 19th, they are getting on the Xbox 360 Armored Core for Answer,

54:06.080 --> 54:14.240
Army of Two, Blazing Angels 2, Need for Speed Pro Street, Sengoku Mosu 2, and that's quite

54:14.240 --> 54:16.360
a few Xbox 360 games for one week.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.280
There you go.

54:18.280 --> 54:22.400
OddOne in chat says this is a favorite part of the show, Rob butchering the Japanese releases.

54:22.400 --> 54:25.040
That's why I read them, because I can't pronounce any of them.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.960
PlayStation 3, I can pronounce Armored Core.

54:27.960 --> 54:28.960
That's easy enough.

54:28.960 --> 54:33.320
PlayStation 3 also gets Armored Core, also gets Army of Two, also gets Blazing Angels

54:33.320 --> 54:39.360
2, but gets another game, Folk Soul, Unishanweta Densho.

54:39.360 --> 54:42.880
You might just know that as Folklore, but that's actually getting a price reduction

54:42.880 --> 54:45.500
that's already been out there, it's just a price reduction.

54:45.500 --> 54:51.620
Also getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3, Resistance, Ridge Racer 7, which I can't

54:51.620 --> 54:55.760
pronounce, and Mobile Suit Gundam, Target Insight, all getting price reductions this

54:55.760 --> 54:56.920
week.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.920
And cheaper games is never bad news.

54:59.920 --> 55:04.840
On the Nintendo Wii, speaking of price reductions, Bomberland Wii is moving in to the best, but

55:04.840 --> 55:09.400
some new games coming out, Spider-Man 3 just now coming out in Japan.

55:09.400 --> 55:12.680
I would suggest you just pass on that, but maybe you want to pick up the House of the

55:12.680 --> 55:18.040
Dead 2 and 3 with the Wii Zapper, also being sold independently there.

55:18.040 --> 55:21.720
Dekka Sporta also coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan.

55:21.720 --> 55:28.420
Moving on to the PlayStation 2, nothing really new coming out there, just some price reductions

55:28.420 --> 55:31.300
on The Godfather and Kamiwaza.

55:31.300 --> 55:34.280
Something to look forward to next week is the Metal Gear Solid collection, if you're

55:34.280 --> 55:35.280
looking out for that.

55:35.280 --> 55:40.000
Let's check out the handhelds, moving on to the Nintendo DS, Bangayo Spirits comes out

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
this week in Japan.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Yay!

55:42.000 --> 55:45.880
And Chonaketsu Koku Kunio-kun Dodge Ball comes out.

55:45.880 --> 55:46.880
Yay!

55:46.880 --> 55:49.280
This is going to be a fun week for Japan.

55:49.280 --> 55:58.040
Coming out from Konami, Kachushima Kosaku DS, Dikuru Otoko no Love and Success.

55:58.040 --> 56:05.000
SimCity DS 2 also comes out from EA on the Nintendo DS, and quickly glancing at the PSP

56:05.000 --> 56:08.820
to see if there's anything of note for you guys in Japan on there.

56:08.820 --> 56:13.640
Biohazard Trilogy Box, but that's the movies, sorry, not the games.

56:13.640 --> 56:16.740
But if you want that on your PSP, you can check that out.

56:16.740 --> 56:21.240
Also a port of Need for Speed Pro Street, and since Skype was recently released in Japan,

56:21.240 --> 56:24.880
I believe we covered that in last week's news, the PSP microphone is finally hitting the

56:24.880 --> 56:27.000
shelves this week in Japan.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
So check it out.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.960
I want Kunio-kun Dodge Ball.

56:29.960 --> 56:33.120
Well, you can import it from one of your favorite import retails.

56:33.120 --> 56:36.520
Or if you wait a few months, it'll be coming out over here.

56:36.520 --> 56:41.520
So I want my Kunio-kun Dodge Ball, which we would, of course, know over here as Super

56:41.520 --> 56:45.080
Dodge Ball, because it was sweet.

56:45.080 --> 56:47.240
Those Dodge Ball games are awesome.

56:47.240 --> 56:51.280
I love all the Kunio games, they're so nice.

56:51.280 --> 57:00.200
But anyway, for our friends overseas in the UK, I have some releases for you guys.

57:00.200 --> 57:07.440
On the 20th, CSI Crime Scene Investigation Hard Evidence on Wii, Mystery Dungeon Sheeran

57:07.440 --> 57:13.400
the Wanderer on DS, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, Sega Superstars Tennis on a bunch

57:13.400 --> 57:22.080
of stuff, Spin Out, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on Xbox 360 and PS3, Victorious

57:22.080 --> 57:26.920
Boxers Challenge, and then we've got some games on the 21st.

57:26.920 --> 57:29.360
That would be Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fate.

57:29.360 --> 57:38.480
We have Off-Road for PS2, PC, and PSP, Samurai Warriors 2, Extreme Legends, and that's it.

57:38.480 --> 57:42.280
Very surprised no one mentioned Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fate in their

57:42.280 --> 57:43.280
gaming weeks.

57:43.280 --> 57:46.720
Because I heard the game came out, some of my friends picked it up, and have been raving

57:46.720 --> 57:47.720
about it.

57:47.720 --> 57:48.720
I didn't like Crystal Chronicles.

57:48.720 --> 57:53.880
I didn't either, but the DS version doesn't look quite like the GameCube one, so it might

57:53.880 --> 57:55.760
be worth a look, I don't know.

57:55.760 --> 57:56.760
I'm just curious.

57:56.760 --> 57:57.760
How about Chatters?

57:57.760 --> 57:59.440
Are Chatters picking it up?

57:59.440 --> 58:02.880
Post your reviews real quickly, I'll read some of them in a minute.

58:02.880 --> 58:06.720
In the US, we're getting a few things that are pretty interesting.

58:06.720 --> 58:13.200
This week, of course, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

58:13.200 --> 58:18.160
Sega Superstars Tennis coming out on almost everything, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3,

58:18.160 --> 58:20.720
Xbox 360, Wii, and the DS.

58:20.720 --> 58:25.960
The Metal Gear Solid Essentials Collection is coming out on PlayStation 2, if you want

58:25.960 --> 58:31.600
to relive some of those older Metal Gear games before number 4 comes out.

58:31.600 --> 58:37.080
Condemned 2 Bloodshot on PlayStation 3, apparently a week late.

58:37.080 --> 58:40.880
Hot Shots Golf Out of Bounds on PlayStation 3.

58:40.880 --> 58:44.120
Lost in Blue 3 on the DS.

58:44.120 --> 58:47.960
I'm still shocked that they actually got a third game in that series.

58:47.960 --> 58:53.040
I wouldn't be surprised if we see a fourth one either, or horn that thing to death.

58:53.040 --> 58:57.800
Kingstar 90's Edition is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.

58:57.800 --> 59:05.580
Samurai Warriors 2 Extreme Legends on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 via download.

59:05.580 --> 59:14.980
Some other fun stuff, Worms of Space Oddity on the Wii, Fantasy Aquarium on the DS, Go

59:14.980 --> 59:21.440
Pets Vacation Island on the DS, which looks really weird and kind of stupid looking, Pro

59:21.440 --> 59:27.080
Evolution Soccer 2008 on the Wii, that one also is a week late, George of the Jungle

59:27.080 --> 59:38.480
on PlayStation 2, Wii, and the DS, and let's see here, the PlayStation 3 version of Karaoke

59:38.480 --> 59:40.940
Revolution American Idol is finally coming out.

59:40.940 --> 59:52.120
That totally delayed for about a month now, and let's see, I believe that's it.

59:52.120 --> 59:57.480
Next week though, the week after next, I should say, and I can't wait for this, Crisis Core,

59:57.480 --> 01:00:02.360
Final Fantasy VII for the PSP.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:09.960
All right, well, moving on, talking about something recently hitting the US, DDR, you

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960
remember DDR?

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:22.240
Our whole show used to be about DDR, and DDR is still going, obviously we get phone calls

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.000
from folks on Skype once in a while, why don't you love Bomani like you used to, then we

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.320
have to say, because it hasn't changed, well anyhow, actually, DDR is changing a little

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320
bit.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.000
E-Amusement, you've heard of this before, E-Amusement is a system they have in Japan

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.240
where you basically have these little cars, picture, y'all know, if you've been in the

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.320
arcade, y'all know Initial D, right, how you have the cards, picture something like

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.760
that but on a DDR machine, where you can kind of save your high scores, but it's also hooked

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.920
into the internet, and so you can have these global leaderboards and all this stuff.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:55.240
Well, guess what, the E-Amusement system finally, after all these years, is hitting America.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.240
That was damn time.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.920
And this is coming from an official Konami website, DDROnlineCommunity.com is their website,

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.080
and it's got the Konami logos and all that fun stuff, is they are announcing that Naperville,

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:11.360
Illinois of all places, because when I think of arcade gaming, I think of Naperville, Illinois,

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.000
but this must be one hella good arcade, Brunswick Zone is the arcade, is going to be getting

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.120
the E-Amusement system, and come to think of it, this is an arcade that usually does

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.080
a lot of the beta tests for DDR, so I'm not surprised, it's just kind of funny that, you

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.440
know, ground zero for DDR evolution.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.440
I'm not sure, because I don't know too much about Bedson, but maybe it's close to one

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.720
of Bedson's distribution centers, something like that, maybe, I don't know, I'm just guessing.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.480
Brunswick makes me think of bowling.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.520
I know, I think Brunswick did make bowling stuff.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520
They make bowling pins.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.560
They might do entertainment stuff, you know, in other places.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.560
But anyhow, and as Konami says on the site, it's the new online service which connects

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.360
arcade locations in North America via the internet.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.440
Arcade players can compete with each other, review their ranking, tournament results,

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.120
save the play data, and more.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:59.180
Konami will expand this new level service nationwide with Brunswick Bowling and Billiards.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:02.760
So coming to a bowling alley near you, there you have it.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:08.200
Now my question is, is this enough to make you interested in DDR again?

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.200
Maybe.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200
I say not really.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.360
I kind of miss the old internet ranking that we had back in the day.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.600
Oh yeah, that was old school.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:22.040
But yeah, I mean, besides the fact that I do miss DDR a little bit for the nostalgia

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.040
value, here's the reason why I don't think this is exactly the kick in the butt in the

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:30.680
community that DDR's kind of needed for about, oh, four years now, is that the internet's

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:35.120
already been doing this long before Konami decided to officially endorse it.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.120
Right?

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.200
This has been going on since, like, Fourth Mix.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.200
That's, you know, those sites, like, what are those tracking sites for DDR?

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.760
I mean, they've come and gone.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.040
That's how long those things have been around.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.080
Well, it didn't a long time ago, and it was built in the Fourth Mix.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.000
They had a code that you could write down that you could go onto the website and plug

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.560
it in, and there's your internet rankings.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.880
And I understand this is a little more fluid than that system, but, you know, I'm just

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.360
thinking of those websites where, you know, you could type in your scores, like, they

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.000
have them for all types of music games.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.880
You type in your scores, what letter grade you got on it, and, you know, you can get

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.020
a little signature banner, and it's basically like, you know, here's how big your E-penis

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:14.240
is because I passed all these DDR songs.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.080
And then somebody could challenge you if they thought you were lying about your score, blah

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.080
blah blah blah blah.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.080
I think it's cool.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.080
Um, what's...

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.720
GS68 says VJ Army.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.440
Yeah, like that, but DDR.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.240
There was one for DDR they had.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.240
Here's what they need to do.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.400
And this would be pretty cool, uh, is, I don't know, you could have, like, certain, you know,

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.960
teams or whatever that you, I guess, associate yourself with.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.520
I don't know how many, like, different colors or whatever.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.480
And then you could say, like, you play different arcades around, you know, the country or the

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.400
world or whatever, and you kind of capture them, and they become, like, you know, blue

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.800
or whatever, or red or whatever your color is.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.020
And then, kind of like, remember how they had with Soul Calibur?

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.020
I think it was Soul Calibur.

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.020
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.020
That was fun.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.020
Yeah.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.020
That's what I'm talking about.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.020
Making DDR a more competitive game, right?

01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.020
Yeah.

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:04.040
That's what I've been saying for five years on this program that DDRs needed to do.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.280
There is innovation sitting in there in the game.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.960
Just make DDR more competitive as opposed to cooperative game.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:13.720
You could make a whole new game out of it and really kick some butt in the franchise,

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:14.720
but nobody's listening.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.400
What they need to do, and I'm not sure who's in charge of the DDR games, is they need to

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.600
get someone new in charge of the DDR games.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:28.840
DDR Recall, says Akdeft, was the name of what I was trying to think of earlier, thank you.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.840
There it is.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.320
Anyhow, so those of you that are still playing DDR, and I know we have a lot of DDR fans

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:38.600
at least, I'm not trying to knock DDR, I mean, obviously, it's still a great game because

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600
it keeps you physical and everything.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.240
Hey, if I had the money and the room, I'd be buying a machine for my house, okay, so

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.240
whatever.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.240
I'd still be playing that.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.700
It just frustrates me that they won't innovate the damn game.

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.320
I just don't have time to make it down to arcades anymore, so.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:57.520
I'll say it one more time, if anybody happens to be listening, and I know we have folks

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:03.000
on the inside that listen to this show once in a great while, nuke your code, build something

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.720
from the ground up, innovate in the process, watch money flow in.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:12.080
And stop, for the love of God, I know that you like doing these other modes like the

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.660
fitness mode and that kind of shit, you don't need to go that crazy with this stuff, I mean,

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:22.080
I think they've made it too user friendly, too simple, you know what I mean?

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.520
I don't think you need a training mode in every single DDR game, because I know I didn't

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:32.800
need a training mode to play the damn game, I learned just fine by playing the damn game.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.160
Let's move on.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.160
Can we?

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.160
Yes.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:44.760
Well, there is more news out there that will make iPhone owners happy, including myself.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:51.520
There are going to be some game releases, including Pac-Man and Galaga, and that makes

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.720
me very happy.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.720
Also...

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.920
Sorry, go ahead.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:02.160
Also bejeweled, so I guess it's, I mean, Zuma and Pagle, which I don't really give a crap

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.240
about, I just care about Pac-Man and Galaga.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.960
Pagle is really awesome, actually.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960
Is it?

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960
Yes.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.960
Oh thank God, I can play Pac-Man!

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.200
I wonder if you play with your finger.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.640
Can't you play pretty much all these games on the iPod anyway?

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.200
Including Pagle?

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.840
Which is actually one of the better, I think the iPod was made for Pagle, it's awesome.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:28.240
From what I hear it sucks, like Bejeweled you have to cycle through all the gems and

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:33.560
stuff using the little, whatever the fuck they call that thing, scroll wheel, touch

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.200
wheel, gay wheel, whatever.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.520
The whole screen is touch screen.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.120
It's just, I don't know.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:44.040
I think you should just be able to poke whichever one and then poke the one next to it.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.320
I think Bejeweled would be good on it.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.120
I think that would work pretty well.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.400
I'm surprised they haven't put Bejeweled on the DS yet.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.440
I mean, they really, fuck, put a PopCap collection on the DS.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.680
Watch how much that sells.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.800
You know what else would work out?

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.440
You know what other games would work really well on the iPhone?

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.040
New things.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.440
New games.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.840
Things that haven't been thought of yet.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.560
New stuff.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.320
We have this game that we would like to pitch.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.920
It's called Pen and Paper.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.240
You can use the iPhone as paper and you can write stuff with your stylus, which is the

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.240
pen.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.960
Yes, and here's one.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.880
It's based off a popular Saturday Night Live sketch and you have cats and they have lasers

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.320
attached to their heads and where you touch on the screen you shoot lasers at dogs and

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:34.120
people and sometimes other laser cats in multiplayer mode.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.320
I just had a random thought pop into my head.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.320
What's that?

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.880
I had a different video game experience this week but that was watching the Family Guy

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.280
Star Wars special.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.840
Did it feel like a game or something?

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:50.080
No, they were going into an asteroid field and it was asteroids.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.680
Nice.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.200
Anyway.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:08:02.400
So, apparently the Chinese Olympics website has been accused of game piracy.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.920
Apparently they have been stealing some Flash games that they feature on the website and

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:13.040
kind of changing them just a little bit but they're still blatantly stealing them.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:20.120
According to the creator of these Flash games, Caden Batrick, who noticed some very similar

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:26.440
similarities with different games like Fua Fights, The Olympic Clouds, which is very

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.680
similar to his Snow Day game that he has.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.160
Also there are some other ones that were also very similar.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:41.760
Of course, these have been removed from the Olympic sites as of last Monday but there

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.960
are still a couple of games that are on there that may be stolen from some other websites

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.120
as well.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.960
As if we didn't need more reasons to say the Olympics suck.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.720
Odd One has an interesting comment in chat that says, wait, aren't most Flash games rip

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.400
offs of each other or classic games, seriously, the Flash arena is rife with IP theft and

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.400
copying.

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.400
True, they are, but this I think was like blatant.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.400
I mean, just like, if you made like a Super Mario Brothers game but instead you changed

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:20.420
it to, I don't know, a female chicken or something like that, that would be a blatant ripoff

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:23.680
of Mario Brothers.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.160
And I don't know, you called it like Chick Sisters or something like that.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.280
Wasn't that the PETA game?

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.600
Oh yes, that was!

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.400
That's right, yeah, blatant ripoff.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.200
Not really, though, because the level design was totally different, but yeah, I get what

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.200
you're saying.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200
Yeah, it was crap.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.200
Made me hungry for chicken, though.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.200
Alright.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.840
And really, who goes to the Chinese Olympics website to play Flash games?

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.320
I mean, are people that bored?

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.920
I don't think so.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.200
Good question.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:58.960
Well, we're just about done with part A tonight, but first off we have to read about our stupid

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.240
person of the week.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.720
And actually, I don't know, this isn't so much stupid, it's just kind of sad.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.360
I don't really know how else to say it, so let's cue some music to read this very sad

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:13.440
story.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:23.600
A 15-year-old boy in the Austin area of Austin, Texas, got killed, gunshot wound to the head.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.720
The boy was playing a video game and his friend just shot him in the head, 13-year-old shooter

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:35.360
shoots his 15-year-old friend in the head over a video game, I suppose is what the story

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:39.600
is trying to say, because they do make a mention at the very end of this story.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.240
The boys were playing a video game, the game was called God of War.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:50.760
Oh yes, because there's tons of gun violence in God of War.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:56.920
Thank you so much to these kids for giving Gamers Everywhere a wonderful name.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.920
How are the parents?

01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.920
Where?

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.640
Out buying more ammo, of course.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.480
Okay, I don't see how, there's no way they're going to be able to tie that to the game,

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.480
because there's no fucking guns in God of War.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.480
At all.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.480
Zero.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.000
It just sucks.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.800
I mean, it's not funny, it's sad, it's just kids shooting each other, but you've got to

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.640
wonder, where did the kid learn to shoot someone else, where did the kid learn to load a gun?

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.640
Maybe it was already loaded.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.640
It's not that hard to load a gun.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.640
Well, it's just sad.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.640
It's not that hard to pull a trigger, either.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:38.320
All right, well let's try to make the show a little better, and for that we're going

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.960
to turn to Dark Sakura to help us out a little bit.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.000
Dark Sakura, do you think you can help make our show a little better tonight?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I could.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.300
All right, well she's going to do that by sharing with us her pick for a classic video

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.320
game to pay some respect to.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:58.120
It's called Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.600
And what game did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:08.440
The game I picked was actually a series of games called The Last Blade, which was a Neo

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.400
Geo game put out by SNK.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:19.760
I actually have the Dreamcast Last Blade 2 myself, and it's such a really, really good

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.800
2D fighter, I mean really, really good.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:31.240
It's set around in...

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.240
I would have to...

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:39.320
I'm not really exactly when the exact time frame is in Japan, because there's references

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:46.620
to the Shinsengumi, to fighting for the Shogun, so I would assume it's right.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.800
And from what I can tell from the characters in the game, it's sort of right around that

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.800
transitional period.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:56.500
But it's really just, you've got people who use different weapons.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:04.800
One of the guys who worked on Guilty Gear actually helped develop this game, too.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.440
And it's really, really good.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:14.000
You've also got your choice of using power or speed, so you can have a stronger, slower

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.360
character, you can have someone who's weaker, but faster.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:22.200
And of course, you've got your attacks and combos that incorporate all of that.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:28.400
I just really think that it's a very nice game, and one of the other things that it

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:37.520
brought into it was a deflect, where you could block a move, and then you would be able to

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.800
instantly attack.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.560
So I thought that was a pretty neat function, as well.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:51.520
Also, Last Blade was the first SNK game to bring in Super Campus into its gameplay.

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:57.840
And you've got desperation moves, super moves, all kinds of stuff, it's just really, really

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840
a fun game.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.080
The series is fun.

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:06.440
And the thing I like about it, too, is that the music is pretty, I guess, almost on the

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.400
classical end, and one of the things that I really liked about it, and this is going

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:15.800
to sound kind of cheeseball, is that when you go into each stage, you sort of have a

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:21.600
little cutscene in the top corner that sets up the area you're playing in.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.440
And I think it's really cool, not just for the story, the characters themselves, but

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.520
the environments in the game.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.640
And the explosive blood!

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.680
I love the little fatality-type things they do there, I just saw one in the little, like...

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.640
Look, this is the perfect successor to the Samurai Shodown series.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640
Very nice.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.080
It's just a lot of fun.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.680
Lots of approval from the chat room on your pick tonight, DarkSakura.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:51.160
I believe Footy in chat said it was his favorite 2D fighter ever.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160
Yeah.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.160
Ever.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160
Oh, sorry.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.640
I was going to say, there was, I'm trying to remember the character that I played the

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:04.840
most, because I played the one who dressed up as her brother.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.600
And I don't remember the character.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.600
You played a cross-dresser?

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.040
Yes, I did.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:16.160
I was going to say, there was another game that's out there, that sold 1 point, or, uh...

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.560
It was Kojiro, sorry.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:24.240
Point one eight million now for, uh, Eye of Judgment.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.740
Never gonna happen.

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.240
Never gonna happen.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:34.240
All right, well, there you have it, tonight's classic game of the week, The Last Blade.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.920
Just the whole damn series.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920
On every platform.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920
Neo Geo, Dreamcast.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920
There's one on Dreamcast, right?

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920
There's Dreamcast.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.560
I believe that there were PS2 versions.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.800
I do want to say that there were, but of course, the Dreamcast one was, like, beautiful.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.760
All right, so we'll say the Dreamcast version, then, because you're such a Dreamcast fan.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.040
I love Dreamcast.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.040
Really everything.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.800
All right, so check that out, The Last Blade.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:01.320
Uh, that's going to bring our part A to a close tonight, so we're going to take a break,

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:06.480
and we'll be back, though, never fear, with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:10.880
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.880
a week.

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:24.840
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
