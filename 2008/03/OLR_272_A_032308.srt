There's a host, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loco

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, March 23, 2008, Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live gets a new expansion,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Gibson sues even more businesses over Guitar Hero,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and could Kid Icarus be really making a comeback this year?

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yo.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How are you, Miss Summers?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm full of waffles.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Enjoying the Easter waffles. Isn't this a tradition in your fam?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, with our big group of people.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Although it seems that every year there's a new baby added with our friends who join us.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Because one year they have Bob, the next year they have Tatiana is her name.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They call her Tater.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's a nice name for a child, Tater.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
She's cute. She's a cutie.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't doubt it. Babies are cute.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And, um, um, we basically just, you know, went to Marie Callender's and got, well, everyone goes, I finally learned my lesson after doing this for eight years.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is, um, they always go through the omelet line, and I get sick on the omelets every year for some reason.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So I was like, screw your omelets! I'm having eggs Benedict and waffles.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I had waffles and chocolate eclairs.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Here we go with the whole Food Network thing again.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I swear, our podcast. Video Games Plus Food Equals Yum.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That was great.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That was the alternate name for our podcast, by the way.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No, I'm making that up.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright, well, Happy Easter to you, Dark Soccer. I'm glad to hear it.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And the blessed Ostara to you.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Waffly good for you.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And Happy Easter, whatever the heck it is you guys all celebrate.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, technically the Spring Equinox is Friday.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If anything. Huh?

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Spring Equinox is Friday.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Alright, then Happy Equinox. Happy whatever.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Happy day. Just happy day.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Happy day, Loki. Tech Master Loki, also here every week.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hello.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How are you?

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm okay.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Did you do anything special today? Did the Easter Bunny leave you anything good?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, I just went over to my mom's house and we barbecued ribs.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mmm ribs!

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You guys have interesting ways of spending Easter.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I mean, interesting good. Not like interesting bad.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But more food.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Or as Frisbee in Chat Room says,

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
chat.orangelandtrader.com, the always present fourth guest on the show.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Waffle Lounge Foodio.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That could be the name of the show. Waffle Lounge Foodio.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You could play the waffle song from Mystery Science Theater.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No, we're not going to play the waffle song right now.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We're going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week, but first a teaser.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A little teaser.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We have big news to talk about. Like, big.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Like, we just found out 30 minutes ago big.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We'll be talking about that in just a moment.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I know a lot of people in chat are kind of going like WTF because they can hear us on Justin TV talking and like want to know what's up.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And yes, someone died. I killed them.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, no one died.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The ferret died. Where has he been for the past like year?

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Actually, I found the ferret the other day and then I put him back in the dusty corner and I found him and...

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hey, you should have brought the ferret out.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It was uneventful.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Really.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's it?

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It was uneventful.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No DSing? No Ragnarok? No nothing?

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, I played Ragnarok.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, of course. Of course. I mean, that goes without saying.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But I actually did not touch my DS all week. I moved that game.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That game that Dan brought me home that I'm not going to play.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The Professor whatever the fuck it is.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Professor Layton?

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You know, I've heard a lot of good things about that game. You might actually want to check it out at some point.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's hearing. I'm not going to play it.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, then give it to me. I'll play it.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, you can borrow it.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She doesn't like learning games. She's above that.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, you don't like learning.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, I've already learned.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And I found your copy of Every Extend Extra.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sweet.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, that's where it went.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
At my house. It got lost in the vault.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Things disappear at Dark Sakura's house.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's okay. I found some of Kristen's movies, too.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Alright.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Alright, well, then since your gaming week was uneventful, I'll turn to Loki. How was your gaming week?

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I wish I could say I was much better.

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I did play a game.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I played Saints Row multiplayer and also the single player stuff because that's why I was playing during lunch.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, really this week, though, I was still trying to fix that one 360. I have it now not three-ringed anymore.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, I just have to see if it stays that way because I don't know if I mentioned this, but I had a third 360 go down on me now.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So, now it's three there, three ringed, and three there not.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So, what percentage of Xbox 360s does that make?

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
50.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
50% of them.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
50%.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Luckily, this new one, though, what I did for this one, or I'm planning on doing, is right now it's in one of the clear cases.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So, I'm going to put the old case back on it, and then I bought off of eBay a security label from Microsoft,

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you know, one of the ones that they removed on there.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So, I'm going to slap that back on there, and they can fucking replace the thing because I'm not touching it, bastards.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, and I'm addressing this comment in chat because some people may not know.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mike W. says, how many 360s does Loki have again?

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, please refresh us.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How many 360s do you have?

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have six.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And why that many?

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I had to land them in a game room, and I got them for that.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's amazing.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's amazing.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, I had five originally, but then I bought one to replace another one, but I ended up fixing the original.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, we have six.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wow.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
One that hopefully will be fixed here pretty soon because, like I said, it's not three ringed anymore,

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
but I think it may have overheated so many times that it's damaged, but we'll see.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then this last one, which I'm sending to Microsoft, so that will be fixed.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So, hopefully it will all be fixed at one point.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But it's not very promising that three out of the six have died within the last, like, three months.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Nice.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So, that's all I really got around to playing this week.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I do have a lot of stuff lined up for this week, including K Project, which is that Res Beta that got released out there.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, I want to try that because that looks cool.

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've got to dig out my Dreamcast for that.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And then Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, actually I played a little bit of Smash Brothers this week.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Just space emissary stuff.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, and I added everybody in the goddamn friends code list, so stop your bitching.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, seriously.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Nobody was online when I was online earlier, so you know what?

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Stop complaining.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Talking about the Orange Lounge Radio forum thread, right?

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Of course.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's what I thought.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, I added everyone.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No, I didn't add everyone, but I added most people, like...

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No, I think I might have added everyone.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So, because I have, like, 40 codes in there, and I've hardly ever played Smash Brothers.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But I'm guessing since Loki's done, I'll go over to my game a week.

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have been playing Smash Brothers a little bit.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've been working mostly on, like, the single player stuff, not emissary mode for some reason.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because my friend played, like, 70% through emissary mode, so I didn't even really have to.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean, I guess I should go back to his file and beat it or something so I can get some of those characters.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I've been working mostly on single player and trying to unlock everything in the gallery.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Like, you know, play five brawls with Princess Peach to get Super Mario 2 and, like, things like that.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I've been trying to do as much of that stuff as I can.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So, good times.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And otherwise, I haven't been playing a whole lot.

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I went back to the Xbox 360 and just played some random old stuff.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Nothing really of note was playing some World of Warcraft, but I was out of town this weekend.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I was staying about a block from the Metreon.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Didn't even think to go there.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just didn't, it's not what it used to be.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You know, if you were there next week, you could actually go to a Crysis core launch party.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's alright.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, actually, I do have to go back to San Francisco next week anyway.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So, maybe I'll check it out.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, it's like Tuesday.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, never mind. I'm not going on a weekday.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hmm, interesting.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Alright.

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So, yeah, no new games to review this week.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's kind of odd.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I've been playing Scrabulous on Facebook.

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's just like Scrabble.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I rented a movie on the Xbox Live movie service thing.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, what'd you rent?

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I rented Dark City.

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And how was that?

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's a cool movie.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I've seen it before, so it was cool.

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Was it in HD?

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, they didn't have an HD version of that, but it's just standard definition.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It wasn't that expensive.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
240 points.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And, fuck, it's pretty easy.

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You don't have to wait that long.

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You just kind of download it and about, I'd say, 30 seconds later, you could start watching it.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, it just depends on your bandwidth.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you have dial-up, you might have a problem.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, if you have dial-up, I don't think you're going to fucking be downloading a movie.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That would suck.

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
One gigabyte file?

192
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, no thanks.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't know. It was okay.

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I just want to hear something funny, too.

195
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Actually, I have a friend at work right now who's really into rock band,

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and he keeps playing all the hard songs for me and then locking me achievements.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Nice.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Because, you know, I can't fucking play the game on hard.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What am I talking about?

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I can play guitar. I can't do drums.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, I played rock band this week.

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I played a lot of rock band this week, actually.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's why you take it to parties.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Because of that new, and I don't want to spoil the story of this coming up,

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
but some of you guys know, rock band had some enhancements this week,

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and we'll talk about them a little more a little later on,

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
but I went to check them out.

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I haven't checked the rock band store in a long time,

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and I forgot that you can get some Nine Inch Nails songs that are pretty cool,

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and I got that.

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And then the B-52s have a song on there, so I had to get that,

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
so I went shopping on rock band because I heart microtransactions.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I've spent way too much money.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Not really, but yeah, I've spent way too much money.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, way too much on rock band, seriously.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But just think, the next party we have is going to be so bitchin' with rock band.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So we need a rock band party.

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The thing though, they don't make it very easy because of that stupid digital rights management.

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know, anything I download, and if I bring it over here,

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
whatever, I have to be logged in on live in order for all that content to be available.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It sucks.

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah, it really blows.

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
ActDeft is crying in chat.

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He says, Mexico still can't access the music store in rock band.

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You know what, in some ways it's a good thing,

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
because then you just start spending money so stupidly,

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
because you're like, oh, I have points.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I could just spend them.

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's a sad face.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah.

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What?

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That is a sad face.

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That is a sad face.

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Very sad face.

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So, there you have it.

236
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, so let's get to the big news, and it actually really sucks.

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Like, there's really no easy way for us to kind of mention this.

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Literally we just heard about some of the changes that have been going on with our streaming provider,

239
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
which is Live 365, literally about 30 minutes before our show went live tonight,

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and the long and the short of it is that Live 365 is making some obscene changes in their pricing policies,

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and they are going to be upping their rates to these obscene amounts.

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Basically right now we pay about $60 a month to have about 100 live listeners.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We would have to pay under this new plan $120 a month for 60 live listeners,

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
which would only barely accommodate what we do on Sundays.

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Usually we don't talk about ratings.

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We get about 50 to 60 live people on a good Sunday night,

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and we've actually gone beyond that before.

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think our highest show had 70 or 80.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think we've hit higher than 80.

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I want to say we have, but I don't know.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It just sucks because it kind of came out of nowhere.

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Supposedly, Live 365 sent an email a month ago.

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know. I never got it, so whatever.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They're upping these rates, and even if we could afford it, we kind of don't want to.

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We've made a decision that we will be leaving Live 365 effective on April 12th.

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So that really sucks because that means the feed that we started in May of 2002 is going away.

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I wish this was an April Fool's joke chat.

258
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's not. It's completely legitimate.

259
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is not an April Fool's joke, like a preemptive strike or something,

260
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
because it's not even April yet.

261
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But we have no choice but to leave Live 365.

262
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You'll note I said we are not quitting the show,

263
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
so the question is now how do we continue to do Orange Lounge Radio,

264
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but not with Live 365, who we've kind of had for about five and a half years and so on.

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And trust me, a lot of the obvious things you guys are talking about in chat,

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
we're thinking about them too.

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So we've sent some emails.

268
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We've kind of put our feelers out there and done some discussion

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to see what we can do over the next week,

270
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and we'll hopefully have further information to announce for you guys next week.

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And whether that's our own shoutcast, I haven't the foggiest idea.

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Again, guys, you have to understand literally we found out about this like 30 minutes to an hour ago,

273
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
so we're still trying to kind of scramble to.

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But regardless, our live feed will be closing effective April 12th,

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
meaning that those of you guys that listen at work to the lovely video game music

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that plays all day long and the retro lunch and all that, it's going away.

277
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And what I feel most horrible for are the other live folks that we've had

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
bless our stream with their presence for their hard work in live shows over the years,

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
including DMN, including Travis Donovan, of course,

280
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
including extra for back when he had his show,

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
including the three of us that do our spinoff shows and we feel like it,

282
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and the things that we had planned that we wanted to do with the live feed

283
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
that now all those plans are effectively off, unfortunately.

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And obviously we'll do whatever we can for our friends that broadcast as well,

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
but we have to kind of like our number one priority right now is relocating our Sunday show first,

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and then we'll see what we can do after that.

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Act Def asked, what's going to happen to DM Insanity and TDL?

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I hope they keep going.

289
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I hope they keep going somehow, but unfortunately,

290
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio won't be around for them to do that with.

291
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So Orange Lounge Radio kind of ends in a way on April 12th

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
because Orange Lounge Radio was the radio station.

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This show is actually Orange Lounge Radio Live,

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but obviously over the years it's just been like Orange Lounge Radio.

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So yeah, I don't know.

296
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The next week is going to be very interesting.

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So that's the news.

298
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If you have suggestions or offers, I guess, I don't know,

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
send us an email.

300
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You can contact me in my personal email box,

301
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
rob at orangeloungeradio.com or our general email bag,

302
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
mailbagorangeloungeradio.com.

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We think we know what we want to do.

304
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We think we know the option that makes the most sense to us,

305
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
but it involves other people.

306
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We have to make sure they want to do it too.

307
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So that's that.

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You got anything else you guys want to add?

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't know.

310
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I've kind of been dying.

311
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't know.

312
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you don't like what's going on, you send your emails,

313
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'd say, to the Live 365.

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Professionally, please.

315
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah, professionally.

316
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And then in turn, they hopefully will send emails

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
to whomever is charging them.

318
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Unfortunately, I think that they probably

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
know what's going to happen because they're raising

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
all the rates on their stations.

321
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Obviously, a lot of people are just

322
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
going to forego paying those rates and just quit

323
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
or find elsewhere, and that's unfortunate.

324
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I imagine we're not the only station that's doing this.

325
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And I'm sure that they didn't have, you know,

326
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
it wasn't really their choice to do that,

327
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
but that's kind of they have to build.

328
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It does go back to the royalty things you've probably

329
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
heard about from the past year.

330
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
At least that's what they're blaming it on,

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
but I still think it was kind of a bit out of left field.

332
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It gives them taking advantage of that situation

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
for their own personal gain.

334
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I can't help but feel there's a little of that going on.

335
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Anything you want to add, Jamie?

336
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
As to somebody who's been a live broadcaster for this long?

337
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Not really.

338
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Not that it hasn't already been said.

339
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So, it sucks.

340
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Wah, wah.

341
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Only to get a fuse.

342
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No.

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Ross Steele, UT, says Life 365 is simply

344
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
using the RIAA boogeyman as an excuse to screw people.

345
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't want to knock them right now,

346
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
but let me put it this way.

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We have the money to keep going if we wanted to.

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We could do the 60 listener limit,

349
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but we just kind of don't want to.

350
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We think we can do better.

351
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This is more of an incentive.

352
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It kind of shows us that like, hey, Orange Launch Radio,

353
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
you guys have been kind of lazy the past six years.

354
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Just stay on the Life 365, because it was convenient

355
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and it was there, and you just touch a button

356
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and everything's all set up.

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So, this is really going to kind of force

358
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
us to explore alternatives.

359
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And it could be exciting.

360
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It could be the beginning of big change.

361
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Big change.

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
When one door closes, another opens.

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Absolutely right.

364
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I was just going to check that out.

365
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is also another option right here.

366
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They have actually people that do hosting for unlimited listeners.

367
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We'll see.

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Maybe.

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We'll see.

370
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Maybe.

371
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Maybe.

372
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't know.

373
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So, we'll see over the next week.

374
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We're exploring lots and lots of ideas.

375
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So that's that.

376
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Obviously, our number one priority is keeping this show going.

377
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't think that many people's worlds will be crushed without a 24-7 music feed.

378
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I apologize to those that have been listening to our 24-7 music feed.

379
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I know there are some that do,

380
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but obviously Sunday show is the priority for us right now.

381
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So, we'll see.

382
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
All right.

383
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Too much bad news tonight.

384
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Too much bad news.

385
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
We need to get into some other news.

386
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The show will continue.

387
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Even if we have to do a non-live show for a couple of weeks, we will.

388
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
While we relocate, we'll do whatever it takes,

389
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
but we don't plan on shutting down this show,

390
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the Sunday night program as it is.

391
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So, that's that.

392
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So, we're still here.

393
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Na-na-na-na-na.

394
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You can't shut us down that easily.

395
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
All right.

396
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's get into other housekeeping tonight.

397
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The other housekeeping tonight, of course,

398
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
a happy Easter or whatever it is you celebrate today.

399
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If nothing at all, then happy Sunday to you.

400
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
To all of our Orange Launch Radio listeners,

401
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
yes, we are here live on Easter

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
because everybody, I guess, did their stuff this morning.

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I went to the Bay Area this weekend,

404
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
had a very lovely weekend in San Francisco.

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It was good.

406
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Speaking of San Francisco, this is more of a personal favor.

407
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I promised some friends of mine.

408
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's another hobby of mine that I do,

409
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and I promised them I would plug this on the show.

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's kind of a live appearance for me, so to speak,

411
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and it would only work if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area,

412
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
so I apologize to our listeners who are not.

413
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But on Friday, April 25th,

414
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
in the city of San Francisco at the Clay Theater,

415
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
which is at Clay and Fillmore in San Francisco,

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm going to be appearing in a live showing of Shock Treatment,

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
which is a movie that is the sequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, sort of.

418
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I mean, it's not really the sequel, but...

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It has the same characters?

420
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Kind of. It has Brad and Janet.

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
If you see it, watch it again so that you'll get it.

422
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, exactly.

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And the thing is that they do Rocky Horror Picture Show,

424
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and I've been involved with that for a long time.

425
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You know, the show I did before Orange Lawns Radio actually started

426
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
because of Travis and I's mutual love of Rocky Horror Picture Show

427
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
under Station Live.

428
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I still am involved with that, not as heavily as I used to be,

429
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
but I still respect the scene and the counterculture that it provides.

430
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This is very rare to have this show on the big screen.

431
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This is probably the only time this year, outside of a convention,

432
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
this will show on the big screen, anywhere.

433
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So it's Friday, April 25th.

434
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm going to be in it. I'm in the cast.

435
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's a huge cast. There's like 15 to 20 other people.

436
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So check that out. It's at the Clay Theater, April 25th.

437
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And a guy that was actually in the movie is going to be there, too,

438
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Gary Shale.

439
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He was an Oscar drill of Oscar drilling the bits.

440
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He's going to be there, and he's performing live at the show.

441
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Is he going to play the same character?

442
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That'd be funny.

443
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
About 20 years later, I think so.

444
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't think he's going to be in the movie,

445
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
but he's going to do a live performance of probably that song,

446
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and I think he's done a musical career since then,

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
so maybe like one or two of his other songs.

448
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I want to go.

449
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's pretty cool.

450
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You should go. It'll be fun.

451
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll have to arrange work earlier that day.

452
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
All right. So it'll be fun. Friday, April 25th.

453
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Completely different than video games,

454
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
but I promised the cast I would give them a shout-out.

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Shout-out!

456
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The Orange Lounge Radio Wiki.

457
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Jamie, I showed you that before the show.

458
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Isn't that awesome, the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki?

459
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I love it that you're missing some jokes.

460
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You need to go old school.

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We have like, you know, cake, death cake.

462
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There's lots of old school jokes,

463
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
but I've got to say I'm very impressed with the work

464
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
that the folks that have been working on the Wiki have done.

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Again, the place that the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki is at,

466
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
orangeloungeradio.wiki, that's W-I-K-I-A dot com,

467
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and just to give you an idea of what's there,

468
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and this is all the listeners that have been doing this.

469
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This is incredible.

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They have a page of like inside jokes from the show

471
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
that includes like the locust, tingle, bet,

472
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and just some of the other things that have come up on the show,

473
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and there's been...

474
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
They can hear the plane over the live feed right.

475
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Can they hear that on the podcast?

476
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They're hearing that on Justin TV.

477
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Probably Justin TV because the mic's right by the window.

478
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh yeah, because the window's open.

479
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, they probably can hear the plane outside.

480
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Okay, yes, we live by an Air Force base,

481
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
or it's not actually...

482
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It was an Air Force base.

483
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Air Force base.

484
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It used to be an Air Force base.

485
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It used to be an Air Force base.

486
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It was a CHP.

487
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, somebody's breaking the law.

488
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We don't live that far.

489
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Sorry.

490
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Isn't it now like a business airport is what they use at Fort primarily?

491
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Like FedEx?

492
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And air shows.

493
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah, and air shows.

494
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh God, the air shows.

495
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh God.

496
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I mean, the Blue Angels kind of get old to me after the first couple times,

497
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and they're so loud.

498
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I used to go see the Blue Angels when I was a kid, okay?

499
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's how fucking old they are.

500
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's just really...

501
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
No, we've always lived by the airport,

502
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
but now it's just tonight the window's open because it's hot here now,

503
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
so we have the fan on and the window open.

504
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, and I think it's bad now.

505
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We only get to like 110 outside.

506
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
By the way, I found out the information for you on an air conditioner.

507
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
All right, excellent.

508
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We'll talk about that later.

509
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's the reason why we can't afford Live 365.

510
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Because we need an air conditioner.

511
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We just have, you know.

512
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
All right, enough about the plane.

513
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay, where the hell was I?

514
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I was talking about the inside jokes, and they've compiled...

515
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay, get this.

516
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There's a list of every single Orange Lounge radio episode,

517
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
at least the two go in podcast editions,

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and like Dark Tetsuya or somebody went through,

519
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't know if this is everybody,

520
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
they actually listed what happened on every single episode.

521
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's nuts.

522
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And then like Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week,

523
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
an entire archive of the Classic Game of the Week is up there.

524
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Which helps me tremendously.

525
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yes, because now she won't repeat anything on accident.

526
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Exactly, because I was actually looking at the game I picked today,

527
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
goes, I've mentioned this so much, should I already do it?

528
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So we'll find out what that game is a little later on.

529
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And we'll see, it'll be a race to see who can add it to the wiki first,

530
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
what the game is tonight.

531
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So we'll get to that a little later in the show.

532
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
All right, but let's get to some gaming news.

533
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Too much housekeeping and stuff tonight.

534
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
We need to get into the thick of it with some gaming news.

535
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So, Loki, please start us off.

536
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So this week, well actually I should say,

537
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
it hasn't come out yet, but they announced,

538
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Sony has announced that a new firmware update

539
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
will be coming to the PS3 that's going to add Blu-ray Profile 2.0 support,

540
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
which I think is better known as BD Live.

541
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And it will allow you to do different things with your movies,

542
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
including they'll have additional downloadable interactive content,

543
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
as well as like interactive games with leaderboards and that kind of stuff.

544
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
All stuff that you can kind of throw together on a Blu-ray disc,

545
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
which is pretty cool.

546
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Some other cool stuff that they're enhancing,

547
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
you'll be able to play DivX in Windows Media files larger than two gigabytes.

548
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Also the music and photo playlist can be exported from the PS3 to the PSP.

549
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
DVDs and Blu-rays will resume playback for the moment you last stopped them.

550
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The PSP can be used as a remote control to play music on the PS3.

551
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And the web browser will feature a faster page loading times

552
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
with the ability to save links and stream linked videos.

553
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
That's pretty cool.

554
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And also I guess another thing they call mosquito noise reduction

555
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
will be added to AV control panel for Blu-rays and DVDs.

556
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't know what the fuck that last part is, but I'm sure someone out there does.

557
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I have no idea what that means either.

558
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What was that called? Mosquito?

559
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Mosquito noise reduction.

560
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
My guess may be like...

561
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Is that to like filter out the planes that fly by while you're watching the movies?

562
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't know about that. Maybe like line humming or something like that.

563
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It removes like the hum off the line.

564
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Interesting. Well, I thought Blu-ray was supposed to be like perfect anyway.

565
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What the hell is there doing line noise?

566
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Your Blu-ray may be perfect, but your theater setup may not be perfect.

567
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Ah, I see. Okay. All right.

568
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And my God, that sun is so fucking bright through that window.

569
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm just like blinded by that.

570
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm sure the Just2TV people that are watching us on there can see,

571
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
but as we're taping, you know, just the way the sun is.

572
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm just fine.

573
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The sun is shining like right on Loki and I during the entirety of tonight's show.

574
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm hiding in shadows.

575
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yes, we know Dark Soccer. We know.

576
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You know what? Why don't you just like duct tape a towel up there?

577
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Nah, it's cool.

578
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Loki's just re-situating.

579
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
See, what will be funny is that then later the sun will move slowly and hit you in the eyes again.

580
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Isn't it going that way?

581
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Well, like last week it kind of went down after a while.

582
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's shining through the last window right now anyway.

583
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Constant exposure to your eyes will eventually give me a headache.

584
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yes.

585
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And I'm already starting to get one.

586
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Maybe that's why I had a headache earlier. I don't know.

587
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Stories.

588
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
All right. Anyway, sorry.

589
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So the PlayStation 3 is not the only thing getting a firmware upgrade,

590
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you know, for the whole Blu-ray 2.0 or whatever you want to call it.

591
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
PSP just got a new firmware. It got the 3.93 firmware.

592
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It just rolled out recently.

593
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's not a whole lot of new stuff.

594
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's 20 brand new players in the internet radio feature, and that's really it.

595
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Although I imagine it probably closed some loopholes in the hacking world,

596
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
but my other question would be, has this already been hacked, Loki?

597
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
No, it hasn't because really all it did was add just those 20 stations,

598
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
so they have a workaround to add those 20 stations if you want,

599
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
but otherwise they're not worrying about cracking it because it's basically just that.

600
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh.

601
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It seems a little silly to do a whole firmware upgrade just to add.

602
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Those better be 20 damn good stations.

603
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
20 damn good stations better be in there.

604
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We'll see.

605
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't know, does 3Speech have their own radio station? I'm sure.

606
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
No, I think all games where we're syndicated on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings,

607
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I think they're on there, so that's all you really need, right?

608
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We're not on there because Live 365 doesn't go on ShoutKastV,

609
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
so we've been paying all that money. Why?

610
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Well, we can't even get listed on PSPs.

611
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh, forget it. It's old hat now.

612
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Things are going to be changing soon.

613
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I have two words for that.

614
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh, AlphaKantagram says it's not stations, it's players.

615
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So I guess I'm what, like different skins and stuff?

616
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Well, that's even lamer.

617
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah.

618
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Tony players.

619
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
RasteelUT says OLR should be on 3Speech Radio.

620
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That would be fun.

621
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Then we could talk about all the great things in the Sony world and nothing else.

622
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Let's talk about all the good things in the Sony world.

623
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And our show would be only five minutes long.

624
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Hey, I have some great things in the Sony world to talk about.

625
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
All right, then please do share.

626
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
More like Sony being fucking stupid.

627
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Ha ha.

628
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No, basically EA put out a patch for the Orange Box on PS3

629
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that's supposed to address these problems with connectivity and frame rate issues

630
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and slow loading times, but they haven't put out any other documentation

631
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
to really say what else it's supposed to do.

632
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And the thing is like 128 meg.

633
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So it's kind of big.

634
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And no one else really knows what else it does.

635
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And the whole thing is it's not really Valve that did it.

636
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's from their third party, so whatever.

637
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Well, at least it's not like, I was going to say like Bully got patched recently

638
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and apparently the patch didn't do anything.

639
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
See, Valve, this is what you get for having software on PlayStation 3.

640
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I don't know, RustyOUT in chat says the patch does nothing.

641
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Well, he said what the patch did.

642
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's just, I don't know.

643
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's supposed to do.

644
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Well, I am looking that up right now because I don't remember off the top of my head

645
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
because I don't own the PS3 version of the Orange Box.

646
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And you know me, I don't care about anybody but myself, so I don't know.

647
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't have the PS3 version either.

648
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I have the Xbox 360 version.

649
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And keep in mind, the only version worth having is either PC or Xbox 360.

650
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
PlayStation 3 is, it's not meant to be online.

651
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Well, I mean, let's not get mad at them.

652
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I mean, who cares?

653
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Okay, the PS3 version, they maybe didn't program it just quite right.

654
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Well, we actually had a discussion on that earlier today

655
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
about which version of Bionic Commando we were going to get.

656
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And Dan was pretty much saying that even though it's going to be scaled back for resolution,

657
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
we're talking about getting the Xbox 360 version because there will be more people online to play with.

658
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I guess that's true.

659
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And I don't know if they're going to actually scale it back resolution-wise.

660
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I mean, after all, they did allow them to break the barrier for Street Fighter 2 HD Turbo Remix,

661
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
whatever the fuck it's called now.

662
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I think that that was the last announced thing, though, that they were having to scale it back

663
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
because the game wasn't quite working at the full resolution.

664
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm sure Microsoft will let them bend the rules a little bit to make it work with a big game like that.

665
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay.

666
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Anyways, since we've wasted enough time, now I can tell you what was in that patch.

667
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
They fixed graphical issues where a player would have the explosion effect

668
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
left on the end of their rocket launcher while attempting to rocket jump.

669
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Some memory leaks fixed an issue where the player's name would not appear on the stats comparison screen.

670
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
There's an issue that would cause the vote tallies to disappear when you viewed a scoreboard between rounds.

671
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Online server issue.

672
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Let's see here.

673
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
An issue with players not always being added to the player's menu and across media bar.

674
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Fixed a bug where a player viewing a friend without an EA account

675
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
would have an empty entry in their friend's leaderboard.

676
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Fixed an issue where it was not possible to connect to EA servers if you have more than 30 friends.

677
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Sounds like they fixed a lot of issues, but nothing really important like frame rate issues

678
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
or anything that really needed to be fixed.

679
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Huh, unfortunate.

680
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Speaking of Valve, you know what I checked out?

681
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Finally, after all this time, and I know some of you guys are going to be like,

682
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh my God, Rob, you're behind the times.

683
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I finally downloaded and checked out Steam this week after all this time.

684
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It's a nice little front-end program.

685
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It kind of reminds me of X-Fire, but with game purchases available inside it.

686
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And I actually thought about getting Portal just so I can have it on the computer

687
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
because I'm a sucker for that game as a lot of people are, what can I say?

688
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So other cool stuff that's happening this week.

689
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I believe Famitsu Magazine, I want to say they were leaked out.

690
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I wouldn't really say leaked out, but they had Persona 4 covered in there.

691
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I guess it was their exclusive with a bonus DVD with a bunch of screenshots and movies

692
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and all sorts of stuff from the new game.

693
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Apparently, Persona 4 is coming to Japan in July.

694
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Interesting enough, it's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 and not the PS3.

695
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So that's pretty cool.

696
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And it looks, to me, I think it looks a hundred times better than Persona 3.

697
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So I'm sure a lot of people will be very happy about that.

698
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No word of what's coming over to the U.S.,

699
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
but seeing as they've brought over Persona 3 and Persona 3 FES,

700
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
it makes perfect sense that they would actually bring it over.

701
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Absolutely, and with Persona 3 getting the cult-ish style acclaim that it has over here,

702
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I mean, Persona 3, definitely those that have played it have really enjoyed the game,

703
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and I keep getting people telling me that I should play that game lots.

704
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm just surprised though, because the screenshots I saw, or at least the pictures,

705
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I think a lot of that was from the full motion video in there, which is all anime.

706
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But it looked to me almost like a PlayStation 3 game,

707
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
but I guess it's PlayStation 2, which is, hey, awesome.

708
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That is pretty interesting that they're packing all that in a PlayStation 2 game,

709
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
you know what I mean?

710
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That they're still cranking them out for the quote-unquote old system,

711
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
but, you know, I guess still tons and tons of PS2s out there,

712
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
it's still one of the better selling game systems, eh?

713
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah.

714
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Why not?

715
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I guess it makes sense.

716
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Well, another game that folks are looking forward to,

717
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
not just on the PlayStation 3, but on the Xbox 360, is Street Fighter IV,

718
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and it seems like little bits and pieces of Street Fighter IV news

719
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
come out every week to keep this game on the blog radar and on places like our show,

720
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and it works brilliantly, because, you know,

721
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
there's some interesting news this week that has been announced,

722
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and that is that it has some more in common with Street Fighter II.

723
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
This game is starting to sound more and more like just another like Street Fighter II port,

724
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
but just like completely new graphics and everything.

725
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Really? Just like Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.

726
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Well, but yet, you know, it's got the whole, it's 3D-ish element,

727
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and, you know, the whole new characters and all that,

728
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,000
so, you know, the fighter guy and the, what was her name, Crimson Viper, whatever her name was,

729
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
so there's some, I think it'll be very cool,

730
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
but the news that was announced this week is that not only are there some small,

731
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
you know, cosmetic changes in the game and da-da-da,

732
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
but that the old combos will work exactly the same way in the new game,

733
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and that means the old combos from Street Fighter II.

734
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So, and if you use, like, if you got, you know, a Guile combo down that you used to use in Street Fighter II,

735
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
apparently you can use them in Street Fighter IV as well.

736
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Interesting.

737
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Obviously, I'm assuming it doesn't end there, and you can, there's all sorts of new combos and things as well,

738
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
but kind of interesting that those folks that were, you know, experts at Street Fighter II will be a leg up already on Street Fighter IV.

739
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Awesome. All the more reason for me not to play this game. Why?

740
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It was in the arcade.

741
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Makes me long for, uh, Co-Co-Co-Combo Breaker.

742
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:45,280
Dude, I love Killer

743
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But that's just, have you ever played against, though, one of those people who are just, like, the combo people?

744
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's painful.

745
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You know, strangely enough, not so much in Street Fighter II, but in Mortal Kombat, I used to get those people all the time, and it used to piss me off.

746
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I was one of those people on the beta version, though, just because I learned the Kitana's Infinite combo.

747
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Which was funny, because people get mad. Anyway, speaking of pain...

748
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I gotta say this real quick in chat, Rob D. says, uh, there's no way they could get away with skipping those combos.

749
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
This is nothing new. They never change mechanics that much.

750
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
True, but when you consider the age of Street Fighter II, you know what I mean?

751
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's kinda, kinda cool.

752
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Can I get on with the pain?

753
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You may. Bring on the pain.

754
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Well, pain is gonna be on Playstation Network, at least for the PAL PSN, for 4.99 pounds.

755
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Basically, it's a game where you throw stuff for points.

756
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I can't really describe it much else than that.

757
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Didn't you buy pain?

758
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
No.

759
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I thought you did.

760
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I have not bought anything. Well, other than Flow, I bought that on there.

761
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But other than that, I have not bought a game on the PSN, because I do not like their payment method.

762
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's like jackass in the game.

763
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't like using real money. I like points.

764
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Sorry, Jamie.

765
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Basically, the whole point of pain is that, you know, you're causing misfortune in people, and people grow up and laugh at them.

766
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
They get laughed at, so basically that's sort of what pain is about.

767
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Anyway, to get back to the story, there are also additional packs that are 69 pence each,

768
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and it will be the Scurvedog, Muffy, Santa, Hunglo, Ginger, Cookie, and Fun with Explosives packs.

769
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The last one is supposed to be a freebie.

770
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You know, but any game that combines Santa and Fun with Explosives, you think would be Instant Win, so I don't know.

771
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
If I had a band, it would be named Fun with Explosives.

772
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Really?

773
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But also, the store also has the Shranglehold pack for $9.99.

774
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
That's, again, in pounds.

775
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That has multiplayer maps.

776
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It actually should be the one that they got on Xbox Live.

777
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You should see if that name is taken in Rock Band.

778
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Fun with Explosives.

779
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Well, if not, then I would be stealing the one from clerks that Dan came up with this morning.

780
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What's that?

781
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Making Fuck.

782
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's probably taken.

783
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I wouldn't doubt it.

784
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I think I have the name Emergency Kittens, but there's no one in the band, so whatever.

785
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Anyhow, let's move on to some release dates for other things coming out around the world in the regular stores, the big box stores.

786
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yes.

787
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
This week, we've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

788
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Of course, winding down a little bit until we get to Mario Kart and Grand Theft Auto.

789
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But in the US, we've got Dark Sector coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

790
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Also this week, Viking Battle for Asgard, that's also coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

791
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Just a little game here on the PSP, Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core.

792
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That'll be coming out as well this week.

793
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Probably one of the biggest releases on the PSP for a while at least.

794
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Also this week, we've got Opuna on the Wii, that's that Koei RPG that you can actually control the entire game with the nunchuck only.

795
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm actually very curious to check out Opuna.

796
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I definitely want to check out that game.

797
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:52,000
There's a little budget puzzle game called Octomania, $19.99 for this game, and you can play it online with other people.

798
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So that's not bad at all.

799
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Also this week, Naruto the Ultimate Ninja 3 on PlayStation 2.

800
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Obscure the Aftermath on PlayStation 2 and the Wii.

801
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Let's see here, a really crappy game called Backyard Baseball 2009 for the DS.

802
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I don't know what number release this is this year, but one of the billion releases for Harvest Moon this year with Harvest Moon DS Cute.

803
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
That's going to be coming out on the DS.

804
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword also on the DS.

805
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That'll be fun too.

806
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Does Ninja Gaiden still have the epic cinema scenes like the old school games have?

807
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm not sure.

808
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
God, I hope so on the DS.

809
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
But the whole game is controlled with the stylus, so that's pretty cool.

810
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And let's see here, we've also got some more crap here.

811
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I guess, oh, this is also coming out on the 31st.

812
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Monokhemia Alchemist of Alrivis, and that is a new RPG by Koei as well.

813
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And that's pretty much it.

814
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah, for right now.

815
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I know next week there's absolutely shit coming out, so enjoy it while you laugh.

816
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Alrighty, well let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases that will be coming out in Japan very soon.

817
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:31,000
On the Xbox 360, you get Dark Sector comes out, as well as Raiden Fighters Aces and Tomb Raider Anniversary all come out in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.

818
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Also, a DVD lens cleaner, if you needed one of those for your Xbox 360.

819
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
On the PlayStation 3, also a DVD lens cleaner.

820
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Imagine that.

821
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Hori's cranking out the DVD cleaning.

822
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I guess folks are getting their PlayStations and Xboxes dirty over there.

823
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Also, Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga, and after all this time, Japan, I know you've really been waiting for this on PlayStation 3,

824
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The Golden Compass finally gets its port on the PlayStation 3 over in Japan, or as they call it, Lira Nobuken.

825
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
That's the name of it.

826
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Coming out on other systems on the Nintendo Wii, Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga also on the Nintendo Wii.

827
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Ninja Reflex Nitro Bike makes its way out of there.

828
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Here's a spoiler for Japan, Nitro Bike sucks.

829
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And how do you know that?

830
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Because I played it, and it sucks.

831
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What sucks about it?

832
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You can't say a game sucks without telling us what sucks about it.

833
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The game sucks, the graphics are horrible, the polygons and textures are low-res, the game controls like crap,

834
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and it's trying to be Excite Truck, except it's nowhere near Excite Truck.

835
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I got it for Nelly because I thought, hey, this looks like an Excite Truck.

836
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It's got rockets and everything, and it's created by the people at the Excite Bike 64.

837
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
What could be bad about it?

838
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Well, apparently a lot, so that's why it sucks.

839
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
GS68, by the way, refers to one of the earlier titles we mentioned in the chat.

840
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
He says, Golden Cump Ass, get it?

841
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Golden Cump Ass.

842
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
PlayStation 2 sees Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus comes out,

843
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
as well as Neo Angelique Full Voice in a premium box and a super premium box,

844
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
as well as the original comes out.

845
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Silent Hill Origins makes its way to some Asian regions this week,

846
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
but Korea's the only one we see mentioned, so be sure to check.

847
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It might be a little bit longer before it makes its way to Japan.

848
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Nobunaga no Yabu Online comes out in Japan this week as well.

849
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Lots of fun stuff.

850
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Let's see real quickly what's coming out on the handheld systems.

851
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
On the Nintendo DS, we have Business Ryokukente DS comes out.

852
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Katakushi Hitman Reborn, Bongoshiki Taisen Battle Sugoruku comes out.

853
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Baseball game.

854
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I like that it says Hitman Reborn in it in the middle of it, though.

855
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Kind of makes me think of a different type of game.

856
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Maybe it's baseball with Hitman. That would be fun.

857
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
No.

858
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
They need Battlefield Baseball. That would be pretty awesome.

859
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Let's see, Simple DS series gets volume 35, the Genshin this week.

860
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Lost in Blue 2 gets a price reduction, and Mobile Suit Gundam 00 comes out.

861
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Mina de Flash Anzen DS, Mina no Atsumare Quiz Party comes out,

862
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and wait for it, the Golden Compass on Nintendo DS.

863
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
PSP, check in real quick to see if anything's coming out of note there.

864
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G, that might be kind of cool,

865
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
as well as Tomb Raider Anniversary comes out on the Sony PSP.

866
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That's it for Japan.

867
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
That's all.

868
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Okay, well, I have for our UK listeners another set of release dates.

869
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
We have on the 27th, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

870
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You've heard us talk about this, so don't worry about it.

871
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The Golden Horde on PC.

872
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
On the 28th, we have Coded Arms Contagion, Football Manager 2008,

873
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
God of War Chains of Olympus, King of Clubs,

874
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution,

875
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Powershot Pinball Constructor, which sounds pretty fun, that's on DS,

876
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on Wii, Sega Bass Fishing,

877
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Universe at War Earth Assault, Viking Battle for Asgard,

878
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Warriors of the Lost Empire, Warriors Orochi on PC and PSP,

879
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and Worms Space Oddity.

880
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That would be it.

881
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Coming out here not very soon, but soon enough,

882
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
in June, Activision actually announced that they will be bringing

883
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Guitar Hero on tour to the Nintendo DS.

884
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Now, you may be wondering, how the hell are they going to do that?

885
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Well, there's actually a brand new peripheral that they're releasing along with it,

886
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
called the Guitar Grip.

887
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It has four fret buttons and a wonderful little hand strap to put your hand through.

888
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So, you use that just like you would, you know, the fret buttons on an actual guitar,

889
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
and then you strum on the touchscreen with a stylus,

890
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
or actually a pick stylus that comes with the game to do that kind of stuff.

891
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And, of course, you know, plays just like Guitar Hero.

892
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's supposed to have 20 songs, or more than 20 songs in the game,

893
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and 80% of the songs will be original master recordings.

894
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So, that's pretty cool.

895
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
If my memory serves me right, it's $49.99, comes out June 22nd.

896
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh, just in time for my birthday!

897
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
By the way, they've wasted no time in whoring this game to the masses.

898
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I don't know if you guys ever visit yahoo.com, like just, you know, out of the blue,

899
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
but it's one of the pages I'll go to, you know, for, like, news and search and stuff.

900
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And there's a little flash ad that pops right up there.

901
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's already whoring the Guitar Hero on tour.

902
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Oh, yeah.

903
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
They're wasting no time.

904
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And I would recommend pre-ordering this if you're really interested in it,

905
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
because, like most other Activision games that include peripherals,

906
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
especially brand new peripherals that they're breaking ground on,

907
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
this thing will be hard to find.

908
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Frisbee asks, is anyone honestly going to buy this crap?

909
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I actually have mine pre-ordered already.

910
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm considering it.

911
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But I'm not going to probably play it, because that's what I do.

912
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It looks interesting.

913
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm interested enough where I at least want to play it.

914
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't know if I want to drop, what, you said $49.95?

915
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
$49.99.

916
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I don't know if I want to drop $50 on it, especially if it's only 20 songs.

917
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But I'm interested in, like, checking it out.

918
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I don't know. I think it's neat.

919
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I don't think it would be that difficult if it's only four buttons

920
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
if I can already play five button mode on the, uh...

921
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Dude, Konami really missed out, man.

922
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
They could have done Guitar Freeze with three buttons.

923
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Mm, I've been saying that for a long time. Just saying.

924
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
All right.

925
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Well, I'm interested. Actually, I'm interested.

926
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Let me ask chat.

927
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
How many folks in chat are interested in picking this game up,

928
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Guitar Hero on tour?

929
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Quick, quick poll of chat,

930
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
because I imagine most of you that own DSes or, you know,

931
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
or if you don't own a DS, imagine you did.

932
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Would you pick up this game?

933
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And Frisbee says, please just smack yourself.

934
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Elite Beat Agents.

935
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Okay, thanks.

936
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Oh, I feel so sorry for Elite Beat Agents.

937
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I was in Fry's the other day, and that game's, like, on clearance.

938
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah.

939
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Tons and tons of copies.

940
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You can't buy it anymore, actually. It's kind of sad.

941
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So sad. That game is awesome.

942
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But, you know, hey, and here's the thing,

943
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
and I don't know if you should start getting worried about this or not,

944
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
but they're really whoring Guitar Hero out.

945
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I mean, Activision, I don't know if they're going to drive it into the ground or what,

946
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
but, I mean, we've got, actually, literally a week after this,

947
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith coming out.

948
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Then you've got Guitar Hero 4,

949
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and who knows how many other shit, you know,

950
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
games that they're going to throw in the middle there.

951
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
They're really whoring that franchise out,

952
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and, I mean, and people are kind of really buying into it, unfortunately.

953
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Alright, let's look at our instant poll results in Chat Room.

954
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I'm not going to read the nickname since that'll take me too long,

955
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
but really quickly, here's some of the comments.

956
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Question was, are you going to buy Guitar Hero on Tour DS?

957
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm not. Zero percent. No. No. Not me.

958
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Just get a PSP and DJ Max.

959
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Depends on the song list. Maybe.

960
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Only for the peripheral to make it easier to play Puzzle League.

961
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Strap for the win.

962
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
If the game has songs I like, I might download, I mean, pick it up.

963
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I may get it if they guarantee cheap expansion pack song cards minus peripheral.

964
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Never ever ever ever.

965
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I will purchase Guitar Hero on Tour after I'm done burning $100 bills.

966
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
No. Nope. You'd look like a damn fool playing it.

967
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No. No. Not ripped off.

968
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And, Con.

969
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
There's your instant poll results.

970
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Well, I was just thinking, I mean, this is a good game for kids,

971
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
especially when you're taking them on the road and stuff.

972
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
They can play their Guitar Hero with headphones on in the car

973
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and not bug Mommy and Daddy while they're driving to Grandma's house.

974
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Yeah, I think, again, the soccer moms are going to make or break this game.

975
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Really, I think is what it's going to be.

976
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I think you're absolutely right.

977
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's a great game to just give to your kids.

978
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Give your kids some headphones in the game,

979
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
and look, you can play Guitar Hero in the car. Have fun.

980
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Shut up.

981
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Really, the only reason I'm buying it is so we can show it on the show.

982
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That's pretty much the only reason.

983
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh, don't waste your money.

984
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Well, hey, just because I ordered it doesn't mean I'm going to actually buy it, okay?

985
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Because I don't have to.

986
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I just put it on order to kind of hold my spot.

987
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
RosteelUT says,

988
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Loki, you're high. They'll bug Mommy even more with this game by singing along.

989
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
No, maybe my wife would do that, but, you know.

990
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Just don't put songs with words in them. There you go.

991
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
All right.

992
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It's your mental only.

993
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Let's go into more lawsuit news from Gibson.

994
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
We already kind of talked about this last week,

995
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
but if you can believe it, even more lawsuits coming out from Gibson.

996
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You remember Gibson sued Activision.

997
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
They sued Harmonix last week, all over the fact that Gibson says

998
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
they have had a patent for electronic guitars for quite some time.

999
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And get this, this week, now they've sued GameStop, Walmart, Target, Kmart, Amazon, Toys R Us,

1000
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
all these major retailers that sell Guitar Hero games,

1001
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
seeking basically to stop the sale of the games.

1002
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Did you see they also sued EA, even though EA doesn't make Guitar Hero at all?

1003
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
It's crazy, yeah.

1004
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I was going to say, in the next piece here, they sued Harmonix, Viacom, and EA now as well.

1005
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Just because, I guess, they want to sue as many people as possible.

1006
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I don't understand this. This makes no sense at all.

1007
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I don't know. They're looking for money.

1008
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
But why would you sue the retailers to get them to try to stop selling the game?

1009
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Because they're trying to make a big stink.

1010
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
They're trying to make a big stink and seeing who will give them money.

1011
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Loki says the EA suit is over Rock Band.

1012
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I don't know if it's over Rock Band, because they mention Guitar Hero in the lawsuit.

1013
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's not Rock Band.

1014
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Is it because now Harmonix is a part of...

1015
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Oh no, I guess it was just an agreement. I don't know.

1016
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That just sucks. Let's sue everything.

1017
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I like that comment from Gerardimo in chat.

1018
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Well, you've got to wonder, is this Gibson thing legitimate or not?

1019
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
There's actually an analyst out there.

1020
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Of course, we love analysts.

1021
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
This is actually a legal analyst working for Wedbush Morgan.

1022
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
He's an analyst.

1023
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
He says this about the lawsuits.

1024
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Michael Pastors' name.

1025
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
This is a poorly masked attempt to extort money.

1026
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
They are using any way they can to have Activision write them a check.

1027
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Seriously, this is the third game.

1028
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Well, the third major release of the game that's been out so far.

1029
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I think at one time they had Gibson guitars in the game, I want to say.

1030
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I don't know. I may be wrong.

1031
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
How could they not be aware that they're violating the patent?

1032
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I mean, oh, wait a second.

1033
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
This is a guitar game? How retarded are they?

1034
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I would say the fact that the Gibson guitars were in the game should negate the whole damn thing,

1035
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
because they've known this that long, and they made that agreement.

1036
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Now they're absolutely after burning themselves.

1037
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And if we want to really draw straws,

1038
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
they weren't the first ones to come up with the whole guitar game thing anyways.

1039
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
It was Konami, and if I remember correctly,

1040
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I thought Activision was licensing the rights to use that from Konami,

1041
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and not Gibson.

1042
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
They're just...

1043
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
All I gotta say is the next fucking guitar games you guys put out,

1044
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
just forget about Gibson.

1045
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
There's plenty of other guitar manufacturers out there you can license guitars for.

1046
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Well, anyhow, this news I know makes me angsty every time I hear about this,

1047
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
and I'm sure you guys feel the same way.

1048
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

1049
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:30,000
...

1050
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Well, I guess Fly 365 goes without saying,

1051
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
so I'm not gonna really go too much in depth on that.

1052
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But FU2 having way too many people in the house

1053
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
when I had a doffy to work on,

1054
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I suddenly got her blushed,

1055
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and I haven't finished with the rest of the face.

1056
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
FU2 basically being kind of middle income,

1057
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
because we make too much money to be able to afford some of these low-income,

1058
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
first-time buyer loan programs,

1059
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
but we don't make enough to really afford a decent house.

1060
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So people who actually make less than us can afford a nicer house.

1061
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I don't know. That fucking sucks.

1062
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
FU2 Live 365 goes without saying.

1063
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
In fact, I think when this show comes back in a non-Live 365 place,

1064
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
we should actually probably rename this segment to the Live 365 Memorial FUs of the Week.

1065
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That might be fun.

1066
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Also, I want to give an FU2 the CAT scan I had on Thursday.

1067
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
It was so miserable.

1068
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Look, I still have a bruise from where they gave me the little shot thingy,

1069
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
or the iodine thing.

1070
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I was so miserable.

1071
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I reacted so bad to it.

1072
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Yeah, I had to have a CAT scan,

1073
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
because I'm still having those pains that I've been having,

1074
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and they're not going away, which sucks.

1075
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And I don't get the results back till Monday,

1076
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
so FU2 waiting.

1077
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
That sucks.

1078
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It does suck.

1079
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'll tell you what, though.

1080
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
This is the best diet I've ever been on.

1081
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I'll eat a couple things, and I get extremely full.

1082
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It's like I had gastric bypass or something,

1083
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
without having to pay for it.

1084
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
It's great.

1085
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
All right, that does it for the FUs of the Week.

1086
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Let's get back to some gaming news.

1087
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Wow, we have almost a whole segment of music game news, don't we, Jamie?

1088
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Yeah, how's that?

1089
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Right before they're screwing us over.

1090
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Anyway, MTV has said that they've sold more than 6 million, I think,

1091
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
songs in Rock Band as downloadable content.

1092
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So now Harmonics is bringing in the Rock Band music store

1093
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

1094
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:55,000
so that you can actually download your songs in-game without leaving the game.

1095
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:04,000
And so you can sort them by artist, genre, album, title, pack, and other ways, too.

1096
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
There's album art.

1097
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
You can listen to song previews and difficulty levels.

1098
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And the patch is actually supposed to be out this week.

1099
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Or maybe it's already out.

1100
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah, the patch is already out.

1101
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Didn't you say that you...

1102
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I did, and it's lots of fun.

1103
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Sorry, I just... he's eating toast.

1104
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I know.

1105
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I give that F.U. to not being able to eat, and then I'm eating.

1106
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Excuse me, sorry.

1107
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So yeah, I did download the music store,

1108
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
and it's actually kind of cool because you get the little album art,

1109
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and then you can download the song previews now.

1110
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So if you're not sure exactly what a song is,

1111
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I think I've heard that song, but I'm not sure.

1112
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You can download the little song previews, and it stays on there.

1113
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So when you're scrolling in the list in the future, you can kind of hear it,

1114
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
like it was DDR or something.

1115
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Especially the music store kind of looks like a DDR selection screen to me.

1116
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I don't know.

1117
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I like the fact that you can actually preview the songs,

1118
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
something that I thought should have been on there in the first place

1119
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
instead of having to buy these songs blindly

1120
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
unless you have a YouTube link where you can watch the video

1121
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
or listen to the song.

1122
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I think that's smart.

1123
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I think the whole thing was smart because I realized there were songs in there

1124
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I wanted that I didn't realize I didn't have.

1125
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Yeah, because it's hard sometimes,

1126
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
especially when you recognize a song on the radio by the song,

1127
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
not necessarily by the title,

1128
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
or you might not even know who the artist is.

1129
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You just recognize the song.

1130
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Press Start in Chat agrees with us.

1131
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The previews in Rock Band are evil.

1132
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I downloaded like three more songs because of them.

1133
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
There you have it.

1134
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Well, there was a little bit more that I saw about them trying to add more features

1135
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
that were based off of requests by the community, so that's pretty cool.

1136
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It's supposed to be new content every week through 2008, so that's pretty cool.

1137
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That's, of course, only in the U.S. right now.

1138
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That's pretty cool.

1139
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You know what I'm surprised they don't have yet is vision camera support

1140
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
or camera support to basically film yourself doing your little rock concert shit

1141
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
in front of your TV or whatever with your friends

1142
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
and then posting it like a YouTube thing

1143
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
with some sort of contest maybe lumped in with that,

1144
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
although at the same time I'm kind of glad they don't have that

1145
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
because that would be a motivation for some other people

1146
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
to try to get me to do things I don't want to do.

1147
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Let's see here.

1148
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,000
This week we've got a new download pack coming to Rock Band.

1149
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It's actually six songs from Boston and quite a few that you'll probably like here,

1150
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
including, let's see here,

1151
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Hitch a Ride, More Than a Feelin',

1152
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Peace of Mind, Rock and Roll Band, Smokin' and Something About You.

1153
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So that's pretty cool.

1154
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And you can buy that in a pack for 800 Microsoft points or $10

1155
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
or individually for 160 Microsoft points or $1.99 each.

1156
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So you save $2 if you buy it all.

1157
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Whatever happened to you getting that Rock Band stage kit?

1158
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
When is it not out yet?

1159
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
When does that come out?

1160
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
June.

1161
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
June?

1162
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah.

1163
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
We're going to have to wait that long to rock

1164
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and we won't even be able to do it on Live 365?

1165
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That sucks.

1166
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Is that right?

1167
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It's one of those things that we need to have a camera for

1168
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
so we can see the entire garage being filled with smoke.

1169
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Here's a little clip of Boston if you actually need a reminder.

1170
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's the same song that's in Guitar Hero.

1171
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And I think it's also in Cariote Revolution.

1172
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Boston is great.

1173
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Boston is pretty awesome.

1174
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I'm telling you though, I want my Queen pack, my Journey pack.

1175
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Where's my Journey pack?

1176
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I need me some Queen because that'd be awesome.

1177
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
The Queen pack would be epic.

1178
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And also, you know what else we need?

1179
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
We need some really kick-ass hardcore industrial stuff.

1180
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Get some bands that aren't around anymore, like Gravity Kills.

1181
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
That should be awesome.

1182
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
How about Tracy Lords?

1183
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
That'd be awesome too.

1184
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I love Tracy Lords.

1185
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
She apparently sucks live.

1186
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I'm sure she does.

1187
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
She sucks on tape too.

1188
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
She was funny in Crusty Baby.

1189
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Oh yeah, I love Tracy Lords as an actress.

1190
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Good stuff, wasn't she?

1191
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Well yes, she was on the NBC show.

1192
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Was it The Pretenders for the longest time?

1193
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I thought you were talking about it before.

1194
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
No, I'm not that type of actress.

1195
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Although, sure, people everywhere can appreciate her fine work there.

1196
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Something else you folks can appreciate is Free Stuff.

1197
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Who doesn't like Free Stuff?

1198
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
We don't if it's Yaris.

1199
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Well, this isn't Yaris.

1200
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It's actually on the Nintendo Wii.

1201
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It's sort of a, we're sorry, please forgive us type of thing.

1202
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Remember how the whole Wii Guitar Hero 3 on the Nintendo Wii only had the mono sound in it?

1203
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
And they have to do all these replacement discs for the stereo sound now?

1204
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Well, you're also going to be getting a Guitar Hero face plate.

1205
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
A free Guitar Hero face plate.

1206
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
It's actually kind of neat looking.

1207
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
It looks like fire a little bit.

1208
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
It's red and yellow and black and it looks like a phoenix kind of rising up from this fire-ish looking thing.

1209
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So, it's kind of cool.

1210
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And it's small black leather and it says, please don't sue us.

1211
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Please don't sue us.

1212
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Please no class action laws here.

1213
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
By accepting this face plate, you agree not to do a class action law show?

1214
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I don't know, Jamie, don't you think that looks kind of cool?

1215
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It looks better than the guitar I have in the living room.

1216
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1217
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Listen, I hate how the Wii mote goes in the guitar like that.

1218
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's so weird.

1219
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But I guess it makes sense and probably makes things cost less.

1220
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But anyway, free face plate for those of you that are going to be getting the replacement discs for Guitar Hero on the Wii.

1221
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I understand. It hijacks Wi-Fi like a college student in an apartment complex.

1222
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Can we please move on with the gaming news at this time?

1223
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Sure, why not?

1224
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:34,000
At least, you know, I would be more than happy to if my computer would decide that it would let me pull up the stupid file.

1225
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Sorry.

1226
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
There we go.

1227
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Got none at the time?

1228
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It's all you.

1229
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Anyway, especially know that there's quite a few really hardcore fans out there who are probably listening.

1230
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I can think of one in particular.

1231
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:08,000
They're actually saying that there may be another version, another song pack for Guitar Hero that would be all Beatles stuff.

1232
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And that's pretty cool, although I've been corrected as far as information in the article that their catalog cannot be distributed on iTunes because of a lawsuit going on between Apple and Apple Corp.

1233
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
So I'm not going to go into all that.

1234
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Read Wikipedia.

1235
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:40,000
But they said that they're trying to work about bringing a few songs out for a particular song pack, so I think that would be kind of cool.

1236
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Don't they have to get the rights back from Michael Jackson, or did he sell that stuff when he started becoming poor?

1237
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I'm not the expert.

1238
01:03:52,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Well, another bad idea sounds like something coming from Ubisoft with their brand new title in their Imagine series. Imagine, people actually buy this shit.

1239
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Imagine Rockstar.

1240
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
It is absolutely in no way a ripoff of Rockband, I'm sure.

1241
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And it kind of revolves around fashion and stuff.

1242
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:23,000
The Imagine series is meant for girls aged 6 to 14, or in the case of Jamie, she likes Imagine Babies.

1243
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And it will allow little girls, I guess, to be able to play drums, guitar, bass, and piano with each other via Wi-Fi.

1244
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And each instrument has its own unique control using the DS stylus, and players will be able to customize the look of each bandmate and create the most stylish rockers.

1245
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Only girls can play? That's not fair.

1246
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Fine, you too can play.

1247
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Yay!

1248
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And they work their way up the charts to become the number one recording band.

1249
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
How is that different from Rockband?

1250
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Don't you get to dress your characters in Rockband?

1251
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
You have to understand, this is shitty Rockband, not so crappy.

1252
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1253
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But if that's not for you, there's also, of course, the rest of the Imagine series, including Imagine Figure Skater, Imagine Fashion Designer, Imagine Animal Doctor, Imagine Master Chef, and Imagine Babies.

1254
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Imagine Master Chef.

1255
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Yeah, it's funny, if you read the Master Chef really fast, it's almost like Imagine Master Chief, and that's like, hey, wait a second.

1256
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I wonder if we could get the Imagine people on the show.

1257
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I mean, why not?

1258
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Let's hear them, I don't want to say defend themselves, but let's hear about their contributions to the gaming scene.

1259
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I make fun of them because it's not my demographic, but you know what, there is a problem with a lot of games not being focused towards girls, and so they are kind of working that market.

1260
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Same with UFO Interactive, they make a lot of these, was it Smart Boys Game Room, Smart Girls Dream House type thing like that, it's games that are aimed at kids that are three years old, like really get you hooked young.

1261
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Start them young.

1262
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Exactly, so it's nice that they're aiming for this demographic, obviously though it's easy fodder for us in the press to just kind of make fun of it because we don't understand it, and it's different.

1263
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Back in my day, we had Mario is Missing, and we liked it.

1264
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Mario is Missing was great, and besides that, I personally, for some of these, I don't really feel like perpetuating any type of stereotypical behavior or traditional roles, I think that it's up to...

1265
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It's just like when Nintendo tried Super Princess Peach, and that flopped, and so they said, fuck it, boys will play games, girls will do nothing.

1266
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I play games...

1267
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I like Super Princess Peach, screw you.

1268
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I like shooting things in games, it's like...

1269
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
You will play your Kirby and your Peach games and you will like them, that's it.

1270
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
No...

1271
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And now the chat room is just going off with all these different imagined things, but Amaze Hetsuma, I like this one, says, imagine these games in a landfill next to E.T.

1272
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I like violent games.

1273
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Frisbee says, Peach is awesome in Brawl, that's actually true, like the two characters I use most are Pit and Peach.

1274
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I don't like the fruit fruit games.

1275
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It's like the Peach Pit.

1276
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Get it? What?

1277
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I don't like fruit fruit games, why do you think I have to play fruit fruit games?

1278
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Cause it's funny.

1279
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I want Explosive Portal.

1280
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
That's the joke.

1281
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
No it's not.

1282
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Do you like Final Fantasy Tactics?

1283
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
No.

1284
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Well then this is not for you, Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is coming out on the Nintendo DS, and there are some folks that are big fans of Final Fantasy Tactics.

1285
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I like Final Fantasy Tactics, like the old one on the Playstation 1, I kind of lost the series since then, but this is definitely worth checking out as Final Fantasy Tactics A2, and it will be coming out June 24th is when this game is coming out.

1286
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Apparently this game has to do with the Ivalice Alliance, it's related a little more to the Final Fantasy XII series.

1287
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
A little bit I guess.

1288
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Check that out loosely.

1289
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Another way to whore that series even more.

1290
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Stop whoring your Final Fantasy series.

1291
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Final Fantasy XII was a good game.

1292
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Make one game, move to the next number.

1293
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
You do not need to expand upon this series in tax-dick games.

1294
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
And besides, I mean, I don't know, Revenant Wings, did you play much of that?

1295
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Not really.

1296
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Yeah, okay.

1297
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Cool, you can be the killer tomato in this game, or at least I think you fight the killer tomato, that's kind of cool.

1298
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
This game actually looks kind of rad.

1299
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I still need to beat Final Fantasy XII, though, and that other Final Fantasy game you bought me on DS, Loki.

1300
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Looks like fun.

1301
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I'm sure we'll be hearing from our listeners on this game.

1302
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Well, we hear from them about everything else.

1303
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I mean, hi!

1304
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,000
No, we know Codemasters, right?

1305
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
We're familiar with them.

1306
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Sure.

1307
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Codemasters Online Gaming basically said that they want to do two MMOs for home consoles.

1308
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
They were saying that they've had a little bit of success already in the market,

1309
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and so they're looking to bring stuff out for PlayStation 3.

1310
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
This is one of the ones listed, and they're saying that now is the right time to hop on it.

1311
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So there's not anything specific yet, but they said that they're really going to gear it for the consoles.

1312
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So I personally don't think MMOs work very well on consoles unless it's like, you know, PSO.

1313
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Here's what I'm hoping, and I know that they don't make this game, at least not Codemasters.

1314
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
APB, that game that's coming out that's just like Saints Row, but it's an MMO.

1315
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I hope to God that I don't have to pay month to month for that thing, because I really want to play it, like badly.

1316
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Well, most MMOs you do have to pay month to month for.

1317
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Yeah, but Guild Wars is out, and they really need to follow that line of thought there.

1318
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Everybody, look at Guild Wars. Look at it.

1319
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And there's a lot of games out there that are free to play, and you know, you buy download content.

1320
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
That's what they should do, just give out free games, and then I'll pay for download content later on.

1321
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Like Second Life?

1322
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
No, Second Life is stupid. That's like if I wanted to go pick up virtual horror.

1323
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
It is free, and you get what you pay for.

1324
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And you pay for your downloadable content.

1325
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Yes, but that's a game where you...

1326
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
You just described Second Life.

1327
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Okay, but Second Life is a bad example, because that game sucks.

1328
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And it's not really a game, it's just an addiction. It's like the MySpace of MMOs, okay?

1329
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But it does specifically do what you were suggesting.

1330
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Okay, it does, but it sucks at it.

1331
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So, what I'm trying to say though, there's like other games out there that are also free to play,

1332
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and most of them are Korean, because apparently they understand how to make a good MMO.

1333
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Or apparently Malaysian, like one of my friends is on...

1334
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yeah, go figure. Malaysia, you know, where a lot of piracy used to come out of,

1335
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
and yet they're making good games that are free.

1336
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I don't know. That's kind of weird.

1337
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
But I digress, so...

1338
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
There's kind of a little bit of a different topic here,

1339
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
but once again, and we haven't heard about this in a while,

1340
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Massachusetts now is considering the whole games as porn bill.

1341
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Apparently it's House Bill 1423, being dubbed of course as the games as porn bill,

1342
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
would use the rationale to prevent minors from buying violent games,

1343
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
because they're treating it the same as porn.

1344
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I don't understand this, because porn is way better than games.

1345
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Exactly.

1346
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Come on.

1347
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And the bill was drafted by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino,

1348
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
which if he's up for re-election, remember that when you're voting.

1349
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And with the assistance from, of course,

1350
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
well this right here is why the bill is bad in the first place,

1351
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Voldemort was the inspiration on that bill.

1352
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And of course, legislative sponsor,

1353
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Republican Linda, or I'm sorry,

1354
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Representative Linda Dorsina Forey,

1355
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
who happens to be a Democrat.

1356
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And of course, this thing,

1357
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
much like all the other ones in the past,

1358
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
will fail because it's not constitutional.

1359
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
But at the same time,

1360
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
what do we got to do to stop these people from wasting our tax dollars

1361
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
on these bills that they know they're going to fail?

1362
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
You know, it's like the fucking...

1363
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Is it so that when they re-run for office,

1364
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
they can say like, hey, I took a stand against this.

1365
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Yeah, it's really...

1366
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Video games are poisoning your children,

1367
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and I take a stand against this.

1368
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
My name is Rob, and I approve this message.

1369
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Well, great.

1370
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So it's really for their own personal gain,

1371
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
and it's still wasting taxpayers' money.

1372
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
All the more reason you should hate it.

1373
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I don't know.

1374
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Do our children really need to be protected from games?

1375
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I mean, do we really need the government to step in

1376
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
to tell our children what's okay to play?

1377
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I mean, are we that retarded?

1378
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I know some people are that retarded,

1379
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
but I would like to think that, you know,

1380
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
most of us are not that retarded.

1381
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Because if we're all that retarded,

1382
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
then who the hell are we going to elect in as president?

1383
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Hey, I promise you shiny things.

1384
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Okay, you got my vote.

1385
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I don't know.

1386
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Alrighty.

1387
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Well, we'll see...

1388
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I'm sure we'll hear about this game later when it fails.

1389
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Meanwhile...

1390
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Or the bill, not the game.

1391
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Meanwhile, we're going to get to the end of part A of our show here,

1392
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
but not before we pay a little respect to our elders in this segment.

1393
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
We always do every single week here on the program.

1394
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:19,000
It's Dark Sockra's classic video game of the week.

1395
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
So Dark Sockra, you've dug through the archives,

1396
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
you've verified this pick is not a duplicate per the wiki.

1397
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
What classic game should the kids be checking out this week?

1398
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Jackal!

1399
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Jackal is a great game because you drive tanks and blow up shit.

1400
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Best game ever.

1401
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And yes, I'm talking about the Nintendo version specifically.

1402
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
This is when the music is cool.

1403
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
How is that?

1404
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I used to play this game.

1405
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
It's like Akari Warriors, but you're in a jeep.

1406
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Yeah, this is the game that makes me think of that line from Hot Shots.

1407
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
War is fantastic.

1408
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But no, which I don't really believe.

1409
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
But anyway, I love Jackal just because...

1410
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Okay, I actually have memories of this game before my papa, who is my dad's dad.

1411
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Before he died, we would actually sit in front of the big screen TV.

1412
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And we're talking like, you know, early 90's style big screen.

1413
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
So this was a big deal.

1414
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Playing the Nintendo and playing Jackal with papa, that was great.

1415
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:29,000
But the game actually, it was an arcade released in Japan.

1416
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It was called Tokusho Butai Jackaru, which would be Jackal.

1417
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Special Forces Unit Jackal, which was released in the US as Top Gunner.

1418
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Basically, the whole point of the game is you go through and you can run over...

1419
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Well, I like to run them over, but you can shoot down enemy soldiers wandering around.

1420
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And you rescue POWs and you have to actually take them to the extraction point where a helicopter will run off with them.

1421
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:03,000
And then you fight like whatever your boss is at the end of the level.

1422
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:11,000
But again, it came out over here in the arcade as Top Gunner, but it did come out as Jackal on the Nintendo.

1423
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Also though, for anyone who happened to be one of those few people who has a Famicom Disk System,

1424
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:32,000
it was brought out as Final Commando Akaiyousai, which basically is Final Command The Red Fortress.

1425
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:39,000
The game is just really fun. On top of that, when you play two player, it does force you to cooperate.

1426
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Because it gets to a point where if one person is going one way, it won't let your other person advance.

1427
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And sometimes one person can draw fire while the other person goes in and does something else.

1428
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It's really a unique one for the whole Run and Gun series.

1429
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You can actually blow up different areas in the game where there's hidden stuff.

1430
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You can get extra power-ups, you can get rocket launchers, or you can get...

1431
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I actually preferred to keep the grenades because the grenades would go over a wall, whereas rockets just sort of explode on the wall.

1432
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It was really cool.

1433
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I like how you pick up the little dudes. I didn't play this game a whole lot. I think I remember playing it once and I just wasn't that into it when I was younger.

1434
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:36,000
But I like how you pick up the little dudes in the houses and drop them off at the plane. It's like a rescue mission thing. It's cool.

1435
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:49,000
You can, though, keep upgrading your missiles to where you get your missile launcher, you get one with a higher range, you get one that produces shrapnel, and an area damage missile that shoots out from left and right.

1436
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I still preferred the grenades because they went over the walls.

1437
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You can also control which direction you fire in, which was pretty cool. You can turn and fire forward in a different way.

1438
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I mean, it's like a tank. So, it was really cool. It's one of my favorite ever games. On top of that, I actually have really good memories of the game, so it was kind of cool.

1439
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And also, there was a bootleg version of Top Gunner that would let you use the Ikari Warriors-style control. That was pretty cool.

1440
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:37,000
It had a version on the IBM PC in 1988, like I said, the Famicom Disk System, and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.

1441
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Or the inevitable Xbox Live Arcade port at some point, probably.

1442
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Could you imagine this Hi-Rez?

1443
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
That would be pretty awesome.

1444
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Sweet.

1445
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:55,000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Jackal, in this case on the NES, but on a variety of systems, as DarkSakura pointed out. Check it out.

1446
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
All right, and that's our cue to take a quick break, so that's exactly what we're going to do.

1447
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,000
We're going to take a break, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.

1448
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1449
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Tune to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
