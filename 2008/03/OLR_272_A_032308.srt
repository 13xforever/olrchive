[SPEAKER_02]: You and Dan always... With our big group of people.

8
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:08,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it seems that every year there's a new baby added with our friends who join us.

9
00:01:08,854 --> 00:01:10,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like one year they had Bob.

00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:13,236
[SPEAKER_02]: The next year they have Tatiana is her name.

11
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:14,457
[SPEAKER_02]: They call her Tater.

12
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:17,998
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a nice name for a child, Tater.

13
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:19,059
[SPEAKER_05]: She's cute.

14
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:19,759
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a cutie.

15
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:20,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't doubt it.

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Babies are cute.

[SPEAKER_05]: Happy day, Loki.

[SPEAKER_05]: Tech Master Loki also here every week.

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:22,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,461
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

27
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:24,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay.

28
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you do anything special today?

29
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:27,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the Easter Bunny leave you anything good?

30
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:31,467
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just went over to my mom's house and we barbecued ribs.

31
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Mmm, ribs.

32
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,610
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have interesting ways of spending Easter.

33
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:38,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, interesting good, not like interesting bad.

34
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:40,314
[SPEAKER_05]: But more food.

35
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:43,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Or as Frisbee in chat room says...

36
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:49,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrainer.com, the always present fourth guest on the show, Waffle Lounge Foodio.

37
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,192
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be the name of the show, Waffle Lounge Foodio.

38
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:55,415
[SPEAKER_02]: You could play the Waffle song from Mystery Science Theater.

39
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:57,094
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're not going to play the Waffle song right now.

40
00:02:57,114 --> 00:03:01,075
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into how was your gaming week, but first a teaser, a little teaser.

41
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:06,297
[SPEAKER_05]: We have big news to talk about, like big, like we just found out 30 minutes ago big.

42
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:08,257
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be talking about that in just a moment.

43
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:13,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people in chat are kind of going like WTF because they can hear us on Justin TV talking and like want to know what's up.

44
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:14,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, someone died.

45
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:15,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I killed them.

46
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:16,279
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no one died.

47
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:18,436
[SPEAKER_05]: The ferret died.

48
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:20,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Where has he been for the past year?

49
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I found the ferret the other day, and then I put him back in the dusty corner I found him in.

50
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:26,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you should have brought the ferret out.

51
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:29,788
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

52
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It was uneventful.

53
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:35,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.

54
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:36,055
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it?

55
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:37,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It was uneventful.

56
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:38,614
[SPEAKER_05]: No DSing?

57
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:39,414
[SPEAKER_05]: No Ragnarok?

58
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:39,875
[SPEAKER_05]: No nothing?

59
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:40,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I played Ragnarok.

60
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:41,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, of course!

61
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:42,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course!

62
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that goes without saying.

63
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:46,456
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually did not touch my DS all week.

64
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:47,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved that game.

65
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,497
[SPEAKER_02]: That game that Dan brought me home that I'm not going to play.

66
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,477
[SPEAKER_02]: The Professor whatever the fuck it is.

67
00:03:53,657 --> 00:03:54,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Professor Layton?

68
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:55,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

69
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,038
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've heard a lot of good things about that game.

70
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:58,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You might actually want to check it out at some point.

71
00:03:58,958 --> 00:03:59,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to play it.

72
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:01,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

73
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:04,515
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's House DarkSakura's House DarkSakura's House

74
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:32,154
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

75
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:51,362
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

76
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:20,142
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the ones that's been removed on there, so I'm going to slap that back on there.

77
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:24,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can fucking replace the thing, because I'm not touching it.

78
00:05:25,164 --> 00:05:25,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Bastards.

79
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:29,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I'm addressing this comment in chat, because some people may not know.

80
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:32,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike W. says, how many 360s does Loki have again?

81
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:33,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So please refresh us.

82
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,807
[SPEAKER_05]: How many 360s do you have?

83
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:35,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I have six.

84
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:36,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And why that many?

85
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we land them in a game room.

86
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:40,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got them for that.

87
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:41,629
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

88
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:43,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

89
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:51,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I had five originally, but then I bought one to replace another one, but I ended up fixing the original, so we have six.

90
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:52,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

91
00:05:53,648 --> 00:06:02,429
[SPEAKER_04]: One that hopefully will be fixed here pretty soon, because like I said, it's not three-ringed anymore, but I think it may have overheated so many times that it's damaged, but we'll see.

92
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this last one, which I'm sending to Microsoft, so that will be fixed.

93
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:11,911
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully it will all be fixed at one point.

94
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:19,437
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not very promising that three out of the six have died within the last three months.

95
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:21,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

96
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:21,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

97
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all I really got around to playing this week.

98
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:33,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a lot of stuff lined up for this week, including K Project, which is that res beta that got released out there.

99
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to try that because that looks cool.

100
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:37,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to dig out my Dreamcast for that.

101
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,291
[SPEAKER_04]: and then Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core.

102
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:43,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, I played a little bit of Smash Bros.

103
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:46,432
[SPEAKER_04]: this week, but just Space Emissary stuff.

104
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:51,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I added everybody in the goddamn friends code list, so stop your bitching.

105
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:52,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, seriously.

106
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:56,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody was online when I was online earlier, so you know what?

107
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:57,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop complaining.

108
00:06:57,854 --> 00:07:01,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about the Orange Lounge Radio forum thread, right?

109
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:01,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

110
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:02,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

111
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:02,775
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

112
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought, yeah, I added everyone.

113
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,311
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't add everyone, but I added most people.

114
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,133
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think I might have added everyone.

115
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:12,484
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

116
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:38,005
[SPEAKER_05]: and trying to unlock everything in the gallery.

117
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:43,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, play Five Brawls with Princess Peach to get Super Mario 2 and things like that.

118
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying to do as much of that stuff as I can.

119
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:48,368
[SPEAKER_05]: So, good times.

120
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And otherwise, I haven't been playing a whole lot.

121
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back to the Xbox 360 and just played some random old stuff.

122
00:07:54,971 --> 00:08:02,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing really of note was playing some World of Warcraft, but I was out of town this weekend and I was staying about a block from the Metreon.

123
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:04,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't even think to go there.

124
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not what it used to be.

125
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:10,782
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you were there next week, you could actually go to a Crisis Core launch party.

126
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:11,463
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

127
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:14,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, I do have to go back to San Francisco next week anyway.

128
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:17,147
[SPEAKER_05]: So, maybe I'll check it out.

129
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:18,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's like Tuesday.

130
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:19,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, never mind.

131
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:20,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going on a weekday.

132
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, interesting.

133
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:27,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so that does... Yeah, no new games to review this week.

134
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:28,515
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of odd.

135
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing Scrabulous on Facebook.

136
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:32,938
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like Scrabble.

137
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,279
[SPEAKER_04]: It just depends on your bandwidth.

138
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,700
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have dial-up, you might have a problem.

139
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you have dial-up, I don't think you're going to fucking be watching or downloading a movie.

140
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:09,364
[SPEAKER_04]: That would suck.

141
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:11,305
[SPEAKER_04]: One gigabyte file?

142
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:11,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

143
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:12,306
[SPEAKER_04]: No thanks.

144
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:15,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

145
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:15,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

146
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:18,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... Oh, I want to hear something funny, too.

147
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:25,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I have a friend at work right now who's really into rock band, and he keeps playing all the hard songs for me and unlocking me achievements.

148
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:26,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

149
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:29,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I can't fucking play the game on hard.

150
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:30,139
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I talking about?

151
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:31,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I can play guitar.

152
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:32,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't do drums.

153
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:34,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I played Rock Band this week.

154
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:36,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a lot of Rock Band this week, actually.

155
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,555
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you take it to parties.

156
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:44,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of that new, and I don't want to spoil the story that's coming up, but some of you guys know Rock Band had some enhancements this week, and we'll talk about them a little more a little later on.

157
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:47,458
[SPEAKER_05]: But I went on to check them out.

158
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:54,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't checked the Rock Band store in a long time, and I forgot that you can get some Nine Inch Nails songs that are pretty cool, and I got that.

159
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the B-52s have a song on there, so I had to get that.

160
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,382
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went shopping on Rock Band.

161
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,137
[SPEAKER_05]: because I heart microtransactions.

162
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:03,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I've spent way too much money.

163
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:05,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really, but yeah, I've spent way too much money.

164
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:07,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, way too much on Rock Band, seriously.

165
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:12,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But just think, the next party we have is going to be so bitchin' with Rock Band.

166
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need a Rock Band party.

167
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,161
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing though, they don't make it very easy because of that stupid digital rights management.

168
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:23,503
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, anything I download and if I bring it over here or whatever, I have to be logged in on live in order for all that content to be available.

169
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks.

170
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it really blows.

171
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft is crying in chat.

172
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,621
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, Mexico still can't access the music store and rock band.

173
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:31,662
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know what?

174
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:36,004
[SPEAKER_05]: In some ways, it's a good thing because then you just start spending money so stupidly because you're like, oh, I have points.

175
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:36,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I could just spend them.

176
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,585
[SPEAKER_01]: That sad face.

177
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:38,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

178
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:39,326
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

179
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:40,446
[SPEAKER_01]: That is sad face.

180
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,167
[SPEAKER_05]: That is sad face.

181
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:41,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Very sad face.

182
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:43,488
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you have it.

183
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:44,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

184
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:50,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So, let's get to the big news and it actually really sucks.

185
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:53,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's really no easy way for us to kind of mention this.

186
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:54,694
[SPEAKER_05]: This...

187
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:17,120
[SPEAKER_05]: and literally we just heard about some of the changes that have been going on with our streaming provider which is Live 365 literally about 30 minutes before our show went live tonight and the long and the short of it is that Live 365 is making some obscene changes in their pricing policies and they are going to be upping their

188
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:21,077
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be upping their rates to these obscene amounts.

189
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:28,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, right now, we pay about $60 a month to have about 100 live listeners.

190
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:37,225
[SPEAKER_05]: We would have to pay under this new plan $120 a month for 60 live listeners, which would only barely accommodate what we do on Sundays.

191
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:40,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, we don't talk about ratings.

192
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:45,008
[SPEAKER_05]: We get about 50 to 60 live people on a good Sunday night, and we've actually gone beyond that before.

193
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I think our highest show had 70 or 80 people.

194
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:50,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say we have, but I don't know.

195
00:11:51,673 --> 00:11:54,596
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sucks because it kind of came out of nowhere.

196
00:11:54,636 --> 00:11:56,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly, Live365 sent an email a month ago.

197
00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:57,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

198
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:59,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I never got it, so whatever.

199
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,964
[SPEAKER_05]: They're upping these rates, and even if we could afford it, we kind of don't want to.

200
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: We've made a decision that we will be leaving Live365 effective April 12th.

201
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:19,321
[SPEAKER_05]: and so that really sucks because that means the feed that we started in May of 2002 is going away.

202
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish this was an April Fool's joke, chat.

203
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:23,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

204
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:24,884
[SPEAKER_05]: This is completely legitimate.

205
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:29,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not an April Fool's joke like a preemptive strike or something because it's not even April yet.

206
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:32,728
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have no choice but to leave Life365.

207
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,619
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

208
00:12:58,114 --> 00:12:59,816
[SPEAKER_05]: We found out about this 30 minutes to an hour ago.

209
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:46,700
[SPEAKER_05]: so we're still trying to kind of scramble too but regardless our live feed will be closing effective April 12th meaning that those of you guys that listen at work to the lovely video game music that plays all day long and the retro lunch and all that it's going away and what I feel most horrible for are the other live folks that we've had bless our stream with their presence for their hard work in live shows over the years including

210
00:13:47,671 --> 00:14:05,628
[SPEAKER_05]: DMN, including Travis Donovan, of course, including, you know, Extifer back when he had his show, including the three of us that do our spinoff shows when we feel like it, and the things that we had planned that we wanted to do with the live feed that now we're, all those plans are effectively off, unfortunately.

211
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:33,832
[SPEAKER_05]: and obviously we'll do whatever we can for our friends that broadcast as well but we have to kind of like our number one priority right now is relocating our Sunday show first and then we'll see what we can do after that so Actdeft asks what's going to happen to DM Insanity and TDL I hope they keep going I hope they keep going somehow but unfortunately Orange Lounge Radio won't be around for them to do that with so

212
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:41,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio kind of ends in a way on April 12th because Orange Lounge Radio was the radio station.

213
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:47,704
[SPEAKER_05]: This show is actually Orange Lounge Radio Live, but obviously over the years it's just been Orange Lounge Radio.

214
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:50,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I don't know.

215
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:53,668
[SPEAKER_05]: The next week's going to be very interesting.

216
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the news.

217
00:14:55,982 --> 00:15:00,823
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have suggestions or offers, I guess, I don't know, send us an email.

218
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:07,065
[SPEAKER_05]: You can contact me in my personal email box, rob at orangelaunchrader.com or our general email bag, mailbag at orangelaunchrader.com.

219
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,146
[SPEAKER_05]: We think we know what we want to do.

220
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:13,587
[SPEAKER_05]: We think we know the option that makes the most sense to us, but it involves other people.

221
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:14,867
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to make sure they want to do it too.

222
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that.

223
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:19,649
[SPEAKER_05]: You got anything else you guys want to add?

224
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:20,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

225
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:20,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kind of been dying.

226
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:21,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

227
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:23,790
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like what's going on, you send your emails.

228
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say the life...

229
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:34,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, in turn, they hopefully will send emails to whomever is charging them, you know.

230
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:39,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I think that they probably know what's going to happen because they're raising all the rates on their stations.

231
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:43,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, a lot of people are just going to forego paying those rates and just quit.

232
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:43,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

233
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:48,031
[SPEAKER_04]: or find elsewhere, and that's unfortunately... I imagine we're not the only station that's doing this.

234
00:15:48,192 --> 00:16:01,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that they didn't have, you know, it wasn't really their choice to do that, but that's kind of, they have to... It does go back to the royalty things you've probably heard about from the past year, at least that's what they're blaming it on, but I still think it was kind of a bit out of left field.

235
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're taking advantage of that situation for their own personal gain.

236
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:07,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't help but feel there's a little of that going on.

237
00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:11,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you want to add, Jamie, as somebody who's been a live broadcaster for this long?

238
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:11,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

239
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:13,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

240
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that it hasn't already been said.

241
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it sucks.

242
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:17,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Wah, wah.

243
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:18,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make some refuse.

244
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:22,027
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

245
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:26,868
[SPEAKER_05]: RossDLUT says, Live365 is simply using the RAA boogeyman as an excuse to screw people.

246
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:32,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to knock them right now, but let me put it this way.

247
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:37,158
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the money to keep going if we wanted to.

248
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:40,721
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do the 60 listener limit, but we just kind of don't want to.

249
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:43,062
[SPEAKER_05]: We think we can do – this is more of an incentive.

250
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:47,266
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of shows us that like, hey, Orange Launch Radio, you guys have been kind of lazy the past six years.

251
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:52,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Just stay on on Life's Just Five because it was convenient and it was there, and you could just touch a button and everything is all set up.

252
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,753
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is really going to kind of force us to explore alternatives, and it could be exciting.

253
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:59,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be the beginning of big change, big change.

254
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,177
[SPEAKER_01]: When one door closes, another opens.

255
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:02,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely right.

256
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:02,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to –

257
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Check us out.

258
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,897
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also another option right here.

259
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:09,742
[SPEAKER_04]: They have actually people that do hosting for our unlimited listeners.

260
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:10,583
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

261
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:11,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

262
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:11,645
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

263
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:12,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, maybe.

264
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:13,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

265
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:15,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see over the next week.

266
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:17,614
[SPEAKER_05]: We're exploring lots and lots of ideas.

267
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:19,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that.

268
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:21,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously our number one priority is keeping this show going.

269
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:27,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that many people's worlds will be crushed without a 24-7 music feed.

270
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:30,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize to those that have been listening to our 24-7 music feed.

271
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:35,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there are some that do, but obviously Sunday shows the priority for us right now.

272
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

273
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,307
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

274
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,059
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

275
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,512
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into other housekeeping tonight.

276
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:08,697
[SPEAKER_05]: The other housekeeping tonight, of course, a happy Easter or whatever it is you celebrate today.

277
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,760
[SPEAKER_05]: If nothing at all, then happy Sunday to you.

278
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,566
[SPEAKER_05]: To all of our Orange Lounge Radio listeners, yes, we are here live on Easter because everybody, I guess, did their stuff this morning.

279
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:20,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the Bay Area this weekend, had a very lovely weekend in San Francisco.

280
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:20,830
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good.

281
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

282
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:40,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

283
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:33,259
[SPEAKER_05]: and the thing is that they do Rocky Horror Picture Show and I've been involved with that for a long time you know the show I did before Orange Lounge Radio actually started because of Travis and I's mutual love of Rocky Horror Picture Show under Station Live I still am involved with that not as heavily as I used to be but I still respect the scene and the counterculture that it provides this is very rare to have this show on the big screen this is probably the only time this year outside of a convention this will show on the big screen anywhere

284
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Gary Shale, Oscar Drill, Live at the Show

285
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:54,609
[SPEAKER_04]: The Orange Lounge Radio Wiki

286
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:25,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, I showed you that before the show.

287
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:26,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that awesome, the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki?

288
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:28,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it, but you're missing some jokes.

289
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:31,679
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to go old school.

290
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:35,782
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, like, you know, death cake.

291
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:44,028
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of old school jokes, but I've got to say, I'm very impressed with the work that the folks that have been working on the Wiki have done.

292
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:49,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the place that the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki is at, orangeloungeradio.wikia.com.

293
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:56,401
[SPEAKER_05]: and just to give you an idea what's there, and this is all the listeners that have been doing this.

294
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:56,982
[SPEAKER_05]: This is incredible.

295
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:04,212
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a page of like inside jokes from the show that includes like the Loki is tingle bet and just some of the other things that have come up on the show.

296
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:05,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's been...

297
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:09,776
[SPEAKER_05]: They can hear the plane over the live feed right?

298
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:10,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Can they hear that on the podcast?

299
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:11,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they hearing that on Justin.TV?

300
00:21:12,258 --> 00:21:14,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably Justin.TV because the mic's right by the window.

301
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:15,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, because the window's open.

302
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they probably can hear the plane outside.

303
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:20,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yes, we live by an Air Force base.

304
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:21,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not actually.

305
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:22,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a helicopter.

306
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:24,027
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an Air Force base.

307
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:25,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be an Air Force base.

308
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:25,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it CHP?

309
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:27,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, somebody's breaking the law.

310
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,170
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't live that far.

311
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

312
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it now like a business airport is what they use it for primarily?

313
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:32,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a commercial airport.

314
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:32,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Like FedEx and air shows.

315
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:33,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and air shows.

316
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:34,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, the air shows.

317
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:35,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

318
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:40,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the Blue Angels kind of get old to me after the first couple times and they're so loud.

319
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:44,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to go see the Blue Angels when I was a kid, okay?

320
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,980
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how fucking old they are.

321
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:47,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, really.

322
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:54,944
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we've always lived by the airport, but now it's just tonight the window's open because it's hot here now, so we have the fan on in the window.

323
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's bad now.

324
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:59,446
[SPEAKER_04]: It only gets to like 110 outside.

325
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,987
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I found out the information for you in an air conditioner.

326
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:04,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, excellent.

327
00:22:04,508 --> 00:22:05,628
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that later.

328
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:06,495
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

329
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:35,663
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week

330
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:00,616
[SPEAKER_05]: BD Live

331
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:36,241
[SPEAKER_04]: and it will allow you to do different things with your movies including they will have additional downloadable interactive content as well as like interactive games with leaderboards and that kind of stuff.

332
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:41,644
[SPEAKER_04]: All stuff that you can kind of throw together on a Blu-ray disc which is pretty cool.

333
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:49,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Other cool stuff that they're enhancing, you'll be able to play DivX in Windows Media files larger than 2 GB.

334
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the music and photo playlist can be exported from the PS3 to the PSP.

335
00:23:57,134 --> 00:24:00,937
[SPEAKER_04]: DVDs and Blu-rays will resume playback for the moment you last stopped them.

336
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:06,301
[SPEAKER_04]: The PSP can be used as a remote control to play music on the PS3.

337
00:24:07,222 --> 00:24:14,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And the web browser will feature a faster page loading times and the ability to save links and stream linked videos.

338
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:16,348
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

339
00:24:16,937 --> 00:24:24,459
[SPEAKER_04]: and also I guess another thing they called Mosquito Noise Reduction will be added to AV Control Panel for Blu-rays and DVDs.

340
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the fuck that last part is, but I'm sure someone out there does.

341
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:32,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what that means either.

342
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:33,822
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that called?

343
00:24:33,862 --> 00:24:34,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Mosquito?

344
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:35,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Mosquito Noise Reduction.

345
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:40,444
[SPEAKER_05]: My guess may be like... Is that to like filter out the planes that fly by while you're watching the movies?

346
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:41,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that one.

347
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:44,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like line humming or something like that.

348
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It removes the hum off the line.

349
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:46,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

350
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:48,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought Blu-ray was supposed to be perfect anyway.

351
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:50,646
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is there doing line noise?

352
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:55,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Blu-ray may be perfect, but your theater setup may not be perfect.

353
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:56,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, I see.

354
00:24:56,132 --> 00:24:56,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

355
00:24:57,254 --> 00:24:57,514
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

356
00:24:58,783 --> 00:25:01,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And my god, that sun is so fucking bright.

357
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:01,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

358
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:02,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Through that window.

359
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like blinded by that.

360
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure the Justin TV people that are watching us on there can see.

361
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:11,985
[SPEAKER_05]: But as we're taping, you know, just the way the sun is.

362
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:12,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just fine.

363
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:17,166
[SPEAKER_05]: The sun is shining like right on Loki and I during the entirety of tonight's show.

364
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:18,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hiding in shadows.

365
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:19,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we know, DarkSakura.

366
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:20,267
[SPEAKER_05]: We know.

367
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,047
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

368
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:23,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just like duct tape a towel up there?

369
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:24,648
That's cool.

370
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:26,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's just re-situating.

371
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:27,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm moving the sun.

372
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:31,396
[SPEAKER_05]: See, what'll be funny is that then later the sun will move slowly and hit you in the eyes again.

373
00:25:32,317 --> 00:25:33,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it going that way?

374
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like last week, it kind of went down.

375
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,923
[SPEAKER_05]: It's shining through the last window right now.

376
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Constant exposure to your eyes will eventually give me a headache.

377
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:41,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

378
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:42,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm already starting to get one.

379
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:44,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's why I had a headache earlier.

380
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:44,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

381
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:45,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Stories!

382
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:46,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway, sorry.

383
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:48,922
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP 3.93 Internet Radio Feature

384
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:08,027
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's really it.

385
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:14,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I imagine it probably closed some loopholes in the hacking world but my other question would be has this already been hacked, Loki?

386
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:26,175
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it hasn't because really all it did was add just those 20 stations so they have a workaround to add those 20 stations if you want but otherwise they're not worrying about cracking it because it's basically just that.

387
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:35,099
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems a little silly to do a whole firmware upgrade just to add those better be 20 damn good stations 20 damn good stations better be in there

388
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:40,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, does 3 Speech have their own radio station?

389
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:50,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure No, I think all games where we're syndicated on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings I think they're on there So that's all you really need, right?

390
00:26:51,265 --> 00:26:56,067
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not on there because Live 365 doesn't go on Shoutcast So we've been paying all that money, why?

391
00:26:57,167 --> 00:27:04,909
[SPEAKER_05]: When we can't even get listed on PSPs Oh, forget it It's old hat now Things are going to be changing soon I have two words for that

392
00:27:05,715 --> 00:27:09,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Canogram says it's not stations, it's players.

393
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:12,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I'm what, like different skins and stuff?

394
00:27:14,043 --> 00:27:14,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's even lamer.

395
00:27:17,265 --> 00:27:18,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony, play us.

396
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:21,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosteel UT says OLR should be on three-speech radio.

397
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:22,870
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

398
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:26,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we could talk about all the great things in the Sony world and nothing else.

399
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:29,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about all the good things in the Sony world.

400
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:30,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And our show would be only five minutes long.

401
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I have some great things in the Sony world to talk about.

402
00:27:34,126 --> 00:27:35,566
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, then please do share.

403
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:38,127
[SPEAKER_02]: More like Sony being fucking stupid.

404
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:39,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha.

405
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:39,988
[SPEAKER_02]: No, um.

406
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:59,604
[SPEAKER_02]: basically EA put out a patch for the orange box on PS3 that's supposed to address these problems with connectivity and frame rate issues and slow loading times but they haven't put out any other documentation to really say what else it's supposed to do and the thing is like 128 meg so it's kind of big and

407
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,321
[SPEAKER_02]: No one else really knows what else it does.

408
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:10,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole thing is, it's not really Valve that did it, it's from their third party, so, whatever.

409
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:21,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least it's not like, um, I was gonna say, like, Bully got patched recently, and apparently the patch didn't do anything.

410
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:25,470
[SPEAKER_02]: See, see, see, Valve, this is what you get for having software on PlayStation 3.

411
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, RustyLUT in chat says the patch does nothing.

412
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:33,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they said what the patch did, it's just, um, I don't know.

413
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:33,976
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to do.

414
00:28:34,637 --> 00:28:46,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I am looking that up right now, because I don't remember off the top of my head, because I don't own the PS3 version of the Orange Box, and you know me, I don't care about anybody but myself, so, I don't know.

415
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:55,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't have the PS3 version either, I have the Xbox 360 version, and keep in mind, the only version worth having is either PC or Xbox 360.

416
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:59,425
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 is, it's not meant to be online.

417
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

418
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:54,764
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know if they're going to actually scale it back resolution wise I mean after all they did allow them to break the barrier for Street Fighter 2 HD Turbo Remix whatever the fuck it's called now I think that that was the last announced thing though that they were having to scale it back because the game wasn't quite working at the full resolution I'm sure Microsoft will let them bend the rules a little bit to make it work with a big game like that okay

419
00:29:55,598 --> 00:29:59,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, since we've wasted enough time, now I can tell you what was in that patch.

420
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:08,466
[SPEAKER_04]: They fixed graphical issues where a player would have the explosion effect left on the end of their rocket launcher while attempting to rocket jump.

421
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Some memory leaks fixed.

422
00:30:11,187 --> 00:30:15,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Fixed an issue where the player's name would not appear on the stats comparison screen.

423
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:21,994
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an issue that would cause the vote tallies to disappear when you viewed a scoreboard between rounds.

424
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:23,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Online server issue.

425
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

426
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,303
[SPEAKER_04]: An issue with players not always being added to the player's menu across MediaBar.

427
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:39,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Fixed a bug where a player viewing a friend without an EA account would have an empty entry in their friend's leaderboard.

428
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:46,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And fixed an issue where it was not possible to connect to EA's servers if you have more than 30 friends.

429
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:55,182
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like they fixed a lot of issues, but nothing really important like frame rate issues or anything that really needed to be fixed.

430
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh, unfortunate.

431
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:00,572
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, speaking of Valve, you know what I checked out?

432
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, after all this time, and I know some of you guys are going to be like, oh my god, Rob, you're behind the times.

433
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:08,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally downloaded and checked out Steam this week.

434
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:10,278
[SPEAKER_05]: After all this time.

435
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:12,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice little front-end program.

436
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,743
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of reminds me of X-Fire, but like with game purchases available inside it.

437
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:21,086
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually thought about getting Portal, just so I can have it on the computer.

438
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:25,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm a sucker for that game, as a lot of people are, what can I say?

439
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

440
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:28,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Persona 4 Persona 4

441
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,510
[SPEAKER_04]: All sorts of stuff from the new game.

442
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Persona 4 is coming to Japan in July.

443
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:57,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting enough, it's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 and not the PS3.

444
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:00,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's pretty cool.

445
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:04,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks, you know, to me, I think it looks 100 times better than Persona 3.

446
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:08,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm sure a lot of people will be very happy about that.

447
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:14,206
[SPEAKER_04]: No word of what's coming over to the US, but seeing as they've brought over Persona 3 and Persona 3 FES...

448
00:32:16,465 --> 00:32:17,466
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

449
00:32:47,657 --> 00:32:53,463
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pretty interesting that they're packing all that in a PlayStation 2 game, you know what I mean?

450
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:58,228
[SPEAKER_05]: That they're still cranking them out for the quote-unquote old system.

451
00:32:58,348 --> 00:33:01,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I guess there's still tons and tons of PS2s out there.

452
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:04,574
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still one of the better-selling game systems, eh?

453
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:05,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

454
00:33:05,635 --> 00:33:06,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

455
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:07,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it makes sense.

456
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:09,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

457
00:33:31,187 --> 00:33:33,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It has some more in common with Street Fighter 2.

458
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:39,849
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is starting to sound more and more like just another Street Fighter 2 port, but just like completely new graphics and everything.

459
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:40,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

460
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:43,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.

461
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:51,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but yet, you know, it's got the whole, it's 3D-ish element and, you know, the whole new characters and all that.

462
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:56,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the fighter guy and the, what was her name?

463
00:33:56,573 --> 00:33:57,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Crimson...

464
00:33:58,215 --> 00:33:59,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Viper, whatever her name was.

465
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:01,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be very cool.

466
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:14,526
[SPEAKER_05]: But the news that was announced this week is that not only are there some small cosmetic changes in the game, but that the old combos will work exactly the same way in the new game.

467
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:16,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means the old combos from Street Fighter 2.

468
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:26,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you got a Guile combo down that you used to use in Street Fighter 2, apparently you can use them in Street Fighter 4 as well.

469
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:30,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Killer Instinct.

470
00:34:55,069 --> 00:35:00,313
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just... Have you ever played against, though, one of those people who are just like the combo people?

471
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:01,794
[SPEAKER_02]: It's painful.

472
00:35:01,954 --> 00:35:07,838
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, strangely enough, not so much in Street Fighter II, but in Mortal Kombat, I used to get those people all the time, and it used to piss me off.

473
00:35:08,218 --> 00:35:13,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of those people on the beta version, though, just because I learned Kitana's infinite combo.

474
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:16,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was funny, because people get mad.

475
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:16,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway...

476
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:19,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of pain... I gotta say this real quick in chat.

477
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob D says, uh, there's no way they could get away with skipping those combos.

478
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:23,682
[SPEAKER_05]: This is nothing new.

479
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,203
[SPEAKER_05]: They never change mechanics that much.

480
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:29,267
[SPEAKER_05]: True, but when you consider the age of Street Fighter 2, you know what I mean?

481
00:35:30,347 --> 00:35:31,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kinda, kinda cool.

482
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:32,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get on with the pain?

483
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,170
[SPEAKER_05]: You may.

484
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:33,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring on the pain.

485
00:35:35,172 --> 00:35:43,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, pain is gonna be on PlayStation Network, um, at least for, uh, the PAL PSN, um, for, uh, 499 pounds.

486
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:43,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

487
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:49,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's a game where you throw stuff for points.

488
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really describe it much else than that.

489
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:53,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you buy Pain?

490
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:54,621
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

491
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:55,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you did.

492
00:35:55,982 --> 00:35:57,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not bought anything.

493
00:35:57,162 --> 00:36:02,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, other than Flow, I bought that on there.

494
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:08,686
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, I have not bought a game on the PSN because I do not like their payment method.

495
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:10,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like jackass in the game.

496
00:36:10,227 --> 00:36:11,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like using real money.

497
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:12,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I like points.

498
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:12,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Jamie.

499
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:23,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the whole point of pain is that, you know, you're causing misfortune in people, and people grow up and laugh at them.

500
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:24,617
[SPEAKER_02]: They get laughed at.

501
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:27,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, that's sort of what pain is about.

502
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:42,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, to get back to the story, there are also additional packs that are 69 pence each, and it will be the Scurvdog Muffy pack.

503
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:47,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa, Hung Lo, Ginger, Cookie, and Fun With Explosives packs.

504
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:49,545
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one is supposed to be a freebie.

505
00:36:50,246 --> 00:36:55,469
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but any game that combines Santa and Fun With Explosives you think would be instant win.

506
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:58,291
[SPEAKER_02]: If they had a band, it would be named Fun With Explosives.

507
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:03,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

508
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:08,897
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, the store also has the Stranglehold pack for $9.99. $9.99.

509
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:12,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, again, in pounds.

510
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:15,538
[SPEAKER_02]: That has multiplayer maps.

511
00:37:15,598 --> 00:37:17,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually should be the one they got on Xbox Live.

512
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,579
[SPEAKER_05]: You should see if that name is taken in Rock Band.

513
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun with explosives.

514
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if not, then I would be stealing the one from Clerks that Dan came up with this morning.

515
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:29,402
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

516
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:30,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Making Fuck.

517
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:33,024
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably taken.

518
00:37:33,764 --> 00:37:34,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't doubt it.

519
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:38,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have the name Emergency Kittens, but there's no one in the band.

520
00:37:38,746 --> 00:37:39,946
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

521
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:47,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on to some release dates for other things coming out around the world in the regular stores, the big box stores.

522
00:37:48,373 --> 00:37:51,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this week we've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

523
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:57,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, winding down a little bit until we get to Mario Kart and Grand Theft Auto.

524
00:37:58,055 --> 00:38:02,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sector on PS3 and Xbox 360 Viking Battle for Asgard on PS3 and Xbox 360 Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core on PSP

[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what number release this is this year, but one of the billion releases for Harvest Moon this year with Harvest Moon DS Cute.

[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, that'll be fun too.

534
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:36,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Ninja Gaiden still have the epic cinema scenes like the old school games have?

535
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:36,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

536
00:39:37,172 --> 00:39:38,472
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hope so, on the DS.

537
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:44,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the DS, but the whole game is controlled with the stylus, so that's pretty cool.

538
00:39:45,475 --> 00:39:46,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see here.

539
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:51,498
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also got just some more crap here.

540
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:56,147

553
00:41:19,091 --> 00:41:22,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a spoiler for Japan, Nitro Bike sucks.

554
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:23,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do you know that?

555
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:26,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I played it and it sucks.

556
00:41:26,886 --> 00:41:27,746
[SPEAKER_05]: What Sucks About It

557
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:58,600
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68, by the way, refers to one of the earlier titles we mentioned in chat.

558
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,821
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, Golden Kump Ass.

559
00:42:02,242 --> 00:42:02,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

560
00:42:03,182 --> 00:42:04,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Golden Kump Ass.

00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:20,010
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 2 sees Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus comes out, as well as Neo Angelique Full Voice in a premium box and a super premium box, as well as the original.

562
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:29,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill Origins makes its way to some Asian regions this week, but Korea is the only one we see mentioned, so be sure to check.

563
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:31,995
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be a little bit longer before it makes its way to Japan.

564
00:42:33,036 --> 00:42:38,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobunaga no Yabu Online comes out in Japan this week as well.

565
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of fun stuff.

566
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:43,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see real quickly what's coming out on the handheld systems.

567

[SPEAKER_05]: On the Nintendo DS, we have Business Ryoku Kente DS comes out.

[SPEAKER_05]: Baseball game.

571
00:43:00,336 --> 00:43:03,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that it says Hitman Reborn in it, in the middle of it, though.

572
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:08,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of makes me think of a different type of game.

573
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:09,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's baseball with Hitman.

574
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:10,103
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

575
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:10,523
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

576
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:12,869
[SPEAKER_05]: They need Battlefield Baseball.

577
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:13,830
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be pretty awesome.

578
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:14,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

[SPEAKER_05]: PSP.

586
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:39,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Check in real quick to see if anything's coming out of note there.

587
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G. That might be kind of cool.

588
00:43:44,162 --> 00:43:47,763
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as Tomb Raider Anniversary comes out on the Sony PSP.

589
00:43:47,823 --> 00:43:48,604
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Japan.

00:43:50,524 --> 00:43:51,125
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

591
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:56,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well I have for our UK listeners another set of release dates.

592
00:43:57,412 --> 00:43:59,833
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 27th, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

593
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:03,395
[SPEAKER_02]: You've heard us talk about this, so don't worry about it.

594
00:44:04,435 --> 00:44:05,916
[SPEAKER_02]: The Golden Horde on PC.

595
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:23,204
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 28th, we have Coded Arms Contagion, Football Manager 2008, God of War, Chains of Olympus, King of Clubs, Naruto, Clash of Ninja Revolution, Powershot Pinball Constructor, which sounds pretty fun, that's on DS.

00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:43,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

598
00:44:44,097 --> 00:44:44,897
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be it.

599
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:49,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out here not very soon, but soon enough.

600
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:55,999
[SPEAKER_04]: In June, Activision actually announced that they will be bringing Guitar Hero on tour to the Nintendo DS.

601
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you may be wondering, how the hell are they going to do that?

602
00:44:59,142 --> 00:45:03,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's actually a brand new peripheral that they're releasing along with it called the Guitar Grip.

603
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:08,612
[SPEAKER_04]: It has four fret buttons and a wonderful little hand strap to put your hand through.

604
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So you use that just like you would, you know, the fret buttons on an actual guitar.

605
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:21,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you strum on the touch screen with a stylus, or actually a pick stylus that comes with the game to do that kind of stuff.

606
00:45:22,322 --> 00:45:24,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you know, plays just like Guitar Hero.

607
00:45:25,303 --> 00:45:29,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to have 20 songs, or more than 20 songs in the game.

608
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:32,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And 80% of the songs will be original master recordings.

609
00:45:33,285 --> 00:45:34,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

610
00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:34,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I've

611
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:39,552
[SPEAKER_04]: My memory serves me right, it's $49.99, comes out June 22nd.

612
00:45:40,453 --> 00:45:42,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just in time for my birthday!

613
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:46,477
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, they've wasted no time in whoring this game to the masses.

614
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:53,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you guys ever visit Yahoo.com, like just, you know, out of the blue, but it's one of the pages I'll go to, you know, for like news and search and stuff.

615
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:56,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a little flash ad that pops right up there.

616
00:45:56,905 --> 00:45:59,027
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already whoring the Guitar Hero on tour.

617
00:45:59,067 --> 00:45:59,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

618
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:00,628
[SPEAKER_04]: They are wasting no time.

619
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:12,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would recommend pre-ordering this if you're really interested in it because like most other Activision games that include peripherals, especially brand new peripherals that they're breaking ground on, this thing will be hard to find.

620
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:16,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee asks, is anyone honestly going to buy this crap?

621
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have mine pre-ordered already.

622
00:46:19,396 --> 00:46:23,340
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not going to probably play it because that's what I do.

623
00:46:24,702 --> 00:46:25,903
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks interesting.

624
00:46:26,023 --> 00:46:27,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested enough where I at least want to play it.

625
00:46:28,005 --> 00:46:29,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I want to drop, what you said, $49.95?

626
00:46:29,807 --> 00:46:29,527
$49.99.

627
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:34,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I want to drop $50 on it, especially if it's only 20 songs.

628
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,294
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm interested in checking it out.

629
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

630
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's neat.

631
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:45,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it would be that difficult if it's only four buttons if I can already play five-button mode on the... Dude, Konami really missed out, man.

632
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:47,357
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have done Guitar Freeze with three buttons.

633
00:46:47,377 --> 00:46:48,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying that for a long time.

634
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:49,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

635
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:50,820
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

636
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm interested.

637
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:52,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm interested.

638
00:46:53,022 --> 00:46:53,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask chat.

639
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:57,965
[SPEAKER_05]: How many folks in chat are interested in picking this game up?

640
00:46:58,226 --> 00:46:59,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero on tour.

641
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:05,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick poll of chat because I imagine most of you that own DSs or if you don't own a DS, imagine you did.

642
00:47:05,371 --> 00:47:06,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you pick up this game?

643
00:47:08,522 --> 00:47:11,123
[SPEAKER_05]: and Frisbee says, please just smack yourself.

644
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Elite Beat Agents.

645
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:13,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks.

646
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I feel so sorry for Elite Beat Agents.

647
00:47:16,786 --> 00:47:19,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Fry's the other day and that game's like on clearance.

648
00:47:19,528 --> 00:47:19,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

649
00:47:19,808 --> 00:47:20,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Tons and tons of copies.

650
00:47:20,648 --> 00:47:21,529
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't buy it anymore, actually.

651
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:22,149
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of sad.

652
00:47:22,169 --> 00:47:22,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so sad.

653
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:23,990
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is awesome.

654
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:33,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, hey, here's the thing, and I don't know if you should start getting worried about this or not, but they're really whoring Guitar Hero out.

655
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:44,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Activision, I don't know if they're going to drive it into the ground or what, but, I mean, we've got, actually, literally a week after this, Guitar Hero Aerosmith coming out.

656
00:47:45,265 --> 00:47:52,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you've got Guitar Hero 4, and who knows how many other shit, you know, games that they're going to throw in the middle there.

657
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:57,069
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really whoring that franchise out, and people are kind of really buying into it, unfortunately.

658
00:47:57,229 --> 00:47:59,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's look at our instant poll results in chatroom.

659
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:03,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to read the nicknames because that will take me too long, but really quickly, here's some of the comments.

660
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:07,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Question was, are you going to buy Guitar Hero on Tour DS?

661
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:08,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.

662
00:48:09,438 --> 00:48:08,418
0%.

663
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:09,979
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

664
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:10,940
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

665
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:11,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Not me.

666
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Just get a PSP and DJ Max.

667
00:48:15,523 --> 00:48:16,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends on the song list.

668
00:48:17,165 --> 00:48:17,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

669
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:17,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

670
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:21,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Only for the peripheral to make it easier to play Puzzle League.

671
00:48:22,516 --> 00:48:23,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Strap for the win.

672
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:27,840
[SPEAKER_05]: If the game has songs I like, I might download, I mean pick it up.

673
00:48:29,922 --> 00:48:33,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I may get it if they guarantee cheap expansion pack song cards minus peripheral.

674
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Never, ever, ever, ever.

675
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:42,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I will purchase Guitar Hero on tour after I'm done burning $100 bills.

676
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,034
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nope, you'd look like a damn fool playing it.

677
00:48:46,415 --> 00:48:48,196
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, not ripped off.

678
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:49,808
[SPEAKER_05]: and Khan.

679
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:53,734
[SPEAKER_05]: There's your instant poll results.

680
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:59,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was just thinking, I mean, this is a good game for kids, you know, especially when you're taking them on the road and stuff.

681
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:01,086
[SPEAKER_04]: They can play their Guitar Hero.

682
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:02,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

683
00:49:20,456 --> 00:49:22,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, you can play Guitar Hero in the car.

684
00:49:22,497 --> 00:49:23,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun.

685
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:23,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

686
00:49:23,777 --> 00:49:26,198
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason I'm buying it is so we can show it on the show.

687
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:27,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much the only reason.

688
00:49:27,919 --> 00:49:28,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, don't waste your money.

689
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:33,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, just because I ordered it doesn't mean I'm going to actually buy it, okay?

690
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't have to.

691
00:49:35,581 --> 00:49:38,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I just put it on order to kind of hold my spot.

692
00:49:40,703 --> 00:49:43,404
[SPEAKER_05]: RossDLUT says, Loki, you're high.

693
00:49:43,484 --> 00:49:46,825
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll bug mommy even more with this game by singing along.

694
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,946
[SPEAKER_04]: No, maybe my wife would do that, but, you know.

695
00:49:53,187 --> 00:49:55,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't put songs with words in them.

696
00:49:55,349 --> 00:49:55,789
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

697
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:56,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

698
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:02,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go into more lawsuit news from Gibson.

699
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:08,018
[SPEAKER_05]: We already kind of talked about this last week, but if you can believe it, even more lawsuits coming out from Gibson.

700
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:17,205
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember Gibson sued Activision, they sued Harmonix last week, all over the fact that Gibson says they have had a patent for electronic guitars for...

701
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:33,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And get this, this week, now they've sued GameStop, Walmart, Target, Kmart, Amazon, Toys R Us All these major retailers that sell Guitar Hero games Seeking basically to stop the sale of the games Did you see they also sued EA?

702
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:46,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though EA doesn't make Guitar Hero at all It's crazy, yeah I was going to say in the next piece here They sued Harmonix, Viacom, and EA now as well

703
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:51,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I guess they want to sue as many people as possible.

704
00:50:52,985 --> 00:50:53,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand this.

705
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:54,986
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes no sense at all.

706
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:55,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

707
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:57,128
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking for money.

708
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:01,832
[SPEAKER_05]: But why would you sue the retailers to get them to try to stop selling the game?

709
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:04,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're trying to make a big stink.

710
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:06,155
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to file an injunction.

711
00:51:06,175 --> 00:51:09,077
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to make a big stink and seeing who will give them money.

712
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki says the EA suit is over Rock Band.

713
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's over Rock Band because they mentioned Guitar Hero in the lawsuit.

714
00:51:18,844 --> 00:51:19,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Rock Band.

715
00:51:20,886 --> 00:51:24,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it because now Harmonix is a part of... Oh no, I guess it was just an agreement.

716
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:25,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

717
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:26,330
[SPEAKER_05]: That just sucked.

718
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:27,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's sue everything.

719
00:51:28,071 --> 00:51:29,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that comment from Gerardimo in chat.

720
00:51:29,893 --> 00:51:33,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you gotta wonder, is this Gibson thing legitimate or not?

721
00:51:33,936 --> 00:51:35,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's actually an analyst out there.

722
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:37,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we love analysts.

723
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:41,101
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is actually a legal analyst working for...

724
00:51:42,509 --> 00:51:52,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Wedbush Morgan, he's an analyst, he says this about the lawsuits, quote, this is, Michael Pastors' name, quote, this is a poorly masked attempt to extort money.

725
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:56,714
[SPEAKER_05]: They are using any way they can to have Activision write them a check.

726
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:04,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, this is the third game, I mean, well, the third major release of the game that's been out so far.

727
00:52:05,058 --> 00:52:10,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I think at one time they had Gibson guitars in the game, I want to say, I don't know, I may be wrong.

728
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

729
00:52:11,752 --> 00:52:12,752
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

730
00:52:36,337 --> 00:52:45,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Konami, and if I remember correctly, I thought Activision was licensing the rights to use that from Konami, and not Gibson.

731
00:52:49,772 --> 00:52:53,856
[SPEAKER_04]: All I gotta say is the next fucking guitar games you guys put out, just forget about Gibson.

732
00:52:53,896 --> 00:52:57,380
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plenty of other guitar manufacturers out there you can license guitars for.

733
00:53:03,137 --> 00:53:09,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyhow, this news, I know, makes me angsty every time I hear about this, and I'm sure you guys feel the same way.

734
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

735
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:20,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

736
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:47,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess life 365 goes without saying, so I'm not gonna really go too much in depth on that, um, but F you to, um, having way too many people in the house when I had a doffy to work on.

737
00:53:48,014 --> 00:53:51,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly got her blushed and I haven't finished with the rest of her face.

738
00:53:54,655 --> 00:53:57,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, F you to, um,

739
00:53:57,759 --> 00:53:58,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

740
00:53:58,159 --> 00:53:58,700
[SPEAKER_04]: That fucking sucks.

741
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:22,567
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to Live365, goes without saying.

742
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:32,413
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I think when this show comes back in a non-Live365 place, we should actually probably rename this segment to the Live365 Memorial FUs of the Week.

743
00:54:34,514 --> 00:54:35,215
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be fun.

744
00:54:36,155 --> 00:54:39,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but also I want to give an FU to the cat scan I had on Thursday.

745
00:54:39,978 --> 00:54:40,878
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so miserable.

746
00:54:40,898 --> 00:54:46,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, I still have a bruise from where they gave me the little shot thingy, or the iodine thing, bleh.

747
00:54:47,697 --> 00:54:48,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate, oh, it was so miserable.

748
00:54:49,138 --> 00:54:50,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So miserable, I reacted so bad to it.

749
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:55,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I had to have a CAT scan because I'm still having those pains that I've been having.

750
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:57,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not going away, which sucks.

751
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't get the results back till Monday, so F you to waiting.

752
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:02,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It does sucks.

753
00:55:03,726 --> 00:55:05,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, though, this is the best diet I've ever been on.

754
00:55:05,787 --> 00:55:08,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll eat, like, a couple things and I get extremely full.

755
00:55:08,689 --> 00:55:11,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I had gastric bypass or something without having to pay for it.

756
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:12,311
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

757
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week.

758
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back to some gaming news.

759
00:55:18,562 --> 00:55:23,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And, wow, we have almost like a whole segment of music game news, don't we, Jamie?

760
00:55:24,384 --> 00:55:25,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, how's that?

761
00:55:25,384 --> 00:55:28,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, you know, before they're screwing us over.

762
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:39,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, MTV has said that they've sold, what was it, more than 6 million, I think, songs and rock band as downloadable content.

763
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:46,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So now Harmonix is bringing in the Rock Band Music Store for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

764
00:55:47,588 --> 00:55:54,651
[SPEAKER_02]: so that you can actually download your songs in-game without leaving the game.

765
00:55:55,351 --> 00:56:04,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can sort them by artist, genre, album, title, pack, and other ways, too.

766
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:05,175
[SPEAKER_02]: There's album art.

767
00:56:05,955 --> 00:56:09,897
[SPEAKER_02]: You can listen to song previews and difficulty levels.

768
00:56:11,157 --> 00:56:13,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And the patch is actually supposed to be out this week.

769
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:15,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it's already out.

770
00:56:17,418 --> 00:56:23,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the patch had already... Didn't you say that you... I did, and it's lots of fun.

771
00:56:23,309 --> 00:56:25,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just... He's eating toast.

772
00:56:25,634 --> 00:56:25,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

773
00:56:26,476 --> 00:56:29,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I give that F you to not being able to eat, and then I'm eating.

774
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, sorry.

775
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:39,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I did download the music store, and it's actually kind of cool because you get the little album art, and you can download the song previews now.

776
00:56:39,706 --> 00:56:46,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, if you're not sure exactly what a song is, like, I think I've heard that song, but I'm not sure, you can download the little song previews, and it stays on there.

777
00:56:46,831 --> 00:56:50,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're scrolling in the list in the future, you can kind of hear it like it was DDR or something.

778
00:56:51,923 --> 00:56:55,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the music store kind of looks like a DDR selection screen to me, I don't know.

779
00:56:56,144 --> 00:57:08,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the fact that you can actually preview the songs, you know, something that I thought should have been on there in the first place, instead of having to buy these songs blindly, unless you have, like, a YouTube link where you can watch the video or listen to the song.

780
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:10,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's smart.

781
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:17,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the whole thing was smart because I realized there were songs in there I didn't, like, I wanted that I didn't realize I didn't have.

782
00:57:17,352 --> 00:57:23,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because it's hard sometimes, especially when you recognize a song on the radio by the song, not necessarily by the title.

783
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:26,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you might not even know who the artist is.

784
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,340
[SPEAKER_04]: You just recognize the song.

785
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:29,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Press Start in chat agrees with us.

786
00:57:29,522 --> 00:57:31,144
[SPEAKER_05]: The previews in Rock Band are evil.

787
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:33,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded like three more songs because of them.

788
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:35,187
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it.

789
00:57:36,808 --> 00:57:44,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was a little bit more that I saw about them trying to add more features that were based off of requests by the community, so that's pretty cool.

790
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:45,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be...

791
00:57:46,650 --> 00:58:13,905
[SPEAKER_04]: new content every week through 2008 so that's pretty cool that's of course only in the US right now that's pretty cool you know what I'm surprised they don't have yet is vision camera support or like you know camera support to basically film yourself doing your little rock concert shit you know in front of your TV or whatever with your friends and then posting it like a YouTube thing

792
00:58:15,919 --> 00:58:18,420
[SPEAKER_04]: with some sort of contest maybe lumped in with that.

793
00:58:19,681 --> 00:58:28,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Although at the same time I'm kind of glad they don't have that because that would be a motivation for some other people to try to get me to do things I don't want to do.

794
00:58:29,786 --> 00:58:31,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

795
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:36,149
[SPEAKER_04]: This week we've got a new download pack coming to Rock Band.

796
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:44,894
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually six songs from Boston and quite a few that you'll probably like here.

797
00:58:45,543 --> 00:58:57,226
[SPEAKER_04]: including, let's see here, Hitch a Ride, More Than a Feelin', Peace of Mind, Rock and Roll Band, Smokin', and Somethin' About You.

798
00:58:58,287 --> 00:59:00,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

799
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:05,209
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can buy that in a pack for 800 Microsoft points, or $10, or individually for 160 Microsoft points, or $1.99 each.

800
00:59:05,249 --> 00:59:07,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So you save $2 if you buy it all.

801
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:18,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened to you getting that rock band stage kit?

802
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:19,307
[SPEAKER_05]: When is it not out yet?

803
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:20,448
[SPEAKER_05]: When does that come out?

804
00:59:20,948 --> 00:59:21,248
[SPEAKER_05]: June.

805
00:59:22,548 --> 00:59:23,008
[SPEAKER_05]: June?

806
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:23,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

807
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:26,689
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to wait that long to rock?

808
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:28,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And we won't even be able to do it on Live 365?

809
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,550
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

810
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:30,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?

811
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:37,632
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those things that we need to have a camera for so we can see the entire garage being filled with smoke.

812
00:59:38,252 --> 00:59:41,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a little clip of Boston if you actually need a reminder.

813
00:59:46,178 --> 00:59:47,479
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the same song that's in Guitar Hero.

814
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:51,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's also in Chariots of Revolution.

815
00:59:57,306 --> 00:59:58,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Boston is great.

816
00:59:59,588 --> 01:00:00,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Boston is pretty awesome.

817
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:03,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, though, I want my Queen pack.

818
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:04,231
[SPEAKER_04]: My Journey pack.

819
01:00:04,752 --> 01:00:05,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my Journey pack?

820
01:00:06,713 --> 01:00:09,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I need me some Queen, because that'd be awesome.

821
01:00:11,425 --> 01:00:12,405
[SPEAKER_02]: She was funny in Cry Baby.

822
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:40,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I love Tracy Lord as an actress.

823
01:00:41,786 --> 01:00:42,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.

824
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:45,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yes, she was on the NBC show.

825
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:46,929
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it, The Pretenders for the longest time?

826
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:49,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you were talking about a fourth.

827
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,051
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, not that type of actress.

828
01:00:51,512 --> 01:00:55,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, you know, sure, people everywhere can appreciate her fine work there.

829
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:59,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, something else you folks can appreciate is free stuff.

830
01:00:59,637 --> 01:01:00,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't like free stuff?

831
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,159
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't if it's yours.

832
01:01:04,048 --> 01:01:07,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Something, well this isn't Yaris, it's actually on the Nintendo Wii.

833
01:01:07,511 --> 01:01:11,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of a, we're sorry, please forgive us type of thing.

834
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:18,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember how the whole Wii Guitar Hero, oh excuse me, the whole Guitar Hero, I eat toast and I burp.

835
01:01:19,382 --> 01:01:23,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember how the whole Guitar Hero 3 on the Nintendo Wii only had the mono sound in it?

836
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:26,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have to do all these replacement discs for the stereo sound now?

837
01:01:27,249 --> 01:01:31,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're also going to be getting a Guitar Hero faceplate.

838
01:01:31,934 --> 01:01:33,854
[SPEAKER_05]: A free Guitar Hero faceplate.

839
01:01:34,955 --> 01:01:36,355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually kind of neat looking.

840
01:01:36,395 --> 01:01:37,895
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like fire a little bit.

841
01:01:38,075 --> 01:01:43,636
[SPEAKER_05]: It's red and yellow and black, and it looks like a phoenix kind of rising up from this fire-ish looking thing.

842
01:01:43,736 --> 01:01:44,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of cool.

843
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:45,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

844
01:01:45,336 --> 01:01:48,017
[SPEAKER_05]: It's small black leather, and it says, Please don't sue us.

845
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:48,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't sue us.

846
01:01:49,657 --> 01:01:50,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Please no class action lawsuit.

847
01:01:51,157 --> 01:01:53,698
[SPEAKER_05]: By accepting this faceplate, you agree not to do a class action lawsuit.

848
01:01:53,738 --> 01:01:54,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

849
01:01:54,098 --> 01:01:55,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, don't you think that looks kind of cool?

850
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks better than the guitar I have in the living room.

851
01:01:58,419 --> 01:01:59,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

852
01:01:59,399 --> 01:01:59,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

853
01:02:01,295 --> 01:02:03,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate how the Wiimote goes in the guitar like that.

854
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:04,558
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so weird.

855
01:02:05,959 --> 01:02:09,202
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess it makes sense and probably makes things cost less.

856
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:15,467
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, free faceplate for those of you that are going to be getting the replacement discs for Guitar Hero on the Wii.

857
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:19,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand, it hijacks Wi-Fi like a college student in an apartment complex.

858
01:02:22,353 --> 01:02:24,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we please move on with the gaming news at this time?

859
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why not?

860
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:28,252
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

861
01:02:57,378 --> 01:03:07,423
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually were saying that there may be another version, another song pack for Guitar Hero that would be all Beatles stuff.

862
01:03:08,263 --> 01:03:24,211
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty cool, although I've been corrected as far as information in the article that their catalog cannot be distributed on iTunes because of a lawsuit going on between Apple and Apple Corp.

863
01:03:24,251 --> 01:03:24,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

864
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:26,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go into all that.

865
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Read Wikipedia.

866
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:37,525
[SPEAKER_02]: But they said that they're trying to work about bringing a few songs out for a particular song pack, so I think that'd be kind of cool.

867
01:03:40,026 --> 01:03:42,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they have to get the rights back from Michael Jackson?

868
01:03:42,727 --> 01:03:46,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did he sell that stuff when he started becoming poorer?

869
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:49,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

870
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the expert.

871
01:03:52,216 --> 01:03:58,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, another bad idea sounds like something coming from Ubisoft with their brand new title in their Imagine series.

872
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:00,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine, people actually buy this shit.

873
01:04:01,263 --> 01:04:02,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine Rockstar.

874
01:04:03,365 --> 01:04:07,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It is absolutely in no way a ripoff of Rockband, I'm sure.

875
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:14,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of revolves around fashion and stuff.

876
01:04:14,213 --> 01:04:18,376
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually, the Imagine series is meant for girls aged 6 to 14.

877
01:04:20,859 --> 01:04:22,620
[SPEAKER_04]: or in the case of Jamie, she likes Imagine Babies.

878
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:37,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will allow little girls, I guess, to be able to play drums, guitar, bass, and piano with each other via Wi-Fi.

879
01:04:37,728 --> 01:04:41,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And each instrument has its own unique control using the DS stylus.

880
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:48,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And players will be able to customize the look of each bandmate and create the most stylish rockers.

881
01:04:49,048 --> 01:04:50,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Only girls can play?

882
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:51,409
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not fair.

883
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:53,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, you two can play.

884
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:54,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

885
01:04:55,510 --> 01:05:01,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And they worked their way up the charts to become the number one recording band.

886
01:05:01,372 --> 01:05:02,613
[SPEAKER_05]: How is that different from Rock Band?

887
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:06,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you get to dress your characters in Rock Band?

888
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:09,015
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand, this is shitty.

889
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:11,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band, not so crappy.

890
01:05:13,297 --> 01:05:14,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

891
01:05:16,155 --> 01:05:17,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine MasterChef Imagine MasterChef

892
01:05:41,932 --> 01:05:48,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear them, I don't want to say defend themselves, but let's hear about their contributions to the gaming scene.

893
01:05:48,675 --> 01:05:49,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to hear from the horse's mouth.

894
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:53,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I make fun of them because it's not my demographic.

895
01:05:53,276 --> 01:05:54,196
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

896
01:05:55,097 --> 01:05:59,658
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a problem with a lot of games not being focused towards girls.

897
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:02,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they are kind of working that market.

898
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with UFO Interactive.

899
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,201
[SPEAKER_04]: They make a lot of these, like, was it,

900
01:06:07,685 --> 01:06:11,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart Boys Game Room, Smart Girls Dream House, type thing like that.

901
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:15,812
[SPEAKER_04]: It's games that are aimed at kids that are three years old.

902
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:19,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, really get you hooked young.

903
01:06:19,054 --> 01:06:19,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Start them young.

904
01:06:19,995 --> 01:06:20,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

905
01:06:20,615 --> 01:06:24,018
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's nice that they're aiming for this demographic.

906
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:28,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, though, it's easy fodder for us in the press to just kind of make fun of it because...

907
01:06:29,488 --> 01:06:31,109
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't understand it, and it's different.

908
01:06:31,249 --> 01:06:33,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in my day, we had Mario is Missing, and we liked it.

909
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:43,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario is Missing was great, and besides that, I personally, for some of these, I don't really feel like perpetuating any type of stereotypical behavior or traditional roles.

910
01:06:44,015 --> 01:06:53,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's up to... It's just like when Nintendo tried Super Princess Peach, and that flopped, and so they said, fuck it, boys will play games, girls will do nothing.

911
01:06:55,618 --> 01:06:56,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I play games.

912
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:58,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Super Princess Peach.

913
01:06:58,359 --> 01:06:59,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw you.

914
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I like shooting things in games.

915
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:06,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like... You will play your Kirby and your Peach games and you will like them.

916
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:07,402
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

917
01:07:07,502 --> 01:07:08,282
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

918
01:07:08,382 --> 01:07:16,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the chat room is just going off with all these different Imagine things, but Amaze Hatsuma, I like this one, says, Imagine these games in a landfill next to E.T.

919
01:07:18,026 --> 01:07:18,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I...

920
01:07:19,022 --> 01:07:20,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I like violent games.

921
01:07:20,383 --> 01:07:22,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee says Peach is awesome in Brawl.

922
01:07:22,543 --> 01:07:23,544
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually true.

923
01:07:24,384 --> 01:07:26,345
[SPEAKER_05]: The two characters I use most are Pit and Peach.

924
01:07:27,045 --> 01:07:28,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the Foo Foo Games.

925
01:07:29,386 --> 01:07:30,406
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the Peach Pit.

926
01:07:30,906 --> 01:07:31,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob!

927
01:07:31,307 --> 01:07:31,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it?

928
01:07:31,687 --> 01:07:31,907
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

929
01:07:32,247 --> 01:07:33,527
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like Foo Foo Games.

930
01:07:33,627 --> 01:07:35,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think I have to play Foo Foo Games?

931
01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:37,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's funny.

932
01:07:37,589 --> 01:07:38,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Explosive Portal.

933
01:07:38,649 --> 01:07:39,249
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the joke.

934
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:40,610
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

935
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like Final Fantasy Tactics?

936
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:42,691
No.

937
01:07:43,071 --> 01:07:44,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then this is not for you.

938
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:45,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy Tactics A2!

939
01:07:46,445 --> 01:07:48,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII

940
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:15,862
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit, I guess.

941
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:16,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out loosely.

942
01:08:18,103 --> 01:08:20,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Another way to whore that series even more.

943
01:08:20,643 --> 01:08:22,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop whoring your Final Fantasy series.

944
01:08:22,484 --> 01:08:23,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Final Fantasy XII was a good game.

945
01:08:23,944 --> 01:08:26,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Make one game, move to the next number.

946
01:08:26,744 --> 01:08:31,185
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not need to expand upon this series in tactics games.

947
01:08:31,325 --> 01:08:34,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides, I mean, I don't know.

948
01:08:34,746 --> 01:08:36,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Revenant Wings, did you play much of that?

949
01:08:36,827 --> 01:08:37,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

950
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:37,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

951
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:38,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

952
01:08:39,587 --> 01:08:41,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool, you can be the killer tomato in this game.

953
01:08:41,648 --> 01:08:43,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least I think you fight the killer tomato.

954
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:43,848
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

955
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,581
[SPEAKER_05]: This game actually looks kind of rad.

956
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:51,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I still need to beat Final Fantasy XII, though, and that other Final Fantasy game you bought me on DS, Loki.

957
01:08:53,065 --> 01:08:53,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like fun.

958
01:08:55,986 --> 01:08:57,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we'll be hearing from our listeners on this game.

959
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we hear from them about everything else.

960
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:02,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hi!

961
01:09:04,171 --> 01:09:08,974
[SPEAKER_02]: No, um... We know Codemasters, right?

962
01:09:09,514 --> 01:09:10,335
[SPEAKER_02]: We're familiar with them.

963
01:09:10,675 --> 01:09:10,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

964
01:09:11,956 --> 01:09:12,556
[SPEAKER_02]: They, um...

965
01:09:13,203 --> 01:09:20,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Codemasters Online Gaming basically said that they want to do two MMOs for home consoles.

966
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:30,937
[SPEAKER_02]: They were saying that they've had a little bit of success already in the market, and so they're looking to bring stuff out for PlayStation 3.

967
01:09:30,997 --> 01:09:35,601
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the ones listed, and they're saying that now is the right time to hop on it.

968
01:09:37,102 --> 01:09:42,667
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not anything specific yet, but they said that they're really going to gear it for the consoles.

969
01:09:43,915 --> 01:09:49,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I personally don't think MMOs work very well on consoles unless it's like, you know, PSO.

970
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:54,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what I'm hoping, and I know they don't make this game, at least not Codemasters.

971
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:59,422
[SPEAKER_04]: APB, that game that's coming out that's just like Saints Row, but it's an MMO.

972
01:09:59,782 --> 01:10:05,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to God that I don't have to pay month to month for that thing, because I really want to play it, like, badly.

973
01:10:05,505 --> 01:10:07,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, most MMOs you do have to pay month to month for.

974
01:10:07,866 --> 01:10:09,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but Guild Wars you don't, okay?

975
01:10:09,186 --> 01:10:12,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And they really need to follow that line of thought there.

976
01:10:13,217 --> 01:10:15,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, look at Guild Wars.

977
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:15,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at it.

978
01:10:17,658 --> 01:10:17,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Learn it.

979
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:17,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.

980
01:10:18,018 --> 01:10:22,940
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of games out there that are free to play and you buy download content.

981
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,620
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they should do.

982
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:27,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give out free games and then I'll pay for download content later on.

983
01:10:27,841 --> 01:10:28,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Second Life?

984
01:10:30,102 --> 01:10:31,362
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Second Life is stupid.

985
01:10:31,603 --> 01:10:33,363
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like if I wanted to go pick up Virtual Horde.

986
01:10:33,383 --> 01:10:34,083
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game's free.

987
01:10:34,924 --> 01:10:36,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It is free and you get what you pay for.

988
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:37,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And you pay for your downloadable content.

989
01:10:38,965 --> 01:10:42,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but that's a game that... You just described Second Life.

990
01:10:44,127 --> 01:10:46,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Second Life's a bad example, because that game sucks.

991
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:48,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not really a game, it's just an addiction.

992
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the MySpace of MMOs, okay?

993
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:56,034
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does specifically do what you were suggesting.

994
01:10:56,474 --> 01:10:58,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it does, but it sucks at it.

995
01:10:58,896 --> 01:11:08,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what I'm trying to say, though, there's other games out there that are also free to play, and most of them are Korean, because apparently they understand how to make a good MMO.

996
01:11:09,222 --> 01:11:11,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Or apparently Malaysian, like one of my friends was on.

997
01:11:11,929 --> 01:11:18,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure, Malaysia, where a lot of piracy used to come out of, and yet they're making good games that are free.

998
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:19,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

999
01:11:20,012 --> 01:11:20,592
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird.

1000
01:11:22,252 --> 01:11:24,873
[SPEAKER_04]: But I digress.

1001
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:38,918
[SPEAKER_04]: There's kind of a little bit of a different topic here, but once again, and we haven't heard about this in a while, Massachusetts now is considering the whole games as porn bill.

1002
01:11:38,938 --> 01:11:39,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1003
01:11:41,155 --> 01:11:45,036
[SPEAKER_04]: House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423

1004
01:12:10,053 --> 01:12:18,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the assistance of, or from, of course, well, this right here is why the bill is bad in the first place.

1005
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:23,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Voldemort was the, you know, inspiration on that bill.

1006
01:12:24,357 --> 01:12:38,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, legislative sponsor, Republican Linda, or I'm sorry, Representative Linda Dorcina Forey, who happens to be a Democrat.

1007
01:12:39,728 --> 01:12:47,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, of course, you know, this thing, much like all the other ones in the past, will fail because it's not constitutional.

1008
01:12:47,795 --> 01:12:56,783
[SPEAKER_04]: But, at the same time, you know, what do we gotta do to stop these people from wasting our tax dollars on these bills that they know they're gonna fail?

1009
01:12:58,264 --> 01:13:04,009
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like the fuckin'... Is it so that when they rerun for office, they can say, like, hey, I took a stand against this...

1010
01:13:05,148 --> 01:13:09,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games are poisoning your children and I take a stand against this.

1011
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:10,832
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob and I approve this message.

1012
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:12,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, great.

1013
01:13:12,933 --> 01:13:16,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really for their own personal gain and it's still wasting taxpayers' money.

1014
01:13:16,956 --> 01:13:18,177
[SPEAKER_04]: All the more reason you should hate it.

1015
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:20,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1016
01:13:20,919 --> 01:13:23,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Do our children really need to be protected from games?

1017
01:13:23,961 --> 01:13:27,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, do we really need the government to step in to tell our children what's okay to play?

1018
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, are we that retarded?

1019
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:33,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some people are that retarded, but I would like to think that, you know...

1020
01:13:34,525 --> 01:13:35,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of us are not that retarded.

1021
01:13:36,725 --> 01:13:41,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if we're all that retarded, then who the hell are we going to elect in as president?

1022
01:13:42,187 --> 01:13:43,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I promise you shiny things.

1023
01:13:44,027 --> 01:13:45,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you got my vote.

1024
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:48,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1025
01:13:50,828 --> 01:13:51,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

1026
01:13:52,248 --> 01:13:56,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sure we'll hear about this game later when it fails.

1027
01:13:57,349 --> 01:14:00,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, or the bill, not the game.

1028
01:14:00,632 --> 01:14:10,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, we're going to get to the end of Part A of our show here, but not before we pay a little respect to our elders in the segment we always do every single week here on the program.

1029
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:14,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It's DarkSakura's Classic Video Game of the Week.

1030
01:14:19,408 --> 01:14:21,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So, DarkSakura, you've dug through the archives.

1031
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:24,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You've verified this pic is not a duplicate per the wiki.

1032
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:27,775
[SPEAKER_05]: What classic game should the kids be checking out this week?

1033
01:14:28,456 --> 01:14:28,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Jackal.

1034
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:33,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Jackal is a great game because you drive tanks and blow up shit.

1035
01:14:34,783 --> 01:14:35,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Best game ever.

1036
01:14:37,744 --> 01:14:40,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I'm talking about the Nintendo version specifically.

1037
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:41,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to the music, it's cool.

1038
01:14:44,308 --> 01:14:44,768
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that?

1039
01:14:44,788 --> 01:14:45,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to play this game.

1040
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:51,592
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Akari Warriors, but you're in a jeep.

1041
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:55,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is the game, though, that makes me think of that line from Hot Shots.

1042
01:14:56,135 --> 01:14:57,115
[SPEAKER_02]: War is fantastic.

1043
01:14:57,275 --> 01:14:58,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

1044
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,281
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, which I don't really believe.

1045
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:05,563
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I love Jackal just because, okay, I actually have memories of this game.

1046
01:15:06,183 --> 01:15:18,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Before my papa, who is my dad's dad, before he died, we would actually sit in front of the big screen TV, and we're talking like, you know, early 90s style big screen, so this is a big deal.

1047
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing the Nintendo.

1048
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:22,271
[SPEAKER_02]: and playing Jackal with Papa.

1049
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:22,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.

1050
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:29,254
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, the game actually, um, it was, um, an arcade, um, released in Japan.

1051
01:15:29,314 --> 01:15:33,035
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called, um, Tokushu Butai, uh, Jakaru, which would be Jackal.

1052
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:36,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Special Forces Unit Jackal, which was released in the U.S.

1053
01:15:37,156 --> 01:15:37,936
[SPEAKER_02]: as Top Gunner.

1054
01:15:38,937 --> 01:15:43,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, basically the whole point of the game is you go through and you can, uh,

1055
01:15:44,346 --> 01:15:55,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Run over... Well, I like to run them over, but you can shoot down enemy soldiers wandering around, and you rescue POWs, and you have to actually take them to the extraction point where a helicopter will run off with them.

1056
01:15:56,114 --> 01:16:01,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um... Then you fight, like, whatever your boss is at the end of the level.

1057
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:09,704
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um... Again, it came out over here in the arcade as Top Gunner, but it did come out as Jackal on the Nintendo.

1058
01:16:10,845 --> 01:16:12,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, though, for, um...

1059
01:16:13,706 --> 01:16:30,992
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone who happened to be one of those few people who has a Famicom Disk System, it was brought out as Final Commando Akai Yosai, which basically is Final Command The Red Fortress.

1060
01:16:32,793 --> 01:16:39,135
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's just really fun, and on top of that, when you play two player, it does force you to cooperate because

1061
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:45,330
[SPEAKER_02]: There gets to a point where if one person's going one way, it won't let your other person advance.

1062
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:49,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes one person can draw fire while the other person goes in and does something else.

1063
01:16:50,531 --> 01:16:56,573
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a cool, I think kind of a unique one for the whole run-and-gun sort of series.

1064
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:03,975
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually blow up different areas in the game where there's hidden stuff.

1065
01:17:04,215 --> 01:17:05,675
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get extra power-ups.

1066
01:17:06,256 --> 01:17:07,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get...

1067
01:17:09,019 --> 01:17:35,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocket Launchers I actually preferred to keep the grenades because the grenades would go over a wall whereas rockets just sort of explode on the wall It was really cool I like how you pick up the little dudes I didn't play this game a whole lot I think I remember playing it once and I just wasn't that into it I guess when I was younger but I like how you pick up the little dudes from the houses and then drop them off at the plane and it's like a rescue mission thing It's cool

1068
01:17:35,683 --> 01:17:48,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can keep upgrading your missiles to where you get your missile launcher, you get one with a higher range, you get one that produces shrapnel, and an area damage missile that shoots out from left and right.

1069
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:51,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I still preferred the grenades because they went over the walls.

1070
01:17:54,278 --> 01:17:58,281
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also control which direction you fire in, which was pretty cool.

1071
01:17:58,461 --> 01:18:01,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can turn and fire forward in a different way.

1072
01:18:01,463 --> 01:18:02,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like a tank.

1073
01:18:03,204 --> 01:18:04,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it was really cool.

1074
01:18:04,665 --> 01:18:06,306
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite ever games.

1075
01:18:07,006 --> 01:18:13,070
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, I actually have really good memories of the game, so it was kind of cool.

1076
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:23,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, there was a bootleg version of Top Gunner that would let you use the Ikari Warriors style controls.

1077
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:24,906
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty cool.

1078
01:18:26,246 --> 01:18:35,508
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a version on the IBM PC in 1988, like I said, the Famicom Disk System, and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.

1079
01:18:37,869 --> 01:18:40,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the inevitable Xbox Live Arcade port at some point, probably.

1080
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:41,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine this high-res?

1081
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:42,750
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be pretty awesome.

1082
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:43,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

1083
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:52,172
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Jackal, in this case on the NES, but on a variety of systems, as DarkSakura pointed out.

1084
01:18:52,432 --> 01:18:52,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.

1085
01:18:54,713 --> 01:18:57,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and that's our cue to take a quick break.

1086
01:18:57,855 --> 01:18:59,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's exactly what we're going to do.

1087
01:18:59,576 --> 01:19:05,581
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a break and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.

1088
01:19:06,301 --> 01:19:11,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1089
01:19:11,765 --> 01:19:16,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
