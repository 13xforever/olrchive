Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's a host, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, March 23, 2008, Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live gets a new expansion,

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Gibson sues even more businesses over Guitar Hero,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
and could Kid Icarus be really making a comeback this year?

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Yo.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
How are you, Miss Summers?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm full of waffles.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Enjoying the Easter waffles. Isn't this a tradition in your fam?

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, with our big group of people.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Although it seems that every year there's a new baby added with our friends who join us.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Because one year they have Bob, the next year they have Tatiana is her name.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
They call her Tater.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
That's a nice name for a child, Tater.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
She's cute. She's a cutie.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I don't doubt it. Babies are cute.

01:22.000 --> 01:36.000
And, um, um, we basically just, you know, went to Marie Callender's and got, well, everyone goes, I finally learned my lesson after doing this for eight years.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
Is, um, they always go through the omelet line, and I get sick on the omelets every year for some reason.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
So I was like, screw your omelets! I'm having eggs Benedict and waffles.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
And I had waffles and chocolate eclairs.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Here we go with the whole Food Network thing again.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I swear, our podcast. Video Games Plus Food Equals Yum.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
That was great.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
That was the alternate name for our podcast, by the way.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
No, I'm making that up.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Alright, well, Happy Easter to you, Dark Soccer. I'm glad to hear it.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
And the blessed Ostara to you.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Waffly good for you.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And Happy Easter, whatever the heck it is you guys all celebrate.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Well, technically the Spring Equinox is Friday.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
If anything. Huh?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
The Spring Equinox is Friday.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Alright, then Happy Equinox. Happy whatever.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Happy day. Just happy day.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Happy day, Loki. Tech Master Loki, also here every week.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Hello.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
How are you?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm okay.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Did you do anything special today? Did the Easter Bunny leave you anything good?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
No, I just went over to my mom's house and we barbecued ribs.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Mmm ribs!

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
You guys have interesting ways of spending Easter.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I mean, interesting good. Not like interesting bad.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
But more food.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Or as Frisbee in Chat Room says,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
chat.orangelandtrader.com, the always present fourth guest on the show.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Waffle Lounge Foodio.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
That could be the name of the show. Waffle Lounge Foodio.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
You could play the waffle song from Mystery Science Theater.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
No, we're not going to play the waffle song right now.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
We're going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week, but first a teaser.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
A little teaser.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
We have big news to talk about. Like, big.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Like, we just found out 30 minutes ago big.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
We'll be talking about that in just a moment.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
I know a lot of people in chat are kind of going like WTF because they can hear us on Justin TV talking and like want to know what's up.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
And yes, someone died. I killed them.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
No, no one died.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
The ferret died. Where has he been for the past like year?

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Actually, I found the ferret the other day and then I put him back in the dusty corner and I found him and...

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Hey, you should have brought the ferret out.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
It was uneventful.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Really.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
That's it?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
It was uneventful.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
No DSing? No Ragnarok? No nothing?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, I played Ragnarok.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, of course. Of course. I mean, that goes without saying.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
But I actually did not touch my DS all week. I moved that game.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
That game that Dan brought me home that I'm not going to play.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
The Professor whatever the fuck it is.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Professor Layton?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
You know, I've heard a lot of good things about that game. You might actually want to check it out at some point.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
He's hearing. I'm not going to play it.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Well, then give it to me. I'll play it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Well, you can borrow it.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
She doesn't like learning games. She's above that.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah, you don't like learning.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
No, I've already learned.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
And I found your copy of Every Extend Extra.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Sweet.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Oh, that's where it went.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
At my house. It got lost in the vault.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Things disappear at Dark Sakura's house.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
That's okay. I found some of Kristen's movies, too.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Alright.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Alright, well, then since your gaming week was uneventful, I'll turn to Loki. How was your gaming week?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I wish I could say I was much better.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I did play a game.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
I played Saints Row multiplayer and also the single player stuff because that's why I was playing during lunch.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
Now, really this week, though, I was still trying to fix that one 360. I have it now not three-ringed anymore.

04:47.000 --> 04:56.000
So, I just have to see if it stays that way because I don't know if I mentioned this, but I had a third 360 go down on me now.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
So, now it's three there, three ringed, and three there not.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
So, what percentage of Xbox 360s does that make?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
50.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
50% of them.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
50%.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Luckily, this new one, though, what I did for this one, or I'm planning on doing, is right now it's in one of the clear cases.

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
So, I'm going to put the old case back on it, and then I bought off of eBay a security label from Microsoft,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
you know, one of the ones that they removed on there.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
So, I'm going to slap that back on there, and they can fucking replace the thing because I'm not touching it, bastards.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, and I'm addressing this comment in chat because some people may not know.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Mike W. says, how many 360s does Loki have again?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
So, please refresh us.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
How many 360s do you have?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I have six.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
And why that many?

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
I had to land them in a game room, and I got them for that.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
That's amazing.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
That's amazing.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, I had five originally, but then I bought one to replace another one, but I ended up fixing the original.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
So, we have six.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Wow.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
One that hopefully will be fixed here pretty soon because, like I said, it's not three ringed anymore,

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
but I think it may have overheated so many times that it's damaged, but we'll see.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
And then this last one, which I'm sending to Microsoft, so that will be fixed.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
So, hopefully it will all be fixed at one point.

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
But it's not very promising that three out of the six have died within the last, like, three months.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't know.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Nice.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
So, that's all I really got around to playing this week.

06:25.000 --> 06:33.000
I do have a lot of stuff lined up for this week, including K Project, which is that Res Beta that got released out there.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
So, I want to try that because that looks cool.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
I've got to dig out my Dreamcast for that.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
And then Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh, actually I played a little bit of Smash Brothers this week.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Just space emissary stuff.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
Oh, and I added everybody in the goddamn friends code list, so stop your bitching.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Okay, seriously.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Nobody was online when I was online earlier, so you know what?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Stop complaining.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Talking about the Orange Lounge Radio forum thread, right?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Of course.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
That's what I thought.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah, I added everyone.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
No, I didn't add everyone, but I added most people, like...

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
No, I think I might have added everyone.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
So, because I have, like, 40 codes in there, and I've hardly ever played Smash Brothers.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
But I'm guessing since Loki's done, I'll go over to my game a week.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I have been playing Smash Brothers a little bit.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
I've been working mostly on, like, the single player stuff, not emissary mode for some reason.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
Because my friend played, like, 70% through emissary mode, so I didn't even really have to.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I mean, I guess I should go back to his file and beat it or something so I can get some of those characters.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
But I've been working mostly on single player and trying to unlock everything in the gallery.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Like, you know, play five brawls with Princess Peach to get Super Mario 2 and, like, things like that.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I've been trying to do as much of that stuff as I can.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
So, good times.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
And otherwise, I haven't been playing a whole lot.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
I went back to the Xbox 360 and just played some random old stuff.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Nothing really of note was playing some World of Warcraft, but I was out of town this weekend.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And I was staying about a block from the Metreon.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Didn't even think to go there.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Just didn't, it's not what it used to be.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
You know, if you were there next week, you could actually go to a Crysis core launch party.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That's alright.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Well, actually, I do have to go back to San Francisco next week anyway.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
So, maybe I'll check it out.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Well, it's like Tuesday.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Oh, never mind. I'm not going on a weekday.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Hmm, interesting.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Alright.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
So, yeah, no new games to review this week.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
That's kind of odd.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I've been playing Scrabulous on Facebook.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
It's just like Scrabble.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I rented a movie on the Xbox Live movie service thing.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Oh, what'd you rent?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I rented Dark City.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
And how was that?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
That's a cool movie.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I've seen it before, so it was cool.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Was it in HD?

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
No, they didn't have an HD version of that, but it's just standard definition.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
It wasn't that expensive.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
240 points.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And, fuck, it's pretty easy.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
You don't have to wait that long.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
You just kind of download it and about, I'd say, 30 seconds later, you could start watching it.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah, it just depends on your bandwidth.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
If you have dial-up, you might have a problem.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Well, if you have dial-up, I don't think you're going to fucking be downloading a movie.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
That would suck.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
One gigabyte file?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah, no thanks.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I don't know. It was okay.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I just want to hear something funny, too.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Actually, I have a friend at work right now who's really into rock band,

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
and he keeps playing all the hard songs for me and then locking me achievements.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Nice.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Because, you know, I can't fucking play the game on hard.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
What am I talking about?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I can play guitar. I can't do drums.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Oh, I played rock band this week.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
I played a lot of rock band this week, actually.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
That's why you take it to parties.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Because of that new, and I don't want to spoil the story of this coming up,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
but some of you guys know, rock band had some enhancements this week,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
and we'll talk about them a little more a little later on,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
but I went to check them out.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
I haven't checked the rock band store in a long time,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
and I forgot that you can get some Nine Inch Nails songs that are pretty cool,

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
and I got that.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And then the B-52s have a song on there, so I had to get that,

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
so I went shopping on rock band because I heart microtransactions.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
I've spent way too much money.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Not really, but yeah, I've spent way too much money.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, way too much on rock band, seriously.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
But just think, the next party we have is going to be so bitchin' with rock band.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
So we need a rock band party.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
The thing though, they don't make it very easy because of that stupid digital rights management.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
You know, anything I download, and if I bring it over here,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
whatever, I have to be logged in on live in order for all that content to be available.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
It sucks.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Yeah, it really blows.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
ActDeft is crying in chat.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
He says, Mexico still can't access the music store in rock band.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
You know what, in some ways it's a good thing,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
because then you just start spending money so stupidly,

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
because you're like, oh, I have points.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I could just spend them.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
That's a sad face.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
What?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
That is a sad face.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
That is a sad face.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Very sad face.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
So, there you have it.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
Okay, so let's get to the big news, and it actually really sucks.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
Like, there's really no easy way for us to kind of mention this.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
Literally we just heard about some of the changes that have been going on with our streaming provider,

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
which is Live 365, literally about 30 minutes before our show went live tonight,

11:07.000 --> 11:14.000
and the long and the short of it is that Live 365 is making some obscene changes in their pricing policies,

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
and they are going to be upping their rates to these obscene amounts.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
Basically right now we pay about $60 a month to have about 100 live listeners.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
We would have to pay under this new plan $120 a month for 60 live listeners,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
which would only barely accommodate what we do on Sundays.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Usually we don't talk about ratings.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
We get about 50 to 60 live people on a good Sunday night,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
and we've actually gone beyond that before.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I think our highest show had 70 or 80.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I think we've hit higher than 80.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I want to say we have, but I don't know.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
It just sucks because it kind of came out of nowhere.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Supposedly, Live 365 sent an email a month ago.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I don't know. I never got it, so whatever.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
They're upping these rates, and even if we could afford it, we kind of don't want to.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
We've made a decision that we will be leaving Live 365 effective on April 12th.

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
So that really sucks because that means the feed that we started in May of 2002 is going away.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I wish this was an April Fool's joke chat.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It's not. It's completely legitimate.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
This is not an April Fool's joke, like a preemptive strike or something,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
because it's not even April yet.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
But we have no choice but to leave Live 365.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
You'll note I said we are not quitting the show,

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
so the question is now how do we continue to do Orange Lounge Radio,

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
but not with Live 365, who we've kind of had for about five and a half years and so on.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
And trust me, a lot of the obvious things you guys are talking about in chat,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
we're thinking about them too.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
So we've sent some emails.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
We've kind of put our feelers out there and done some discussion

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
to see what we can do over the next week,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
and we'll hopefully have further information to announce for you guys next week.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
And whether that's our own shoutcast, I haven't the foggiest idea.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
Again, guys, you have to understand literally we found out about this like 30 minutes to an hour ago,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
so we're still trying to kind of scramble to.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
But regardless, our live feed will be closing effective April 12th,

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
meaning that those of you guys that listen at work to the lovely video game music

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
that plays all day long and the retro lunch and all that, it's going away.

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
And what I feel most horrible for are the other live folks that we've had

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
bless our stream with their presence for their hard work in live shows over the years,

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
including DMN, including Travis Donovan, of course,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
including extra for back when he had his show,

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
including the three of us that do our spinoff shows and we feel like it,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
and the things that we had planned that we wanted to do with the live feed

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
that now all those plans are effectively off, unfortunately.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
And obviously we'll do whatever we can for our friends that broadcast as well,

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
but we have to kind of like our number one priority right now is relocating our Sunday show first,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
and then we'll see what we can do after that.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Act Def asked, what's going to happen to DM Insanity and TDL?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I hope they keep going.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I hope they keep going somehow, but unfortunately,

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio won't be around for them to do that with.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
So Orange Lounge Radio kind of ends in a way on April 12th

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
because Orange Lounge Radio was the radio station.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
This show is actually Orange Lounge Radio Live,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
but obviously over the years it's just been like Orange Lounge Radio.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
So yeah, I don't know.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
The next week is going to be very interesting.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
So that's the news.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
If you have suggestions or offers, I guess, I don't know,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
send us an email.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
You can contact me in my personal email box,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
rob at orangeloungeradio.com or our general email bag,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
mailbagorangeloungeradio.com.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
We think we know what we want to do.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
We think we know the option that makes the most sense to us,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
but it involves other people.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
We have to make sure they want to do it too.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
So that's that.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
You got anything else you guys want to add?

15:20.000 --> 15:20.000
I don't know.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
I've kind of been dying.

15:21.000 --> 15:21.000
I don't know.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
If you don't like what's going on, you send your emails,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
I'd say, to the Live 365.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Professionally, please.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah, professionally.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And then in turn, they hopefully will send emails

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
to whomever is charging them.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Unfortunately, I think that they probably

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
know what's going to happen because they're raising

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
all the rates on their stations.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Obviously, a lot of people are just

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
going to forego paying those rates and just quit

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
or find elsewhere, and that's unfortunate.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I imagine we're not the only station that's doing this.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And I'm sure that they didn't have, you know,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
it wasn't really their choice to do that,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
but that's kind of they have to build.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It does go back to the royalty things you've probably

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
heard about from the past year.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
At least that's what they're blaming it on,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
but I still think it was kind of a bit out of left field.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
It gives them taking advantage of that situation

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
for their own personal gain.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I can't help but feel there's a little of that going on.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Anything you want to add, Jamie?

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
As to somebody who's been a live broadcaster for this long?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Not really.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Not that it hasn't already been said.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
So, it sucks.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Wah, wah.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Only to get a fuse.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
No.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Ross Steele, UT, says Life 365 is simply

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
using the RIAA boogeyman as an excuse to screw people.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't want to knock them right now,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
but let me put it this way.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
We have the money to keep going if we wanted to.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
We could do the 60 listener limit,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
but we just kind of don't want to.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
We think we can do better.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
This is more of an incentive.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
It kind of shows us that like, hey, Orange Launch Radio,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
you guys have been kind of lazy the past six years.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Just stay on the Life 365, because it was convenient

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and it was there, and you just touch a button

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
and everything's all set up.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
So, this is really going to kind of force

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
us to explore alternatives.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
And it could be exciting.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
It could be the beginning of big change.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Big change.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
When one door closes, another opens.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Absolutely right.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I was just going to check that out.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
This is also another option right here.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
They have actually people that do hosting for unlimited listeners.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
We'll see.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Maybe.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
We'll see.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Maybe.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Maybe.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
I don't know.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
So, we'll see over the next week.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
We're exploring lots and lots of ideas.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
So that's that.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Obviously, our number one priority is keeping this show going.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
I don't think that many people's worlds will be crushed without a 24-7 music feed.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I apologize to those that have been listening to our 24-7 music feed.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I know there are some that do,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
but obviously Sunday show is the priority for us right now.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
So, we'll see.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
All right.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Too much bad news tonight.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Too much bad news.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
We need to get into some other news.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
The show will continue.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Even if we have to do a non-live show for a couple of weeks, we will.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
While we relocate, we'll do whatever it takes,

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
but we don't plan on shutting down this show,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
the Sunday night program as it is.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
So, that's that.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
So, we're still here.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Na-na-na-na-na.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
You can't shut us down that easily.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
All right.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Let's get into other housekeeping tonight.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
The other housekeeping tonight, of course,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
a happy Easter or whatever it is you celebrate today.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
If nothing at all, then happy Sunday to you.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
To all of our Orange Launch Radio listeners,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
yes, we are here live on Easter

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
because everybody, I guess, did their stuff this morning.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I went to the Bay Area this weekend,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
had a very lovely weekend in San Francisco.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
It was good.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Speaking of San Francisco, this is more of a personal favor.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
I promised some friends of mine.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It's another hobby of mine that I do,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
and I promised them I would plug this on the show.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
It's kind of a live appearance for me, so to speak,

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
and it would only work if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
so I apologize to our listeners who are not.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
But on Friday, April 25th,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
in the city of San Francisco at the Clay Theater,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
which is at Clay and Fillmore in San Francisco,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm going to be appearing in a live showing of Shock Treatment,

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
which is a movie that is the sequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, sort of.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I mean, it's not really the sequel, but...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
It has the same characters?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Kind of. It has Brad and Janet.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
If you see it, watch it again so that you'll get it.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah, exactly.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And the thing is that they do Rocky Horror Picture Show,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
and I've been involved with that for a long time.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
You know, the show I did before Orange Lawns Radio actually started

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
because of Travis and I's mutual love of Rocky Horror Picture Show

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
under Station Live.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
I still am involved with that, not as heavily as I used to be,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
but I still respect the scene and the counterculture that it provides.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
This is very rare to have this show on the big screen.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
This is probably the only time this year, outside of a convention,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
this will show on the big screen, anywhere.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
So it's Friday, April 25th.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I'm going to be in it. I'm in the cast.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
It's a huge cast. There's like 15 to 20 other people.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
So check that out. It's at the Clay Theater, April 25th.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
And a guy that was actually in the movie is going to be there, too,

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Gary Shale.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
He was an Oscar drill of Oscar drilling the bits.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
He's going to be there, and he's performing live at the show.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Is he going to play the same character?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
That'd be funny.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
About 20 years later, I think so.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I don't think he's going to be in the movie,

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
but he's going to do a live performance of probably that song,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
and I think he's done a musical career since then,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
so maybe like one or two of his other songs.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
I want to go.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
That's pretty cool.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
You should go. It'll be fun.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I'll have to arrange work earlier that day.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
All right. So it'll be fun. Friday, April 25th.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Completely different than video games,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
but I promised the cast I would give them a shout-out.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Shout-out!

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
The Orange Lounge Radio Wiki.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Jamie, I showed you that before the show.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Isn't that awesome, the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki?

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
I love it that you're missing some jokes.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
You need to go old school.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
We have like, you know, cake, death cake.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
There's lots of old school jokes,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
but I've got to say I'm very impressed with the work

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
that the folks that have been working on the Wiki have done.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Again, the place that the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki is at,

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
orangeloungeradio.wiki, that's W-I-K-I-A dot com,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
and just to give you an idea of what's there,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
and this is all the listeners that have been doing this.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
This is incredible.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
They have a page of like inside jokes from the show

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
that includes like the locust, tingle, bet,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and just some of the other things that have come up on the show,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
and there's been...

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
They can hear the plane over the live feed right.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Can they hear that on the podcast?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
They're hearing that on Justin TV.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Probably Justin TV because the mic's right by the window.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Oh yeah, because the window's open.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah, they probably can hear the plane outside.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Okay, yes, we live by an Air Force base,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
or it's not actually...

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
It was an Air Force base.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Air Force base.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
It used to be an Air Force base.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
It used to be an Air Force base.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
It was a CHP.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Oh, somebody's breaking the law.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
We don't live that far.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Sorry.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Isn't it now like a business airport is what they use at Fort primarily?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Like FedEx?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
And air shows.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah, and air shows.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Oh God, the air shows.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Oh God.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I mean, the Blue Angels kind of get old to me after the first couple times,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
and they're so loud.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
I used to go see the Blue Angels when I was a kid, okay?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
That's how fucking old they are.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It's just really...

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
No, we've always lived by the airport,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
but now it's just tonight the window's open because it's hot here now,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
so we have the fan on and the window open.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah, and I think it's bad now.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
We only get to like 110 outside.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
By the way, I found out the information for you on an air conditioner.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
All right, excellent.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
We'll talk about that later.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
That's the reason why we can't afford Live 365.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Because we need an air conditioner.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
We just have, you know.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
All right, enough about the plane.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Okay, where the hell was I?

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I was talking about the inside jokes, and they've compiled...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Okay, get this.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
There's a list of every single Orange Lounge radio episode,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
at least the two go in podcast editions,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
and like Dark Tetsuya or somebody went through,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I don't know if this is everybody,

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
they actually listed what happened on every single episode.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
It's nuts.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And then like Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
an entire archive of the Classic Game of the Week is up there.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Which helps me tremendously.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Yes, because now she won't repeat anything on accident.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Exactly, because I was actually looking at the game I picked today,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
goes, I've mentioned this so much, should I already do it?

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
So we'll find out what that game is a little later on.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
And we'll see, it'll be a race to see who can add it to the wiki first,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
what the game is tonight.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
So we'll get to that a little later in the show.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
All right, but let's get to some gaming news.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Too much housekeeping and stuff tonight.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
We need to get into the thick of it with some gaming news.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
So, Loki, please start us off.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
So this week, well actually I should say,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
it hasn't come out yet, but they announced,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Sony has announced that a new firmware update

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
will be coming to the PS3 that's going to add Blu-ray Profile 2.0 support,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
which I think is better known as BD Live.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
And it will allow you to do different things with your movies,

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
including they'll have additional downloadable interactive content,

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
as well as like interactive games with leaderboards and that kind of stuff.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
All stuff that you can kind of throw together on a Blu-ray disc,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
which is pretty cool.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Some other cool stuff that they're enhancing,

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
you'll be able to play DivX in Windows Media files larger than two gigabytes.

23:51.000 --> 23:57.000
Also the music and photo playlist can be exported from the PS3 to the PSP.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
DVDs and Blu-rays will resume playback for the moment you last stopped them.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
The PSP can be used as a remote control to play music on the PS3.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
And the web browser will feature a faster page loading times

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
with the ability to save links and stream linked videos.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
That's pretty cool.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
And also I guess another thing they call mosquito noise reduction

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
will be added to AV control panel for Blu-rays and DVDs.

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
I don't know what the fuck that last part is, but I'm sure someone out there does.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I have no idea what that means either.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
What was that called? Mosquito?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Mosquito noise reduction.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
My guess may be like...

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Is that to like filter out the planes that fly by while you're watching the movies?

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
I don't know about that. Maybe like line humming or something like that.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
It removes like the hum off the line.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Interesting. Well, I thought Blu-ray was supposed to be like perfect anyway.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
What the hell is there doing line noise?

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
Your Blu-ray may be perfect, but your theater setup may not be perfect.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Ah, I see. Okay. All right.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
And my God, that sun is so fucking bright through that window.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I'm just like blinded by that.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
I'm sure the Just2TV people that are watching us on there can see,

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
but as we're taping, you know, just the way the sun is.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
I'm just fine.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
The sun is shining like right on Loki and I during the entirety of tonight's show.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I'm hiding in shadows.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Yes, we know Dark Soccer. We know.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
You know what? Why don't you just like duct tape a towel up there?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Nah, it's cool.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Loki's just re-situating.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
See, what will be funny is that then later the sun will move slowly and hit you in the eyes again.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Isn't it going that way?

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Well, like last week it kind of went down after a while.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It's shining through the last window right now anyway.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Constant exposure to your eyes will eventually give me a headache.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Yes.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
And I'm already starting to get one.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Maybe that's why I had a headache earlier. I don't know.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Stories.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
All right. Anyway, sorry.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
So the PlayStation 3 is not the only thing getting a firmware upgrade,

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
you know, for the whole Blu-ray 2.0 or whatever you want to call it.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
PSP just got a new firmware. It got the 3.93 firmware.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
It just rolled out recently.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
It's not a whole lot of new stuff.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
It's 20 brand new players in the internet radio feature, and that's really it.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Although I imagine it probably closed some loopholes in the hacking world,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
but my other question would be, has this already been hacked, Loki?

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
No, it hasn't because really all it did was add just those 20 stations,

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
so they have a workaround to add those 20 stations if you want,

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
but otherwise they're not worrying about cracking it because it's basically just that.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Oh.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
It seems a little silly to do a whole firmware upgrade just to add.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Those better be 20 damn good stations.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
20 damn good stations better be in there.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
We'll see.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
I don't know, does 3Speech have their own radio station? I'm sure.

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
No, I think all games where we're syndicated on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings,

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
I think they're on there, so that's all you really need, right?

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
We're not on there because Live 365 doesn't go on ShoutKastV,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
so we've been paying all that money. Why?

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Well, we can't even get listed on PSPs.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Oh, forget it. It's old hat now.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Things are going to be changing soon.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I have two words for that.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
Oh, AlphaKantagram says it's not stations, it's players.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
So I guess I'm what, like different skins and stuff?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Well, that's even lamer.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Yeah.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Tony players.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
RasteelUT says OLR should be on 3Speech Radio.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
That would be fun.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
Then we could talk about all the great things in the Sony world and nothing else.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Let's talk about all the good things in the Sony world.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And our show would be only five minutes long.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Hey, I have some great things in the Sony world to talk about.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
All right, then please do share.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
More like Sony being fucking stupid.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Ha ha.

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
No, basically EA put out a patch for the Orange Box on PS3

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
that's supposed to address these problems with connectivity and frame rate issues

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
and slow loading times, but they haven't put out any other documentation

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
to really say what else it's supposed to do.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
And the thing is like 128 meg.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
So it's kind of big.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
And no one else really knows what else it does.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
And the whole thing is it's not really Valve that did it.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
It's from their third party, so whatever.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
Well, at least it's not like, I was going to say like Bully got patched recently

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
and apparently the patch didn't do anything.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
See, Valve, this is what you get for having software on PlayStation 3.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
I don't know, RustyOUT in chat says the patch does nothing.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Well, he said what the patch did.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
It's just, I don't know.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
It's supposed to do.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Well, I am looking that up right now because I don't remember off the top of my head

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
because I don't own the PS3 version of the Orange Box.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
And you know me, I don't care about anybody but myself, so I don't know.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I don't have the PS3 version either.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I have the Xbox 360 version.

28:49.000 --> 28:55.000
And keep in mind, the only version worth having is either PC or Xbox 360.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
PlayStation 3 is, it's not meant to be online.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
Well, I mean, let's not get mad at them.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
I mean, who cares?

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
Okay, the PS3 version, they maybe didn't program it just quite right.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Well, we actually had a discussion on that earlier today

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
about which version of Bionic Commando we were going to get.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
And Dan was pretty much saying that even though it's going to be scaled back for resolution,

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
we're talking about getting the Xbox 360 version because there will be more people online to play with.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
I guess that's true.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And I don't know if they're going to actually scale it back resolution-wise.

29:28.000 --> 29:37.000
I mean, after all, they did allow them to break the barrier for Street Fighter 2 HD Turbo Remix,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
whatever the fuck it's called now.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
I think that that was the last announced thing, though, that they were having to scale it back

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
because the game wasn't quite working at the full resolution.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
I'm sure Microsoft will let them bend the rules a little bit to make it work with a big game like that.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Okay.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
Anyways, since we've wasted enough time, now I can tell you what was in that patch.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
They fixed graphical issues where a player would have the explosion effect

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
left on the end of their rocket launcher while attempting to rocket jump.

30:08.000 --> 30:15.000
Some memory leaks fixed an issue where the player's name would not appear on the stats comparison screen.

30:15.000 --> 30:22.000
There's an issue that would cause the vote tallies to disappear when you viewed a scoreboard between rounds.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Online server issue.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Let's see here.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
An issue with players not always being added to the player's menu and across media bar.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
Fixed a bug where a player viewing a friend without an EA account

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
would have an empty entry in their friend's leaderboard.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
Fixed an issue where it was not possible to connect to EA servers if you have more than 30 friends.

30:46.000 --> 30:52.000
Sounds like they fixed a lot of issues, but nothing really important like frame rate issues

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
or anything that really needed to be fixed.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Huh, unfortunate.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Speaking of Valve, you know what I checked out?

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
Finally, after all this time, and I know some of you guys are going to be like,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Oh my God, Rob, you're behind the times.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
I finally downloaded and checked out Steam this week after all this time.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
It's a nice little front-end program.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
It kind of reminds me of X-Fire, but with game purchases available inside it.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
And I actually thought about getting Portal just so I can have it on the computer

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
because I'm a sucker for that game as a lot of people are, what can I say?

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
So other cool stuff that's happening this week.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
I believe Famitsu Magazine, I want to say they were leaked out.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
I wouldn't really say leaked out, but they had Persona 4 covered in there.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
I guess it was their exclusive with a bonus DVD with a bunch of screenshots and movies

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
and all sorts of stuff from the new game.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
Apparently, Persona 4 is coming to Japan in July.

31:52.000 --> 31:58.000
Interesting enough, it's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 and not the PS3.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
So that's pretty cool.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
And it looks, to me, I think it looks a hundred times better than Persona 3.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
So I'm sure a lot of people will be very happy about that.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
No word of what's coming over to the U.S.,

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
but seeing as they've brought over Persona 3 and Persona 3 FES,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
it makes perfect sense that they would actually bring it over.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
Absolutely, and with Persona 3 getting the cult-ish style acclaim that it has over here,

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
I mean, Persona 3, definitely those that have played it have really enjoyed the game,

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
and I keep getting people telling me that I should play that game lots.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
I'm just surprised though, because the screenshots I saw, or at least the pictures,

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
I think a lot of that was from the full motion video in there, which is all anime.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
But it looked to me almost like a PlayStation 3 game,

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
but I guess it's PlayStation 2, which is, hey, awesome.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
That is pretty interesting that they're packing all that in a PlayStation 2 game,

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
you know what I mean?

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
That they're still cranking them out for the quote-unquote old system,

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
but, you know, I guess still tons and tons of PS2s out there,

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
it's still one of the better selling game systems, eh?

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Why not?

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I guess it makes sense.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Well, another game that folks are looking forward to,

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
not just on the PlayStation 3, but on the Xbox 360, is Street Fighter IV,

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
and it seems like little bits and pieces of Street Fighter IV news

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
come out every week to keep this game on the blog radar and on places like our show,

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
and it works brilliantly, because, you know,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
there's some interesting news this week that has been announced,

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
and that is that it has some more in common with Street Fighter II.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
This game is starting to sound more and more like just another like Street Fighter II port,

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
but just like completely new graphics and everything.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
Really? Just like Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
Well, but yet, you know, it's got the whole, it's 3D-ish element,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
and, you know, the whole new characters and all that,

33:51.000 --> 33:59.000
so, you know, the fighter guy and the, what was her name, Crimson Viper, whatever her name was,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
so there's some, I think it'll be very cool,

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
but the news that was announced this week is that not only are there some small,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
you know, cosmetic changes in the game and da-da-da,

34:09.000 --> 34:15.000
but that the old combos will work exactly the same way in the new game,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
and that means the old combos from Street Fighter II.

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
So, and if you use, like, if you got, you know, a Guile combo down that you used to use in Street Fighter II,

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
apparently you can use them in Street Fighter IV as well.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Interesting.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
Obviously, I'm assuming it doesn't end there, and you can, there's all sorts of new combos and things as well,

34:34.000 --> 34:41.000
but kind of interesting that those folks that were, you know, experts at Street Fighter II will be a leg up already on Street Fighter IV.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Awesome. All the more reason for me not to play this game. Why?

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
It was in the arcade.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
Makes me long for, uh, Co-Co-Co-Combo Breaker.

34:51.000 --> 34:45.280
Dude, I love Killer

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
But that's just, have you ever played against, though, one of those people who are just, like, the combo people?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
It's painful.

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
You know, strangely enough, not so much in Street Fighter II, but in Mortal Kombat, I used to get those people all the time, and it used to piss me off.

35:08.000 --> 35:14.000
I was one of those people on the beta version, though, just because I learned the Kitana's Infinite combo.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
Which was funny, because people get mad. Anyway, speaking of pain...

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
I gotta say this real quick in chat, Rob D. says, uh, there's no way they could get away with skipping those combos.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
This is nothing new. They never change mechanics that much.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
True, but when you consider the age of Street Fighter II, you know what I mean?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
It's kinda, kinda cool.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Can I get on with the pain?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
You may. Bring on the pain.

35:35.000 --> 35:45.000
Well, pain is gonna be on Playstation Network, at least for the PAL PSN, for 4.99 pounds.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
Basically, it's a game where you throw stuff for points.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
I can't really describe it much else than that.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Didn't you buy pain?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
No.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
I thought you did.

35:56.000 --> 36:02.000
I have not bought anything. Well, other than Flow, I bought that on there.

36:02.000 --> 36:08.000
But other than that, I have not bought a game on the PSN, because I do not like their payment method.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
It's like jackass in the game.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I don't like using real money. I like points.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Sorry, Jamie.

36:13.000 --> 36:23.000
Basically, the whole point of pain is that, you know, you're causing misfortune in people, and people grow up and laugh at them.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
They get laughed at, so basically that's sort of what pain is about.

36:28.000 --> 36:38.000
Anyway, to get back to the story, there are also additional packs that are 69 pence each,

36:38.000 --> 36:48.000
and it will be the Scurvedog, Muffy, Santa, Hunglo, Ginger, Cookie, and Fun with Explosives packs.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
The last one is supposed to be a freebie.

36:50.000 --> 36:56.000
You know, but any game that combines Santa and Fun with Explosives, you think would be Instant Win, so I don't know.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
If I had a band, it would be named Fun with Explosives.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
Really?

37:03.000 --> 37:10.000
But also, the store also has the Shranglehold pack for $9.99.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
That's, again, in pounds.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
That has multiplayer maps.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
It actually should be the one that they got on Xbox Live.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
You should see if that name is taken in Rock Band.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Fun with Explosives.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
Well, if not, then I would be stealing the one from clerks that Dan came up with this morning.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
What's that?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Making Fuck.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
It's probably taken.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
I wouldn't doubt it.

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
I think I have the name Emergency Kittens, but there's no one in the band, so whatever.

37:40.000 --> 37:48.000
Anyhow, let's move on to some release dates for other things coming out around the world in the regular stores, the big box stores.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Yes.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
This week, we've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
Of course, winding down a little bit until we get to Mario Kart and Grand Theft Auto.

37:58.000 --> 38:05.000
But in the US, we've got Dark Sector coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

38:05.000 --> 38:13.000
Also this week, Viking Battle for Asgard, that's also coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
Just a little game here on the PSP, Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
That'll be coming out as well this week.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
Probably one of the biggest releases on the PSP for a while at least.

38:27.000 --> 38:38.000
Also this week, we've got Opuna on the Wii, that's that Koei RPG that you can actually control the entire game with the nunchuck only.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
I'm actually very curious to check out Opuna.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I definitely want to check out that game.

38:43.000 --> 38:52.000
There's a little budget puzzle game called Octomania, $19.99 for this game, and you can play it online with other people.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
So that's not bad at all.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
Also this week, Naruto the Ultimate Ninja 3 on PlayStation 2.

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
Obscure the Aftermath on PlayStation 2 and the Wii.

39:04.000 --> 39:11.000
Let's see here, a really crappy game called Backyard Baseball 2009 for the DS.

39:11.000 --> 39:25.000
I don't know what number release this is this year, but one of the billion releases for Harvest Moon this year with Harvest Moon DS Cute.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
That's going to be coming out on the DS.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword also on the DS.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
That'll be fun too.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
Does Ninja Gaiden still have the epic cinema scenes like the old school games have?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
I'm not sure.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
God, I hope so on the DS.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
But the whole game is controlled with the stylus, so that's pretty cool.

39:45.000 --> 39:53.000
And let's see here, we've also got some more crap here.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
I guess, oh, this is also coming out on the 31st.

39:57.000 --> 40:04.000
Monokhemia Alchemist of Alrivis, and that is a new RPG by Koei as well.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
And that's pretty much it.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Yeah, for right now.

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
And I know next week there's absolutely shit coming out, so enjoy it while you laugh.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
Alrighty, well let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases that will be coming out in Japan very soon.

40:20.000 --> 40:31.000
On the Xbox 360, you get Dark Sector comes out, as well as Raiden Fighters Aces and Tomb Raider Anniversary all come out in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.

40:31.000 --> 40:38.000
Also, a DVD lens cleaner, if you needed one of those for your Xbox 360.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
On the PlayStation 3, also a DVD lens cleaner.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Imagine that.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Hori's cranking out the DVD cleaning.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
I guess folks are getting their PlayStations and Xboxes dirty over there.

40:51.000 --> 40:58.000
Also, Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga, and after all this time, Japan, I know you've really been waiting for this on PlayStation 3,

40:58.000 --> 41:08.000
The Golden Compass finally gets its port on the PlayStation 3 over in Japan, or as they call it, Lira Nobuken.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
That's the name of it.

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
Coming out on other systems on the Nintendo Wii, Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga also on the Nintendo Wii.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
Ninja Reflex Nitro Bike makes its way out of there.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Here's a spoiler for Japan, Nitro Bike sucks.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
And how do you know that?

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Because I played it, and it sucks.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
What sucks about it?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
You can't say a game sucks without telling us what sucks about it.

41:30.000 --> 41:36.000
The game sucks, the graphics are horrible, the polygons and textures are low-res, the game controls like crap,

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
and it's trying to be Excite Truck, except it's nowhere near Excite Truck.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
I got it for Nelly because I thought, hey, this looks like an Excite Truck.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
It's got rockets and everything, and it's created by the people at the Excite Bike 64.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
What could be bad about it?

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
Well, apparently a lot, so that's why it sucks.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
GS68, by the way, refers to one of the earlier titles we mentioned in the chat.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
He says, Golden Cump Ass, get it?

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Golden Cump Ass.

42:05.000 --> 42:12.000
PlayStation 2 sees Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus comes out,

42:12.000 --> 42:19.000
as well as Neo Angelique Full Voice in a premium box and a super premium box,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
as well as the original comes out.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
Silent Hill Origins makes its way to some Asian regions this week,

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
but Korea's the only one we see mentioned, so be sure to check.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
It might be a little bit longer before it makes its way to Japan.

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
Nobunaga no Yabu Online comes out in Japan this week as well.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Lots of fun stuff.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Let's see real quickly what's coming out on the handheld systems.

42:43.000 --> 42:49.000
On the Nintendo DS, we have Business Ryokukente DS comes out.

42:49.000 --> 42:59.000
Katakushi Hitman Reborn, Bongoshiki Taisen Battle Sugoruku comes out.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Baseball game.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
I like that it says Hitman Reborn in it in the middle of it, though.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
Kind of makes me think of a different type of game.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Maybe it's baseball with Hitman. That would be fun.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
No.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
They need Battlefield Baseball. That would be pretty awesome.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
Let's see, Simple DS series gets volume 35, the Genshin this week.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
Lost in Blue 2 gets a price reduction, and Mobile Suit Gundam 00 comes out.

43:24.000 --> 43:31.000
Mina de Flash Anzen DS, Mina no Atsumare Quiz Party comes out,

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
and wait for it, the Golden Compass on Nintendo DS.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
PSP, check in real quick to see if anything's coming out of note there.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G, that might be kind of cool,

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
as well as Tomb Raider Anniversary comes out on the Sony PSP.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
That's it for Japan.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
That's all.

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000
Okay, well, I have for our UK listeners another set of release dates.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
We have on the 27th, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
You've heard us talk about this, so don't worry about it.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
The Golden Horde on PC.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
On the 28th, we have Coded Arms Contagion, Football Manager 2008,

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
God of War Chains of Olympus, King of Clubs,

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution,

44:19.000 --> 44:24.000
Powershot Pinball Constructor, which sounds pretty fun, that's on DS,

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on Wii, Sega Bass Fishing,

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
Universe at War Earth Assault, Viking Battle for Asgard,

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
Warriors of the Lost Empire, Warriors Orochi on PC and PSP,

44:38.000 --> 44:43.000
and Worms Space Oddity.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
That would be it.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
Coming out here not very soon, but soon enough,

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
in June, Activision actually announced that they will be bringing

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
Guitar Hero on tour to the Nintendo DS.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
Now, you may be wondering, how the hell are they going to do that?

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
Well, there's actually a brand new peripheral that they're releasing along with it,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
called the Guitar Grip.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
It has four fret buttons and a wonderful little hand strap to put your hand through.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
So, you use that just like you would, you know, the fret buttons on an actual guitar,

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
and then you strum on the touchscreen with a stylus,

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
or actually a pick stylus that comes with the game to do that kind of stuff.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
And, of course, you know, plays just like Guitar Hero.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
It's supposed to have 20 songs, or more than 20 songs in the game,

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
and 80% of the songs will be original master recordings.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
So, that's pretty cool.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
If my memory serves me right, it's $49.99, comes out June 22nd.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
Oh, just in time for my birthday!

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
By the way, they've wasted no time in whoring this game to the masses.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
I don't know if you guys ever visit yahoo.com, like just, you know, out of the blue,

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
but it's one of the pages I'll go to, you know, for, like, news and search and stuff.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
And there's a little flash ad that pops right up there.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
It's already whoring the Guitar Hero on tour.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Oh, yeah.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
They're wasting no time.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
And I would recommend pre-ordering this if you're really interested in it,

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
because, like most other Activision games that include peripherals,

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
especially brand new peripherals that they're breaking ground on,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
this thing will be hard to find.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
Frisbee asks, is anyone honestly going to buy this crap?

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I actually have mine pre-ordered already.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
I'm considering it.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
But I'm not going to probably play it, because that's what I do.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
It looks interesting.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I'm interested enough where I at least want to play it.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I don't know if I want to drop, what, you said $49.95?

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
$49.99.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
I don't know if I want to drop $50 on it, especially if it's only 20 songs.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
But I'm interested in, like, checking it out.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
I don't know. I think it's neat.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
I don't think it would be that difficult if it's only four buttons

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
if I can already play five button mode on the, uh...

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Dude, Konami really missed out, man.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
They could have done Guitar Freeze with three buttons.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
Mm, I've been saying that for a long time. Just saying.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
All right.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Well, I'm interested. Actually, I'm interested.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Let me ask chat.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
How many folks in chat are interested in picking this game up,

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Guitar Hero on tour?

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Quick, quick poll of chat,

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
because I imagine most of you that own DSes or, you know,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
or if you don't own a DS, imagine you did.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Would you pick up this game?

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
And Frisbee says, please just smack yourself.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Elite Beat Agents.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Okay, thanks.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Oh, I feel so sorry for Elite Beat Agents.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
I was in Fry's the other day, and that game's, like, on clearance.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Yeah.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Tons and tons of copies.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
You can't buy it anymore, actually. It's kind of sad.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
So sad. That game is awesome.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
But, you know, hey, and here's the thing,

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
and I don't know if you should start getting worried about this or not,

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
but they're really whoring Guitar Hero out.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
I mean, Activision, I don't know if they're going to drive it into the ground or what,

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
but, I mean, we've got, actually, literally a week after this,

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith coming out.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Then you've got Guitar Hero 4,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
and who knows how many other shit, you know,

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
games that they're going to throw in the middle there.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
They're really whoring that franchise out,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
and, I mean, and people are kind of really buying into it, unfortunately.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Alright, let's look at our instant poll results in Chat Room.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
I'm not going to read the nickname since that'll take me too long,

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
but really quickly, here's some of the comments.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
Question was, are you going to buy Guitar Hero on Tour DS?

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
I'm not. Zero percent. No. No. Not me.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
Just get a PSP and DJ Max.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
Depends on the song list. Maybe.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
Only for the peripheral to make it easier to play Puzzle League.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Strap for the win.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.000
If the game has songs I like, I might download, I mean, pick it up.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
I may get it if they guarantee cheap expansion pack song cards minus peripheral.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
Never ever ever ever.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
I will purchase Guitar Hero on Tour after I'm done burning $100 bills.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
No. Nope. You'd look like a damn fool playing it.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
No. No. Not ripped off.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
And, Con.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
There's your instant poll results.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
Well, I was just thinking, I mean, this is a good game for kids,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
especially when you're taking them on the road and stuff.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
They can play their Guitar Hero with headphones on in the car

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
and not bug Mommy and Daddy while they're driving to Grandma's house.

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
Yeah, I think, again, the soccer moms are going to make or break this game.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Really, I think is what it's going to be.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I think you're absolutely right.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
It's a great game to just give to your kids.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Give your kids some headphones in the game,

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
and look, you can play Guitar Hero in the car. Have fun.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
Shut up.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Really, the only reason I'm buying it is so we can show it on the show.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
That's pretty much the only reason.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Oh, don't waste your money.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
Well, hey, just because I ordered it doesn't mean I'm going to actually buy it, okay?

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Because I don't have to.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
I just put it on order to kind of hold my spot.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
RosteelUT says,

49:42.000 --> 49:48.000
Loki, you're high. They'll bug Mommy even more with this game by singing along.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
No, maybe my wife would do that, but, you know.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Just don't put songs with words in them. There you go.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
All right.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
It's your mental only.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
Let's go into more lawsuit news from Gibson.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
We already kind of talked about this last week,

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
but if you can believe it, even more lawsuits coming out from Gibson.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
You remember Gibson sued Activision.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
They sued Harmonix last week, all over the fact that Gibson says

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
they have had a patent for electronic guitars for quite some time.

50:19.000 --> 50:26.000
And get this, this week, now they've sued GameStop, Walmart, Target, Kmart, Amazon, Toys R Us,

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
all these major retailers that sell Guitar Hero games,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
seeking basically to stop the sale of the games.

50:32.000 --> 50:38.000
Did you see they also sued EA, even though EA doesn't make Guitar Hero at all?

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
It's crazy, yeah.

50:40.000 --> 50:48.000
I was going to say, in the next piece here, they sued Harmonix, Viacom, and EA now as well.

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
Just because, I guess, they want to sue as many people as possible.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I don't understand this. This makes no sense at all.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
I don't know. They're looking for money.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
But why would you sue the retailers to get them to try to stop selling the game?

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
Because they're trying to make a big stink.

51:05.000 --> 51:10.000
They're trying to make a big stink and seeing who will give them money.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
Loki says the EA suit is over Rock Band.

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
I don't know if it's over Rock Band, because they mention Guitar Hero in the lawsuit.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
It's not Rock Band.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Is it because now Harmonix is a part of...

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Oh no, I guess it was just an agreement. I don't know.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
That just sucks. Let's sue everything.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
I like that comment from Gerardimo in chat.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
Well, you've got to wonder, is this Gibson thing legitimate or not?

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
There's actually an analyst out there.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Of course, we love analysts.

51:38.000 --> 51:43.000
This is actually a legal analyst working for Wedbush Morgan.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
He's an analyst.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
He says this about the lawsuits.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Michael Pastors' name.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
This is a poorly masked attempt to extort money.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
They are using any way they can to have Activision write them a check.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Seriously, this is the third game.

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
Well, the third major release of the game that's been out so far.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
I think at one time they had Gibson guitars in the game, I want to say.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I don't know. I may be wrong.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
How could they not be aware that they're violating the patent?

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
I mean, oh, wait a second.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
This is a guitar game? How retarded are they?

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
I would say the fact that the Gibson guitars were in the game should negate the whole damn thing,

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
because they've known this that long, and they made that agreement.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Now they're absolutely after burning themselves.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
And if we want to really draw straws,

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
they weren't the first ones to come up with the whole guitar game thing anyways.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
It was Konami, and if I remember correctly,

52:39.000 --> 52:44.000
I thought Activision was licensing the rights to use that from Konami,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
and not Gibson.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
They're just...

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
All I gotta say is the next fucking guitar games you guys put out,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
just forget about Gibson.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
There's plenty of other guitar manufacturers out there you can license guitars for.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
Well, anyhow, this news I know makes me angsty every time I hear about this,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
and I'm sure you guys feel the same way.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
So you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

53:14.000 --> 53:30.000
...

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Well, I guess Fly 365 goes without saying,

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
so I'm not gonna really go too much in depth on that.

53:38.000 --> 53:45.000
But FU2 having way too many people in the house

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
when I had a doffy to work on,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I suddenly got her blushed,

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
and I haven't finished with the rest of the face.

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
FU2 basically being kind of middle income,

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
because we make too much money to be able to afford some of these low-income,

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
first-time buyer loan programs,

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
but we don't make enough to really afford a decent house.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
So people who actually make less than us can afford a nicer house.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I don't know. That fucking sucks.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
FU2 Live 365 goes without saying.

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
In fact, I think when this show comes back in a non-Live 365 place,

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
we should actually probably rename this segment to the Live 365 Memorial FUs of the Week.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
That might be fun.

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
Also, I want to give an FU2 the CAT scan I had on Thursday.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
It was so miserable.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
Look, I still have a bruise from where they gave me the little shot thingy,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
or the iodine thing.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I was so miserable.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I reacted so bad to it.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Yeah, I had to have a CAT scan,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
because I'm still having those pains that I've been having,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
and they're not going away, which sucks.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
And I don't get the results back till Monday,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
so FU2 waiting.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
That sucks.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
It does suck.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
I'll tell you what, though.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
This is the best diet I've ever been on.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I'll eat a couple things, and I get extremely full.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
It's like I had gastric bypass or something,

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
without having to pay for it.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
It's great.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
All right, that does it for the FUs of the Week.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Let's get back to some gaming news.

55:17.000 --> 55:23.000
Wow, we have almost a whole segment of music game news, don't we, Jamie?

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Yeah, how's that?

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Right before they're screwing us over.

55:28.000 --> 55:37.000
Anyway, MTV has said that they've sold more than 6 million, I think,

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
songs in Rock Band as downloadable content.

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
So now Harmonics is bringing in the Rock Band music store

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

55:47.000 --> 55:55.000
so that you can actually download your songs in-game without leaving the game.

55:55.000 --> 56:04.000
And so you can sort them by artist, genre, album, title, pack, and other ways, too.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
There's album art.

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
You can listen to song previews and difficulty levels.

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
And the patch is actually supposed to be out this week.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Or maybe it's already out.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Yeah, the patch is already out.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Didn't you say that you...

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
I did, and it's lots of fun.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Sorry, I just... he's eating toast.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
I know.

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
I give that F.U. to not being able to eat, and then I'm eating.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Excuse me, sorry.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
So yeah, I did download the music store,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
and it's actually kind of cool because you get the little album art,

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
and then you can download the song previews now.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
So if you're not sure exactly what a song is,

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I think I've heard that song, but I'm not sure.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
You can download the little song previews, and it stays on there.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
So when you're scrolling in the list in the future, you can kind of hear it,

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
like it was DDR or something.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
Especially the music store kind of looks like a DDR selection screen to me.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
I don't know.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
I like the fact that you can actually preview the songs,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
something that I thought should have been on there in the first place

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
instead of having to buy these songs blindly

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
unless you have a YouTube link where you can watch the video

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
or listen to the song.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
I think that's smart.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
I think the whole thing was smart because I realized there were songs in there

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
I wanted that I didn't realize I didn't have.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Yeah, because it's hard sometimes,

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
especially when you recognize a song on the radio by the song,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
not necessarily by the title,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
or you might not even know who the artist is.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
You just recognize the song.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Press Start in Chat agrees with us.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
The previews in Rock Band are evil.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
I downloaded like three more songs because of them.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
There you have it.

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
Well, there was a little bit more that I saw about them trying to add more features

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
that were based off of requests by the community, so that's pretty cool.

57:44.000 --> 57:50.000
It's supposed to be new content every week through 2008, so that's pretty cool.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
That's, of course, only in the U.S. right now.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
That's pretty cool.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
You know what I'm surprised they don't have yet is vision camera support

58:03.000 --> 58:09.000
or camera support to basically film yourself doing your little rock concert shit

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
in front of your TV or whatever with your friends

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
and then posting it like a YouTube thing

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
with some sort of contest maybe lumped in with that,

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
although at the same time I'm kind of glad they don't have that

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
because that would be a motivation for some other people

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
to try to get me to do things I don't want to do.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Let's see here.

58:31.000 --> 58:37.000
This week we've got a new download pack coming to Rock Band.

58:37.000 --> 58:45.000
It's actually six songs from Boston and quite a few that you'll probably like here,

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
including, let's see here,

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
Hitch a Ride, More Than a Feelin',

58:52.000 --> 58:58.000
Peace of Mind, Rock and Roll Band, Smokin' and Something About You.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
So that's pretty cool.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
And you can buy that in a pack for 800 Microsoft points or $10

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
or individually for 160 Microsoft points or $1.99 each.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
So you save $2 if you buy it all.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
Whatever happened to you getting that Rock Band stage kit?

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
When is it not out yet?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
When does that come out?

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
June.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
June?

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Yeah.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
We're going to have to wait that long to rock

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
and we won't even be able to do it on Live 365?

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
That sucks.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Is that right?

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
It's one of those things that we need to have a camera for

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
so we can see the entire garage being filled with smoke.

59:38.000 --> 59:46.000
Here's a little clip of Boston if you actually need a reminder.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
It's the same song that's in Guitar Hero.

59:49.000 --> 59:57.000
And I think it's also in Cariote Revolution.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Boston is great.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Boston is pretty awesome.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I'm telling you though, I want my Queen pack, my Journey pack.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Where's my Journey pack?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I need me some Queen because that'd be awesome.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
The Queen pack would be epic.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And also, you know what else we need?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
We need some really kick-ass hardcore industrial stuff.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Get some bands that aren't around anymore, like Gravity Kills.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
That should be awesome.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
How about Tracy Lords?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
That'd be awesome too.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I love Tracy Lords.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
She apparently sucks live.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I'm sure she does.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
She sucks on tape too.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
She was funny in Crusty Baby.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Oh yeah, I love Tracy Lords as an actress.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Good stuff, wasn't she?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Well yes, she was on the NBC show.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Was it The Pretenders for the longest time?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I thought you were talking about it before.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
No, I'm not that type of actress.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Although, sure, people everywhere can appreciate her fine work there.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Something else you folks can appreciate is Free Stuff.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Who doesn't like Free Stuff?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
We don't if it's Yaris.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Well, this isn't Yaris.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
It's actually on the Nintendo Wii.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
It's sort of a, we're sorry, please forgive us type of thing.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Remember how the whole Wii Guitar Hero 3 on the Nintendo Wii only had the mono sound in it?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And they have to do all these replacement discs for the stereo sound now?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Well, you're also going to be getting a Guitar Hero face plate.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
A free Guitar Hero face plate.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
It's actually kind of neat looking.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It looks like fire a little bit.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It's red and yellow and black and it looks like a phoenix kind of rising up from this fire-ish looking thing.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
So, it's kind of cool.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And it's small black leather and it says, please don't sue us.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Please don't sue us.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Please no class action laws here.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
By accepting this face plate, you agree not to do a class action law show?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I don't know, Jamie, don't you think that looks kind of cool?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
It looks better than the guitar I have in the living room.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Listen, I hate how the Wii mote goes in the guitar like that.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
It's so weird.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
But I guess it makes sense and probably makes things cost less.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But anyway, free face plate for those of you that are going to be getting the replacement discs for Guitar Hero on the Wii.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I understand. It hijacks Wi-Fi like a college student in an apartment complex.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Can we please move on with the gaming news at this time?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Sure, why not?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000
At least, you know, I would be more than happy to if my computer would decide that it would let me pull up the stupid file.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Sorry.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
There we go.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Got none at the time?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It's all you.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Anyway, especially know that there's quite a few really hardcore fans out there who are probably listening.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I can think of one in particular.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:08.000
They're actually saying that there may be another version, another song pack for Guitar Hero that would be all Beatles stuff.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And that's pretty cool, although I've been corrected as far as information in the article that their catalog cannot be distributed on iTunes because of a lawsuit going on between Apple and Apple Corp.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
So I'm not going to go into all that.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Read Wikipedia.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:40.000
But they said that they're trying to work about bringing a few songs out for a particular song pack, so I think that would be kind of cool.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Don't they have to get the rights back from Michael Jackson, or did he sell that stuff when he started becoming poor?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I'm not the expert.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Well, another bad idea sounds like something coming from Ubisoft with their brand new title in their Imagine series. Imagine, people actually buy this shit.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Imagine Rockstar.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
It is absolutely in no way a ripoff of Rockband, I'm sure.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And it kind of revolves around fashion and stuff.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:23.000
The Imagine series is meant for girls aged 6 to 14, or in the case of Jamie, she likes Imagine Babies.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And it will allow little girls, I guess, to be able to play drums, guitar, bass, and piano with each other via Wi-Fi.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And each instrument has its own unique control using the DS stylus, and players will be able to customize the look of each bandmate and create the most stylish rockers.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Only girls can play? That's not fair.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Fine, you too can play.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Yay!

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And they work their way up the charts to become the number one recording band.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
How is that different from Rockband?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Don't you get to dress your characters in Rockband?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
You have to understand, this is shitty Rockband, not so crappy.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But if that's not for you, there's also, of course, the rest of the Imagine series, including Imagine Figure Skater, Imagine Fashion Designer, Imagine Animal Doctor, Imagine Master Chef, and Imagine Babies.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Imagine Master Chef.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Yeah, it's funny, if you read the Master Chef really fast, it's almost like Imagine Master Chief, and that's like, hey, wait a second.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I wonder if we could get the Imagine people on the show.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I mean, why not?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Let's hear them, I don't want to say defend themselves, but let's hear about their contributions to the gaming scene.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I make fun of them because it's not my demographic, but you know what, there is a problem with a lot of games not being focused towards girls, and so they are kind of working that market.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Same with UFO Interactive, they make a lot of these, was it Smart Boys Game Room, Smart Girls Dream House type thing like that, it's games that are aimed at kids that are three years old, like really get you hooked young.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Start them young.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Exactly, so it's nice that they're aiming for this demographic, obviously though it's easy fodder for us in the press to just kind of make fun of it because we don't understand it, and it's different.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Back in my day, we had Mario is Missing, and we liked it.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Mario is Missing was great, and besides that, I personally, for some of these, I don't really feel like perpetuating any type of stereotypical behavior or traditional roles, I think that it's up to...

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:54.000
It's just like when Nintendo tried Super Princess Peach, and that flopped, and so they said, fuck it, boys will play games, girls will do nothing.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I play games...

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I like Super Princess Peach, screw you.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I like shooting things in games, it's like...

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
You will play your Kirby and your Peach games and you will like them, that's it.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
No...

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And now the chat room is just going off with all these different imagined things, but Amaze Hetsuma, I like this one, says, imagine these games in a landfill next to E.T.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I like violent games.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Frisbee says, Peach is awesome in Brawl, that's actually true, like the two characters I use most are Pit and Peach.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I don't like the fruit fruit games.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It's like the Peach Pit.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Get it? What?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I don't like fruit fruit games, why do you think I have to play fruit fruit games?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Cause it's funny.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I want Explosive Portal.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
That's the joke.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
No it's not.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Do you like Final Fantasy Tactics?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
No.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Well then this is not for you, Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is coming out on the Nintendo DS, and there are some folks that are big fans of Final Fantasy Tactics.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I like Final Fantasy Tactics, like the old one on the Playstation 1, I kind of lost the series since then, but this is definitely worth checking out as Final Fantasy Tactics A2, and it will be coming out June 24th is when this game is coming out.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Apparently this game has to do with the Ivalice Alliance, it's related a little more to the Final Fantasy XII series.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
A little bit I guess.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Check that out loosely.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Another way to whore that series even more.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Stop whoring your Final Fantasy series.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Final Fantasy XII was a good game.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Make one game, move to the next number.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
You do not need to expand upon this series in tax-dick games.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
And besides, I mean, I don't know, Revenant Wings, did you play much of that?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Not really.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Yeah, okay.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Cool, you can be the killer tomato in this game, or at least I think you fight the killer tomato, that's kind of cool.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
This game actually looks kind of rad.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I still need to beat Final Fantasy XII, though, and that other Final Fantasy game you bought me on DS, Loki.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Looks like fun.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I'm sure we'll be hearing from our listeners on this game.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Well, we hear from them about everything else.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I mean, hi!

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:09.000
No, we know Codemasters, right?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
We're familiar with them.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Sure.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Codemasters Online Gaming basically said that they want to do two MMOs for home consoles.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
They were saying that they've had a little bit of success already in the market,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
and so they're looking to bring stuff out for PlayStation 3.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
This is one of the ones listed, and they're saying that now is the right time to hop on it.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So there's not anything specific yet, but they said that they're really going to gear it for the consoles.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000
So I personally don't think MMOs work very well on consoles unless it's like, you know, PSO.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Here's what I'm hoping, and I know that they don't make this game, at least not Codemasters.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000
APB, that game that's coming out that's just like Saints Row, but it's an MMO.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I hope to God that I don't have to pay month to month for that thing, because I really want to play it, like badly.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Well, most MMOs you do have to pay month to month for.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Yeah, but Guild Wars is out, and they really need to follow that line of thought there.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Everybody, look at Guild Wars. Look at it.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And there's a lot of games out there that are free to play, and you know, you buy download content.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
That's what they should do, just give out free games, and then I'll pay for download content later on.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Like Second Life?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
No, Second Life is stupid. That's like if I wanted to go pick up virtual horror.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
It is free, and you get what you pay for.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And you pay for your downloadable content.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Yes, but that's a game where you...

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
You just described Second Life.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Okay, but Second Life is a bad example, because that game sucks.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And it's not really a game, it's just an addiction. It's like the MySpace of MMOs, okay?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But it does specifically do what you were suggesting.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Okay, it does, but it sucks at it.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So, what I'm trying to say though, there's like other games out there that are also free to play,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000
and most of them are Korean, because apparently they understand how to make a good MMO.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Or apparently Malaysian, like one of my friends is on...

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Yeah, go figure. Malaysia, you know, where a lot of piracy used to come out of,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
and yet they're making good games that are free.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I don't know. That's kind of weird.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
But I digress, so...

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
There's kind of a little bit of a different topic here,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
but once again, and we haven't heard about this in a while,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Massachusetts now is considering the whole games as porn bill.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Apparently it's House Bill 1423, being dubbed of course as the games as porn bill,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
would use the rationale to prevent minors from buying violent games,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
because they're treating it the same as porn.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I don't understand this, because porn is way better than games.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Exactly.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Come on.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And the bill was drafted by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
which if he's up for re-election, remember that when you're voting.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And with the assistance from, of course,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
well this right here is why the bill is bad in the first place,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Voldemort was the inspiration on that bill.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And of course, legislative sponsor,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Republican Linda, or I'm sorry,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Representative Linda Dorsina Forey,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
who happens to be a Democrat.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And of course, this thing,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
much like all the other ones in the past,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
will fail because it's not constitutional.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
But at the same time,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000
what do we got to do to stop these people from wasting our tax dollars

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
on these bills that they know they're going to fail?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
You know, it's like the fucking...

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Is it so that when they re-run for office,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
they can say like, hey, I took a stand against this.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Yeah, it's really...

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Video games are poisoning your children,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and I take a stand against this.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
My name is Rob, and I approve this message.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Well, great.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So it's really for their own personal gain,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
and it's still wasting taxpayers' money.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
All the more reason you should hate it.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I don't know.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Do our children really need to be protected from games?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I mean, do we really need the government to step in

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
to tell our children what's okay to play?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I mean, are we that retarded?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I know some people are that retarded,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
but I would like to think that, you know,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
most of us are not that retarded.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Because if we're all that retarded,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
then who the hell are we going to elect in as president?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Hey, I promise you shiny things.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Okay, you got my vote.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I don't know.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Alrighty.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Well, we'll see...

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I'm sure we'll hear about this game later when it fails.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Meanwhile...

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Or the bill, not the game.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Meanwhile, we're going to get to the end of part A of our show here,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
but not before we pay a little respect to our elders in this segment.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
We always do every single week here on the program.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It's Dark Sockra's classic video game of the week.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
So Dark Sockra, you've dug through the archives,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
you've verified this pick is not a duplicate per the wiki.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
What classic game should the kids be checking out this week?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Jackal!

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Jackal is a great game because you drive tanks and blow up shit.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Best game ever.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
And yes, I'm talking about the Nintendo version specifically.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
This is when the music is cool.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
How is that?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
I used to play this game.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
It's like Akari Warriors, but you're in a jeep.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Yeah, this is the game that makes me think of that line from Hot Shots.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
War is fantastic.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
But no, which I don't really believe.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
But anyway, I love Jackal just because...

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Okay, I actually have memories of this game before my papa, who is my dad's dad.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Before he died, we would actually sit in front of the big screen TV.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
And we're talking like, you know, early 90's style big screen.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
So this was a big deal.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Playing the Nintendo and playing Jackal with papa, that was great.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
But the game actually, it was an arcade released in Japan.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It was called Tokusho Butai Jackaru, which would be Jackal.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Special Forces Unit Jackal, which was released in the US as Top Gunner.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Basically, the whole point of the game is you go through and you can run over...

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Well, I like to run them over, but you can shoot down enemy soldiers wandering around.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And you rescue POWs and you have to actually take them to the extraction point where a helicopter will run off with them.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:03.000
And then you fight like whatever your boss is at the end of the level.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:11.000
But again, it came out over here in the arcade as Top Gunner, but it did come out as Jackal on the Nintendo.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Also though, for anyone who happened to be one of those few people who has a Famicom Disk System,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:32.000
it was brought out as Final Commando Akaiyousai, which basically is Final Command The Red Fortress.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:39.000
The game is just really fun. On top of that, when you play two player, it does force you to cooperate.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Because it gets to a point where if one person is going one way, it won't let your other person advance.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
And sometimes one person can draw fire while the other person goes in and does something else.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It's really a unique one for the whole Run and Gun series.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You can actually blow up different areas in the game where there's hidden stuff.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.000
You can get extra power-ups, you can get rocket launchers, or you can get...

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I actually preferred to keep the grenades because the grenades would go over a wall, whereas rockets just sort of explode on the wall.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It was really cool.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I like how you pick up the little dudes. I didn't play this game a whole lot. I think I remember playing it once and I just wasn't that into it when I was younger.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:36.000
But I like how you pick up the little dudes in the houses and drop them off at the plane. It's like a rescue mission thing. It's cool.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:49.000
You can, though, keep upgrading your missiles to where you get your missile launcher, you get one with a higher range, you get one that produces shrapnel, and an area damage missile that shoots out from left and right.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I still preferred the grenades because they went over the walls.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:01.000
You can also control which direction you fire in, which was pretty cool. You can turn and fire forward in a different way.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I mean, it's like a tank. So, it was really cool. It's one of my favorite ever games. On top of that, I actually have really good memories of the game, so it was kind of cool.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And also, there was a bootleg version of Top Gunner that would let you use the Ikari Warriors-style control. That was pretty cool.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:37.000
It had a version on the IBM PC in 1988, like I said, the Famicom Disk System, and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Or the inevitable Xbox Live Arcade port at some point, probably.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Could you imagine this Hi-Rez?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
That would be pretty awesome.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Sweet.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:55.000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Jackal, in this case on the NES, but on a variety of systems, as DarkSakura pointed out. Check it out.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000
All right, and that's our cue to take a quick break, so that's exactly what we're going to do.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.000
We're going to take a break, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Tune to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
