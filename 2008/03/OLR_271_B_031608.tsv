15300	19800	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19800	24300	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 16th of 2008.
24300	27500	Happy St. Patrick's Day Eve to those of you out there.
27500	31000	Don't forget to wear green tomorrow, or don't forget to wear green three days ago
31000	33200	if you're listening on the podcast because you guys get a little late.
33200	36300	But hey, that's just part of the perks of listening live to us every Sunday night
36300	39000	when we tape over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
39000	41800	We have a chat room full of people who are doing that right now.
41800	46300	And for all you guys, whether it be live, syndicated, or podcast,
46300	48800	we're going to get back into the gaming news, aren't we, Loki?
48800	49400	Yes.
49400	53600	And if you live in the United States, you're probably looking forward to some pretty cool games
53600	57300	coming out into the arcade, like Tekken 6.
57300	62600	You're never going to get to play Tekken 6 because it's never coming to the arcade in the U.S.
62600	68900	So if you want to play in the arcade, got to go to Japan or hopefully find an arcade that will import it for you.
68900	70000	So that kind of sucks.
70000	71900	Of which there are a few of those kind of places.
71900	75000	Like I think of that one place we always used to go to in L.A.
75000	75600	Yeah.
75600	77400	What was that, Arcade Infinity? Is that what it's called?
77400	77800	Yeah.
77800	81700	Apparently there are a few places that are importing them.
81700	85800	There's a place in Houston, I guess, that also has a Tekken 6 machine.
85800	90300	But they're not going to be widely available like, you know, most fighting games are.
90300	92700	Go to an Amco arcade, they'll have it.
92700	93900	You think?
93900	99300	I'm pretty sure, because when I worked for Aladdin's Castle and Cyberstation,
99300	103200	we had like the super deluxe Tekken, this is when Tekken 3 came out.
103200	105500	But we had them well before everybody else did.
105500	107300	But that was a U.S. release, right?
107300	112700	Well, right, but we had them for months before they were allowed in any other arcade.
112700	116900	My curiosity is, though, is I almost wonder if the opposite wouldn't be true,
116900	119500	is that since this game won't come out in the U.S.,
119500	122100	the Namco arcades wouldn't support them.
122100	122600	I don't know.
122600	125500	I would think that they're going to have one or two.
125500	126200	Hmm.
126200	131100	I really think that the bigger Namco locations would have one.
131100	132300	Well, we'll see what happens.
132300	134400	Regardless, that kind of does suck, though.
134400	137100	I mean, to hear that a new Tekken game is coming out in the arcades is not...
137100	139000	That pisses me off!
139000	140100	Well, that's sad.
140100	141700	But that's where arcades are going.
141700	144300	It's not... That shows you how lucrative arcades are right now.
144300	144800	It's sad.
144800	146400	That makes my heart hurt.
148000	150000	Usagi's in chat and says,
150000	152400	Man, I have three gamers in this room with me,
152400	155700	and they all gave me a dirty look when they got the news about Tekken 6.
155700	158300	Sorry, guys. We don't write the news. We just report it.
158300	160300	I would say write your cards and letters to Namco.
160300	162200	Let them know you want to see this game in the U.S.
162200	165000	and that you would spend money on it.
165000	167700	Say Namco, we don't need any more fucking Pac-Man.
167700	169200	Bring us Tekken 6. Thank you.
169200	172100	Yeah, and phrase it just like that and see how far that gets you.
174400	174900	Alright.
174900	177200	That makes me very, very sad.
177200	178200	I'm sorry, are you going to write a letter?
178700	181500	Are you going to go there and run them over with a tank?
181500	182600	Haha!
183900	184900	Alright.
185900	188800	Moving on to what's hopefully a little bit happier news.
188800	189400	I don't know.
189400	192500	Gran Turismo 5, the prologue version.
192500	194900	Finally, some more information about that for the U.K.
194900	197100	We had some information about the U.S. last week,
197100	198800	but now we have some more information for the U.K.
198800	203100	It's going to be on the European PlayStation Store on March 27th,
203100	206400	followed immediately the very next day by a version on Blu-ray.
206400	210400	So yes, you can buy the prequel to a game that will be coming out on Blu-ray... whatever.
210400	213900	You all know the deal with Gran Turismo 5 prologue at this point.
213900	215800	The game will be coming out on that day,
215800	221000	and the price that you will pay for it is...
221000	222900	£24.99.
222900	226200	That's £24.99 pounds sterling in the U.K.
226200	229100	That's about $50 U.S.
229100	232200	That's just because the U.S. dollar sucks.
232200	234000	I might be at this point. I don't know.
234000	235200	It really is.
235200	237000	That still kind of sucks.
237000	237600	Everyone's like,
237600	239900	Oh, stuff's so much more expensive in the U.K.
239900	242100	No, our dollar just really sucks. That's all.
242100	244900	Also, there's the Europe PS3 bundle.
244900	247500	They're actually getting a bundle that has prologue in it.
247500	250800	£299 for that on March 28th.
250800	252400	We talked about that last week.
252400	254000	That's right.
254000	255000	Just want to remind.
255000	256700	They should have a little underscore on that.
256700	257300	You know, saying,
257300	259600	Get you ready for the full game when it finally comes out,
259600	261000	and we'll sell it to you for $60,
261000	262300	and you'll buy it because you are...
262300	266600	£60, which translates to, you know, $100 American, probably.
266600	267600	So...
267600	271000	Yeah, at that time, it would be like $6 billion American.
271000	277600	Well, for those loyal Tekken fans like me here over in the U.S.,
277600	282900	Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection Online players are going to be getting an update
282900	285700	that allows the DualShock 3 support.
285700	286700	So...
286700	287800	Yay.
287800	291600	It also will have some different online tweaks,
291600	294800	like a one-on-one pickup match,
294800	298800	some updates to the lobby,
298800	305100	and some of your ranking updates, that type of thing.
305100	306300	I'm like, okay.
306300	307600	Well, I guess that's kind of cool.
307600	310400	I mean, you know, considering, you know,
310400	313300	most people were missing Rumble pretty badly,
313300	315700	now the fact that they're going to bring it back, I guess...
315700	318100	I don't know, is it too little, too late, though?
318100	318600	Maybe.
318600	320800	I mean, do you think there'll be a lot of people that go back and say,
320800	324700	oh, I'm going to run back and play Tekken 5 because I can have Rumble now?
324700	325900	It's worth a try,
325900	329100	especially if you don't have to really, you know, pay anything for it.
329100	331700	I don't think anyone's going to really go back and play those games
331700	333200	just because they didn't have Rumble.
333200	333800	You know what, though?
333800	335200	Then again, I think about myself,
335200	336800	and I actually went back and played...
336800	338200	Do you remember that game Crystal Quest
338200	340600	that came out on Xbox Live like a year ago?
340600	343000	You know they did an upgrade to that not that long ago?
343000	345800	They had upgraded a game that added some type of combo meter in it,
345800	349400	so I went back and played the game to see if the combo meter was exciting.
349400	351600	I played about half a game, then I quit.
351600	352900	Because I was like, uh...
352900	356200	This game was much cooler when it was like originally on the Apple in two colors,
356200	358800	white and black.
358800	361900	It lost something along the way, I'm not sure what.
361900	364500	I liked it back when it was on the PC,
364500	368200	in like magenta and cyan, yellow and black.
368200	370500	I never even played the PC version, I always...
370500	371300	Go CGA.
371300	374400	I always thought of it as a Mac game.
374400	377400	Oh, I don't know if it was on the PC, I just, you know, like CGA.
377400	378100	Oh, you made it up.
378100	378600	I made it up.
378600	379200	I see how you are.
379200	380100	See, I'm so cool.
380100	382900	Wasn't there also a CGA like that had like,
382900	385100	I think it was like red, yellow, and green?
385100	389500	Yeah, it was red, yellow, green, and blue, I think.
389500	392400	You either had like, you know, the printer colors,
392400	397000	or like, you know, the crayon colors, I don't know.
397000	398400	But, uh, let's see here.
398400	401900	This week, completely off topic from CGA graphics,
401900	403900	um, Street Fighter IV...
403900	405800	And thank God!
405800	407800	Street Fighter IV, full CGA graphics.
407800	412000	If we were reporting on a new game that supported CGA cutting-edge technology,
412000	414000	I'd be like, wow, that's kind of sad.
414000	416400	You know what I did play once in CGA?
416400	417800	Tangent, tangent!
417800	420900	I played a strip poker game in CGA once.
420900	425900	You remember those old school strip poker games they released for like the old systems?
425900	429900	Like, there was, like, they had strip poker on the Commodore 64 and all that stuff.
429900	432900	It was just basically these really pixelated pictures of women.
432900	436200	You know, they had a CGA version of that.
436200	444800	There was, I don't, I remember that my grandparents or something bought us a Muppets game or something like that.
444800	446500	And we thought it didn't work.
446500	451400	Because the intro screen, or because it was in CGA or whatever,
451400	454100	we couldn't see that it said press any key to continue,
454100	456600	because it was written in black text on black.
456600	459600	So it was like, um, okay.
459600	462600	So finally, like one day, I turned the contrast up all the way.
462600	464200	I'm like, hey, there's something written there!
464200	468500	And then I saw that and I hit the button and, wow, this game sucks!
468500	471000	Uh, and some folks in chat are asking what's CGA.
471000	475200	Again, CGA was the old school, like, PC color graphics adapter,
475200	479200	and it was when your monitors went from being monochromed to four colors.
479200	484200	And you could either have red, green, yellow, and black, or cyan, magenta, uh,
484200	486200	what am I missing?
486200	487200	Yellow?
487200	489200	Yellow and black? No, but it wasn't that though, was it?
489200	491200	White and black. It was cyan, magenta, white, and black.
491200	492200	Oh, you're right, you're right.
492200	498200	Okay, and then after CGA was EGA, extended graphics adapter, when it went up to 16 colors.
498200	499200	Then we had VGA.
499200	501200	And then VGA, 256.
501200	502200	And then S-VGA.
502200	505200	Super VGA, and pretty much everything you see now is some type of extension.
505200	506200	XGA, yeah.
506200	508200	All that crap, so.
508200	512200	There you have it, a little history lesson from your old friends at Orange Lounge Radio,
512200	515200	your ever-aging friends.
515200	518200	Hey, I remember playing on monochrome.
518200	520200	So anyways, to get back into the story here, um...
520200	522200	Yeah, Street Fighter IV for four colors, right?
522200	525200	Yeah, Street Fighter IV, four color edition.
525200	532200	Um, they're getting a brand new character, a lucha libre wrestler named El Frito, or
532200	534200	Forte, I don't know how you pronounce it.
534200	535200	His name is El Farto?
535200	541200	His name is El Farto. No, I believe it's Ferté? I don't know.
541200	544200	Wasn't that a Howard Stern character, Fartman, or something like that?
544200	545200	Yes, Fartman was a Howard Stern.
545200	547200	Do you think Howard Stern will sue Capcom?
547200	548200	No.
548200	549200	Okay.
549200	554200	No, he should be El Aso Wipo, which would be fucking awesome if that was the case.
554200	560200	Um, but yeah, he is basically, you know, luchador, and, you know, people are kind of comparing
560200	563200	him between, like, Vega and Rey Mysterio.
563200	564200	I don't know.
564200	565200	Looks neat.
565200	570200	I am, I don't know, not that excited about Street Fighter IV, unfortunately.
570200	574200	I was afraid they'd give us Rainbow Mika again.
574200	577200	You know what's funny? I tried, I...
577200	583200	I forced my wife to watch some lucha libre last night, just very briefly, because we
583200	587200	couldn't find anything on TV, so I'm like, okay, lucha libre, I'm gonna turn that on.
587200	590200	Yeah, I don't like it.
590200	595200	RossdielUT in chat says, oh yay, another piss-poor Hispanic stereotype.
595200	601200	Wrong, another piss-poor masked wrestler stereotype.
601200	604200	That's true, if he wears a mask, you don't necessarily know exactly what his name is.
604200	605200	You know what, they just...
605200	606200	He could be Asian.
606200	608200	Or it could be, like, the end of Metroid.
608200	609200	Ooh, a woman.
609200	610200	Who knows?
610200	611200	Here comes the mask.
611200	613200	Holy woman.
613200	615200	Alright, sorry, you had Star Chakra?
615200	622200	I'm just saying, we just need, like, a new All Japan Wrestling game or something.
622200	623200	An All Japan Wrestling game?
623200	626200	Well, this one, the wrestling leagues.
626200	629200	Or did All Japan go, or was it Fire that went out?
629200	630200	Fire Pro.
630200	634200	Fire Pro Wrestling, they actually had a new game that came out last year.
634200	635200	Because I really...
635200	636200	On PlayStation 2.
636200	642200	I really think that, you know, we need to, because a lot of the WWF games that come out,
642200	647200	or WWE games that come out over here, have all of the moves from some of Japan's best
647200	648200	wrestlers in it.
648200	653200	I was like, why don't they just do a game called Stereotypical Wrestler the Game?
653200	654200	Awesome.
654200	659200	And have it just be, I mean, and true, you wouldn't have your support of your, you know,
659200	663200	your WWE franchises and all that, but you have all these classic moves and stuff shoved
663200	664200	into it.
664200	669200	And instead of being stuck in, like, 2D fighter, like what was the old WrestleMania that was
669200	673200	out way back in the day, where you could play as The Undertaker back when he was still really
673200	675200	cool and not riding a bike.
675200	678200	And who else was in that?
678200	680200	Doink the Clown?
680200	682200	You could play as them.
682200	683200	You know...
683200	684200	I would rather play as Pennywise the Clown.
684200	686200	That would be a video game I would buy.
686200	688200	We all float here.
688200	689200	Anyway.
689200	690200	Anyway.
690200	692200	Kiss me, fat boy.
692200	698200	But, I think that if they're, they should just satisfy the world's apparent need that
698200	704200	they think that we have for, you know, wrestler stereotypes, and just do wrestler stereotype
704200	710200	the game, and have you make whatever you want.
710200	711200	Even better.
711200	714200	I just worry that opens the door to racial stereotype the game, and not going to be a
714200	716200	good thing for video gaming's image.
716200	721200	I want a game that combines wrestling and katamari, so that, like, as you're fighting
721200	726200	them, like, body parts fall off and get stuck on your body, and you're fighting them.
726200	730200	Like, a fighting game where you're fighting, like, tons of people, and then your, like,
730200	732200	character has, like, 50 arms and stuff.
732200	733200	That'd be pretty cool.
733200	734200	What was that old school game?
734200	735200	Thrill Kill?
735200	736200	Really old school.
736200	737200	Huh?
737200	738200	Not Thrill Kill.
738200	739200	No.
739200	740200	It was, uh, it came out around the time of Mortal Kombat.
740200	742200	Like, it tried to one-up Mortal Kombat.
742200	743200	Pit Fighter?
743200	746200	And the attack buttons were, like, arm, arm, leg, leg, and head.
746200	750200	And, like, you would chop off limbs, and then the person couldn't use that type of attack
750200	751200	anymore.
751200	752200	CarnEvil?
752200	753200	Was it Time Killers?
753200	754200	Was that what it was?
754200	755200	Time Killers.
755200	756200	Was Time Killers?
756200	757200	Time Killers.
757200	758200	It was, like, not Eternal Champion or something.
758200	759200	No, I'm pretty sure it was Time Killers.
759200	760200	It was Time Killers.
760200	761200	There was a Viking in it.
761200	762200	I think it was, yeah.
762200	763200	Yeah.
763200	764200	Okay, it was Time Killers.
764200	765200	Like, there you go.
765200	766200	You should have that game mixed with katamari.
766200	767200	Time Killers 2.
767200	770200	You know what made me think of Thrill Kill is the character that, um, looks like, uh,
770200	775200	Ken on one side and Ryu on the other side that are both hands, and a torso.
775200	776200	Well, you do-
776200	777200	That's what it made me think of.
777200	781880	You know, spoiler, if you play to the end of Smash Bros. in single-player mode, the
781880	784680	boss is a giant hand, just like the last game.
784680	787440	Because the hand is always there.
787440	788440	Alright.
788440	791360	And I think the hand is really Mickey Mouse.
791360	796400	In other Street Fighter news, if I may, uh, moving on to another anticipated Street Fighter
796400	801360	release is Street Fighter 2 HD, uh, I'm not gonna call the whole thing, it's like, what
801360	803240	is it, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo?
803240	805500	Forget it, it's Street Fighter 2 HD, okay?
805500	809120	This game is coming out, um, soon.
809120	810120	What do you mean it's the happy one?
810120	811760	Is that the one that the art is?
811760	816060	Yes, basically it's, you know, it's Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, but it's all been
816060	817800	completely redone in HD.
817800	820200	By one of my favorite groups of artists.
820200	824120	Yeah, it's gonna be cool, but here's the thing, you can get a sneak peek at it.
824120	830800	In the beta version, uh, if you buy Wolf of the Battlefield Commando 3, which is another
830800	838160	Xbox Live Arcade game, you'll get access to the Super Street Fighter 2 HD game, you get
838160	841720	an access key for the public beta stress test.
841720	846040	Something to note about that though, apparently in the stress test, the rumor is, it's only
846040	850080	Ken, it's only Ryu, and it's only one stage that you can play in.
850080	854080	But still, it's a sneak peek at what the game's gonna look like.
854080	856800	Wanna try another sneak peek of what the game will look like?
856800	859920	It's called Street Fighter 2.
859920	861080	It's already available on Xbox Live.
861080	869200	I'm actually very excited about this because I had a whole bunch of Udon Cruz stuff, and
869200	873820	actually I keep them on my DeviantArt friends list, just to see the previews and the new
873820	877400	art coming out that they do, and their work is fantastic.
877400	882880	It's just really, really good and perfect for that genre.
882880	883880	I think it's really good.
883880	886780	Oh yeah, I don't mean to knock the awesome art style in this game, but do you know why
886780	889000	this game keeps getting pushed back?
889000	895680	So that we'll forget we already spent $10 on it a year ago.
895680	896680	Just wanted to say.
896680	897680	I'm gonna get it.
897680	902980	So, it is a public beta of the game.
902980	903980	Call it what you will.
903980	909320	I don't know, in some way it seems to me like kind of a cheap tactic to get people more
909320	914520	incentive to buy this Commando 3, then again, why do you think tons of people bought Crackdown?
914520	916860	But Crackdown actually ended up to be a really good game.
916860	921280	Not to say that Commando 3 won't as well, but it's interesting that that same tactic
921280	922920	is now being employed elsewhere.
922920	923920	That's what I could do.
923920	924920	Did you see Crackdown?
924920	925920	I like jumping the game.
925920	926920	It's awesome though.
926920	931160	Did you see the HD remake of 1942 that they were showing off too this week?
931160	932280	I had heard about it.
932280	935800	It didn't make the show real quick tonight, but what did you see about this?
935800	936800	It looks awesome.
936800	937800	Well, I like 1942.
937800	938800	It's pretty cool.
938800	940800	That's a great series of games.
940800	943880	It's basically just redone all HD and pretty, I don't know.
943880	947240	You know, interesting that Capcom's revisiting a lot of their series in HD because you also
947240	949280	have Bionic Commando also coming out.
949280	951960	But that's kind of cool because a lot of it's been saying for a long time that's what they
951960	958800	should be doing, is remaking the games in HD and not just releasing frumpy old Tron
958800	959800	with no frills.
959800	961400	Like Frogger and shit like that.
961400	962400	That's retarded.
962400	965680	With one graphics swap that doesn't really change anything.
965680	968300	Or Contra, you know, Konami, we're looking at you.
968300	969880	Come on, man.
969880	973800	Seriously, we played Frogger, do something with it.
973800	975720	It's changing the sprites a little bit.
975720	976720	Does not cut it.
976720	981660	I still thought it was funny that when we got the old Contra over here, it actually
981660	986160	had less stuff to it than the original did.
986160	987160	You know what pissed me off?
987160	990440	You know what game I was randomly playing the other day, just for old time's sake, was
990440	992280	Gyruss on Xbox Live Arcade?
992280	993280	Sweet!
993280	995840	Well, it is one of my all-time favorite shooters that they had in the arcade.
995840	996840	I freaking love Gyruss.
996840	999360	I used to play it on Commodore 64 all the time, right?
999360	1000480	And they have it on Xbox Live.
1000480	1001760	It came out quite some time ago.
1001760	1005220	I was playing it for old time's sake the other day, and I just remembered how pissed off
1005220	1010600	I was of the Xbox Live version, because the new graphics and upgraded graphics are awful.
1010600	1014000	I enjoy playing the game in classic mode much better.
1014000	1018760	You can't see the bullets in some of the animation in the remade version.
1018760	1019760	It's awful.
1019760	1020760	Cry.
1020760	1021760	Very sad.
1021760	1028120	Well, there's a little bit of other news that should make some people happy.
1028120	1034120	Crysis Corps Final Fantasy VII Special Edition is coming out in the UK.
1034120	1045000	It's, well, actually more of a special pre-order edition that Gamestation is offering that
1045000	1049360	will have a 48-page art book and slipcase packaging.
1049360	1056600	It will be £29.99, and it's actually the same price as the non-special edition, so
1056600	1061440	basically you pre-order it from there, you get the Nito book, and you don't pay any different
1061440	1065880	than you would have otherwise.
1065880	1076000	But there are also, though, going to be getting Crysis Corps Final Fantasy VII on PSP in spring,
1076000	1081000	but Gamestation has it down for summer, so you'll actually get it before then.
1081000	1083480	Just hop on there and take a look at it.
1083480	1085480	Hooray for incentives.
1085480	1086480	Neat.
1086480	1090960	Unfortunately, I'm not getting anything like that over here as far as I'm aware.
1090960	1091960	Boo.
1091960	1093560	Who cares?
1093560	1094560	It's an art book.
1094560	1096880	I mean, honestly, who keeps the art books and stuff?
1096880	1098560	I just like free things.
1098560	1101480	I had an art book for Try Again one time I bought.
1101480	1103520	I don't even know where the fuck it is now.
1103520	1104520	It's gone.
1104520	1106520	Oh well.
1106520	1113240	So, unfortunately, and everyone's been kind of watching this a little bit, EA and their
1113240	1119800	bid to try to take over Take-Two, now they have decided to go hostile with their bid
1119800	1126560	and they're actually going to try to buy out individual shareholders now at $26 a share,
1126560	1134920	and no real comment to what's going to be happening here, but apparently EA has confirmed
1134920	1141860	that, yes, they are doing this, and Take-Two has basically informed their shareholders
1141860	1146920	to hold out a little bit to see what's going to happen or see what kind of decision they
1146920	1148640	come up with.
1148640	1149640	I don't know.
1149640	1155200	I don't like the whole thing at all because EA puts out some pretty good games, but at
1155200	1160720	the same time I know why they're doing it just to get rid of the 2K sports franchise,
1160720	1161880	and that's not a good thing.
1161880	1168080	I mean, the sports games really haven't innovated too much between releases, and now if they
1168080	1172040	have full reign over everything, what makes you think they're actually going to try to
1172040	1173040	innovate each year?
1173040	1174040	They don't have to.
1174040	1179640	An odd one in chat at chat.orangelaundryradio.com says, I expect EA to eventually just walk
1179640	1181720	into the boardroom with socks full of quarters.
1181720	1183720	You're ours now.
1183720	1186280	RossdielUT says, Take-Two put themselves in this position.
1186280	1190960	They're only ever in the green when GTA comes out, so of course shareholders are nervous.
1190960	1195200	Interesting point, though, kind of brought up there is that do you think that EA is trying
1195200	1198000	to do this now before Grand Theft Auto hits shelves?
1198000	1199000	Yeah.
1199000	1202840	I think that they're trying to, and if the shareholders were smart, they got to know
1202840	1206840	that Grand Theft Auto IV is going to fucking make tons and tons and tons and tons and tons
1206840	1207840	of money.
1207840	1210920	The problem, and they are right, they don't have a lot of great releases that come out,
1210920	1214040	but at the same time I think a lot of their money has been trying to defend themselves
1214040	1220820	against all these lawsuits and shit from stupid fuckers suing them for God knows what, blaming
1220820	1227420	them for all sorts of violence and problems and people being scarred for life because
1227420	1231760	they saw really crappy looking boobs in a game or something like that.
1231760	1233320	Just retarded shit.
1233320	1237880	And that whole thing about getting five dollars just from saying that, you know, Grand Theft
1237880	1242800	Auto made you, you know, violated you in so many ways?
1242800	1248640	It's just, it's really dumb, so hopefully, you know, hopefully they're not lazy with
1248640	1253860	this release if there is any content in there that's questionable because, you know, people
1253860	1260840	are going to find it if there is, and for the love of God, Manhunt 2, I mean, that's
1260840	1261840	a perfect example.
1261840	1265760	Here's another interesting comment from RossDlut, and Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer does far
1265760	1269760	more damage to EA than 2K Sports ever will, so there are other sports games coming out
1269760	1270760	from other places.
1270760	1271760	Yeah?
1271760	1272760	So no.
1272760	1275960	Odd1, I keep reading for the same people, but these are good comments, Odd1 in chat
1275960	1280140	says it's not like they don't have other games, BioShock was 2K and their sports franchises
1280140	1284200	are perpetual sellers, but this company relies so much on one game, I worry.
1284200	1288080	Well, it's Take, well, everyone's focusing on Take Two, but Take Two owns, you know,
1288080	1291620	a bunch of smaller companies that do release a lot of stuff, like 2K releases quite a few
1291620	1296160	games throughout the year, plus, you know, they do have a lot of smaller stuff that they
1296160	1301800	deal with, like, not Destination, but like, no, Destination, or DSi games I think they
1301800	1306640	do, not Destineer, but they have a lot of releases that come out that a lot of people
1306640	1312560	don't realize are from them, and, you know, they do have solid stuff coming out, it's
1312560	1317200	just, yeah, they do rely a lot on Grand Theft Auto, but there's, you know, Midnight Club,
1317200	1323000	and they've got some good stuff in the pipelines, you know, Knorr, and the new Mafia game looks
1323000	1328080	okay, not that they're really that different than Grand Theft Auto, but at least they're
1328080	1333120	pretty decent games, and they make what they put out pretty good, like Warriors, holy crap,
1333120	1340000	the Warriors game is awesome, it's just, I don't know, I'd rather them kind of fumble
1340000	1347360	through it and be their own entity than EA buy them, because if EA buys them, then, I
1347360	1350800	think that could be starting a downfall of, like, the gaming industry, because you're
1350800	1354880	going to have EA and Activision owning everything, and then pretty soon, they're going to be
1354880	1357480	like, hey, you know what, we don't really have to innovate too much, and then people
1357480	1360440	are just going to lose interest in this shit, and they're just like, well, fine, I'm not
1360440	1363500	going to buy any more games anymore, and there goes the industry.
1363500	1369540	Or the industry turns independent, kind of like I was saying before, you have, you know,
1369540	1374080	the XLA stuff coming out, you know, that could be a whole, that I think is a really big thing,
1374080	1375080	I don't know.
1375080	1376880	The XNA stuff, yeah, it looks pretty good.
1376880	1379280	I'm sorry, XNA, what the hell was I saying, XLA?
1379280	1381760	SSJ100Matt says Warriors MMO, please.
1381760	1388440	Yeah, that'd be awesome, and RossUUT in chat says, look, they still bleed money in the
1388440	1390480	years between Grand Theft Auto.
1390480	1396320	True they do, and I know developing from, you know, San Andreas to now, obviously the
1396320	1400640	last two prequel games that they released, Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories
1400640	1404040	weren't that great and didn't make them that much money, I don't think that much development
1404040	1407640	time went into them, though, either, because they're pretty much just using the old engines.
1407640	1410960	But that's the same thing that's going to happen with the newer games, you know, obviously
1410960	1413960	the next game, you know, they're probably going to do another Vice City or something
1413960	1418240	like that, it's going to be using a similar engine and another San Andreas, maybe they'll
1418240	1421360	use another similar engine, and those will make a lot of money as well.
1421360	1426360	So I don't know, a lot of development up front, but I think they make it up in the back end
1426360	1427360	a little bit.
1427360	1431620	All right, well, lots of legal news, I mean, you could consider that some type of legal
1431620	1435240	news, and then there's just lawsuits going everywhere this week, and they all center
1435240	1437400	around Guitar Hero.
1437400	1443280	Harmonix actually sued and then ensued Activision earlier this week, and it all had to do basically
1443280	1448840	that, okay, the original Guitar Hero, I guess, had some type of clause that Harmonix would
1448840	1453360	get some type of royalty payment, the way the royalty payments were set up, if they
1453360	1455880	ever left the series.
1455880	1459660	And there were two different figures, one was low, one was high, and they're basically
1459660	1463680	saying Harmonix was claimed that they were being paid the lower royalty scheme, and they
1463680	1468680	should be getting about $14.5 million out of Guitar Hero 3's profits.
1468680	1475560	But then I guess at some point this was retracted, so there it was, and I don't know if maybe
1475560	1479640	there was some type of settlement out of court, but the settlement was clearly retracted.
1479640	1485820	But then Gibson jumped in the mix, Gibson, of course, makes guitars, Gibson decided to
1485820	1490900	sue Activision, and they said the reason why is because Activision was actually infringing
1490900	1499520	on a patent that dates back nine years for technology to simulate a musical performance.
1499520	1504480	Activision is, of course, filed basically saying that the claim is invalid.
1504480	1510820	Gibson actually sent Activision a letter in January saying, Activision basically said,
1510820	1515160	you know, well, since you didn't really do anything about it, we thought it was okay.
1515160	1516160	Interesting.
1516160	1522600	Yeah, just like immersion, well, you didn't say anything until now, so we thought it was
1522600	1525560	okay that we stole your shit.
1525560	1528920	But I thought Gibson was licensed for Guitar Hero, I mean, don't they have like Gibson
1528920	1529920	guitars?
1529920	1531560	Gibson licensed their guitars.
1531560	1535720	So this is stupid.
1535720	1540240	But then what's interesting about it is that you also kind of think about, hmm, you know,
1540240	1544120	whatever happened to Guitar Freaks, because even though Gibson owns the thing and it's
1544120	1548240	nine years old, nine years old places you back at what, 1999?
1548240	1554160	Well, guess what, Guitar Freaks was in the production and planning stages in 1998, around
1554160	1557160	the time the DDR first came out.
1557160	1562960	Did Gibson possibly catch wind of Guitar Freaks over in Japan and filed the patent here in
1562960	1567240	the U.S. and that's why Guitar Freaks never has really made it out here in the U.S.?
1567240	1571160	But it did make it out over here in the U.S., they released the U.S. version over here.
1571160	1576000	One very minor, not very well-heard of version that I bet completely slipped under most people's
1576000	1578280	radars, honestly.
1578280	1582640	They think if it comes out in Japan it's, you know, free reign to, you know, take it
1582640	1583640	here.
1583640	1585400	Odd One says, I love that conspiracy theory.
1585400	1586400	I do too.
1586400	1591660	No, I'm pretty sure, I'm more than positive that that was the biggest influence.
1591660	1595920	I'm tired of people like patenting all this shit like, you know, device tube simulate
1595920	1596920	performance.
1596920	1598620	Okay, well that could be anything, I mean.
1598620	1604320	And at some point though, if Gibson doesn't do it, it should negate itself.
1604320	1605440	What did Gibson put out?
1605440	1608560	Or maybe, I don't know, maybe there was some kind of, teach yourself at home.
1608560	1611480	Yeah, I would love to see their patent for this, I mean, because what is it?
1611480	1615080	It's a concept of, you know, simulating a performance.
1615080	1618520	Okay, so pretending is now being patented.
1618520	1619520	That's it.
1619520	1626640	I am patenting imagination because, you know, the ability to simulate anything in your mind,
1626640	1628620	I now own the rights to that.
1628620	1631760	So all you fuckers better pay up because I need the money.
1631760	1638240	Alright, look, all these lawsuits are kind of just, they seem unnecessary and confusing
1638240	1641760	and just trying to follow them all gets us a little bit angsty.
1641760	1643900	And you know what happens when we get angsty?
1643900	1645280	We play the FUs of the week music.
1645280	1666680	Hi, FU of the week, and I've got a couple actually, goes to this device that I'm about
1666680	1675440	to put up on the webcam, and I am currently strapping it to my hand as I, as I speak.
1675440	1677440	It is the stupid finger brace that they think I'm supposed to be wearing, that I'm not gonna,
1677440	1683360	because it rubs a wall spot on my hand, and that's because I'm not backwards.
1683360	1688480	Yeah, I didn't get the cortisone shot in my hand like I thought I was going to.
1688480	1694680	Instead, they're putting me in a brace for another month, and I get the cortisone shot
1694680	1696800	right after my birthday.
1696800	1699080	You might want to say that just really quickly one more time, because while you're trying
1699080	1701360	to put the brace on, the mic was far away, it couldn't hear you.
1701360	1702360	Oh, I was thinking that.
1702360	1703360	That's alright.
1703360	1704360	Um, yeah.
1704360	1707720	I put this on because I'm going to put it on the webcam to show everybody, they put
1707720	1711640	me in a brace for my finger that I'm supposed to be wearing when I'm not typing or otherwise
1711640	1716140	doing stuff, and it's actually a big pain in the ass because I can't, it's to keep me
1716140	1720520	from bending my finger at the primary joint where I've got the swelling on the tendon.
1720520	1729160	So they didn't do the cortisone shot, instead I am getting it done two days after my birthday.
1729160	1730720	It's a fuck you enhancement tool.
1730720	1731920	It is a fuck you enhancement tool.
1731920	1732920	You should go show the folks on JustinTV.
1732920	1733920	That's what I said I was gonna.
1733920	1735000	Alright, then go, go ahead.
1735000	1742840	And the other, the other F.U. goes to my husband for assigning me housework, which yes, true,
1742840	1746680	it needed to be done, but it's all stuff that involved using my right hand to squeeze things,
1746680	1752120	as in the vacuum, the mop, the broom, and well, I'm not supposed to be doing that with
1752120	1758920	that hand, and I had forgotten to take my anti-inflammatory, so it hurt like a bitch
1758920	1759920	by the time I was done.
1759920	1763920	It's the point that it started popping again, so it was really, really, really fucked up,
1763920	1765920	but I'll go put it on the webcam.
1765920	1771200	Alright, meanwhile, Loki, F.U. the people that went and saw the movie Horton Hears a
1771200	1778340	Who during our private screening, two groups of people in particular, number one was the
1778340	1784480	people that thought it was smart to try to movie hop into our private screening for our
1784480	1785480	company.
1785480	1789860	I mean, these are people that actually think that we're not gonna notice somebody that
1789860	1795200	doesn't work in our company coming in, meanwhile, like with like a half an hour left of the
1795200	1800880	movie to go, with their four screaming kids, and then after they came in, spilled popcorn
1800880	1806640	on the floor, they also managed to ask people to move so that their screaming kids can sit
1806640	1808040	in the seat.
1808040	1812400	Mind you that these people have been sitting watching the movie patiently for like an hour
1812400	1814160	prior to that.
1814160	1819480	So F.U. to them, and also F.U. to the person sitting next to me with their screaming child
1819480	1824000	who didn't wanna be, or didn't wanna watch the movie anymore, he was running around in
1824000	1829600	the aisles and stuff, and smashing popcorn on the floor, and slamming the seats down,
1829600	1834640	and the father was like, stop laughing, stop laughing, you know, cuz, you know, quiet.
1834640	1835920	How dare you laugh at this funny movie!
1835920	1837680	Shouldn't they have been kicked out?
1837680	1841920	Well, they should have been, but, you know, movie theater people are, you know, lame and
1841920	1846680	they don't like to do anything, and they don't get paid enough to do anything.
1846680	1847680	Why did you get the manager?
1847680	1851680	Well, I didn't feel like leaving the theater, and I could possibly tolerate this kid, but
1851680	1856320	he was annoying, and everyone was staring at him, but the dad was just stupid, and,
1856320	1857320	you know.
1857320	1862600	Oh well, everyone will talk about him behind his back when he gets back to work on Monday.
1862600	1868480	Alright, my F.U. of the week goes to the random pains that I've been having, and the fact
1868480	1871540	that I was taking all these drugs to counter the pain, and I might have caused more pain
1871540	1876840	by doing that, and F.U. to the fact that on the antibiotic I was taking, the sticker that
1876840	1880920	says do not take with antacids was probably not large enough, because I ended up taking
1880920	1887280	an antacid, and I think I fucked some- I hurt, but I'm having a hard time with telling
1887280	1889140	you tonight's show, but I'll be okay.
1889140	1893760	Just F.U. to mystery pain that after the lab tests and blood work and all this stuff I
1893760	1897360	had, they still can't figure out what it is, although thankfully my abdominal pain is really
1897360	1899560	going away, so I guess that's good.
1899560	1904320	It's one of those mystery things we'll never understand.
1904320	1907280	So yeah, F.U. to random sickness and pain.
1907280	1908280	It sucks.
1908280	1910680	No, I'm not pregnant, chat.
1910680	1911680	F.U.
1911680	1912680	F.U. to chat.
1912680	1913960	Why do they say you're pregnant?
1913960	1917200	I don't know, because you know when you have abdominal pain, it might be the baby kicking.
1917200	1919000	I don't know.
1919000	1920600	I can't explain their reasoning.
1920600	1924520	All right, we are going to go to one of our favorite segments here on the program.
1924520	1928000	It's the part where you guys get to interact with us.
1928000	1931680	It's the part called the mailbag.
1931680	1932680	It's not just a clever name.
1932680	1936740	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is where you send your emails, of which not very many
1936740	1938080	of you sent in emails this week.
1938080	1942520	I'm quite disappointed in our listenership.
1942520	1945560	Dark Soccer is thrilled, because she doesn't have to do much work in this segment tonight.
1945560	1948120	However, I am furious.
1948120	1949560	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1949560	1953640	Send us those questions you've always wanted to ask us, those comments you wanted to say.
1953640	1959520	Meanwhile, Dark Soccer will open up and read the crumbs that we do have.
1959520	1962640	First email comes from DJ Jinai.
1962640	1964520	It says, Hi, O.L.R.
1964520	1965520	It's DJ Jinai.
1965520	1967720	Oh, that's not just a clever name.
1967720	1969040	It says, Check this out.
1969040	1970760	And basically, it's a link to something.
1970760	1978520	Smile DK will be looking for their samurai at San Japan, first major anime convention
1978520	1989520	in SA-to-premier band's first-ever U.S. debut concert.
1989520	1994160	San Japan and Viverus Studios are proud to announce the North American musical debut
1994160	2000520	concert of their fan-favorite band, Smile DK, making their grand appearance at San Japan
2000520	2006160	2.5, the first major Japanese culture and anime convention in San Antonio, Texas, as
2006160	2011840	they will be performing on August 9, 2008 at El Tropicano Riverwalk Hotel in downtown
2011840	2014440	San Antonio, Texas.
2014440	2017600	I'm sure most of us know who Smile DK is.
2017600	2021400	Anyway, they're going to have a new single, so I thought that was pretty cool, and thanks
2021400	2025400	for letting us know about that so that we can tell everybody.
2025400	2034520	I hope they sing Butterfly.
2034520	2039280	As an avid UK-based listener of your show, my heart nearly skipped a beat at the news
2039280	2041160	last week of Super Smash Bros.
2041160	2045440	Brawl's launch, Imagine My Horror, but lack of disbelief, when I then checked with my
2045440	2049040	friendly favorite online retailer and found out that Super Smash Bros.
2049040	2052520	Brawl wasn't to be released until June in the UK.
2052520	2058560	Let's write a three-month wait for a AAA title that has already been translated into English.
2058560	2063240	The thing is, I know why this happens, it's the whole NTSC, PAL, and multiple European
2063240	2068120	language thing means that there will be delays, but Nintendo has launched simultaneous releases
2068120	2069760	before.
2069760	2073920	To be honest, I really don't see why Nintendo and other companies cannot treat the UK as
2073920	2076460	a separate territory to the rest of Europe.
2076460	2080360	We don't even have the same taste in games, not that I wish to arouse traditional British
2080360	2086080	anti-continental sentiment, if it's in English release the damn game in the country that
2086080	2087080	made the damn language.
2087080	2092000	Well, there's a lot of games that get released in the UK too that we don't receive over here
2092000	2093000	until a lot later.
2093000	2094000	We didn't get Mother 3.
2094000	2095880	Like anything from Eidos.
2095880	2098560	We didn't get Mother 3.
2098560	2103840	The other thing too is that a lot of games like Smash Bros., it's selling like hotcakes
2103840	2106040	and they can't make enough discs.
2106040	2108440	Well, there's more to this email.
2108440	2113720	As for Super Smash Bros. Brawl, I bought the new freeloader disc for the Wii and have imported
2113720	2115720	a copy of the game from Canada.
2115720	2118920	Here's me flippin' the bird to you Nintendo of Europe.
2118920	2122240	As for the Digidoo Technoguy, I've seen him in person.
2122240	2126780	He was playing on the streets of Edinburgh during the Edinburgh Arts Festival in Scotland
2126780	2127780	last summer.
2127780	2132600	I have my own video footage if you want to see slash hear more, and I guess it would
2132600	2136480	be pronounced Nige.
2136480	2137480	So that's cool.
2137480	2138480	Next email?
2138480	2139480	Alrighty.
2139480	2140480	Hey, OLR crew.
2140480	2156160	In the words of AVGN, you know it's bullshit.
2156160	2160440	People who complain that a game is too short just because it takes under 10 hours to complete.
2160440	2164480	Whatever happened to a time when games usually took 30 to 60 minutes to clear and gamers
2164480	2165920	were happy with it?
2165920	2171000	These days, when I read a review of an arcade-style scrolling shooter or 2D platformer, one complaint
2171000	2174240	that I see commonly that sticks out to me is that the game is short.
2174240	2178920	I understand that longer, more epic games allow you to take in the game environment
2178920	2182760	and absorb yourself in the character, but it's nice to play a quick short game that
2182760	2185240	is intended to be replayed again and again.
2185240	2189200	Even Gradius 5, a shooter that takes an hour and a half to complete, gets complaints of
2189200	2190800	being too short.
2190800	2196760	Someone please explain to me how a 25-hour shmup would work out and how that isn't going
2196760	2199800	to put a strain on the level designers.
2199800	2204360	Now a year and a half ago, you asked listeners if games these days are getting easier.
2204360	2205600	This is related to that question.
2205600	2209840	Do you think games are getting longer and longer and that shorter meant-to-be-beaten-in-one-sitting
2209840	2210840	games are going away?
2210840	2213880	That's from GS68.
2213880	2216960	You know, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head there is that it's not the fact
2216960	2221080	maybe that a game takes less than 10 hours to beat that people rag on it, but if it has
2221080	2225860	no replay value, then, you know, it sucks.
2225860	2230680	For instance, a game like Katamari Damacy, can't you roll through that game in like two
2230680	2231680	or three hours tops?
2231680	2234400	Yeah, but you can go back through and get the challenges.
2234400	2237800	Exactly, and that's why people love that game because you have the total replay value and
2237800	2239880	just, you know, it's cool to go roll stuff up.
2239880	2242840	Now even though I kind of think they've beaten the Katamari franchise into the ground, but
2242840	2247040	never mind, I'm talking about, you know, the original one, had definite replay value to
2247040	2248040	it.
2248040	2250400	Well, we've gone back though and put in all of our old shooters before, even though you
2250400	2251960	pretty much play them all the same way.
2251960	2252960	Sure.
2252960	2258160	I mean, how many times do I just go talking about, you know, loving R-Type, for example?
2258160	2263040	But a game like a role-playing game that really relies on story to, you know, motivate you
2263040	2266880	to play the game, you know, once you've played through the story once, very few RPGs have
2266880	2268560	a lot of replay value.
2268560	2269560	Chrono Trigger.
2269560	2273520	Well, you know, obviously some do with, be it multiple endings, super bosses, whatever
2273520	2276760	it is, you know, they try to put a little more value in it.
2276760	2279560	Every RPG needs Game Plus.
2279560	2283080	But that's why some RPGs feel a little bit lacking, is that when they don't have that
2283080	2286620	and they're only ten hours to beat, then, you know, it might be.
2286620	2288960	So it really depends on what type of game it is, I guess.
2288960	2292640	Well, it is even bringing up though with people complaining that Gradius 5 was short even
2292640	2298000	though it was an hour and a half, and I completely disagree with them saying it was remotely
2298000	2299000	short.
2299000	2304000	That a shooter, you know, shouldn't need to be more than, like, an hour in length.
2304000	2308520	Because the whole point is to get from point A to point B, and then hopefully pass the
2308520	2316820	boss at point B and get to point C. You know, I actually liked some of the, I guess, not
2316820	2317820	as long shooters.
2317820	2324000	Like, I played through Cotton however many times, and Raiden DX is another one of my
2324000	2327680	favorite shooter games.
2327680	2331000	Just with shooter games, part of the fun is trying to play it through it and beat your
2331000	2335840	score or beat it faster, you know, and start to learn the patterns in the game, you know?
2335840	2336840	I could tell you anything.
2336840	2341080	I could probably pick up SkyShark right now and play through the first four levels and
2341080	2344440	not die because I had the game memorized because that's the only damn way you could play through
2344440	2346480	that game was to memorize where everything was.
2346480	2347480	Nice.
2347480	2352520	But still, I mean, I think that half of it is just being able to, you know, you challenge
2352520	2356980	your way through it and you pod through it and then you get bragging rights, like, watch
2356980	2357980	me play through this game.
2357980	2362480	I can do, like, you know, beating R-Type on one token, for example.
2362480	2365600	That gives you major bragging rights, you know what I mean?
2365600	2366600	That is pretty hardcore.
2366600	2367600	Yeah.
2367600	2370760	I say token because I miss arcades.
2370760	2376240	So last email, because we actually got another one while we were sitting here.
2376240	2377600	Just now?
2377600	2379840	Not just now, but we got it right, poor pull-up millet.
2379840	2380840	Gotcha.
2380840	2383240	So, virtual console games are overpriced.
2383240	2387200	You guys have already gone over this, but you haven't gone over it in a while, so this
2387200	2390560	is kind of irrelevant to, well, anything.
2390560	2394960	But I have, but I have an idea to fix it.
2394960	2399320	If people pay yearly subscriptions for Xbox Live and Nintendo could do something like
2399320	2400320	that for virtual console.
2400320	2404400	Yes, I mean, exactly along the lines of the Sega channel because I freaking love the Sega
2404400	2405400	channel.
2405400	2408720	It's not, I'm not actually sure how it would work, but I thought I would share it, and
2408720	2410720	that's from Red Ring Saturn.
2410720	2411720	Yeah?
2411720	2415400	Oh, I'm sorry, why don't I have one more time real quick?
2415400	2417400	Oh, I was working on something else, sorry.
2417400	2422440	Well, we've actually brought this up on the show of instead of paying for your virtual
2422440	2424800	console games, you pay a subscription cost, like...
2424800	2426360	Oh, like GameTap.
2426360	2427360	Yeah.
2427360	2428360	Basically.
2428360	2430560	I would love to see Nintendo set something like that up.
2430560	2432240	They're talking about the Sega channel.
2432240	2435840	Yeah, a lot of their games, you know, you don't want to spend five bucks on, you know,
2435840	2440080	a game that you only want to play a couple times, but I think that's exactly why it's
2440080	2445120	not set up that way because I think Nintendo, in a way, kind of preys on that sort of system.
2445120	2450140	I've also heard of Xbox Live, you know, somebody had suggested instead of charging the five
2450140	2456740	dollars for the game, you pay 25 cents a play, but, you know, then I think about like some
2456740	2460920	of the systems like back in the 80s and 90s, like I remember I had an old school cable
2460920	2461920	system back in the 80s.
2461920	2463760	It was way ahead of its time.
2463760	2468720	We had a system where you could actually buy games for like 10 cents a game and play them,
2468720	2469720	and it didn't do very well.
2469720	2471600	It wasn't very well received.
2471600	2476680	People don't like to play that way for whatever reason.
2476680	2480440	I think honestly if they stop making money, they'll change it, but in the meantime it
2480440	2482560	works and if it ain't broke, they ain't going to fix it.
2482560	2487400	I mean it might sound better from a consumer end, but, you know, look at what GameTap is
2487400	2488400	made up of though.
2488400	2490060	GameTap kind of makes a thriving on.
2490060	2492920	It doesn't have a lot of, I mean it has, I shouldn't say it doesn't have a lot, it has
2492920	2498400	some huge name AAA titles in it, but a lot of GameTap's charm is discovering old classics
2498400	2500480	you missed the first time.
2500480	2504120	Nintendo, Xbox Live, they don't really need to do that for various reasons.
2504120	2507320	So that was the last email?
2507320	2508320	It was.
2508320	2509320	I double checked.
2509320	2510320	All right.
2510320	2515160	Well, we're going to supplement the emails this week with some voicemails that we've
2515160	2516360	gotten throughout the week.
2516360	2520320	So let's actually go and check out some voicemails that we've received this week.
2520320	2524760	Please don't call the show because we're not actually taking Skype calls at this time.
2524760	2527040	We're just trying to get through some voicemails.
2527040	2530040	And when you call, it switches my window on me and it makes me very angry.
2530040	2532640	It makes me want to make you not able to call us later.
2532640	2533640	Hey, O.R.R.
2533640	2534640	It's PKJR92.
2534640	2542000	Just wanted to tell you guys that you guys are the greatest.
2542000	2548320	And if you're not for the difference in time zones, I will post them live every Sunday
2548320	2554080	on every show on your network.
2554080	2559560	Just want to say, guys, you guys are great, thanks.
2559560	2568600	And to do a show earlier, like earlier, so that people in other time zones, like me,
2568600	2572600	I'm like three hours behind you, or sorry, ahead of you.
2572600	2578720	So 12 o'clock at night is kind of late because I've got school tomorrow, school the next
2578720	2580720	day, et cetera.
2580720	2590480	Just want to say that keep going, because you guys are the only podcast I listen to,
2590480	2592800	so the only ones I like.
2592800	2593800	So see you.
2593800	2596400	Well, thank you very much for that voicemail.
2596400	2599840	The reason why we don't tape our show earlier is because, keep in mind, even though it's
2599840	2604020	three hours later and all that, we do understand, we have some folks that stay up insanely late
2604020	2606800	to listen to our show, and nothing but props to you guys.
2606800	2611760	The problem is, though, if we tape earlier, then we totally have to give up our Sunday,
2611760	2616700	and Sunday's sometimes the day to get errands done, clean the house, or whatever, it really
2616700	2618400	would cut into the day.
2618400	2621400	So that's why we don't tape any of our Sundays, although we have been talking about doing
2621400	2623640	a one-off noon show.
2623640	2628080	We were going to tape at noon, so that way, especially the overseas listeners could tune
2628080	2629080	in live.
2629080	2630080	We just need to set a date for that.
2630080	2631080	We need to make that happen.
2631080	2632080	Well, let me know.
2632080	2635320	I've got two days off next week.
2635320	2636320	We'll see.
2636320	2640000	Two days off next week will work for me, but maybe later in the month or early April, sooner
2640000	2641000	rather than later.
2641000	2645880	We'll talk about that in our super secret forums where we discuss show thingies.
2645880	2648700	All right, so we'll make that happen for you guys.
2648700	2649700	Let's do one more voicemail.
2649700	2651360	I thought this one was pretty good.
2651360	2652360	Hello.
2652360	2653360	This is DSmaster25.
2653360	2654360	I'm a UJANA fan.
2654360	2655360	How dare you bash Hannah Montana?
2655360	2656360	Good Lord.
2656360	2657360	She's the best Sony fan in the world.
2657360	2658360	She's the best.
2658360	2666680	How dare you bash Hannah Montana, good Lord, she's the best Sony for once.
2666680	2668720	I'd like to see them get bashed.
2668720	2676200	Not my favorite pop star, Ole Miss Miley, okay, Hannah Montana.
2676200	2683720	Stop that here or I'm not watching any more shows.
2683720	2684720	Bye.
2684720	2690920	Well, I didn't realize we had legions of Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus fans that listen to
2690920	2695640	our show, so I think we need to take a moment to apologize to all the Hannah Montana fans
2695640	2699640	that listen to our program.
2699640	2707920	So we apologize dearly if you were offended by our comments on Hannah Montana, no we don't,
2707920	2711160	and we're really sorry we won't try to do it or we'll try not to do that again in the
2711160	2718000	future, and remember, hey, we're big fans of Hannah Montana's DS game, especially Footy
2718000	2719000	Monster.
2719000	2722720	But don't listen to him, it's not because it's a good music game, he just secretly really
2722720	2733240	loves Hannah Montana.
2733240	2737560	I just love the chat lighting up here, DDR Dollar Bill, what the fuck is this?
2737560	2742360	The fuck is this trash, Frisbee, why do people actually like her?
2742360	2746160	DDR Dollar Bill, I've never even heard her.
2746160	2753000	Is that what's popular?
2753000	2755800	Leave Hannah Alone, how was that voicemail?
2755800	2763560	Leave Hannah Alone, I get it, doing the whole Britney thing, yeah, please, back to gaming
2763560	2764560	please.
2764560	2771040	So this I'm sure is a shocker to everybody, but guess what, 2KMarin is actually working
2771040	2780320	on Bioshock 2, and they have peg day, I don't know, forecasted release date of quarter four
2780320	2782500	2009.
2782500	2791340	So Christmas 2009, you'll be playing Bioshock 2, hooray!
2791340	2801760	That's shocking, what, Bioshock 2 is coming out, I am so shocked, beyond belief, I would
2801760	2811280	have never guessed, you know what, EA is working on Madden 2009, and after that Madden 2010,
2811280	2815040	but it makes me wonder though, aren't you violating an NDA by saying that, might be,
2815040	2817720	but you know what makes me kind of wonder, because you know how it's like Madden 08,
2817720	2822680	or Madden 09, what are they going to do, Madden 10, maybe, why not, it's going to have Madden
2822680	2823680	2010.
2823680	2829240	Are these things really worth losing sleep about, or wasting time on an internet radio
2829240	2830240	program talking about?
2830240	2835520	I don't know, it's like the whole, you know, Y2K, but with Madden numbers, something's
2835520	2840840	going to happen, it's going to like open a rift or something, we'll see what happens.
2840840	2845760	Hey, here's another series that keeps on going, Guilty Gear!
2845760	2849800	Guilty Gear 2 Overture is coming out, but it's not the same type of Guilty Gear you
2849800	2854240	might be thinking of, it's coming out this fall for the Xbox 360, it's a tactical action
2854240	2855240	game.
2855240	2859040	Now it's like 3D, it takes all these characters you might know from the Guilty Gear, which
2859040	2863760	by the way is a 2D fighting game, and now they're going to be in a 3D action strategy
2863760	2869600	type of game, so it works so well for Soul Calibur, when it went to Soul Calibur Legends,
2869600	2870600	why not?
2870600	2871600	I've played it actually.
2871600	2872600	Really?
2872600	2873600	Yes.
2873600	2874600	What do you think?
2874600	2882640	I think it's going to be a Japanese account on Xbox Live, but it's okay, it's very similar
2882640	2888360	to like Dynasty Warriors on 99 Nights, but in the Guilty Gear universe.
2888360	2893360	I actually kind of liked 99 Nights for a little bit, and then it got a little old to me.
2893360	2897420	It's very similar to that, like you've got enemies you kill, and checkpoints you get
2897420	2902840	to, and you take them over, and that kind of stuff, definitely not a fighting game if
2902840	2905600	that's what you're expecting.
2905600	2906600	It's okay.
2906600	2910600	I just wish a lot of these things when they come to new systems, you know what, people
2910600	2914660	just like fighting games, so just release Guilty Gear as a fighting game, but they did
2914660	2919760	do that already on the Wii, so at least they get it for some systems, so it's just, others
2919760	2924280	are just trying something a little different, so more power to them I guess, trying to innovate
2924280	2928920	SNK, come on.
2928920	2932720	Well I don't know, I think I'll probably just end up passing on this game, maybe it's just
2932720	2933720	Sony.
2933720	2939600	Well, other people who said pass were actually Microsoft.
2939600	2945320	There was a rumor going around, especially since Sony, one of the Sony executives told
2945320	2951000	the Financial Times that Sony was in talks with Microsoft about offering them a Blu-ray
2951000	2956320	drive for the Xbox 360, but Aaron Greenberg, who's their group product manager for Xbox
2956320	2963360	360 said, nuh-uh, no, to quote, Xbox is not currently in talks with Sony or the Blu-ray
2963360	2968280	association to integrate Blu-ray into the Xbox experience.
2968280	2975120	That's a neat way to phrase it, the Xbox experience, but he did go on to say though that right
2975120	2983800	now Xbox 360 is the only console offering digital distribution of entertainment content.
2983800	2986360	We don't really know how long they're gonna be the only ones that does that, seeing that
2986360	2996680	Sony owns a movie company, but hey, a bunch of us who lucked out the tail end of that
2996680	3004560	and picked up on those cheap HD DVD players, hey, I even got five free HD DVDs.
3004560	3006600	The Xbox experience.
3006600	3007600	I know, that's so cool.
3007600	3010600	You know what the Xbox Live experience is?
3010600	3015640	Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit, fuck, gay, gay, fuck, fuck.
3015640	3019200	That's the Xbox Live experience right there.
3019200	3021120	There's lots of other words in there, too, I don't feel like repeating.
3021120	3024840	So what part of the Xbox experience is the Red Ring of Death?
3024840	3028520	Is that the fun part?
3028520	3030600	I mean, just wondering.
3030600	3034760	I did think that was a witty retort, though, that the Xbox does not need a Blu-ray drive
3034760	3036560	because they have downloadable movies.
3036560	3037560	So ha.
3037560	3038560	And they're already high-definition.
3038560	3045200	Yeah, here's a little problem with that logic, though, folks, and anyone that actually watches
3045200	3050320	a lot of pay-per-view stuff knows, movies don't come out on street date on that service,
3050320	3056840	usually it's a month later, so if you want to watch it day one, Blu-ray, well, hopefully
3056840	3063800	Blu-ray is the only way to go on that stuff, or you can watch it on DVD, I guess.
3063800	3069760	That's the angle they should work on that shit, but who really cares, I mean, come on.
3069760	3078480	I think that them accepting Blu-ray right now into their experience is sort of like
3078480	3083960	admitting some sort of defeat to Sony in some respect.
3083960	3085520	We ain't talking to those bitches.
3085520	3087080	Like, uh-uh.
3087080	3089280	I don't care what they have, we don't want their shit.
3089280	3093400	Yeah, I mean, it would look kind of silly for Microsoft to kind of endorse a Sony product
3093400	3097520	like that, but I would think that in the next Microsoft system, they're going to have to
3097520	3101040	support Blu-ray somehow, I would think, but who knows, you know?
3101040	3105000	We don't play DVDs, you don't necessarily have to play movies to be a console that succeeds.
3105000	3107040	Hey, they can always do the Dreamcast path.
3107040	3111640	They can always put HD DVD drives in there and use that as the format for the system,
3111640	3116800	because who says that they have to stop making discs for it, I mean, even though Toshiba
3116800	3121800	has stopped making them, but still, at the same time, who makes UMDs, you know?
3121800	3125640	Wouldn't that seem like a step backwards if Microsoft in their next system put an HD DVD
3125640	3126640	drive in them?
3126640	3130760	It'd be hard to copy them if there's no HD DVD drives out there, now would it?
3130760	3131760	Interesting thought.
3131760	3135740	I suppose you have this format already built up in some movie, well, it'd be interesting,
3135740	3137520	but I don't know, I just don't see it happening.
3137520	3141120	It'd be akin to using the, like I was bringing up with the Dreamcast, it'd be akin to using
3141120	3148960	the Giga discs, and you know how long it took them to crack those.
3148960	3153600	One cool thing, though, that is entertainment related, and I guess download content, new
3153600	3155600	islands coming to Burnout Paradise.
3155600	3160940	A bunch of new stuff that you'll be able to play and drive your cars through and crash
3160940	3161940	through and stuff.
3161940	3166280	In fact, actually, you can kind of see some of what's going to be available on that in
3166280	3171600	the game right now, because there's actually bridges that are being worked on and constructed,
3171600	3173640	I guess, in the game.
3173640	3177660	So later on, what they're going to do is have a free download, yes, because these islands
3177660	3184680	are going to be free, and you'll be able to expand your experience on Burnout Paradise.
3184680	3189080	There are also going to be some new cars available as well, those are not free.
3189080	3190080	But those are optional.
3190080	3191080	Interesting.
3191080	3193240	Who really needs extra cars when there's a lot in the game, anyways?
3193240	3195920	I would think, now I don't know, I'm not a hardcore racing fan, but I would think the
3195920	3198720	new areas are more of a perk than a new car.
3198720	3199720	Yeah.
3199720	3200720	Huh.
3200720	3201720	By a long shot.
3201720	3206520	Unless a new car is a super jetmobile that can jump 500 miles or something like that,
3206520	3208200	in which case I'll need that.
3208200	3211600	The new car is Sonic.
3211600	3218960	Just like, was it in Ridge Racer, where you have the hover cars and the rocket cars.
3218960	3221200	That's one thing about Ridge Racer, it's awesome.
3221200	3226960	Some rumors are abounding about Grand Theft Auto IV, and that is its new multiplayer modes.
3226960	3232200	Sixteen players and fifteen different modes in the game, this all coming from PlayStation
3232200	3236960	Magazine in Spain, a translation from that magazine.
3236960	3241320	And there it is, so supposedly it's going to be sixteen player modes, does that make
3241320	3242320	you pretty excited, Loki?
3242320	3243320	Oh hell yes.
3243320	3245880	I know you're very excited about, are you going to be able to network that many systems
3245880	3246880	at work?
3246880	3251000	We have five already, six if I get this other one working.
3251000	3252000	Jeez.
3252000	3253000	All right, very cool.
3253000	3258020	Although I'm not too optimistic about this sixth one, but five.
3258020	3264260	Some of the games from their translations, Hangman's News, Carjack City, Bomb Debase,
3264260	3271540	Mafia Work, Death Batch, Turf War, Cops and Crooks, Race, Dealbreaker, Free Mode.
3271540	3273640	We are going to, you know.
3273640	3275080	Does it sound legit to you?
3275080	3280280	I think it sounds legit, that stuff sounds very legit.
3280280	3283240	I can't wait to play this game, we're going to be playing this thing every day, dude.
3283240	3287880	And I don't know, we're just going to kick everyone's ass online, it'll be fun.
3287880	3290400	I hope the game sucks, just to spite you.
3290400	3294640	Yeah, too bad it's not going to happen.
3294640	3295640	We'll see.
3295640	3301240	Well, this actually makes me kind of happy, because everyone knows I'm a big Dreamcast
3301240	3302760	fan.
3302760	3311160	We are getting Mr. Driller online, a downloadable version that's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.
3311160	3315360	There's not a whole bunch of details on it right now, but it's been confirmed for a spring
3315360	3316880	release in Japan.
3316880	3321260	So hopefully we won't get it too much longer after, and it's Mr. Driller.
3321260	3322760	I'm sure we'll get it at the same time.
3322760	3327240	There hasn't really been any releases in Japan on Xbox Live Arcade that we haven't gotten
3327240	3329240	at the same time, as far as I'm aware.
3329240	3330880	Well, then even better.
3330880	3331880	I don't know.
3331880	3334480	It'll be a first, I guess.
3334480	3338880	Hitstun and Chat says, this looks just like Mr. Driller DS.
3338880	3343160	I wouldn't doubt that, it's Mr. Driller.
3343160	3350160	It probably does look like most versions of Mr. Driller, because it is Mr. Driller.
3350160	3352880	Mr. Driller's kind of cool.
3352880	3356800	It seems really easy at first, but there's a lot of depth to the puzzle in the game.
3356800	3359160	It's interesting.
3359160	3365120	A new version of the Wii's Twilight Hack, and that is the hack using Twilight Princess
3365120	3368980	to run homebrew code, has been made available.
3368980	3376320	It's version 0.1A3, and now what's kind of neat about it is that you'll be able to run
3376320	3382720	data off of SD memory cards using the SD memory card slot in the Wii system itself.
3382720	3389280	Prior to that, you'd have to have an SD Gecko or some sort of GameCube adapter to run it
3389280	3393640	off of SD memory cards, but now you can actually do it on the drive.
3393640	3395960	Right now, though, not many things supporting it.
3395960	3403120	Only game that actually works with it right now is a version of Tetris, but soon it will
3403120	3408160	be supporting a lot more things, but that's just kind of interesting that they have this
3408160	3412360	exploit in there, and I don't know if Nintendo will be able to fix it.
3412360	3414440	I'm sure it'll be in the next patch.
3414440	3418560	That loophole's going to get closed right up, but who knows?
3418560	3419560	Maybe they'll luck out.
3419560	3424120	Yeah, I know, it's worked out well for Sony so far.
3424120	3428200	Some folks that have not lucked out are folks that were looking forward to playing Army
3428200	3435360	of Two across different regions, because Army of Two apparently has region-locked online
3435360	3436360	play.
3436360	3440440	There's a very, very small little note in the manual for Army of Two.
3440440	3444760	Note, the online game modes in Army of Two are not cross-region compatible and is only
3444760	3447160	supported between PAL disks.
3447160	3450580	Of course, the PAL version's manual has that note in there, so if you were looking forward
3450580	3456120	to playing folks in Europe, if you're in the US, sorry, can't do it in Army of Two.
3456120	3461180	Some people are pretty pissed off about this, but in a way, I kind of wonder, is it maybe
3461180	3464960	because the lag is too great, because aren't these supposed to be some huge multiplayer
3464960	3468480	matches, and if you have one person that's far away like that, it would cause a tremendous
3468480	3469480	amount of lag?
3469480	3473160	They were saying it's just a save on server strain, because Army Two's going to be the
3473160	3477960	uber-awesome game or something, so you know.
3477960	3483160	I don't know, I still wish they would leave that option open, but maybe it's not the default
3483160	3487080	way to assign the players.
3487080	3491240	But if you really wanted to play against somebody in the UK or overseas or whatever, you should
3491240	3492240	be able to.
3492240	3496040	It's just EA, it's broken, whatever.
3496040	3500680	I hope this isn't a trend, that's all I have to say.
3500680	3504720	Well, I hope not.
3504720	3512680	For fans of PopCap, there's actually going to be a PopCap hits release, a second one
3512680	3520600	actually, that's going to have Heavy Weapon and Zuma on PS2 on a single disc.
3520600	3524280	So if you like to get your casual games, I imagine it's going to be dirt cheap.
3524280	3525280	20 bucks.
3525280	3526280	That's not bad.
3526280	3527280	$19.95.
3527280	3529040	That's about the same price you'd pay for them on Xbox Live.
3529040	3533680	Yeah, of course you can probably play them free online, but hey.
3533680	3535240	But then you don't get all those extra features.
3535240	3536240	That's true.
3536240	3538120	New boards, new puzzles, new everything.
3538120	3540560	I kind of liked Heavy Weapon, it was a fun game.
3540560	3543640	Zuma, Zuma, I'm a little burned out on Zuma.
3543640	3545000	I haven't played Zuma.
3545000	3548520	It's just fun, but I'm a little burned out on it, but Heavy Weapon was cool.
3548520	3549520	There you have it.
3549520	3551760	I like anything with weapon in the title.
3551760	3558920	All right, we're going to be opening the Skype line very soon for you guys, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3558920	3562680	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, that's going to be opening very soon.
3562680	3564960	I just want to read a couple of quick comments from chat.
3564960	3569840	Karpatkin is in chat, he has his own show, or co-host a show over on All Games, and I
3569840	3575160	happen to know because of that that he's in the UK and he says it has to do with P2P network
3575160	3582080	play, not servers in regards to Army of Two, so hmm, interesting.
3582080	3587240	Let's go to the phones, if you want to give us a call again, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username
3587240	3589240	on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
3589240	3592880	The phone lines are now open.
3592880	3593880	Give us a call.
3593880	3594880	We'll be waiting.
3594880	3597680	In the meantime, we have a, oh, we got a call.
3597680	3599000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3599000	3600000	Who's this?
3600000	3601000	Oh, hi.
3601000	3602000	This is RossdielUT.
3602000	3603000	Well, hello, RossdielUT.
3603000	3604000	What's on your mind?
3604000	3614080	Well, one thing, I want to go back to Microsoft's decision about not supporting Blu-ray and touting
3614080	3621960	their online service, I really think they're limiting their potential audience by doing
3621960	3623600	that, honestly.
3623600	3631400	You know, since, like it or not, a whole lot of Americans either can't or don't want to
3631400	3634720	download movies, especially on their shitty-ass DRM service.
3634720	3639960	Wait, wait, I've got to ask, what is it about Microsoft's service you don't like?
3639960	3644160	Well, I think I told you about what happened to me with my XBLA games.
3644160	3648880	Oh, when you had to send your thing back, you had to redownload them all and all that?
3648880	3652800	I had to redownload them again, then I had to, well, I didn't have to redownload them,
3652800	3658320	but the way the DRM works is that you can't access your content offline, like if your
3658320	3659560	internet goes on the fritz.
3659560	3660560	Right, that's right.
3660560	3661560	Okay.
3661560	3666760	I mean, I've heard common problems about that, and the same goes for movies, basically.
3666760	3674800	Well, movies, you don't even get to keep the movies, you can only watch them once.
3674800	3678880	And no, Rama, the PlayStation Network isn't anywhere near as draconian.
3678880	3684680	You can activate up to five systems, and it's not anywhere near as hard to get things revalidated.
3684680	3688040	Okay, I've got to read the comment from chat that you responded to for the sake of our
3688040	3689840	podcast listeners who don't see chat.
3689840	3693120	Rama said, shitty, yes, but it's better than the PlayStation Network.
3693120	3697360	All right, so Microsoft's not doing Blu-ray.
3697360	3701000	You think that's a decision that makes sense, or you think it's going to hurt them in the
3701000	3702520	long run?
3702520	3704160	I think it's going to hurt them in the long run.
3704160	3709520	I think what we forget, being in cities, you know, you're in Sacramento, I'm in Miami,
3709520	3717000	I'm sure a lot of the people in the chat are from decent-sized cities, is that large parts
3717000	3724240	of the country, especially the further west you go until you get to California, broadband
3724240	3727240	isn't as easily available, or it's very expensive.
3727240	3733120	I mean, not only that, but most people are going to have common customer-grade DSLs.
3733120	3739360	They're not going to be paying $80 a month for the high-end stuff, you know what I mean?
3739360	3743240	But don't you think that in those places, those are the places where Blockbuster and
3743240	3747840	Hollywood Video and Movie Gallery and all those places are still doing well?
3747840	3751680	Well, they're still doing well here in Miami.
3751680	3754840	There's a Blockbuster right in front of my house.
3754840	3756640	That place is always doing great business.
3756640	3758640	They're still doing well in cities.
3758640	3763120	You still see the mom-and-pop stores anymore.
3763120	3767080	I used to work, my very first job was at a mom-and-pop video game store, and they went
3767080	3768360	under years ago.
3768360	3773480	Well, that has more to do with the chains, you know, bullying everybody out than anything
3773480	3774480	else.
3774480	3777240	That's a whole other issue we could spend a whole show doing.
3777240	3782320	I'll just say, though, we had one thing that Hollywood and Blockbuster and all them didn't
3782320	3783320	have.
3783320	3784320	We rented porn.
3784320	3786760	So, you know, how they went out of business on the road.
3786760	3790240	You still see places that run porn, West Coast and things like that, you know, chains here
3790240	3792480	in the Southeast.
3792480	3799160	But when you go download only, you're limiting yourself because, let's face it, if you want
3799160	3810280	to download something other than a damn act up to saying it pretty much, I mean, one megabit
3810280	3812080	connection is 40 bucks.
3812080	3816880	That's not going to get you a high definition movie in a reasonable amount of time.
3816880	3821520	I go to Xbox Live Arcade, it takes like an hour to download a movie.
3821520	3828680	The downloading thing doesn't do a lot for our need-it-now kind of culture, the self-gratification
3828680	3830120	culture that we live in.
3830120	3834320	The reason why Blockbuster and all that do well is because when somebody thinks, I want
3834320	3837200	to rent a movie, they want to rent a movie tonight, now.
3837200	3838640	They don't want to wait for Netflix.
3838640	3840160	They don't want to wait to download it.
3840160	3841160	They want to go get it now.
3841160	3849000	Even Netflix, I mean, if you keep a steady queue, you always have a movie or two there.
3849000	3852720	But what if the one that's at your house isn't necessarily, and don't get me wrong, I love
3852720	3856040	Netflix, I'm just being devil's advocate, what if the one at your house right now isn't
3856040	3861000	the one that you end up wanting to watch when you're talking about with friends, maybe you're
3861000	3864000	talking about an old classic 80s movie that nobody has?
3864000	3869240	At the end of the day, you get in the car and you go to Blockbuster.
3869240	3874280	You get in the car or if you're lucky enough like I am, you walk across the street and
3874280	3878080	there's your Blockbuster, you pick up your movie.
3878080	3881060	With Blu-ray, you're going to be able to do that.
3881060	3885360	In the coming months, we already have Blu-ray for rental in my place and you're going to
3885360	3886360	see that all over the place.
3886360	3889760	We're going to see Blu-ray rentals all over the place and it's just going to take over.
3889760	3890760	Well, we'll see.
3890760	3893200	Ross, to you, too, we've got to wrap up.
3893200	3894200	We're getting towards time.
3894200	3897320	Any other last minute thoughts?
3897320	3902240	One last minute thing, I'm surprised you guys didn't talk about the NPDs this month.
3902240	3905400	What specifically about them?
3905400	3914040	The PS3 outsold the 360 for the second month in a row, selling 281,000 units versus 255,
3914040	3917120	but what really surprised me was how well the PS2 did.
3917120	3919600	I don't know if you saw this.
3919600	3922340	It sold 352,000.
3922340	3924160	That's pretty typical for the PS2.
3924160	3925160	It's actually the matching.
3925160	3929080	I was about to say, doesn't everybody have it?
3929080	3931080	It's still the spare bedroom system.
3931080	3934240	It's the system you buy for the younger kids so they can feel cool because they have a
3934240	3935880	video gaming system in their room.
3935880	3941080	I think most folks like us that listen to programs like this, we all have PS2s at this
3941080	3942080	point.
3942080	3943080	It's not just us.
3943080	3946800	The system has already sold 50 million in America alone.
3946800	3951600	And the only reason the PS3 outsold the 360 is because the 360 is in a shortage right
3951600	3952600	now.
3952600	3953600	Oh, please.
3953600	3956640	Every store I go to there's a ton of 360s.
3956640	3957640	Microsoft is making a shortage.
3957640	3961320	Well, I know because I talked to Microsoft that there's a fucking shortage going on right
3961320	3964600	now and they, in fact, commented, yeah, there is a shortage going on right now.
3964600	3968280	We know that the PlayStation 3 is going to outsell us this month and sure enough then
3968280	3969920	that's not just damage control.
3969920	3975600	It's not damage control because they're going to have enough, oh right, yeah, okay, I'm
3975600	3979240	sure all of a sudden Blu-ray wins now and they're going to sell billions of systems
3979240	3980240	and they'll be the number one.
3980240	3982980	Well, actually I was kind of thinking like couldn't the possibility because now that
3982980	3986520	Blu-ray has won the war, so to speak, maybe that moves some PS3s.
3986520	3987520	Not going to fucking happen.
3987520	3991680	I bet you anything in April that the 360 is definitely going to outsell a PS3 and buy
3991680	3992680	a lot.
3992680	3993680	What kind of bet?
3993680	3994680	Shut up.
3994680	3995680	I don't know.
3995680	3996680	It's worth a try.
3996680	4003840	It's not so much just Blu-ray but ever since we saw the system go down to the 399 with
4003840	4007320	the 40 gig, you know, the sales have picked up.
4007320	4009720	Yeah, and Sony is really confident on that.
4009720	4010720	You know why?
4010720	4013440	Because now they're removing the Blu-ray movie that comes with it because they're,
4013440	4015320	guess what, fuckers will buy your own Blu-ray.
4015320	4018480	All right, I got to wrap it up, you guys, I'm supposed to keep it in the four minutes
4018480	4023000	and we're on seven, but Ross Steel, UT, thank you for your perspective as always.
4023000	4024000	Take care, buddy.
4024000	4025000	Okay, bye-bye.
4025000	4026000	Bye-bye.
4026000	4030000	You know, I do like this comment from SSJ100Matt in chat, he says, fact, HDTV needs to be the
4030000	4032200	standard before Blu-ray can really take off.
4032200	4033200	I agree.
4033200	4037080	But in 2009 with that whole digital TV switchover, I see there's a distinct possibility.
4037080	4039320	I think this holiday season is huge for HDTVs.
4039320	4040320	Yeah, exactly.
4040320	4044140	This holiday is going to be awesome and, you know, but the fact is there is a shortage
4044140	4048600	on systems right now, I know that from, you know, working a retail standpoint and from
4048600	4049600	Microsoft actually calling.
4049600	4052600	All right, all right, let's go to a new call, breathe in.
4052600	4056680	All right, new call, hi, you're on Horse House Radio, who's this?
4056680	4058680	Hi, this is Act Deft.
4058680	4060360	Hi, Act Deft, what's on your mind?
4060360	4061360	Hello.
4061360	4064160	Oh, I just wanted to comment about video games live.
4064160	4069640	Oh, that's right, you got to go and the concert just happened in Mexico recently, right?
4069640	4070640	Yeah.
4070640	4071640	And how was it?
4071640	4077400	Oh, it was so fucking epic and amazing.
4077400	4080520	It was everything I expected and more.
4080520	4087400	It was a pretty amazing, how do you say it, show, yeah.
4087400	4091680	Describe for us like the best part.
4091680	4097800	I seriously can't choose the best part, though if I had to choose a song they played, maybe
4097800	4105840	it was the Kingdom Hearts theme song, sampling clean, an orchestra, oh, it was so fucking
4105840	4106840	amazing.
4106840	4107840	Nice.
4107840	4111640	You sound like you were blown away.
4111640	4112640	How was this?
4112640	4114520	Yeah, I almost cried at that part.
4114520	4116360	How was the audience?
4116360	4117620	Was there a lot of people there?
4117620	4119840	Was it a very full house or?
4119840	4130680	Well, not a full house, though approximately like 2,000 people and maybe, well, the Bull
4130680	4140920	Ring maybe has 5,000 people capacity and it was like 2,000 approximately, more or less.
4140920	4145080	So it was, there was a lot of people, though it was not full.
4145080	4146760	Okay, not too bad though.
4146760	4151500	Sounds like a pretty filled up crowd, if nothing else.
4151500	4154380	Did they give an indication that they might come back?
4154380	4158960	This might just be the first of several shows in Mexico?
4158960	4165920	They said in a conference before that they may or most probably will come next year again.
4165920	4166920	Oh, nice.
4166920	4168560	I bet you're excited about that.
4168560	4170560	Yeah, pretty excited.
4170560	4173920	Any advice you would have to give to folks that are going to be attending future video
4173920	4175920	game live shows?
4175920	4183440	Pretty much that any seat in the concert will give you a pretty good view, though on the
4183440	4186760	front will be a pretty good show.
4186760	4189160	All right, very awesome.
4189160	4193480	Well, I'm glad to hear you had a really good time at the show and you know what's funny?
4193480	4195320	I still have yet to see video games live.
4195320	4198080	I just keep missing it every time it's in town, like something else is going on.
4198080	4199080	It's sad.
4199080	4200080	I really want to see it.
4200080	4202200	I saw The Dear Friends, which is similar.
4202200	4206160	I saw the Final Fantasy based one a while ago, but I will definitely catch video games
4206160	4210080	live next time I can, especially because I hear nothing but good things about it, so
4210080	4211080	I'll have to check it out.
4211080	4214640	Akdefta, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4214640	4217680	Just an article on Joystick.
4217680	4221520	It was a report on Mexican game industry.
4221520	4230200	They said that by 2010, the gaming industry in Mexico will increase by approximately I
4230200	4234520	think 10 million, 10 billion, excuse me.
4234520	4243360	So apparently it's going to be increasing, though I find it kind of ironic that even
4243360	4250280	though the analysts think that it's going to increase in the economy, Mexico is one
4250280	4259640	of the leading markets in the world of piracy, games, music, movies, you name it.
4259640	4271120	So I don't know how the industry will manage to beat that.
4271120	4275080	Interesting perspective from somebody who's actually there in Mexico.
4275080	4277480	Sometimes we read these stories and we don't really know what is.
4277480	4282520	I guess my question for you is what is the gaming, actually let me ask you this, have
4282520	4285960	you ever visited the US?
4285960	4286960	Yes I have.
4286960	4291440	Have you been able to kind of compare like the availability and the prevalence of gaming
4291440	4295920	here in the US versus Mexico?
4295920	4304020	Well, like in the United States you have GameStop, Baby Games, many video game stores here.
4304020	4312800	We only have maybe one or two game stores and they're only located on the southern region
4312800	4314920	of the country.
4314920	4324280	Most of the stores that carry games are like supermarkets like Walmart, for example, and
4324280	4329480	they don't have a great library of games, so it's pretty difficult to find a game you
4329480	4330480	like.
4330480	4332860	Where do you get your games from?
4332860	4339160	I actually get my games from Sam's Club because they are pretty cheap and they have a great
4339160	4340160	library there.
4340160	4346720	So I'm kind of liking that, but anywhere else I go I cannot find anything.
4346720	4354120	So I actually have to get my games from online or I have to ask friends that go to the United
4354120	4355880	States to get them from me.
4355880	4359680	To get them from you, well thankfully they run on the same televisions and pretty much
4359680	4362160	the Xboxes you get there are the same ones here so you don't have to worry about those
4362160	4364560	region-based issues.
4364560	4367120	Always interesting to hear from our listeners in other countries and kind of hear about
4367120	4368560	the way the scene is there.
4368560	4369560	So thanks so much.
4369560	4373840	We've got to let you go active because we're running out of time, but thank you very much
4373840	4374840	for the call.
4374840	4376360	Yeah, thank you too.
4376360	4377360	Take care.
4377360	4379880	We'll do one more call.
4379880	4381200	We'll see who gets through here.
4381200	4382200	We'll do some last minute stories.
4382200	4384640	Do you have any last minute stories for us, Loki, when we get to that?
4384640	4385640	Yeah.
4385640	4386640	All right, sounds good.
4386640	4388320	Why don't you go ahead and read us the first one because...
4388320	4389320	Oh, no, never mind.
4389320	4390320	We've got a call.
4390320	4392240	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4392240	4393240	Who's this?
4393240	4395520	Hello, Orange Lounge.
4395520	4403640	This is the, what is it, the Norwegian, no, Norwegian, Swedish owl known as Akkeriper.
4403640	4406720	Well, hello, Akkeriper.
4406720	4408800	I see you in chat right now.
4408800	4410840	I remember you calling in before.
4410840	4412480	How are you doing?
4412480	4413720	I'm doing just fine.
4413720	4418920	I'm, well, what, doing my wow drugs as usual, so...
4418920	4419920	What time is it?
4419920	4423680	It's got to be like, what, four or five in the morning over there?
4423680	4433400	It's like, what is it, five, five to, ah, I don't know, damn, I'm lost.
4433400	4435500	It's around like five o'clock in the morning.
4435500	4437880	He's up so late, he lost complete track of time.
4437880	4438880	That's dedication.
4438880	4439880	I love it.
4439880	4440880	Well, what's on your mind?
4440880	4441880	What do we owe the phone call tonight?
4441880	4443920	Yeah, well, what is it?
4443920	4451160	I'm in the plans of buying a PSP for some weird reason, and I don't even know why, but
4451160	4458720	the reason is that I want to do a home brew on it, and I try to do some read up on it
4458720	4464920	on the web, and I'm completely lost on that front for some weird reason.
4464920	4474680	I don't even know why, but, well, and since, what is it, since Loki has made his home brew
4474680	4482640	PSP, I think, if I remember right, I want to ask him, what is, what is, does he have
4482640	4485560	any kind of tip or so, what is so?
4485560	4486560	Good question.
4486560	4489360	What is kind of the best way, if you're interested in doing some home brew on the PSP, what's
4489360	4492160	the best way to do that if you don't already own a PSP?
4492160	4496520	It's not very easy, because, especially with the new slim PSPs now, if you're getting one
4496520	4501620	of the fatter ones, it's easy to do it, because all you have to really do is, you know, up
4501620	4507020	downgrade the, you know, using any sort of exploit, either the Pandora's battery or
4507020	4509660	Grand Theft Auto, or Let me, let me say this first, I think part
4509660	4513360	of the reason it's so complicated is because of the fact that Sony keeps patching it with
4513360	4517880	every exploit that's found, it seems like there's 50 different ways to do it out there,
4517880	4519800	so Well, yeah, and really
4519800	4526840	One of the, pardon me, one of the reasons also is that there is actually a place where
4526840	4537320	you can buy a home brew enabled PSP for, what is it, like 2000 Swedish crowns, and you can
4537320	4551320	also buy an standard vanilla PSP for like 1600, and well, since I'm a sheep bastard,
4551320	4556800	I have the intention of just buying the vanilla, and then try to make some home brew version.
4556800	4559420	I don't blame you, I don't blame you for being a PSP.
4559420	4563240	There's guys online to do the slim PSP, but what it's going to really take is you need
4563240	4569320	to have someone else that has one of the original PSPs, or has already made a Pandora's battery
4569320	4573800	for the slim one, and basically what you do, you have to have the old one to create the
4573800	4579120	Pandora's battery, then you patch it for the slim one, and then you run it on your slim.
4579120	4583520	Should he try his luck and try to go buy a used PSP?
4583520	4588080	I would think the cheapest way to do it, try your luck in buying a used PSP, because a
4588080	4592120	used PSP is likely to have an older firmware still on it, depending on how long it's been
4592120	4596240	on the shelf, and that way you can make sure you get a fat PSP, too, and then you can use
4596240	4604320	either the Grand Theft Auto exploit, which still works, or this Pandora's battery thing,
4604320	4609040	but that's an extra cost to it, isn't it, because you have to buy a whole other battery?
4609040	4610040	Sort of.
4610040	4611040	You can buy the...
4611040	4614720	Okay, really quickly, what is the Pandora's battery?
4614720	4619120	Pandora's battery is basically you're running firmware or actual code off the battery, because
4619120	4623960	the battery itself actually has a little bit of data on it, and so what that does is it
4623960	4629640	pops it into a developer's mode and drops the firmware to whatever.
4629640	4636440	It basically resets the whole PSP, and what they've done is kind of bootstrapped a downgrader
4636440	4642720	with this Pandora's battery, so it's allowed them to drop it down to 1.5, and then once
4642720	4648120	you have 1.5, you can up it to a custom firmware or something like that.
4648120	4652880	It's not easy, and it's pretty confusing, but there are guides that take you step by
4652880	4654960	step on how to do it.
4654960	4661760	QJNet has a pretty good guide and stuff, or at least they have links to find a guide like
4661760	4662760	that.
4662760	4665240	I was just going to ask, are there any sites that you would recommend?
4665240	4674520	Because it sounds like probably like PSP Hacks or psp.qj.net, or I think pspupdates.qj.net,
4674520	4675880	they would have links.
4675880	4679280	That's where I found mine, but it's been a long time since I did it.
4679280	4683640	Once you do get a custom firmware on there, it's pretty easy, because now the stuff that
4683640	4691400	they put out, I guess it's the M33 firmwares, they're completely easy to upgrade.
4691400	4698040	In fact, now they've got a built-in where you can just run an update via Wi-Fi and update
4698040	4702080	it over the web just like you would a normal psp.
4702080	4706760	It's pretty simple once you've got that working to get a homebrew on there.
4706760	4709520	Just getting it to that is pretty hard.
4709520	4714720	Luckily, I had two psps, so I just used my old one to create the Pandora's Battery to
4714720	4718720	do it.
4718720	4725920	What is more, in that way, that was just about what we were going to ask also.
4725920	4734360	Since you can actually buy one with custom firmware already on it, how will it work when
4734360	4737920	you're going to have to do updates and stuff?
4737920	4751720	Well, I think I know the name of the game, but not LocoRoco, but the other one that's
4751720	4752720	coming.
4752720	4753720	Padawan?
4753720	4759560	Yeah, what you're going to have to do, obviously you can't use any updates that are on UMD
4759560	4764440	disk, because that will corrupt your firmware, but what you're going to have to do is wait
4764440	4766840	for them to release these updates.
4766840	4771640	But luckily though, most of the firmwares are cracked within a day or two at the most.
4771640	4774560	Here's kind of the sad part though, is that if you want to do homebrew on the psp, it's
4774560	4778840	at the point now where you have to be pretty on top of it to do it.
4778840	4782320	Loki, and here's something to consider, is that yeah, Loki might be a sort of homebrew
4782320	4785200	psp expert, but Loki, how many psps do you own?
4785200	4786200	Two.
4786200	4788040	And one is for homebrew and one is for current stuff, right?
4788040	4789040	Or something like that?
4789040	4790040	No.
4790040	4791040	Oh, I thought that's how you did it.
4791040	4792880	One I just don't use, and it's collecting dust, and it's one of the older ones, and the
4792880	4796600	other one is I can play new games on it, and I can play homebrew on it.
4796600	4797600	Oh wow.
4797600	4798960	It's the Slims, yeah.
4798960	4801360	And you did the Pandora's Battery trick with it.
4801360	4802360	Yeah.
4802360	4803360	Oh, okay.
4803360	4804360	It was a pain in the ass though.
4804360	4809320	It was really not fun, and luckily I had like an extra battery I bought, because I bought
4809320	4813920	a charger, a new charger for it, and it came with a battery, so I used that battery.
4813920	4818680	In fact, I think I still have my Pandora's Battery, but the thing is, also when you're
4818680	4823640	doing the Slim, the patched one does not fit on a 32 meg memory stick, so you need to make
4823640	4828080	sure you have at least one that's like 128 to be able to put the data on it, because
4828080	4832360	you have to have a memory stick and a battery that are basically linked together, and so
4832360	4836560	what will happen is when you pop that battery in, it will run that data that's on that memory
4836560	4838480	stick for you.
4838480	4839480	It's really weird.
4839480	4844000	Yeah, well, a memory card's not going to be a problem, since I actually have two memory
4844000	4849760	sticks, and I actually plan to buy it on an 8 gig version if I'm going to buy a PSP, so.
4849760	4850760	Yeah.
4850760	4851760	That's fine.
4851760	4856240	So why say another battery or something, I mean, what will happen is once you've created
4856240	4863120	as a Pandora's Battery, it will, you can update your, or I guess back up your battery data
4863120	4867200	so that you can drop that battery back to a normal battery after it's done.
4867200	4870520	It's kind of complicated, there's a lot of stuff on the internet, unfortunately I don't
4870520	4877200	remember exactly the steps to go to do it, but the information's definitely out there.
4877200	4883320	I was going to say, if you're really lazy, you might be able to find a Pandora's Battery
4883320	4884320	on eBay.
4884320	4889880	One last question, though, about playing with a PSP Slim on a big screen, how does that
4889880	4891760	work, or something?
4891760	4898160	Well, the Slim ones, you just need to buy a cable to do it, and pretty much it just
4898160	4900320	involves you plugging it in.
4900320	4903000	The only problem is you're tethered to your TV, so.
4903000	4906320	You need an extension or something like that, I guess?
4906320	4911880	Any extension cable for component or composite will work, it's just you're still tethered
4911880	4916680	to via a cord, although now they have a thing where they're going to come out with a remote
4916680	4921440	dock if they're watching UMD movies or something like that that you can control it with a remote,
4921440	4924760	but still, though, it's going to be tethered to your TV.
4924760	4928960	Okay, Ripper, you're right, I've got to wrap things up, but do you have any other quick
4928960	4930520	final thoughts?
4930520	4934920	Nah, not that of so.
4934920	4943400	I'm just a bit annoyed, just waiting for a 2.4 patch to come out, since apparently you
4943400	4951120	can start downloading the whole thing, so on Tuesday or Wednesday it's going to apparently
4951120	4952620	be patched to 2.4.
4952620	4957000	The background downloader is already active, my 2.4 is downloaded, I'm pretty sure it'll
4957000	4959960	go live either this Tuesday or next Tuesday, but we'll see, and of course we're talking
4959960	4962080	about Warcraft if you're going anywhere.
4962080	4965520	Hey, real quick, you said you were from Sweden?
4965520	4966520	Yeah.
4966520	4969480	Now, you know what I love most about Sweden?
4969480	4971920	I don't know, our royal house?
4971920	4974160	No, no.
4974160	4975160	ABBA.
4975160	4976160	Oh, yeah.
4976160	4977160	Oh, yeah.
4977160	4978160	Don't stop.
4978160	4979160	I love the music.
4979160	4980160	All right.
4980160	4981160	I seriously got to let you go.
4981160	4982160	Yeah, well, I can't say.
4982160	4983160	No, I know.
4983160	4984160	That was how many years ago, but it's timeless.
4984160	4985160	Yeah, I did.
4985160	4986160	All right.
4986160	4987160	Have a good one, buddy.
4987160	4988160	Thank you.
4988160	4989160	Bye.
4989160	4990160	Bye.
4990160	4991160	Bye.
4991160	4992160	Bye, buddy.
4992160	4993160	Thank you.
4993160	4994160	That's it.
4994160	4995160	Same to you too.
4995160	4996160	Bye.
4996160	4997160	And of course the chat room's all, not ABBA.
4997160	5005360	Since J-100 Matt says Rob went there, oh yes, I went there.
5005360	5007040	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
5007040	5008280	We got to wrap up the show.
5008280	5009280	Mm-hmm.
5009280	5010280	Good times.
5010280	5011280	I'm sorry, Jamie.
5011280	5012920	But ABBA, Jamie, ABBA.
5012920	5016760	I remember when you were all antsy about getting to see Mamma Mia.
5016760	5018840	Hey, the movie is coming out.
5018840	5019840	I'll tell you what, I'm excited.
5019840	5020840	All right.
5020840	5021840	I can't wait to see it.
5021840	5022840	All right.
5022840	5023840	We got to wrap up.
5023840	5024840	Let's get everybody's final thought.
5024840	5026320	Dark Soccer, you got like your keys in your hand.
5026320	5027320	You're ready to roll, Dark Soccer.
5027320	5029960	No, I'm trying to get to my thing so I can give you my cage match song.
5029960	5030960	No, I'm kidding.
5030960	5032080	What's your final thought today?
5032080	5036260	Reject false icons and buy me a fucking computer, buddy.
5036260	5038040	My final thought is heartburn sucks.
5038040	5040120	Loki, your final thought?
5040120	5048280	My final thought is, I don't know, I got to add people in Smash Brothers Brawl, I guess.
5048280	5052520	And Dark Tetsuya needs to add me on his Wii console so I can send him levels because he
5052520	5056040	was bitchy and they couldn't download any because he doesn't have an SD memory card,
5056040	5057360	which are dirt cheap by now.
5057360	5058760	I should let you know.
5058760	5062040	By the way, speaking of custom levels, I heard you broke some type of record or something?
5062040	5066160	Well, I didn't break a record, but my level is in the top 20 downloadable levels for...
5066160	5067160	Ooh!
5067160	5068160	Out of how many levels?
5068160	5069160	20?
5069160	5070160	No, quite a few, actually.
5070160	5071160	Wow, good for you.
5071160	5072160	Congrats.
5072160	5073920	Are you selling the show somehow?
5073920	5076000	I made one and no one liked that level.
5076000	5077000	Oh, dope.
5077000	5078000	What's the trick?
5078000	5084040	The trick is to make stuff that looks like other things from pixel art type stuff, levels
5084040	5085040	that look like...
5085040	5089440	Mine was the question block level, so it looks like a question block from Mario Brothers.
5089440	5090440	Gotcha.
5090440	5091440	All right.
5091440	5093240	I have one other final thought for you guys.
5093240	5096760	Oh, but before we get to that, I just want to say thank you so much, as always, for tuning
5096760	5099680	into and downloading and supporting independent podcasting.
5099680	5103440	Remember, if you like Orange Launch Radio, all we ask, tell a friend or two about our
5103440	5104440	show.
5104440	5105440	Spread the word.
5105440	5107240	It's how we slowly take over the world.
5107240	5114240	And I'll leave you with one last final, final thought, and then say good night.
5114240	5124080	Good night.
5124080	5125720	That music will never, ever get old.
5125720	5126720	Erasure did a good cover.
5126720	5131200	I don't care what you say.
5131200	5132200	Thank you guys again.
5132200	5133200	Have a great week.
5133200	5153840	See you next time here on Orange Launch Radio.
