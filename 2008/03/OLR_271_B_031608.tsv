487	19088	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19966	24309	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 16th of 2008.
24369	24849	Happy St.
24890	27511	Patrick's Day Eve to those of you out there.
27551	33235	Don't forget to wear green tomorrow or don't forget to wear green three days ago if you're listening on the podcast because you guys get a little late.
33275	39060	But hey, that's just part of the perks of listening live to us every Sunday night when we tape over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
39080	41441	We have a chat room full of people who are doing that right now.
41962	48086	And for all you guys, whether it be live, syndicated, or podcast, we're going to get back into the gaming news, aren't we, Loki?
48894	55717	Yes, and if you live in the United States, you're probably looking forward to some pretty cool games coming out into the arcade, like Tekken 6.
57358	61500	You're never going to get to play Tekken 6 because it's never coming to the arcade in the U.S.
62661	67663	So if you want to play it in the arcade, got to go to Japan or hopefully find an arcade that will import it for you.
69004	69704	So that kind of sucked.
70124	71925	Of which there are a few of those kind of places.
71985	74366	Like I think of that one place we always used to go to in L.A.
75067	75287	Yeah.
75307	76547	What was that, Arcade Infinity?
76567	77248	Was that what it was called?
77468	77608	Yeah.
77935	81738	Apparently there are a few places that are importing them.
81758	90385	There's a place in Houston, I guess, that also has a Tekken 6 machine, but they're not going to be widely available like most fighting games are.
90405	91866	Go to Namco Arcade, they'll have it.
92787	93147	You think?
94008	102595	I'm pretty sure, because when I worked for Aladdin's Castle and Cyber Station, we had this super deluxe Tekken, this is when Tekken 3 came out,
103288	105489	But we had them well before everybody else did.
105609	106410	But that was a U.S.
106470	107150	release, right?
107810	112573	Right, but we had them for months before they were allowed in any other arcade.
112793	121397	My curiosity is, though, I almost wonder if the opposite wouldn't be true, is that since this game won't come out in the U.S., then Namco Arcades wouldn't support them.
122278	122598	I don't know.
122678	125059	I would think that they're going to have one or two.
126320	130762	I really think that the bigger Namco locations would have one.
131519	132179	Well, we'll see what happens.
132420	134101	Regardless, that kind of does suck, though.
134501	137123	I mean, to hear that a new Tekken game is coming out in the arcades.
137143	138504	That pisses me off.
139084	139805	Well, it's sad.
140125	141626	But that's where arcades are going.
141846	144308	That shows you how lucrative arcades are right now.
144368	144768	It's sad.
144828	146209	That makes my heart hurt.
148771	155516	Usagi's in chat and says, Man, I have three gamers in this room with me, and they all gave me a dirty look when they got the news about Tekken 6.
155816	156216	Sorry, guys.
156256	156876	We don't write the news.
156917	157557	We just report it.
158459	160360	I would say write your cards and letters to Namco.
160420	163381	Let them know you want to see this game in the US and that you would spend money on it.
165082	167703	Say, Namco, we don't need any more fucking Pac-Man.
167743	168763	Bring us Tekken 6.
168823	169763	Thank you.
169803	171884	Yeah, phrase it just like that and see how far that gets you.
174505	174765	All right.
174785	177286	That makes me very, very sad.
177326	178046	Are you going to write a letter?
178807	181348	I'm going to go there and run them over with a tank.
184029	184409	All right.
186038	192239	Moving on to what's hopefully a little bit happier news, I don't know, Gran Turismo 5, the prologue version.
192619	194940	Finally, some more information about that for the UK.
195000	198861	We had some information about the US last week, but now we have some more information for the UK.
198921	206442	It's going to be on the European PlayStation Store on March 27th, followed immediately the very next day by a version on Blu-ray.
206542	210223	So yes, you can buy the prequel to a game that will be coming out on Blu-ray, whatever.
210523	213364	You all know the deal with Gran Turismo 5 prologue at this point.
214066	219770	The game will be coming out on that day and the price that you will pay for it is $24.99.
221170	225973	That's $24.99 pounds sterling in the UK.
226374	228275	That's about $50 US.
229235	231317	That's just because the US dollar sucks.
232417	233618	It might be at this point.
233658	234018	I don't know.
234318	235079	It really is.
235299	236400	That still kind of sucks.
237160	239942	Everyone's like, oh, stuff's so much more expensive in the UK.
240062	241423	No, our dollar just really sucks.
241463	241823	That's all.
242313	244895	Also, there's the Europe PS3 bundle.
244915	248518	They're actually getting a bundle that has Prologue in it.
248818	249839	£299 for that on March 28th.
250920	252121	We talked about that last week.
252541	253182	That's right.
253362	254783	I just wanted to remind.
255103	266192	They should have a little underscore on that saying, get you ready for the full game when it finally comes out and we'll sell it to you for $60 and you'll buy it because you are... The £60, which translates to $100 American, probably.
266872	270195	At that time, it would be like $6 billion American.
271136	271356	Well...
272319	285167	For those loyal Tekken fans like me here over in the US, Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection Online players are going to be getting an update that allows the DualShock 3 support.
285807	288268	So, yay.
288468	299215	It also will have some different online tweaks, like a one-on-one pickup match, some updates to the lobby, and...
301011	303212	Some of your ranking updates, that type of thing.
303232	305732	I'm like, okay.
306312	307512	Well, I guess that's kind of cool.
307692	317235	I mean, you know, considering most people were missing Rumble pretty badly, now the fact that they're going to bring it back, I guess... I don't know, is it too little too late, though?
318235	318435	Maybe.
318475	323436	I mean, do you think there'll be a lot of people that go back and say, oh, I'm going to run back and play Tekken 5 because I can have Rumble now?
324836	328577	It's worth a try, especially if you don't have to really pay anything for it.
329147	333029	I don't think anyone's going to really go back and play those games just because it didn't have Rumble.
333289	333769	You know what, though?
333789	340252	Then again, I think about myself, and I actually went back and played... Do you remember that game Crystal Quest that came out on Xbox Live like a year ago?
340712	342473	You know they did an upgrade to that not that long ago?
343094	348636	They had upgraded a game that added some type of combo meter in it, so I went back and played the game to see if the combo meter was exciting.
349557	350917	I played about half a game, then I quit.
351578	356760	Because I was like, this game was much cooler when it was originally on the Apple in two colors, white and black.
358919	359859	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
388868	390349	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
416522	446066	tangent, tangent I played a strip poker game and CG was you remember those old school strip poker games they released for like the old systems like there was like they had strip poker on the Commodore 64 and all that stuff it was just basically these really pixelated pictures of women you know they had a CGA version of that there was I don't I remember that my grandparents or something bought us a Muppets game or something like that and we thought it didn't work
446618	448739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
469041	471123	Some folks in chat are asking what's CGA.
471163	475267	Again, CGA was the old school like PC color graphics adapter.
475687	479270	And it was when your monitors went from being monochrome to four colors.
480111	483454	And you could either have red, green, yellow, and black or cyan, magenta.
484155	486297	What am I missing?
486717	486957	Yellow.
487037	487638	Yellow and black?
487938	488959	No, but it wasn't that though, was it?
489471	490011	White and Black.
490051	491212	It was Cyan Magenta, White and Black.
491252	491732	Right, right.
492753	498116	Okay, and then after CGA was EGA, Extended Graphics Adapter, when it went up to 16 colors.
498636	499556	Then we had VGA.
499596	500537	And then VGA, 256.
500917	501998	And then SGA.
502118	502738	Super VGA.
502798	505760	Super VGA, and pretty much everything you see now is some type of extension.
505820	506960	SGA, yeah.
507040	508941	All that crap.
508961	513864	A little history lesson from your old friends at Orange Lounge Radio, your ever-aging friends.
515365	517806	Hey, I remember playing on monochrome.
518563	519924	So anyways, to get back into the story here.
520425	522406	Yeah, Street Fighter 4 for four colors, right?
522486	524548	Yeah, Street Fighter 4, four color edition.
525949	534275	They're getting a brand new character, a Lucha Libre wrestler named El Fuerte, or Fuerte, or I don't know how you pronounce it.
534415	535436	His name is El Farto?
535456	538358	I wonder what his special is.
538378	540740	No, I believe it's Fuerte?
540760	541360	I don't know.
541941	544563	Wasn't that a Howard Stern character, Fartman or something like that?
544583	545203	Yes, Fartman was a Howard Stern.
545223	547065	Do you think Howard Stern will sue Capcom?
547385	547485	No.
548070	548810	El Asa Wipo
574690	575910	You know what's funny?
577851	585173	I forced my wife to watch some Lucha Libre last night just very briefly because we couldn't find anything on TV.
585193	586393	So I'm like, okay, Lucha Libre.
586413	587234	I'm going to turn that on.
588094	588934	Yeah, I don't like it.
590354	594716	RossDLUT in chat says, oh, yay, another piss-poor Hispanic stereotype.
595836	596156	Wrong.
596476	599337	Another piss-poor masked wrestler stereotype.
601704	601924	FirePro
630765	633686	Fire Pro Wrestling, they actually had a new game that came out last year.
634886	647591	Because I really think that, you know, we need to... Because, you know, a lot of the WWF games that come out, or WWE games that come out over here, have all of the moves from some of Japan's best wrestlers in it.
648011	652012	I was like, why don't they just do a game called Stereotypical Wrestler of the Game?
653073	653433	Awesome.
654730	664355	and have it just be... True, you wouldn't have your support of your WWE franchises and all that, but you have all these classic moves and stuff shoved into it.
664775	675180	Instead of being stuck in 2D fighter like what was the old Wrestlemania that was out way back in the day where you could play as The Undertaker back when he was still really cool and not riding a bike.
677401	678401	Who else was in that?
678701	679482	Doink the Clown.
680943	681763	You could play as them.
683037	684838	I would rather play as Pennywise the Clown.
684878	686279	That would be a video game I would buy.
686359	687079	We all float here.
688800	690081	Anyway, anyway.
690161	691261	Kiss me, fat boy.
693022	706569	I think that they should just satisfy the world's apparent need that they think that we have for wrestler stereotypes and just do wrestler stereotype the game and have you make whatever you want.
710147	715691	I just worry that opens the door to racial stereotype the game and not going to be a good thing for video gaming's image.
716171	726578	I want a game that combines wrestling and Katamari so that as you're fighting them, body parts fall off and get stuck on your body and you're fighting them.
727658	732541	Like a fighting game where you're fighting tons of people and then your character has 50 arms and stuff.
732561	733062	That'd be pretty cool.
733082	734583	What was that old school game?
735023	735964	Really old school.
736304	736504	Huh?
736824	737704	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
766471	767832	I think the hand is really Mickey Mouse.
791263	792204	That's the happy one.
792364	794326	Is that the one that the art is
812113	813133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
841504	842725	Something to note about that, though.
843185	849088	Apparently, in the stress test, the rumor is it's only Ken, it's only Ryu, and it's only one stage that you can play in.
849968	852789	But still, it's a sneak peek at what the game's going to look like.
853770	857871	If you want to try another sneak peek of what the game will look like, it's called Street Fighter 2.
859872	861073	It's already available on Xbox Live.
861153	867175	I'm actually very excited about this because I had a whole bunch of Udon Kruise fans
869152	877155	and actually I keep them on my DeviantArt friends list just to see the previews and the new art coming out that they do and their work is fantastic.
877315	882937	It's just really, really good and perfect for that genre.
882957	883657	I think it's really good.
883777	884077	Oh yeah.
884157	888279	I don't mean to knock the awesome art style in this game but do you know why this game keeps getting pushed back?
890119	892760	So that we'll forget we already spent $10 on it a year ago.
895541	896241	Just wanted to say.
896461	897162	I'm gonna get it.
898162	898282	So
899053	900874	is a public beta of the game.
902855	903675	Call it what you will.
904756	905076	I don't know.
905116	910778	In some way, it seems to me like kind of a cheap tactic to get people more incentive to buy this Commando 3.
911659	914440	Then again, why do you think tons of people bought Crackdown?
914460	916441	But Crackdown actually ended up to be a really good game.
916741	922724	Not to say that Commando 3 won't as well, but it's interesting that that same tactic is now being employed elsewhere.
922784	923804	That's what I could do.
923904	925025	I like jumping the game.
925655	926315	It's awesome, though.
926335	931158	Did you see the HD remake of 1942 that they were showing off to this week?
931258	932158	I'd heard about it.
932238	935540	It didn't make the show real for tonight, but what did you see about this?
935780	936781	It looks awesome.
937141	937681	Well, I like 1942.
937801	938642	It's pretty cool.
938702	940163	That's a great series of games.
940363	942644	It's basically just redone all HD and pretty.
943430	943810	I don't know.
943830	948813	You know, interesting that Capcom's revisiting a lot of their series in HD because you also have Bionic Commando also coming out.
948853	949093	Yeah.
949214	959820	But that's kind of cool because a lot of us have been saying for a long time that's what they should be doing is, you know, remaking the games in HD and not just releasing, you know, frumpy old Tron with no frills.
960080	961161	and like shit like that.
961281	962001	That's retarded.
962021	965764	With one, you know, with one graphic swap that doesn't really change anything.
965784	967945	Or Contra, you know, Konami, we're looking at you.
968205	968985	Come on, man.
969306	969526	Yeah.
969826	972728	Seriously, we played Frogger, do something with it.
972848	973028	You know,
973655	976336	Just changing the sprites a little bit does not cut it.
977076	985157	I still thought it was funny that when we got the old Contra over here, it actually had less stuff to it than the original did.
986037	987138	You know what pissed me off?
987158	992159	You know what game I was randomly playing the other day, just for old time's sake, was Gyruss on Xbox Live Arcade.
992179	992819	Sweet!
992859	995799	Well, it is one of my all-time favorite shooters that they had in the arcade.
995859	997020	I freaking love Gyruss.
997040	998680	I used to play it on Commodore 64 all the time, right?
999173	999273	Cry.
999393	999793	Very sad.
999813	1001575	There's a little bit of other news that should make some people happy.
1028037	1033862	Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Special Edition is coming out in the UK.
1038661	1049304	Well, actually more of a special pre-order position, edition, sorry, that GameStation is offering that will have a 48-page art book and slipcase packaging.
1049364	1056507	It will be £29.99, and it's actually the same price as the non-special edition.
1056547	1062469	So basically, you pre-order it from there, you get the Neato book, and you don't pay any different than you would have otherwise.
1065710	1065890	But...
1068335	1079662	They're also going to be getting Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII on PSP in spring, but GameStation has it down for summer, so you'll actually get it before then.
1080902	1082383	Just hop on there and take a look at it.
1083504	1084584	Hooray for incentives.
1085685	1085865	Yep.
1086625	1086845	Neat.
1087326	1089747	Unfortunately, we're not getting anything like that over here as far as I'm aware.
1090848	1090948	Boo.
1092282	1092402	E.A.
1092442	1094024	and their bid to try to take over Take-Two
1116144	1143625	Now they have decided to go hostile with their bid and they're actually going to try to buy out individual shareholders now at $26 a share and no real comment to what's going to be happening here but apparently EA has confirmed that yes they are doing this and Take-Two has basically informed their shareholders to hold out a little bit to see
1144883	1146184	What's going to happen in RRC?
1146204	1147705	What kind of decision do they come up with?
1148785	1149145	I don't know.
1149245	1150426	I don't like the whole thing at all.
1150726	1159770	EA puts out some pretty good games, but at the same time, I know why they're doing it, just to get rid of the 2K sports franchise.
1160691	1162212	And that's not a good thing.
1163672	1167454	The sports games really haven't innovated too much between releases and now.
1167954	1172737	If they have full reign over everything, what makes you think they're actually going to try to innovate each year?
1172777	1173497	They don't have to.
1174561	1181522	Odd1 in chat at chat.orangelunchradio.com says, I expect EA to eventually just walk into the boardroom with socks full of quarters.
1181622	1182523	You're ours now.
1183623	1186183	RossDealUT says, Take two, put themselves in this position.
1186203	1188284	They're only ever in the green when GTA comes out.
1188604	1190184	So, of course, shareholders are nervous.
1190644	1197705	Interesting point, though, kind of brought up there is that do you think that EA is trying to do this now before Grand Theft Auto hits shelves?
1197865	1198065	Yeah.
1198865	1201586	I think that they're trying to – and if the shareholders were smart –
1202423	1207288	They gotta know that Grand Theft Auto 4 is gonna fucking make tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of money.
1207709	1224106	The problem, and they are right, they don't have a lot of great releases that come out, but at the same time, I think a lot of their money has been trying to defend themselves against all these lawsuits and shit from stupid fuckers suing them for God knows what, blaming them for all sorts of violence and problems and
1224813	1225333	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1252961	1253581	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1281494	1284015	But this company relies so much on one game, I worry.
1284376	1290219	Well, everyone's focusing on Take-Two, but Take-Two owns a bunch of smaller companies that do release a lot of stuff.
1290239	1293080	Like, 2K releases quite a few games throughout the year.
1293821	1302145	Plus, they do have a lot of smaller stuff that they deal with, like, not Destination, but like, no, Destination, or DSi games, I think they do.
1302645	1303346	Not Destineer.
1303566	1308168	But they have a lot of releases that come out that a lot of people don't realize are from them.
1308188	1309029	Yeah.
1309656	1312077	And they do have solid stuff coming out.
1312277	1315038	It's just, yeah, they do rely a lot on Grand Theft Auto.
1315238	1319279	But there's Midnight Club, and they've got some good stuff in the pipelines.
1319299	1323281	You know, Knorr and the new Mafia game looks okay.
1323401	1329183	Not that they're really that different than Grand Theft Auto, but at least they're pretty decent games.
1329303	1331644	And they make what they put out pretty good.
1331744	1334304	Like Warriors, holy crap, the Warriors game is awesome.
1334905	1335725	It's just, I don't know.
1337440	1364849	I'd rather them kind of fumble through it and be their own entity than EA buy them because if EA buys them then I think that could be starting a downfall of the gaming industry because you're going to have EA and Activision owning everything and then pretty soon they're going to be like hey you know what we don't really have to innovate too much and then people are just going to lose interest in this shit and they're just like well fine I'm not going to buy any more games anymore and there goes the industry or the industry turns independent
1365731	1367552	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1395928	1402689	Obviously, the last two prequel games that they released, Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories, weren't that great and didn't make them that much money.
1402989	1407070	I don't think that much development time went into them, though, either, because they're pretty much just using the old engines.
1407570	1410571	But that's the same thing that's going to happen with the newer games.
1410651	1414451	Obviously, the next game, they're probably going to do another Vice City or something like that.
1414891	1417892	It's going to be using a similar engine and another San Andreas.
1417952	1421173	Maybe they'll use another similar engine, and those will make a lot of money as well.
1422913	1423213	I don't know.
1423891	1426729	A lot of development up front, but I think they make it up in the back end a little bit.
1427999	1430241	All right, well, lots of legal news.
1430261	1431882	I mean, you could consider that some type of legal news.
1431922	1436125	And then there's just lawsuits going everywhere this week, and they all center around Guitar Hero.
1436825	1441508	Harmonix actually sued and then unsued Activision earlier this week.
1441988	1454657	And it all had to do basically that, okay, the original Guitar Hero, I guess, had some type of clause that Harmonix would get some type of royalty payment, the way the royalty payments were set up, if they ever left the series.
1455796	1457017	and there were two different figures.
1457137	1467966	One was low, one was high and they're basically saying Harmonix was claimed that they were being paid the lower royalty scheme and they should be getting about $14.5 million out of Guitar Hero 3's profits.
1468626	1471829	But then I guess at some point this was retracted.
1473750	1479154	So there it was and I don't know if maybe there was some type of settlement out of court but the settlement was quickly retracted.
1479534	1480135	But then...
1480859	1482300	Gibson jumped in the mix.
1482400	1483961	Gibson, of course, makes guitars.
1484642	1486784	Gibson decided to sue Activision.
1487304	1497311	And they said the reason why is because Activision was actually infringing on a patent that dates back nine years for technology to simulate a musical performance.
1499113	1503176	Activision is, of course, filed basically saying that the claim is invalid.
1504218	1514403	Gibson actually sent Activision a letter in January saying... Activision basically said, you know, well, since you didn't really do anything about it, we thought it was okay.
1516444	1516925	Interesting.
1518005	1519186	Yeah, just like immersion.
1520386	1524528	Well, you didn't say anything until now, so we thought it was okay that we stole your shit.
1525489	1527550	But I thought Gibson was licensed for Guitar Hero.
1527570	1530051	I mean, don't they have Gibson guitars?
1530452	1530732	Yeah.
1531532	1533253	So this is stupid.
1534093	1534593	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1553988	1554468	and DarkSakura.com.
1578243	1582725	They think if it comes out in Japan, it's, you know, free reign to, you know, take it here.
1583326	1585407	Odd One says, I love that conspiracy theory.
1585487	1585887	I do too.
1587728	1591010	No, I'm pretty sure, I'm more than positive that that was the biggest influence.
1591730	1596473	I'm tired of people, like, patenting all this shit, like, you know, device to simulate performance.
1596823	1597643	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1626724	1627765	I now own the rights to that.
1628545	1630886	So all you fuckers better pay up because I need the money.
1660990	1671899	My FU of the week, and I've got a couple actually, goes to this device that I'm about to put up on the webcam, and I am currently strapping it to my hand as I speak.
1672439	1681487	It is this stupid finger brace that they think I'm supposed to be wearing, that I'm not gonna, because it rubs a wall spot on my hand and I can't get it off.
1683008	1687392	Um, yeah, I didn't get the cortisone shot in the hand like I thought I was going to.
1687872	1688833	Instead, um...
1689693	1695476	They're putting me in a brace for another month, and I get the cortisone shot right after my birthday.
1696756	1700658	You might want to say that, just really quickly one more time, because while you were trying to put the brace on, the mic was far away.
1701239	1702159	I was thinking over.
1702239	1703380	I'm sorry.
1703520	1703740	Yeah.
1704360	1707221	I put this on because I'm going to put it on the webcam to show everybody.
1707522	1712544	They put me in a brace for my finger that I'm supposed to be wearing when I'm not typing or otherwise doing stuff.
1712584	1714405	It's actually a big pain in the ass because I can't.
1715686	1719928	It's to keep me from bending my finger at the primary joint where I've got the swelling on the tendon.
1720468	1722729	So, um, they didn't do the cortisone shot.
1722809	1728871	Instead, I am, um, uh, getting it done, uh, two days after my birthday.
1729111	1730332	It's a fuck you enhancement tool.
1730712	1731892	It is a fuck you enhancement tool.
1731912	1733033	You should go show the folks on JustinTV.
1733073	1733953	That's what I said I was gonna.
1733993	1734813	Alright, then go, go.
1734913	1741416	And the other, the other F you goes to my husband for, um, uh, assigning me housework.
1741997	1742858	All right, meanwhile, Loki.
1767678	1774323	F you to the people that went and saw the movie Horton Hears a Who during our private screening.
1774643	1776765	Two groups of people in particular.
1776925	1785010	Number one was the people that thought it was smart to try to movie hop into our private screening for our company.
1785551	1792075	I mean, these are people that actually think that we're not going to notice somebody that doesn't work in our company coming in.
1792576	1795678	Meanwhile, with like a half an hour left of the movie to go...
1796144	1798185	with their four screaming kids.
1798665	1807307	And then after they came in, spilled popcorn on the floor, they also managed to ask people to move so that their screaming kids can sit in the seat.
1807787	1813529	Mind you that these people have been sitting watching the movie patiently for like an hour prior to that.
1814089	1820531	So, F you to them and also F you to the person sitting next to me with their screaming child who didn't want to be
1821874	1823075	or didn't want to watch the movie anymore.
1823115	1828877	He was running around in the aisles and stuff and smashing popcorn on the floor and slamming the seats down.
1829477	1832138	And the father was like, stop laughing, stop laughing.
1832638	1835940	How dare you laugh at this funny movie?
1835960	1837160	Should they have been kicked out?
1838081	1844343	Well, they should have been, but movie theater people are lame and they don't like to do anything.
1845123	1846524	That's why you get the manager.
1847406	1856580	Well, I didn't feel like leaving the theater and I could possibly tolerate this kid, but he was annoying and everyone was staring at him, but the dad was just stupid, you know.
1858003	1861308	Oh well, everyone will talk about him behind his back when he gets back to work on Monday.
1863587	1870372	Alright, my FU of the week goes to the random pains that I've been having and the fact that I was taking all these drugs to counter the pain.
1870392	1872233	And I might have caused more pain by doing that.
1872754	1884562	An FU to the fact that on the antibiotic I was taking, the sticker that says do not take with antacids was probably not large enough because I ended up taking an antacid and I think I fucked some... I hurt.
1885783	1888585	But I'm having a hard time with tonight's show, but I'll be okay.
1889046	1890887	Just FU to mystery pain that after...
1891380	1895102	The lab tests and blood work and all this stuff I had, they still can't figure out what it is.
1895162	1898843	Although thankfully my abdominal pain is really going away, so I guess that's good.
1900204	1902225	It's one of those mystery things you'll never understand.
1904246	1906387	So yeah, F you to random sickness and pain.
1907267	1907667	It sucks.
1909188	1910529	No, I'm not pregnant, chat.
1910729	1911029	F you.
1911809	1912409	F you to chat.
1912770	1913990	Why do they say you're pregnant?
1914090	1917172	I don't know, because when you have abdominal pain, it might be the baby kicking.
1917232	1917572	I don't know.
1919072	1920153	I can't explain their reasoning.
1920919	1921599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1947984	1952887	Mailbag at OrangeLabsRadio.com Send us those questions you've always wanted to ask us, those comments you wanted to say.
1953608	1957510	Meanwhile, DarkSakura will open up and read the crumbs that we do have.
1959211	1962753	First email comes from DJ Janai.
1962773	1965335	It says, hi, OLR, it's DJ Janai.
1966429	1967590	Oh, that's not just a clever name.
1967610	1968611	It says, check this out.
1968631	1970453	Basically, it's a link to something.
1970493	1981503	SmileDK will be looking for their samurai at San Japan, first major anime convention in SA to premiere band...
1984284	1985104	First ever U.S.
1985164	1985944	debut concert.
1985984	1987185	I guess it's from a translation.
1987745	1997507	So, San Japan and Vivera Studios are proud to announce the North American musical debut concert of their fan favorite band, Smile DK.
1997947	2012770	Smile DK will be making their grand appearance at San Japan 1.5, the first major Japanese culture and anime convention in San Antonio, Texas, as they will be performing on August 9, 2008 at El Tropicano Riverwalk Hotel in downtown San Antonio, Texas.
2013536	2016620	So, and I'm sure most of us know who SmileDK is.
2016680	2020204	So, anyway, they're going to have a new single.
2020244	2021125	So I thought that was pretty cool.
2021165	2023708	And thanks for letting us know about that so that we can tell everybody.
2025510	2026732	I hope they sing Butterfly.
2031577	2034359	Next one.
2034499	2040825	As an avid UK-based listener of your show, my heart nearly skipped a beat at the news last week of Super Smash Bros.
2040845	2041545	Brawl's launch.
2041665	2048951	Imagine my horror but lack of disbelief when I then checked with my friendly favorite online retailer and found out that Super Smash Bros.
2048991	2051954	Brawl wasn't to be released until June in the UK.
2052354	2057158	That's right, a three-month wait for a AAA title that has already been translated into English.
2058536	2060558	The thing is, I know why this happens.
2060638	2065601	It's the whole NTSC, PAL, and multiple European language thing means that there will be delays.
2065821	2068502	But Nintendo has launched simultaneous releases before.
2069723	2075887	To be honest, I really don't see why Nintendo and other companies cannot treat the UK as a separate territory to the rest of Europe.
2076407	2078448	We don't even have the same taste in games.
2078528	2081850	Not that I wish to arouse traditional British anti-continental sentiment.
2082350	2086973	If it's in English, release the damn game in the country that made the damn language.
2088541	2092924	Well, there's a lot of games that get released in the UK, too, that we don't receive over here until a lot later.
2092944	2093624	We didn't get Mother 3.
2093884	2095265	Like anything from Eidos.
2095865	2096886	We didn't get Mother 3.
2098527	2105731	The other thing, too, is that a lot of games like Smash Bros., it's selling like hotcakes, and they can't make enough discs.
2106471	2107532	Well, there's more to this email.
2108412	2109453	As for Super Smash Bros.
2109473	2115316	Brawl, I bought the new freeloader disc for the Wii and have imported a copy of the game from Canada.
2115657	2117858	Here's me flipping the bird to you, Nintendo of Europe.
2118653	2121494	Oh, as for the Didgeridoo Techno guy, I've seen him in person.
2122214	2127296	He was playing on the streets of Edinburgh during the Edinburgh Arts Festival in Scotland last summer.
2127756	2131317	I have my own video footage if you want to see slash hear more.
2131977	2133618	And I guess it would be pronounced nige.
2134238	2135358	That's how it's written down.
2136439	2136979	So that's cool.
2137019	2137699	Yeah, I want to see.
2138699	2140860	I would actually really, really dig seeing that.
2142680	2144001	In case he played something different.
2146122	2146582	That's cool.
2147222	2147602	Next email.
2149166	2153687	Hey OLR crew, in the words of AVGN, you know what's bullshit?
2155928	2159889	People who complain that a game is too short just because it takes under 10 hours to complete.
2160369	2165250	Whatever happened to a time when games usually took 30-60 minutes to clear and gamers were happy with it?
2165790	2173972	These days when I read a review of an arcade style scrolling shooter or 2D platformer, one complaint that I see commonly that sticks out to me is that the game is short.
2174995	2184639	I understand that longer, more epic games allow you to take in the game environment, absorb yourself in the character, but it's nice to play a quick, short game that is intended to be replayed again and again.
2185080	2189962	Even Gradius V, a shooter that takes an hour and a half to complete, gets complaints of being too short.
2190662	2198546	Someone please explain to me how 25 hours would work out, and how that isn't going to put a strain on the level designers.
2199786	2200927	Now, a year and a half ago,
2201360	2203923	You asked listeners if games these days are getting easier.
2204283	2205544	This is related to that question.
2205564	2210730	Do you think games are getting longer and longer and that shorter, meant to be beaten in one sitting games are going away?
2210950	2211470	That's from GS68.
2213842	2220385	You know, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head there is that it's not the fact maybe that a game takes less than 10 hours to beat that people rag on it.
2220685	2224907	But if it has no replay value, then, you know, it sucks.
2225827	2229089	For instance, a game like Katamari Damacy, can't you roll through that game?
2229689	2231650	Can't you roll through that game in like two, three hours tops?
2231850	2234251	Yeah, but you can go back through and get the challenges.
2234431	2234931	Exactly.
2234951	2239493	And that's what people love that game because you have the total replay value and just, you know, it's cool to go roll stuff up.
2239853	2243336	Now, even though I kind of think they've beaten the Katamari franchise in the ground, but never mind.
2243376	2244837	I'm talking about the original one.
2245397	2247099	It had definite replay value to it.
2247299	2251962	Well, we've gone back, though, and put in all of our old shooters before, even though you pretty much play them all the same way.
2252122	2252323	Sure.
2252463	2256666	I mean, how many times do I just go talking about loving our type?
2257395	2257915	For example.
2258095	2264377	But a game like a role-playing game that really relies on story to motivate you to play the game.
2264437	2268479	Once you play through the story once, very few RPGs have a lot of replay value.
2268519	2269139	Chrono Trigger.
2269959	2273921	Obviously some do, be it multiple endings, super bosses, whatever it is.
2274561	2276602	They try to put a little more value in it.
2276622	2278122	Every RPG needs Game Plus.
2279503	2286185	But that's why some RPGs feel a little bit lacking is that when they don't have that and they're only 10 hours to beat, then it might be.
2286587	2288688	So it really depends on what type of game it is, I guess.
2289449	2293592	Well, it is even bringing up, though, people complaining that Grotty S5 was short even though it was an hour and a half.
2293732	2298035	And I completely disagree with them saying it was remotely short.
2298615	2303198	I think that a shooter, you know, shouldn't need to be more than, like, an hour in length.
2303799	2314086	Because the whole point is to get from point A to point B. And then hopefully pass the boss at point B and get to point C. You know, I actually liked...
2315015	2317861	Some of the, I guess, not as long shooters.
2317921	2324934	Like, I played through Cotton however many times and Raiden DX is another one of my favorite shooter games.
2327333	2334901	Sometimes with shooter games, part of the fun is trying to play it through it and beat your score or beat it faster, you know, and start to learn the patterns in the game, you know.
2335402	2336683	I could tell you anything.
2336843	2346054	I could probably pick up Sky Shark right now and play through the first four levels and not die because I had the game memorized because that's the only damn way you could play through that game was to memorize where everything was.
2346674	2346954	Nice.
2347235	2348216	But still, I mean...
2349008	2349288	Just now?
2377445	2379146	Not just now, but we got it right before I pulled up.
2379346	2379626	Gotcha.
2381146	2383127	So, virtual console games are overpriced.
2383147	2384968	You guys have already gone over this.
2385348	2390109	But you haven't gone over it in a while, so this is kind of irrelevant to, well, anything.
2390469	2393630	But I have an idea to fix it.
2394931	2400392	If people pay yearly subscriptions for Xbox Live, Nintendo could do something like that for virtual console.
2400853	2404714	Yes, I mean exactly along the lines of the Sega Channel, because I freaking love the Sega Channel.
2405302	2408543	It's not... I'm not actually sure how it would work, but I thought I would share it.
2408563	2409744	And that's from Red Winged Saturn.
2412945	2413145	Yeah?
2413625	2413946	Oh, I'm sorry.
2413966	2414706	Right on time?
2414766	2415066	Real quick?
2415166	2416327	I was working on something else.
2416347	2416587	Sorry.
2417387	2419608	Well, we've brought this up... We've actually brought this up on the show.
2419948	2424190	Instead of paying for your virtual console games, you pay a subscription cost.
2424270	2425790	Like... Oh, like GameTap.
2426631	2426831	Yeah.
2426851	2427311	Basically.
2428331	2430412	I would love to see Nintendo set something like that up.
2430952	2432013	There's something like Sega Channel.
2432683	2437626	A lot of their games, you don't want to spend $5 on a game that you only want to play a couple times.
2438087	2443890	But I think that's exactly why it's not set up that way, because I think Nintendo, in a way, kind of preys on that sort of system.
2445191	2447553	I've also heard of Xbox Live.
2447973	2452736	Somebody had suggested instead of charging the $5 for the game, you pay $0.25 a play.
2455467	2459289	But then I think about some of the systems back in the 80s and 90s.
2459349	2461870	I remember I had an old school cable system back in the 80s.
2461910	2462970	It was way ahead of its time.
2463730	2467772	We had a system where you could actually buy games for like 10 cents a game and play them.
2468652	2469533	And it didn't do very well.
2469953	2470933	It wasn't very well received.
2470973	2473134	People don't like to play that way for whatever reason.
2476756	2479637	I think honestly if they stop making money, they'll change it.
2479697	2480857	But in the meantime, it works.
2480937	2482318	And if it ain't broke, they ain't going to fix it.
2482714	2488198	I mean, it might sound better from a consumer end, but, you know, look at what GameTap is made up of, though.
2488238	2499525	GameTap kind of makes a thriving on, it doesn't have a lot of, I mean, it has, I shouldn't say it doesn't have a lot, it has some huge name AAA titles in it, but a lot of GameTap's charm is discovering old classics you missed the first time.
2500505	2504208	Nintendo, Xbox Live, they don't really need to do that for various reasons, so.
2505548	2506409	So that was the last email?
2507270	2507770	It was.
2508190	2508971	I double checked.
2509191	2509471	All right.
2510287	2511107	AOR, it's PKJR92.
2538493	2553298	Just wanted to tell you guys that you guys are the greatest, and if not for the difference in time zones, I will do some live every Sunday, and every show on your network.
2553938	2565182	Just want to say, you guys are great, thanks, and to do a show earlier, like earlier,
2565959	2571623	so that people in other time zones like me, I'm like three hours behind you, or sorry, ahead of you.
2572524	2579288	So, 12 o'clock at night is kind of late, because I've got school tomorrow, school the next day, etc.
2581790	2590076	Just want to say that keep going, because you guys are the only podcast I listen to.
2590436	2591777	So, the only ones I like.
2592737	2593478	So, see ya.
2594637	2595197	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2618343	2620344	We'll talk about that in our super secret forums where we discuss show thingies.
2646400	2648261	Alright, so we'll make that happen for you guys.
2648581	2649801	Let's do one more voicemail.
2649821	2650821	I thought this one was pretty good.
2652502	2655483	Hello, this is DSMaster25.
2655763	2658304	I'm a huge Hannah fan.
2658444	2661405	How dare you bash Hannah Montana?
2662285	2663245	Good lord.
2664666	2666727	Get your best Sony for once.
2666907	2668407	I'd like to see them get bashed.
2668487	2670328	Not my favorite pop star.
2670868	2674029	Oh, Miss Miley, aka Hannah Montana.
2685340	2691442	Well, I didn't realize we had legions of Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus fans that listen to our show.
2691522	2696803	So I think we need to take a moment to apologize to all the Hannah Montana fans that listen to our program.
2699604	2702485	So we apologize dearly.
2703143	2723509	if you were offended by our comments on Hannah Montana no we don't and we're really sorry we won't try to do it or we'll try not to do that again in the future and remember hey we're big fans of Hannah Montana's DS game especially Footy Monster but don't listen to him it's not because it's a good music game he just secretly really loves Hannah Montana
2733328	2735149	I just love the chat lighting up here.
2735529	2737330	DDR Dollar Bill, what the fuck is this?
2737690	2739611	RawSteelUT, the fuck is this trash?
2740031	2741952	Frisbee, why do people actually like her?
2742872	2744573	DDR Dollar Bill, I've never even heard her.
2746134	2747234	Is that what's popular?
2752717	2754017	Leave Hannah alone.
2754378	2755298	How was that voicemail?
2755458	2757059	Leave Hannah alone.
2758880	2759400	I get it.
2759870	2761511	All right, doing the whole Britney thing.
2761571	2762512	Yeah, yeah.
2762712	2763913	Please, back to gaming, please.
2765114	2768636	So this, I'm sure, is a shocker to everybody, but guess what?
2769437	2780184	2K Marin is actually working on Bioshock 2, and they have peg day forecasted release date of quarter four, 2009.
2780224	2782826	So Christmas 2009, you'll be playing Bioshock 2.
2788359	2789639	Hooray!
2791100	2792220	That's shocking.
2794981	2795241	What?
2795702	2797662	Bioshock 2 is coming out?
2798042	2799223	I am so shocked.
2799663	2800443	Beyond belief.
2801584	2802684	I would have never guessed.
2805105	2805765	You know what?
2806165	2808006	EA's working on Madden 2009.
2808566	2809486	And after that, Madden 2010.
2809826	2813508	Aren't you violating an NDA by saying that?
2813948	2814448	I might be.
2814963	2815543	Guilty Gear Guilty Gear
2845433	2850595	Guilty Gear 2 Overture is coming out, but it's not the same type of Guilty Gear you might be thinking of.
2850655	2852635	It's coming out this fall for the Xbox 360.
2852715	2854276	It's a tactical action game.
2854736	2856016	Now it's like 3D.
2856616	2864679	It takes all these characters you might know from the Guilty Gear, which, by the way, is a 2D fighting game, and now they're going to be in a 3D action strategy type of game.
2866639	2869500	It worked so well for Soul Calibur when it went to Soul Calibur Legends.
2869900	2871061	I've played it, actually.
2871401	2871701	Really?
2871881	2872081	Yes.
2874090	2877452	Thank you for having a Japanese account on Xbox Live.
2878472	2879033	It's okay.
2879313	2884755	It's very similar to Dynasty Warriors on 99 Nights.
2885696	2887537	But in the Guilty Gear universe.
2888437	2891819	I actually kind of liked 99 Nights for a little bit.
2892019	2893339	And then it got a little old to me.
2893439	2894420	It's very similar to that.
2894620	2900082	You've got enemies you kill and then checkpoints you get to and you take them over and that kind of stuff.
2900863	2901043	Um...
2901727	2903908	Definitely not a fighting game if that's what you're expecting.
2905549	2906069	It's okay.
2906610	2914053	I just wish a lot of these things, when they come to new systems, you know what, people just like fighting games, so just release Guilty Gear as a fighting game.
2914254	2918556	But they did do that already on the Wii, so at least they get it for some systems.
2919556	2921237	Others are just trying something a little different.
2922178	2923118	More power to them, I guess.
2923598	2925559	Trying to innovate, SNK.
2926380	2926800	Come on.
2928829	2929430	Well, I don't know.
2929690	2931892	I think I'll probably just end up passing on this game.
2932232	2932852	Maybe it's just me.
2933173	2937677	Well, other people who said pass were actually Microsoft.
2939518	2947665	There was a rumor going around, especially since Sony executives told the Financial Times that Sony was in talks with
2948381	2952385	with Microsoft about offering them a Blu-ray drive for the Xbox 360.
2953305	2959530	But Aaron Greenberg, who's their group product manager for Xbox 360, said, nah, no.
2960211	2967617	To quote, Xbox is not currently in talks with Sony or the Blu-ray Association to integrate Blu-ray into the Xbox experience.
2968137	2971320	That's a neat way to phrase it, the Xbox experience.
2972220	2972441	But...
2973510	2981093	He did go on to say though that right now Xbox 360 is the only console offering digital distribution of entertainment content.
2983775	2990678	We don't really know how long they're going to be the only ones that does that, seeing that Sony owns a movie company.
2991598	3001202	But hey, a bunch of us who lucked out the tail end of that and picked up one of those cheap HD DVD players, hey, I even got five free HD DVDs.
3004520	3006242	The Xbox Experience.
3006703	3007784	I know, that's so cool.
3007804	3010066	You know what the Xbox Live Experience is?
3011368	3014371	Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit, fuck, gay, gay, fuck, fuck.
3015493	3017555	That's the Xbox Live Experience right there.
3019097	3021219	There's lots of other words in there too I don't feel like repeating.
3021239	3024503	So what part of the Xbox Experience is the Red Ring of Death?
3024523	3025104	Is that...
3027540	3028400	Is that the fun part?
3028560	3030301	I mean, just wondering.
3030681	3036104	I did think that was a witty retort, though, that the Xbox does not need a Blu-ray drive because they have downloadable movies.
3036504	3037004	So ha.
3037264	3039025	And they're already high definition.
3040105	3043567	Yeah, here's a little problem with that logic, though, folks.
3043687	3050250	And anyone that actually watches a lot of pay-per-view stuff knows movies don't come out on street date on that service.
3050330	3051250	Usually it's a month later.
3051370	3055272	So if you want to watch it day one, Blu-ray...
3055953	3058834	Well, hopefully Blu-ray is the only way to go on that stuff.
3059475	3061095	Or you can watch it on DVD, I guess.
3063617	3068259	That's the angle they should work on that shit, but who really cares?
3068319	3069359	I mean, come on.
3069940	3081765	I think that them accepting Blu-ray right now into their experience is sort of like admitting some sort of defeat to Sony in some respect.
3083906	3085147	We ain't talking to those bitches.
3085987	3086667	Like, uh-uh.
3087228	3088288	I don't care what they have.
3088368	3089109	We don't want their shit.
3089389	3093772	Yeah, I mean, it would look kind of silly for Microsoft to kind of endorse a Sony product like that.
3094132	3098594	But I would think that in the next Microsoft system, they're going to have to support Blu-ray somehow.
3099095	3099615	I would think.
3099735	3100595	But who knows, you know?
3100956	3102176	Wiis don't play DVDs.
3102196	3105118	You don't necessarily have to play movies to be a console that succeeds.
3105138	3106799	They can always do the Dreamcast path.
3107019	3111582	They can always put HD DVD drives in there and use that as the format for the system.
3111642	3114924	Because who says that they have to stop making discs for it?
3114984	3115264	I mean...
3116147	3120630	Even though Toshiba stopped making them, but still at the same time, who makes UMDs?
3121691	3125853	Wouldn't that seem like a step backwards if Microsoft in their next system put an HD DVD drive in them?
3125873	3126814	It'd be hard to copy them.
3127614	3130176	There's no HD DVD drives out there now, would it?
3130376	3131217	Interesting thought.
3131757	3134198	I suppose you have this format already built up in some movie.
3134279	3136320	It'd be interesting, but I don't know.
3136340	3137220	I just don't see it happening.
3137481	3141903	It'd be akin to using the, like I was bringing up with the Dreamcast, it'd be akin to using the GigaDiscs.
3142724	3144445	And you know how long it took them to crack those.
3148940	3155522	One cool thing, though, that is entertainment-related and, I guess, download content, New Islands coming to Burnout Paradise.
3155862	3161543	A bunch of new stuff that you'll be able to play and drive your cars through and crash through and stuff.
3161703	3172926	In fact, actually, you can kind of see some of what's going to be available on that in the game right now because there's actually bridges that are being worked on and constructed, I guess, in the game.
3173579	3176321	So later on, what they're going to do is have a free download.
3176682	3179244	Yes, because these islands are going to be free.
3179344	3180004	I like free.
3180224	3184188	You'll be able to expand your experience on Burnout Paradise.
3184588	3186990	There are also going to be some new cars available as well.
3187170	3187930	Those are not free.
3189031	3189852	But those are optional.
3190132	3190573	Interesting.
3190773	3193615	Who really needs extra cars when there's a lot in the game anyways?
3193675	3194235	I don't know.
3194255	3198199	I'm not a hardcore racing fan, but I would think the new areas are more of a perk than a new car.
3198619	3198819	Yeah.
3199760	3199920	Huh.
3200131	3220395	by a long shot unless the new car is a super jet mobile that can like jump 500 miles or something like that in which case I'll need that the new car is Sonic just like was it in Ridge Racer you know where you have the hover cars and the rocket cars that's one thing about Ridge Racer it's awesome
3221004	3221504	Grand Theft Auto 4
3251485	3252326	Alright, very cool.
3252486	3255788	Although I'm not too optimistic about this sixth one.
3256789	3257289	But five.
3257870	3270199	Some of the games from their translations, Hangman's Noose, Carjack City, Bomb Da Base, Mafia Work, Deathmatch, Turf War, Cops and Crooks, Race, Deal Breaker, Free Mode.
3271440	3274963	We are gonna, you know... Does it sound legit to you?
3275143	3275923	I think it sounds legit.
3275943	3277725	That stuff sounds very legit.
3278005	3278105	Um...
3280322	3281042	I can't wait to play this game.
3281062	3282503	We're going to be playing this thing every day, dude.
3283043	3286364	And... I don't know, we're just going to kick everyone's ass online.
3286404	3286844	It'll be fun.
3287905	3289866	I hope the game sucks, just to spite you.
3290306	3290826	Yeah.
3291246	3292307	Too bad it's not going to happen.
3294547	3294927	We'll see.
3295948	3301510	Well, this actually makes me kind of happy, because everyone knows I'm a big Dreamcast fan.
3302730	3310494	We are getting Mr. Driller Online, a downloadable version that's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.
3311015	3316277	There's not a whole bunch of details on it right now, but it's been confirmed for a spring release in Japan.
3316798	3320920	So hopefully we won't get it too much longer after, and it's Mr. Driller.
3321320	3322561	I'm sure we'll get it at the same time.
3322721	3328123	There hasn't really been any releases in Japan on Xbox Live Arcade that we haven't gotten at the same time.
3328684	3329504	Well, then even better.
3330925	3331245	I don't know.
3332726	3337107	Hitstun in chat says, this looks just like Mr. Driller DS.
3338987	3339867	I wouldn't doubt that.
3339927	3340787	It's Mr. Driller.
3343148	3347229	It probably does look like most versions of Mr. Driller because it is Mr. Driller.
3350129	3351209	Mr. Driller is kind of cool.
3352850	3356410	It seems really easy at first, but there's a lot of depth to the puzzle in the game.
3356710	3357290	It's interesting.
3358871	3360271	A new version of the
3361158	3368622	Wii's Twilight hack, and that is the hack using Twilight Princess to run homebrew code, has been made available.
3368883	3382290	It's version 0.1.a3, and now what's kind of neat about it is that you'll be able to run data off of SD memory cards using the SD memory card slot in the Wii system itself.
3382610	3389795	Prior to that, you would have to have an SD Gecko or some sort of GameCube adapter to run it off of...
3390896	3393217	SD memory cards, but now you can actually do it on the drive.
3393537	3395637	Right now though, not many things supporting it.
3395837	3400779	Only game that actually works with it right now is a version of Tetris.
3401459	3405780	But, you know, soon it will be, you know, supporting a lot more things.
3406340	3411342	But that's just kind of interesting that they have this exploit in there and I don't know if Nintendo will be able to fix it.
3412602	3414043	I'm sure it'll be in the next patch.
3414363	3415883	That loophole's going to get closed right up.
3417484	3417984	But who knows?
3418424	3419144	Maybe they'll luck out.
3420816	3423018	Yeah, I know it's worked out well for Sony so far.
3423998	3435567	Some folks that have not lucked out are folks that were looking forward to playing Army of Two across different regions because Army of Two apparently has region-locked online play.
3436347	3440110	There's a very, very small little note in the manual for Army of Two.
3440611	3446635	Note, the online game modes in Army of Two are not cross-region compatible and is only supported between PAL disks.
3447175	3449357	Of course, the PAL version's manual has that note in there.
3449693	3454674	So if you were looking forward to playing folks in Europe, if you're in the US, sorry, can't do it in Army of Two.
3455374	3462676	And, you know, some people are pretty pissed off about this, but, I don't know, in a way, I kind of wonder, like, well, is it maybe because the lag is too great?
3462796	3465196	Because aren't these supposed to be some huge multiplayer matches?
3465696	3469117	And if you have one person that's far away like that, it would cause a tremendous amount of lag.
3469137	3475178	They were saying that it's just a save on server strain, you know, because Army Two is going to be the uber awesome game or something, so, you know.
3477279	3477619	I think it
3478418	3478779	I don't know.
3478979	3485704	I still wish they would leave that option open, but maybe it's not the default way to assign the players.
3486945	3491729	But if you really wanted to play against somebody in the UK or overseas, whatever, you should be able to.
3492310	3492870	It's just EA.
3492890	3493471	It's broken.
3493991	3494412	Whatever.
3496153	3497374	I hope this isn't a trend.
3497894	3498735	That's all I have to say.
3500356	3502438	Well, you can hope not.
3503059	3503239	Well...
3504654	3518965	For fans of PopCap, there's actually going to be a PopCap Hits release, a second one actually, that's going to have Heavy Weapon and Zuma on PS2 on a single disc.
3520566	3522968	So if you like your casual games, you can get that.
3523008	3524109	I imagine it's going to be dirt cheap.
3524429	3524109	$20.
3524469	3526050	That's not bad.
3526070	3526050	$19.95.
3526651	3528772	That's about the same price you'd pay for them on Xbox Live.
3528992	3529213	Yeah.
3529893	3532335	Of course, you can probably play them free online, but hey.
3533649	3534630	I like anything with weapon in the title.
3553604	3554765	P2P Network Play, not Servers Interesting
3581947	3583808	Let's go to the phones.
3583848	3589190	If you want to give us a call, again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3589230	3591231	The phone lines are now open.
3592791	3593371	Give us a call.
3593932	3594492	We'll be waiting.
3595752	3597113	In the meantime, we have a... Oh, we got a call.
3597953	3598934	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3598954	3599294	Who's this?
3600754	3601054	Oh, hi.
3601094	3602495	This is Ross DLUT.
3602595	3603615	Well, hello, Ross DLUT.
3603655	3604116	What's on your mind?
3606136	3606777	Well, one thing.
3606797	3607957	I want to go about...
3608800	3617023	I want to go back to Microsoft's decision about not supporting Blu-ray and touting their online service.
3619683	3622784	I really think they're limiting their potential audience by doing that, honestly.
3623705	3634728	You know, since, like it or not, a whole lot of Americans either can't or don't want to download movies, especially on their shitty-ass DRM service.
3635919	3639161	Wait, wait, I got to ask, what is it about Microsoft Service you don't like?
3640602	3643324	Well, I think I told you about what happened to me with my XBLA games.
3644385	3647547	Oh, you had to send your thing back, you had to re-download them all and all that?
3648968	3657554	I had to re-download them again, then I had to, well, I didn't have to re-download them, but the way the DRM works is that you can't access your content offline.
3658004	3659364	Like if your internet goes on the fritz.
3659545	3660125	Right, that's right.
3661865	3664026	I've heard common problems about that.
3664386	3666067	And the same goes for movies, basically.
3666887	3667967	Yeah, movies.
3668347	3670588	Well, movies, you don't even get to keep the movies.
3670608	3674249	You can only watch them once.
3674730	3678791	And no, Ranma, the PlayStation Network isn't anywhere near as draconian.
3678831	3685073	You can activate up to five systems and it's not anywhere near as hard to get things revalidated.
3685413	3686614	I think it's going to hurt them in the long run.
3686634	3691596	I think what we forget being in cities, you know, you're in Sacramento, I'm in Miami, I'm sure a lot of the people in the chat are from decent sized cities, is that
3715493	3727198	Large parts of the country, especially the further west you go until you get to California, broadband isn't as easily available or it's very expensive.
3729158	3733300	Not only that, but most people are going to have common customer-grade DSL.
3733320	3738282	They're not going to be paying $80 a month for the high-end stuff, you know what I mean?
3739369	3741770	They're still doing well here in Miami.
3741810	3744230	There's a blockbuster right in front of my house.
3744250	3746231	That place is always doing great business.
3746251	3749892	They're still doing well in cities.
3760839	3762601	You still don't see the mom and pop stores anymore.
3764282	3768126	My very first job was at a mom and pop video game store, and they went under years ago.
3768626	3773550	Well, that has more to do with the chains bullying everybody out than anything else.
3774651	3777194	That's a whole other issue we could spend a whole show doing.
3777494	3782398	I'll just say, though, we had one thing that Hollywood and Blockbuster and all them didn't have.
3782458	3783219	We rented porn.
3784136	3786437	So, you know, how they went out of business on their own.
3786457	3790980	Yeah, you still see places that run porn, West Coast and things like that, you know, chains here in the Southeast.
3792261	3797664	But, you know, when you go download only, you're limiting yourself.
3797704	3807791	Because let's face it, if you want to download something other than a damn, than a damn, well, Actdeft is saying it pretty much.
3807851	3810192	I mean, one megabit connection is 40 bucks.
3812604	3815706	That's not going to get you a high-definition movie in a reasonable amount of time.
3815986	3822749	I go to Xbox Live Arcade, it takes like an hour to download a movie.
3823009	3830092	So basically, if I'm understanding you right, the downloading thing doesn't do a lot for our need-it-now kind of culture, the self-gratification culture that we live in.
3830112	3836975	The reason why Blockbuster and all that do well is because when somebody thinks, I want to rent a movie, they want to rent a movie tonight, now.
3837155	3838536	They don't want to wait for Netflix.
3838596	3839776	They don't want to wait to download it.
3840116	3840857	They want to go get it now.
3841721	3842801	Well, even Netflix.
3842861	3848223	I mean, if you keep a steady queue, you always have a movie or two there.
3848283	3848723	You know what I mean?
3848943	3852524	But what if the one that's at your house isn't necessarily... And don't get me wrong.
3852544	3853164	I love Netflix.
3853204	3854144	I'm just being devil's advocate.
3854445	3860386	What if the one at your house right now isn't the one that you end up wanting to watch when you're talking about with friends?
3860786	3863847	Maybe you're talking about an old classic 80s movie that none of you has.
3863987	3867448	At the end of the day, you get in the car and you go to Blockbuster.
3867508	3868829	You get in the car or...
3871251	3875853	If you're lucky enough like I am, you walk across the street and there's your blog post, so you pick up your movie.
3876253	3880195	And with Blu-ray, you're going to be able to do that.
3880235	3886217	In the coming months, we already have Blu-ray for rental in my place, and you're going to see that all over the place.
3886237	3889618	We're going to see Blu-ray rentals all over the place, and it's just going to take over.
3889639	3891739	All right, well, we'll see.
3891819	3893140	Ross, to you too, we've got to wrap up.
3893160	3893940	We're getting towards time.
3893980	3895281	Any other last-minute thoughts?
3896821	3898262	Well, one last-minute thing.
3899165	3901587	I'm surprised you guys didn't talk about the NPDs this month.
3902628	3903508	What specifically about them?
3904669	3913155	Yeah, the PS3 outsold the 360 for the second month in a row, selling 281,000 units versus 255.
3913955	3916497	But what really surprised me was how well the PS2 did.
3917137	3918378	I don't know if you saw this.
3919559	3919859	It sold 352,000.
3922199	3923981	That's pretty typical for the PS2.
3924081	3930810	It's actually the matching... I was about to say, I mean, doesn't everybody have... It's still the spare bedroom system.
3931010	3935655	It's the system you buy for the younger kids so they can feel cool because they have a video gaming system in their room.
3935695	3941743	You know, I think most folks like us that listen to programs like this, yeah, we all have PS2s at this point, but...
3942356	3943356	It's not just us.
3943396	3946177	I mean, the system's already sold 50 million in America alone.
3946658	3951879	And the other reason that the PS3 outsold the 360 is because the 360 is in a shortage right now.
3952539	3953740	Oh, please.
3954280	3956621	Every store I go to, there's a ton of 360s.
3956641	3957421	Microsoft's making them.
3957441	3961582	Well, I know because I talked to Microsoft that there's a fucking shortage going on right now.
3961802	3964543	And they, in fact, commented, yeah, there is a shortage going on right now.
3964583	3966504	We know that the PlayStation 3 is going to outsell us.
3967526	3969428	And sure enough, then that's not just damage control?
3969828	3975953	It's not damage control, because they're going to have enough... Oh, right, yeah, okay, I'm sure.
3975973	3979255	All of a sudden, Blu-ray wins now, and they're going to sell billions of systems.
3979416	3986621	Well, actually, I was kind of thinking, like, couldn't the possibility, because now that Blu-ray's won the war, so to speak, maybe that moves some PS3s?
3986641	3987382	Not going to fucking happen.
3987442	3992245	I bet you anything in April that the 360's definitely going to outsell the PS3, and buy a lot.
3992626	3993586	What kind of bet?
3995268	3995608	Shut up.
3996966	3997827	I don't know.
3997967	4006772	It's not so much just Blu-ray, but ever since we saw the system go down to 399 with the 40 gig, you know, the sales have picked up.
4007793	4009634	Yeah, and Sony's really confident on that.
4009654	4010174	You know why?
4010234	4013717	Because now they're removing the Blu-ray movie that comes with it because they're, guess what?
4013737	4015278	You fuckers will buy your own Blu-ray.
4015298	4016819	Alright, I gotta wrap it up, you guys.
4017039	4022822	I'm supposed to keep it to four minutes and we're on seven, but Ross Steel, UT, thank you for your perspective as always.
4022863	4023403	Take care, buddy.
4024105	4024645	Okay, bye-bye.
4024665	4024945	Bye-bye.
4054441	4058486	Hi, this is Actdeft.
4058686	4059407	Hi, Actdeft.
4059447	4060008	What's on your mind?
4060168	4064052	Oh, I just wanted to comment about Video Games Live.
4064893	4065534	Oh, that's right.
4065554	4066055	You got to go.
4066876	4068958	The concert just happened in Mexico recently, right?
4069639	4069900	Yeah.
4070120	4070961	And how was it?
4072717	4075959	Oh, it was so fucking epic and amazing.
4077400	4079421	It was everything I expected and more.
4080522	4086185	It was a pretty amazing, how do you say it, show.
4086986	4088787	Describe for us the best part.
4091789	4093890	I seriously can't choose a best part.
4094902	4104228	If I had to choose a song they played, maybe it was the Kingdom Hearts theme song, Simple and Clean, in orchestra.
4104428	4106369	Oh, it was so fucking amazing.
4106889	4109931	You sound like you were blown away.
4111632	4113513	I almost cried at that part.
4114494	4116195	How was the audience?
4116275	4117516	Was there a lot of people there?
4117556	4118976	Was it a very full house?
4120958	4122959	Well, not a full house, though...
4124054	4130195	There was a lot of people, though it was not full.
4130215	4131256	Okay, not too bad, though.
4131276	4134356	Sounds like a pretty filled-up crowd, if nothing else.
4151393	4153734	Did they give an indication that they might come back?
4154294	4157336	This might just be the first of several shows in Mexico?
4158937	4166061	They said in a conference before that they may, or most probably, will come next year again.
4166581	4166941	Oh, nice.
4166981	4168122	I bet you're excited about that.
4168843	4169883	Yeah, pretty excited.
4170523	4174666	Any advice you would have to give to folks that are going to be attending future video game live shows?
4176107	4176287	Hmm.
4177085	4178106	Pretty much that.
4178446	4182269	Any seat in the concert will give you a pretty good view.
4182629	4186572	Though on the front will be a pretty good show.
4187917	4190058	ActDev, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4214288	4216569	Just an article on Joystick.
4217609	4220490	It was a report on Mexican gaming industry.
4221450	4231212	They said that by 2010, the gaming industry in Mexico will increase by approximately, I think, 10 million?
4232112	4233253	10 billion, excuse me.
4234513	4242235	So, apparently it's going to be increasing, though I find it kind of ironic that
4243183	4253812	Even though the analysts think that it's going to increase in the economy, Mexico is one of the leading markets in the world of piracy.
4254993	4259236	Games, music, movies, you name it.
4261818	4268624	I don't know how the industry will manage to beat that.
4270791	4274775	Interesting perspective from somebody who's actually there in Mexico.
4274875	4277537	Sometimes we read these stories and we don't really know what is it.
4277617	4282321	I guess my question for you is, what is the gaming... Actually, let me ask you this.
4282381	4284623	Have you ever visited the U.S.?
4285845	4286745	Yes, I have.
4287306	4294232	Have you been able to compare the availability and the prevalence of gaming here in the U.S.
4294332	4295133	versus Mexico?
4295153	4295193	No.
4296676	4303399	Well, like in the United States, you have GameStop, BB Games, many video game stores here.
4303979	4313943	We only have maybe one or two game stores, and they're only located on the southern region of the country.
4314703	4322966	Most of the stores that carry games are like supermarkets, like Walmart, for example.
4324148	4329573	and they don't have a great library of games so it's pretty difficult to find a game you like.
4330094	4331455	Where do you get your games from?
4332956	4348791	I actually get my games from Sam's Club because they are pretty cheap and they have a great library there so I'm kind of liking that but anywhere else I go I cannot find anything so I actually have to...
4350052	4355616	Get my games for them online, or I have to ask friends that go to the United States to get them for me.
4355836	4356416	To get them for you.
4356436	4363181	Well, thankfully, they run on the same televisions, and pretty much the Xboxes you get there are the same ones here, so you don't have to worry about those region-based issues.
4364401	4369445	Always interesting to hear from our listeners in other countries and kind of hear about the way the scene is there, so thanks so much.
4369725	4374328	We've got to let you go, Actdeft, because we're running out of time, but thank you very much for the call.
4375428	4376089	Yeah, thank you, too.
4376269	4376669	Take care.
4377950	4378730	We'll do one more call.
4379810	4380850	We'll see who gets through here.
4381131	4382371	We'll do some last-minute stories.
4382391	4384372	Do you have any last-minute stories for us, Loki, when we get to that?
4384932	4385052	Yeah.
4385352	4385692	All right.
4385833	4386293	Sounds good.
4386313	4388073	Why don't you go ahead and read us the first one?
4388474	4389074	Oh, no, never mind.
4389094	4389494	We got a call.
4391055	4392155	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4392175	4392535	Who's this?
4393756	4395417	Hello, Orange Lounge.
4395437	4404060	This is the, what is it, the Norwegian, no, Norwegian, Swedish owl known as Akeripper.
4404580	4406601	Well, hello, Akeripper.
4406861	4408182	I see you in chat right now.
4408906	4410647	I remember you calling in before.
4410787	4411527	How are you doing?
4412528	4413448	I'm doing just fine.
4413508	4417890	I'm, well, what, doing my WoW drugs as usual, so.
4418810	4419551	What time is it?
4419771	4422052	It's got to be like, what, four or five in the morning over there?
4423613	4431356	It's like, what is it, five, five to, ah, I don't, damn, I'm lost in time.
4433327	4435351	It's around like 5 o'clock in the morning.
4435431	4437695	He's up so late he lost complete track of time.
4437735	4438536	That's dedication.
4438596	4438997	I love it.
4439257	4439978	Well, what's on your mind?
4440179	4441421	What do we owe the phone call tonight?
4442333	4443374	Yeah, well, what is it?
4444054	4450397	I'm in the plans of buying a PSP for some weird reason, and I don't even know why.
4450557	4464845	The reason is that I want to do a homebrew on it, and I try to do some read-up on it on the web, and I'm completely lost on that for some weird reason.
4464945	4467166	I don't even know why, but, well...
4468181	4480448	And since Loki has made his homebrewed PSP, I think, if I remember right, I want to ask him, what is...
4481660	4485363	What is, does he have any kind of tip or so?
4485784	4486324	Good question.
4486364	4489227	What is kind of the best way if you're interested in doing some homebrew on the PSP?
4489247	4491448	What's the best way to do that if you don't already own a PSP?
4492089	4502357	It's not very easy because, especially with the new slim PSPs now, if you're getting one of the fatter ones, it's easy to do it because all you have to really do is, you know, downgrade the...
4504174	4508095	using any sort of exploit, either the Pandora's Battery or Grand Theft Auto.
4508615	4509295	Let me say this first.
4509335	4514776	I think part of the reason it's so complicated is because of the fact that Sony keeps patching it with every exploit that's found.
4515156	4517317	It seems like there's 50 different ways to do it out there.
4518017	4531600	One of the reasons also is that there is actually a place where you can buy a homebrew-enabled PSP for...
4532444	4532625	and more.
4548980	4556643	and well, since I'm a sheep bastard, I have the intention of just buying the vanilla and then try to make some homebrew version.
4556943	4559064	I don't blame you.
4559164	4570348	There's guides online to do the slim PSP, but what it's going to really take is you need to have someone else that has one of the original PSPs or has already made a Pandora's battery for the slim one.
4570368	4574670	And basically what you do, you'd have to have the old one to create the Pandora's battery.
4575191	4578772	Then you patch it for the slim one, and then you run it on your slim.
4578992	4583334	Should he try his luck and try to go buy a used PSP?
4583594	4590616	I would think the cheapest way to do it, try your luck in buying a used PSP, because a used PSP is likely to have an older firmware still on it.
4591136	4591517	and DarkSakura.
4608979	4609459	Sort of.
4609519	4614321	You can buy the... Okay, really quickly, what is the Pandora's Battery?
4614441	4621743	Pandora's Battery is basically you're running firmware or actual code off the battery because the battery itself actually has a little bit of data on it.
4622583	4628885	And so what that does is it pops it into a developer's mode and drops the firmware to whatever.
4628905	4631545	It basically resets the whole PSP.
4632326	4633966	And what they've done is kind of boot...
4634465	4658919	Bootstrapped a downgrader with this Pandora's battery so it's allowed them to you know drop it down to 1.5 and then once you have 1.5 you can up it to you know a custom firmware or something like that it's not easy and it's pretty confusing but there are guides that take you step by step on how to do it QJNet has a pretty good guide and stuff or at least you know
4659511	4662032	They'd have links to find a guide like that.
4662532	4664813	I was just going to ask, are there any sites that you would recommend?
4665053	4675737	Because it sounds like... Probably like PSP Hacks or PSP.QJ.net or I think PSPUpdates.QJ.net They would have links.
4675757	4679318	That's where I found mine, but it's been a long time since I did it.
4679619	4686861	Once you do get a custom firmware on there, it's pretty easy because now the stuff that they put out, I guess it's the M33 firmwares,
4689432	4691354	They're completely easy to upgrade.
4691394	4700361	In fact, now they've got it built in where you can just run an update via Wi-Fi and update it over the web just like you would a normal PSP.
4701983	4706407	It's pretty simple once you've got that working to get a homebrew on there.
4706447	4709389	It's just getting it to that is pretty hard.
4709489	4715054	Luckily, I had two PSPs, so I just used my old one to create the Pandora's Battery to do it.
4717760	4718020	Go ahead.
4718621	4719501	What is more?
4719901	4723903	Yeah, but in that way, that was just about what we were going to ask also.
4724023	4736468	Since you can actually buy one with custom firmware already on it, how will it work when you're going to have to do updates and stuff?
4738028	4738848	What is it?
4738988	4739189	Ah, not...
4743453	4751915	Oh damn, I lost the name of the game, but not LocoRoco, but the other one that's coming.
4752835	4753496	Patapon?
4753736	4754556	Patapon and stuff?
4754956	4766319	Yeah, well, what the thing is, what you're going to have to do, obviously you can't use any updates that are on UMD disk, because that will corrupt your firmware, but what you're going to have to do is just wait for them to release these updates.
4767127	4771429	Luckily though, most of the firmwares are cracked within like a day or two at the most.
4771530	4778553	Here's kind of the sad part though, is that if you want to do homebrew on the PSP, it's at the point now where you have to be pretty, you know, on top of it to do it.
4778633	4784696	Loki, and here's something to consider, is that yeah, Loki might be a sort of homebrew PSP expert, but Loki, how many PSPs do you own?
4785157	4785417	Two.
4785857	4787998	And one is for homebrew and one is for current stuff, right?
4788018	4788518	Or something like that?
4788638	4788799	No.
4789119	4789959	Oh, I thought that's how you did it.
4790059	4792741	One I just don't use and it's collecting dust and it's one of the older ones.
4792781	4793461	And the other one is,
4793922	4796524	I can play new games on it, and I can play Homebrew on it.
4796684	4797044	Oh, wow.
4798105	4798845	The Slims, yeah.
4798885	4800967	And you did the Pandora's Battery trick with it.
4801067	4801267	Yeah.
4801888	4802188	Okay.
4802368	4803449	It was a pain in the ass, though.
4803609	4805690	It was really not fun.
4806411	4813716	And luckily, I had an extra battery I bought, because I bought a charger, a new charger for it, and it came with a battery, so I used that battery.
4814456	4822702	In fact, I think I still have my Pandora's Battery, but the thing is, also, when you're doing the Slim, the patched one does not fit on a 32-meg memory stick.
4823120	4832029	So you need to make sure you have at least one that's like 128 to be able to put the data on it because you have to have a memory stick and a battery that are basically linked together.
4832189	4837795	And so what will happen is when you pop that battery in, it will run that data that's on that memory stick for you.
4838371	4840211	It's really weird.
4840271	4849473	A memory card is not going to be a problem since I actually have two memory sticks and I actually plan to buy an 8GB version if I'm going to buy a PSP.
4849653	4850794	Yeah, that's fine.
4851334	4866777	And if you buy, say, another battery or something, what will happen is once you've created it as a Pandora's battery, you can backup your battery data so that you can drop that battery back to a normal battery after it's done.
4867105	4868066	It's kind of complicated.
4868086	4869667	There's a lot of stuff on the internet.
4869947	4876652	Unfortunately, I don't remember exactly the steps to go to do it, but the information is definitely out there.
4877232	4878533	One last question, though.
4878553	4881495	About playing with your PSP Slim on a big screen, how does that work?
4881515	4883797	Well, the Slim ones, you just need to buy a cable to do it, and...
4897439	4900160	Pretty much it just involves you plugging it in.
4900320	4902220	The only problem is you're tethered to your TV.
4903800	4906061	Any extension or something like that?
4906221	4910142	Any extension cable for component or composite will work.
4910262	4913543	It's just you're still tethered via cord.
4914123	4919624	Although now they have a thing where they're going to come out with a remote dock if they're watching UMD movies or something like that.
4919824	4924285	You can control it with a remote, but still, though, it's going to be tethered to your TV.
4925293	4927116	Aki Ripper, you're right, I've got to wrap things up.
4927396	4929579	Do you have any other quick final thoughts?
4930701	4933625	Nah, not that I'm so...
4935207	4952522	I'm just a bit annoyed, just waiting for 2.4 patch to come out, since apparently you can start downloading the whole thing, so what is it, on Tuesday or Wednesday, it's going to apparently be patched to 2.4?
4952622	4961609	The background downloader is already active, my 2.4 is downloaded, I'm pretty sure it'll go live either this Tuesday or next Tuesday, but we'll see, and of course we're talking about Warcraft, if you're wondering where.
4962651	4965092	Hey, real quick, you said you were from Sweden?
4965933	4966173	Yeah.
4966373	4968174	Now, you know what I love most about Sweden?
4969514	4971135	I don't know, our royal house?
4971475	4972015	No, no.
4974296	4974616	ABBA.
4980218	4981519	Don't stop, I love the music.
4981559	4983820	Alright, we seriously gotta let you go.
4983840	4986241	Yeah, well, I can't say...
4986989	4987730	No, I know.
4987750	4990052	That was how many years ago, but it's timeless.
4990312	4991353	All right, have a good one, buddy.
4991533	4991913	Thank you.
4992373	4993174	Same to you, too.
4993214	4993534	Bye.
4994535	4996637	And, of course, the chat room's all, not ABBA.
4998398	5000059	SSJ100Matt says, Rob went there.
5000159	5001040	Oh, yes, I went there.
5005243	5006985	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
5007025	5008106	We've got to wrap up this show.
5008846	5009427	Good times.
5009467	5010127	I'm sorry, Jamie.
5011308	5012689	But ABBA, Jamie, ABBA.
5013110	5015872	I remember when you were all antsy about getting to see Mamma Mia.
5017529	5018770	Hey, the movie is coming out.
5018830	5019450	I'll tell you what.
5019490	5020031	I'm excited.
5020071	5020351	All right.
5020491	5021151	I'll go see it.
5021972	5022232	All right.
5022252	5022992	We got to wrap up.
5023032	5024473	Let's get everybody's final thought.
5024513	5026234	DarkSakura, you got like your keys in your hand.
5026274	5026895	You ready to roll?
5026915	5029837	No, I'm trying to get to my thing so I can give you my Cage Match song.
5029877	5030457	No, I'm kidding.
5030477	5031438	What's your final thought today?
5032038	5035100	Reject false icons and buy me a fucking computer.
5036241	5038102	My final thought is Heartburn sucks.
5038202	5039022	Loki, your final thought?
5040103	5043305	My final thought is... I don't know.
5043345	5045466	I got to add people on Smash Brothers Brawl.
5046407	5046487	Um...
5047481	5049122	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5077844	5083369	The trick is to make stuff that looks like other things from like, you know, pixel art type stuff.
5083810	5086612	Levels that look like, you know, mine was the question block level.
5086852	5088814	So it looks like a question block from Mario Brothers.
5088934	5089375	Gotcha.
5090376	5090716	All right.
5091178	5093219	I have one other final thought for you guys.
5093279	5099683	Oh, but before we get to that, I just want to say thank you so much as always for tuning into and downloading and supporting independent podcasting.
5100023	5104365	Remember, if you like Orange Launch Radio, all we ask, tell a friend or two about our show, spread the word.
5104965	5106666	It's how we slowly take over the world.
5107107	5111149	And I'll leave you with one last final, final thought and then say goodnight.
5111409	5111689	Goodnight.
5123956	5125637	That music will never ever get old.
5125677	5126697	Ray sure did a good cover.
5126717	5127718	I don't care what you say.
5130999	5131940	Thank you guys again.
