14224	25872	Tonight, March 23, 2008, Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live gets a new expansion, GIFs ensues even more businesses over Guitar Hero, and could Kid Icarus be really making a comeback this year?
32861	33701	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
52486	53427	I'm full of waffles.
53767	54687	Full of waffles.
55087	56388	Enjoying the Easter waffles.
56428	57909	Isn't this a tradition in your fam?
58709	62511	You and Dan always... With our big group of people.
63131	68434	Although it seems that every year there's a new baby added with our friends who join us.
68854	70435	Because like one year they had Bob.
70815	73236	The next year they have Tatiana is her name.
73816	74457	They call her Tater.
76057	77998	That's a nice name for a child, Tater.
78419	79059	She's cute.
79159	79759	She's a cutie.
79899	80520	I don't doubt it.
80560	81160	Babies are cute.
81946	110193	and um um we basically just you know went to Marie Calendars and got well everyone goes to I finally learned my lesson after doing this for eight years is um they always go through the um the omelette line and I get sick on the omelettes every year for some reason so I was like screw your omelettes I'm having eggs benedict and waffles and I had waffles and chocolate eclairs
111087	112347	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
134994	136155	All right, then happy Equinox.
136215	136916	Happy whatever.
137396	138056	Happy day.
138637	139317	Just happy day.
139578	140398	Happy day, Loki.
140659	142220	Tech Master Loki also here every week.
142560	142860	Hello.
143080	143461	How are you?
143481	144742	I'm okay.
144902	146383	Did you do anything special today?
146423	147924	Did the Easter Bunny leave you anything good?
148165	151467	No, I just went over to my mom's house and we barbecued ribs.
152248	152968	Mmm, ribs.
153889	155610	You guys have interesting ways of spending Easter.
156851	158453	I mean, interesting good, not like interesting bad.
159213	160314	But more food.
161435	163557	Or as Frisbee in chat room says...
164281	169047	Chat.OrangeLawnTrainer.com, the always present fourth guest on the show, Waffle Lounge Foodio.
171069	173192	That could be the name of the show, Waffle Lounge Foodio.
173432	175415	You could play the Waffle song from Mystery Science Theater.
175754	177094	No, we're not going to play the Waffle song right now.
177114	181075	We're going to get into how was your gaming week, but first a teaser, a little teaser.
182216	186297	We have big news to talk about, like big, like we just found out 30 minutes ago big.
187077	188257	We'll be talking about that in just a moment.
188277	193598	I know a lot of people in chat are kind of going like WTF because they can hear us on Justin TV talking and like want to know what's up.
193758	194599	And yes, someone died.
194699	195139	I killed them.
195379	196279	No, no one died.
197315	198436	The ferret died.
198476	200058	Where has he been for the past year?
200859	203942	Actually, I found the ferret the other day, and then I put him back in the dusty corner I found him in.
204302	206445	Hey, you should have brought the ferret out.
207105	209788	All right, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
210889	212651	It was uneventful.
215054	215354	Really.
215735	216055	That's it?
217074	217894	It was uneventful.
217954	218614	No DSing?
218694	219414	No Ragnarok?
219515	219875	No nothing?
219895	220775	Well, I played Ragnarok.
220795	221915	Well, of course!
221995	222535	Of course!
222655	223955	I mean, that goes without saying.
224395	226456	But I actually did not touch my DS all week.
226596	227416	I moved that game.
229256	231497	That game that Dan brought me home that I'm not going to play.
232057	233477	The Professor whatever the fuck it is.
233657	234598	Professor Layton?
235118	235358	Yeah.
235458	237038	You know, I've heard a lot of good things about that game.
237078	238938	You might actually want to check it out at some point.
238958	239679	I'm not going to play it.
241479	241779	Well...
242273	244515	DarkSakura's House DarkSakura's House DarkSakura's House
270652	272154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
290862	291362	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
317081	320142	One of the ones that's been removed on there, so I'm going to slap that back on there.
320542	324003	And they can fucking replace the thing, because I'm not touching it.
325164	325624	Bastards.
326604	329505	Yeah, and I'm addressing this comment in chat, because some people may not know.
329585	332346	Mike W. says, how many 360s does Loki have again?
332406	333266	So please refresh us.
333566	334807	How many 360s do you have?
334827	335267	I have six.
335327	336207	And why that many?
336407	338928	Because we land them in a game room.
339868	340929	And I got them for that.
340949	341629	That's amazing.
343166	343746	That's amazing.
343906	351007	Well, I had five originally, but then I bought one to replace another one, but I ended up fixing the original, so we have six.
352308	352548	Wow.
353648	362429	One that hopefully will be fixed here pretty soon, because like I said, it's not three-ringed anymore, but I think it may have overheated so many times that it's damaged, but we'll see.
364910	369411	And then this last one, which I'm sending to Microsoft, so that will be fixed.
370331	371911	So hopefully it will all be fixed at one point.
372932	379437	But it's not very promising that three out of the six have died within the last three months.
381238	381519	I don't know.
381779	381979	Nice.
382279	384621	So that's all I really got around to playing this week.
385502	393228	I do have a lot of stuff lined up for this week, including K Project, which is that res beta that got released out there.
393268	394809	So I want to try that because that looks cool.
395109	397471	I've got to dig out my Dreamcast for that.
397970	401291	and then Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core.
401931	403291	Oh, actually, I played a little bit of Smash Bros.
403331	406432	this week, but just Space Emissary stuff.
407092	411413	Oh, and I added everybody in the goddamn friends code list, so stop your bitching.
411893	412953	Okay, seriously.
413593	416674	Nobody was online when I was online earlier, so you know what?
417234	417814	Stop complaining.
417854	421315	Talking about the Orange Lounge Radio forum thread, right?
421695	421995	Of course.
422295	422495	Yeah.
422695	422775	No.
423407	425549	So I thought, yeah, I added everyone.
425589	428311	No, I didn't add everyone, but I added most people.
428792	430133	No, I think I might have added everyone.
431323	432484	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
456244	458005	and trying to unlock everything in the gallery.
458385	463687	Like, you know, play Five Brawls with Princess Peach to get Super Mario 2 and things like that.
463707	465227	I've been trying to do as much of that stuff as I can.
465787	468368	So, good times.
468748	470909	And otherwise, I haven't been playing a whole lot.
470929	474190	I went back to the Xbox 360 and just played some random old stuff.
474971	482793	Nothing really of note was playing some World of Warcraft, but I was out of town this weekend and I was staying about a block from the Metreon.
483254	484234	Didn't even think to go there.
485459	486779	It's just not what it used to be.
486799	490782	You know, if you were there next week, you could actually go to a Crisis Core launch party.
491002	491463	That's alright.
492163	494805	Well, actually, I do have to go back to San Francisco next week anyway.
495285	497147	So, maybe I'll check it out.
497347	498308	Well, it's like Tuesday.
498788	499288	Oh, never mind.
499328	500189	I'm not going on a weekday.
501190	501910	Hmm, interesting.
503531	507834	Alright, so that does... Yeah, no new games to review this week.
507874	508515	That's kind of odd.
509415	511377	I've been playing Scrabulous on Facebook.
511817	512938	It's just like Scrabble.
513979	515279	It just depends on your bandwidth.
543359	544700	If you have dial-up, you might have a problem.
545140	548643	Well, if you have dial-up, I don't think you're going to fucking be watching or downloading a movie.
548683	549364	That would suck.
550044	551305	One gigabyte file?
551385	551665	Yeah.
551865	552306	No thanks.
554707	555028	I don't know.
555408	555868	It was okay.
556369	558610	I just... Oh, I want to hear something funny, too.
559091	565135	Actually, I have a friend at work right now who's really into rock band, and he keeps playing all the hard songs for me and unlocking me achievements.
566056	566276	Nice.
566897	569258	Because, you know, I can't fucking play the game on hard.
569358	570139	What am I talking about?
571253	571993	I can play guitar.
572013	572834	I can't do drums.
573234	574834	Oh, I played Rock Band this week.
574854	576355	I played a lot of Rock Band this week, actually.
576375	577555	That's why you take it to parties.
578195	584917	Because of that new, and I don't want to spoil the story that's coming up, but some of you guys know Rock Band had some enhancements this week, and we'll talk about them a little more a little later on.
585278	587458	But I went on to check them out.
587518	594300	And I haven't checked the Rock Band store in a long time, and I forgot that you can get some Nine Inch Nails songs that are pretty cool, and I got that.
594320	597121	And then the B-52s have a song on there, so I had to get that.
597181	599382	So I went shopping on Rock Band.
600097	602137	because I heart microtransactions.
603038	603778	I've spent way too much money.
603798	605458	Not really, but yeah, I've spent way too much money.
605498	607299	Yeah, way too much on Rock Band, seriously.
607939	612280	But just think, the next party we have is going to be so bitchin' with Rock Band.
613140	614340	So we need a Rock Band party.
614620	618161	The thing though, they don't make it very easy because of that stupid digital rights management.
618301	623503	You know, anything I download and if I bring it over here or whatever, I have to be logged in on live in order for all that content to be available.
623823	624123	Sucks.
624583	625423	Yeah, it really blows.
625979	627480	Actdeft is crying in chat.
627500	630621	He says, Mexico still can't access the music store and rock band.
630922	631662	So, you know what?
631742	636004	In some ways, it's a good thing because then you just start spending money so stupidly because you're like, oh, I have points.
636084	636825	I could just spend them.
636845	637585	That sad face.
638245	638445	Yeah.
639126	639326	What?
639726	640446	That is sad face.
640507	641167	That is sad face.
641187	641807	Very sad face.
642427	643488	So, there you have it.
644409	644669	Okay.
646109	650292	So, let's get to the big news and it actually really sucks.
650372	653053	Like, there's really no easy way for us to kind of mention this.
654494	654694	This...
655959	677120	and literally we just heard about some of the changes that have been going on with our streaming provider which is Live 365 literally about 30 minutes before our show went live tonight and the long and the short of it is that Live 365 is making some obscene changes in their pricing policies and they are going to be upping their
678536	681077	They're going to be upping their rates to these obscene amounts.
681197	688160	Basically, right now, we pay about $60 a month to have about 100 live listeners.
689121	697225	We would have to pay under this new plan $120 a month for 60 live listeners, which would only barely accommodate what we do on Sundays.
698105	700106	Usually, we don't talk about ratings.
700406	705008	We get about 50 to 60 live people on a good Sunday night, and we've actually gone beyond that before.
705048	706309	I think our highest show had 70 or 80 people.
707009	710572	I want to say we have, but I don't know.
711673	714596	It just sucks because it kind of came out of nowhere.
714636	716838	Supposedly, Live365 sent an email a month ago.
716978	717238	I don't know.
717358	719640	I never got it, so whatever.
720020	723964	They're upping these rates, and even if we could afford it, we kind of don't want to.
724684	727547	We've made a decision that we will be leaving Live365 effective April 12th.
731936	739321	and so that really sucks because that means the feed that we started in May of 2002 is going away.
740201	742923	And I wish this was an April Fool's joke, chat.
743003	743443	It's not.
743463	744884	This is completely legitimate.
744904	749026	It is not an April Fool's joke like a preemptive strike or something because it's not even April yet.
750087	752728	But we have no choice but to leave Life365.
754178	755619	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
778114	779816	We found out about this 30 minutes to an hour ago.
797717	826700	so we're still trying to kind of scramble too but regardless our live feed will be closing effective April 12th meaning that those of you guys that listen at work to the lovely video game music that plays all day long and the retro lunch and all that it's going away and what I feel most horrible for are the other live folks that we've had bless our stream with their presence for their hard work in live shows over the years including
827671	845628	DMN, including Travis Donovan, of course, including, you know, Extifer back when he had his show, including the three of us that do our spinoff shows when we feel like it, and the things that we had planned that we wanted to do with the live feed that now we're, all those plans are effectively off, unfortunately.
846212	873832	and obviously we'll do whatever we can for our friends that broadcast as well but we have to kind of like our number one priority right now is relocating our Sunday show first and then we'll see what we can do after that so Actdeft asks what's going to happen to DM Insanity and TDL I hope they keep going I hope they keep going somehow but unfortunately Orange Lounge Radio won't be around for them to do that with so
875057	881841	Orange Lounge Radio kind of ends in a way on April 12th because Orange Lounge Radio was the radio station.
881921	887704	This show is actually Orange Lounge Radio Live, but obviously over the years it's just been Orange Lounge Radio.
888285	890466	So yeah, I don't know.
891066	893668	The next week's going to be very interesting.
893928	895349	So that's the news.
895982	900823	If you have suggestions or offers, I guess, I don't know, send us an email.
900863	907065	You can contact me in my personal email box, rob at orangelaunchrader.com or our general email bag, mailbag at orangelaunchrader.com.
908485	910146	We think we know what we want to do.
910226	913587	We think we know the option that makes the most sense to us, but it involves other people.
913627	914867	We have to make sure they want to do it too.
915347	917428	So that's that.
918288	919649	You got anything else you guys want to add?
920009	920289	I don't know.
920309	920889	I've kind of been dying.
920909	921209	I don't know.
921229	923790	If you don't like what's going on, you send your emails.
923850	924550	I'd say the life...
926299	934067	And then, you know, in turn, they hopefully will send emails to whomever is charging them, you know.
934428	939433	Unfortunately, I think that they probably know what's going to happen because they're raising all the rates on their stations.
939533	943237	Obviously, a lot of people are just going to forego paying those rates and just quit.
943457	943577	Mm-hmm.
944289	948031	or find elsewhere, and that's unfortunately... I imagine we're not the only station that's doing this.
948192	961700	And I'm sure that they didn't have, you know, it wasn't really their choice to do that, but that's kind of, they have to... It does go back to the royalty things you've probably heard about from the past year, at least that's what they're blaming it on, but I still think it was kind of a bit out of left field.
961720	965543	Because they're taking advantage of that situation for their own personal gain.
965663	967344	I can't help but feel there's a little of that going on.
967364	971046	Anything you want to add, Jamie, as somebody who's been a live broadcaster for this long?
971807	971907	Um...
973143	973563	Not really.
973763	975044	Not that it hasn't already been said.
975724	977365	So, it sucks.
977585	977785	Wah, wah.
977845	978645	I'll make some refuse.
979906	982027	No.
982107	986868	RossDLUT says, Live365 is simply using the RAA boogeyman as an excuse to screw people.
989209	992951	I don't want to knock them right now, but let me put it this way.
993815	997158	We have the money to keep going if we wanted to.
997238	1000721	We could do the 60 listener limit, but we just kind of don't want to.
1000781	1003062	We think we can do – this is more of an incentive.
1003122	1007266	It kind of shows us that like, hey, Orange Launch Radio, you guys have been kind of lazy the past six years.
1007306	1012069	Just stay on on Life's Just Five because it was convenient and it was there, and you could just touch a button and everything is all set up.
1012490	1016753	So this is really going to kind of force us to explore alternatives, and it could be exciting.
1016793	1019515	It could be the beginning of big change, big change.
1019716	1021177	When one door closes, another opens.
1021317	1022077	Absolutely right.
1022278	1022778	I was just going to –
1023493	1024294	Check us out.
1024314	1025897	This is also another option right here.
1025957	1029742	They have actually people that do hosting for our unlimited listeners.
1030203	1030583	We'll see.
1031124	1031284	Maybe.
1031324	1031645	We'll see.
1031825	1032326	Maybe, maybe.
1032747	1033047	I don't know.
1034249	1035691	So we'll see over the next week.
1035771	1037614	We're exploring lots and lots of ideas.
1038942	1039462	So that's that.
1039522	1041943	Obviously our number one priority is keeping this show going.
1042343	1047184	I don't think that many people's worlds will be crushed without a 24-7 music feed.
1047804	1050585	I apologize to those that have been listening to our 24-7 music feed.
1050605	1055706	I know there are some that do, but obviously Sunday shows the priority for us right now.
1056567	1057227	So we'll see.
1058047	1058307	All right.
1059318	1060059	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1082850	1084512	All right, let's get into other housekeeping tonight.
1084532	1088697	The other housekeeping tonight, of course, a happy Easter or whatever it is you celebrate today.
1089958	1091760	If nothing at all, then happy Sunday to you.
1092140	1097566	To all of our Orange Lounge Radio listeners, yes, we are here live on Easter because everybody, I guess, did their stuff this morning.
1097606	1100469	I went to the Bay Area this weekend, had a very lovely weekend in San Francisco.
1100490	1100830	It was good.
1101810	1102491	Thank you for watching!
1119525	1120486	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1144605	1173259	and the thing is that they do Rocky Horror Picture Show and I've been involved with that for a long time you know the show I did before Orange Lounge Radio actually started because of Travis and I's mutual love of Rocky Horror Picture Show under Station Live I still am involved with that not as heavily as I used to be but I still respect the scene and the counterculture that it provides this is very rare to have this show on the big screen this is probably the only time this year outside of a convention this will show on the big screen anywhere
1173599	1175041	Gary Shale, Oscar Drill, Live at the Show
1193809	1194609	The Orange Lounge Radio Wiki
1224053	1225494	Jamie, I showed you that before the show.
1225554	1226955	Isn't that awesome, the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki?
1227015	1228736	I love it, but you're missing some jokes.
1230338	1231679	You need to go old school.
1231719	1235782	We have, like, you know, death cake.
1236942	1244028	There's lots of old school jokes, but I've got to say, I'm very impressed with the work that the folks that have been working on the Wiki have done.
1244068	1249391	Again, the place that the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki is at, orangeloungeradio.wikia.com.
1251855	1256401	and just to give you an idea what's there, and this is all the listeners that have been doing this.
1256422	1256982	This is incredible.
1257323	1264212	They have a page of like inside jokes from the show that includes like the Loki is tingle bet and just some of the other things that have come up on the show.
1264813	1265574	And there's been...
1267594	1269776	They can hear the plane over the live feed right?
1269796	1270757	Can they hear that on the podcast?
1270777	1271897	Are they hearing that on Justin.TV?
1272258	1274559	Probably Justin.TV because the mic's right by the window.
1274579	1275660	Oh, yeah, because the window's open.
1275700	1276861	Yeah, they probably can hear the plane outside.
1277141	1280264	Okay, yes, we live by an Air Force base.
1280584	1281285	Well, it's not actually.
1281345	1282686	It's a helicopter.
1282726	1284027	It was an Air Force base.
1284107	1285228	It used to be an Air Force base.
1285308	1285928	Is it CHP?
1286028	1287510	Oh, somebody's breaking the law.
1287530	1288170	We don't live that far.
1288250	1288690	Sorry.
1288811	1291433	Isn't it now like a business airport is what they use it for primarily?
1291453	1292073	Yeah, it's a commercial airport.
1292093	1292974	Like FedEx and air shows.
1293094	1293915	Yeah, and air shows.
1293935	1294795	Oh, God, the air shows.
1295216	1295696	Oh, God.
1296877	1300718	I mean, the Blue Angels kind of get old to me after the first couple times and they're so loud.
1301139	1304000	I used to go see the Blue Angels when I was a kid, okay?
1304020	1305980	That's how fucking old they are.
1306061	1307521	It's just, really.
1307681	1314944	No, we've always lived by the airport, but now it's just tonight the window's open because it's hot here now, so we have the fan on in the window.
1315044	1316765	Yeah, I think it's bad now.
1316785	1319446	It only gets to like 110 outside.
1319806	1322987	By the way, I found out the information for you in an air conditioner.
1323687	1324307	Alright, excellent.
1324508	1325628	We'll talk about that later.
1326035	1326495	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1353802	1355663	DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week
1380396	1380616	BD Live
1403574	1416241	and it will allow you to do different things with your movies including they will have additional downloadable interactive content as well as like interactive games with leaderboards and that kind of stuff.
1416361	1421644	All stuff that you can kind of throw together on a Blu-ray disc which is pretty cool.
1422164	1429508	Other cool stuff that they're enhancing, you'll be able to play DivX in Windows Media files larger than 2 GB.
1431230	1435613	Also, the music and photo playlist can be exported from the PS3 to the PSP.
1437134	1440937	DVDs and Blu-rays will resume playback for the moment you last stopped them.
1441477	1446301	The PSP can be used as a remote control to play music on the PS3.
1447222	1454647	And the web browser will feature a faster page loading times and the ability to save links and stream linked videos.
1455828	1456348	That's pretty cool.
1456937	1464459	and also I guess another thing they called Mosquito Noise Reduction will be added to AV Control Panel for Blu-rays and DVDs.
1465599	1469261	I don't know what the fuck that last part is, but I'm sure someone out there does.
1471561	1472641	I have no idea what that means either.
1473242	1473822	What was that called?
1473862	1474462	Mosquito?
1474562	1475822	Mosquito Noise Reduction.
1476102	1480444	My guess may be like... Is that to like filter out the planes that fly by while you're watching the movies?
1480724	1481604	I don't know about that one.
1481997	1484219	Maybe like line humming or something like that.
1484260	1485601	It removes the hum off the line.
1485961	1486342	Interesting.
1486362	1488624	Well, I thought Blu-ray was supposed to be perfect anyway.
1488825	1490646	What the hell is there doing line noise?
1490727	1495191	Your Blu-ray may be perfect, but your theater setup may not be perfect.
1495592	1496072	Ah, I see.
1496132	1496473	Okay.
1497254	1497514	All right.
1498783	1501604	And my god, that sun is so fucking bright.
1501684	1501984	I know.
1502144	1502904	Through that window.
1503044	1504884	I'm just like blinded by that.
1505404	1508505	I'm sure the Justin TV people that are watching us on there can see.
1508905	1511985	But as we're taping, you know, just the way the sun is.
1512005	1512285	I'm just fine.
1512645	1517166	The sun is shining like right on Loki and I during the entirety of tonight's show.
1517186	1518186	I'm hiding in shadows.
1518847	1519947	Yes, we know, DarkSakura.
1519967	1520267	We know.
1520667	1521047	You know what?
1521107	1523327	Why don't you just like duct tape a towel up there?
1524087	1524648	That's cool.
1525588	1526608	Loki's just re-situating.
1526628	1527108	I'm moving the sun.
1527631	1531396	See, what'll be funny is that then later the sun will move slowly and hit you in the eyes again.
1532317	1533158	Isn't it going that way?
1533398	1535540	Well, like last week, it kind of went down.
1535801	1537923	It's shining through the last window right now.
1538404	1540927	Constant exposure to your eyes will eventually give me a headache.
1541187	1541367	Yes.
1541548	1542809	And I'm already starting to get one.
1543069	1544331	Maybe that's why I had a headache earlier.
1544371	1544671	I don't know.
1545352	1545773	Stories!
1546013	1546794	Alright, anyway, sorry.
1547901	1548922	PSP 3.93 Internet Radio Feature
1567026	1568027	and that's really it.
1568187	1574329	Although I imagine it probably closed some loopholes in the hacking world but my other question would be has this already been hacked, Loki?
1574810	1586175	No, it hasn't because really all it did was add just those 20 stations so they have a workaround to add those 20 stations if you want but otherwise they're not worrying about cracking it because it's basically just that.
1587776	1595099	That seems a little silly to do a whole firmware upgrade just to add those better be 20 damn good stations 20 damn good stations better be in there
1597682	1600363	I don't know, does 3 Speech have their own radio station?
1600403	1610825	I'm sure No, I think all games where we're syndicated on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings I think they're on there So that's all you really need, right?
1611265	1616067	We're not on there because Live 365 doesn't go on Shoutcast So we've been paying all that money, why?
1617167	1624909	When we can't even get listed on PSPs Oh, forget it It's old hat now Things are going to be changing soon I have two words for that
1625715	1629378	Alpha Canogram says it's not stations, it's players.
1630499	1632842	So I guess I'm what, like different skins and stuff?
1634043	1634943	Well, that's even lamer.
1637265	1638186	Tony, play us.
1638947	1641529	Rosteel UT says OLR should be on three-speech radio.
1642210	1642870	That would be fun.
1643631	1646694	Then we could talk about all the great things in the Sony world and nothing else.
1647543	1649344	Let's talk about all the good things in the Sony world.
1649364	1650964	And our show would be only five minutes long.
1651024	1654106	Hey, I have some great things in the Sony world to talk about.
1654126	1655566	All right, then please do share.
1656226	1658127	More like Sony being fucking stupid.
1658447	1659028	Ha ha.
1659508	1659988	No, um.
1660928	1679604	basically EA put out a patch for the orange box on PS3 that's supposed to address these problems with connectivity and frame rate issues and slow loading times but they haven't put out any other documentation to really say what else it's supposed to do and the thing is like 128 meg so it's kind of big and
1683900	1685321	No one else really knows what else it does.
1685441	1690763	And the whole thing is, it's not really Valve that did it, it's from their third party, so, whatever.
1693484	1701408	Well, at least it's not like, um, I was gonna say, like, Bully got patched recently, and apparently the patch didn't do anything.
1701768	1705470	See, see, see, Valve, this is what you get for having software on PlayStation 3.
1705730	1708171	I don't know, RustyLUT in chat says the patch does nothing.
1709895	1713196	Well, they said what the patch did, it's just, um, I don't know.
1713216	1713976	It's supposed to do.
1714637	1726561	Well, I am looking that up right now, because I don't remember off the top of my head, because I don't own the PS3 version of the Orange Box, and you know me, I don't care about anybody but myself, so, I don't know.
1726601	1735444	Well, I don't have the PS3 version either, I have the Xbox 360 version, and keep in mind, the only version worth having is either PC or Xbox 360.
1735844	1739425	PlayStation 3 is, it's not meant to be online.
1741359	1742960	I guess that's true.
1766380	1794764	and I don't know if they're going to actually scale it back resolution wise I mean after all they did allow them to break the barrier for Street Fighter 2 HD Turbo Remix whatever the fuck it's called now I think that that was the last announced thing though that they were having to scale it back because the game wasn't quite working at the full resolution I'm sure Microsoft will let them bend the rules a little bit to make it work with a big game like that okay
1795598	1799520	Anyways, since we've wasted enough time, now I can tell you what was in that patch.
1800481	1808466	They fixed graphical issues where a player would have the explosion effect left on the end of their rocket launcher while attempting to rocket jump.
1809166	1810767	Some memory leaks fixed.
1811187	1815250	Fixed an issue where the player's name would not appear on the stats comparison screen.
1816551	1821994	There's an issue that would cause the vote tallies to disappear when you viewed a scoreboard between rounds.
1822574	1823735	Online server issue.
1823755	1825016	Um...
1826799	1832303	An issue with players not always being added to the player's menu across MediaBar.
1834085	1839969	Fixed a bug where a player viewing a friend without an EA account would have an empty entry in their friend's leaderboard.
1840610	1846195	And fixed an issue where it was not possible to connect to EA's servers if you have more than 30 friends.
1846715	1855182	So it sounds like they fixed a lot of issues, but nothing really important like frame rate issues or anything that really needed to be fixed.
1857930	1858811	Huh, unfortunate.
1858831	1860572	You know, speaking of Valve, you know what I checked out?
1861192	1865495	Finally, after all this time, and I know some of you guys are going to be like, oh my god, Rob, you're behind the times.
1865915	1868557	I finally downloaded and checked out Steam this week.
1869518	1870278	After all this time.
1870339	1872060	It's a nice little front-end program.
1872120	1876743	It kind of reminds me of X-Fire, but like with game purchases available inside it.
1877043	1881086	And I actually thought about getting Portal, just so I can have it on the computer.
1881626	1885009	Because I'm a sucker for that game, as a lot of people are, what can I say?
1885029	1885069	Um,
1887691	1888311	Persona 4 Persona 4
1906989	1908510	All sorts of stuff from the new game.
1908750	1912072	Apparently, Persona 4 is coming to Japan in July.
1912813	1917636	Interesting enough, it's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 and not the PS3.
1918797	1920177	So, it's pretty cool.
1920297	1924900	And it looks, you know, to me, I think it looks 100 times better than Persona 3.
1925241	1928963	So, I'm sure a lot of people will be very happy about that.
1929303	1934206	No word of what's coming over to the US, but seeing as they've brought over Persona 3 and Persona 3 FES...
1936465	1937466	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1967657	1973463	That is pretty interesting that they're packing all that in a PlayStation 2 game, you know what I mean?
1973563	1978228	That they're still cranking them out for the quote-unquote old system.
1978348	1981531	But, you know, I guess there's still tons and tons of PS2s out there.
1981571	1984574	It's still one of the better-selling game systems, eh?
1985175	1985455	Yeah.
1985635	1986015	Why not?
1986796	1987557	I guess it makes sense.
1989192	1989872	Thanks for watching!
2011187	2013508	It has some more in common with Street Fighter 2.
2013928	2019849	This game is starting to sound more and more like just another Street Fighter 2 port, but just like completely new graphics and everything.
2020029	2020309	Really?
2020389	2023430	Just like Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.
2025510	2031372	Well, but yet, you know, it's got the whole, it's 3D-ish element and, you know, the whole new characters and all that.
2031392	2036153	So, you know, the fighter guy and the, what was her name?
2036573	2037033	Crimson...
2038215	2039316	Viper, whatever her name was.
2040917	2041798	I think it'll be very cool.
2042058	2054526	But the news that was announced this week is that not only are there some small cosmetic changes in the game, but that the old combos will work exactly the same way in the new game.
2054926	2056728	And that means the old combos from Street Fighter 2.
2058769	2066134	And if you got a Guile combo down that you used to use in Street Fighter 2, apparently you can use them in Street Fighter 4 as well.
2067361	2070564	I love Killer Instinct.
2095069	2100313	But that's just... Have you ever played against, though, one of those people who are just like the combo people?
2100953	2101794	It's painful.
2101954	2107838	You know, strangely enough, not so much in Street Fighter II, but in Mortal Kombat, I used to get those people all the time, and it used to piss me off.
2108218	2113642	I was one of those people on the beta version, though, just because I learned Kitana's infinite combo.
2114222	2116104	Which was funny, because people get mad.
2116344	2116584	Anyway...
2117136	2119418	Speaking of pain... I gotta say this real quick in chat.
2119458	2122921	Rob D says, uh, there's no way they could get away with skipping those combos.
2122941	2123682	This is nothing new.
2123722	2125203	They never change mechanics that much.
2126184	2129267	True, but when you consider the age of Street Fighter 2, you know what I mean?
2130347	2131328	It's kinda, kinda cool.
2131909	2132750	Can I get on with the pain?
2132830	2133170	You may.
2133470	2133991	Bring on the pain.
2135172	2143319	Well, pain is gonna be on PlayStation Network, um, at least for, uh, the PAL PSN, um, for, uh, 499 pounds.
2143339	2143379	Um...
2145598	2149119	Basically, it's a game where you throw stuff for points.
2150520	2152641	I can't really describe it much else than that.
2152941	2153801	Didn't you buy Pain?
2154501	2154621	No.
2155121	2155882	I thought you did.
2155982	2157082	I have not bought anything.
2157162	2162164	Well, other than Flow, I bought that on there.
2162364	2168686	But other than that, I have not bought a game on the PSN because I do not like their payment method.
2168886	2170167	It's like jackass in the game.
2170227	2171367	I don't like using real money.
2171567	2172208	I like points.
2172568	2172988	Sorry, Jamie.
2173994	2183237	Basically, the whole point of pain is that, you know, you're causing misfortune in people, and people grow up and laugh at them.
2183717	2184617	They get laughed at.
2184817	2187978	So basically, that's sort of what pain is about.
2188698	2202082	Anyway, to get back to the story, there are also additional packs that are 69 pence each, and it will be the Scurvdog Muffy pack.
2202521	2207344	Santa, Hung Lo, Ginger, Cookie, and Fun With Explosives packs.
2208185	2209545	The last one is supposed to be a freebie.
2210246	2215469	You know, but any game that combines Santa and Fun With Explosives you think would be instant win.
2215689	2218291	If they had a band, it would be named Fun With Explosives.
2222834	2223174	Really?
2224174	2228897	But also, the store also has the Stranglehold pack for $9.99. $9.99.
2230536	2232157	That's, again, in pounds.
2232877	2235538	That has multiplayer maps.
2235598	2237679	It actually should be the one they got on Xbox Live.
2238559	2240579	You should see if that name is taken in Rock Band.
2241360	2242300	Fun with explosives.
2243240	2248902	Well, if not, then I would be stealing the one from Clerks that Dan came up with this morning.
2249002	2249402	What's that?
2249522	2250143	Making Fuck.
2252063	2253024	It's probably taken.
2253764	2254344	I wouldn't doubt it.
2254484	2258125	I think I have the name Emergency Kittens, but there's no one in the band.
2258746	2259946	So, whatever.

2371729	2376111	Does Ninja Gaiden still have the epic cinema scenes like the old school games have?
2376131	2376731	I'm not sure.
2377172	2378472	God, I hope so, on the DS.
2378552	2384395	It is the DS, but the whole game is controlled with the stylus, so that's pretty cool.
2385475	2386276	And let's see here.
2386776	2391498	We've also got just some more crap here.
2393105	2396147	I guess, oh, this is also coming out on the 31st.

2407874	2408854	Yeah, for right now.
2409014	2414137	And I know next week there's absolutely shit coming out, so... Enjoy it while you last.

2479091	2482095	Here's a spoiler for Japan, Nitro Bike sucks.
2482655	2483637	And how do you know that?
2484077	2486140	Because I played it and it sucks.
2486886	2487746	What Sucks About It
2514358	2518600	GS68, by the way, refers to one of the earlier titles we mentioned in chat.
2519100	2520821	He says, Golden Kump Ass.
2522242	2522522	Get it?
2523182	2524523	Golden Kump Ass.
2525803	2540010	PlayStation 2 sees Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus comes out, as well as Neo Angelique Full Voice in a premium box and a super premium box, as well as the original.
2541767	2549033	Silent Hill Origins makes its way to some Asian regions this week, but Korea is the only one we see mentioned, so be sure to check.
2549093	2551995	It might be a little bit longer before it makes its way to Japan.
2553036	2558140	Nobunaga no Yabu Online comes out in Japan this week as well.
2559020	2559761	Lots of fun stuff.

2574272	2579096	Bungle Shiki Taisen Battle Sugoruku comes out.
2579156	2579616	Baseball game.
2580336	2583198	I like that it says Hitman Reborn in it, in the middle of it, though.
2586881	2588281	Kind of makes me think of a different type of game.
2588302	2589542	Maybe it's baseball with Hitman.
2589562	2590103	That would be fun.
2590323	2590523	No.
2591469	2592869	They need Battlefield Baseball.
2592929	2593830	That'd be pretty awesome.
2594510	2594830	Let's see.
2594910	2598311	Simple DS Series gets volume 35, the Genshin this week.
2599011	2600991	Lost in Blue 2 gets a price reduction.

2616038	2617159	PSP.
2617279	2619419	Check in real quick to see if anything's coming out of note there.
2619820	2623621	Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G. That might be kind of cool.
2624162	2627763	As well as Tomb Raider Anniversary comes out on the Sony PSP.
2627823	2628604	That's it for Japan.
2630524	2631125	That's all.
2631445	2636387	Okay, well I have for our UK listeners another set of release dates.
2637412	2639833	On the 27th, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.
2641834	2643395	You've heard us talk about this, so don't worry about it.
2644435	2645916	The Golden Horde on PC.
2646937	2663204	On the 28th, we have Coded Arms Contagion, Football Manager 2008, God of War, Chains of Olympus, King of Clubs, Naruto, Clash of Ninja Revolution, Powershot Pinball Constructor, which sounds pretty fun, that's on DS.
2664051	2680136	Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on Wii, Sega Bass Fishing, Universe at War Earth Assault, Viking Battle for Asgard, Warriors of the Lost Empire, Warriors Orochi on PC and PSP, and Worms Space Oddity.
2682896	2683116	Cool.
2684097	2684897	That would be it.
2686349	2689152	Coming out here not very soon, but soon enough.
2689593	2695999	In June, Activision actually announced that they will be bringing Guitar Hero on tour to the Nintendo DS.
2696620	2699042	Now, you may be wondering, how the hell are they going to do that?
2699142	2703667	Well, there's actually a brand new peripheral that they're releasing along with it called the Guitar Grip.
2704147	2708612	It has four fret buttons and a wonderful little hand strap to put your hand through.
2709119	2713620	So you use that just like you would, you know, the fret buttons on an actual guitar.
2714300	2721682	And then you strum on the touch screen with a stylus, or actually a pick stylus that comes with the game to do that kind of stuff.
2722322	2724923	And of course, you know, plays just like Guitar Hero.
2725303	2729024	It's supposed to have 20 songs, or more than 20 songs in the game.
2729364	2732244	And 80% of the songs will be original master recordings.
2733285	2734385	So that's pretty cool.
2734405	2734485	I've
2735609	2739552	My memory serves me right, it's $49.99, comes out June 22nd.
2740453	2742094	Oh, just in time for my birthday!
2743255	2746477	By the way, they've wasted no time in whoring this game to the masses.
2746537	2753823	I don't know if you guys ever visit Yahoo.com, like just, you know, out of the blue, but it's one of the pages I'll go to, you know, for like news and search and stuff.
2754263	2756805	And there's a little flash ad that pops right up there.
2756905	2759027	It's already whoring the Guitar Hero on tour.
2759067	2759427	Oh yeah.
2759487	2760628	They are wasting no time.
2761164	2772381	And I would recommend pre-ordering this if you're really interested in it because like most other Activision games that include peripherals, especially brand new peripherals that they're breaking ground on, this thing will be hard to find.
2773683	2776928	Frisbee asks, is anyone honestly going to buy this crap?
2777734	2779196	I actually have mine pre-ordered already.
2779396	2783340	But I'm not going to probably play it because that's what I do.
2784702	2785903	It looks interesting.
2786023	2787945	I'm interested enough where I at least want to play it.
2788005	2789527	I don't know if I want to drop, what you said, $49.95?
2789807	2789527	$49.99.
2789867	2794212	I don't know if I want to drop $50 on it, especially if it's only 20 songs.
2794292	2796294	But I'm interested in checking it out.
2797990	2798330	I don't know.
2798350	2799091	I think it's neat.
2799171	2805376	I don't think it would be that difficult if it's only four buttons if I can already play five-button mode on the... Dude, Konami really missed out, man.
2805396	2807357	They could have done Guitar Freeze with three buttons.
2807377	2808959	I'm saying that for a long time.
2808999	2809559	Just saying.
2810520	2810820	All right.
2811240	2812221	Well, I'm interested.
2812261	2812982	Actually, I'm interested.
2813022	2813782	Let me ask chat.
2814062	2817965	How many folks in chat are interested in picking this game up?
2818226	2819126	Guitar Hero on tour.
2819186	2825311	Quick poll of chat because I imagine most of you that own DSs or if you don't own a DS, imagine you did.
2825371	2826312	Would you pick up this game?
2828522	2831123	and Frisbee says, please just smack yourself.
2831203	2832264	Elite Beat Agents.
2832664	2833264	Okay, thanks.
2834865	2836766	Oh, I feel so sorry for Elite Beat Agents.
2836786	2839167	I was in Fry's the other day and that game's like on clearance.
2839528	2839728	Yeah.
2839808	2840628	Tons and tons of copies.
2840648	2841529	You can't buy it anymore, actually.
2841569	2842149	It's kind of sad.
2842169	2842909	It's so sad.
2842969	2843990	That game is awesome.
2845751	2853757	But, you know, hey, here's the thing, and I don't know if you should start getting worried about this or not, but they're really whoring Guitar Hero out.
2853937	2864725	I mean, Activision, I don't know if they're going to drive it into the ground or what, but, I mean, we've got, actually, literally a week after this, Guitar Hero Aerosmith coming out.
2865265	2872130	Then you've got Guitar Hero 4, and who knows how many other shit, you know, games that they're going to throw in the middle there.
2872605	2877069	They're really whoring that franchise out, and people are kind of really buying into it, unfortunately.
2877229	2879851	Alright, let's look at our instant poll results in chatroom.
2879891	2883213	I'm not going to read the nicknames because that will take me too long, but really quickly, here's some of the comments.
2883574	2887437	Question was, are you going to buy Guitar Hero on Tour DS?
2887997	2888418	I'm not.
2889438	2888418	0%.
2889699	2889979	No.
2890659	2890940	No.
2891380	2891900	Not me.
2893141	2894843	Just get a PSP and DJ Max.
2895523	2896624	Depends on the song list.
2897165	2897585	Maybe.
2897605	2897705	Maybe.
2899033	2901796	Only for the peripheral to make it easier to play Puzzle League.
2902516	2903457	Strap for the win.
2904838	2907840	If the game has songs I like, I might download, I mean pick it up.
2909922	2913705	I may get it if they guarantee cheap expansion pack song cards minus peripheral.
2916247	2917368	Never, ever, ever, ever.
2919609	2922772	I will purchase Guitar Hero on tour after I'm done burning $100 bills.
2923833	2926034	No, nope, you'd look like a damn fool playing it.
2926415	2928196	No, no, not ripped off.
2928846	2929808	and Khan.
2932031	2933734	There's your instant poll results.
2934155	2939924	Well, I was just thinking, I mean, this is a good game for kids, you know, especially when you're taking them on the road and stuff.
2939944	2941086	They can play their Guitar Hero.
2941522	2942443	Thanks for watching!
2960456	2962417	Look, you can play Guitar Hero in the car.
2962497	2963057	Have fun.
2963077	2963757	Shut up.
2963777	2966198	The only reason I'm buying it is so we can show it on the show.
2966258	2967718	That's pretty much the only reason.
2967919	2968979	Oh, don't waste your money.
2969299	2973140	Well, hey, just because I ordered it doesn't mean I'm going to actually buy it, okay?
2973180	2975561	Because I don't have to.
2975581	2978322	I just put it on order to kind of hold my spot.
2980703	2983404	RossDLUT says, Loki, you're high.
2983484	2986825	They'll bug mommy even more with this game by singing along.
2988444	2990946	No, maybe my wife would do that, but, you know.
2993187	2995029	Just don't put songs with words in them.
2995349	2995789	There you go.
2996510	2996870	Alright.
2998291	3002294	Let's go into more lawsuit news from Gibson.
3002334	3008018	We already kind of talked about this last week, but if you can believe it, even more lawsuits coming out from Gibson.
3008038	3017205	You remember Gibson sued Activision, they sued Harmonix last week, all over the fact that Gibson says they have had a patent for electronic guitars for...
3019541	3033948	And get this, this week, now they've sued GameStop, Walmart, Target, Kmart, Amazon, Toys R Us All these major retailers that sell Guitar Hero games Seeking basically to stop the sale of the games Did you see they also sued EA?
3034409	3046055	Even though EA doesn't make Guitar Hero at all It's crazy, yeah I was going to say in the next piece here They sued Harmonix, Viacom, and EA now as well
3048041	3051404	Just because I guess they want to sue as many people as possible.
3052985	3053906	I don't understand this.
3053926	3054986	This makes no sense at all.
3055427	3055767	I don't know.
3056267	3057128	They're looking for money.
3057969	3061832	But why would you sue the retailers to get them to try to stop selling the game?
3062712	3064534	Because they're trying to make a big stink.
3064554	3066155	They're trying to file an injunction.
3066175	3069077	They're trying to make a big stink and seeing who will give them money.
3070358	3072360	Loki says the EA suit is over Rock Band.
3073800	3078804	I don't know if it's over Rock Band because they mentioned Guitar Hero in the lawsuit.
3078844	3079845	It's not Rock Band.
3080886	3084669	Is it because now Harmonix is a part of... Oh no, I guess it was just an agreement.
3084769	3085129	I don't know.
3085789	3086330	That just sucked.
3086390	3087391	Let's sue everything.
3088071	3089592	I like that comment from Gerardimo in chat.
3089893	3093816	Well, you gotta wonder, is this Gibson thing legitimate or not?
3093936	3095657	And there's actually an analyst out there.
3095677	3097398	Of course, we love analysts.
3097799	3101101	But this is actually a legal analyst working for...
3102509	3112873	Wedbush Morgan, he's an analyst, he says this about the lawsuits, quote, this is, Michael Pastors' name, quote, this is a poorly masked attempt to extort money.
3113253	3116714	They are using any way they can to have Activision write them a check.
3117615	3124758	I mean, seriously, this is the third game, I mean, well, the third major release of the game that's been out so far.
3125058	3130220	I think at one time they had Gibson guitars in the game, I want to say, I don't know, I may be wrong.
3130960	3131080	Um,
3131752	3132752	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3156337	3165067	It was Konami, and if I remember correctly, I thought Activision was licensing the rights to use that from Konami, and not Gibson.
3169772	3173856	All I gotta say is the next fucking guitar games you guys put out, just forget about Gibson.
3173896	3177380	There's plenty of other guitar manufacturers out there you can license guitars for.
3183137	3189800	Well, anyhow, this news, I know, makes me angsty every time I hear about this, and I'm sure you guys feel the same way.
3190220	3193261	So you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.
3199763	3200123	Um...
3210430	3227214	Well, I guess life 365 goes without saying, so I'm not gonna really go too much in depth on that, um, but F you to, um, having way too many people in the house when I had a doffy to work on.
3228014	3231695	Suddenly got her blushed and I haven't finished with the rest of her face.
3234655	3237016	Uh, F you to, um,
3237759	3238139	I don't know.
3238159	3238700	That fucking sucks.
3260025	3262567	FU to Live365, goes without saying.
3263067	3272413	In fact, I think when this show comes back in a non-Live365 place, we should actually probably rename this segment to the Live365 Memorial FUs of the Week.
3274514	3275215	That might be fun.
3276155	3279938	I don't know, but also I want to give an FU to the cat scan I had on Thursday.
3279978	3280878	It was so miserable.
3280898	3286382	And look, I still have a bruise from where they gave me the little shot thingy, or the iodine thing, bleh.
3287697	3288858	I hate, oh, it was so miserable.
3289138	3290739	So miserable, I reacted so bad to it.
3291579	3295121	So, yeah, I had to have a CAT scan because I'm still having those pains that I've been having.
3295561	3297222	And they're not going away, which sucks.
3297503	3300064	And I don't get the results back till Monday, so F you to waiting.
3301765	3302285	It does sucks.
3303726	3305747	I'll tell you what, though, this is the best diet I've ever been on.
3305787	3308209	I'll eat, like, a couple things and I get extremely full.
3308689	3311550	It's like I had gastric bypass or something without having to pay for it.
3311911	3312311	It's great.
3313820	3315200	Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week.
3315220	3317281	Let's get back to some gaming news.
3318562	3323663	And, wow, we have almost like a whole segment of music game news, don't we, Jamie?
3324384	3325284	Yeah, how's that?
3325384	3328585	Right, you know, before they're screwing us over.
3328725	3339729	Anyway, MTV has said that they've sold, what was it, more than 6 million, I think, songs and rock band as downloadable content.
3340860	3346219	So now Harmonix is bringing in the Rock Band Music Store for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3347588	3354651	so that you can actually download your songs in-game without leaving the game.
3355351	3364214	And so you can sort them by artist, genre, album, title, pack, and other ways, too.
3364254	3365175	There's album art.
3365955	3369897	You can listen to song previews and difficulty levels.
3371157	3373738	And the patch is actually supposed to be out this week.
3374999	3375839	Or maybe it's already out.
3377418	3383269	Yeah, the patch had already... Didn't you say that you... I did, and it's lots of fun.
3383309	3385434	Sorry, I just... He's eating toast.
3385634	3385874	I know.
3386476	3389041	I give that F you to not being able to eat, and then I'm eating.
3391880	3392521	Excuse me, sorry.
3392921	3399646	So, yeah, I did download the music store, and it's actually kind of cool because you get the little album art, and you can download the song previews now.
3399706	3406350	So, like, if you're not sure exactly what a song is, like, I think I've heard that song, but I'm not sure, you can download the little song previews, and it stays on there.
3406831	3410413	So when you're scrolling in the list in the future, you can kind of hear it like it was DDR or something.
3411923	3415884	Actually, the music store kind of looks like a DDR selection screen to me, I don't know.
3416144	3428186	I like the fact that you can actually preview the songs, you know, something that I thought should have been on there in the first place, instead of having to buy these songs blindly, unless you have, like, a YouTube link where you can watch the video or listen to the song.
3429226	3430047	I think that's smart.
3431567	3437008	I think the whole thing was smart because I realized there were songs in there I didn't, like, I wanted that I didn't realize I didn't have.
3437352	3443878	Yeah, because it's hard sometimes, especially when you recognize a song on the radio by the song, not necessarily by the title.
3444438	3446300	Or you might not even know who the artist is.
3446360	3447340	You just recognize the song.
3447741	3449462	Press Start in chat agrees with us.
3449522	3451144	The previews in Rock Band are evil.
3451264	3453406	I downloaded like three more songs because of them.
3454667	3455187	There you have it.
3456808	3464575	Well, there was a little bit more that I saw about them trying to add more features that were based off of requests by the community, so that's pretty cool.
3464875	3465356	It's supposed to be...
3466650	3493905	new content every week through 2008 so that's pretty cool that's of course only in the US right now that's pretty cool you know what I'm surprised they don't have yet is vision camera support or like you know camera support to basically film yourself doing your little rock concert shit you know in front of your TV or whatever with your friends and then posting it like a YouTube thing
3495919	3498420	with some sort of contest maybe lumped in with that.
3499681	3508826	Although at the same time I'm kind of glad they don't have that because that would be a motivation for some other people to try to get me to do things I don't want to do.
3509786	3511227	Let's see here.
3511267	3516149	This week we've got a new download pack coming to Rock Band.
3516530	3524894	It's actually six songs from Boston and quite a few that you'll probably like here.
3525543	3537226	including, let's see here, Hitch a Ride, More Than a Feelin', Peace of Mind, Rock and Roll Band, Smokin', and Somethin' About You.
3538287	3540187	So that's pretty cool.
3541108	3545209	And you can buy that in a pack for 800 Microsoft points, or $10, or individually for 160 Microsoft points, or $1.99 each.
3545249	3547149	So you save $2 if you buy it all.
3554446	3558307	Whatever happened to you getting that rock band stage kit?
3558447	3559307	When is it not out yet?
3559647	3560448	When does that come out?
3560948	3561248	June.
3562548	3563008	June?
3563688	3563948	Yeah.
3563969	3566689	We're going to have to wait that long to rock?
3566889	3568910	And we won't even be able to do it on Live 365?
3568970	3569550	That sucks.
3569850	3570350	Is that right?
3570850	3577632	It's one of those things that we need to have a camera for so we can see the entire garage being filled with smoke.
3578252	3581373	Here's a little clip of Boston if you actually need a reminder.
3586178	3587479	He's the same song that's in Guitar Hero.
3589501	3591742	And I think it's also in Chariots of Revolution.
3597306	3598267	Boston is great.
3599588	3600629	Boston is pretty awesome.
3600709	3603070	I'm telling you, though, I want my Queen pack.
3603311	3604231	My Journey pack.
3604752	3605732	Where's my Journey pack?
3606713	3609215	I need me some Queen, because that'd be awesome.
3611425	3612405	She was funny in Cry Baby.
3639304	3640845	Oh yeah, I love Tracy Lord as an actress.
3641786	3642286	Good stuff.
3642306	3645068	Well, yes, she was on the NBC show.
3645088	3646929	What was it, The Pretenders for the longest time?
3647409	3649470	Oh, I thought you were talking about a fourth.
3649570	3651051	No, no, not that type of actress.
3651512	3655034	Although, you know, sure, people everywhere can appreciate her fine work there.
3655694	3659437	Anyway, something else you folks can appreciate is free stuff.
3659637	3660917	Who doesn't like free stuff?
3661158	3663159	We don't if it's yours.
3664048	3667391	Something, well this isn't Yaris, it's actually on the Nintendo Wii.
3667511	3671295	It's sort of a, we're sorry, please forgive us type of thing.
3671335	3678741	Remember how the whole Wii Guitar Hero, oh excuse me, the whole Guitar Hero, I eat toast and I burp.
3679382	3683205	Remember how the whole Guitar Hero 3 on the Nintendo Wii only had the mono sound in it?
3683485	3686788	And they have to do all these replacement discs for the stereo sound now?
3687249	3691092	Well, you're also going to be getting a Guitar Hero faceplate.
3691934	3693854	A free Guitar Hero faceplate.
3694955	3696355	It's actually kind of neat looking.
3696395	3697895	It looks like fire a little bit.
3698075	3703636	It's red and yellow and black, and it looks like a phoenix kind of rising up from this fire-ish looking thing.
3703736	3704976	So it's kind of cool.
3705036	3705316	I don't know.
3705336	3708017	It's small black leather, and it says, Please don't sue us.
3708117	3708977	Please don't sue us.
3709657	3710897	Please no class action lawsuit.
3711157	3713698	By accepting this faceplate, you agree not to do a class action lawsuit.
3713738	3714058	I don't know.
3714098	3715358	Jamie, don't you think that looks kind of cool?
3715378	3717759	It looks better than the guitar I have in the living room.
3718419	3719119	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
3719399	3719559	Yeah.
3721295	3723717	I hate how the Wiimote goes in the guitar like that.
3723757	3724558	It's so weird.
3725959	3729202	But I guess it makes sense and probably makes things cost less.
3729262	3735467	But anyway, free faceplate for those of you that are going to be getting the replacement discs for Guitar Hero on the Wii.
3735607	3739410	You have to understand, it hijacks Wi-Fi like a college student in an apartment complex.
3742353	3744534	Can we please move on with the gaming news at this time?
3745375	3746256	Sure, why not?
3747512	3748252	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3777378	3787423	They actually were saying that there may be another version, another song pack for Guitar Hero that would be all Beatles stuff.
3788263	3804211	And that's pretty cool, although I've been corrected as far as information in the article that their catalog cannot be distributed on iTunes because of a lawsuit going on between Apple and Apple Corp.
3804251	3804371	So...
3805959	3806960	I'm not going to go into all that.
3807400	3808840	Read Wikipedia.
3810161	3817525	But they said that they're trying to work about bringing a few songs out for a particular song pack, so I think that'd be kind of cool.
3820026	3822607	Don't they have to get the rights back from Michael Jackson?
3822727	3826469	Or did he sell that stuff when he started becoming poorer?
3828070	3829550	I don't know.
3829650	3830731	I'm not the expert.
3832216	3838761	Well, another bad idea sounds like something coming from Ubisoft with their brand new title in their Imagine series.
3838921	3840482	Imagine, people actually buy this shit.
3841263	3842764	Imagine Rockstar.
3843365	3847928	It is absolutely in no way a ripoff of Rockband, I'm sure.
3848809	3854033	And it kind of revolves around fashion and stuff.
3854213	3858376	It's actually, the Imagine series is meant for girls aged 6 to 14.
3860859	3862620	or in the case of Jamie, she likes Imagine Babies.
3863400	3877047	And it will allow little girls, I guess, to be able to play drums, guitar, bass, and piano with each other via Wi-Fi.
3877728	3881409	And each instrument has its own unique control using the DS stylus.
3881590	3888193	And players will be able to customize the look of each bandmate and create the most stylish rockers.
3889048	3890289	Only girls can play?
3890369	3891409	That's not fair.
3891829	3893230	Fine, you two can play.
3893330	3894050	Yay!
3895510	3901172	And they worked their way up the charts to become the number one recording band.
3901372	3902613	How is that different from Rock Band?
3902633	3906394	Don't you get to dress your characters in Rock Band?
3906414	3909015	You have to understand, this is shitty.
3909775	3911516	Rock Band, not so crappy.
3913297	3914257	Oh, I'm so sorry.
3916155	3917756	Imagine MasterChef Imagine MasterChef
3941932	3948615	Let's hear them, I don't want to say defend themselves, but let's hear about their contributions to the gaming scene.
3948675	3949615	I like to hear from the horse's mouth.
3949635	3953136	I make fun of them because it's not my demographic.
3953276	3954196	But you know what?
3955097	3959658	There is a problem with a lot of games not being focused towards girls.
3960239	3962739	And so they are kind of working that market.
3963040	3964760	Same with UFO Interactive.
3965140	3967201	They make a lot of these, like, was it,
3967685	3971948	Smart Boys Game Room, Smart Girls Dream House, type thing like that.
3972829	3975812	It's games that are aimed at kids that are three years old.
3975872	3979034	Like, really get you hooked young.
3979054	3979695	Start them young.
3979995	3980495	Exactly.
3980615	3984018	So, it's nice that they're aiming for this demographic.
3984298	3988882	Obviously, though, it's easy fodder for us in the press to just kind of make fun of it because...
3989488	3991109	We don't understand it, and it's different.
3991249	3993770	Back in my day, we had Mario is Missing, and we liked it.
3994110	4003975	Mario is Missing was great, and besides that, I personally, for some of these, I don't really feel like perpetuating any type of stereotypical behavior or traditional roles.
4004015	4013440	I think that it's up to... It's just like when Nintendo tried Super Princess Peach, and that flopped, and so they said, fuck it, boys will play games, girls will do nothing.
4015618	4016338	I play games.
4016518	4018299	I like Super Princess Peach.
4018359	4019019	Screw you.
4019039	4021100	I like shooting things in games.
4023461	4026762	It's like... You will play your Kirby and your Peach games and you will like them.
4027022	4027402	That's it.
4027502	4028282	No.
4028382	4036305	Now the chat room is just going off with all these different Imagine things, but Amaze Hatsuma, I like this one, says, Imagine these games in a landfill next to E.T.
4038026	4038046	I...
4039022	4040343	I like violent games.
4040383	4042523	Frisbee says Peach is awesome in Brawl.
4042543	4043544	That's actually true.
4044384	4046345	The two characters I use most are Pit and Peach.
4047045	4048806	I don't like the Foo Foo Games.
4049386	4050406	It's like the Peach Pit.
4050906	4051267	Rob!
4051307	4051547	Get it?
4051687	4051907	What?
4052247	4053527	I don't like Foo Foo Games.
4053627	4055488	Why do you think I have to play Foo Foo Games?
4056609	4057389	Because it's funny.
4057589	4058629	I want Explosive Portal.
4058649	4059249	That's the joke.
4059990	4060610	No, it's not.
4060650	4062071	Do you like Final Fantasy Tactics?
4062471	4062691	No.
4063071	4064231	Well, then this is not for you.
4064311	4065532	Final Fantasy Tactics A2!
4066445	4068527	Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII
4095022	4095862	A little bit, I guess.
4095922	4096822	Check that out loosely.
4098103	4100503	Another way to whore that series even more.
4100643	4102464	Stop whoring your Final Fantasy series.
4102484	4103904	Hey, Final Fantasy XII was a good game.
4103944	4106564	Make one game, move to the next number.
4106744	4111185	You do not need to expand upon this series in tactics games.
4111325	4114266	And besides, I mean, I don't know.
4114746	4116246	Revenant Wings, did you play much of that?
4116827	4117147	Not really.
4117527	4117727	Yeah.
4118207	4118467	Okay.
4119587	4121608	Cool, you can be the killer tomato in this game.
4121648	4123208	Or at least I think you fight the killer tomato.
4123228	4123848	That's kind of cool.
4124960	4126581	This game actually looks kind of rad.
4127862	4131884	I still need to beat Final Fantasy XII, though, and that other Final Fantasy game you bought me on DS, Loki.
4133065	4133645	Looks like fun.
4135986	4137907	I'm sure we'll be hearing from our listeners on this game.
4140269	4141810	Oh, we hear from them about everything else.
4142090	4142650	I mean, hi!
4144171	4148974	No, um... We know Codemasters, right?
4149514	4150335	We're familiar with them.
4150675	4150895	Sure.
4151956	4152556	They, um...
4153203	4160449	Codemasters Online Gaming basically said that they want to do two MMOs for home consoles.
4161230	4170937	They were saying that they've had a little bit of success already in the market, and so they're looking to bring stuff out for PlayStation 3.
4170997	4175601	This is one of the ones listed, and they're saying that now is the right time to hop on it.
4177102	4182667	There's not anything specific yet, but they said that they're really going to gear it for the consoles.
4183915	4189117	So, I personally don't think MMOs work very well on consoles unless it's like, you know, PSO.
4189898	4194400	Here's what I'm hoping, and I know they don't make this game, at least not Codemasters.
4195100	4199422	APB, that game that's coming out that's just like Saints Row, but it's an MMO.
4199782	4205185	I hope to God that I don't have to pay month to month for that thing, because I really want to play it, like, badly.
4205505	4207846	Well, most MMOs you do have to pay month to month for.
4207866	4209086	Yeah, but Guild Wars you don't, okay?
4209186	4212528	And they really need to follow that line of thought there.
4213217	4215098	Everybody, look at Guild Wars.
4215418	4215958	Look at it.
4217658	4217818	Learn it.
4217838	4217978	Love it.
4218018	4222940	There's a lot of games out there that are free to play and you buy download content.
4223000	4223620	That's what they should do.
4223700	4227161	Just give out free games and then I'll pay for download content later on.
4227841	4228482	Like Second Life?
4230102	4231362	No, Second Life is stupid.
4231603	4233363	That's like if I wanted to go pick up Virtual Horde.
4233383	4234083	But the game's free.
4234924	4236124	It is free and you get what you pay for.
4236144	4237304	And you pay for your downloadable content.
4238965	4242966	Yes, but that's a game that... You just described Second Life.
4244127	4246468	Okay, Second Life's a bad example, because that game sucks.
4246689	4248830	And it's not really a game, it's just an addiction.
4248850	4251211	It's like the MySpace of MMOs, okay?
4251551	4256034	But it does specifically do what you were suggesting.
4256474	4258115	Okay, it does, but it sucks at it.
4258896	4268701	So, what I'm trying to say, though, there's other games out there that are also free to play, and most of them are Korean, because apparently they understand how to make a good MMO.
4269222	4271163	Or apparently Malaysian, like one of my friends was on.
4271929	4278331	Go figure, Malaysia, where a lot of piracy used to come out of, and yet they're making good games that are free.
4279231	4279591	I don't know.
4280012	4280592	That's kind of weird.
4282252	4284873	But I digress.
4287454	4298918	There's kind of a little bit of a different topic here, but once again, and we haven't heard about this in a while, Massachusetts now is considering the whole games as porn bill.
4298938	4299658	Really?
4301155	4305036	House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423 House Bill 1423
4330053	4338655	And with the assistance of, or from, of course, well, this right here is why the bill is bad in the first place.
4339375	4343776	Voldemort was the, you know, inspiration on that bill.
4344357	4358740	And, of course, legislative sponsor, Republican Linda, or I'm sorry, Representative Linda Dorcina Forey, who happens to be a Democrat.
4359728	4367635	And, uh, of course, you know, this thing, much like all the other ones in the past, will fail because it's not constitutional.
4367795	4376783	But, at the same time, you know, what do we gotta do to stop these people from wasting our tax dollars on these bills that they know they're gonna fail?
4378264	4384009	You know, it's like the fuckin'... Is it so that when they rerun for office, they can say, like, hey, I took a stand against this...
4385148	4389211	Video games are poisoning your children and I take a stand against this.
4389331	4390832	My name is Rob and I approve this message.
4392333	4392853	Well, great.
4392933	4396596	So it's really for their own personal gain and it's still wasting taxpayers' money.
4396956	4398177	All the more reason you should hate it.
4400539	4400859	I don't know.
4400919	4403461	Do our children really need to be protected from games?
4403961	4407824	I mean, do we really need the government to step in to tell our children what's okay to play?
4407904	4409305	I mean, are we that retarded?
4409905	4413708	I know some people are that retarded, but I would like to think that, you know...
4414525	4415885	Most of us are not that retarded.
4416725	4421066	Because if we're all that retarded, then who the hell are we going to elect in as president?
4422187	4423867	Hey, I promise you shiny things.
4424027	4425487	Okay, you got my vote.
4428208	4428508	I don't know.
4430828	4431268	Alrighty.
4432248	4436509	Well, I'm sure we'll hear about this game later when it fails.
4437349	4440150	Meanwhile, or the bill, not the game.
4440632	4450260	Meanwhile, we're going to get to the end of Part A of our show here, but not before we pay a little respect to our elders in the segment we always do every single week here on the program.
4450340	4454043	It's DarkSakura's Classic Video Game of the Week.
4459408	4461570	So, DarkSakura, you've dug through the archives.
4461610	4464292	You've verified this pic is not a duplicate per the wiki.
4465093	4467775	What classic game should the kids be checking out this week?
4468456	4468816	Jackal.
4470020	4473762	Jackal is a great game because you drive tanks and blow up shit.
4474783	4475663	Best game ever.
4477744	4480086	And yes, I'm talking about the Nintendo version specifically.
4480666	4481787	Listen to the music, it's cool.
4484308	4484768	How is that?
4484788	4485709	I used to play this game.
4488791	4491592	It's like Akari Warriors, but you're in a jeep.
4491612	4495715	Yeah, this is the game, though, that makes me think of that line from Hot Shots.
4496135	4497115	War is fantastic.
4497275	4498216	Fantastic.
4499420	4501281	But no, which I don't really believe.
4501301	4505563	But anyway, I love Jackal just because, okay, I actually have memories of this game.
4506183	4518349	Before my papa, who is my dad's dad, before he died, we would actually sit in front of the big screen TV, and we're talking like, you know, early 90s style big screen, so this is a big deal.
4519210	4520030	Playing the Nintendo.
4520851	4522271	and playing Jackal with Papa.
4522331	4522972	That was great.
4523552	4529254	But, um, the game actually, um, it was, um, an arcade, um, released in Japan.
4529314	4533035	It was called, um, Tokushu Butai, uh, Jakaru, which would be Jackal.
4533815	4536996	Um, Special Forces Unit Jackal, which was released in the U.S.
4537156	4537936	as Top Gunner.
4538937	4543398	Um, basically the whole point of the game is you go through and you can, uh,
4544346	4555154	Run over... Well, I like to run them over, but you can shoot down enemy soldiers wandering around, and you rescue POWs, and you have to actually take them to the extraction point where a helicopter will run off with them.
4556114	4561859	And, um... Then you fight, like, whatever your boss is at the end of the level.
4562959	4569704	But, um... Again, it came out over here in the arcade as Top Gunner, but it did come out as Jackal on the Nintendo.
4570845	4572186	Also, though, for, um...
4573706	4590992	anyone who happened to be one of those few people who has a Famicom Disk System, it was brought out as Final Commando Akai Yosai, which basically is Final Command The Red Fortress.
4592793	4599135	The game's just really fun, and on top of that, when you play two player, it does force you to cooperate because
4601329	4605330	There gets to a point where if one person's going one way, it won't let your other person advance.
4605990	4609971	And sometimes one person can draw fire while the other person goes in and does something else.
4610531	4616573	It's really a cool, I think kind of a unique one for the whole run-and-gun sort of series.
4617993	4623975	You can actually blow up different areas in the game where there's hidden stuff.
4624215	4625675	You can get extra power-ups.
4626256	4627056	You can get...
4629019	4655199	Rocket Launchers I actually preferred to keep the grenades because the grenades would go over a wall whereas rockets just sort of explode on the wall It was really cool I like how you pick up the little dudes I didn't play this game a whole lot I think I remember playing it once and I just wasn't that into it I guess when I was younger but I like how you pick up the little dudes from the houses and then drop them off at the plane and it's like a rescue mission thing It's cool
4655683	4668970	But you can keep upgrading your missiles to where you get your missile launcher, you get one with a higher range, you get one that produces shrapnel, and an area damage missile that shoots out from left and right.
4669970	4671651	I still preferred the grenades because they went over the walls.
4674278	4678281	You can also control which direction you fire in, which was pretty cool.
4678461	4681223	You know, you can turn and fire forward in a different way.
4681463	4682563	I mean, it's like a tank.
4683204	4684565	So, it was really cool.
4684665	4686306	It's one of my favorite ever games.
4687006	4693070	On top of that, I actually have really good memories of the game, so it was kind of cool.
4693731	4703617	And also, there was a bootleg version of Top Gunner that would let you use the Ikari Warriors style controls.
4704246	4704906	That was pretty cool.
4706246	4715508	It had a version on the IBM PC in 1988, like I said, the Famicom Disk System, and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.
4717869	4720829	Or the inevitable Xbox Live Arcade port at some point, probably.
4720849	4721830	Could you imagine this high-res?
4721850	4722750	That would be pretty awesome.
4722850	4723510	Sweet.
4724530	4732172	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Jackal, in this case on the NES, but on a variety of systems, as DarkSakura pointed out.
4732432	4732812	Check it out.
4734713	4737675	Alright, and that's our cue to take a quick break.
4737855	4739536	So that's exactly what we're going to do.
4739576	4745581	We're going to take a break and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.
