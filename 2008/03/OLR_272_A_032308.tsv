7000	14000	There's a host, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loco
14000	19000	Tonight, March 23, 2008, Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live gets a new expansion,
19000	23000	Gibson sues even more businesses over Guitar Hero,
23000	27000	and could Kid Icarus be really making a comeback this year?
27000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	43000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49000	50000	Yo.
50000	52000	How are you, Miss Summers?
52000	54000	I'm full of waffles.
54000	58000	Enjoying the Easter waffles. Isn't this a tradition in your fam?
58000	62000	Well, with our big group of people.
62000	68000	Although it seems that every year there's a new baby added with our friends who join us.
68000	73000	Because one year they have Bob, the next year they have Tatiana is her name.
73000	75000	They call her Tater.
75000	78000	That's a nice name for a child, Tater.
78000	80000	She's cute. She's a cutie.
80000	82000	I don't doubt it. Babies are cute.
82000	96000	And, um, um, we basically just, you know, went to Marie Callender's and got, well, everyone goes, I finally learned my lesson after doing this for eight years.
96000	102000	Is, um, they always go through the omelet line, and I get sick on the omelets every year for some reason.
102000	107000	So I was like, screw your omelets! I'm having eggs Benedict and waffles.
107000	111000	And I had waffles and chocolate eclairs.
111000	113000	Here we go with the whole Food Network thing again.
113000	117000	I swear, our podcast. Video Games Plus Food Equals Yum.
117000	118000	That was great.
118000	120000	That was the alternate name for our podcast, by the way.
120000	121000	No, I'm making that up.
121000	124000	Alright, well, Happy Easter to you, Dark Soccer. I'm glad to hear it.
124000	126000	And the blessed Ostara to you.
126000	127000	Waffly good for you.
127000	130000	And Happy Easter, whatever the heck it is you guys all celebrate.
130000	132000	Well, technically the Spring Equinox is Friday.
132000	133000	If anything. Huh?
133000	135000	The Spring Equinox is Friday.
135000	137000	Alright, then Happy Equinox. Happy whatever.
137000	139000	Happy day. Just happy day.
139000	142000	Happy day, Loki. Tech Master Loki, also here every week.
142000	143000	Hello.
143000	144000	How are you?
144000	145000	I'm okay.
145000	148000	Did you do anything special today? Did the Easter Bunny leave you anything good?
148000	152000	No, I just went over to my mom's house and we barbecued ribs.
152000	154000	Mmm ribs!
154000	156000	You guys have interesting ways of spending Easter.
156000	159000	I mean, interesting good. Not like interesting bad.
159000	161000	But more food.
161000	164000	Or as Frisbee in Chat Room says,
164000	167000	chat.orangelandtrader.com, the always present fourth guest on the show.
167000	171000	Waffle Lounge Foodio.
171000	173000	That could be the name of the show. Waffle Lounge Foodio.
173000	175000	You could play the waffle song from Mystery Science Theater.
175000	177000	No, we're not going to play the waffle song right now.
177000	180000	We're going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week, but first a teaser.
180000	182000	A little teaser.
182000	184000	We have big news to talk about. Like, big.
184000	187000	Like, we just found out 30 minutes ago big.
187000	188000	We'll be talking about that in just a moment.
188000	193000	I know a lot of people in chat are kind of going like WTF because they can hear us on Justin TV talking and like want to know what's up.
193000	195000	And yes, someone died. I killed them.
195000	197000	No, no one died.
197000	200000	The ferret died. Where has he been for the past like year?
200000	204000	Actually, I found the ferret the other day and then I put him back in the dusty corner and I found him and...
204000	207000	Hey, you should have brought the ferret out.
207000	210000	Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
210000	214000	It was uneventful.
214000	216000	Really.
216000	217000	That's it?
217000	218000	It was uneventful.
218000	220000	No DSing? No Ragnarok? No nothing?
220000	221000	Well, I played Ragnarok.
221000	224000	Well, of course. Of course. I mean, that goes without saying.
224000	229000	But I actually did not touch my DS all week. I moved that game.
229000	232000	That game that Dan brought me home that I'm not going to play.
232000	234000	The Professor whatever the fuck it is.
234000	235000	Professor Layton?
235000	236000	Yeah.
236000	239000	You know, I've heard a lot of good things about that game. You might actually want to check it out at some point.
239000	241000	He's hearing. I'm not going to play it.
241000	244000	Well, then give it to me. I'll play it.
244000	246000	Well, you can borrow it.
246000	248000	She doesn't like learning games. She's above that.
248000	250000	Yeah, you don't like learning.
250000	252000	No, I've already learned.
252000	255000	And I found your copy of Every Extend Extra.
255000	256000	Sweet.
256000	257000	Yeah.
257000	258000	Oh, that's where it went.
258000	260000	At my house. It got lost in the vault.
260000	262000	Things disappear at Dark Sakura's house.
262000	265000	That's okay. I found some of Kristen's movies, too.
265000	266000	Alright.
266000	270000	Alright, well, then since your gaming week was uneventful, I'll turn to Loki. How was your gaming week?
270000	272000	I wish I could say I was much better.
272000	274000	I did play a game.
274000	281000	I played Saints Row multiplayer and also the single player stuff because that's why I was playing during lunch.
281000	287000	Now, really this week, though, I was still trying to fix that one 360. I have it now not three-ringed anymore.
287000	296000	So, I just have to see if it stays that way because I don't know if I mentioned this, but I had a third 360 go down on me now.
296000	299000	So, now it's three there, three ringed, and three there not.
299000	301000	So, what percentage of Xbox 360s does that make?
301000	302000	50.
302000	303000	50% of them.
303000	304000	50%.
304000	309000	Luckily, this new one, though, what I did for this one, or I'm planning on doing, is right now it's in one of the clear cases.
309000	316000	So, I'm going to put the old case back on it, and then I bought off of eBay a security label from Microsoft,
316000	319000	you know, one of the ones that they removed on there.
319000	326000	So, I'm going to slap that back on there, and they can fucking replace the thing because I'm not touching it, bastards.
326000	330000	Yeah, and I'm addressing this comment in chat because some people may not know.
330000	333000	Mike W. says, how many 360s does Loki have again?
333000	334000	So, please refresh us.
334000	335000	How many 360s do you have?
335000	336000	I have six.
336000	337000	And why that many?
337000	341000	I had to land them in a game room, and I got them for that.
341000	342000	That's amazing.
342000	344000	That's amazing.
344000	349000	Well, I had five originally, but then I bought one to replace another one, but I ended up fixing the original.
349000	351000	So, we have six.
351000	353000	Wow.
353000	358000	One that hopefully will be fixed here pretty soon because, like I said, it's not three ringed anymore,
358000	363000	but I think it may have overheated so many times that it's damaged, but we'll see.
363000	370000	And then this last one, which I'm sending to Microsoft, so that will be fixed.
370000	373000	So, hopefully it will all be fixed at one point.
373000	381000	But it's not very promising that three out of the six have died within the last, like, three months.
381000	382000	I don't know.
382000	383000	Nice.
383000	385000	So, that's all I really got around to playing this week.
385000	393000	I do have a lot of stuff lined up for this week, including K Project, which is that Res Beta that got released out there.
393000	395000	So, I want to try that because that looks cool.
395000	398000	I've got to dig out my Dreamcast for that.
398000	401000	And then Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core.
401000	404000	Oh, actually I played a little bit of Smash Brothers this week.
404000	406000	Just space emissary stuff.
406000	412000	Oh, and I added everybody in the goddamn friends code list, so stop your bitching.
412000	413000	Okay, seriously.
413000	417000	Nobody was online when I was online earlier, so you know what?
417000	418000	Stop complaining.
418000	421000	Talking about the Orange Lounge Radio forum thread, right?
421000	422000	Of course.
422000	423000	Yeah.
423000	424000	That's what I thought.
424000	425000	Yeah, I added everyone.
425000	428000	No, I didn't add everyone, but I added most people, like...
428000	430000	No, I think I might have added everyone.
430000	434000	So, because I have, like, 40 codes in there, and I've hardly ever played Smash Brothers.
434000	437000	But I'm guessing since Loki's done, I'll go over to my game a week.
437000	439000	I have been playing Smash Brothers a little bit.
439000	444000	I've been working mostly on, like, the single player stuff, not emissary mode for some reason.
444000	450000	Because my friend played, like, 70% through emissary mode, so I didn't even really have to.
450000	454000	I mean, I guess I should go back to his file and beat it or something so I can get some of those characters.
454000	458000	But I've been working mostly on single player and trying to unlock everything in the gallery.
458000	463000	Like, you know, play five brawls with Princess Peach to get Super Mario 2 and, like, things like that.
463000	465000	I've been trying to do as much of that stuff as I can.
465000	468000	So, good times.
468000	470000	And otherwise, I haven't been playing a whole lot.
470000	474000	I went back to the Xbox 360 and just played some random old stuff.
474000	479000	Nothing really of note was playing some World of Warcraft, but I was out of town this weekend.
479000	482000	And I was staying about a block from the Metreon.
482000	484000	Didn't even think to go there.
484000	486000	Just didn't, it's not what it used to be.
486000	490000	You know, if you were there next week, you could actually go to a Crysis core launch party.
490000	491000	That's alright.
491000	494000	Well, actually, I do have to go back to San Francisco next week anyway.
494000	497000	So, maybe I'll check it out.
497000	499000	Well, it's like Tuesday.
499000	501000	Oh, never mind. I'm not going on a weekday.
501000	503000	Hmm, interesting.
503000	505000	Alright.
505000	508000	So, yeah, no new games to review this week.
508000	509000	That's kind of odd.
509000	512000	I've been playing Scrabulous on Facebook.
512000	514000	It's just like Scrabble.
514000	517000	I rented a movie on the Xbox Live movie service thing.
517000	519000	Oh, what'd you rent?
519000	520000	I rented Dark City.
520000	521000	And how was that?
521000	522000	That's a cool movie.
522000	524000	I've seen it before, so it was cool.
524000	525000	Was it in HD?
525000	529000	No, they didn't have an HD version of that, but it's just standard definition.
529000	530000	It wasn't that expensive.
530000	531000	240 points.
531000	534000	And, fuck, it's pretty easy.
534000	535000	You don't have to wait that long.
535000	540000	You just kind of download it and about, I'd say, 30 seconds later, you could start watching it.
540000	543000	Yeah, it just depends on your bandwidth.
543000	545000	If you have dial-up, you might have a problem.
545000	548000	Well, if you have dial-up, I don't think you're going to fucking be downloading a movie.
548000	550000	That would suck.
550000	551000	One gigabyte file?
551000	553000	Yeah, no thanks.
553000	556000	I don't know. It was okay.
556000	559000	I just want to hear something funny, too.
559000	562000	Actually, I have a friend at work right now who's really into rock band,
562000	566000	and he keeps playing all the hard songs for me and then locking me achievements.
566000	567000	Nice.
567000	569000	Because, you know, I can't fucking play the game on hard.
569000	571000	What am I talking about?
571000	573000	I can play guitar. I can't do drums.
573000	575000	Oh, I played rock band this week.
575000	576000	I played a lot of rock band this week, actually.
576000	578000	That's why you take it to parties.
578000	581000	Because of that new, and I don't want to spoil the story of this coming up,
581000	583000	but some of you guys know, rock band had some enhancements this week,
583000	585000	and we'll talk about them a little more a little later on,
585000	588000	but I went to check them out.
588000	591000	I haven't checked the rock band store in a long time,
591000	594000	and I forgot that you can get some Nine Inch Nails songs that are pretty cool,
594000	595000	and I got that.
595000	597000	And then the B-52s have a song on there, so I had to get that,
597000	603000	so I went shopping on rock band because I heart microtransactions.
603000	604000	I've spent way too much money.
604000	606000	Not really, but yeah, I've spent way too much money.
606000	608000	Yeah, way too much on rock band, seriously.
608000	613000	But just think, the next party we have is going to be so bitchin' with rock band.
613000	615000	So we need a rock band party.
615000	618000	The thing though, they don't make it very easy because of that stupid digital rights management.
618000	620000	You know, anything I download, and if I bring it over here,
620000	623000	whatever, I have to be logged in on live in order for all that content to be available.
623000	624000	It sucks.
624000	626000	Yeah, it really blows.
626000	627000	ActDeft is crying in chat.
627000	631000	He says, Mexico still can't access the music store in rock band.
631000	633000	You know what, in some ways it's a good thing,
633000	635000	because then you just start spending money so stupidly,
635000	636000	because you're like, oh, I have points.
636000	637000	I could just spend them.
637000	638000	That's a sad face.
638000	639000	Yeah.
639000	640000	What?
640000	641000	That is a sad face.
641000	642000	That is a sad face.
642000	643000	Very sad face.
643000	645000	So, there you have it.
645000	650000	Okay, so let's get to the big news, and it actually really sucks.
650000	656000	Like, there's really no easy way for us to kind of mention this.
656000	663000	Literally we just heard about some of the changes that have been going on with our streaming provider,
663000	667000	which is Live 365, literally about 30 minutes before our show went live tonight,
667000	674000	and the long and the short of it is that Live 365 is making some obscene changes in their pricing policies,
674000	681000	and they are going to be upping their rates to these obscene amounts.
681000	688000	Basically right now we pay about $60 a month to have about 100 live listeners.
688000	694000	We would have to pay under this new plan $120 a month for 60 live listeners,
694000	697000	which would only barely accommodate what we do on Sundays.
697000	700000	Usually we don't talk about ratings.
700000	703000	We get about 50 to 60 live people on a good Sunday night,
703000	705000	and we've actually gone beyond that before.
705000	707000	I think our highest show had 70 or 80.
707000	708000	I think we've hit higher than 80.
708000	711000	I want to say we have, but I don't know.
711000	714000	It just sucks because it kind of came out of nowhere.
714000	717000	Supposedly, Live 365 sent an email a month ago.
717000	720000	I don't know. I never got it, so whatever.
720000	724000	They're upping these rates, and even if we could afford it, we kind of don't want to.
724000	729000	We've made a decision that we will be leaving Live 365 effective on April 12th.
732000	740000	So that really sucks because that means the feed that we started in May of 2002 is going away.
740000	743000	I wish this was an April Fool's joke chat.
743000	745000	It's not. It's completely legitimate.
745000	748000	This is not an April Fool's joke, like a preemptive strike or something,
748000	750000	because it's not even April yet.
750000	754000	But we have no choice but to leave Live 365.
754000	757000	You'll note I said we are not quitting the show,
757000	763000	so the question is now how do we continue to do Orange Lounge Radio,
763000	770000	but not with Live 365, who we've kind of had for about five and a half years and so on.
770000	774000	And trust me, a lot of the obvious things you guys are talking about in chat,
774000	776000	we're thinking about them too.
776000	778000	So we've sent some emails.
778000	781000	We've kind of put our feelers out there and done some discussion
781000	785000	to see what we can do over the next week,
785000	789000	and we'll hopefully have further information to announce for you guys next week.
789000	793000	And whether that's our own shoutcast, I haven't the foggiest idea.
793000	798000	Again, guys, you have to understand literally we found out about this like 30 minutes to an hour ago,
798000	800000	so we're still trying to kind of scramble to.
800000	805000	But regardless, our live feed will be closing effective April 12th,
805000	809000	meaning that those of you guys that listen at work to the lovely video game music
809000	813000	that plays all day long and the retro lunch and all that, it's going away.
813000	821000	And what I feel most horrible for are the other live folks that we've had
821000	826000	bless our stream with their presence for their hard work in live shows over the years,
826000	831000	including DMN, including Travis Donovan, of course,
831000	834000	including extra for back when he had his show,
834000	837000	including the three of us that do our spinoff shows and we feel like it,
837000	841000	and the things that we had planned that we wanted to do with the live feed
841000	846000	that now all those plans are effectively off, unfortunately.
846000	852000	And obviously we'll do whatever we can for our friends that broadcast as well,
852000	858000	but we have to kind of like our number one priority right now is relocating our Sunday show first,
858000	860000	and then we'll see what we can do after that.
863000	866000	Act Def asked, what's going to happen to DM Insanity and TDL?
866000	868000	I hope they keep going.
868000	870000	I hope they keep going somehow, but unfortunately,
870000	873000	Orange Lounge Radio won't be around for them to do that with.
873000	878000	So Orange Lounge Radio kind of ends in a way on April 12th
878000	881000	because Orange Lounge Radio was the radio station.
881000	884000	This show is actually Orange Lounge Radio Live,
884000	888000	but obviously over the years it's just been like Orange Lounge Radio.
888000	890000	So yeah, I don't know.
890000	894000	The next week is going to be very interesting.
894000	896000	So that's the news.
896000	900000	If you have suggestions or offers, I guess, I don't know,
900000	901000	send us an email.
901000	903000	You can contact me in my personal email box,
903000	906000	rob at orangeloungeradio.com or our general email bag,
906000	908000	mailbagorangeloungeradio.com.
908000	910000	We think we know what we want to do.
910000	912000	We think we know the option that makes the most sense to us,
912000	913000	but it involves other people.
913000	915000	We have to make sure they want to do it too.
915000	918000	So that's that.
918000	920000	You got anything else you guys want to add?
920000	920000	I don't know.
920000	921000	I've kind of been dying.
921000	921000	I don't know.
921000	923000	If you don't like what's going on, you send your emails,
923000	926000	I'd say, to the Live 365.
926000	927000	Professionally, please.
927000	928000	Yeah, professionally.
928000	931000	And then in turn, they hopefully will send emails
931000	934000	to whomever is charging them.
934000	936000	Unfortunately, I think that they probably
936000	938000	know what's going to happen because they're raising
938000	939000	all the rates on their stations.
939000	940000	Obviously, a lot of people are just
940000	944000	going to forego paying those rates and just quit
944000	946000	or find elsewhere, and that's unfortunate.
946000	948000	I imagine we're not the only station that's doing this.
948000	950000	And I'm sure that they didn't have, you know,
950000	952000	it wasn't really their choice to do that,
952000	954000	but that's kind of they have to build.
954000	956000	It does go back to the royalty things you've probably
956000	957000	heard about from the past year.
957000	959000	At least that's what they're blaming it on,
959000	961000	but I still think it was kind of a bit out of left field.
961000	964000	It gives them taking advantage of that situation
964000	965000	for their own personal gain.
965000	967000	I can't help but feel there's a little of that going on.
967000	968000	Anything you want to add, Jamie?
968000	973000	As to somebody who's been a live broadcaster for this long?
973000	974000	Not really.
974000	976000	Not that it hasn't already been said.
976000	977000	So, it sucks.
977000	978000	Wah, wah.
978000	980000	Only to get a fuse.
980000	982000	No.
982000	984000	Ross Steele, UT, says Life 365 is simply
984000	989000	using the RIAA boogeyman as an excuse to screw people.
989000	991000	I don't want to knock them right now,
991000	993000	but let me put it this way.
993000	997000	We have the money to keep going if we wanted to.
997000	999000	We could do the 60 listener limit,
999000	1001000	but we just kind of don't want to.
1001000	1002000	We think we can do better.
1002000	1003000	This is more of an incentive.
1003000	1005000	It kind of shows us that like, hey, Orange Launch Radio,
1005000	1007000	you guys have been kind of lazy the past six years.
1007000	1009000	Just stay on the Life 365, because it was convenient
1009000	1011000	and it was there, and you just touch a button
1011000	1012000	and everything's all set up.
1012000	1014000	So, this is really going to kind of force
1014000	1015000	us to explore alternatives.
1015000	1016000	And it could be exciting.
1016000	1019000	It could be the beginning of big change.
1019000	1020000	Big change.
1020000	1021000	When one door closes, another opens.
1021000	1022000	Absolutely right.
1022000	1024000	I was just going to check that out.
1024000	1026000	This is also another option right here.
1026000	1030000	They have actually people that do hosting for unlimited listeners.
1030000	1031000	We'll see.
1031000	1032000	Maybe.
1032000	1033000	We'll see.
1033000	1034000	Maybe.
1034000	1035000	Maybe.
1035000	1036000	I don't know.
1036000	1037000	So, we'll see over the next week.
1037000	1039000	We're exploring lots and lots of ideas.
1039000	1040000	So that's that.
1040000	1042000	Obviously, our number one priority is keeping this show going.
1042000	1047000	I don't think that many people's worlds will be crushed without a 24-7 music feed.
1047000	1050000	I apologize to those that have been listening to our 24-7 music feed.
1050000	1052000	I know there are some that do,
1052000	1056000	but obviously Sunday show is the priority for us right now.
1056000	1058000	So, we'll see.
1058000	1059000	All right.
1059000	1061000	Too much bad news tonight.
1061000	1062000	Too much bad news.
1062000	1064000	We need to get into some other news.
1064000	1065000	The show will continue.
1065000	1069000	Even if we have to do a non-live show for a couple of weeks, we will.
1069000	1071000	While we relocate, we'll do whatever it takes,
1071000	1075000	but we don't plan on shutting down this show,
1075000	1077000	the Sunday night program as it is.
1077000	1078000	So, that's that.
1078000	1080000	So, we're still here.
1080000	1081000	Na-na-na-na-na.
1081000	1083000	You can't shut us down that easily.
1083000	1084000	All right.
1084000	1085000	Let's get into other housekeeping tonight.
1085000	1087000	The other housekeeping tonight, of course,
1087000	1090000	a happy Easter or whatever it is you celebrate today.
1090000	1092000	If nothing at all, then happy Sunday to you.
1092000	1094000	To all of our Orange Launch Radio listeners,
1094000	1096000	yes, we are here live on Easter
1096000	1098000	because everybody, I guess, did their stuff this morning.
1098000	1099000	I went to the Bay Area this weekend,
1099000	1101000	had a very lovely weekend in San Francisco.
1101000	1102000	It was good.
1102000	1105000	Speaking of San Francisco, this is more of a personal favor.
1105000	1106000	I promised some friends of mine.
1106000	1108000	It's another hobby of mine that I do,
1108000	1110000	and I promised them I would plug this on the show.
1110000	1113000	It's kind of a live appearance for me, so to speak,
1113000	1117000	and it would only work if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area,
1117000	1119000	so I apologize to our listeners who are not.
1119000	1122000	But on Friday, April 25th,
1122000	1125000	in the city of San Francisco at the Clay Theater,
1125000	1128000	which is at Clay and Fillmore in San Francisco,
1128000	1131000	I'm going to be appearing in a live showing of Shock Treatment,
1131000	1135000	which is a movie that is the sequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, sort of.
1135000	1137000	I mean, it's not really the sequel, but...
1137000	1139000	It has the same characters?
1139000	1141000	Kind of. It has Brad and Janet.
1141000	1143000	If you see it, watch it again so that you'll get it.
1143000	1144000	Yeah, exactly.
1144000	1146000	And the thing is that they do Rocky Horror Picture Show,
1146000	1148000	and I've been involved with that for a long time.
1148000	1151000	You know, the show I did before Orange Lawns Radio actually started
1151000	1155000	because of Travis and I's mutual love of Rocky Horror Picture Show
1155000	1157000	under Station Live.
1157000	1161000	I still am involved with that, not as heavily as I used to be,
1161000	1164000	but I still respect the scene and the counterculture that it provides.
1164000	1167000	This is very rare to have this show on the big screen.
1167000	1170000	This is probably the only time this year, outside of a convention,
1170000	1173000	this will show on the big screen, anywhere.
1173000	1175000	So it's Friday, April 25th.
1175000	1177000	I'm going to be in it. I'm in the cast.
1177000	1180000	It's a huge cast. There's like 15 to 20 other people.
1180000	1183000	So check that out. It's at the Clay Theater, April 25th.
1183000	1186000	And a guy that was actually in the movie is going to be there, too,
1186000	1187000	Gary Shale.
1187000	1190000	He was an Oscar drill of Oscar drilling the bits.
1190000	1193000	He's going to be there, and he's performing live at the show.
1193000	1195000	Is he going to play the same character?
1195000	1196000	That'd be funny.
1196000	1198000	About 20 years later, I think so.
1198000	1200000	I don't think he's going to be in the movie,
1200000	1203000	but he's going to do a live performance of probably that song,
1203000	1205000	and I think he's done a musical career since then,
1205000	1207000	so maybe like one or two of his other songs.
1207000	1208000	I want to go.
1208000	1209000	That's pretty cool.
1209000	1210000	You should go. It'll be fun.
1210000	1212000	I'll have to arrange work earlier that day.
1212000	1215000	All right. So it'll be fun. Friday, April 25th.
1215000	1217000	Completely different than video games,
1217000	1219000	but I promised the cast I would give them a shout-out.
1219000	1221000	Shout-out!
1221000	1223000	The Orange Lounge Radio Wiki.
1223000	1225000	Jamie, I showed you that before the show.
1225000	1227000	Isn't that awesome, the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki?
1227000	1230000	I love it that you're missing some jokes.
1230000	1231000	You need to go old school.
1231000	1236000	We have like, you know, cake, death cake.
1236000	1238000	There's lots of old school jokes,
1238000	1241000	but I've got to say I'm very impressed with the work
1241000	1244000	that the folks that have been working on the Wiki have done.
1244000	1247000	Again, the place that the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki is at,
1247000	1251000	orangeloungeradio.wiki, that's W-I-K-I-A dot com,
1251000	1254000	and just to give you an idea of what's there,
1254000	1256000	and this is all the listeners that have been doing this.
1256000	1257000	This is incredible.
1257000	1260000	They have a page of like inside jokes from the show
1260000	1262000	that includes like the locust, tingle, bet,
1262000	1264000	and just some of the other things that have come up on the show,
1264000	1267000	and there's been...
1267000	1270000	They can hear the plane over the live feed right.
1270000	1271000	Can they hear that on the podcast?
1271000	1272000	They're hearing that on Justin TV.
1272000	1275000	Probably Justin TV because the mic's right by the window.
1275000	1276000	Oh yeah, because the window's open.
1276000	1277000	Yeah, they probably can hear the plane outside.
1277000	1280000	Okay, yes, we live by an Air Force base,
1280000	1282000	or it's not actually...
1282000	1283000	It was an Air Force base.
1283000	1284000	Air Force base.
1284000	1285000	It used to be an Air Force base.
1285000	1286000	It used to be an Air Force base.
1286000	1287000	It was a CHP.
1287000	1288000	Oh, somebody's breaking the law.
1288000	1289000	We don't live that far.
1289000	1290000	Sorry.
1290000	1292000	Isn't it now like a business airport is what they use at Fort primarily?
1292000	1293000	Like FedEx?
1293000	1294000	And air shows.
1294000	1295000	Yeah, and air shows.
1295000	1296000	Oh God, the air shows.
1296000	1297000	Oh God.
1297000	1300000	I mean, the Blue Angels kind of get old to me after the first couple times,
1300000	1301000	and they're so loud.
1301000	1304000	I used to go see the Blue Angels when I was a kid, okay?
1304000	1306000	That's how fucking old they are.
1306000	1307000	It's just really...
1307000	1310000	No, we've always lived by the airport,
1310000	1313000	but now it's just tonight the window's open because it's hot here now,
1313000	1315000	so we have the fan on and the window open.
1315000	1317000	Yeah, and I think it's bad now.
1317000	1319000	We only get to like 110 outside.
1319000	1323000	By the way, I found out the information for you on an air conditioner.
1323000	1324000	All right, excellent.
1324000	1326000	We'll talk about that later.
1326000	1329000	That's the reason why we can't afford Live 365.
1329000	1331000	Because we need an air conditioner.
1331000	1332000	We just have, you know.
1332000	1334000	All right, enough about the plane.
1334000	1336000	Okay, where the hell was I?
1336000	1339000	I was talking about the inside jokes, and they've compiled...
1339000	1340000	Okay, get this.
1340000	1343000	There's a list of every single Orange Lounge radio episode,
1343000	1345000	at least the two go in podcast editions,
1345000	1348000	and like Dark Tetsuya or somebody went through,
1348000	1350000	I don't know if this is everybody,
1350000	1353000	they actually listed what happened on every single episode.
1353000	1354000	It's nuts.
1354000	1356000	And then like Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week,
1356000	1358000	an entire archive of the Classic Game of the Week is up there.
1358000	1360000	Which helps me tremendously.
1360000	1362000	Yes, because now she won't repeat anything on accident.
1362000	1364000	Exactly, because I was actually looking at the game I picked today,
1364000	1367000	goes, I've mentioned this so much, should I already do it?
1367000	1371000	So we'll find out what that game is a little later on.
1371000	1374000	And we'll see, it'll be a race to see who can add it to the wiki first,
1374000	1376000	what the game is tonight.
1376000	1379000	So we'll get to that a little later in the show.
1379000	1382000	All right, but let's get to some gaming news.
1382000	1383000	Too much housekeeping and stuff tonight.
1383000	1385000	We need to get into the thick of it with some gaming news.
1385000	1387000	So, Loki, please start us off.
1387000	1390000	So this week, well actually I should say,
1390000	1393000	it hasn't come out yet, but they announced,
1393000	1395000	Sony has announced that a new firmware update
1395000	1400000	will be coming to the PS3 that's going to add Blu-ray Profile 2.0 support,
1400000	1403000	which I think is better known as BD Live.
1403000	1407000	And it will allow you to do different things with your movies,
1407000	1412000	including they'll have additional downloadable interactive content,
1412000	1416000	as well as like interactive games with leaderboards and that kind of stuff.
1416000	1420000	All stuff that you can kind of throw together on a Blu-ray disc,
1420000	1422000	which is pretty cool.
1422000	1425000	Some other cool stuff that they're enhancing,
1425000	1431000	you'll be able to play DivX in Windows Media files larger than two gigabytes.
1431000	1437000	Also the music and photo playlist can be exported from the PS3 to the PSP.
1437000	1441000	DVDs and Blu-rays will resume playback for the moment you last stopped them.
1441000	1447000	The PSP can be used as a remote control to play music on the PS3.
1447000	1451000	And the web browser will feature a faster page loading times
1451000	1455000	with the ability to save links and stream linked videos.
1455000	1457000	That's pretty cool.
1457000	1461000	And also I guess another thing they call mosquito noise reduction
1461000	1465000	will be added to AV control panel for Blu-rays and DVDs.
1465000	1471000	I don't know what the fuck that last part is, but I'm sure someone out there does.
1471000	1473000	I have no idea what that means either.
1473000	1475000	What was that called? Mosquito?
1475000	1476000	Mosquito noise reduction.
1476000	1477000	My guess may be like...
1477000	1480000	Is that to like filter out the planes that fly by while you're watching the movies?
1480000	1484000	I don't know about that. Maybe like line humming or something like that.
1484000	1486000	It removes like the hum off the line.
1486000	1489000	Interesting. Well, I thought Blu-ray was supposed to be like perfect anyway.
1489000	1491000	What the hell is there doing line noise?
1491000	1495000	Your Blu-ray may be perfect, but your theater setup may not be perfect.
1495000	1498000	Ah, I see. Okay. All right.
1498000	1503000	And my God, that sun is so fucking bright through that window.
1503000	1505000	I'm just like blinded by that.
1505000	1509000	I'm sure the Just2TV people that are watching us on there can see,
1509000	1512000	but as we're taping, you know, just the way the sun is.
1512000	1513000	I'm just fine.
1513000	1517000	The sun is shining like right on Loki and I during the entirety of tonight's show.
1517000	1519000	I'm hiding in shadows.
1519000	1521000	Yes, we know Dark Soccer. We know.
1521000	1524000	You know what? Why don't you just like duct tape a towel up there?
1524000	1525000	Nah, it's cool.
1525000	1527000	Loki's just re-situating.
1527000	1532000	See, what will be funny is that then later the sun will move slowly and hit you in the eyes again.
1532000	1533000	Isn't it going that way?
1533000	1536000	Well, like last week it kind of went down after a while.
1536000	1538000	It's shining through the last window right now anyway.
1538000	1541000	Constant exposure to your eyes will eventually give me a headache.
1541000	1542000	Yes.
1542000	1543000	And I'm already starting to get one.
1543000	1545000	Maybe that's why I had a headache earlier. I don't know.
1545000	1546000	Stories.
1546000	1548000	All right. Anyway, sorry.
1548000	1551000	So the PlayStation 3 is not the only thing getting a firmware upgrade,
1551000	1555000	you know, for the whole Blu-ray 2.0 or whatever you want to call it.
1555000	1559000	PSP just got a new firmware. It got the 3.93 firmware.
1559000	1561000	It just rolled out recently.
1561000	1563000	It's not a whole lot of new stuff.
1563000	1568000	It's 20 brand new players in the internet radio feature, and that's really it.
1568000	1571000	Although I imagine it probably closed some loopholes in the hacking world,
1571000	1574000	but my other question would be, has this already been hacked, Loki?
1574000	1578000	No, it hasn't because really all it did was add just those 20 stations,
1578000	1581000	so they have a workaround to add those 20 stations if you want,
1581000	1586000	but otherwise they're not worrying about cracking it because it's basically just that.
1586000	1587000	Oh.
1587000	1590000	It seems a little silly to do a whole firmware upgrade just to add.
1590000	1592000	Those better be 20 damn good stations.
1592000	1595000	20 damn good stations better be in there.
1597000	1598000	We'll see.
1598000	1601000	I don't know, does 3Speech have their own radio station? I'm sure.
1601000	1607000	No, I think all games where we're syndicated on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings,
1607000	1610000	I think they're on there, so that's all you really need, right?
1610000	1614000	We're not on there because Live 365 doesn't go on ShoutKastV,
1614000	1616000	so we've been paying all that money. Why?
1616000	1619000	Well, we can't even get listed on PSPs.
1619000	1621000	Oh, forget it. It's old hat now.
1621000	1623000	Things are going to be changing soon.
1623000	1625000	I have two words for that.
1625000	1630000	Oh, AlphaKantagram says it's not stations, it's players.
1630000	1633000	So I guess I'm what, like different skins and stuff?
1633000	1635000	Well, that's even lamer.
1635000	1636000	Yeah.
1637000	1638000	Tony players.
1638000	1641000	RasteelUT says OLR should be on 3Speech Radio.
1641000	1643000	That would be fun.
1643000	1647000	Then we could talk about all the great things in the Sony world and nothing else.
1647000	1649000	Let's talk about all the good things in the Sony world.
1649000	1651000	And our show would be only five minutes long.
1651000	1654000	Hey, I have some great things in the Sony world to talk about.
1654000	1656000	All right, then please do share.
1656000	1658000	More like Sony being fucking stupid.
1658000	1659000	Ha ha.
1659000	1665000	No, basically EA put out a patch for the Orange Box on PS3
1665000	1671000	that's supposed to address these problems with connectivity and frame rate issues
1671000	1675000	and slow loading times, but they haven't put out any other documentation
1675000	1677000	to really say what else it's supposed to do.
1677000	1680000	And the thing is like 128 meg.
1680000	1682000	So it's kind of big.
1682000	1685000	And no one else really knows what else it does.
1685000	1688000	And the whole thing is it's not really Valve that did it.
1688000	1691000	It's from their third party, so whatever.
1693000	1699000	Well, at least it's not like, I was going to say like Bully got patched recently
1699000	1701000	and apparently the patch didn't do anything.
1701000	1705000	See, Valve, this is what you get for having software on PlayStation 3.
1705000	1708000	I don't know, RustyOUT in chat says the patch does nothing.
1709000	1711000	Well, he said what the patch did.
1711000	1713000	It's just, I don't know.
1713000	1714000	It's supposed to do.
1714000	1718000	Well, I am looking that up right now because I don't remember off the top of my head
1718000	1721000	because I don't own the PS3 version of the Orange Box.
1721000	1726000	And you know me, I don't care about anybody but myself, so I don't know.
1726000	1728000	I don't have the PS3 version either.
1728000	1729000	I have the Xbox 360 version.
1729000	1735000	And keep in mind, the only version worth having is either PC or Xbox 360.
1735000	1739000	PlayStation 3 is, it's not meant to be online.
1740000	1744000	Well, I mean, let's not get mad at them.
1744000	1745000	I mean, who cares?
1745000	1749000	Okay, the PS3 version, they maybe didn't program it just quite right.
1749000	1752000	Well, we actually had a discussion on that earlier today
1752000	1754000	about which version of Bionic Commando we were going to get.
1754000	1759000	And Dan was pretty much saying that even though it's going to be scaled back for resolution,
1759000	1764000	we're talking about getting the Xbox 360 version because there will be more people online to play with.
1764000	1765000	I guess that's true.
1766000	1768000	And I don't know if they're going to actually scale it back resolution-wise.
1768000	1777000	I mean, after all, they did allow them to break the barrier for Street Fighter 2 HD Turbo Remix,
1777000	1779000	whatever the fuck it's called now.
1779000	1783000	I think that that was the last announced thing, though, that they were having to scale it back
1783000	1786000	because the game wasn't quite working at the full resolution.
1787000	1793000	I'm sure Microsoft will let them bend the rules a little bit to make it work with a big game like that.
1794000	1795000	Okay.
1795000	1799000	Anyways, since we've wasted enough time, now I can tell you what was in that patch.
1799000	1804000	They fixed graphical issues where a player would have the explosion effect
1804000	1808000	left on the end of their rocket launcher while attempting to rocket jump.
1808000	1815000	Some memory leaks fixed an issue where the player's name would not appear on the stats comparison screen.
1815000	1822000	There's an issue that would cause the vote tallies to disappear when you viewed a scoreboard between rounds.
1822000	1824000	Online server issue.
1825000	1826000	Let's see here.
1826000	1832000	An issue with players not always being added to the player's menu and across media bar.
1832000	1837000	Fixed a bug where a player viewing a friend without an EA account
1837000	1840000	would have an empty entry in their friend's leaderboard.
1840000	1846000	Fixed an issue where it was not possible to connect to EA servers if you have more than 30 friends.
1846000	1852000	Sounds like they fixed a lot of issues, but nothing really important like frame rate issues
1852000	1855000	or anything that really needed to be fixed.
1857000	1858000	Huh, unfortunate.
1858000	1860000	Speaking of Valve, you know what I checked out?
1860000	1864000	Finally, after all this time, and I know some of you guys are going to be like,
1864000	1865000	Oh my God, Rob, you're behind the times.
1865000	1870000	I finally downloaded and checked out Steam this week after all this time.
1870000	1872000	It's a nice little front-end program.
1872000	1876000	It kind of reminds me of X-Fire, but with game purchases available inside it.
1876000	1881000	And I actually thought about getting Portal just so I can have it on the computer
1881000	1885000	because I'm a sucker for that game as a lot of people are, what can I say?
1885000	1889000	So other cool stuff that's happening this week.
1889000	1895000	I believe Famitsu Magazine, I want to say they were leaked out.
1895000	1900000	I wouldn't really say leaked out, but they had Persona 4 covered in there.
1900000	1905000	I guess it was their exclusive with a bonus DVD with a bunch of screenshots and movies
1905000	1908000	and all sorts of stuff from the new game.
1908000	1912000	Apparently, Persona 4 is coming to Japan in July.
1912000	1918000	Interesting enough, it's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 and not the PS3.
1918000	1920000	So that's pretty cool.
1920000	1925000	And it looks, to me, I think it looks a hundred times better than Persona 3.
1925000	1929000	So I'm sure a lot of people will be very happy about that.
1929000	1931000	No word of what's coming over to the U.S.,
1931000	1935000	but seeing as they've brought over Persona 3 and Persona 3 FES,
1935000	1938000	it makes perfect sense that they would actually bring it over.
1938000	1943000	Absolutely, and with Persona 3 getting the cult-ish style acclaim that it has over here,
1943000	1947000	I mean, Persona 3, definitely those that have played it have really enjoyed the game,
1947000	1952000	and I keep getting people telling me that I should play that game lots.
1952000	1955000	I'm just surprised though, because the screenshots I saw, or at least the pictures,
1955000	1959000	I think a lot of that was from the full motion video in there, which is all anime.
1959000	1963000	But it looked to me almost like a PlayStation 3 game,
1963000	1967000	but I guess it's PlayStation 2, which is, hey, awesome.
1967000	1972000	That is pretty interesting that they're packing all that in a PlayStation 2 game,
1972000	1973000	you know what I mean?
1973000	1978000	That they're still cranking them out for the quote-unquote old system,
1978000	1981000	but, you know, I guess still tons and tons of PS2s out there,
1981000	1985000	it's still one of the better selling game systems, eh?
1985000	1986000	Yeah.
1986000	1987000	Why not?
1987000	1989000	I guess it makes sense.
1989000	1991000	Well, another game that folks are looking forward to,
1991000	1995000	not just on the PlayStation 3, but on the Xbox 360, is Street Fighter IV,
1995000	1999000	and it seems like little bits and pieces of Street Fighter IV news
1999000	2003000	come out every week to keep this game on the blog radar and on places like our show,
2003000	2006000	and it works brilliantly, because, you know,
2006000	2009000	there's some interesting news this week that has been announced,
2009000	2013000	and that is that it has some more in common with Street Fighter II.
2013000	2017000	This game is starting to sound more and more like just another like Street Fighter II port,
2017000	2020000	but just like completely new graphics and everything.
2020000	2024000	Really? Just like Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.
2024000	2029000	Well, but yet, you know, it's got the whole, it's 3D-ish element,
2029000	2031000	and, you know, the whole new characters and all that,
2031000	2039000	so, you know, the fighter guy and the, what was her name, Crimson Viper, whatever her name was,
2039000	2042000	so there's some, I think it'll be very cool,
2042000	2047000	but the news that was announced this week is that not only are there some small,
2047000	2049000	you know, cosmetic changes in the game and da-da-da,
2049000	2055000	but that the old combos will work exactly the same way in the new game,
2055000	2058000	and that means the old combos from Street Fighter II.
2058000	2064000	So, and if you use, like, if you got, you know, a Guile combo down that you used to use in Street Fighter II,
2064000	2067000	apparently you can use them in Street Fighter IV as well.
2067000	2070000	Interesting.
2070000	2074000	Obviously, I'm assuming it doesn't end there, and you can, there's all sorts of new combos and things as well,
2074000	2081000	but kind of interesting that those folks that were, you know, experts at Street Fighter II will be a leg up already on Street Fighter IV.
2081000	2084000	Awesome. All the more reason for me not to play this game. Why?
2084000	2087000	It was in the arcade.
2087000	2091000	Makes me long for, uh, Co-Co-Co-Combo Breaker.
2091000	2085280	Dude, I love Killer
2095000	2101000	But that's just, have you ever played against, though, one of those people who are just, like, the combo people?
2101000	2102000	It's painful.
2102000	2108000	You know, strangely enough, not so much in Street Fighter II, but in Mortal Kombat, I used to get those people all the time, and it used to piss me off.
2108000	2114000	I was one of those people on the beta version, though, just because I learned the Kitana's Infinite combo.
2114000	2118000	Which was funny, because people get mad. Anyway, speaking of pain...
2118000	2123000	I gotta say this real quick in chat, Rob D. says, uh, there's no way they could get away with skipping those combos.
2123000	2126000	This is nothing new. They never change mechanics that much.
2126000	2130000	True, but when you consider the age of Street Fighter II, you know what I mean?
2130000	2132000	It's kinda, kinda cool.
2132000	2133000	Can I get on with the pain?
2133000	2135000	You may. Bring on the pain.
2135000	2145000	Well, pain is gonna be on Playstation Network, at least for the PAL PSN, for 4.99 pounds.
2145000	2150000	Basically, it's a game where you throw stuff for points.
2150000	2153000	I can't really describe it much else than that.
2153000	2154000	Didn't you buy pain?
2154000	2155000	No.
2155000	2156000	I thought you did.
2156000	2162000	I have not bought anything. Well, other than Flow, I bought that on there.
2162000	2168000	But other than that, I have not bought a game on the PSN, because I do not like their payment method.
2168000	2170000	It's like jackass in the game.
2170000	2172000	I don't like using real money. I like points.
2172000	2173000	Sorry, Jamie.
2173000	2183000	Basically, the whole point of pain is that, you know, you're causing misfortune in people, and people grow up and laugh at them.
2183000	2188000	They get laughed at, so basically that's sort of what pain is about.
2188000	2198000	Anyway, to get back to the story, there are also additional packs that are 69 pence each,
2198000	2208000	and it will be the Scurvedog, Muffy, Santa, Hunglo, Ginger, Cookie, and Fun with Explosives packs.
2208000	2210000	The last one is supposed to be a freebie.
2210000	2216000	You know, but any game that combines Santa and Fun with Explosives, you think would be Instant Win, so I don't know.
2216000	2218000	If I had a band, it would be named Fun with Explosives.
2218000	2223000	Really?
2223000	2230000	But also, the store also has the Shranglehold pack for $9.99.
2230000	2232000	That's, again, in pounds.
2232000	2235000	That has multiplayer maps.
2235000	2238000	It actually should be the one that they got on Xbox Live.
2238000	2241000	You should see if that name is taken in Rock Band.
2241000	2243000	Fun with Explosives.
2243000	2249000	Well, if not, then I would be stealing the one from clerks that Dan came up with this morning.
2249000	2250000	What's that?
2250000	2252000	Making Fuck.
2252000	2254000	It's probably taken.
2254000	2255000	I wouldn't doubt it.
2255000	2260000	I think I have the name Emergency Kittens, but there's no one in the band, so whatever.
2260000	2268000	Anyhow, let's move on to some release dates for other things coming out around the world in the regular stores, the big box stores.
2268000	2269000	Yes.
2269000	2272000	This week, we've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.
2272000	2278000	Of course, winding down a little bit until we get to Mario Kart and Grand Theft Auto.
2278000	2285000	But in the US, we've got Dark Sector coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2285000	2293000	Also this week, Viking Battle for Asgard, that's also coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2293000	2299000	Just a little game here on the PSP, Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core.
2299000	2301000	That'll be coming out as well this week.
2301000	2307000	Probably one of the biggest releases on the PSP for a while at least.
2307000	2318000	Also this week, we've got Opuna on the Wii, that's that Koei RPG that you can actually control the entire game with the nunchuck only.
2318000	2321000	I'm actually very curious to check out Opuna.
2321000	2323000	I definitely want to check out that game.
2323000	2332000	There's a little budget puzzle game called Octomania, $19.99 for this game, and you can play it online with other people.
2332000	2334000	So that's not bad at all.
2334000	2339000	Also this week, Naruto the Ultimate Ninja 3 on PlayStation 2.
2339000	2344000	Obscure the Aftermath on PlayStation 2 and the Wii.
2344000	2351000	Let's see here, a really crappy game called Backyard Baseball 2009 for the DS.
2351000	2365000	I don't know what number release this is this year, but one of the billion releases for Harvest Moon this year with Harvest Moon DS Cute.
2365000	2367000	That's going to be coming out on the DS.
2367000	2370000	Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword also on the DS.
2370000	2372000	That'll be fun too.
2372000	2376000	Does Ninja Gaiden still have the epic cinema scenes like the old school games have?
2376000	2377000	I'm not sure.
2377000	2379000	God, I hope so on the DS.
2379000	2385000	But the whole game is controlled with the stylus, so that's pretty cool.
2385000	2393000	And let's see here, we've also got some more crap here.
2393000	2397000	I guess, oh, this is also coming out on the 31st.
2397000	2404000	Monokhemia Alchemist of Alrivis, and that is a new RPG by Koei as well.
2404000	2408000	And that's pretty much it.
2408000	2409000	Yeah, for right now.
2409000	2415000	And I know next week there's absolutely shit coming out, so enjoy it while you laugh.
2415000	2420000	Alrighty, well let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases that will be coming out in Japan very soon.
2420000	2431000	On the Xbox 360, you get Dark Sector comes out, as well as Raiden Fighters Aces and Tomb Raider Anniversary all come out in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.
2431000	2438000	Also, a DVD lens cleaner, if you needed one of those for your Xbox 360.
2438000	2443000	On the PlayStation 3, also a DVD lens cleaner.
2443000	2444000	Imagine that.
2444000	2446000	Hori's cranking out the DVD cleaning.
2446000	2451000	I guess folks are getting their PlayStations and Xboxes dirty over there.
2451000	2458000	Also, Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga, and after all this time, Japan, I know you've really been waiting for this on PlayStation 3,
2458000	2468000	The Golden Compass finally gets its port on the PlayStation 3 over in Japan, or as they call it, Lira Nobuken.
2468000	2470000	That's the name of it.
2470000	2475000	Coming out on other systems on the Nintendo Wii, Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga also on the Nintendo Wii.
2475000	2479000	Ninja Reflex Nitro Bike makes its way out of there.
2479000	2482000	Here's a spoiler for Japan, Nitro Bike sucks.
2482000	2484000	And how do you know that?
2484000	2487000	Because I played it, and it sucks.
2487000	2488000	What sucks about it?
2488000	2490000	You can't say a game sucks without telling us what sucks about it.
2490000	2496000	The game sucks, the graphics are horrible, the polygons and textures are low-res, the game controls like crap,
2496000	2500000	and it's trying to be Excite Truck, except it's nowhere near Excite Truck.
2500000	2504000	I got it for Nelly because I thought, hey, this looks like an Excite Truck.
2504000	2508000	It's got rockets and everything, and it's created by the people at the Excite Bike 64.
2508000	2510000	What could be bad about it?
2510000	2514000	Well, apparently a lot, so that's why it sucks.
2514000	2519000	GS68, by the way, refers to one of the earlier titles we mentioned in the chat.
2519000	2523000	He says, Golden Cump Ass, get it?
2523000	2525000	Golden Cump Ass.
2525000	2532000	PlayStation 2 sees Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus comes out,
2532000	2539000	as well as Neo Angelique Full Voice in a premium box and a super premium box,
2539000	2541000	as well as the original comes out.
2541000	2545000	Silent Hill Origins makes its way to some Asian regions this week,
2545000	2549000	but Korea's the only one we see mentioned, so be sure to check.
2549000	2552000	It might be a little bit longer before it makes its way to Japan.
2552000	2558000	Nobunaga no Yabu Online comes out in Japan this week as well.
2558000	2560000	Lots of fun stuff.
2560000	2563000	Let's see real quickly what's coming out on the handheld systems.
2563000	2569000	On the Nintendo DS, we have Business Ryokukente DS comes out.
2569000	2579000	Katakushi Hitman Reborn, Bongoshiki Taisen Battle Sugoruku comes out.
2579000	2580000	Baseball game.
2580000	2583000	I like that it says Hitman Reborn in it in the middle of it, though.
2583000	2588000	Kind of makes me think of a different type of game.
2588000	2590000	Maybe it's baseball with Hitman. That would be fun.
2590000	2591000	No.
2591000	2594000	They need Battlefield Baseball. That would be pretty awesome.
2594000	2598000	Let's see, Simple DS series gets volume 35, the Genshin this week.
2598000	2604000	Lost in Blue 2 gets a price reduction, and Mobile Suit Gundam 00 comes out.
2604000	2611000	Mina de Flash Anzen DS, Mina no Atsumare Quiz Party comes out,
2611000	2615000	and wait for it, the Golden Compass on Nintendo DS.
2615000	2619000	PSP, check in real quick to see if anything's coming out of note there.
2619000	2623000	Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G, that might be kind of cool,
2623000	2627000	as well as Tomb Raider Anniversary comes out on the Sony PSP.
2627000	2629000	That's it for Japan.
2629000	2631000	That's all.
2631000	2636000	Okay, well, I have for our UK listeners another set of release dates.
2636000	2640000	We have on the 27th, the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.
2640000	2643000	You've heard us talk about this, so don't worry about it.
2643000	2646000	The Golden Horde on PC.
2646000	2651000	On the 28th, we have Coded Arms Contagion, Football Manager 2008,
2651000	2655000	God of War Chains of Olympus, King of Clubs,
2655000	2659000	Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution,
2659000	2664000	Powershot Pinball Constructor, which sounds pretty fun, that's on DS,
2664000	2669000	Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on Wii, Sega Bass Fishing,
2669000	2673000	Universe at War Earth Assault, Viking Battle for Asgard,
2673000	2678000	Warriors of the Lost Empire, Warriors Orochi on PC and PSP,
2678000	2683000	and Worms Space Oddity.
2683000	2686000	That would be it.
2686000	2689000	Coming out here not very soon, but soon enough,
2689000	2693000	in June, Activision actually announced that they will be bringing
2693000	2696000	Guitar Hero on tour to the Nintendo DS.
2696000	2699000	Now, you may be wondering, how the hell are they going to do that?
2699000	2702000	Well, there's actually a brand new peripheral that they're releasing along with it,
2702000	2704000	called the Guitar Grip.
2704000	2709000	It has four fret buttons and a wonderful little hand strap to put your hand through.
2709000	2714000	So, you use that just like you would, you know, the fret buttons on an actual guitar,
2714000	2717000	and then you strum on the touchscreen with a stylus,
2717000	2722000	or actually a pick stylus that comes with the game to do that kind of stuff.
2722000	2725000	And, of course, you know, plays just like Guitar Hero.
2725000	2729000	It's supposed to have 20 songs, or more than 20 songs in the game,
2729000	2733000	and 80% of the songs will be original master recordings.
2733000	2735000	So, that's pretty cool.
2735000	2740000	If my memory serves me right, it's $49.99, comes out June 22nd.
2740000	2743000	Oh, just in time for my birthday!
2743000	2746000	By the way, they've wasted no time in whoring this game to the masses.
2746000	2750000	I don't know if you guys ever visit yahoo.com, like just, you know, out of the blue,
2750000	2754000	but it's one of the pages I'll go to, you know, for, like, news and search and stuff.
2754000	2757000	And there's a little flash ad that pops right up there.
2757000	2759000	It's already whoring the Guitar Hero on tour.
2759000	2760000	Oh, yeah.
2760000	2761000	They're wasting no time.
2761000	2764000	And I would recommend pre-ordering this if you're really interested in it,
2764000	2767000	because, like most other Activision games that include peripherals,
2767000	2771000	especially brand new peripherals that they're breaking ground on,
2771000	2773000	this thing will be hard to find.
2773000	2777000	Frisbee asks, is anyone honestly going to buy this crap?
2777000	2779000	I actually have mine pre-ordered already.
2779000	2780000	I'm considering it.
2780000	2783000	But I'm not going to probably play it, because that's what I do.
2783000	2786000	It looks interesting.
2786000	2788000	I'm interested enough where I at least want to play it.
2788000	2790000	I don't know if I want to drop, what, you said $49.95?
2790000	2791000	$49.99.
2791000	2794000	I don't know if I want to drop $50 on it, especially if it's only 20 songs.
2794000	2798000	But I'm interested in, like, checking it out.
2798000	2799000	I don't know. I think it's neat.
2799000	2802000	I don't think it would be that difficult if it's only four buttons
2802000	2804000	if I can already play five button mode on the, uh...
2804000	2805000	Dude, Konami really missed out, man.
2805000	2807000	They could have done Guitar Freeze with three buttons.
2807000	2810000	Mm, I've been saying that for a long time. Just saying.
2810000	2811000	All right.
2811000	2813000	Well, I'm interested. Actually, I'm interested.
2813000	2814000	Let me ask chat.
2814000	2818000	How many folks in chat are interested in picking this game up,
2818000	2819000	Guitar Hero on tour?
2819000	2820000	Quick, quick poll of chat,
2820000	2823000	because I imagine most of you that own DSes or, you know,
2823000	2825000	or if you don't own a DS, imagine you did.
2825000	2828000	Would you pick up this game?
2828000	2831000	And Frisbee says, please just smack yourself.
2831000	2832000	Elite Beat Agents.
2832000	2834000	Okay, thanks.
2834000	2836000	Oh, I feel so sorry for Elite Beat Agents.
2836000	2839000	I was in Fry's the other day, and that game's, like, on clearance.
2839000	2840000	Yeah.
2840000	2841000	Tons and tons of copies.
2841000	2842000	You can't buy it anymore, actually. It's kind of sad.
2842000	2845000	So sad. That game is awesome.
2845000	2848000	But, you know, hey, and here's the thing,
2848000	2851000	and I don't know if you should start getting worried about this or not,
2851000	2854000	but they're really whoring Guitar Hero out.
2854000	2858000	I mean, Activision, I don't know if they're going to drive it into the ground or what,
2858000	2862000	but, I mean, we've got, actually, literally a week after this,
2862000	2865000	Guitar Hero Aerosmith coming out.
2865000	2867000	Then you've got Guitar Hero 4,
2867000	2870000	and who knows how many other shit, you know,
2870000	2873000	games that they're going to throw in the middle there.
2873000	2875000	They're really whoring that franchise out,
2875000	2877000	and, I mean, and people are kind of really buying into it, unfortunately.
2877000	2880000	Alright, let's look at our instant poll results in Chat Room.
2880000	2882000	I'm not going to read the nickname since that'll take me too long,
2882000	2883000	but really quickly, here's some of the comments.
2883000	2887000	Question was, are you going to buy Guitar Hero on Tour DS?
2887000	2892000	I'm not. Zero percent. No. No. Not me.
2892000	2895000	Just get a PSP and DJ Max.
2895000	2898000	Depends on the song list. Maybe.
2898000	2902000	Only for the peripheral to make it easier to play Puzzle League.
2902000	2904000	Strap for the win.
2904000	2909000	If the game has songs I like, I might download, I mean, pick it up.
2909000	2915000	I may get it if they guarantee cheap expansion pack song cards minus peripheral.
2915000	2919000	Never ever ever ever.
2919000	2923000	I will purchase Guitar Hero on Tour after I'm done burning $100 bills.
2923000	2926000	No. Nope. You'd look like a damn fool playing it.
2926000	2928000	No. No. Not ripped off.
2928000	2932000	And, Con.
2932000	2934000	There's your instant poll results.
2934000	2938000	Well, I was just thinking, I mean, this is a good game for kids,
2938000	2940000	especially when you're taking them on the road and stuff.
2940000	2943000	They can play their Guitar Hero with headphones on in the car
2943000	2946000	and not bug Mommy and Daddy while they're driving to Grandma's house.
2946000	2951000	Yeah, I think, again, the soccer moms are going to make or break this game.
2951000	2953000	Really, I think is what it's going to be.
2953000	2955000	I think you're absolutely right.
2955000	2958000	It's a great game to just give to your kids.
2958000	2960000	Give your kids some headphones in the game,
2960000	2963000	and look, you can play Guitar Hero in the car. Have fun.
2963000	2964000	Shut up.
2964000	2966000	Really, the only reason I'm buying it is so we can show it on the show.
2966000	2968000	That's pretty much the only reason.
2968000	2969000	Oh, don't waste your money.
2969000	2973000	Well, hey, just because I ordered it doesn't mean I'm going to actually buy it, okay?
2973000	2975000	Because I don't have to.
2975000	2980000	I just put it on order to kind of hold my spot.
2980000	2982000	RosteelUT says,
2982000	2988000	Loki, you're high. They'll bug Mommy even more with this game by singing along.
2988000	2993000	No, maybe my wife would do that, but, you know.
2993000	2996000	Just don't put songs with words in them. There you go.
2996000	2997000	All right.
2997000	2998000	It's your mental only.
2998000	3002000	Let's go into more lawsuit news from Gibson.
3002000	3004000	We already kind of talked about this last week,
3004000	3008000	but if you can believe it, even more lawsuits coming out from Gibson.
3008000	3011000	You remember Gibson sued Activision.
3011000	3014000	They sued Harmonix last week, all over the fact that Gibson says
3014000	3019000	they have had a patent for electronic guitars for quite some time.
3019000	3026000	And get this, this week, now they've sued GameStop, Walmart, Target, Kmart, Amazon, Toys R Us,
3026000	3029000	all these major retailers that sell Guitar Hero games,
3029000	3032000	seeking basically to stop the sale of the games.
3032000	3038000	Did you see they also sued EA, even though EA doesn't make Guitar Hero at all?
3038000	3040000	It's crazy, yeah.
3040000	3048000	I was going to say, in the next piece here, they sued Harmonix, Viacom, and EA now as well.
3048000	3053000	Just because, I guess, they want to sue as many people as possible.
3053000	3055000	I don't understand this. This makes no sense at all.
3055000	3058000	I don't know. They're looking for money.
3058000	3062000	But why would you sue the retailers to get them to try to stop selling the game?
3062000	3065000	Because they're trying to make a big stink.
3065000	3070000	They're trying to make a big stink and seeing who will give them money.
3070000	3073000	Loki says the EA suit is over Rock Band.
3073000	3078000	I don't know if it's over Rock Band, because they mention Guitar Hero in the lawsuit.
3078000	3081000	It's not Rock Band.
3081000	3083000	Is it because now Harmonix is a part of...
3083000	3085000	Oh no, I guess it was just an agreement. I don't know.
3085000	3088000	That just sucks. Let's sue everything.
3088000	3090000	I like that comment from Gerardimo in chat.
3090000	3094000	Well, you've got to wonder, is this Gibson thing legitimate or not?
3094000	3096000	There's actually an analyst out there.
3096000	3098000	Of course, we love analysts.
3098000	3103000	This is actually a legal analyst working for Wedbush Morgan.
3103000	3105000	He's an analyst.
3105000	3108000	He says this about the lawsuits.
3108000	3110000	Michael Pastors' name.
3110000	3113000	This is a poorly masked attempt to extort money.
3113000	3117000	They are using any way they can to have Activision write them a check.
3117000	3120000	Seriously, this is the third game.
3120000	3125000	Well, the third major release of the game that's been out so far.
3125000	3129000	I think at one time they had Gibson guitars in the game, I want to say.
3129000	3131000	I don't know. I may be wrong.
3131000	3135000	How could they not be aware that they're violating the patent?
3135000	3138000	I mean, oh, wait a second.
3138000	3141000	This is a guitar game? How retarded are they?
3141000	3145000	I would say the fact that the Gibson guitars were in the game should negate the whole damn thing,
3145000	3148000	because they've known this that long, and they made that agreement.
3148000	3150000	Now they're absolutely after burning themselves.
3150000	3152000	And if we want to really draw straws,
3152000	3156000	they weren't the first ones to come up with the whole guitar game thing anyways.
3156000	3159000	It was Konami, and if I remember correctly,
3159000	3164000	I thought Activision was licensing the rights to use that from Konami,
3164000	3167000	and not Gibson.
3167000	3169000	They're just...
3169000	3172000	All I gotta say is the next fucking guitar games you guys put out,
3172000	3174000	just forget about Gibson.
3174000	3178000	There's plenty of other guitar manufacturers out there you can license guitars for.
3183000	3188000	Well, anyhow, this news I know makes me angsty every time I hear about this,
3188000	3190000	and I'm sure you guys feel the same way.
3190000	3194000	So you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.
3194000	3210000	...
3210000	3213000	Well, I guess Fly 365 goes without saying,
3213000	3218000	so I'm not gonna really go too much in depth on that.
3218000	3225000	But FU2 having way too many people in the house
3225000	3227000	when I had a doffy to work on,
3227000	3229000	I suddenly got her blushed,
3229000	3232000	and I haven't finished with the rest of the face.
3234000	3240000	FU2 basically being kind of middle income,
3240000	3245000	because we make too much money to be able to afford some of these low-income,
3245000	3248000	first-time buyer loan programs,
3248000	3252000	but we don't make enough to really afford a decent house.
3252000	3255000	So people who actually make less than us can afford a nicer house.
3255000	3257000	I don't know. That fucking sucks.
3259000	3262000	FU2 Live 365 goes without saying.
3262000	3267000	In fact, I think when this show comes back in a non-Live 365 place,
3267000	3272000	we should actually probably rename this segment to the Live 365 Memorial FUs of the Week.
3272000	3274000	That might be fun.
3274000	3278000	Also, I want to give an FU2 the CAT scan I had on Thursday.
3278000	3279000	It was so miserable.
3279000	3283000	Look, I still have a bruise from where they gave me the little shot thingy,
3283000	3285000	or the iodine thing.
3285000	3287000	I was so miserable.
3287000	3289000	I reacted so bad to it.
3289000	3291000	Yeah, I had to have a CAT scan,
3291000	3293000	because I'm still having those pains that I've been having,
3293000	3295000	and they're not going away, which sucks.
3295000	3297000	And I don't get the results back till Monday,
3297000	3299000	so FU2 waiting.
3299000	3300000	That sucks.
3300000	3302000	It does suck.
3302000	3304000	I'll tell you what, though.
3304000	3306000	This is the best diet I've ever been on.
3306000	3308000	I'll eat a couple things, and I get extremely full.
3308000	3310000	It's like I had gastric bypass or something,
3310000	3312000	without having to pay for it.
3312000	3313000	It's great.
3313000	3315000	All right, that does it for the FUs of the Week.
3315000	3317000	Let's get back to some gaming news.
3317000	3323000	Wow, we have almost a whole segment of music game news, don't we, Jamie?
3323000	3325000	Yeah, how's that?
3325000	3328000	Right before they're screwing us over.
3328000	3337000	Anyway, MTV has said that they've sold more than 6 million, I think,
3337000	3340000	songs in Rock Band as downloadable content.
3340000	3344000	So now Harmonics is bringing in the Rock Band music store
3344000	3347000	for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,
3347000	3355000	so that you can actually download your songs in-game without leaving the game.
3355000	3364000	And so you can sort them by artist, genre, album, title, pack, and other ways, too.
3364000	3366000	There's album art.
3366000	3371000	You can listen to song previews and difficulty levels.
3371000	3375000	And the patch is actually supposed to be out this week.
3375000	3377000	Or maybe it's already out.
3377000	3379000	Yeah, the patch is already out.
3379000	3382000	Didn't you say that you...
3382000	3383000	I did, and it's lots of fun.
3383000	3385000	Sorry, I just... he's eating toast.
3385000	3386000	I know.
3386000	3392000	I give that F.U. to not being able to eat, and then I'm eating.
3392000	3393000	Excuse me, sorry.
3393000	3395000	So yeah, I did download the music store,
3395000	3397000	and it's actually kind of cool because you get the little album art,
3397000	3399000	and then you can download the song previews now.
3399000	3402000	So if you're not sure exactly what a song is,
3402000	3404000	I think I've heard that song, but I'm not sure.
3404000	3407000	You can download the little song previews, and it stays on there.
3407000	3409000	So when you're scrolling in the list in the future, you can kind of hear it,
3409000	3412000	like it was DDR or something.
3412000	3415000	Especially the music store kind of looks like a DDR selection screen to me.
3415000	3416000	I don't know.
3416000	3419000	I like the fact that you can actually preview the songs,
3419000	3421000	something that I thought should have been on there in the first place
3421000	3424000	instead of having to buy these songs blindly
3424000	3427000	unless you have a YouTube link where you can watch the video
3427000	3429000	or listen to the song.
3429000	3431000	I think that's smart.
3431000	3434000	I think the whole thing was smart because I realized there were songs in there
3434000	3437000	I wanted that I didn't realize I didn't have.
3437000	3439000	Yeah, because it's hard sometimes,
3439000	3442000	especially when you recognize a song on the radio by the song,
3442000	3444000	not necessarily by the title,
3444000	3446000	or you might not even know who the artist is.
3446000	3447000	You just recognize the song.
3447000	3449000	Press Start in Chat agrees with us.
3449000	3451000	The previews in Rock Band are evil.
3451000	3454000	I downloaded like three more songs because of them.
3454000	3456000	There you have it.
3456000	3461000	Well, there was a little bit more that I saw about them trying to add more features
3461000	3464000	that were based off of requests by the community, so that's pretty cool.
3464000	3470000	It's supposed to be new content every week through 2008, so that's pretty cool.
3470000	3473000	That's, of course, only in the U.S. right now.
3476000	3478000	That's pretty cool.
3478000	3483000	You know what I'm surprised they don't have yet is vision camera support
3483000	3489000	or camera support to basically film yourself doing your little rock concert shit
3489000	3492000	in front of your TV or whatever with your friends
3492000	3495000	and then posting it like a YouTube thing
3495000	3499000	with some sort of contest maybe lumped in with that,
3499000	3502000	although at the same time I'm kind of glad they don't have that
3502000	3507000	because that would be a motivation for some other people
3507000	3510000	to try to get me to do things I don't want to do.
3510000	3511000	Let's see here.
3511000	3517000	This week we've got a new download pack coming to Rock Band.
3517000	3525000	It's actually six songs from Boston and quite a few that you'll probably like here,
3525000	3529000	including, let's see here,
3529000	3532000	Hitch a Ride, More Than a Feelin',
3532000	3538000	Peace of Mind, Rock and Roll Band, Smokin' and Something About You.
3538000	3541000	So that's pretty cool.
3541000	3546000	And you can buy that in a pack for 800 Microsoft points or $10
3546000	3550000	or individually for 160 Microsoft points or $1.99 each.
3550000	3554000	So you save $2 if you buy it all.
3554000	3558000	Whatever happened to you getting that Rock Band stage kit?
3558000	3559000	When is it not out yet?
3559000	3561000	When does that come out?
3561000	3562000	June.
3562000	3563000	June?
3563000	3565000	Yeah.
3565000	3567000	We're going to have to wait that long to rock
3567000	3569000	and we won't even be able to do it on Live 365?
3569000	3570000	That sucks.
3570000	3571000	Is that right?
3571000	3574000	It's one of those things that we need to have a camera for
3574000	3578000	so we can see the entire garage being filled with smoke.
3578000	3586000	Here's a little clip of Boston if you actually need a reminder.
3586000	3589000	It's the same song that's in Guitar Hero.
3589000	3597000	And I think it's also in Cariote Revolution.
3597000	3599000	Boston is great.
3599000	3600000	Boston is pretty awesome.
3600000	3604000	I'm telling you though, I want my Queen pack, my Journey pack.
3604000	3606000	Where's my Journey pack?
3606000	3611000	I need me some Queen because that'd be awesome.
3611000	3613000	The Queen pack would be epic.
3613000	3615000	And also, you know what else we need?
3615000	3620000	We need some really kick-ass hardcore industrial stuff.
3620000	3624000	Get some bands that aren't around anymore, like Gravity Kills.
3624000	3626000	That should be awesome.
3626000	3628000	How about Tracy Lords?
3628000	3629000	That'd be awesome too.
3629000	3630000	I love Tracy Lords.
3630000	3632000	She apparently sucks live.
3632000	3634000	I'm sure she does.
3634000	3637000	She sucks on tape too.
3637000	3639000	She was funny in Crusty Baby.
3639000	3642000	Oh yeah, I love Tracy Lords as an actress.
3642000	3643000	Good stuff, wasn't she?
3643000	3645000	Well yes, she was on the NBC show.
3645000	3648000	Was it The Pretenders for the longest time?
3648000	3650000	I thought you were talking about it before.
3650000	3652000	No, I'm not that type of actress.
3652000	3656000	Although, sure, people everywhere can appreciate her fine work there.
3656000	3659000	Something else you folks can appreciate is Free Stuff.
3659000	3662000	Who doesn't like Free Stuff?
3662000	3664000	We don't if it's Yaris.
3664000	3665000	Well, this isn't Yaris.
3665000	3667000	It's actually on the Nintendo Wii.
3667000	3671000	It's sort of a, we're sorry, please forgive us type of thing.
3671000	3683000	Remember how the whole Wii Guitar Hero 3 on the Nintendo Wii only had the mono sound in it?
3683000	3687000	And they have to do all these replacement discs for the stereo sound now?
3687000	3691000	Well, you're also going to be getting a Guitar Hero face plate.
3691000	3694000	A free Guitar Hero face plate.
3694000	3696000	It's actually kind of neat looking.
3696000	3698000	It looks like fire a little bit.
3698000	3703000	It's red and yellow and black and it looks like a phoenix kind of rising up from this fire-ish looking thing.
3703000	3705000	So, it's kind of cool.
3705000	3708000	And it's small black leather and it says, please don't sue us.
3708000	3709000	Please don't sue us.
3709000	3711000	Please no class action laws here.
3711000	3714000	By accepting this face plate, you agree not to do a class action law show?
3714000	3716000	I don't know, Jamie, don't you think that looks kind of cool?
3716000	3718000	It looks better than the guitar I have in the living room.
3718000	3721000	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
3721000	3724000	Listen, I hate how the Wii mote goes in the guitar like that.
3724000	3726000	It's so weird.
3726000	3729000	But I guess it makes sense and probably makes things cost less.
3729000	3736000	But anyway, free face plate for those of you that are going to be getting the replacement discs for Guitar Hero on the Wii.
3736000	3742000	I understand. It hijacks Wi-Fi like a college student in an apartment complex.
3742000	3745000	Can we please move on with the gaming news at this time?
3745000	3747000	Sure, why not?
3747000	3754000	At least, you know, I would be more than happy to if my computer would decide that it would let me pull up the stupid file.
3754000	3756000	Sorry.
3756000	3759000	There we go.
3759000	3762000	Got none at the time?
3762000	3764000	It's all you.
3764000	3775000	Anyway, especially know that there's quite a few really hardcore fans out there who are probably listening.
3775000	3777000	I can think of one in particular.
3777000	3788000	They're actually saying that there may be another version, another song pack for Guitar Hero that would be all Beatles stuff.
3788000	3804000	And that's pretty cool, although I've been corrected as far as information in the article that their catalog cannot be distributed on iTunes because of a lawsuit going on between Apple and Apple Corp.
3804000	3807000	So I'm not going to go into all that.
3807000	3810000	Read Wikipedia.
3810000	3820000	But they said that they're trying to work about bringing a few songs out for a particular song pack, so I think that would be kind of cool.
3820000	3829000	Don't they have to get the rights back from Michael Jackson, or did he sell that stuff when he started becoming poor?
3829000	3832000	I'm not the expert.
3832000	3841000	Well, another bad idea sounds like something coming from Ubisoft with their brand new title in their Imagine series. Imagine, people actually buy this shit.
3841000	3843000	Imagine Rockstar.
3843000	3848000	It is absolutely in no way a ripoff of Rockband, I'm sure.
3848000	3854000	And it kind of revolves around fashion and stuff.
3854000	3863000	The Imagine series is meant for girls aged 6 to 14, or in the case of Jamie, she likes Imagine Babies.
3863000	3877000	And it will allow little girls, I guess, to be able to play drums, guitar, bass, and piano with each other via Wi-Fi.
3877000	3888000	And each instrument has its own unique control using the DS stylus, and players will be able to customize the look of each bandmate and create the most stylish rockers.
3888000	3891000	Only girls can play? That's not fair.
3891000	3893000	Fine, you too can play.
3893000	3895000	Yay!
3895000	3901000	And they work their way up the charts to become the number one recording band.
3901000	3904000	How is that different from Rockband?
3904000	3907000	Don't you get to dress your characters in Rockband?
3907000	3913000	You have to understand, this is shitty Rockband, not so crappy.
3913000	3916000	Oh, I'm so sorry.
3916000	3927000	But if that's not for you, there's also, of course, the rest of the Imagine series, including Imagine Figure Skater, Imagine Fashion Designer, Imagine Animal Doctor, Imagine Master Chef, and Imagine Babies.
3927000	3929000	Imagine Master Chef.
3929000	3936000	Yeah, it's funny, if you read the Master Chef really fast, it's almost like Imagine Master Chief, and that's like, hey, wait a second.
3936000	3939000	I wonder if we could get the Imagine people on the show.
3939000	3941000	I mean, why not?
3941000	3949000	Let's hear them, I don't want to say defend themselves, but let's hear about their contributions to the gaming scene.
3949000	3963000	I make fun of them because it's not my demographic, but you know what, there is a problem with a lot of games not being focused towards girls, and so they are kind of working that market.
3963000	3979000	Same with UFO Interactive, they make a lot of these, was it Smart Boys Game Room, Smart Girls Dream House type thing like that, it's games that are aimed at kids that are three years old, like really get you hooked young.
3979000	3980000	Start them young.
3980000	3991000	Exactly, so it's nice that they're aiming for this demographic, obviously though it's easy fodder for us in the press to just kind of make fun of it because we don't understand it, and it's different.
3991000	3994000	Back in my day, we had Mario is Missing, and we liked it.
3994000	4005000	Mario is Missing was great, and besides that, I personally, for some of these, I don't really feel like perpetuating any type of stereotypical behavior or traditional roles, I think that it's up to...
4005000	4014000	It's just like when Nintendo tried Super Princess Peach, and that flopped, and so they said, fuck it, boys will play games, girls will do nothing.
4014000	4016000	I play games...
4016000	4019000	I like Super Princess Peach, screw you.
4019000	4024000	I like shooting things in games, it's like...
4024000	4027000	You will play your Kirby and your Peach games and you will like them, that's it.
4027000	4028000	No...
4028000	4037000	And now the chat room is just going off with all these different imagined things, but Amaze Hetsuma, I like this one, says, imagine these games in a landfill next to E.T.
4037000	4040000	I like violent games.
4040000	4046000	Frisbee says, Peach is awesome in Brawl, that's actually true, like the two characters I use most are Pit and Peach.
4046000	4049000	I don't like the fruit fruit games.
4049000	4050000	It's like the Peach Pit.
4050000	4052000	Get it? What?
4052000	4055000	I don't like fruit fruit games, why do you think I have to play fruit fruit games?
4055000	4057000	Cause it's funny.
4057000	4058000	I want Explosive Portal.
4058000	4059000	That's the joke.
4059000	4060000	No it's not.
4060000	4062000	Do you like Final Fantasy Tactics?
4062000	4063000	No.
4063000	4070000	Well then this is not for you, Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is coming out on the Nintendo DS, and there are some folks that are big fans of Final Fantasy Tactics.
4070000	4087000	I like Final Fantasy Tactics, like the old one on the Playstation 1, I kind of lost the series since then, but this is definitely worth checking out as Final Fantasy Tactics A2, and it will be coming out June 24th is when this game is coming out.
4087000	4094000	Apparently this game has to do with the Ivalice Alliance, it's related a little more to the Final Fantasy XII series.
4094000	4096000	A little bit I guess.
4096000	4097000	Check that out loosely.
4097000	4100000	Another way to whore that series even more.
4100000	4102000	Stop whoring your Final Fantasy series.
4102000	4104000	Final Fantasy XII was a good game.
4104000	4106000	Make one game, move to the next number.
4106000	4111000	You do not need to expand upon this series in tax-dick games.
4111000	4116000	And besides, I mean, I don't know, Revenant Wings, did you play much of that?
4116000	4117000	Not really.
4117000	4119000	Yeah, okay.
4119000	4124000	Cool, you can be the killer tomato in this game, or at least I think you fight the killer tomato, that's kind of cool.
4124000	4127000	This game actually looks kind of rad.
4127000	4132000	I still need to beat Final Fantasy XII, though, and that other Final Fantasy game you bought me on DS, Loki.
4132000	4134000	Looks like fun.
4134000	4138000	I'm sure we'll be hearing from our listeners on this game.
4138000	4142000	Well, we hear from them about everything else.
4142000	4143000	I mean, hi!
4143000	4149000	No, we know Codemasters, right?
4149000	4150000	We're familiar with them.
4150000	4151000	Sure.
4151000	4161000	Codemasters Online Gaming basically said that they want to do two MMOs for home consoles.
4161000	4166000	They were saying that they've had a little bit of success already in the market,
4166000	4172000	and so they're looking to bring stuff out for PlayStation 3.
4172000	4176000	This is one of the ones listed, and they're saying that now is the right time to hop on it.
4176000	4184000	So there's not anything specific yet, but they said that they're really going to gear it for the consoles.
4184000	4190000	So I personally don't think MMOs work very well on consoles unless it's like, you know, PSO.
4190000	4195000	Here's what I'm hoping, and I know that they don't make this game, at least not Codemasters.
4195000	4200000	APB, that game that's coming out that's just like Saints Row, but it's an MMO.
4200000	4205000	I hope to God that I don't have to pay month to month for that thing, because I really want to play it, like badly.
4205000	4208000	Well, most MMOs you do have to pay month to month for.
4208000	4213000	Yeah, but Guild Wars is out, and they really need to follow that line of thought there.
4213000	4217000	Everybody, look at Guild Wars. Look at it.
4217000	4223000	And there's a lot of games out there that are free to play, and you know, you buy download content.
4223000	4227000	That's what they should do, just give out free games, and then I'll pay for download content later on.
4227000	4230000	Like Second Life?
4230000	4234000	No, Second Life is stupid. That's like if I wanted to go pick up virtual horror.
4234000	4236000	It is free, and you get what you pay for.
4236000	4238000	And you pay for your downloadable content.
4238000	4240000	Yes, but that's a game where you...
4240000	4243000	You just described Second Life.
4243000	4246000	Okay, but Second Life is a bad example, because that game sucks.
4246000	4251000	And it's not really a game, it's just an addiction. It's like the MySpace of MMOs, okay?
4251000	4256000	But it does specifically do what you were suggesting.
4256000	4258000	Okay, it does, but it sucks at it.
4258000	4264000	So, what I'm trying to say though, there's like other games out there that are also free to play,
4264000	4269000	and most of them are Korean, because apparently they understand how to make a good MMO.
4269000	4271000	Or apparently Malaysian, like one of my friends is on...
4271000	4275000	Yeah, go figure. Malaysia, you know, where a lot of piracy used to come out of,
4275000	4279000	and yet they're making good games that are free.
4279000	4282000	I don't know. That's kind of weird.
4282000	4287000	But I digress, so...
4287000	4291000	There's kind of a little bit of a different topic here,
4291000	4295000	but once again, and we haven't heard about this in a while,
4295000	4301000	Massachusetts now is considering the whole games as porn bill.
4301000	4307000	Apparently it's House Bill 1423, being dubbed of course as the games as porn bill,
4307000	4312000	would use the rationale to prevent minors from buying violent games,
4312000	4315000	because they're treating it the same as porn.
4315000	4317000	I don't understand this, because porn is way better than games.
4317000	4318000	Exactly.
4318000	4319000	Come on.
4319000	4326000	And the bill was drafted by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino,
4326000	4330000	which if he's up for re-election, remember that when you're voting.
4330000	4335000	And with the assistance from, of course,
4335000	4339000	well this right here is why the bill is bad in the first place,
4339000	4344000	Voldemort was the inspiration on that bill.
4344000	4349000	And of course, legislative sponsor,
4349000	4353000	Republican Linda, or I'm sorry,
4353000	4358000	Representative Linda Dorsina Forey,
4358000	4360000	who happens to be a Democrat.
4360000	4363000	And of course, this thing,
4363000	4365000	much like all the other ones in the past,
4365000	4368000	will fail because it's not constitutional.
4368000	4371000	But at the same time,
4371000	4375000	what do we got to do to stop these people from wasting our tax dollars
4375000	4378000	on these bills that they know they're going to fail?
4378000	4380000	You know, it's like the fucking...
4380000	4382000	Is it so that when they re-run for office,
4382000	4385000	they can say like, hey, I took a stand against this.
4385000	4386000	Yeah, it's really...
4386000	4388000	Video games are poisoning your children,
4388000	4390000	and I take a stand against this.
4390000	4392000	My name is Rob, and I approve this message.
4392000	4393000	Well, great.
4393000	4395000	So it's really for their own personal gain,
4395000	4397000	and it's still wasting taxpayers' money.
4397000	4400000	All the more reason you should hate it.
4400000	4401000	I don't know.
4401000	4404000	Do our children really need to be protected from games?
4404000	4406000	I mean, do we really need the government to step in
4406000	4408000	to tell our children what's okay to play?
4408000	4410000	I mean, are we that retarded?
4410000	4412000	I know some people are that retarded,
4412000	4414000	but I would like to think that, you know,
4414000	4417000	most of us are not that retarded.
4417000	4419000	Because if we're all that retarded,
4419000	4422000	then who the hell are we going to elect in as president?
4422000	4424000	Hey, I promise you shiny things.
4424000	4426000	Okay, you got my vote.
4426000	4429000	I don't know.
4430000	4432000	Alrighty.
4432000	4434000	Well, we'll see...
4434000	4437000	I'm sure we'll hear about this game later when it fails.
4437000	4439000	Meanwhile...
4439000	4440000	Or the bill, not the game.
4440000	4444000	Meanwhile, we're going to get to the end of part A of our show here,
4444000	4447000	but not before we pay a little respect to our elders in this segment.
4447000	4450000	We always do every single week here on the program.
4450000	4459000	It's Dark Sockra's classic video game of the week.
4459000	4461000	So Dark Sockra, you've dug through the archives,
4461000	4464000	you've verified this pick is not a duplicate per the wiki.
4464000	4468000	What classic game should the kids be checking out this week?
4468000	4470000	Jackal!
4470000	4474000	Jackal is a great game because you drive tanks and blow up shit.
4474000	4477000	Best game ever.
4477000	4480000	And yes, I'm talking about the Nintendo version specifically.
4480000	4484000	This is when the music is cool.
4484000	4485000	How is that?
4485000	4488000	I used to play this game.
4488000	4492000	It's like Akari Warriors, but you're in a jeep.
4492000	4496000	Yeah, this is the game that makes me think of that line from Hot Shots.
4496000	4499000	War is fantastic.
4499000	4501000	But no, which I don't really believe.
4501000	4503000	But anyway, I love Jackal just because...
4503000	4509000	Okay, I actually have memories of this game before my papa, who is my dad's dad.
4509000	4513000	Before he died, we would actually sit in front of the big screen TV.
4513000	4517000	And we're talking like, you know, early 90's style big screen.
4517000	4519000	So this was a big deal.
4519000	4523000	Playing the Nintendo and playing Jackal with papa, that was great.
4523000	4529000	But the game actually, it was an arcade released in Japan.
4529000	4534000	It was called Tokusho Butai Jackaru, which would be Jackal.
4534000	4540000	Special Forces Unit Jackal, which was released in the US as Top Gunner.
4540000	4545000	Basically, the whole point of the game is you go through and you can run over...
4545000	4549000	Well, I like to run them over, but you can shoot down enemy soldiers wandering around.
4549000	4556000	And you rescue POWs and you have to actually take them to the extraction point where a helicopter will run off with them.
4556000	4563000	And then you fight like whatever your boss is at the end of the level.
4563000	4571000	But again, it came out over here in the arcade as Top Gunner, but it did come out as Jackal on the Nintendo.
4571000	4580000	Also though, for anyone who happened to be one of those few people who has a Famicom Disk System,
4580000	4592000	it was brought out as Final Commando Akaiyousai, which basically is Final Command The Red Fortress.
4592000	4599000	The game is just really fun. On top of that, when you play two player, it does force you to cooperate.
4599000	4606000	Because it gets to a point where if one person is going one way, it won't let your other person advance.
4606000	4610000	And sometimes one person can draw fire while the other person goes in and does something else.
4610000	4617000	It's really a unique one for the whole Run and Gun series.
4617000	4624000	You can actually blow up different areas in the game where there's hidden stuff.
4624000	4631000	You can get extra power-ups, you can get rocket launchers, or you can get...
4631000	4638000	I actually preferred to keep the grenades because the grenades would go over a wall, whereas rockets just sort of explode on the wall.
4638000	4642000	It was really cool.
4642000	4648000	I like how you pick up the little dudes. I didn't play this game a whole lot. I think I remember playing it once and I just wasn't that into it when I was younger.
4648000	4656000	But I like how you pick up the little dudes in the houses and drop them off at the plane. It's like a rescue mission thing. It's cool.
4656000	4669000	You can, though, keep upgrading your missiles to where you get your missile launcher, you get one with a higher range, you get one that produces shrapnel, and an area damage missile that shoots out from left and right.
4669000	4674000	I still preferred the grenades because they went over the walls.
4674000	4681000	You can also control which direction you fire in, which was pretty cool. You can turn and fire forward in a different way.
4681000	4693000	I mean, it's like a tank. So, it was really cool. It's one of my favorite ever games. On top of that, I actually have really good memories of the game, so it was kind of cool.
4693000	4705000	And also, there was a bootleg version of Top Gunner that would let you use the Ikari Warriors-style control. That was pretty cool.
4705000	4717000	It had a version on the IBM PC in 1988, like I said, the Famicom Disk System, and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.
4717000	4721000	Or the inevitable Xbox Live Arcade port at some point, probably.
4721000	4722000	Could you imagine this Hi-Rez?
4722000	4723000	That would be pretty awesome.
4723000	4724000	Sweet.
4724000	4735000	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Jackal, in this case on the NES, but on a variety of systems, as DarkSakura pointed out. Check it out.
4735000	4740000	All right, and that's our cue to take a quick break, so that's exactly what we're going to do.
4740000	4746000	We're going to take a break, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.
4746000	4752000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice a week.
4752000	4757000	Tune to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
