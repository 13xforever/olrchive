00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,300
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Easter Sunday, March 23rd of 2008.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,500
We are live here in the studio.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,900
We had some unfortunate news a little earlier on.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,500
If you haven't heard it yet, go back and listen to part A.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Big changes coming to OLR very soon.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,200
And hopefully next week we'll have more information on that for you.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,800
But in the meantime, the show goes on and it will go on as it always has.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,000
And it will go on right now with Loki spreading the rumors.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, and this rumor keeps coming back around.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,600
Remember last week we talked a bit about Reggie teasing

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,400
that they're going to announce a major holiday blockbuster game

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,200
that will be coming, or the announcement will be coming at E3.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,100
And of course, people are speculating on what the hell that is.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,800
We thought maybe Animal Crossing.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,800
However, some people over at IGN think it might be Kid Icarus because...

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,600
Hey, wait a minute. That was my Dark Horse pick.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,800
Copiers? Plagiarists?

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,300
But according to the latest Nintendo voice chat podcast,

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:31,800
Matt Casamassina, and I guess the rest of their crew there,

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,500
were speculating that they thought it was Kid Icarus

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,200
because they know it's in the works.

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
How do they know it's in the works?

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,600
I don't fucking know, nor do I care.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,500
To be honest, as much as I think Kid Icarus is pretty cool,

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,200
I don't think that's going to be a blockbuster game, you know what I mean?

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,600
Unless it has Mario and shit in it.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,100
Unfortunately, the casual gamer out there,

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,000
I mean, like your mom and pops, probably we don't give a shit about Kid Icarus.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,600
I don't know, I think you underestimate the fanboys.

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,400
I would say that it'd be cool if a Kid Icarus game came out.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,100
I don't think it's the game he's talking about.

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,200
I think Animal Crossing is the game he's talking about,

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
but if there is a Kid Icarus game in the works,

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,600
I mean, they'll be pretty big, but...

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,200
I don't think it is the game that they're going to be announcing.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,600
I think it could be a game they're announcing.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,900
Yeah, a game, yes.

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,200
The game, no.

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,900
Well, then, Loki, consider this news, and we're going to come back and talk about this,

44
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,300
but I want to get out this news,

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,600
is that Super Smash Bros. Brawl shatters records everywhere.

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,400
1.4 million sold in the first week it's been out in the US.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,900
That's crazy, 874,000 of those on the day it was released alone.

48
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,600
That makes it the fastest selling video game in Nintendo of America's history,

49
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
dating all the way back to the NES.

50
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,700
And, you know, no surprise, this game was going to be a big seller,

51
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,900
but this was a, like, really big seller.

52
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,000
The game is sold at a rate of more than 120 units per minute

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,400
between the day it launched, March 9th and March 16th.

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,400
So that is a huge selling game.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,600
And RosteelUT, though, is the first to point out...

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,800
He's Debbie Downer UT right now.

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,900
He says, still slower than Halo 3.

58
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,900
Wah, wah.

59
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,400
But, I mean, it is kind of a good point.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,200
It didn't sell quite as much as some of the guys on Xbox did,

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,700
but still a huge seller for Nintendo nonetheless.

62
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,200
Yeah.

63
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,000
And also you have to remember, too,

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,300
that they don't have as many units of the Wii right now as they do the 360.

65
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,300
They're still number two in the US.

66
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,200
But, I mean, not by much, so that doesn't really make a big difference.

67
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,500
Is it a big deal that it didn't meet up to those Halo 3-type numbers?

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,400
No, I don't think they were ever...

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,000
It made history for Nintendo,

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
so I think that they're more than pleased about it.

71
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,300
I don't think they really have to live up to being like Halo,

72
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,500
because you know what?

73
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,900
Fucking Grand Theft Auto's gonna outsell Halo anyways,

74
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,200
so who gives a shit about your fucking Halo numbers right now?

75
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I mean, that's gonna get blown out of the water soon anyways.

76
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,700
So, I don't know.

77
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,100
And really, Halo 3, yeah, it sold a lot

78
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,000
because there was so much hype behind it and shit,

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,900
but was it really that great of a game?

80
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,100
All right, so going back to the story earlier about Kid Icarus,

81
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,800
would it be a game that people would recognize or not?

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
This is a huge game.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
Pit is a character in the game.

84
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,500
It does a good job at kind of reminding you that Kid Icarus is out there,

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,200
what with the virtual console thing and the stages and the music.

86
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,000
You know, it's one of the first things you see in Subspace Emissary,

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
is the whole Pit coming to life thing.

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,600
True, but does that mean we're also gonna get like a Rob the Robot,

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,500
which I would totally buy that day.

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,400
I would totally buy that day one, absolutely.

91
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,500
Fuck yes, bring back Rob the Robot.

92
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,900
In fact, make my old one compatible with the Wii.

93
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,700
That would be cool,

94
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,600
because then mine would actually be good for something other than sitting on the shelf.

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,300
Yeah, I mean, like,

96
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,000
can Rob do anything besides spin things?

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
You know what they need to know?

98
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,600
You know what they need to do with Rob the Robot?

99
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,500
They need to make it like one of those fucking Robosapien things,

100
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,200
or like fucking Furbies where you can program the shit out of that.

101
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,400
Or the, uh, what, Ibo?

102
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,800
Ibo, yeah.

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Just, like, something like that, just like really crazy, you know,

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,900
get people to buy that shit that wouldn't have a Wii or something like that,

105
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,800
and just go crazy with it.

106
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
But, I mean, I don't know about you guys, but like,

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
when I was playing Smash Brothers Brawl,

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,800
and I played that Subspace Emissary mode,

109
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
and I saw the Kid Icarus thing,

110
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,800
and with the music and him flying through the air, flying down to Earth,

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,500
and with the music playing, I'm like,

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,700
God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game now.

113
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,800
Like, that was initially the first thought in my mind,

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
and I think we might have even been broadcasting on Justin.TV,

115
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,100
uh, when, when I was doing that in the game,

116
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,800
and I, I seem to remember exclaiming,

117
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,800
God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game right now.

118
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,100
Like, a new one.

119
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
Maybe.

120
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,800
I hope so.

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,400
Uh, Tiger Claw says if they do the new Kid Icarus,

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,800
it's no doubt that they would also have to bring back the Eggplant Wizard.

123
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
Hell yes, the Eggplant Wizard was also a very memorable character.

124
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
Everybody knew him as the annoyingest little fucker in video gaming history.

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
One of the most annoying characters, seriously.

126
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,600
You know what's great, though, about being turned into an eggplant, though?

127
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,100
What?

128
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,600
Is it if you press down to where you can see his feet,

129
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,100
and then you slide across the floor as an eggplant?

130
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,600
Yes.

131
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
It's like, it's like, uh, Metal Gear Solid Eggplant.

132
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,100
It's great!

133
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
I know, I love that, too.

134
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,600
You just hope that nothing saw you.

135
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,600
And, and you can even hold it down and jump as an eggplant,

136
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
and that was great, too.

137
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,600
And you, and, and who knew that hospitals could cure the eggplant curse?

138
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,100
I know!

139
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,600
Although, you could also turn into an eggplant from watching too much TV.

140
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
This is true.

141
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Well, anyhow, uh, huge numbers for Smash Bros. Brawl,

142
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
and I'm sure this game's just gonna continue to sell through Christmas,

143
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
so, uh, we'll see how it holds up throughout the year.

144
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Well, in other news, dun dun dun.

145
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Okay, well,

146
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,600
we know we were talking about how Namco was talking about, you know,

147
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,600
not too many people are, uh, playing their games.

148
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Well, I should say Bandai Namco.

149
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Um, but now they're talking about, well, actually, they'd also blamed it on the Wii, too,

150
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
which I think is kind of stupid.

151
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
But now they're talking about, um, bringing out games, um,

152
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,600
that will combine the arcade and Wii titles to where,

153
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I guess they'll, they'll share scores or that they'll have some sort of interactivity,

154
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
but it would be for a data exchange between the different versions of the games.

155
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
And you know what I have to say about that?

156
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Neo Geo.

157
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,100
And you know what I have to say about that?

158
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,600
F-Zero GX.

159
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,600
And you know what I have to say about that?

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Nothing. I just wanted to join in.

161
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,600
No, seriously, though, I mean, they were part of the whole Triforce system that, you know,

162
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
I think that was only pretty much used for the F-Zero GX stuff,

163
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,600
but, uh, you know, it had cross, uh, platform stuff between, um, the arcade and the GameCube,

164
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
so let's do something similar with SD memory cards,

165
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
because those are widely available.

166
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,100
Fuck, what, two gig memory card for, uh, $9.99 at Fry's today.

167
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
That's pretty awesome.

168
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:17,100
Um, but anyways, they've got, you know, they could do that very simple and exchange data back and forth.

169
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,600
I think it's smart to make arcades like a gamer's hub,

170
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,600
and I know that kind of sounds like a big duh type of answer,

171
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,600
but I think it's smart to kind of make your arcade games somehow talk to the console games

172
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,600
and give gamers a reason to sort of convene in one place, in real life, outside,

173
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
you know, not having to use Xbox Live and rely on that type of stuff.

174
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I think these kind of ideas are smart.

175
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Can you imagine, like, a Smash Bros. arcade game or something like that,

176
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,100
like, done on a huge screen, you know, with four, uh, joysticks, you know, set up and stuff,

177
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,100
and then have, like, additional characters and all that stuff?

178
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,600
Or things that unlock based on what you do on the home version, and things like that.

179
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,100
Absolutely. That would be rad.

180
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
sj100matt in chat says,

181
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Loki, one could dream.

182
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
I agree, one could dream.

183
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,100
So, we'll see what happens with this.

184
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Another cool thing that probably will never come to fruition, but, you know,

185
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,100
at least with all the buzz that's going around about it,

186
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,600
but a fan of Metroid 2 is actually working on a remake of the game

187
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
that he's been working on right now for about three years now.

188
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Metroid 2 Return of Samus.

189
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,100
Um, awesome looking thing.

190
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
He's using sprites from Metroid Zero Mission,

191
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,600
as well as the remake of the classic Game Boy game,

192
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,100
and some other sprites.

193
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,100
He's also hand-drawing from the ground-up, I guess, Metroid Fusion,

194
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
which is the other game he's using,

195
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,100
and using the program Game Maker 7,

196
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,600
the guy who goes by Dr. M64,

197
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,100
and totally awesome looking game so far.

198
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,100
They've actually got a, I guess, not really a beta or demo,

199
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,100
but a proof-of-concept demo, I guess, that you can download and play

200
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
straight off of a bunch of websites,

201
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
and if you're interested in checking it out,

202
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,100
it's metroid2remake.blogspot.com for the website.

203
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,100
And we have a little YouTube that TigerClaw sent us of this in action.

204
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Neat, looks like Super Metroid.

205
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,100
I imagine that's not the sound in-game.

206
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
No, they actually do have an in-game...

207
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
I don't think this is it, though, is it?

208
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
No, that's the actual game, but that's not the...

209
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Damn, the game looks good, though.

210
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
It looks like Super Metroid.

211
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
That's not a bad thing.

212
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Nice wall jumping.

213
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I approve. This looks good.

214
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Yeah, I hope the project doesn't get shut down by players or something.

215
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Oh, there you have it.

216
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Mackman says, oh shit, I thought it was going to be a Rickroll.

217
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
No, I trust TigerClaw's links.

218
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Some of you other people, I don't know so much.

219
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
I might get Rickrolled by you,

220
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,100
so don't think I'm not going to check.

221
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Rickroll, you get blacklisted.

222
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
That's right, you Rickroll me, I ban you.

223
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
That shit was funny like three months ago.

224
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,100
It's a little old now, so please do not be Rickrolling.

225
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Anyhow, Metroid 2, yes, I approve.

226
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,100
And I hope the project doesn't get Rickrolled by lawyers.

227
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
That would suck.

228
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Just like, was it the 3D remake of Chrono Trigger?

229
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
That sucks.

230
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Oh, that thing looked hot, too.

231
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
You remember seeing that that game looked hot.

232
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
They apparently are making the full version.

233
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
The people they're working on, they're going to make it for themselves,

234
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
but they can't release it because...

235
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Oh, that shit will end up a bit torn so fast.

236
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Well, they still could get in trouble, I think.

237
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Yeah.

238
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,100
All right, anyhow, today is Easter,

239
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
and so I guess this news is going to be a little bit old

240
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
for some of our podcast listeners,

241
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
but this is just too cool.

242
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Some people were seeing this earlier this week.

243
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,100
Nintendo Miis, as in the characters that you create on Wiis,

244
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,100
were being used to advertise Easter service at a San Francisco church.

245
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Yes, that's right.

246
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,100
They used a little Mii that looks like Jesus

247
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,100
standing next to a bunny that looks a little grumpy,

248
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
and the little postcard says,

249
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Come and Follow Mii, M-I-I.

250
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,100
And it was Easter Sunday, which was today at 11 a.m.

251
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
at the Mission Bay Community Church.

252
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,100
So, you know, just clever ways of advertising.

253
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
And, you know, I like churches that are hip and with it,

254
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,100
and I like churches that don't feel like

255
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
they're still living in the Old Testament.

256
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Did you see the one that was the wedding invitation

257
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
that had the two Miis on there?

258
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,100
No, I don't think I saw that.

259
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,100
And then when you open it up, it says, Wife Get.

260
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,100
That's awesome.

261
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
That's awesome.

262
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
That sounds like something that Mel and Mel,

263
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,100
my buddies would be doing for their wedding.

264
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Sounds like something they would do.

265
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Nice.

266
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
That actually, yeah.

267
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
That is very cute.

268
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,100
I like cute, innovative ways of doing things.

269
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
All right, bless you.

270
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Are you okay?

271
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
I'm allergic to...

272
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Something here in the studio?

273
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Are you allergic to me?

274
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
Are you allergic to Jesus?

275
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
That might be a problem.

276
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Mildly.

277
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
All right.

278
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Well, hopefully you're not allergic to mail

279
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
because this is the part of the show

280
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
where you're going to read some for us

281
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
as the listeners email us

282
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,100
at mailbag at orangesonsradio.com.

283
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Did we get better participation this week than last week?

284
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Well, we did get some interesting emails

285
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,100
and one of them is from our friend Rob Booktubes,

286
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,100
but he didn't provide the link to the article in the email,

287
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,100
so he's basically just talking about an article

288
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
about the outcome of the guy who,

289
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
I'm just going to read this from the start.

290
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Here's a pretty good article on the outcome of that guy

291
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,100
who bludgeoned a baby to death for accidentally breaking the Xbox.

292
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
Some interesting stuff in that article.

293
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,100
One, the article does not imply

294
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
the guy was playing his Xbox at the time.

295
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Two, the article does not specify

296
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,100
if the murder happened immediately after the Xbox broke

297
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,100
or when Spellman the convicted discovered it.

298
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Three, social workers visited the house regularly

299
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,100
and four, the autopsy showed evidence of prior abuse.

300
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,100
It implies a pattern of abuse that shows the man

301
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
was a ticking time bomb.

302
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
As you said when the story probably came out,

303
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
it wasn't really about games at all.

304
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,100
So...

305
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,100
Exactly.

306
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Pretty much, you know, it's no surprise

307
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,100
that the media, you know, hopped all over this

308
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
trying to make it a video game thing

309
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
when it really had nothing to do with that.

310
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
No surprise there.

311
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
But thanks for the update, nevertheless.

312
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
I'm not saying that at you.

313
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
I'm just saying that in general.

314
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Like, here goes the media again.

315
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Video games are evil.

316
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Blah, blah, blah.

317
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Big surprise.

318
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Well, also, Nige linked me a story on CBBC

319
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100
that is actually pretty cool.

320
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:13,100
It's more just pictures of a bunch of people.

321
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
A lot of people dressed up as Mario,

322
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,100
but also others dressed up as different characters.

323
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Like, there's a giant Spyro here,

324
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
a very well-made costume,

325
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
just walking around that says

326
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
they're trying to break a record,

327
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
but I don't see...

328
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
They broke a record for the most cosplayers

329
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
in one spot, I guess,

330
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
or something like 80.

331
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
It was just 80 cosplayers.

332
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,100
What?

333
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,100
I think the average anime convention

334
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
could break that, like, in a heartbeat.

335
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I think specifically, though,

336
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
that these are all video game characters.

337
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Speaking of anime conventions,

338
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
I was told via a text message earlier this week,

339
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
I don't know if it actually ended up happening or not,

340
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
because I didn't get any text messages tonight,

341
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
but I'm being told that our show is right now

342
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
being played at Anime Boston.

343
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
So if that's true,

344
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
a big hello to you kids at Anime Boston.

345
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
And you know who sent me a text message,

346
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,100
so I know for a fact you guys are listening in there,

347
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
because I don't see anybody in chat or what have you.

348
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
But then again, my phone's in the house,

349
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
so maybe that's what happened.

350
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Well, if you've got the mind, text me.

351
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Yeah, there you go.

352
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
Well, that's pretty cool.

353
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Hi, people.

354
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
And here's the thing.

355
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
What you need to do right now,

356
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
or not right now because you're listening to the show,

357
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
but as soon as the show's over,

358
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
all you bitches need to get your cosplay gear on

359
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,100
and get 81 of you together and shatter the record.

360
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Do it.

361
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Dude, I would participate in that one

362
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
if I had a finished costume right now.

363
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Yeah, the record was for the largest gathering of game characters,

364
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
or games characters.

365
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
All right, so you guys have to dig through your luggage

366
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
and get your game ones specifically.

367
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Just gather a whole crap load of Guilty Gear cosplayers.

368
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
You'll be happy and done.

369
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
And remember, would Naruto count?

370
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Because technically they have Naruto games,

371
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,100
but Naruto is an anime character.

372
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
That's kind of a gray area.

373
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,100
In fact, a lot of anime characters are games in Japan, right?

374
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
I think it counts.

375
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
Next email.

376
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
All right, yes, next email.

377
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
And this is from GS68.

378
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Hey, O.O.R. Crew, since Dark Sakura,

379
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,100
if I recall correctly, isn't going to fight on me this year,

380
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
will you still do a panel there?

381
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,100
It's one of the things I looked forward to last year.

382
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,100
If we are invited to, then yes.

383
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
I don't see why not.

384
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Do we always submit?

385
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
I thought somebody submitted for us.

386
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
You always have to submit.

387
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
I submitted the last two years.

388
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
Are they accepting right now?

389
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Yes.

390
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Oh, I guess we have to submit then.

391
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
I don't know.

392
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Loki, are we still going to do a panel?

393
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Sure, I can try that.

394
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Why not?

395
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
We'll bring a mannequin.

396
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
I'll let you take one of my doffies.

397
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
And put an angry face on it.

398
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
We'll say it's Chibi.

399
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
I'll make you a very small doffie to take with you.

400
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,100
Yeah, we'll still do a panel if they'll let us.

401
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Why not?

402
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Well, next email.

403
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Hello, it's DJ Jinai again.

404
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Thanks for reading my email last week.

405
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
I was surprised.

406
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,100
I knew about the Smile DK news for a good month.

407
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
As soon as it was okay to release the news to the public,

408
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
O.O.R. was the first place I went to tell.

409
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
A bit about me.

410
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Yes, I'm an actual DJ and I live in Las Vegas.

411
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Arcades are still alive here.

412
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
I usually mix anime and video game music.

413
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
But when it comes to DJ anime conventions,

414
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,100
I got my start as a DJ at Fanime Con 2002.

415
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
That's cool.

416
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,100
I'll be going to San Japan Con to meet with Smile DK.

417
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
I might faint when I meet them.

418
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Hee hee.

419
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Other conventions I'll be attending are

420
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
AntiJam in Fresno, California

421
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,100
and Anime Vegas Con in, wait for it, Las Vegas, Gasp.

422
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
So yes, I have a Wii and I will be waiting for Mario Kart Wii.

423
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,100
I'm surprised that they removed snaking.

424
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Well, I'll find another new strategy to overcome that mwahaha.

425
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
I'm also surprised at how easy it is to find Brawl

426
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,100
and still no Wii consoles to be found.

427
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
I haven't eaten at Olive Garden yet.

428
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
I want to have my first Olive Garden experience with O.L.R.

429
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I can only dream.

430
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Bye, DJ Genai.

431
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
P.S. You pronounce my name right.

432
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100
You win an internet and a Mudkip X3.

433
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
You know, ironically enough,

434
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
I might actually be going to Vegas in a couple months,

435
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
so it's on.

436
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Olive Garden like what?

437
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
There's a good Olive Garden in town,

438
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,100
which I hope there's got to be in Las Vegas, right?

439
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,100
There's got to be.

440
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
There's got to be an Olive Garden.

441
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,100
No, there's no Olive Garden in Las Vegas.

442
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
That would suck.

443
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Suck for Vegas.

444
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,100
So I'm like, I seem to recall I was in the middle of BFE Pennsylvania

445
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
and there was an Olive Garden there.

446
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,100
I wouldn't be surprised if there was the Olive Garden casino in the works.

447
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,100
DJ Genai is in chat and says, yes, there is an Olive Garden.

448
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
If I get three breadsticks,

449
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
does the machine spit out never-ending breadsticks?

450
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
And Sauce confirmed that there are a few.

451
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Thank you.

452
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,100
And the reason I pronounced your name right is because I'm not Rob.

453
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Rob Steele, shut up.

454
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
And Rob Steele UT has a good point.

455
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,100
He says, why would you go to Vegas and then go to Olive's shithouse?

456
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,100
That's actually a good point because Vegas has so many great restaurants.

457
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Why the fuck would I go to Olive Garden?

458
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
I'll tell you where I would want to go.

459
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Where?

460
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,100
I would want to go to the Rio and go to the seafood buffet,

461
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,100
the massive seafood buffet that I went to on the DDR Freak moderator trip

462
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
that ate a lot of my money.

463
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
I need to go back to Quark's Bar.

464
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Get me a warp core breach.

465
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
I can do one of those myself.

466
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,100
I am so going to Vegas in a couple months.

467
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
I can't wait.

468
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
I want to go.

469
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
My 30th birthday.

470
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
I still have to get you your present, you know.

471
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
I know.

472
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
I already bought you your present.

473
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Your birthday's not until next month.

474
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
I am.

475
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Well, I love my present, but I have a special present for you

476
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,100
that falls in line with my present from my 30th.

477
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Sweet.

478
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
I'll be looking forward to that.

479
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
I'll be looking forward to helping you with it.

480
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
All right.

481
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,100
No, we have more e-mails.

482
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Yay.

483
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,100
If you are ready for said e-mail.

484
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,100
This is, hey guys, let's have tea here.

485
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
Cool, I'd like some tea.

486
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Thank you.

487
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Oh, wish I could be listening live tonight,

488
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
but I'm on a plane right now flying home,

489
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,100
so there's not really internet access on airplanes.

490
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,100
Anyhow, years back, Rob did a review on trace memory

491
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
for the Nintendo DS.

492
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Trace memory is actually called another code

493
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,100
outside the US for any international listeners,

494
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,100
and he went off on how amazing the game is.

495
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,100
After I heard that episode, I went out and bought the game,

496
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
and I agree with his reaction to it.

497
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
It was an amazing game.

498
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Recently, I found a game that was made by the same company.

499
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Hotel Duskroom 215 uses DS in the same way that trace memory did,

500
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
but with a little more guidance to it.

501
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Oftentimes, in trace memory, I'd get lost and confused,

502
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,100
but that rarely happened in Hotel Dusk.

503
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,100
The puzzles in Hotel Dusk are generally pretty neat

504
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
and are excellent ways to use the touch screen.

505
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
The game is so incredibly well written

506
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
that it feels like you're actually interacting with the other people in the hotel.

507
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Excuse me.

508
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
And for those of you who have no clue what trace memory is,

509
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,100
it's a point-and-click adventure game that uses the DS hardware to the fullest.

510
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,100
The game is filled with all sorts of little puzzles that you have to solve,

511
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
and most of them are very well thought out.

512
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,100
There's even one puzzle where you have to shut the DS

513
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,100
just so that you can see the reflection from one side of the screen and the other

514
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,100
in order to understand a riddle.

515
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,100
At any rate, check out both of these games.

516
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Very goodbyes.

517
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,100
Take care, and please don't forget to save the podcast feed.

518
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
I'll need something to listen to on the flight back.

519
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got it taken care of now.

520
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
You know what's funny?

521
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,100
I've never played trace memory, so I don't know how I reviewed it on the show.

522
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,100
I have a feeling it was Miklotov that played it.

523
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Yeah, it wasn't him.

524
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,100
I think it was Miklotov, not me.

525
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:41,100
And I've been advised that you need to go to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

526
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,100
Ooh, Margaritas. I'm down with that.

527
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Okay.

528
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
So, last email.

529
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
No!

530
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
I need tragic music for this.

531
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
Anyway.

532
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,100
What was the song in Beatmania 4th Mix that was the Gothi song?

533
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
I don't know.

534
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Hey, OLR. Shout-on here.

535
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,100
I was going through some old episodes somewhere in the late 100s,

536
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:11,100
and noticed that Rob at one point brought up Feel the Magic and repeatedly griped about Sprung.

537
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
This got me thinking.

538
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Have any of you ever been interested in the visual novel genre?

539
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Not many visual novels have been brought over to the US,

540
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,100
the Ace Attorney series being among the most well-known one on American shores.

541
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,100
However, many more visual novels that are, in my opinion,

542
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,100
vastly superior to the Ace Attorney series are unlikely to be released outside of Japan,

543
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,100
even though it wouldn't be a big deal to edit them like with many other games.

544
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,100
So I guess the main question of this paragraph would be whether or not any of you,

545
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,100
mainly Jamie, have imported or pirated Japanese visual novels such as Fate,

546
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Stay Night, Tsukihime, or Clannad,

547
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,100
two of which have been fairly popular anime based off of them.

548
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,100
I mean, FSN and Clannad, there was no Tsukihime anime.

549
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Was that just fan art?

550
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Actually, I did have one, and I actually heard of this one when the Sega CD was new,

551
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,100
and it was called Takaru.

552
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:14,100
I had remembered seeing that they were going to bring it out in the US,

553
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,100
but it never did on Sega CD, if I recall correctly.

554
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,100
However, I have a PC version of it that's fully translated.

555
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,100
I've definitely heard of Clannad before, but I haven't played it myself.

556
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,100
I've heard of the band.

557
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Yeah, I hope I'm not getting confused with the band.

558
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
No, I'm pretty sure I'm not. I've heard of the game.

559
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
I think that's Enya's sister.

560
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Anyway, there's a few of them that I've heard of,

561
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:46,100
and they sort of did something like that one for the Silent Hill comics too,

562
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
at least they tried to, but it didn't.

563
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,100
It was more just like, oh, we're going to have dramatic music with the comic book panels.

564
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Okay, so that wasn't quite the same thing.

565
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Anyway, moving forward.

566
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Anyway, the next question involves an email you received last week

567
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,100
that concerned the length of arcade shooters like Gradius being too short.

568
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,100
I completely agree with Jamie that taking the time to get a high score or play through

569
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,100
on one credit in games like these gives bragging rights.

570
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,100
This is doubly true of much more difficult games like Japanese Danmaku

571
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:23,100
or bullet hell shooters like Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, or Mushihime-sama.

572
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,100
So this leads to my next question.

573
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:31,100
Have any of you ever played any games from the popular PC Danmaku shooter series Toho?

574
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,100
The Toho game started on the PC-98 with a game called Highly Responsive to Prayers.

575
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,100
The game series features a perpetual protagonist named Reimu Hakurei,

576
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:48,100
a Miko who operates an unpopular and out-of-the-way shrine in the land called Gensokyo.

577
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Toho's first appearance on Windows was the embodiment of Scarlet Devil,

578
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,100
so if it catches your interest, I would recommend starting with that.

579
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,100
The games are very popular for their music, art style, and curtains fire pattern

580
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,100
and sense of inner game character development.

581
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,100
The games are available for free download on doujinstyle.com,

582
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:16,100
and I would definitely advise anyone who still has fond memories of Radiant Silver Gun to check the series out.

583
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Keep up your exemplary work, Charon.

584
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,100
I have not played those games, but due to that well-worded free plug, I just might.

585
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:38,100
I'm familiar with Toho's games, but if it was PC, I hardly played it, so I was more of a... I'd brought up Bongayo before. That was one of my favorites.

586
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,100
I mean, it was more of a recent one, but I like those kinds of games.

587
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Actually, I really, really love Radiant Silver Gun.

588
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Alright, well then this sounds like something you ought to check out, too.

589
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Well, I was actually pretty thrilled that when, um, that had the aforementioned DDR Freak moderatorship.

590
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,100
We went to this place called, um, I want to say Game Land?

591
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:08,100
They've gone out of business since. This was probably in 2000... something?

592
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
I don't really remember when.

593
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Um, but I found a Radiant Silver Gun arcade machine.

594
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
And played the hell out of it!

595
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Everyone's like, ooh, Mambo a Go-Go! Let's go play that!

596
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
And I'm like, fuck no! I played that, and uh...

597
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Mambo a Go-Go was kind of cool, though.

598
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:29,100
It is. But I was too busy on Radiant Silver Gun and Biohazard Gun Survivor 2.

599
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Ah.

600
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Alright, so that's it for the emails?

601
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Yes.

602
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Then you have to say, no more emails.

603
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
No more emails!

604
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
That's the best ever.

605
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
You said you wanted some type of sound effects.

606
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
That was really tragic. That's more humorous.

607
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Alright, if you want to send us an email,

608
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send them.

609
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,100
Meanwhile, we get back into the news, don't we, Loki?

610
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Yes, we do.

611
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,100
Um, so, hopefully you haven't bought this already,

612
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
because if you did, you just wasted some money,

613
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:14,100
but, um, Bungie is now going to be putting out the Halo 3 Legendary Map Pack.

614
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,100
I believe it was previously $10.

615
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Um, and included three maps.

616
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Out for free, starting at 2 AM this Tuesday.

617
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,100
So, that sucks.

618
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,100
But, um, hey, it's free.

619
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
And, um, you know what, though?

620
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,100
If you're still interested in spending some money on maps,

621
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
there are some more coming the next Map Pack,

622
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,100
which is going to include a Sign Winder remake,

623
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,100
or I guess a spiritual remake,

624
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,100
including other ones known as Ghost Town,

625
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,100
and one other mystery map, I guess.

626
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,100
That's going to be coming on the 15th of April.

627
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Or if you're like me, you're like,

628
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,100
Halo 3 got new maps?

629
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
Yeah.

630
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,100
Like, I stopped playing Halo 3 months ago.

631
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
Now you can go download them,

632
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,100
and then you might as well wait until these maps become free as well,

633
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
because, you know.

634
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Yeah, no, I only download them after they're free.

635
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
I don't need to pay for them.

636
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
And, like, I don't know.

637
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
I used to play Halo 2 with my college buddies a lot,

638
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,100
but we really haven't been playing Halo 3.

639
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
It's kind of sad.

640
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
Well, what was it?

641
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,100
They had a map that they released in the last Map Pack

642
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
that I want to say was empty,

643
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,100
and it was just this big empty warehouse that you could build stuff with.

644
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Nice.

645
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
And it's like, you know,

646
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
but you can build all these cool things and forge with it.

647
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,100
It's like, thanks, but you really didn't do anything.

648
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
You just made an empty warehouse, you idiot.

649
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,100
So, I don't know.

650
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,100
All right, well, you can check that out soon.

651
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,100
One guy who might actually be back into checking this out

652
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,100
was the really depressed guy who had his Xbox 360 ruined by Microsoft.

653
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,100
Do you remember this?

654
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,100
He had his personalized 360.

655
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,100
It was white clean when he did the whole Red Ring of Death fix.

656
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
Remember that?

657
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,100
Yeah.

658
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
They cleared it all away.

659
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,100
PR Nightmare, this story ended up on blogs everywhere.

660
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
Well, guess what?

661
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,100
Apparently, a recent delivery has come from Microsoft back to the same guy.

662
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,100
It came with an Xbox 360, a handful of games,

663
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,100
and what you should definitely pay attention to is that this new Xbox 360

664
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,100
was signed by the entire Xbox team,

665
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Bungie, which had also replacement artwork on it by Rooster Teeth Comics' Luke McKay,

666
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,100
and Bill Gates signed the front of it.

667
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,100
So, he got more than he had before.

668
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,100
Yeah, he got a care package from Bungie and also from Microsoft.

669
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,100
Way to kiss ass.

670
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,100
So, this will probably be the last time you ever hear about this story on the blogs,

671
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,100
and now everyone everywhere is screaming,

672
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Microsoft, fuck up my 360.

673
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,100
I want a cool little care package like this.

674
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,100
Dude, the art's pretty cool on it.

675
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
Yeah, that's pretty rad.

676
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Watch this guy just turn around and sell it on eBay.

677
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,100
That would be tragic.

678
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,100
That would be funny.

679
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,100
I want them to draw on my Xbox now.

680
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Anyway.

681
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
They should have a service where you can send in your Xbox and get it drawn on.

682
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
I guess that is a little silly.

683
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,100
I would be happy to provide that service.

684
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:28,100
You pay me $200 and I will customize your Xbox 360 with a Sharpie.

685
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Although I'm actually not joking.

686
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Send me your faceplate and I'll customize it.

687
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
If that is a contest, we should get a blank faceplate.

688
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
They have blank faceplates, right?

689
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
We can customize it somehow.

690
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
We have some of the Ace Combat ones that we can paint over.

691
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Okay, that'll work.

692
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Well, you can just get a faceplate off of a core system or something,

693
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
and they're white.

694
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
Oh, there you go.

695
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Or actually all the original faceplates are white.

696
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
That might be fun.

697
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Something to do.

698
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
I have some extra ones.

699
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
All right, anyway.

700
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Well, there's some information that's out now about Bionic Commando Re-Armed,

701
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:08,100
which is the 2D-style Bionic Commando that they're coming out with.

702
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,100
The title is supposed to be out in May,

703
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,100
and it will be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade for $10, American.

704
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,100
And there will be a PC version, but they don't have a price on it yet.

705
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,100
But the Xbox Live version is going to actually be for 800 Microsoft points.

706
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,100
The PlayStation Network one is $10.

707
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:40,100
And that it will, for the PC version anyway, it will require Windows XP or Vista.

708
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
I'm so sorry.

709
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:49,100
At least 512 megabytes of RAM and 650 megabytes of hard drive space.

710
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:55,100
And it may or may not have unique content.

711
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
It may or may not.

712
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,100
Well, thank you for covering the full spectrum of possibilities.

713
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
This game may or may not be good.

714
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
I have more information.

715
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:11,100
The minimum specs on this is XP Service Pack 2 or Vista.

716
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,100
I have a Pentium 4 2 gigahertz or an AMD XP 2200.

717
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,100
512 megabytes of RAM, 650 megabytes of hard drive space.

718
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:27,100
128 megabyte DirectX 9C compatible card or NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or ATI equivalent.

719
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,100
DirectX 9 compatible sound card, internet connection, keyboard, mouse.

720
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Their recommended ones are actually quite a bit better.

721
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:39,100
But, you know, honestly, why?

722
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
Okay.

723
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,100
I guess there's like, you can download minimum content

724
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,100
or you can have like the maximum content that's saying you want 2 gigs of hard drive space.

725
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,100
I think it's just the minimum requirements versus the maximum.

726
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,100
You can either install the entire game off the DVD

727
00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:00,100
or you could just run it off the DVD and some of it on the hard drive.

728
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Whatever.

729
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
So, it's kind of interesting though.

730
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:10,100
There's been some stuff leaked out from the German ratings board, the USK.

731
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,100
Of course, they had leaked out some stuff a while back

732
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:18,100
including the translation of Catan and Casarone to Xbox Live Arcade.

733
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Well, now they have another board game turned Xbox Live Arcade.

734
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
Did you mean Carcassonne?

735
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
Carcassonne, whatever.

736
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,100
You said it like casserole.

737
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Carcassonne.

738
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Whatever.

739
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
I had to, sorry.

740
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,100
Yeah.

741
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,100
Okay, you finished?

742
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
I'm done.

743
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
I promise.

744
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Anyways, one of the games that they had on there was Ticket to Ride

745
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,100
which, if you've played it, it's a train-themed game.

746
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,100
Also pretty fun.

747
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Some other games that they've also were revealed on there.

748
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Of course, Penny Arcade's games on the rain, Slick Precipice of Darkness.

749
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Rugu and Golf, tee it up.

750
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,100
And at least, we don't know when they're coming, but at least they're on their way.

751
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
What are you giggling at?

752
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:14,100
The Rob D in chat says, I'm going to go play that Super Mario goulash game next.

753
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
Whatever.

754
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Chat room's funny.

755
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
I love chat room.

756
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
Chat.orangelandradio.com.

757
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Yeah, chat's just perfect.

758
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,100
I love chat.

759
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:29,100
I also love more Xbox Live Arcade games as long as they don't suck, but hey, it might

760
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
be kind of cool.

761
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:37,100
Fable 2 is going to be interacting with apparently three different Xbox Live Arcade games.

762
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:43,100
That was recently revealed this week in an interview with the guy behind Fable 2, and

763
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,700
money that is won in one of the games can actually be transferred to funds in Fable

764
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,700
2.

765
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
We already knew that.

766
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,980
But Carbonated Games has made apparently some casual games, and there's three titles involved.

767
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,040
One is called Keystone, one is called Wizard's Tower, and the other one is called Mage Dice.

768
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,780
So when you play these games, which involve a little bit of gambling in them, you get

769
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,660
Fable Gold in them, and you get to use that Fable Gold in your Fable game.

770
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,740
I'm just looking forward to co-op in this game.

771
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,660
You know you can't wait for co-op in Fable 2, Loki.

772
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,340
Yeah, the only bad thing about Wizard's Tower is it's really just Yaris renamed Wizard's

773
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,340
Tower.

774
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,340
Shut up, really?

775
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
No.

776
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,340
Oh, I was going to say, that's horrible, if so.

777
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,020
I wonder if these are going to be free, because they are kind of like, you know, marketing

778
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
Fable 2.

779
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,020
No.

780
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,020
Hopefully they're cheap.

781
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
They better not be expensive.

782
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,300
They're going to whore this game out like a whore.

783
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,460
Basically achievements in the game, a Fable by the way, achievement points are going to

784
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,540
be tied to the game's morality scale.

785
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:48,060
So basically achievements, you know, would be being pure, pure good and pure, pure bad

786
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
could be interesting.

787
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:55,300
Well duh, they're going to of course have stuff like that as well as like, I don't know,

788
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,580
kill your dog, I don't know.

789
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:02,100
But at the same time, like, the original Fable sounded so freaking awesome and then it was

790
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,660
kind of, it was okay, it was okay.

791
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,660
But I'm definitely interested in checking this game out, so we'll see.

792
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:16,820
Well, you know, there's another game that I think is, well okay, I'd never played it,

793
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,180
but I know a lot of people did, Puzzle Quest.

794
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,740
Well, Puzzle Quest, you know, is doing pretty well on Xbox Live Arcade, so there's actually

795
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:35,440
going to be a expansion and they're asking the players to name it for them.

796
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:43,580
Sort of like a, if you actually go onto the contest website, which is at puzzle-quest.com,

797
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,580
ooh, actually it's already over.

798
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
It ended on the 21st.

799
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,580
Dang, that went by fast.

800
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,520
It wasn't even open when I last checked earlier this week.

801
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,260
It ended on the 21st.

802
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,700
Well damn, I was going to try to get our chatters to spam them with Puzzle Quest Orange or something.

803
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,700
Not really.

804
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,420
Well, at any rate, they said that once they've decided the name, then the expansion's going

805
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,080
to be out in the spring over Xbox Live.

806
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,780
So have fun.

807
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,140
But what about all the other places they hoard Puzzle Quest to?

808
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,500
They just get shafted, huh?

809
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
I have no idea.

810
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,660
I would have never thought Puzzle Quest was going to get an expansion or any type of microtransactions

811
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,220
whatsoever because of the fact it was on the DS and all these other systems.

812
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,580
So I'm kind of surprised at this news.

813
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
So it's just interesting.

814
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,820
I don't know how else to explain it.

815
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
Interesting.

816
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
I wasn't expecting that.

817
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
Were you expecting an expansion?

818
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
I sure wasn't.

819
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,820
An expansion?

820
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,700
No, because I thought they would just hoard that out in Puzzle Quest II or something like

821
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
that.

822
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:44,080
But I guess something to kill time until Puzzle Quest Galactics comes out or Galactrix

823
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,220
or whatever the fuck they're calling it.

824
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,220
The I-can't-believe-it's-not-puzzle-quest?

825
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,220
Yes.

826
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,220
Gotcha.

827
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:57,180
Alright, so this weekend there's been a whole bunch of drama revolving a supposedly leaked

828
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:04,060
game Sonic Unleashed with tons of screenshots out there available for it.

829
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,060
People are wondering is this an actual game that got leaked?

830
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,420
Is this an April Fool's joke?

831
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,420
Who knows?

832
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,900
Well, first it started off, eh, it's probably fake, you know, who knows?

833
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,600
But then there's like a hundred some screenshots for this.

834
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,580
So I don't know if it is fake, it's one of the most elaborate fakes I've ever seen.

835
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:30,620
But then apparently now there was news that, you know, Sega of Europe said that it is official

836
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:36,300
and that they were going to be announcing it during their May gamer's day and also make

837
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,280
an official announcement at E3.

838
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,100
But then there are some sort of, you know, kind of wishy-washy stuff going on with that

839
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,780
and now it's maybe not real again.

840
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,200
I think at this point it's safe to say with the video out there, with the screenshots

841
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,220
out there, I would say it's real.

842
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,860
I don't see how it can be a fake at this point based off that video because that video is

843
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,860
pretty kick-ass which is out there on YouTube somewhere, right?

844
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,820
You have to check out the video of this game, it looks like finally they got the right idea

845
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,820
with Sonic.

846
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,220
It's basically like a Sonic 2.5D as they would call it.

847
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,980
It's very much like the traditional Sonic game, looks pretty good.

848
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,820
The screenshots that they've been showing were supposedly from an Xbox 360 version.

849
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,660
There's some other rumors coming out that the game is going to be on the cover of next

850
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:30,380
month's Play Magazine and also that there's going to be some stuff running the official

851
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:37,960
Nintendo magazine, the UK one, that's going to be, I guess, the cover in August for them.

852
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,940
So right now we're speculating that it's coming out for the 360 and probably a version for

853
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,220
the Wii and you can probably assume that there's a version for the PS3 if there's one coming

854
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,340
out for the 360.

855
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,420
ActDeft in chat says, hope for Sonic's future equals rising.

856
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,660
I really hope so because the last few Sonic creations in a row minus his appearance in

857
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,760
Brawl have all been very disappointing.

858
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,580
So God, I hope so.

859
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,580
Don't you hope, Jamie?

860
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,980
I hope they got it right finally.

861
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,980
I can hope.

862
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,940
The screenshots are pretty awesome.

863
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,300
I watched the movie file, it's pretty sweet.

864
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:20,140
I think, like I said, if it was a hoax, then the hoax game needs to come out, honestly.

865
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:26,780
That is one hell of an elaborate hoax to fake, I don't know how many screenshots of this

866
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,780
game.

867
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,100
Or even a mapped level.

868
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,940
The video followed the level all the way through.

869
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,020
It's very unlikely that it would be an April Fool's joke, but hey, you know what, credit

870
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,300
to them if it is an April Fool's joke because that's one of the most convincing April Fool's

871
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,380
jokes I've ever seen.

872
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:52,140
Another convincing April Fool's joke was the rumor about Wario's Woods coming to WiiWare.

873
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,300
Some screenshots came out earlier this week that appeared to show a version of Wario's

874
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,300
Woods on the Wii.

875
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,020
I'll tell you what, these are damn good screenshots.

876
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
Look at that.

877
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,100
That is pretty convincing.

878
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:07,580
This whole, it has a more 3D-ish look to them and it shows the Wii remote and some little

879
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,300
text in Japanese, I would have bought this, but guess what, it was a joke.

880
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,740
And some of our listeners may not even know this, you may have just saw the news earlier

881
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,360
this week, but yes, it came out Go Nintendo ran a report with a video from the guy who

882
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,820
actually created the whole thing and he kind of shows how he did it.

883
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,860
It was actually meant to be an April Fool's joke and apparently what happened is that

884
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,700
he posted the joke in IRC trying to get some feedback from some of the folks in IRC like,

885
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
hey, is this believable?

886
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:39,060
Well, some of the folks in IRC like sent it to Joystiq and it got out there a little bit

887
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
early.

888
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,060
Whoops!

889
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,500
So, unfortunately, it is fake.

890
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,020
Wario's Woods not coming to WiiWare.

891
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,580
At least this one, I mean, but then again, you never know what Nintendo might have up

892
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,900
their sleeve.

893
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:56,020
It may not look like this, but as far as I'm concerned, whatever artist did these did a

894
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:00,140
pretty darn good job and Nintendo maybe ought to think to talking to this guy.

895
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,340
Maybe they ought to cook something like this up.

896
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,220
So we'll see.

897
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,260
But sadly, no Wario's Woods on WiiWare anytime soon.

898
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,860
That's poopy.

899
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,260
Unless Nintendo's getting the last laugh, who knows?

900
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:22,420
Well, something that came out in the April issue of UK's official Xbox magazine said

901
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:29,460
that Ikaruga was out now and was getting a 9 out of 10 from the magazine with no actual

902
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,020
release date.

903
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:37,020
So you know what?

904
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,020
Is this real?

905
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,180
Oh, what, another April Fool's joke?

906
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,420
Probably.

907
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,420
Who knows?

908
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
Ikaruga?

909
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,140
Well, I mean, it came out in the April issue.

910
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,980
No, I think that is.

911
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:54,220
It was a piece talking about Ikaruga and usually in the corner it'll say release date, you

912
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,860
know, March or whatever, and it says release out now because it's the April issue.

913
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,860
So this hasn't...

914
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,940
Well, the game is coming.

915
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,540
We've had a story on this before, yeah.

916
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,540
The game is coming.

917
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
That's not...

918
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,540
Just for a moment when you were talking about April Fool's Day, I was like, wait, they better

919
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,980
not be taunting me with Ikaruga.

920
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,620
God, I hate April Fool's Day.

921
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,620
I know.

922
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,580
I mean, seriously, it's going to be like this for the next two weeks.

923
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,780
Well, they did have it out at the Tokyo Game Show.

924
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,500
I just wasn't thinking that it was out quite yet.

925
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:25,460
But Ikaruga is like one of the best shooter games ever, so that's really cool.

926
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,460
And it's Treasure.

927
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,460
GS68 in chat says, game publications should be banned from making April issues anymore.

928
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,660
I kind of agree.

929
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,660
I kind of agree.

930
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,660
Maybe it's just me.

931
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:40,720
Well, if I were a game publication, I would just flat out, you know, post a little editorial

932
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:47,560
in my magazine saying, while certain other magazines and, you know, publications may

933
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,780
want to, you know, joke about April Fool's and stuff like that, I would just say, you

934
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,900
know, we don't do that, and we figure that you would appreciate more accurate coverage

935
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,740
than something that may confuse you, I don't know.

936
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:07,260
Which is, you know, I think the kind of stance we take on this show, you know.

937
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,260
April Fool's is...

938
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,260
Usually our jokes are pretty obvious.

939
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,260
Yeah.

940
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,780
And I don't think we're going to do one this year now in light of the other news that came

941
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,200
out, so we'll see.

942
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:22,280
The joke is we're going to stay on Live 365.

943
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,740
So moving on with more news then, Loki.

944
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:31,940
Well, we don't like to talk about him too much, but there was a brand new story this

945
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:38,240
week about our friend Jackie Poo, or Voldemort, as you may know him.

946
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:48,620
The Florida Supreme Court has sent an official notice to Jack Thompson that he now must have

947
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:54,700
an attorney to basically approve any further cases he has.

948
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:59,300
The court's ruling is basically saying that the numerous abuses that Thompson had made,

949
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,740
including submitting pornography and stuff like that, is a relentless and frivolous pursuit

950
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:09,220
for vindication of his claim that he is being victimized by the Florida Bar, and the continued

951
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:14,300
ability to maintain the minimum standard of decorum and respect for the judicial system

952
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,100
in which the litigants, and especially the attorneys, must adhere, because of this basically

953
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:27,740
the motion has been made that for any lawsuit that he is now putting forward, it must be

954
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:33,460
signed off by, I guess, an accredited attorney or something like that.

955
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,220
In other words, he needs a babysitter.

956
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,220
Yes.

957
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,180
So it's interesting.

958
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,060
I don't know.

959
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,960
Hopefully we'll see a lot less of him unless he gets some other retarded person to kind

960
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:52,620
of help him along and kind of join forces with him.

961
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,460
I think it's about damn time.

962
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:03,340
To Lord Voldemort from your friends at Orange Lounge Radio, you probably couldn't hear that

963
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,340
again.

964
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,340
Let's try this one instead.

965
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,340
Hold on.

966
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,340
That's wonderful.

967
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:15,940
No, and here's the best part about the whole thing.

968
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:23,140
After this ruling came down, apparently Thompson sent out an email describing the Supreme Court's

969
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:31,940
order as both good news and idiotic, because he's got them right where he wants them now.

970
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:38,700
Does he live on another planet?

971
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:44,060
Speaking of crazy stuff, there's that new Street Fighter movie coming out, Street Fighter

972
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,780
The Legend of Chun-Li, and it's getting a more full cast.

973
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,100
Chris Klein is in it.

974
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,260
He plays Guile's friend, which apparently is a big role.

975
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,260
I don't know.

976
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,260
Charlie.

977
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,260
Right.

978
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,260
Charlie Nash.

979
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:06,580
Kristen Kreuk, who is the Lois Lane on Smallville.

980
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,580
She's playing...

981
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,020
No, I guess it would be Lana Lane, because it was a daughter, right?

982
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,020
I don't know.

983
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,020
I don't watch Smallville.

984
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,020
That's her.

985
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,020
Whatever.

986
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,020
She's going to be Chun-Li.

987
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,940
I bet half the guys who watch her don't even know what her name is.

988
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,000
They just watch her.

989
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,460
She's going to be Chun-Li, and Michael Clarke Duncan is going to be Balrog.

990
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,460
Get this.

991
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,460
Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas is going to be Vega.

992
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,540
He's the guy with the long hair and the black eyed peas.

993
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,900
He's going to be Vega.

994
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,780
That's going to be interesting.

995
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,460
Neil McDonough is going to be M. Bison.

996
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:41,100
And I've never really heard that name, but then when I see his picture, I'm like, okay,

997
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,100
that guy.

998
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,040
I think I've seen him before, somewhere.

999
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,580
And I agree with SSJ100Matt in chat who says, this movie fails for one reason.

1000
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,580
No Kylie.

1001
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,060
And I kind of agree.

1002
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,980
Oh, this guy was in Star Trek First Contact.

1003
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,980
That's why he looks familiar.

1004
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,340
Minority Report.

1005
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,340
Band of Brothers.

1006
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,340
Okay.

1007
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,340
He's been hand fulfilled.

1008
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,300
You know why this movie also fails?

1009
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,300
Uh oh.

1010
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,300
Why?

1011
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,780
Because it's a Street Fighter movie and anybody that thinks of Street Fighter the movie is

1012
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,580
always going to think of the last horrible Street Fighter movie.

1013
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,220
Okay, I just killed...

1014
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,220
I just...

1015
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,220
Horrell Julia.

1016
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:23,900
I just realized why this guy looks so familiar to me, but I almost don't want to say why.

1017
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:32,160
And it's because of one of the movies he was recently in was the last movie I saw on DVD.

1018
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,660
It was I Know Who Killed Me.

1019
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,300
I actually watched that on DVD and he was in it.

1020
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,300
Because I have to see...

1021
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,560
Okay, when a film wins the award for worst movie of the year, I have to see just how

1022
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,860
bad it is.

1023
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:46,860
And it was pretty bad.

1024
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,860
No you don't.

1025
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,660
I'm going to give you fair warning that it sucks.

1026
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,660
So why do you...

1027
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,660
I like that movie.

1028
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,660
I love Showgirls.

1029
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,080
Showgirls is one of my favorite movies of all time, but it's one of those things where

1030
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,900
it's so bad it's good.

1031
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,900
Get it?

1032
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,980
Like, we actually had a discussion about this at our friend's house the other day.

1033
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,460
And the movie actually came up as Caveman.

1034
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,460
Have you seen that movie?

1035
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,460
No.

1036
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,380
It was really, really not a good movie and it was one of the 70s and the dinosaurs in

1037
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,380
it were all claymation.

1038
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,380
Nice.

1039
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,060
But it was so awful that it's a great movie.

1040
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,860
Nice.

1041
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,660
I've seen Teenage Caveman.

1042
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,260
That was like Mystery Science Theater 3000.

1043
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,180
Manos, The Hands of Fate.

1044
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,140
Alright, can we please move on?

1045
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,780
Yeah.

1046
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,260
I have some stuff.

1047
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:43,280
So I don't know how I feel about this because, you know, again with all of the movies coming

1048
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:51,620
out from, you know, video games, and especially since the horrible, horrible Ooey bowl is

1049
00:50:51,620 --> 00:51:00,540
associated with this one, The Name of the King, A Dungeon Siege Tale is going to be

1050
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,340
out on April 15th.

1051
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,580
You know, I knew this like a long time ago and I wish I had thought about this, but I

1052
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:09,260
figured it was an Ooey bowl movie and no one really cares.

1053
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:17,060
It will have deleted scenes, behind the scenes featurette, and trailers.

1054
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:26,180
And the suggested retail is $27.98, so look for it in the $5 bin at Walmart in a few weeks

1055
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,180
after that.

1056
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:32,220
Has anyone, I don't know if anyone else saw the news this week.

1057
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:39,460
They're running a website for Postal, the movie, because it's launching the same weekend

1058
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:49,660
as Indiana Jones, and they have Vern Troyer dressed up like Indy and it was like, I don't

1059
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:55,980
remember what the phrase was, it was something stupid like, you know, I have a message for

1060
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,720
Indy fuck you, or like fuck you up or something like that, I don't know.

1061
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,300
But they literally, I think, I'm sure it's supposed to be parody, but half of me still

1062
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,180
thinks that they literally think that they're going to beat Indiana Jones in the box office

1063
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,180
somehow.

1064
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,180
Delusional.

1065
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,180
Exactly.

1066
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:20,180
You know what's going to happen when they go back to work Monday morning after that

1067
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,940
weekend?

1068
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,900
Vern Troyer is going to go drink some more.

1069
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:33,620
No, he's about as delusional as Jack Thompson.

1070
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:37,500
It's basically just going to be, you know, he's going to think it's a great victory for

1071
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,180
him and that, you know, it may make him the most money out of any of his movies or some

1072
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,300
shit like that, and he'll have renewed hope for making more video game movies or something.

1073
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,300
I don't know.

1074
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,740
I kind of miss when this show had a soundboard.

1075
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,580
I think in our post-live 365 era, we need to bring back the soundboard.

1076
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,580
I kind of miss having one.

1077
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,580
Yeah.

1078
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,580
Okay.

1079
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,580
Sorry.

1080
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:07,280
So, Call of Duty 4, a very successful game, they are going to be getting a brand new Game

1081
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:14,100
of the Year edition, which is going to be coming out in April, actually April 3rd for

1082
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,780
the Xbox 360 version.

1083
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:21,740
Along with that, there will be a brand new map pack that's going to have a few different

1084
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:28,820
maps of Creek, Broadcast, Chinatown, and Kill House, that's going to be available for $10,

1085
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:32,980
and as you might guess, in the Game of the Year edition, you get a token to download

1086
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:37,020
that for free, so if you haven't bought the game yet and are thinking about it, you may

1087
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,940
wait for this one to come out.

1088
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:45,100
It should be noted, though, that for some reason whatsoever, the PlayStation 3 version's

1089
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,180
coming out a few weeks after the Xbox 360 one.

1090
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:56,180
I don't get that, but that's going on, so hooray.

1091
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,100
Hooray?

1092
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,580
I guess.

1093
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,420
Also hooray for this, I like the store Target, and Target is apparently getting into gaming

1094
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,180
in a way you may not have guessed.

1095
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,620
They are selling indie gaming shirts.

1096
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:17,060
They're selling shirts from independent games like Tower of Goo and some other games that

1097
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,820
are there, and the shirts only cost you $12, here's the best part, buy the shirt, get the

1098
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,020
game with it.

1099
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,460
They actually have the game, like I can see in this little picture, the game's actually

1100
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:29,240
kind of hanging around the collar of the shirt, so you can get both for $12.

1101
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,240
That's cool.

1102
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,240
That's kind of a neat little concept.

1103
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,240
That is really cool.

1104
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,980
That is strange to see at Target, though, of all places.

1105
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,260
I would not have expected this to be at Target.

1106
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,580
EGP Apparel.

1107
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,460
I would expect to see that maybe at GameStop or something.

1108
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:49,260
Yeah, or some other type of nerd store like Hot Topic, it's kind of nerdy, right?

1109
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,140
EGPapparel.com if you want to see more about that.

1110
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,900
Buy the shirt and get the game for free.

1111
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,900
That's cool.

1112
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,260
That's very interesting.

1113
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,540
Tower of Goo sounds funny.

1114
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,180
MacMan in chat says Target and Kmart.

1115
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,840
Tower of Goo is coming to the WiiWare also.

1116
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,840
You know what I didn't realize?

1117
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:11,460
I did not realize until just last week that Defend Your Castle game that's coming to the

1118
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,460
Wii.

1119
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,460
I did not realize that it's based off the old Flash game where you throw the guys up

1120
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:20,460
in the air and watch them explode into millions of pieces, because I saw the preview for that

1121
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,860
somewhere earlier this week, and when I watched it, I'm like, oh, shit, that game.

1122
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:29,100
That would be hella fun in multiplayer mode.

1123
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,100
That Defend Your Castle game.

1124
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,340
Especially when you're drunk and you're just like, ah.

1125
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,340
That game is fun.

1126
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:36,100
What's the site that you can play that game for free on?

1127
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:41,060
I don't know, but they had it linked, I know, on the Joystick story for that when they were

1128
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,860
talking about.

1129
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,620
But I'm sure if you type in Defend Your Castle, you probably can find it.

1130
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:50,180
XGenStudios.com slash play slash castle.

1131
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,780
That game is so much fun, even though it's like years old.

1132
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,700
I think it's been on the internet for like three years.

1133
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,260
Let me post that in chat there so our lovely chatters can take a look at that game.

1134
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,260
But don't get too distracted, because it's time for us to open up the Skype line.

1135
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,260
That's right.

1136
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,920
It's the part of the show where we let you guys interact with us if you want to give

1137
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,100
us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1138
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,740
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1139
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:15,300
This is the part of the show where you can do that and interact with us, and we'll be

1140
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:21,780
taking calls I'd say right about right now, at least when they start coming in.

1141
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,740
So in the meantime, we ought to go to Loki for some last-minute stories, yes, Loki?

1142
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:27,740
Yes.

1143
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:31,800
Okay, so to start things off, let's see.

1144
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,320
We've got some kind of terrible news, actually.

1145
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,500
There's rumors that the latest Wii update blocks the freeloader from working.

1146
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,500
Yes, that's right.

1147
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:48,920
The brand new freeloader that apparently was supposed to be unfazed by Wii updates, apparently

1148
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,460
that's been broken.

1149
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,380
Although we're getting mixed, or I should say Go Nintendo has been getting mixed emails

1150
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,380
about it.

1151
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,260
Some people are saying that it is not working.

1152
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,060
Some people are saying it is still working.

1153
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:07,620
But the real update that was supposed to be for that is it's actually supposed to be defeating

1154
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:11,180
a different homebrew kind of hack thing that they had going on.

1155
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,700
I told you it would take like 15 seconds for Nintendo to patch that show.

1156
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:19,140
No, it's not the one you're thinking, too, it's this thing called a Trecha Assigner.

1157
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:24,460
It basically allows them to create, because all the files on Wii discs are encrypted,

1158
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,900
so this will allow you to create the key and basically put your own files, make your own

1159
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,260
homebrew discs for the Wii, basically.

1160
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,260
Let's go to the phones.

1161
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,260
I've got somebody on hold.

1162
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,260
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1163
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,260
Who's this?

1164
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,260
Yeah, what's up?

1165
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,260
This is RossDioUT.

1166
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,260
Hello.

1167
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,260
Wow.

1168
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,260
You're really good at getting through first.

1169
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,260
You're like the new Raven's Dolphin.

1170
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,660
Whatever happened to Raven's Dolphin?

1171
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,700
Did he abandon our show?

1172
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,140
Raven's Dolphin, where are you?

1173
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,140
I miss you.

1174
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,140
Okay, I'm sorry.

1175
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,140
RossDioUT, you're cool, too.

1176
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,140
What's up?

1177
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,140
Okay.

1178
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:59,180
First off, I'm surprised you didn't mention this early on in the show when you were talking

1179
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:07,140
about the Gibson lawsuit bonanza, but here's a link that talks about the patent.

1180
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:11,660
I'm going to put it in the chat right now.

1181
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:20,180
Basically what's happening is that the diagram that goes with the patent shows a stereoscopic

1182
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:30,580
headset, an eight-channel mixer, a FEX processor, among other crazy-ass shit, and an actual

1183
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:31,580
musical instrument.

1184
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,060
I don't know if you can see the picture from that link.

1185
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,940
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

1186
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:41,380
Yeah, I didn't want to spend too much time on that whole Gibson lawsuit because I think

1187
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,380
it's retarded.

1188
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,180
I was going to get to that actually in a few seconds.

1189
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,620
What do you want to say then, Libby?

1190
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,940
Well, basically here's what Harmonix's response to the Gibson lawsuit was.

1191
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:54,780
This lawsuit is completely without merit and we intend to defend it vigorously.

1192
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:59,300
Gibson's patent filed nearly 10 years ago required a 3D display, a real musical instrument,

1193
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,780
and a recording of a concert.

1194
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,460
Rock band and guitar hero are completely different.

1195
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:09,400
Among other things, they are games, require no headset, and use a controller only shaped

1196
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,400
like a real instrument.

1197
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,900
It's unfortunate Gibson unfairly desires to share the tremendous success enjoyed by the

1198
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,260
developers of rock band and guitar hero.

1199
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:20,820
Yeah, looking at this little picture of the guitar, I mean, I know pictures and patents

1200
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:25,100
aren't supposed to be the end all be all because we've seen others throughout the years, but

1201
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,820
this looks nothing like the game controller that they're using.

1202
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,820
It looks like a MIDI guitar.

1203
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:38,340
Yeah, I mean, it looks so far removed from guitar hero and rock band, I don't even see

1204
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,860
where Gibson's coming from.

1205
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:47,220
They're not going to win this, that's for sure, because it's not even close.

1206
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:51,860
Not even, not even, and I'm shocked seeing it that they'd even bother.

1207
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,700
But then again, we've seen more stupid lawsuits before.

1208
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:59,700
Oh yes, there was one other thing.

1209
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:05,660
Rainbow Six Vegas 2 came out last week, and if anybody's listening is thinking about getting

1210
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:09,820
it, I would stay away from the PS3 one if you're interested in online, because the online

1211
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:10,820
is broken.

1212
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:15,220
Oh great, what's broken about it?

1213
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:25,460
Well, I'm finding myself unable to get into most games, and the few games that I can get

1214
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,260
into, I get booted off right away, and it's not just me.

1215
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:33,140
In those few games, I've talked to the people there and they're having the same problem.

1216
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:37,020
I know it's not me because I'm not having the problem with Vegas 1, I'm not having a

1217
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:42,360
problem with a lot of the other PS3 games, Call of Duty 4 and stuff, but I was actually

1218
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:49,820
rather shocked, especially since the game had a release day patch.

1219
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,420
Don't worry, a patch will fix it.

1220
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:58,300
That seems to be the thinking of video games in this day and age.

1221
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,980
The patch that came out when the game came out, I'm serious, I pre-ordered the game,

1222
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,520
I got it first day, right?

1223
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:11,580
And I go home, literally, immediately, PlayStation Network's like, yeah, we got a patch, download

1224
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,380
it, and I was like, alright.

1225
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,940
I figured it was a multiplayer patch, but apparently not.

1226
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,140
Patches should be for what Rock Band just did.

1227
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:23,780
It added a whole new feature to the thing that maybe should have been there in the first

1228
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,780
place, but oh well, it was a new feature, something new and neat.

1229
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,820
That is an acceptable patch to me.

1230
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:34,640
An unacceptable patch to me is, oh, I don't know, Bully?

1231
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,020
Or countless others?

1232
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,740
Yeah, that's another one.

1233
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:44,860
Another thing is, this isn't the first time we've seen an Ubisoft game with a patch to

1234
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,900
fix things that were either broken or they were too lazy to get in.

1235
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:53,260
I don't know if you guys remember Naruto, Rise of a Ninja?

1236
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,580
Like a week after the game came out, they came out with a Japanese language patch.

1237
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:00,280
It is literally 52 megs.

1238
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,220
They're basically unlocking it off the disk.

1239
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,220
It's just ridiculous.

1240
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,900
I don't know, 52 megs doesn't sound like a key.

1241
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,180
Usually a key is pretty small.

1242
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:13,980
52 megs, that sounds like actual dialogue to me.

1243
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,340
There's no possible way.

1244
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:20,780
It's all the voices in the town and the cutscenes.

1245
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,260
There's a lot more than 52 megs worth of dialogue going on there.

1246
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,260
It's all voices.

1247
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:31,660
I don't know how that could be all the dialogue.

1248
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:36,660
It's just too much.

1249
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:41,240
We don't see it as much as we did when the 360 came out.

1250
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,500
I think companies are getting better about it.

1251
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:52,900
But we're still seeing this sort of, ah, fuck it, rush it out, we'll patch it attitude.

1252
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:59,380
It's going to start hurting companies, especially with these consoles getting more popular because

1253
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,820
you know the majority of them aren't going to be online.

1254
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:07,900
It's just a numbers game.

1255
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:11,380
I really feel sorry for the people who are going to get stuck with unpatched versions,

1256
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:15,500
especially with what Rob mentioned, Bully.

1257
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,500
That's going to suck.

1258
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,980
Well, Ross, we've got to wrap up so you can go, but any other quick thoughts you want

1259
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,980
to get out there?

1260
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,300
Actually, no.

1261
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:33,820
I mean, that's pretty much it, except for the whole Ubisoft buying Tom Clancy thing.

1262
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:38,620
The only thing I was surprised was that they hadn't already done it.

1263
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:42,620
I would have thought that was already a relationship that was, but there you have it.

1264
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:45,380
All right, Ross, have a good one, buddy.

1265
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,380
You too, Sam.

1266
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,380
Bye bye.

1267
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:51,260
All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

1268
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,140
Orange Lounge Radio.

1269
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:00,420
Any other stories you want to share with us, Loki, while we're waiting?

1270
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,420
Sure.

1271
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,980
There's apparently some pretty cool mods.

1272
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:03,980
Oh, never mind.

1273
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:04,980
We've got to call.

1274
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:05,980
Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.

1275
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:06,980
Who's this?

1276
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:07,980
Hey, what's up?

1277
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:08,980
It's the RobD guys.

1278
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:09,980
Well, hello.

1279
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:10,980
Long time, no talk.

1280
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:11,980
RobD.

1281
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:12,980
Hi.

1282
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:13,980
How are you?

1283
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,980
Yeah, yeah.

1284
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,180
I've kind of been working and all that fun stuff.

1285
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,780
I work most Sundays and I close, so that kind of disables me from actually listening to

1286
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,780
you guys.

1287
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,780
Work?

1288
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,420
What is this work thing you speak of?

1289
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,820
Yeah, I know.

1290
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,860
I need to actually abandon my job and only play games for a living.

1291
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,860
Exactly.

1292
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,860
See how that one goes for a little while.

1293
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:35,860
Exactly.

1294
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,860
All right.

1295
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:37,860
Well, what's on your mind tonight, Rob?

1296
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:43,300
Well, I've got to say, actually, just listening to Ross steal UTT's call, now that Ubisoft

1297
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:48,020
actually owns a Tom Clancy license, we're going to see Tom Clancy's, I don't know,

1298
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:53,260
Tom Clancy's Nautilus or Rise of a Ninja or Tom Clancy's Enchanted Arms now that they

1299
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,700
actually own the property.

1300
01:04:54,700 --> 01:05:00,860
I somehow doubt that would happen, but usually, that's kind of like the same thing with

1301
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:05,600
the whole, when Activision bought Blizzard or whatever, the whole World of Warcraft will

1302
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,500
come to Guitar Hero tomorrow.

1303
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:15,460
That'd be great, but I got to say, the reason I called in is I don't really have a topic

1304
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:19,740
to discuss, but I need to just express my joy as a fighting game fan of just the titles

1305
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:23,340
coming out this year, because you've got King of Fighters XII, you've got Super Smash

1306
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:28,080
Brothers Brawl, Street Fighter IV, Super Street Fighter II HD Remix, Soul Calibur IV.

1307
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,540
I can't remember a crop of fighting games, well, at least-

1308
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,540
Tekken 6?

1309
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:35,780
At the very least, with this pedigree, yeah, exactly, with this pedigree for a very long

1310
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:36,780
time.

1311
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,220
We'll see if all these games end up panning out to be good.

1312
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:43,500
That obviously remains to be seen, but as a fighting game fan, I just haven't been

1313
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,100
this excited for games, especially to see some of these franchises go multiplayer, well,

1314
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,420
with online multiplayer for the very first time.

1315
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:55,220
Hopefully we'll see that out of several franchises this year, especially good multiplayer out

1316
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,220
of Street Fighter.

1317
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,220
That'd be-

1318
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,220
That's a good point.

1319
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,500
I can't think of a year that has been quite as big for fighting games as this year is

1320
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,500
shaping up to be.

1321
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,220
I haven't really had it put in perspective for me like that, but yeah, that's a lot

1322
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,380
of big-ass franchises all coming back.

1323
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,180
I think the only big franchise I can think of that's missing is Mortal Kombat, and

1324
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:16,620
most would say that franchise peaked quite some time ago, so whatever, but that's

1325
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,620
kind of interesting.

1326
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:20,860
I still gave some screenshots for the other day for King of Fighters XII, and it looks

1327
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,900
pretty hot, I got to say.

1328
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:23,900
Not that I've been-

1329
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:27,260
Yeah, they read you all the animations for all that, so I'm looking forward to seeing

1330
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,820
how they'll actually turn out.

1331
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:34,980
Trucker Terry's back, so for all the Terry Bogard, Engrish, hey, come on, come on, fans,

1332
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,940
that should make many of them pleased.

1333
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,940
Nice.

1334
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:41,880
Speaking of old school fighting games from SNK, you know how your pick, your classic

1335
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,820
game of the week last week was The Last Blade.

1336
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:48,700
They have it on GameTap 1 and 2, so I went and played it for a little bit, just because

1337
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,300
I had never really played it before.

1338
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,260
It's fun, although I was using a keyboard, and fighting games with keyboards are always

1339
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,260
kind of wonky.

1340
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:58,060
You've got to really use a joystick, but eh, I had fun while I was playing.

1341
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,620
I think it's a really stylish game.

1342
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,340
Yeah, it's definitely stylish.

1343
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,820
I couldn't figure out any of the fatalities, though.

1344
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,180
That was the part I was looking forward to doing, but anyway, sorry, I didn't mean

1345
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:11,540
to derail, but what do you think about the whole Street Fighter IV?

1346
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:15,820
Do you think it's shaping up to be pretty awesome, or is it just like Street Fighter

1347
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,700
II ten years later, or what do you think?

1348
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,580
Well it's nice to see that they're actually modernizing the look, and I think this is

1349
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:27,580
an important step for the franchise, that they're moving finally from sprites to, you

1350
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:32,140
know, some modern graphics that aren't done by, what was that company that did Street

1351
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,260
Fighter EX?

1352
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,060
I think Akira or something like that?

1353
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,060
I don't even remember, frankly.

1354
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:43,060
To me, it all depends on how the game plays, you can't really determine until the game

1355
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,060
actually comes out.

1356
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,020
I think it's going to be disappointing if the game doesn't really come out with anything

1357
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:52,140
particularly new in the fighting game engine, especially since SNK has been changing up

1358
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:56,620
their fighting game engine practically every year, and with King of Fighters XI, they really

1359
01:07:56,620 --> 01:08:00,580
broke out, pulled out all the stops with the super cancels, well not the super cancels,

1360
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:06,340
because that's been there for a while, but the dream cancels, the saving shifts, a lot

1361
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:12,980
of things that actually changed the gameplay, and just really helped it out as a franchise.

1362
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:16,860
I'd really like to see how the game plays, and considering I really doubt that it'll

1363
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:19,980
actually make any kind of a splash in American arcades, we'll probably have to wait until

1364
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:23,140
it comes out whenever it does.

1365
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:28,940
Do you think American arcades can be saved, Rob?

1366
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:35,100
Probably not, not with how online play has been just proliferated over here, and in Japan

1367
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:40,300
I don't think that's really as much of a concern, since they're not really into shooters

1368
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:45,340
as much as we are certainly, and they haven't had Xbox Live, or at least they don't support

1369
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:51,380
Xbox Live as much as we do, I really doubt you can get gamers that gathered again.

1370
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:56,180
So sad, because it was just not even, you can count how long ago it was when arcades

1371
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:01,020
were still, they might have been getting closer on its last legs, but this show started due

1372
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:05,860
to hanging out in an arcade, so this is kind of sad.

1373
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:10,300
I have fond memories of playing Neo Geo games and playing the old X in an arcade game, Turtles

1374
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,260
in Time especially was a favorite of mine, oh god.

1375
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:16,700
You can still play Neo Geo arcade, like they have a Neo Geo arcade machine at Jim Boy's

1376
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,700
Tacos, have you seen that?

1377
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,700
I don't eat at Jim Boy's.

1378
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:24,580
Oh, but well, okay, well, they have one there, it might be worth looking at.

1379
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:28,220
There's a bajillion Jim Boys around too, I don't know which one you mean.

1380
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:33,380
It's the one over on Folsom and Sunrise, I know that makes no sense to our other listeners,

1381
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,380
but anyway.

1382
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:40,940
Well, I used to go to Rico's Pizza, and play the DDR there while I was eating pizza, and

1383
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,140
18 Wheeler Pro Trekker.

1384
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,740
Yeah, remember when pizza parlors had hella arcade games in them, like it was like pizza

1385
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:52,620
slash arcade, and now you're lucky to go to a round table and see like two games and a

1386
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,980
pinball table, that's it.

1387
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:54,980
You're lucky to see that.

1388
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,220
Well, we were just talking about, just for the pinball aspect, we were talking, because

1389
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:02,380
I'm sure everyone by now knows that, you know, my husband and I collect pinball machines,

1390
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:07,580
no tables, but we were just talking about how you used to be able to go anywhere and

1391
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:13,080
there would always be a pinball, and some sort of classic game, and whatever was not

1392
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:19,140
exactly new new, but was new about three months ago, they're waiting, you know.

1393
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:24,100
And now it's like, no, we have crane games, sorry.

1394
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,100
That's sad.

1395
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:30,100
Yeah, the pizza parlor was where I first played Street Fighter II, so, and I actually, the

1396
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:34,580
first character I ever played as was Dalsim, or as my mom called him, Mr. Stretchy Arms,

1397
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:40,300
so I've always kind of had a soft spot in my heart for pizza parlor arcade games.

1398
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,580
My first Street Fighter II was at a 7-11.

1399
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:47,620
My first Street Fighter II was at a college arcade.

1400
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:52,060
My college arcade, I can still remember the lineup for the longest time.

1401
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:58,940
We had Cyber, not, what am I thinking of, I can't remember, Cyberstorm was it?

1402
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:06,420
It was like, it was sort of like a virtual on ripoff, sort of, and we had A Killer Instinct,

1403
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:12,740
we had World Cup Soccer 94, which became my favorite table and I own one now, we had Dark

1404
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:20,540
Stalkers, we had KOF 94, and a bunch of other machines that I usually ignored.

1405
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:26,340
SSJ100Matt says, yeah, I remember when 7-11s had arcade games here, and I was gonna say,

1406
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:30,020
it wasn't a 7-11, but the same type of thing, a little convenience store chain was one of

1407
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,140
the first places I played Mortal Kombat II.

1408
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:39,220
Well, 7-11 actually went out of business in Alabama a long time ago, I was really surprised

1409
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:43,420
when it moved out here and saw 7-11s, but I would go to any one of them and there would

1410
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:46,660
always be some sort of game, whether it worked or not was another story, but there would

1411
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:49,380
be a game there, so it was weird.

1412
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:52,740
Now you can find good arcade machines though at truck stops.

1413
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,700
I found Derby Owners Club at a truck stop.

1414
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:55,700
Good times.

1415
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,380
Alright, well, Rob D., we've been on the phone a while now, so I gotta ask you so we can

1416
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:02,780
get some more calls, any last thoughts, any other things you wanna say?

1417
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:03,780
Uh...

1418
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:04,780
Pawa Dunk!

1419
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,780
I'll just send it there.

1420
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,780
Alright, have a good one, Rob.

1421
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:08,780
See you guys later.

1422
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:09,780
Bye.

1423
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,780
Bye.

1424
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,620
I guess he was getting some bad echo on the line, I don't know how that happened, happened,

1425
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,620
happened, happened, no just kidding.

1426
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:21,180
Alright, you can give us a call if you want, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1427
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:24,300
Loki, what was that story you were gonna read for us earlier?

1428
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:29,580
Uh, well apparently there's some really cool mods, character mods you can have for the

1429
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:34,020
PlayStation 3 version, or actually the PC version also of Unreal Tournament 3, including

1430
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,660
Master Chief.

1431
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:38,740
They also have the guy from Crysis.

1432
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:45,500
There's also, of course, Marcus Fenix, and Cloud, and Spawn.

1433
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:52,580
And actually the one for Halo, I gotta say, looks better than the Xbox 360 version.

1434
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:53,580
Let's go to the phones.

1435
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,580
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1436
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,580
Who's this?

1437
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,580
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1438
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,580
I finally got in.

1439
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,580
It's DJ Dark Knight.

1440
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,580
Hi, DJ Dark Knight.

1441
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,580
What's on your mind?

1442
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,580
Uh, not much.

1443
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:06,180
I was surprised you guys didn't talk about Guitar Hero DS.

1444
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:07,180
We did.

1445
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:09,740
You might have arrived late to the show, it was early in Part A.

1446
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:16,660
Well, I remember I saw Peripheral about it, and all I could think of is, ugh, major cramps

1447
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:19,060
for that game, I swear.

1448
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,060
I don't think so.

1449
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,060
I don't know.

1450
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:26,800
Cause it's gonna be just like you're holding the guitar usually, but I think it'd be very

1451
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,860
comfortable actually, cause the keys are sideways.

1452
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:34,420
It's not like on top, that would cramp your hands, but your hand actually slides through

1453
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:38,860
like a little velcro holder thing, and it still looks like a carpal tunnel nightmare

1454
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:39,860
to me.

1455
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:40,860
I don't know.

1456
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:41,860
Yeah.

1457
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:44,460
Yeah, I mean, it'll probably, like I said, it'll probably work out, but it doesn't mean,

1458
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:48,500
I know in my case, the way my hands are, I know it's not gonna work too well for me.

1459
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:52,980
Um, I was thinking about something else that totally slipped my mind, cause that was the

1460
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,980
main thing I wanted to talk about.

1461
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:58,740
Um, something about the live 365 thing, that does suck.

1462
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,700
That does suck major balls, I know.

1463
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:04,300
It sucks and it's nice, like, you know, I'm hearing from people who are offering to

1464
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:09,140
help pay for the increased fees and all that, which I think is really nice, but at the same

1465
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:12,580
time you have to, I just want everybody to understand part of the reason that we're leaving

1466
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:18,420
is because we disagree with the rate increase of such significance, and the fact that maybe

1467
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:22,580
it's just time for the station to have a kick in the butt and, uh, you know, try something

1468
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,580
a little different.

1469
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:27,380
You know, we've been doing it the same way for five and a half years, so we're just trying

1470
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,980
to see the positives and what is kind of otherwise a depressing thing, and I know it's really

1471
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:35,300
going to suck because it displaces, um, our weeknight shows, at least for right now.

1472
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:40,460
I mean, we're hoping we can take them with us wherever we end up, but, uh, you know,

1473
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:44,740
it's going to be some growing pains, but I'm hoping in the long run it actually ends up

1474
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:45,740
as a good thing.

1475
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:51,220
Well, I gotta say, if you ever need a spot for Shoutcast, we got lines open.

1476
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:55,660
I appreciate it, you know, and I know a lot of people are saying Shoutcast and it's definitely

1477
01:14:55,660 --> 01:15:00,380
a possibility, uh, we have ideas and we'll see what happens.

1478
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,860
The other thing about Shoutcast, too, is you got to pay for music licensing if we were

1479
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,940
going to do something like that, so.

1480
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,700
But then, you know, all the video game music, I mean, we just, I mean, I think no matter

1481
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,500
what happens, unfortunately, we're going to have to get rid of our licensed music in,

1482
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:19,020
in terms of the cage match that we do every week and the, uh, you know, any shows we had

1483
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:23,540
where we were playing a lot of licensed music, like unfortunately Jamie's old show, uh, Matt's

1484
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,060
mix show, you know, things like that.

1485
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,060
Hell, my show when I play that.

1486
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,620
Oh darn, we'll have to get rid of that show that we got rid of, like, a year ago.

1487
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:31,860
Well, you know what I mean, but you talked about bringing it back, too, and, you know,

1488
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,220
it's just, uh, not gonna, it can't happen now, so.

1489
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,220
We'll see what happens.

1490
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,220
We don't know.

1491
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:40,540
We can always resurrect that My Name Is God-O mix.

1492
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:43,180
But I don't know, when it comes to video game music, it feels differently to me.

1493
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,380
I don't think, you know, it seems like a different realm.

1494
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:48,100
I, I would, I would go underground with video game music.

1495
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,100
I think we'd be okay.

1496
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,100
Yeah.

1497
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,820
Yeah, um, like I said, good luck on that one.

1498
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:53,820
Um.

1499
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:54,820
Thank you.

1500
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:57,780
Like I said, other than that, though, um, of course, me being the fancy star of Universe

1501
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:01,420
Fanatic, uh, finally back on the game and whatnot, it's officially White Day in the

1502
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,420
game and whatnot.

1503
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:07,260
I keep meaning to sign on and just kind of, like, play around in Fantasy Star Universe

1504
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:12,740
and see if I, I don't know, like it again, um, but I keep, just keep getting sidetracked,

1505
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,140
stupid wow and stuff like that.

1506
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:17,740
Well, like Gary said, you can't really enjoy it unless you get the expansion, of course.

1507
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:22,220
Once you get the expansion, then yeah, you can do, enjoy the newer stuff, but I mean,

1508
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:26,500
if you still just have the basic ones, you're still not gonna, you won't get, you won't

1509
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,220
be able to get all the new, be able to do all the new stuff and whatnot.

1510
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,220
Is these, expansion is what, 20 bucks?

1511
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,220
15 bucks?

1512
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,220
20 bucks?

1513
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:34,220
Um, I don't know.

1514
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,220
I don't look into it.

1515
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,220
I really don't know.

1516
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,220
I know on live, you can, on live, you can download it.

1517
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:39,220
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1518
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,220
On live, you can download it.

1519
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,220
Because I have to uninstall it.

1520
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,220
40 bucks?

1521
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,220
Geez.

1522
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,220
I don't know about that.

1523
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,220
Yeah, that's a bit much.

1524
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:52,180
But yeah, I mean, I, like I said, I still play that, I still play that game because

1525
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:56,180
it gives, it keeps me from playing, it's the only game I play on my PlayStation 2 now.

1526
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,180
That's the sad part.

1527
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,980
I don't play anything else on it.

1528
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:00,980
But anyway.

1529
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,780
Uh, anything else you want to share, Dark Knight, with our listeners?

1530
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:07,820
Uh, no one else about it, but um, permission to plug?

1531
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:10,020
Oh, hell, why not?

1532
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,020
Because we like ya.

1533
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:17,560
Okay, um, I kind of blend my voice to two shows on radio station called Disagenius Radio.

1534
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,540
One is my show called DJ Dark Knight's Ninja Dojo, and the number one is called, um, Anime

1535
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:28,220
Damashi on there, which is hosted by, um, the Rob D, me, Foodie Monster, and I guess

1536
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:33,380
the others, which is basically anime show, all, um, anime podcast shows.

1537
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,940
Tune in if you like, we on, we got podcasts out and everything, so.

1538
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:37,940
Nice.

1539
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,940
Alright, that's it.

1540
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:41,740
Have a good night, enjoy your Easter, talk to y'all later.

1541
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,740
Alright, have a good one.

1542
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,740
Bye.

1543
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,740
Bye.

1544
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,740
What do you think?

1545
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:47,740
One more call?

1546
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:48,740
We'll do one more call.

1547
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:49,740
Sure.

1548
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:50,740
Uno mas.

1549
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:57,460
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1550
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:01,020
If we are going to be doing a break from live broadcasting for a little while and going

1551
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:06,880
to tape, we will be sure to, uh, have more time for calls next week as we, uh, say goodbye

1552
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,220
to Live Thesis 5, because believe it or not, next week is going to be our last show on

1553
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:11,820
Live Thesis 5 no matter what.

1554
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,820
It's kind of odd.

1555
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:16,140
Kind of scary in a way.

1556
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,140
Eh.

1557
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,140
Eh.

1558
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,140
That's, uh, Loki's attitude.

1559
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:21,140
Whatever.

1560
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:25,020
Do you have any other last minute stories for us, Loki?

1561
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,020
Yeah.

1562
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:30,880
This week in the US, uh, Virtual Console will be getting King's Knight on the NES and Power

1563
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,940
Ball on Genesis.

1564
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,500
I don't know what either one of those are.

1565
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,500
Sorry.

1566
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,060
That was something else.

1567
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:41,140
I'm saving it for later.

1568
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,140
Okay.

1569
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,140
Let's see here.

1570
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:54,060
So, uh, what have we got here, apparently some idiot is working on Mac OS X or something

1571
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:57,460
that resembles Mac OS X for the PSP.

1572
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:58,940
Why?

1573
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,340
Why?

1574
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:05,220
Uh, there's some homebrew thing that someone made apparently that will remove duplicate

1575
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:08,740
channels that you may have from playing import games.

1576
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:11,820
Uh, so that's kind of neat.

1577
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:22,580
Let's see here, and, uh, some rumors from EGM, including Tech Mobile is heading to the

1578
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:27,700
Wii and the classic version of the game is coming to the DS, and apparently Warren Spector's

1579
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:32,140
new Disney project that he's working on is a platformer and the goal is to give Mario

1580
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,940
a run for his money.

1581
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:37,940
The star of the big platformer would be none other than Mickey Mouse.

1582
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,100
Hmm.

1583
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,460
That'd be interesting.

1584
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,460
That's it.

1585
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,460
Alright.

1586
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,740
Well, we're actually going to go ahead and close the Skype line because I just realized

1587
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,020
we are running a little bit long.

1588
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:52,020
It's almost, it's already midnight on the east coast, nine o'clock here, so we'll take

1589
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,420
plenty more calls next week.

1590
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:54,420
Don't worry.

1591
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,480
Uh, we're going to go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thoughts though

1592
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,300
in the meantime because we're about ready to wrap up.

1593
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,260
So, uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought for us tonight?

1594
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:03,940
Milkshake.

1595
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:07,460
My final thought is I would really like my appetite back.

1596
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:12,420
Loki, my final thought is this chair is really uncomfortable.

1597
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,420
Sorry about that.

1598
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:14,420
It's alright.

1599
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:17,340
Hey, if I can find another fluffy chair like Dark Soccer is for cheap, I'll get one of

1600
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,340
those.

1601
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:21,540
This is metal, and that's why I keep standing up because it...

1602
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,420
No, I'm sorry.

1603
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:25,740
Alright, well, that's it.

1604
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:29,280
That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, and tune in again

1605
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:33,740
next week for the last show on Live 365 where hopefully we'll be able to tell you what the

1606
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,340
plan for the future is after that.

1607
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:40,660
Thank you guys as always for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1608
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,660
Really appreciate it.

1609
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:42,660
You guys are awesome.

1610
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,660
Thanks for supporting us.

1611
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:46,420
And remember, if you like Orange Lounge Radio, or even if you don't like this show, at least

1612
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:50,820
spread the word and help independent radio break through because we don't have advertising

1613
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:51,820
dollars.

1614
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,140
We don't have big magazines behind us.

1615
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,460
We don't have any of that.

1616
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:58,600
So that's going to do it.

1617
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,460
So until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.

1618
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,900
That's Dark Soccer.

1619
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:08,860
He's Loki, and together we are Orange Lounge Radio.

1620
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:16,300
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1621
